She visited him and ended spending a number of months there. In March 2004, she declared that she was prepared to act as a human shield in order to protect him from IDF attack. Zakaria Zubeidi is in his late twenties. As a child, he was part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian theatre troupe which met at his parents&apos; home. Aged 14, he was jailed for six months for throwing stones at an Israeli patrol. In total, he has spent seven years in Israeli prisons, where he gained a good command of Hebrew. During the Oslo years he spent two years working as a contractor for home renovations in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Over the course of the Al-Aqsa intifada, his mother and brother were killed by the IDF, two of his brothers were imprisoned, and his home was destroyed. He is married with two children. Since 2002, he has been the head of the Al-Aqsa Martyr brigades in Jenin. He has sent suicide bombers into Israel, killing scores of civilians. His face is permanently scarred from a &quot;workshop&quot; accident whilst trying to make a bomb. In addition, he has survived at least five Israeli assassination attempts. Tali Fahima is not your average leftist. Before her decision to meet Zubeidi, prompted by an interview with him in Haaretz, she had always voted Likud. Since the early 1990s, she had begun making contact with Palestinians (through www.hellopeace.net), prompting a visit from the general secret service (Shabak). Before long, she was crossing the check-point and heading to Jenin refugee camp. It is illegal for Israeli citizens to enter areas under &quot;full&quot; Palestinian autonomy - Area A under Oslo terminology. Somehow, she managed it anyway. And in October 2004 she upped the stakes: &quot;Only after the last assassination attempt the penny dropped. I understood they are going to kill him. If nothing else helps, I contemplate being a human shield for him...I am not familiar with the whole of Palestine, and I don&apos;t know if everyone is worthy of being saved. This man is.&quot; As a result of these comments, Fahima was indicted and accused of aiding the enemy during wartime, supporting a terrorist organisation, providing information to the enemy, having contact with a foreign enemy, and possession of an illegal weapon. In December 2005 she was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to meeting Zubeidi and spending time in Jenin. But the state retracted most of its allegations against her, particularly the charge that she had been complicit in suicide bombings. She agreed to confess to charges of revealing information to the enemy, contact with a foreign agent, and a ban on Israeli civilians entering Area A, in order to try and reduce her sentence. The first charge was particularly embarrassing to the government. The document in question was a bird&apos;s-eye view of Jenin, as well as some &quot;wanted&quot; blurbs. It had been mislaid by IDF personnel during a raid on the camp. Fahima admitted to &quot;translating&quot; them for Zubeidi, despite the fact that he is a fluent Hebrew speaker. The translation amounted to him showing her the document as a memento, and her replying &quot;It&apos;s a picture of Jenin. You are wanted&quot;. Today, Tali Fahima is finally due to be released from jail. And for anyone interested in a genuine Israeli-Palestinian rapprochement, she is nothing less than a hero. There can be no escaping the fact that we will have to talk to terrorists if we are going to make peace. By defying the laws banning Israelis from travelling to Area A, excessively paternalistic laws which serve to prevent the possibility of dialogue between the two communities, she has set an example as to how bridges might be built. The self-righteousness with which people cite Zubeidi&apos;s murderousness, as if our leaders were whiter than white, is astounding. These moral judgements must take second place to the urgent task of resuming Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, of which Tali Fahima has set the ultimate example.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-03T06:10:32Z", "title": "Dealing with the enemy", "sentences": ["During the Oslo years he spent two years working as a contractor for home renovations in Tel Aviv and Haifa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/03/forjanuary3"}, {"tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ehud Olmert"], "article": "A year ago today Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, was sitting at his farm in the Negev desert when he complained of chest pains. Sharon had suffered a minor stroke two weeks previously, so it was decided that he should be taken by ambulance to hospital in Jerusalem. At some point on the hour-long journey, he suffered a huge brain haemorrhage and lapsed into a coma, which has endured until now. That same evening Ehud Olmert, his deputy, was appointed prime minister, a position he has held ever since. Sharon&apos;s biggest achievement as prime minister was Israel&apos;s withdrawal from Gaza and the forging of a political group, Kadima, to carry out further withdrawals in the West Bank. But as one commentator remarked as the prime minister lay in hospital, &quot;If Sharon goes, everything changes.&quot; Sharon has left office but remains alive in a persistent vegetative state in Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv. Occasionally his eyes open, a common reflex in such cases. But his body is under constant attack from infection. His political legacy is also under siege. Gaza appears to be as great a problem for Israel as before, and Kadima&apos;s period of elected office has been beset by almost daily scandals. For his former colleagues in the Likud party, the withdrawal from Gaza was an unnecessary distraction from more important problems, such as Iran. For his former colleagues in the settler movement, Sharon&apos;s removal of Jewish communities was a fundamental error that endangered the existence of the state. Uzi Arad, a former advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu, said that while it was clear &quot;disengagement&quot; from Gaza had not lived up to the promises that Sharon had made for it, only time would tell whether it was a catastrophic diversion of attention for Israel. &quot;Only when we know if Iran succeeds in acquiring nuclear weapons will we know if Sharon was wise to focus on Gaza rather than concentrating on the emerging threat from Iran,&quot; he said. &quot;If Iran goes nuclear, it will imply that Sharon was terribly wrong in insisting on disengagement from Gaza, which was a non-urgent and non-relevant matter, which could have been carried out 10 years before or 10 years after.&quot; Many of today&apos;s problems in Gaza were inherent in Sharon&apos;s plan. Little attention was paid to how Gaza was going to interact with the outside world, the West Bank and Israel, and an isolated and impoverished enclave was unlikely to prosper or remain stable. But Sharon stood for more than one disengagement, and it was to this end that he broke the Israeli political status quo to form Kadima. Olmert, as Sharon&apos;s heir, persuaded the electorate to trust him, although with fewer votes than Sharon might have expected. Olmert enjoyed a three-month honeymoon as caretaker prime minister; the problems came when he was elected prime minister in his own right. &quot;Olmert&apos;s high point was his first three months, when he kept silent,&quot; said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. &quot;When he started to talk, he showed a lack of competence, courage and decisiveness. He projected a sense of power when he was with Sharon, but when Sharon went, so did the power.&quot; Olmert presided over the messy formation of a coalition and a disastrous war that would have been a difficult problem even for Sharon. Allegations of corruption and criminality at the heart of government continued to emerge all year. A survey of the Israeli press reveals a sense of crisis in the army, bureaucracy and government. The president faces charges of rape. The former minister of justice is being tried for sexual assault. The prime minister, like Sharon, is encumbered with corruption investigations. And there are 40 investigations into Israel&apos;s conduct of its war in Lebanon this summer. In an opinion poll published in Ha&apos;aretz on Thursday, 77% said they believed Olmert was not doing a good job, and 60% believed his personal integrity was &quot;not good&quot;. Even with Kadima, only 25% believe Olmert should be prime minister, with 60% preferring Tzippi Livni, the foreign minister. Sharon did not articulate what the second phase of disengagement would be, but strategists guessed that it would mean a dismantling of settlements outside the security barrier. The political failure of Olmert, which the Lebanon war compounded, means it is all but impossible that there will be further withdrawals in the term of this government. &quot;Sharon&apos;s most recent legacy was the decision to reverse the settlement project and unfold them,&quot; said Ezrahi. &quot;The tragedy is that Olmert does not have the power to carry it on. Sharon&apos;s success was his enormous political power, which allowed him to defy his own party and create a new one. Olmert has demonstrated a failure in leadership which is even more stark in comparison to that of Sharon before him.&quot; Israel Harel, a settler leader who planned the expansion of settlements with Sharon for decades, believes Sharon&apos;s mistake was to court western opinion instead of focusing on the Middle Eastern strategic realities that govern Israel&apos;s existence. &quot;It turns out he left no legacy at all. He left a ruined country and a torn-apart society,&quot; he said. &quot;This was proven in the war. In the war there was no motivation to fight because the commanders had been infected by international and liberal trends that have no place in the Middle East.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-01-04T09:49:03Z", "title": "A year on: Ariel Sharon's legacy is under siege", "sentences": ["But as one commentator remarked as the prime minister lay in hospital, &quot;If Sharon goes, everything changes.&quot; Sharon has left office but remains alive in a persistent vegetative state in Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/04/israel1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "They said they wanted to teach her to be a &quot;good Jew&quot; as she sat with her arms handcuffed to the legs of her chair for 16 hours a day. But if Tali Fahima was not prepared to be a good Jew then Shin Bet, the Israeli secret service, was determined to put her in jail for as long as possible regardless of what she did. Ms Fahima, 30, was released from jail on Wednesday after serving almost 30 months in jail for travelling to the West Bank, meeting an enemy agent and translating a simple army document. &quot;My first crime was that I refused to work with Shin Bet, the second was that I insisted on going to see the Palestinians and the third was that I protested against the Israeli policy of assassination,&quot; Ms Fahima told the Guardian in her first interview since her release. For nine months of her incarceration she was kept in isolation, without access to any distractions such as books or television. &quot;I used to lie on my bed and think about Jenin, the people I met and wonder how things were going there. I never get bored on my own,&quot; she said. Eventually, Ms Fahima was persuaded by her lawyer to agree to a plea bargain which would mean her serving only 10 months more than the 19 she had already served. It could take as long as a year to be found innocent, she was advised. She is unbowed by her experience. &quot;I learnt about the nature of Shin Bet, how they terrorise us, both the Israelis and Palestinians. I learnt about the nature of the government, how they do not want us to see what is going on in our name,&quot; she said. Ms Fahima had been an apathetic legal secretary who voted for the rightwing Likud party and carried Israeli prejudices about Palestinians until in 2003 she decided she wanted to understand why the Palestinians were attacking Israel. She began making regular visits to Jenin, which had been devastated in an Israeli raid earlier that year. She talked to hundreds of people including Palestinian militants and for the first time heard the Palestinian view of the intifada and the difficulty of life under Israeli occupation. Her meetings with one militant, Zakaria Zubeidi, stood out. Zubeidi was the leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in Jenin whose mother and brother had been killed by the Israelis that year. In countless interviews with journalists, including Israelis, he described how he and his mother had been involved in an Israeli-Palestinian theatre project which was the basis of an internationally-acclaimed Israeli documentary, Arna&apos;s Children. A week before Ms Fahima was arrested in August 2004 she received a phone call from a Shin Bet agent who inquired how she was finding life without work before inviting her to a meeting at her local police station in Kiryat Gat in the south of Israel. She decided not to go. In the month-long interrogation that followed her arrest she was questioned about the people she had met and asked for information which Ms Fahima said she did not have. During this period Shin Bet agents briefed Israeli journalists she had been having an affair with Zubeidi, who was well known to Israelis from newspaper interviews. &quot;It was a Shin Bet tactic to make me and him seem bad and to delegitimise us both,&quot; she said, adding that while it was obvious to some that it was malicious, many, including friends, believed it. When she was finally charged she was accused of translating an army document which apparently detailed an arrest operation that was due to take place. &quot;In the wake of the explanations of the accused,&quot; read the charge sheet, &quot;Zubeidi later ordered the wanted persons to hide until the conclusion of the military operation and the wanted persons, who carried out Zubeidi&apos;s directive and hid, were not detained.&quot; The document contains three aerial maps of Jenin, and four photographs of wanted men, including Zubeidi, with a short description of each. Zubeidi speaks and reads Hebrew after years of work and imprisonment in Israel.

Fatah&apos;s strongman in Gaza, Muhammad Dahlan, was given a hero&apos;s welcome as he entered the stadium. The gathering was the largest Fatah demonstration in Gaza since 1994, when Yasser Arafat returned triumphantly to Gaza from exile in the framework of a partial peace deal with Israel. Fatah and Hamas have been locked in a bloody struggle for control of the Palestinian government since the Islamic group won parliamentary elections last year. The victory ended four decades of Fatah political domination, though the group still controls the powerful Palestinian presidency. Meanwhile, Israeli officials yesterday refused to confirm newspaper reports that Israel was planning to use small tactical nuclear weapons to destroy Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. The reports suggested that Israeli pilots were training to carry out a bombing mission on fortified bunkers believed to be used by Iran to protect its nuclear laboratories. The pilots would first fire conventional weapons and then follow up with small nuclear bombs. Miri Eisen, a spokeswoman for Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister refused to comment on the reports in yesterday&apos;s Sunday Times.

More than just a food, more than a dessert, it is a comforter and cure-all, a childhood treat few Americans outgrow. From the expedition for cones at a local stand to the bells of the Good Humor man driving round the streets, ice cream is America&apos;s celebration and solace. No one understood that better than Rose Mattus, who has died aged 90, and whose marketing of her husband Reuben&apos;s idea for a luxury ice cream brand transformed H\u00e4agen-Dazs from a local favourite into a national phenomenon. Rose Vesel, as she then was, was born in Manchester, to Polish immigrant parents who were theatrical costumers. They soon emigrated, via Belfast, to New York, settling in the then largely Jewish Brownsville section of Brooklyn. As a teenager Rose met Reuben Mattus, whose Russian immigrant family ran a small ice cream business. After finishing high school, she became a book-keeper with the firm, by this time known as Senator Frozen Foods, in the Bronx, and married Reuben in 1934. Together, they ran a profitable enterprise, which grew from selling ices on the street and at Coney Island to supplying restaurants and retailers all over New York. Local dairies across the US produced quality ice cream, generally sold in their own outlets or convenience stores. Supermarkets offered only a lesser product, concocted with dried milk and artificial flavours. But, in 1959, as the larger companies began to squeeze his business, Reuben decided to create a luxury version of Senator&apos;s own product, giving it the imported feel of a Danish-sounding name. Rose claimed they chose Denmark because of the way the Danes had saved their Jewish population from the Nazis by evacuating them en masse to Sweden. Reuben was looking for something with the classy ring of the premium bakery Duncan Hines, and settled on H\u00e4agen-Dazs, adding an umlaut over the first &quot;a&quot; even though umlauts do not exist in Danish, and the resulting three-vowel sound would be pronounced like a groan. Rose marketed the new ice cream by carrying samples to delicatessens all over New York. She was a dynamic saleswoman, and she was helped in the mid-1960s when she locked into what she called &quot;an alternative market steeped in marijuana culture&quot;. H\u00e4agen-Dazs, with its rich, high-fat content and larded with bits of sweets usually included as toppings on sundaes, was the hippie connoisseur&apos;s cure for the munchies. The appeal of flavours like &quot;Rocky Road&quot; spread so quickly that, without Rose buying any advertising, by the early 1970s H\u00e4agen-Dazs was the only premium brand in America with national distribution. As those baby-boomer hippies morphed into Reagan-era consumers, the Mattuses&apos; business continued to thrive: they moved to a new factory in Woodbridge, New Jersey, and in 1983 sold out to Pillsbury for $70m. Although the new owners had not made provision for Rose to remain, she made herself a fixture and stayed until the company was sold on to Grand Metropolitan in 1989 (it is now owned by Nestl\u00e9). Rose and Reuben were active supporters of Israel, and a school of high technology in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, bears their name. Rose&apos;s memoir, The Emperor of Ice Cream, appeared in 2004. Despite suffering diabetes, she remained addicted to ice cream - though she always preferred plain vanilla.

I as good as spat every time I walked past its well-manicured borders, reminded of the spectre of institutionalised anti-semitism which dogged the lives of my parents&apos; generation and, even today, the embers still glow faintly here and there. I worked in the stockmarket with a particularly odious individual who once boasted that he had &quot;no Indian clients - and, I assure you now, I never will&quot;. Had I been Indian, he&apos;d no doubt have told me just as proudly how he had no Jewish customers on his books. Fine - my experiences are hardly unique, and neither were they particularly distressing to me at the time. Then I moved to Israel and, where once we were the hunted, now we became earnest hunters instead. I&apos;m not going to weigh into the heavyweight arena, discussing borders, right of return for refugees, and so on - rather, I want to draw attention to yet another example of how we&apos;ve descended to the levels of our anti-semitic foes. Israeli newspapers last week reported that several communal heads, in the ultra-orthodox stronghold of Bnei Brak, had co-signed a letter forbidding locals from &quot;renting their apartments to Arabs&quot;. I might add here that it&apos;s not the word &quot;Arabs&quot; that bothers me so much in this case - it could just as easily be &quot;secular Jews&quot; or &quot;homosexuals&quot;, for that matter. Rather, it is the premise that the area&apos;s rabbis, who run the city with an iron fist, should be able to call the shots for the entire populace of Bnei Brak. It&apos;s a much-touted opinion that the haredim (ultra-orthodox) are on the brink of wresting power from the secular in Israel and, based on the current state of play, I&apos;d agree that we&apos;re not a million miles away from that scenario. The haredim don&apos;t live in the same Israel as I do. I live in a democracy, whilst they are under the control of an all-encompassing theocracy. I can vote for who I like, whilst they vote en masse, for whichever candidate their chief rabbi declares is the worthiest choice. In this manner, the haredim very skillfully bypass the usual machinations of democratic policy-making, by horse-trading their influence for sympathetic budgets and the like, unravelling carefully-pieced-together coalitions whenever they don&apos;t get their way. Fair enough - it&apos;s their right, after all, and if they choose to cast their ballots in this way, who am I to cry foul? But when it comes to all us Jews being tarred with the same brush, then I wish these rabbis would think first, and act a lot, lot later. Because banning property rentals to Arabs is just &quot;No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish&quot; all over again. And, no matter how vocally I try to distance myself from them, the average outsider reading &quot;Jews refuse to have Arab neighbours&quot; won&apos;t make the distinction between me and my black-hatted friends. Just as I don&apos;t distinguish between MCC members - if they sit idly by whilst their comrades exclude women from joining, then they&apos;re all as guilty as each other. On top of the racist posturing of these rabbis, there is also the siege mentality aspect of this case. Presumably Arabs are barred from the area out of concern that their presence would destroy the social fabric that the community leaders seek to preserve. Likewise secular Jews would not be welcome, for fear that they would &quot;corrupt&quot; the innocent youth of the religious families. But isolating yourself on purpose, refusing to integrate with those of different persuasions, can only lead to polarisation. Which in turn can only lead to mistrust, fear and contempt. Good friends of mine recently moved to the mainly-Arab area of Jaffa, in Tel Aviv. As Jews, they weren&apos;t exactly welcomed with open arms by the locals, but at least their presence helped break down barriers. The Arab residents see them daily, greet them cautiously at their front door, and gradually they will accept them as they do any other neighbours. Which is a far cry from the hysterical blanket ban issued by the zealots of Bnei Brak. It is one thing for a private club to cling fast to archaic rules and regulations, quite another for a government to do so. And, in all but name, Bnei Brak&apos;s coterie of rabbis are just that - a governing body, who should know better than to build their own invisible security wall around their city. Arabs, secular Jews, whoever - refusing to share the same streets with those of another persuasion is not something we, as Jews, should encourage.

Whatever its dramatic flaws, the play is of obvious historical importance in its relevance to Israel&apos;s own &quot;refuseniks&quot;, who declined to serve in the occupied Palestinian territories. Sobol&apos;s nominal subject is Franz Jagerstatter, an Austrian mechanic and farmer who conscientiously objected to serving in the German army. We see him in a Berlin jail in 1943, shortly before his execution, where he voluntarily took on the dirtiest jobs available. A prison doctor, conscripted friends and a puzzled pastor all visit, urging Franz to sign a declaration of repentance. Dream images of his wife and daughter and a former lover also appear to remind him of the cost of his sacrifice. But Franz remains heroically adamant, arguing that, since &quot;our fuhrer has broken all the rules of humanity&quot;, it would be criminal to don a uniform. What emerges is a moving portrait of Franz&apos;s earthly sanctity: written at a time when 600 Israeli pilots and soldiers were refusing to bear arms, the play has a palpable metaphorical power. But it would be stronger, dramatically, if Franz were more prey to temptation. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Christian theologian who was similarly victimised, wrote that &quot;evil approaches the objector in so many respectable and seductive disguises that his conscience becomes nervous and vacillating&quot;. Apart from one brief moment, when he contemplates becoming a hospital orderly to relieve the suffering, Franz, however, remains unyielding in his opposition. This is the nub of the matter: all the great nay-sayers of world drama, from Shaw&apos;s Saint Joan to Miller&apos;s John Proctor, seek an escape clause on the road to death. But, while one admires Franz for arguing that he has borne witness to the evil others ignore, his implacability makes him a less complex protagonist. It is left to the actor Mel Raido, who has a fine bony intensity, to supply the internal tension missing in the text. He is staunchly supported by Leah Muller, who lends his first love a wispy sensuality, and by Richard Atwill, who notably doubles as a survival-conscious chauffeur and a bewildered priest. Michael Ronen&apos;s production, filled with the sound of pans being scoured and shoes scrubbed, brilliantly evokes Franz&apos;s ferocious work ethic.

In defiance of international condemnation and last month&apos;s UN security council resolution, Iran is pressing ahead with a programme of uranium enrichment that it claims is only for civilian energy but is widely suspected of concealing a bid to build a nuclear warhead. Is there anything the world can do to stop it - if indeed there is a pressing case for doing so? According to recent leaks in the Israeli and British press, Israel believes that military action is the only answer. Officials in Tel Aviv argue that a nuclear bomb in Tehran&apos;s hands poses an unacceptable risk, one that a massive onslaught by warplanes - perhaps deploying Israel&apos;s own nuclear arsenal - could pre-empt and smash. The Israelis may have a number of motives for spinning this story. They may be trying to intimidate Tehran, or soften up world opinion in advance of a strike. They could also be pressing Washington into taking a harder line with Iran. But what is certain is that the use of military force against Tehran would be an unmitigated disaster for everyone involved, not just the civilians incinerated in such an attack. Not only would military strikes be unlikely to knock out targets that are well dispersed and defended, they would provoke deadly retaliation by Tehran&apos;s proxies in Iraq and Afghanistan against British and US servicemen; the price of oil would rocket, particularly if Iranian commanders retaliated by disrupting tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz; and throughout in the Muslim world and beyond massive popular reaction could well bring down pro-western regimes. It is not as if Iran presents any immediate, compelling threat. Israeli officials argue that a nuclear bomb in the hands of a man who talks about Israel being &quot;eliminated from the pages of time&quot; poses an unacceptable risk, but he wields no power in foreign affairs. Moreover, Israel&apos;s nuclear deterrent would mean mutually assured destruction. Most of Iran&apos;s critics continue to regard economic sanctions as an effective diplomatic tool, and last month the UN security council finally passed a resolution that imposed very mild sanctions on the Iranian regime for its nuclear non-compliance. Washington will be pushing for more if, as seems likely, Iran&apos;s enrichment programme goes on. But this would be more seriously resisted by Iran&apos;s allies on the council, Russia and China. That is not to say that the US has no way of hitting the Iranian economy. It has put huge pressure on international banks not to back Iranian ventures, forcing many foreign businesses to curb their own trade and investment there. This has been particularly hard on Iran&apos;s oil sector, which earns nearly all the economy&apos;s foreign exchange. Yet such measures are unlikely to thwart Tehran, which will offer foreign contractors better terms or strike up closer relations with Chinese companies. But even if sanctions did have any real economic impact, the effect would be more likely to rally ordinary Iranians to their country&apos;s nuclear cause. A civilian nuclear programme attracts wide popular support and most Iranians can hardly fail to see their nuclear cause as perfectly reasonable. Under the 1968 non-proliferation treaty, their country has an &quot;inalienable right&quot; to produce nuclear energy &quot;for peaceful purposes&quot;; and though their leaders have a track record of duplicity, most Iranians point to glaring double standards. Many other countries have been left free to pursue enrichment programmes, while others, such as India and Israel, are nuclear powers but have never signed the treaty. Their history shows why Iranians are quick to sense injustice. For 2,000 years they have been subjugated by invaders and oppressors, from the Arabs to the Russian tsars. In the early 1950s the great Iranian nationalist Mohammed Mossadeq knew better than most how his fellow countrymen resented such iniquity. For two arduous years he rallied them to support his nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, urging them to resist devastating British sanctions with a Shia spirit of self-sacrifice and martyrdom, until he was overthrown in a US and British-backed coup. The same historical experiences explain why Iran has good reason to fear for its national security. How ironic, then, that its critics spin rumours of military strikes or talk openly of regime change in a way that would make any country want an ultimate deterrent of its own. Here lies the crux of the Iranian nuclear dilemma. Threats to deny any country its inalienable rights, or the means to defend itself against nuclear neighbours, are always likely to fall on deaf ears. And to talk to Iranians in such terms is likely only to inflame their worst fears. If Iranians are to change their attitudes, America and its allies need to change theirs. They need to accept that Iran has as much right as any country to pursue a programme of civilian energy, and it cannot be blamed for pursuing nuclear weapons when it is surrounded by countries - Israel, Pakistan and the US - that have their own. To dissuade the Iranians from pursuing either goal - nuclear energy or warheads - Washington would have to make massive concessions. It would need to fit the issue into a wider Middle East picture and find ways of making Iran feel less threatened. In return for cessation of uranium enrichment, or for more effective guarantees that it would not be used for a weapons programme, Washington could offer not only to lift all sanctions but also to drop calls for regime change and undertake not to meddle in Iran&apos;s domestic affairs; pull back its military presence in the region; and pressure Israel into surrendering or scaling down its nuclear arsenal. Israel talks about its defence against annihilation, but it might be such wider consequences of an Iranian nuclear programme that it really fears. Unfortunately, Bush looks a long way from even considering such moves. He has rejected the recommendations of last month&apos;s Baker-Hamilton report, which called for dialogue with Tehran after 26 years of estrangement, and of congressmen who have called for a &quot;grand bargain&quot; to settle all the differences between Iran and the US. By doing so, he has dramatically raised the stakes in the Middle East. In the coming months there is a real risk that Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions could spark conflicts that make Iraq and Afghanistan look like small fry indeed.\u00b7 Roger Howard is the author of Iran Oil: the New Middle East Challenge and What&apos;s Wrong with Liberal Interventionism howard1966@btinternet.com", "publicationDate": "2007-01-11T00:16:40Z", "title": "Roger Howard: Neither sanctions nor bombs will end the Iran nuclear crisis", "sentences": ["Officials in Tel Aviv argue that a nuclear bomb in Tehran&apos;s hands poses an unacceptable risk, one that a massive onslaught by warplanes - perhaps deploying Israel&apos;s own nuclear arsenal - could pre-empt and smash."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/11/comment.iran"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Society"], "article": "Let It Be Morningby Sayed Kashua, translated by Miriam Shlesinger271pp, Atlantic Books, \u00a38.99 The Illusion of Returnby Samir El-Youssef154pp, Halban, \u00a312.99 With diaspora and displacement among the defining conditions of Palestinian life since 1948, Palestinian literature has found expression in several forms. Poetry, memoirs and short fiction have been favoured. But Sayed Kashua (who writes in Hebrew) and Samir El-Youssef in English are relatively rare in using the novel form. Kashua&apos;s debut, Dancing Arabs (2002), drew with humour and despair on his experiences as an &quot;Israeli Arab&quot; coming of age as a watchful navigator across borders, between his Arab village in Galilee and the &quot;Jewish&quot; city, between Hebrew and Arabic, and between mutually hostile groups. His second, disturbing and powerfully accomplished novel, Let It Be Morning, amplifies these tensions in the wake of the al-Aqsa intifada sparked in October 2000, when Israeli Palestinians found themselves hostage to the worsening security situation and increasingly repudiated by their own state. The narrator is a journalist on a Hebrew newspaper in Tel Aviv, who resolves to return with his wife and baby to his Arab village in Israel&apos;s borderlands with the West Bank, after a 10-year absence. Though, as an Arab, he can reach the parts other Israeli reporters cannot, his editors view him with increasing suspicion, and he longs for a place of safety. He cravenly toes the line and censors himself to avoid being seen as a &quot;fifth column biting the hand that was feeding it&quot;, but professions of loyalty prove fruitless. As a construction worker tells him, &quot;They can&apos;t tell the difference between people like us, living inside Israel, and the ones living on the West Bank. An Arab&apos;s an Arab as far as they&apos;re concerned.&quot; Through the narrator&apos;s self-disgust, the villagers&apos; self-serving values - their materialism and paternalism - are skewered as unsparingly as the discrimination they face. Yet their compromising accommodations are linked to their dependence. Internalising their status as Israeli Arabs, they despise the West Bank Palestinians whom they exploit as illegal day-labourers. When Israeli tanks inexplicably seal off the village, cutting off all supplies, water, electricity and phone links, the novel descends into nightmare. Efforts to escape or resist are met with bullets and shelling, forcing the villagers to compete with growing brutality to survive. In one chilling episode, the illegal workers are rounded up and stripped to appease the faceless army, which, uninterested, shoots two of them dead. Through its poignant focus on a single family, Let It Be Morning offers a riveting study of human values collapsing under inhuman conditions, with unsuitable messiahs, or &quot;heroes of resistance&quot;, rising in the vacuum. Much turns upon what constitutes &quot;normality&quot;, and how the unthinkable becomes acceptable. While the landscape of roadblocks and barbed wire, festering garbage and overflowing sewage, mirrors the abnormal normality of the West Bank and Gaza (with which Kashua is familiar as a journalist), the final revelations push exclusive notions of statehood to an absurd logical extreme. Israeli Arabs, says the narrator, are seen &quot;as a threat, as something that calls for a solution&quot;. Failure to see their discriminatory treatment as a &quot;blatant breach of normal relations between citizens and their country&quot; paves the way for greater political betrayal. In its absurdist thought experiment and incremental atmosphere of surreal uncertainty and fear, Let It Be Morning is reminiscent of Orwell and Kafka along with Joseph Heller&apos;s Catch-22. That Kashua&apos;s mordant take on the humiliations of Palestinian life within Israel recalls aspects of the prewar European ghetto is an irony underlined by his writing in Hebrew - rendered into poised American English by Miriam Shlesinger. Samir El-Youssef, who was born in Lebanon, has lived in London since 1990. His short stories in Gaza Blues (2004), co-authored with the Israeli writer Etgar Keret, drew irreverently on his experience of growing up in a refugee camp, seemingly in a pot-haze. The Illusion of Return is his first novel in English, but despite the misleadingly portentous title, it is not really about a Palestinian &quot;right of return&quot; - which its narrator rejects as unrealistic. Centred on a meeting in Heathrow airport between two friends who fled wartorn Lebanon for Britain and the US in the 80s, the novel&apos;s heart lies in its narrator&apos;s grappling with a past which includes the death of his sister 10 years earlier and the murder of a friend. Like Kashua, El-Youssef is unflinchingly critical of aspects of his society, not least what he sees as hypocrisy in the treatment of women. Puncturing myth to allow for grief and understanding, the novel attempts to reveal a more complex human reality behind the smokescreen of tales of heroism and martyrdom.  \u00b7 Maya Jaggi was a judge of the inaugural Banipal prize for Arabic literary translation", "publicationDate": "2007-01-13T23:47:35Z", "title": "Review: Let It Be Morning by Sayed Kashua and The Illusion of Return by Samir El-Youssef", "sentences": ["The narrator is a journalist on a Hebrew newspaper in Tel Aviv, who resolves to return with his wife and baby to his Arab village in Israel&apos;s borderlands with the West Bank, after a 10-year absence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview19"}, {"tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "I always wear a dinner jacket. I never have this definition of what goes for the morning or the evening or what works for the weekend. I like having the freedom to dress as I desire. But yes, I do wear a dinner jacket for dinner. I like to respect that sort of dress code although I often machine-wash my tuxedo so it looks very mucked-up and I will wear a bow tie, but I don&apos;t do it perfectly because I don&apos;t know how to do that knot, so I do it my way. Usually, I spend my day perfecting a dress rather than perfecting myself. Thank God I don&apos;t have to look like a model to promote my work, because that would be a catastrophe. Nobody would buy anything! I&apos;m behind the scenes. I could be on a diet of leaves and go to the gym 17 times a week if I really wanted it, but what I really want to do is my work. But I have asked myself: if I had a different look, would I design differently? And I think I would. I think the fact that I never feel perfect and I never feel beautiful and I never feel skinny makes me search for lightness and beauty, because these are what I feel I am missing. I always go for whatever I think I don&apos;t have. If I wasn&apos;t a designer I would love to be a doctor. That is my fantasy, my dream. A doctor will give you a tablet if you have a headache and I will give you a dress and we both make you feel good. The name I was born with is Albert, with a &apos;t&apos;. I lost the &apos;t&apos; because I moved to New York and I thought, it just doesn&apos;t sound good, &apos;Albert&apos;, not pronounced like at home, &apos;Alber&apos;, so I took off the &apos;t&apos; and got into coffee so I could live in New York, though now I live in Paris. In Judaism, in Kabbalah, which we studied in school, every letter has a power. By changing your name, you might change your life and when I took that letter out, my life did change. I was introduced to a rhythm, a speed I never had before. When I was in kindergarten in Tel Aviv, I didn&apos;t do any drawings of aeroplanes, only dresses, and my mother asked the teacher if that was OK and the teacher said, &apos;Let him do it&apos;. Is my mother an influence? You know, there would be an interesting survey on designers and their mothers. Mine - her name is Alegria - is an elegant woman but it&apos;s not like one of those stories of, &apos;Oh, my mother had this beautiful sable coat from Christian Dior and she wore it in Switzerland&apos;. My father, who was a hair colourist, died when I was young so my mother had to work very hard. But at the same time, I do believe that if you have everything, it is easy to make a dinner. When you only have flour and water and olives and potatoes, you have to be much more creative and that&apos;s what my mother is all about. She had very little but from nothing she always made something. Some of my clothes I keep forever. I have a pair of blue shoes by Dries van Noten I wore to a meeting that changed my career. They are still my lucky shoes. But mostly I wear black. I work by looking at what I am creating in the mirror and I want to stay in the shadows. I keep my clothes for a long time. I&apos;m not changing every season any more than I am designing a new collection and throwing the last one out. I have things I have worn again and again, but over the years, I alter them, I make them longer, shorter, I change the armhole, I change the shoulder. One of my biggest fears is arriving to the airport and checking in my suitcase because I never know if I will get it back, and I wear the same clothes, you see, day and night, winter and summer. As to seeing women in my designs, of course I get excited. I&apos;m not a blas\u00e9 guy. I&apos;m not taking things for granted. I&apos;m not on a high from my own work or anything, I&apos;m very realistic; I work and I know what I create has to go from my studio to a certain reality check. The easiest thing would be to name some celebrity, but it is very impressive if someone wants something to wear to the Oscars. Of course it is like, &apos;Wow!&apos; But I get the same thrill when I am in the boutique and I see a woman and she looks good and she looks at herself in a different way; then it is no longer about the dress but how she feels. That touches me and it moves me. Have I had tough times? I believe in karma and I believe things happen for a reason. Ghandi said that at the end of our lives we will be sorry only for what we have not done. So if you do a lot, you go through a lot. I take nothing for granted and today I know things happened for a reason and it pushed me to a better place. At the time [of being fired from YSL] I was sorry. I am grateful now. I think this is a fascinating time in design. Vintage is over. This is going to be a very important moment in fashion because we cannot just reproduce; we did the Twenties already, we did the Thirties, the Fifties, the Sixties, up to the Nineties.

The former teacher takes over as host of Radio 4&apos;s Westminster Hour today, a role that confirms her status as one of the BBC&apos;s most senior broadcasters - yet it&apos;s difficult to imagine her complaining loudly that her coffee is too milky when it&apos;s delivered to her desk by a genuflecting Radio 4 underling. Quinn is simply too nice for that. Over coffee and croissants, she generously pays tribute to the man she will replace at Westminster Hour, Observer columnist Andrew Rawnsley, who created &apos;a good programme&apos; and improved ratings. The show has a 16 per cent audience share and 600,000 listeners - not bad considering most Radio 4 listeners are in the bath or in bed when it goes out on Sunday evenings. Quinn will make some &apos;incremental&apos; changes, however, introducing a panel of backbench MPs who &apos;will become friends of the programme&apos;. Ed Vaizey, a member of David Cameron&apos;s inner circle, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone and Labour&apos;s Kitty Ussher will take the political temperature each week - rather like Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo on Andrew Neil&apos;s This Week. There will also be coverage of the political blogs that have become an important part of the Westminster village, but the programme&apos;s gentle pace will not change. &apos;You don&apos;t want to be hectoring at 10 on a Sunday night,&apos; she says. Quinn will work two days a week at Today, and stand in for Eddie Mair at Saturday PM. This, she says, will allow her ample time to wander Whitehall in search of stories for the weekend. It is familiar terrain for Quinn, who spent a decade as a BBC political correspondent, first for regional radio and then for Five Live and Radio 4. Highlights included an exclusive interview with Gordon Brown when he was stuck on the tarmac at Tel Aviv after being recalled for a crucial Commons vote. Her report on Margaret Thatcher&apos;s resignation was also memorable, but for the wrong reason. &apos;Because I&apos;m so small [about 5&apos;2&quot;] I could only see the top of her head, so I said &quot;She looks on remarkably good form&quot;.&apos; In fact, Thatcher was - famously - being driven away in tears. Quinn&apos;s elevation to the Today programme in 2004 placed her under a degree of scrutiny - a new presenter must win over one of the most demanding audiences in the country. &apos;BBC bosses have got a problem because John Humphrys is bigger than the programme,&apos; claims one senior BBC editor. Big names are reluctant to join because they don&apos;t want to play second fiddle, but &apos;it is high-profile enough to break someone with potential&apos;. Quinn takes exception to suggestions that she is a member of the supporting cast: &apos;It&apos;s not the John Humphrys show. I think the editor would be with me on that. It&apos;s a programme with five presenters. John is obviously a very important part of it. He&apos;s got an amazing work ethic, but he&apos;s also very generous to colleagues.&apos; Humphrys is famed for his grumpy haranguing of ministers - and his interruptions. Quinn describes her interviewing style as &apos;robust&apos; and &apos;rigorous&apos;, if not necessarily combative. She shrugs off accusations of letting interviewees off the hook. &apos;We&apos;ve all sat at home and shouted &quot;Why don&apos;t you ask them that!&quot; at the radio.&apos; She later concedes: &apos;I&apos;ve learned a lot and I&apos;m still learning&apos;, but rejects the notion that female interviewers adopt a less adversarial approach than their male counterparts - citing Today colleague Sarah Montague and Newsnight&apos;s Kirsty Wark. &apos;If a woman tries to be tough, she&apos;s accused of being strident. If a man does it, he&apos;s taking control of the interview. But I think that attitude is dying out.&apos; Quinn switched to journalism in her twenties after teaching French at a London comprehensive. She joined the Irish Post after telling the editor she was a devoted reader. &apos;I lied a bit,&apos; she confesses. She landed a place on a BBC graduate scheme soon after and worked her way up from Radio Solent to Radio 4. Now there are few ambitions left unfulfilled. &apos;I&apos;d love to be the one to break the date of Tony Blair&apos;s departure.

The Israeli, a former sports journalist, is not even an agent in the traditional sense; mostly he does not act for players to negotiate their contracts with clubs. Instead he largely works for clubs themselves, here, in Italy, South America and elsewhere, being paid for brokering deals to sign or sell players, appoint managers or even, more recently, to smooth takeovers of the clubs themselves. He has never been shy about making his portion of the vast global flow of football money and is thought by many to be the highest earner in English football, including players and managers. The \u00a33m payable over five years if Yakubu stays at Middlesbrough represents the largest agent&apos;s fee yet disclosed in English football and it also highlights Zahavi&apos;s growing influence in the sport, nurtured with contacts built up over many years. He first moved from sports writing into arranging player transfers in 1979, when he brokered Liverpool&apos;s \u00a3200,000 purchase of the Israel captain Avi Cohen from Maccabi Tel Aviv. A year later Zahavi was involved in fixing the loan move by the then Manchester City midfielder Barry Silkman to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Zahavi&apos;s first major English deal in the big money era was, however, done as recently as June 1997, when Eyal Berkovic moved from Maccabi Haifa to West Ham United, then managed by Harry Redknapp, for \u00a31.75m. At West Ham Zahavi saw a young Rio Ferdinand strolling his way to prominence and Ferdinand became another, with Berkovic and later Yakubu, of the very few players Zahavi actually represents. Maccabi Haifa have been owned since 1992 by Ya&apos;akov Shahar, a businessman - he owns Mayer&apos;s Cars and Trucks, the largest vehicle importer in Israel - who is a childhood friend of Zahavi. After Shahar bought the club, Maccabi Haifa won five domestic championships and became the first Israeli side to play in the group stages of the European Champions League. That led to other Israeli clubs being taken over by businessmen, including Beitar Jerusalem by the Russian-Israeli Arcadi Gaydamak, a deal which Zahavi brokered. In 2003 Zahavi helped Roman Abramovich take over Chelsea, where Zahavi has been heavily involved ever since. Yakubu first made his name in his native Nigeria as a skilful, powerful striker, playing for Julius Berger FC, a Lagos club owned by a construction company of the same name. In 1999 he moved to Shahar&apos;s restlessly ambitious Maccabi Haifa for a reported $500,000 and there, still a teenager, he ploughed an international reputation. Silkman, now a Fifa-licensed agent, is understood to have been involved in spotting Yakubu and taking him to Haifa, and so Zahavi pays Silkman something from his fees whenever Yakubu moves. The striker&apos;s speed, skill and scoring record at Maccabi Haifa attracted international buyers, particularly during the club&apos;s 2002-03 run in the Champions League, and Zahavi acted as his agent when finally he moved to Portsmouth, now managed by Redknapp, in April 2003. Pompey paid the Israeli club a reported \u00a31.5m, agreeing also to share 50-50 any fee they later received from selling the striker. Yakubu made an instant impression at Portsmouth, helping the side to promotion in 2003, and his continued success in the Premiership made him a target for several clubs, including Newcastle and Aston Villa. Ultimately, though, neither club signed him in the January 2005 transfer window and Yakubu played out the season at Portsmouth. Then, in July 2005, Middlesbrough signed him for \u00a37.5m, also agreeing to pay Zahavi his \u00a33m commission if the player stays at the Riverside until 2010. At the time Redknapp had left Portsmouth and Milan Mandaric was still the club&apos;s owner. Five months later Zahavi was involved in introducing the \u00a310m takeover of the club by Alexandre Gaydamak, Arcady&apos;s son, who is also based partly in Israel. Redknapp had returned as Pompey&apos;s manager by then, and the club took on as their technical football director Abraham Grant, the former head coach of Maccabi Haifa. Before Yakubu moved to Middlesbrough some reports said Zahavi had gone to Israel to negotiate with Maccabi Haifa about the 50% sell-on clause, but this is understood not to have been so. In fact, the arrangement held when the deal went through, the Haifa club duly receiving half of the sale money. Zahavi was the only agent directly involved so his fee, payable by Middlesbrough, was both a payment from the club for successfully bringing the player and a commission for negotiating the terms of Yakubu&apos;s contract. Such lump sum payments by clubs to agents have been common practice in the Premier League, although the proposed new regulations, which the agents are opposing, will outlaw this and require players, not clubs, to pay agents. Zahavi himself was not prepared to talk about the Yakubu deal but he has always boldly defended his earnings as straightforward commissions, negotiated with and paid by willing clubs because he has successfully brought players to them or helped broker other deals. His influence in English football can be overstated - he is prominent at Chelsea and Portsmouth - but he is also busy elsewhere in Europe and South America. He advised MSI, which owns the registrations of the Argentinian players Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, when they moved to West Ham last year, then announced he was setting up an investment vehicle, the Hero Football Fund. The intention was to introduce to this country the South American practice of businessmen, not clubs, owning the registrations of players and reaping the profits when they move, but it is understood to be on hold now, pending the introduction of the new agents&apos; regulations, which may prohibit an agent being involved in such &quot;ownership&quot; of players. Zahavi was, however, willing to say that he disagreed strongly with the criticism, in Quest&apos;s report last month, of the 20 or so agents the company said &quot;acted together or in loose informal partnerships,&quot; paying each other on some transfer deals, &quot;without always disclosing this to the club or player.&quot; Quest said such practices &quot;exacerbated rumours&quot; that payments are being made &quot;in the shadows,&quot; and undermined transparency. Zahavi said the criticism was ridiculous. &quot;Working together happens everywhere. Co-operation is necessary to complete most deals. Agents work together, perhaps one brings the player, the other brings the club, then they share commissions. It is normal.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-01-17T01:18:03Z", "title": "David Conn: How Zahavi made contact sport an art form", "sentences": ["He first moved from sports writing into arranging player transfers in 1979, when he brokered Liverpool&apos;s \u00a3200,000 purchase of the Israel captain Avi Cohen from Maccabi Tel Aviv.", "A year later Zahavi was involved in fixing the loan move by the then Manchester City midfielder Barry Silkman to Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/17/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Lebanon", "Middle East timeline", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Five months after Israel\u2019s war in Lebanon, the battle has claimed its most senior scalp with the resignation of the Israeli chief of staff, General Dan Halutz. Although public protests about the handling of the war have faded in Israel, opinion polls continue to show widespread disillusionment with the government and the senior military leadership as a result of the 34-day fight with Hizbullah. Gen Halutz\u2019s surprise resignation came after several internal Israeli military inquiries into the conduct of the war but before the major investigation into the conflict, known as the Winograd Commission, delivers its interim findings, which are due in February or March. In his resignation letter Gen Halutz spoke of taking \u201cresponsibility\u201d but he pointedly admitted no failures or mistakes in the conduct of the war in Lebanon. In the letter, addressed to the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, he said: \u201cIn order to lead, we must carry out our responsibility. Therefore, after completing my mission for now, I wish to inform you that I plan to end my role as chief of staff immediately.\u201d Ze\u2019ev Schiff, Israel\u2019s most respected military analyst, said he was surprised by the timing of the resignation. \u201cMy feeling is that he wanted to dictate the way and date of his resignation and not to wait for others to do it for him,\u201d he said. He said Gen Halutz, an air force officer, had overseen an unprecedented process of review and internal inquiry since the war. There has been considerable debate in Israel about the summer conflict, and particularly the failure of the announced government policy to crush Hizbullah and to secure the release of two Israeli soldiers whose capture on July 12 triggered the war. There has been a long debate about the decision to use ground troops, who only moved in to southern Lebanon in large numbers towards the end of the conflict. The war claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese, including an unknown number of Hizbullah fighters, and 159 Israelis, of whom 39 were civilians. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that this was a real collapse or defeat,\u201d said Mr Schiff. \u201cIt is true there were problems but maybe easier problems that the Americans and the British are facing in Iraq ... It was a problem of strategy and the misunderstanding about how to achieve the objective.\u201d Gen Halutz will in the coming weeks give evidence to the Winograd Commission and as a civilian some believe he might be more likely to give revealing testimony about the discussions held between politicians and the military during the war. \u201cIt will be easier for him to answer certain questions,\u201d said Mr Schiff. But the focus will rapidly shift to the defence minister, Amir Peretz, and Mr Olmert, both of whom have also faced repeated public calls for their resignation and who both may face criticism when the commission reports. \u201cMy analysis is that many of the military mistakes were a direct result of the very problematic way that the objectives of the war and the general plan of the war were defined,\u201d said Shlomo Brom, a former chief of strategic planning in the Israeli military and now an academic at the Jaffee Centre in Tel Aviv University. \u201cThe problem was the interaction between the political and military leadership and the decisions that were taken as a result of that.\u201d Gen Brom said the commission could yet force the resignation of Mr Olmert: \u201cIf the report is very negative and attributes to him personal responsibility for different mistakes and management that I think he will have no alternative but to resign.\u201d The prime minister is also facing his own troubles. Just hours before Gen Halutz resigned, Israel\u2019s state prosecutor said it was beginning a criminal investigation into Mr Olmert over his involvement in the sale of a stake in an Israeli bank when he was finance minister. At least two other political cases involving Mr Olmert are being studied and may yet lead to more criminal investigations. Israeli prime ministers have been investigated while in office in the past without being charged with any crime, but many say that while Mr Olmert might survive the fallout of the Lebanon war, he may be brought down by political scandal. \u201cOlmert\u2019s problem is not the chief of staff,\u201d said Mr Schiff, the analyst. \u201cHis problem is the other investigations.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2007-01-17T12:44:03Z", "title": "Lebanon war claims its biggest scalp", "sentences": ["\u201cMy analysis is that many of the military mistakes were a direct result of the very problematic way that the objectives of the war and the general plan of the war were defined,\u201d said Shlomo Brom, a former chief of strategic planning in the Israeli military and now an academic at the Jaffee Centre in Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/17/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Bolton Wanderers"], "article": "Tal Ben Haim is one of those quietly efficient players casual spectators sometimes barely notice but the low-profile Israeli defender could be poised to alter the complexion of this season&apos;s Premiership. If, as widely expected, he swaps Bolton Wanderers for Chelsea, he will surely bolster Jose Mourinho&apos;s hopes of winning a third title and possibly deliver a blow to Sam Allardyce&apos;s European ambitions. Gordon McQueen is adamant Ben Haim could radically change the order of the Premiership&apos;s top six. &quot;He can help Chelsea win the title but, if he goes, Bolton will lose one of the main reasons why they&apos;ve been challenging for Europe,&quot; said the former Manchester United and Scotland defender. &quot;If Ben Haim&apos;s move goes through, all of a sudden, things could be different for both clubs. &quot;You won&apos;t see him pinging the ball around and attempting crowd-pleasing passes but he&apos;s a terrifically capable and versatile defender who is intelligent enough to play within his capabilities.&quot; Yet if he is not that hot when it comes to 40-yard passes, it would be unwise to underestimate Ben Haim&apos;s spoon-bending capacity. Intriguingly, the 24-year-old partly credits his metamorphosis from little-known Maccabi Tel Aviv stopper into John Terry&apos;s prospective new partner to the psychic Uri Geller, who counsels him in positive thinking. Ben Haim has refused to extend his contract beyond June and providing Bolton and Chelsea can conclude a deal for Ben Haim - probably in the region of \u00a31\u00bdm-\u00a33m - the Stamford Bridge air should be filled with conciliatory thoughts. But once on the field, Roman Abramovich&apos;s proposed peace offering to Mourinho is no agent of appeasement. &quot;If you were a striker you would not be over-keen on coming up against Ben Haim,&quot; said McQueen. &quot;You would definitely know about it afterwards. He&apos;s physically competitive and very good in the air but also has the brain to read the game very well. When you put those qualities together with his pace, it makes him difficult to criticise. &quot;He plays to his strengths and uses the ball safely and sensibly; he doesn&apos;t attempt fancy passes he might not be able to pull off. But one of Ben Haim&apos;s biggest advantages is his versatility. He looks equally comfortable at centre-half and right-back and I&apos;ve also seen him play effectively as a left-back; that ability to operate right across the back four could be invaluable to Chelsea.&quot; Moreover Any teething troubles in west London would presumably be swiftly assuaged by a chat with Geller. As Radhi Jaidi, a Bolton team-mate, recently revealed: &quot;Tal is a very positive person and I know he puts a lot of it down to his sessions with Uri Geller. Uri fills his mind with positive thinking.&quot; Geller, meanwhile, is not about to keep their association discreet and details his part in Ben Haim&apos;s career trajectory on his website: &quot;I have been proud to coach Tal with positive thinking sessions, using the power of his mind to bring his body to new heights of athleticism.&quot; Not that Ben Haim objects. &quot;Uri has helped me enormously,&quot; he enthused. &quot;He has persuaded me to believe both in myself and in other things that have helped my game with Bolton and Israel.&quot; Long fascinated by assorted branches of psychology, Allardyce has not discouraged this relationship but Bolton&apos;s manager is, nevertheless, the key mentor behind Ben Haim&apos;s rise from obscurity. Tipped off by Israeli contacts, he was alerted to Ben Haim&apos;s potential early in 2004. After being impressed during a brief trial, Allardyce signed him that July in a deal understood to be worth around \u00a3150,000. Having settled into a new country with minimal fuss, Ben Haim then made himself near indispensable. Tellingly, Bolton&apos;s manager regards him as so integral to his team&apos;s success that when Ben Haim flies off on international duty, Allardyce ensures that several crates of the special Penta mineral water drunk by everyone at the Reebok go with him. Penta claims to be an ultra-purified water and the &quot;cleanest&quot; available. Slightly underwhelmed by such attention to detail, the Israeli management expelled Ben Haim from a training camp in Slovenia last August after he refused to partake in a practice session but, rather than insubordination, this boycott is understood to have taken place on Allardyce&apos;s orders. Certainly bar one heated on-pitch row with his erstwhile team-mate Jay Jay Okocha and an incident where he collapsed rather too easily when shoved by Wayne Rooney, Israel&apos;s biggest football star since Eyal Berkovic has generally proved a model professional. Not to mention a defender Allardyce could do without losing. &quot;The lad has been one of the best players this club has had for many, many years,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Tal is a top talent.&quot; Israeli imports Tal Ben-Haim, Bolton Wanderers An influential presence at the heart of defence and an example of why Bolton have been able to compete in the top half of the Premiership.

Penguin \u00a38.99 Realising that most of his students were too young to remember even the end of the Cold War, Yale history professor John Lewis Gaddis set about writing an accessible account of the conflict that marked so much of the 20th century yet already appears to be a distant fantasy, with so many of its characteristics seeming anachronistic next to the stormclouds gathering over modern international relations. Gaddis has a great talent for liveliness and manages to present the labyrinthine history of the conflict between capitalism and communism in a manner at once densely informative and grippingly readable, so that even a reader to whom the Berlin Wall might as well have been made of Sticklebricks will be left in no doubt as to what all the fuss was about. Peggy Guggenheim: Mistress of Modernism, by Mary Dearborn. Virago \u00a39.99 Peggy Guggenheim was born into the &apos;poor&apos; branch of the Guggenheims, which left her only enough money to amass one of the most important collections of 20th-century art. Furthermore, her catalogue of lovers included the likes of Samuel Beckett, Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp. With gusto, Dearborn places Guggenheim as one of the most roaring practitioners of the roaring Twenties, flitting around Europe having booze- and rage-fuelled relationships, but also helping artists escape from the Nazis at considerable personal risk and being instrumental in establishing the careers of Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and the like. Gossipy and enjoyable, this account convincingly defends the much criticised Guggenheim&apos;s right to be racy, but is more haphazard on the less salacious aspects of her life. Not Buying It, by Judith Levine. Pocket Books \u00a37.99 Peeved beyond endurance by Christmas shopping madness, Judith Levine and her partner Paul vowed to buy nothing beyond necessities throughout 2004. Having reconciled her moral position on buying non-economy toilet paper and insulin for their diabetic cat, Levine gradually grows accustomed to forsaking retail therapy and cinema trips in favour of library books, mending the toaster and Paul&apos;s home brew. Though her experiment is rather less stringent than that of her self-sufficient friend, whose ambition is to live on the poverty line in the name of social justice, Levine&apos;s year not only saves her thousands of dollars but also stimulates a compelling and unpreachy examination of the evils of consumerism, the inequities of public spending in the US and the widening wealth gap.

In each film the participants appealed directly to the grandees at Davos to use their influence to move things on from the current destructive stalemate. The first response came from Mahmoud Abbas, president of Palestinian National Authority. In translation the speech was measured, if a touch heavy, formal and with only a glancing response to the films. Livni - her website records a few years working for Mossad as well as a law degree and two children - spoke simply, sympathetically and directly to the concerns of the young voices we&apos;d heard. She gave a quiet assessment of where things stood. It was human and decent stuff. And then the great charmer and showman himself. The organisers had been hoping for Olmert, but they got Shimon Peres. Is there anyone on the international stage who speaks English more beautifully? He may be 84. He may be the ultimate re-tread politician. English may be his second, or even third language.

They can be found all over the country in all age groups, although in general singles live in Tel Aviv, retired couples in Netanya and Ra&apos;anana, while younger couples prefer the new towns of Beit Shemesh and Modi&apos;in in the hills around Jerusalem. Britons generally come to play a part in the Jewish state, although few would deny that the seemingly endless summer and the mild, three-month winter are a major bonus. That said, the threat of instability and war is never far away, and migrant couples have to accept that their family - and their sons in compulsory military service - may be on the frontline. Ideologically, Britons are more likely to be found on the collective kibbutz than the religious settlement on the West Bank. Kfar Hanassi has the most concentrated group of Britons and native English speakers. In 1948, around 100 members of the Jewish scout movement in Britain settled on a rocky hill, to found an agricultural garrison to defend the border of the newly formed state of Israel against Syria, less than a mile away. Helen, 77, arrived in 1949 from London and met her future husband, Ivan, 81, on the train to the kibbutz. &quot;We were starry eyed. We were building a new country. I never cried so much as I did in that first year. I hated every minute of it, but I stayed because I had no option. But then we built our lives and now we have a real sense of achievement.&quot; Most kibbutzim received members from other countries, but Kfar Hanassi remained predominantly British. The kibbutz also had a different approach to the collectivist spirit of the movement: they introduced self-service in the dining room and allowed children to sleep at their parents&apos; home, rather than in the children&apos;s house. The kibbutz has a theatre, swimming pool, gym, a park named after Marks &amp; Spencer founder Edward Sieff and a communal car pool. Its public areas are landscaped and even its bomb shelters are disguised by rockeries. But the dreams of Zionism and communal living did not turn out as expected. The children of the kibbutz did not want to continue their parents&apos; experiment, and five years ago the kibbutz was privatised. Kfar Hanassi is also becoming overshadowed by its Arab neighbour, Tuba-Zangaria, which, with 6,000 people, is 10 times bigger. For all that, the kibbutzniks seem very proud of what they&apos;ve created - which is a home for a fresh generation of migrants. New houses are being built for private sale with the advertising slogan, &quot;Your Cup of Tea&quot;. How is it for you? Ian Whyatt, 37, from Hereford, has lived in Israel for 18 years.  I came as a kibbutz volunteer in 1989. I wasn&apos;t just looking for a good time - I was looking for a different way of life. I fell in love with the country, the people and the religion. Each time I returned to England, I wanted to get back to Israel. It was easy to convert because I already believed in God, so learning about Judaism was not difficult. After conversion, I changed my name to Ilan and did two years&apos; military service. I served in Gaza, around Khan Yunis and the Jewish settlements of Gush Katif. Afterwards I worked for a while as a security guard for El Al, but then I wanted to find a kibbutz. It was by chance that I ended up at Kfar Hanassi. I didn&apos;t know anything of the kibbutz&apos;s history and then I heard everyone speaking English in the dining room. I&apos;m fluent in Hebrew, but there&apos;s nothing like hearing your mother tongue and you have all the accents here, from Leeds to London. There are some things I miss about England, such as sincerity and politeness, and I get that here, as well as English products including Branston Pickle. I am now a landscape gardener. I was pruning an olive tree the other day and I was looking up through the branches at the sun and it hit me then that here I was, living in the Mediterranean. It really is like a dream come true. How to do it Emigration for Jews to Israel is relatively easy - but for non-Jews it can be very difficult. For Jews, there are agencies aplenty to help with the move and the search for a new job. For non-Jews, the only path to citizenship is conversion to Judaism which, officially, takes nine months of study or, unofficially, several thousand pounds. Once in Israel, new migrants go to &apos;ulpan&apos; to learn Hebrew, though as most Israelis speak English well, poor Hebrew is not a major obstacle to getting by. British migrants tend to be skilled professionals who may work in hi-tech industries or the professions but will have a similar standard of living to the one they left behind. Israel is the most industrially and economically developed country in the Middle East. Its exports include diamonds, high technology, military equipment, software, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and agricultural products.

Adding to a growing range of books on terrorism and bearing a highly provocative title, God&apos;s Terrorists is readable but one-sided. Allen&apos;s contention that the Wahhabis were to a large extent responsible for the uprising against British rule in India in 1857 is bound to raise eyebrows. He relies heavily on British accounts of Muslim militancy and engages in speculation when he&apos;s unable to supply evidence that anti-British rebels were in fact Wahhabis. This book not only fails to distinguish between &quot;religious fanatics&quot; and actual &quot;terrorists&quot;, it reduces anti-colonial struggle to an Islamist, terrorist enterprise, curtailing Indian and Afghan histories to fit in with a modern narrative of global jihad.

Taut, condensed and wonderfully satirical, De Zengotita&apos;s elucidation on all we take for granted is sharply self-aware, permeated by an array of social theories and interspersed with personal anecdotes: the story of the author and his method-acting classmates simulating grief at drama school, when they mistook the news that President Kennedy had been shot for an improvisation calling for them to &quot;be in the moment&quot;, is a perfect, excruciating example. Mediated is a splendid treatise on the ways in which reality and representation have fused into a field of options, transforming our sense of self into a series of performances. De Zengotita is very conscious of vast populations trapped in realities so restrictive and desperate that the possibility of applying what he has to say does not arise at all, but for those of us living in the &quot;overdeveloped&quot; world, this book is essential. AS Peggy Guggenheim: Mistress of Modernism, by Mary Dearborn (Virago, \u00a39.99) Peggy Guggenheim began life as a modest heiress with low self-esteem (she hated her big nose), but ended it as one of America&apos;s leading modern art impresarios. This compelling biography reveals how she escaped from a bourgeois but &quot;strangely sexualised&quot; German-Jewish household to befriend and support avant-garde artists. Peggy became famous for her &quot;hoaring&quot; (as she called it), and even managed to get the sexually lackadaisical Samuel Beckett into bed. Her husbands were generally unpleasant: the first a violent drunk; her last, the artist Max Ernst, barely acknowledged her presence. The alcoholic novelist Djuna Barnes was a lifelong friend, although Dearborn recounts one curious night when Djuna proceeded to &quot;pound&quot; Peggy &quot;in the bottom&quot;, causing her to cry out, &quot;My God, how this woman hates me!&quot; Guided in her art acquisitions by the ingenious Marcel Duchamp, Peggy played a substantial role in the history of modernism and abstract expressionism (she claimed to have discovered Jackson Pollock). &quot;My fucking is only a sideshow,&quot; she once informed a friend. &quot;My work comes first every time.&quot;Ian Pindar City of Oranges: Arabs and Jews in Jaffa, by Adam LeBor (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99) In this even-handed history of Jaffa, LeBor covers in detail the political machinations and numerous riots that led up to the Palestinian nakba (&quot;catastrophe&quot;) in 1948. He recounts the experiences of Arab families who became refugees, then exiles, and also talks to those who stayed behind, becoming &quot;Arab Israelis&quot;. The legend of Jaffa is that it is a special place where Jews and Arabs peacefully co-exist, but LeBor discovers &quot;two self-contained narratives of national and personal history, and that each passes the other by, without even meeting&quot;. Jaffa officially ceased to exist in 1950 when Tel Aviv, which began as a suburb of Jaffa, assumed pre-eminence. Ancient citrus groves were destroyed to provide land for more Bauhaus-inspired tower blocks. LeBor also interviews Jewish families who filled the vacuum left by the Palestinian exodus. Frank Meisler, whose parents died at Auschwitz, started a new life in the heart of the old city. &quot;The Arabs have a case,&quot; Meisler admits. &quot;Just as I didn&apos;t understand the gravity of what was happening when I said goodbye to my parents in 1939, I didn&apos;t understand the implications when I arrived in Jaffa.&quot;IP Nomad&apos;s Hotel: Travels in Time and Space, by Cees Nooteboom, translated by Ann Kelland (Vintage, \u00a37.99) Published between 1971 and 2002, these essays are the work of a Dutch novelist and poet who has reflected absorbingly on the nature of travel, seeing in it a fundamental paradox: &quot;You journey alone in a world which is controlled by others&quot;. His impulse to wander &quot;has to do with learning and contemplation, with curiosity and perplexity&quot;, but hassles and people - officials, hotel and airport staff, other passengers - keep interrupting his learned musings, creating the comic friction that informs his most engaging pieces. Hence it&apos;s the 70s journeys to Mali, Morocco, Gambia and Iran which work best here, with adventures and encounters en route bringing out a talent for self-mockery, and Nooteboom rising admirably to the challenge of covering politics. When visiting European cities, in contrast, he talks to no one - though often accompanied by photographers, he never uses them as a foil - and nothing happens; so his tendency towards rarefied soliloquy goes unchecked. Though written later than the African articles, his portraits of Munich, Venice and Zurich seem far more old-fashioned.John Dugdale", "publicationDate": "2007-01-27T23:53:50Z", "title": "Non-fiction: Jan 27", "sentences": ["Jaffa officially ceased to exist in 1950 when Tel Aviv, which began as a suburb of Jaffa, assumed pre-eminence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview15"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "It was Trevor Howard who introduced me to the delights of table football. We were staying in the magnificently shambolic Galle Face hotel in Colombo when Trevor came across a table in the corner of a disused ballroom. So it was that we spent a merry week, spinning and drinking and generally having a high old time of it. I think it was Bob Mitchum who remarked: &apos;You&apos;ll never catch Trevor Howard acting.&apos; How very true, and it was also quite a struggle to catch him sober. For as dear old TH often said: &apos;I drink because it makes the world a nicer place.&apos; A dictum, that if applied to Chelsea Football Club, suggests there has been an outbreak of teetotalism down the King&apos;s Road. How nasty have the champions become now they are losing their grip on the trophy? Many theories as to the reasons for this have been expounded in rival newspapers, none of them satisfactory. It therefore gives me great pleasure, having talked to friends of all involved, to give you, on the QT, the lowdown on what is really happening at The Bridge of Lies. First, a Palestinian friend of Roman Abramovich informs me that the White Russian is tired of life, London and watching Salomon Kalou. The children are struggling to understand the whys and wherefores of the English public-school system and no amount of tutoring can explain it. Expect the Abramoviches to move lock, stock and oil barrel to Tel Aviv in the near future. Second, a Kiwi friend of Jose Mourinho whispers in my ear that Special J is in the midst of a truly harrowing midlife crisis and is irritated that his wife is having tea in Harvey Nick&apos;s a lot with, of all people, Arsene Wenger. This has dented his confidence to such an extent that he has been reduced to seeking out Paulo Ferreira for man-to-man advice. Third, a man I happened to meet in the local hardware shop, who is a cousin of the best man at Steve Clarke&apos;s uncle&apos;s wedding, is adamant that the Scotchman still hankers after the Dumbarton job. Fourth, Russell Brand&apos;s agent is confident that Frank Lampard will follow David Beckham to America. According to the 20-per-center, the midfielder is as upset by large swathes of the population calling him Fat Frank as he is by the tiny slither of the population who claim to have actually finished his book, and has taken his wife&apos;s advice that now might be a good moment to try to &apos;reinvent himself across the pond&apos;. So there you have it. If what my sources say is correct, and they have been as historically consistent as they are geographically varied, then Chelsea are in meltdown and Ken Bates is hovering waiting to pick up the pieces once they have cooled. If Abramovich is forced into a quick sale then Ken will be only too happy to pick up the club again for a \u00a31 (plus debts). Once re-ensconced he will shed the deadwood and instigate a system of priorities.

Two Palestinian militant groups, Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, said they had carried out the attack. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said his security forces would &quot;continue their ongoing and never-ending struggle against terrorists and those who send them&quot;. However, the defence minister, Amir Peretz, called the suicide bombing an &quot;escalation&quot; and said it threatened a recent ceasefire with Palestinian groups. He promised to take all &quot;necessary&quot; steps to prevent similar attacks. Fatah, the party of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the bombing. However, the more radical Hamas group - which controls the Palestinian parliament - described it as a &quot;natural response&quot; to Israeli policies. &quot;So long as there is occupation, resistance is legitimate,&quot; a spokesman for the organisation said. The last suicide bombing in Israel before today happened in April, when a bomber struck at a Tel Aviv restaurant, killing 12 people. Suicide bombings in Israel are sharply down from their peak, four years ago, when hundreds of people were killed in dozens of attacks. A resurgence of bombings could derail efforts to restart stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian authorities, the US warned. &quot;Failure to act against terror will inevitably affect relations between that government and the international community and undermine the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own,&quot; Tony Snow, a White House spokesman, said. Police in Eilat, a popular destination for both Israeli and foreign tourists, which has never before been targeted by a suicide attacker, said initially they believed the blast had been either a gas explosion or the result of crime. But it was confirmed later that a bomber, believed to have been wearing an explosives belt, had killed himself and three other people at the bakery. &quot;I saw a man with a black coat and a bag,&quot; a local resident told Israel Radio. &quot;For Eilat, where it is hot, it is strange to see someone walking with a coat. &quot;I said to myself: &apos;Why is this idiot dressed that way?&apos; Seconds later, I heard a huge blast. The building shook.&quot; An Islamic Jihad website said the attack was intended to help bring an end to the continuing fighting between Fatah and Hamas, which erupted in December. &quot;The operation has a clear message to the Palestinian rivals: it is necessary to end the infighting and point the guns toward the occupation that has hurt the Palestinian people,&quot; a message on the site said. The group named the bomber as 21-year-old Mohammed Saksak, of Gaza City, who it said had entered Israel from Jordan after seven months of preparation for the attack. &quot;We held back on operations for a while and gave the stage to Fatah and Hamas to conduct unity government discussions. We saw that it has not achieved anything, so we have reverted to martyrdom operations,&quot; an Islamic Jihad spokesman said. The Hamas reaction to the bombing is likely to further isolate the organisation, which is viewed by the EU and US as a terrorist organisation. Foreign funding to the Hamas government has been cut off since it won elections a year ago. Fighters from Fatah and Hamas battled each other in the Gaza Strip earlier today, killing two people and plunging large areas of Gaza City into darkness after an electrical substation was knocked out. Several people were kidnapped, including the young son and nephew of the head of the Abbas-allied Preventive Security Service. The kidnappers threatened to kill the boys within three hours unless Hamas fighters seized by Fatah-allied security forces were released. The violence was some of the most serious in recent weeks, sparking renewed fears that the volatile situation could spiral into full-blown civil war. Increased fighting was sparked when Mr Abbas threatened to call new elections in December - a move denounced by Hamas as an effective coup attempt. Hamas and Fatah have held weeks of fruitless talks about cooperating in a unity government, and both Saudi Arabia and Egypt have offered to mediate between the sides.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-29T18:04:48Z", "title": "Suicide blast kills four in Eilat", "sentences": ["The last suicide bombing in Israel before today happened in April, when a bomber struck at a Tel Aviv restaurant, killing 12 people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/29/israel1"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Military and political victory in the Middle East has arrived at a new definition. It no longer requires conventional all out success but simply survival at the end of the aggression or alternatively, preventing the opposition from achieving their goal. Last summer, Hizbullah celebrated &quot;success&quot; against Israel despite the devastation of southern Lebanon simply because they did not allow Israel to achieve its goal. For Israel, this was a defeat despite their superior army and airpower because Hizbullah as an organisation still existed. Similarly, Hamas is celebrating the victory of one year in power, not because of any economic, educational or health sector successes but because they managed to defy Israel and its allies. One year on, they are still a part of the Palestinian government. In the past year, Palestinians have experienced complete political isolation; faced starvation in Gaza with the closure of its borders; witnessed civil strife due to the economic blockade; fought off western and Israeli interference over governance; and now must regulate and restrain the factional violence that has erupted between Fatah and Hamas supporters and even officials, engineered by Washington and Tel Aviv. In any other democracy, these odds would have ensured a complete breakdown in the government. For Palestinians, resilience has meant their very survival and so they trudge on in the hope of brighter days to come. The stalemate between Hamas and Fatah should have been resolved by the formation of a unity government. However, while the talks have persisted for months, US meddling seems designed to defeat this objective. Israel refuses to talk to Hamas, and the guardian US is facilitating a situation where it will not need to. With Mahmoud Abbas receiving the red carpet treatment and millions in aid for &quot;presidential security&quot;, the US is manipulating the power base in Palestine. The stick wielded over the Palestinians for decades has been more savagely used since Hamas came to power. Now that the population is on the brink of starvation, the carrot is being dangled in order to bribe them away from supporting Hamas by the very powers that have orchestrated its starvation. It is difficult to contemplate what a father would do, when the choices are between basic food on the table for his family or retaining the freedom to exercise his democratic rights. Yet that is exactly the stark choice that the calculated manipulative strategy of Israel and the US has presented many Palestinians with - abandon Hamas and we will to come to your aide. Despite all the pressures, Hamas has retained its grass roots popularity, which reinforces the Palestinian wish to liberate their land, even if need be, through military means. To understand this, one need look no further than Palestinian experiences of past peace negotiations, where their leaders of yesteryears compromised and made deals with Israel conceding the very core of Palestinian claims to their homeland, and yet witnessed no ease in the occupation in return. With each year, there are more, not less checkpoints. Incursions are reportedly becoming more violent; weapons employed against Palestinians more sophisticated, and occupation forces more ruthless. In the eyes of the Palestinians, international complicity in the occupation gives Israel the green light to continue with all this unabated. Hamas has held true to its core beliefs while it has been in power and as a result, in the eyes of many Palestinians it has become a symbol beyond its political existence and something they will defend. As the House of Commons, International Development Committee report January 2007 acknowledges that isolating Hamas is counterproductive and unsustainable. Hamas has become the backbone of Palestinian resistance and survival against a brutal and heavily armed occupier and at an international level, despite castigation as a terrorist organisation; it is hailed as a resistance movement against modern day colonialist oppression. Their victory in surviving a full one year against the forces of the superpower of the day and its allies speaks volumes of its resilience and determination. Whether Hamas remains in power or not, one thing is for certain - its central political role in liberating Palestine is here to stay and it would thus be more prudent of the European Union and the US to accept the will of the Palestinian people and demand Israel talk to Hamas.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-01T09:30:00Z", "title": "Talking it over", "sentences": ["In the past year, Palestinians have experienced complete political isolation; faced starvation in Gaza with the closure of its borders; witnessed civil strife due to the economic blockade; fought off western and Israeli interference over governance; and now must regulate and restrain the factional violence that has erupted between Fatah and Hamas supporters and even officials, engineered by Washington and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/01/celebratingavictory"}, {"tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Football", "Media", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "In a world of exhaustive sports trivia coverage, it seems a testament to the endless richness of the seam - certainly the endless flightiness of Her Majesty&apos;s press - that three reports in the past week could contrive to leave readers with more questions than answers. The first concerns rapidly tarnishing Teddy Sheringham trophy Danielle Lloyd, who has emerged from the Celebrity Big Brother house to speculation that her career as a beauty queen is effectively finished. Whether or not one regards this verdict as premature (personally I think she&apos;d still trounce Eugene Terreblanche in the swimwear round), the Sun&apos;s brief declaration that she is &quot;locked in crunch talks&quot; with Teddy about the future of the relationship is tantalising in the extreme. More mesmeric still are the conflicting reports stating that Sheringham has &quot;packed her bags himself&quot;, conjuring mental images of Teddy dutifully folding 437 vests emblazoned with variations on the word &quot;babe&quot;, before encasing them in bin bags and leaving them on the drive. Elsewhere, many were perplexed by Nicola T, Page 3 girl and participant in ITV2&apos;s apocalypse-presaging show Wags Boutique, which began this week (book your Anderson Shelter now). During promotional interviews, Nicola announced that her boyfriend Bobby Zamora - who moonlights as a team-mate of Teddy&apos;s at West Ham United - has installed a vast photograph of her breasts above the couple&apos;s bed. Were Nicola engaged in the kind of work that would take her out of town for long periods - trucking perhaps, or Mayan archaeology - the Last Supper-proportioned image would serve as a useful aide memoire for the lonely striker. However, given that she goes on to state her insistence upon being home every night to give Zamora full access to the genuine article (I paraphrase slightly) immediately below the mural, its presence seems almost as baffling as the Sun&apos;s fastidious practice of asterisking out the middle i in the word t*t, when the actual body part can often be viewed on the same page. Yet even in such a strong field of conundrums, one revelation stands out as more elliptic than all others. You are cordially directed to a small Independent report detailing the presence of Steve McClaren in the House of Commons gallery last week, watching Tony Blair phone in his Prime Minister&apos;s Questions performance. The FA cite &quot;general curiosity&quot; as Steve&apos;s motivation, but according to other sources the England manager is keen to study the PM&apos;s techniques for dealing with aggressive questioning, and last week&apos;s visit had been preceded by a trip to Chequers, where the two gentlemen joked about never reading the papers. This we knew - who can forget McClaren&apos;s assertion that he had not read a Terry Venables column which directly contradicted his explanation for the 3-5-2 shambles in Zagreb? - though whether he and the PM also shared a laugh about disloyally ambitious colleagues is, alas, not a subject on which Soho Square wishes to be drawn. Perhaps we should be encouraged to see Steve taking advantage of the free lessons in crisis management offered by the PM, as opposed to paying for the same from the likes of his erstwhile, no less likeable, guru, Max Clifford. On the other hand, anyone who has ever watched a McClaren press conference and thought &quot;Who&apos;s working this guy? His lips hardly move&quot; may question whether the England manager modelling his media performance on arguably the only public figure with a more unsettling grin than his is really the optimum result for England fans. Last week, for instance, saw the PM&apos;s idiosyncratic approach to &quot;taking responsibility&quot; in full flight, with much of PMQs devoted to wondering why Mr Blair would choose to duck out of the subsequent debate on Iraq to attend a CBI conference. Would a similar scheduling clash get Steve out of the post-match press conference should England have one of their off days against Spain next week, or worse, in Tel Aviv next month? Only time will show. But keep an eye out for McClaren&apos;s first tryout of one of those trademark self-deprecating jokes the electorate likes - maybe &quot;likes&quot; is the wrong word, &quot;expects&quot; certainly - Blair to offer after every &quot;setback&quot;.

Ramon, who resigned from his post in August after he was charged, will be sentenced this month at Tel Aviv magistrates court and faces up to three years in jail. It is one of several high-profile cases to have damaged the reputation of the government. The attorney general has said he has enough evidence to charge the president, Moshe Katsav, with rape and other sexual offences, and another high-profile politician, Tzahi Hanegbi, has been charged with fraud, bribery and perjury. Ramon, 56, a senior figure in the Kadima party and a close ally of the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, held his head in his hands as the verdict, a unanimous decision by three judges, was read to the court. &quot;There are some lines that cannot be crossed,&quot; said Judge Hayuta Kochan. &quot;This was not a kiss of affection. This has all the elements of sexual crime.&quot; The judge said the female soldier had suffered a &quot;traumatic experience&quot;. Ramon claimed the kiss, which happened at a defence ministry party on the first day of the war against Hizbullah last summer, was consensual, and that the soldier, 21, had been flirting with him. Yesterday&apos;s conviction ends his political career and was apparently not expected by some in government, who were reportedly hoping to reinstate him as justice minister within hours of an acquittal. Mr Olmert is expected to reshuffle his coalition cabinet to find a permanent replacement in the justice ministry and to shore up his position. The prime minister, the subject of another criminal investigation, is struggling in opinion polls and could face further criticism over his handling of the war in Lebanon last summer. He may give a second cabinet seat to the hawkish Yisrael Beiteinu party led by Avigdor Lieberman, now a deputy prime minister, who has called for Israel&apos;s borders to be redrawn to exclude hundreds of thousands of Arab citizens. Political analysts say the reshuffle is unlikely to mean the replacement of the embattled defence minister, Amir Peretz. He is also faring badly in polls and is expected to lose his position as head of the Labour party, the junior partner in the coalition government, in internal elections this spring. In a separate development, it emerged yesterday the Israeli government may move part of the West Bank barrier deeper into Palestinian territory to surround two more settlements near Modiin Ilit, north of Jerusalem. If the barrier&apos;s route is altered to include Naaleh and Nili, where 1,500 Israelis live, it would leave some 20,000 Palestinians caught between the wall and the 1967 boundary with Israel.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-01T23:54:54Z", "title": "Israel's former minister guilty of sexual misconduct", "sentences": ["Ramon, who resigned from his post in August after he was charged, will be sentenced this month at Tel Aviv magistrates court and faces up to three years in jail."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/01/israelandthepalestinians.middleeasttimeline"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Following my raft of exclusives last week, it was no surprise when I was roused from my slumbers early on Sunday morning by, of all things, the telephone. Strangely, it was not Murdoch offering me Coulson&apos;s job at the News of the World or Wade&apos;s at the Sun, but a Russian man, seemingly speaking through a handkerchief, inviting me or, rather more accurately, insisting, that I hotfoot my way to Haifa. I have always been a fan of late January sunshine, so little persuasion was needed. Sadly, my sojourn turned out to be less holiday and more short, sharp shock as, instead of twisting by the pool discussing literature, I found myself incarcerated in a travel lodge on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, being talked down to on geopolitics. Apparently, and forgive me for my necessary vagueness, but I have no wish to be Litvinenko&apos;d, my Palestinian friend of Abramovich was bang on the money. The Roman has flown and is highly unlikely to be lured back by Charlton (a). My mistake and, in fairness to myself, that of many of my colleagues was to think that his purchase of Chelsea FC had anything to do with football. The man can&apos;t stand the game. He has to be alerted by security guards through his earpiece as to when to smile, clap or scowl. The muppet&apos;s a puppet. It follows, therefore, that his little tournament in Israel had nothing to do with football and everything to do with strengthening relations between Russia and Israel. Not having my own key, I didn&apos;t get out much but, to judge from the waiters providing room service, there are a hell of a lot of twitchy people in Tel Aviv at the moment. Who can blame them? As it continues to go tits up for Uncle Sam in Iraq, there is a very real possibility that America will withdraw from the region. Wither Israel, then? Good question, Geoffrey. My hunch is that a combined Israeli- Russian force will invade Iran before the end of the decade. You read it here in Observer Sport first. The trip wasn&apos;t entirely wasted, for I had the good fortune to bump into Marcello Lippi in duty free on the way home. &apos;If anyone thinks that a move to a big English club is beyond me, Geoffrey,&apos; he said after sidling up to me. &apos; then I&apos;d just say, &quot; Give me a break.&quot;&apos; And the strange thing, given that he is native Italian, was that this was all carried off in a very passable John Virgo impersonation. He will make a most entertaining successor to Mourinho. Finally, what are we going to do with the dear old FA Cup? My peer group have suggested a little light draw-tampering but once again, having grasped the issue, they have failed to run sufficiently far with it. If it needs fixing, go for broke. I would immediately introduce a handicapping system. Every team would be assessed by those scientists whom statistician Daniel Finkelstein uses to fill his Fink Tank column in The Times and given a handicap between -3 and +3 goals.

Having cut David Beckham from the England squad in perpetuity at the start of this season, Steve McClaren has now lopped Paul Robinson from this evening&apos;s friendly with Spain. Purely footballing motives are married to a desire to excise any complacency. Ben Foster makes his debut between the posts tonight because Chris Kirkland has hurt a shoulder, and he will be there for the entire 90 minutes since McClaren intends to use his six substitutions to inspect outfield resources. The manager stopped short of promising that Robinson will start the Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel next month, even if he did describe him as the &quot;first-choice goalkeeper&quot;. Such status is evidently open to review. Other alterations have been forced on McClaren. Shaun Wright-Phillips will be on the right wing because a stomach upset rules out Aaron Lennon. Wayne Rooney will not be risked because of a back injury, with Peter Crouch the beneficiary. Following the withdrawal of Wayne Bridge, Phil Neville is preferred to Gareth Barry at left-back. It is the decision over the goalkeepers that intrigues. &quot;I haven&apos;t left out Paul Robinson,&quot; the manager stated tendentiously. &quot;It&apos;s a case of including Ben Foster. He needs a chance. None of our younger goalkeepers - Chris Kirkland, Scott Carson and Foster - have got the experience at international or even European level that Paul Robinson has got. Paul understands that.&quot; That could have been taken as sensible planning if he had gone on to confirm that Robinson will be reinstated in Tel Aviv. &quot;How can I name my team against Israel?&quot; McClaren said evasively. Robinson would have been disturbed by that answer. The goalkeeper&apos;s confidence seems to have fallen off the graph. He merely touched Ronaldo&apos;s cross into the path of Paul Scholes for Manchester United&apos;s third goal on Sunday. His judgment was awry, too, when he burst out towards Justin Hoyte in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final. The Arsenal right-back squared to leave Julio Baptista with an open goal for the equaliser in the 2-2 draw. While McClaren exonerated Robinson for the goals conceded with England this season and pointed to the fact that, ahead of the 2-0 defeat by Croatia, he had been on course to equal Gordon Banks&apos; record of seven consecutive clean sheets. Statistics, though, need not have stopped him from worrying about the goalkeeper. The manager is eager to increase competition. &quot;Ever since the World Cup and the disappointment of that, ever since my appointment, we&apos;ve all got something to prove,&quot; McClaren agreed. &quot;That&apos;s myself, that&apos;s the players. I do see it as a big year. We start with a friendly and hopefully finish it with qualification. We&apos;re not concentrating on whether it&apos;s a make-or-break year for me personally. That&apos;s irrelevant.&quot; Some freshness comes from reaching into the past. Kieron Dyer returns along with Jonathan Woodgate, selected because of England&apos;s refusal to use John Terry so soon after back surgery.

African-Americans call this kind of thing soul food for a reason; the feeding of the body is a by-product of its central purpose, to reconnect us with our roots. I was just starting on the second half of my sandwich when one of the signatories of Independent Jewish Voices came in, with his brother and Israeli sister-in-law. We didn&apos;t talk about politics at all, we talked about restaurants in Tel Aviv (&quot; ... and have you had the lobster at Mul Yam?&quot;). The signatory and I live round the corner from each other and he doesn&apos;t drive either so we walked down to the cab rank outside the tube station and shared a taxi. He had grown up in the neighbourhood, this was his territory. He was reminiscing about life here in the 1950s and 1960s, he showed me how much it had changed, how few shops from the old days remained. Blooms itself had moved to Golders Green from its original East End location. &quot;It&apos;s all much more Israeli now,&quot; he said. Indeed Blooms is now the only restaurant serving Ashkenazi food; there&apos;s only one similar establishment in Tel Aviv and Finks, the famous Jerusalem politicians&apos; and journalists&apos; dining and watering hole closed its doors a couple of years ago. Blooms is flanked by Solly&apos;s and Dizengoff, serving the lighter Sephardi dishes which are ubiquitous in Israel. It&apos;s easier to order a bowl of clam chowder in Israel than it is to find a menu serving chopped herring. Not only is Golders Green more Israeli - so is British Jewish life. Many, if not most British Jews have relatives in Israel. Many Jewish teenagers go on a gap year or gap summer to the country, through local synagogues or youth groups and the Israeli restaurants of Golders Green are staffed by young Israelis on their own gap year. British Jews return to Britain with Israeli girlfriends or boyfriends. Sometimes they don&apos;t return at all. In Israel last year I met a whole crowd of young British Jews who had recently made aliyah, including Seth Freedman and Alex Stein, whom I introduced to Georgina Henry for the first-hand experience they brought to Cif&apos;s coverage of Israel and the occupation. The most active Jewish voluntary group in Britain is the Women&apos;s International Zionist Organisation, founded in 1918 (the first year of the British Mandate) by Lady Seiff, wife of one of the co-founders of Marks and Spencer. For nearly 90 years, WIZO has been doing anti-poverty work with the women and children of first Palestine, then Israel. Latterly it has been involved in setting up rape crisis centres and battered wives&apos; shelters. It works also with Palestinian-Israelis and does not work in the settlements. With (again) first-hand experience of life in Israel amongst the very poor, it is the Jewish women of Britain&apos;s suburbs who are fiercely opinionated about the direction in which Israel is headed. I know these women. There is no knee-jerk support for the policies of the Israeli government. &quot;Why,&quot; one member asked me a couple of years ago, &quot;is Ariel Sharon sending Jewish boys to the territories to become murderers?&quot; There is another large, silent body of Jewish opinion which is doctrinally divided on Israel and Zionism: the Charedi or Orthodox, some of whom (the Chabad) are supporters of the Greater Israel movement and others (the Satmar) who are non-Zionists and believe that Israel can only be re-established with the coming of the Moshiach (messiah). Among them, is a tiny, publicity-seeking fringe, the Naturei Karta, which recently attended the Holocaust denial conference in Iran and have been threatened with a cherem, a form of excommunication, by the rest of the non-Zionist orthodox movement, not because of their views on Zionism but because of their cosying up to those whom the anti-Zionist Satmar nontheless consider &apos;the enemies of the Jews.&apos;. The reason I see myself somewhere in between the Independent Jewish Voices and the ones delineated as the Establishment, is that eight years ago I wrote a book about my mother&apos;s dementia, and about the role of memory in Jewish family life, and the care given to her by the voluntary bodies of the Jewish community. I had spent every Sunday afternoon for years visiting the care home where my mother was placed. We were all down in the same place: visiting loved ones whose minds and bodies were failing. Without the help and support of those mainstream bodies, affiliated to the Board of Deputies, I&apos;d have gone mad. Nothing I had written or read in the Guardian could help me now. It was the Jewish community which cared for my mother, the Jewish community which washed her body when she died and placed her in her coffin, it was the Jewish community who buried her and the synagogue which said the prayers, all in accordance with her wishes. It was the Jewish community I was forced to listen to, to hear their fears, hopes, beliefs, anxieties. Yesterday, the dismissive consensus among those not currently open to the ideas expressed in the IJV manifesto, was that its signatories wished to disassociate themselves from the mainstream of Jewish life and its embarrassing adherence to Zionism, in an intellectual and political climate in which universal values are more important than grubby nationalism. This was not the opening of a debate, but an act of unlateral disengagement, it was claimed. I know many of the signatories of Independent Jewish Voices, some of them are good friends. Like me, they are mainly secular, intellectual, only a telephone call away from getting an op-ed piece into the Guardian. But the majority of British Jews are not secular, not intellectual and have no access to the media, let alone the Guardian. Who would publish a public declaration by Britain&apos;s Jewish taxi-drivers, accountants, GPs, estate agents and pharmacists, without a single Mike Leigh or a Stephen Fry? I can&apos;t speak for the intentions of IJV, but if their collective membership wants to have any impact on the majority of the non-Guardian reading British Jews, they need to take the conversation to the places where Jews are: in their synagogues, at their youth groups, in their voluntary organisations. They need to acknowledge the central role that Israel plays in contemporary Jewish life, how it is now part and parcel of Jewish identity. IJV focuses on the controlling influence of the Jewish establishment, the chief rabbi&apos;s office and the Board of Deputies, but these bodies do not dictate Jewish views on Israel, for good or ill, they merely reflect them. When suicide bombers blow themselves up in Netanya, British Jews are not debating whether, if they lived under occupation, they would do the same themselves, they are on the phone to friends and family in Israel to make sure they were not among its victims. Israel, to them, is not a theory, a notional doctrine that can be reshaped in accordance with ideology. It&apos;s a place inhabited by real people - their own flesh and blood. And on that solid ground is where the necessary debate about its future needs to happen too.

Welcome to the latest installment of the Steve McClaren show. Some questions: 1) Would you have believed me if I&apos;d told you a few months ago that Ben Foster, Jonathan Woodgate, Phil Neville, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Kieron Dyer were all going to start a match for England? 2) In fact, do you believe me now? 3) Will Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso indulge in a bit of argy-bargy? 4) Who will win the duel between Fab Cesc and Fat Frank? 5) Why do England only ever play at Old Trafford these days? Did they just get bored of playing at venues like Portman Road and St Mary&apos;s? 6) Will England put in a totally inept performance like the ones in Croatia last year and Spain the year before, or an average performance like the one in Holland in November? Or, dare I say it, a good performance? 7) Why can&apos;t England friendlies ever be like this? Teams England Foster, Gary Neville, Ferdinand, Woodgate, Phil Neville, Wright-Phillips, Gerrard, Carrick, Lampard, Dyer, Crouch. Subs Robinson, Barry, Richards, Carragher, Terry, Dawson, Barton, Parker, Downing, Defoe. Spain Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Puyol, Pablo, Capdevila, Angulo, Xavi, Albelda, Silva, Villa, Morientes. Subs Reina, Javi Navarro, Antonio Lopez, Torres, Alonso, Iniesta, Arizmendi, Fabregas, Angel. Referee Michael Weiner (Germany) So that&apos;s questions three and four dealt with - Xabi Alonso and Cesc Fabregas have been left out by Aragones. They&apos;ve still got enough players on the pitch capable of running rings around England though. England are playing &quot;sort of 4-4-2, sort of 4-3-3, quite dynamic&quot;, according to their inspirational manager. Good to see he&apos;s spent the last few days ensuring the players are all aware of the intricate details of their jobs. Pre-match emails &quot;I&apos;ve been busy writing my BA dissertation on football violence, but every now and then it does a student good to just chill out and say it: Peter Crouch really is quite handsome,&quot; says Julia Kite, who really does need to get out of her Columbia University library more often. &quot;Laugh all you want, but he has a lovely bone structure and a nice smile.&quot; &quot;I have a theory on Steve McClaren,&quot; says Sandip Randhawa. &quot;He probably told the lads &apos;Right, if we play horribly, but just about qualify for the Euro, then everyone will write us off. At which point we will confuse everyone by playing good football and win the tournament.&apos; By adding Phillips to the starting line-up, this only adds to my belief he is trying to pull a fast one over everyone.&quot; If you were watching the BBC&apos;s coverage, the &quot;expert&quot; pundits would have already told you 67 times that there should be a Wright attached to that Phillips. &quot;Is Ben Foster the real deal or the next Nicky Weaver/Richard Wright?&quot; asks Rob Hisnay. He&apos;ll be the England and Man Utd No1 for the next 10 years. &quot;Please Mike, just tell us. Where can we listen to LIVE commentary, please?&quot; asks Nick Wootton-Jones, trying to take away six of my nine readers. &quot;Why the big secret ... why is this so hard to organise?&quot; &quot;All of the people I&apos;ve spoken to about the match recently are all declaring their undying (well, undying until about 11pm tonight) love for England,&quot; says Tom Coulton in Barcelona. &quot;Well, they say they love England and want us to win, but really it&apos;s just a case of the Welsh-esque mentality of &apos;We only support two teams, Barcelona and whoever Spain is playing&apos;.&quot; &quot;England last played on the 15th of November and will next turn out on the 24th of March,&quot; observes Gary Naylor. &quot;Amidst the furore over the appointment of a part-time coach for the &apos;Kids&apos;, can anyone tell me what full-time Steve does to earn his money?&quot; I think he does some advertising work for Colgate. Prediction A fairly dull 1-1 draw. Clever BBC ploy Flash up a graphic with an absent England team for this evening. It&apos;s ruined by the fact they have Ashley Cole at right-back. 1 min Excellent start from England. Or rather, dreadful start from Spain. Gerrard attracted the whole defence to him on the edge of the box, Puyol leaving Dyer completely free. His cross is weak and cleared though. &quot;My prediction is that both countries will be touted as potential winners of the 2010 World Cup, before going out in the quarter-finals,&quot; says Gary Naylor. 2 mins The man who&apos;s scored three goals in the last three seasons, Carrick, hits a rasper straight at Casillas. The luckiest keeper in the world unnecessarily fists it straight to Dyer, but the flag goes up before he can slot home the rebound. England have surprised Spain with their urgency in the first couple of minutes. 4 mins Puyol and Pablo are struggling to track Dyer&apos;s non-stop movement. Again Gerrard picked him out inside the box, but his lack of options ensured the move petered out. 6 mins Villa runs in the channel between Phil Neville and Woodgate, but the latter times a challenge perfectly to snuff out the attack. That&apos;s the first decent move Spain have put together. &quot;Am I right in remembering that England actually beat Spain on penalties in a competitive match a decade or so ago?&quot; asks Oliver Pattenden. Indeed, Euro 96 quarter-final. &quot;Because that really doesn&apos;t say a whole lot for Spain does it?&quot; 8 mins Spain are coming into this more now. Villa looks their liveliest threat, working a half yard of space from Ferdinand but firing into the side-netting. 10 mins England lack balance with Lampard on the left. He&apos;s cutting in at every opportunity, which is fine if you have a maurauding left-back who can get to the byline and whip crosses in. Unfortunately, England have Phil Neville. &quot;Do you think Second Choice Steve has taken his Guardian name to heart?&quot; says Simon Vaughan. &quot;How else do you explain his selection of Second Choice England?&quot; 12 mins If Shaun Wright-Phillips has an absolute shocker tonight - and he&apos;s not started well, allowing the ball to roll under his foot there - it&apos;ll be interesting to see how critical the BBC team are, given that his dad is in the studio. Hopefully Hansen will get stuck in anyway. 14 mins Foster has his first touch of an international football, neatly claiming Angulo&apos;s overhit cross. It&apos;s end-to-end stuff (if you only include the middle third of the pitch). 16 mins It seems Morientes simply can&apos;t hack it in English football - he&apos;s just missed an absolute sitter. The England defence was torn apart by a simple ball down the right flank, Villa flicked it inside to Morientes, who cleverly waited for Gary Neville to totally sell himself. Then, faced with only Foster to beat from eight yards, he skied his left-foot shot yards over the bar. I bet if this game was being played in the Bernabeu or the Mestalla he&apos;d have scored. 19 mins After their bright start, England have been lulled into playing at Spain&apos;s languid tempo and consequently are unable to impose themselves on the game. 21 mins Dyer is the one man injecting any pace into England&apos;s attacks. After skipping past his marker he lays the ball off to Wright-Phillips, but Capdevila just waits for SWP to shift it onto his right foot and then tackles him. I fear the part-time Chelsea winger is a one-trick pony who will never make an impact against high-calibre defenders. 24 mins With Lampard found in an inside-right position, it&apos;s left to Neville to provide width down the left again. This time he cuts in on his right foot and floats a high cross to Crouch, but the big man&apos;s header lacked both pace and direction. Other than that it was pretty good. 26 mins &quot;Villla looks sharp,&quot; says Oliver Thorpe, referring to the one class act on the pitch. &quot;How many times can you say the same of his namesake Aston? Spanish commentators pronounce Crouch, &apos;crutch&apos;, by the way.&quot; 28 mins The atmosphere inside the ground is virtually non-existent, unless you count the &quot;band&quot; trumpeting such lyrical classics as &quot;I&apos;m England till I die&quot;. &quot;Do you think Gareth Barry is sitting on the bench wondering what he did wrong to deserve being ignored from a team selection featuring precisely zero left-footed players?&quot; asks Martin Blogg. I should imagine he&apos;s absolute seething, Martin. &quot;Being left out in favour of Phil Neville must bring back horrible memories of Euro 2000, and the realisation that he&apos;ll just never, ever, make it as an England player.&quot; He can&apos;t play better than he has done this season, and yet even with Bridge and both Coles out injured, he still can&apos;t get a game. England are crying out for width on the left, as there&apos;s next to no productivity from SWP on the right. 31 mins England have a free-kick 40 yards out. Look for Lampard to try to deflect this one in off Crouch&apos;s head. Lampard runs up ... hits Crouch&apos;s head at the back post ... but the big fella&apos;s mistimed header actually sends the ball flying away from goal. 33 mins &quot;Yes, he&apos;s sharp, is Villa: maybe Gillett will sign him for Liverpool,&quot; chuckles Fred Lane. Hmm, and maybe a few Sheffield United players as well. Oh dear, is this game really so bad that it&apos;s come to this? 35 mins This may be dismal viewing (both the match and the commentary) but spare a thought for Ireland fans - they&apos;re drawing 0-0 with San Marino at half-time. The Ireland international team, that is, not the fans. Though the fans surely couldn&apos;t do any worse. 36 mins Angulo takes everyone by surprise by having a shot, but his left-footer curls harmlessly wide. Foster muddies his knees by diving across goal though, probably just to show he can. 38 mins Awful, awful finish from Crouch. After a spell of Spanish possession broke down on the edge of the England box, the home team broke. The ball was relayed forward to Gerrard 30 yards out. As Dyer made a dart to the left, taking both centre-halves with him, Crouch peeled off to the right. Gerrard chipped a brilliant pass to him with the outside of his right foot, but Crouch dragged his shot horribly wide from 12 yards. 40 mins Motson excels himself by blaming the 18,000 seats on the fact it&apos;s cold and it&apos;s February. Nothing to do with the fact England have been a boring team to watch for the last year. 42 mins That&apos;s that question answered then - no matter how poorly SWP plays, the BBC won&apos;t criticise him. After being tackled twice in quick succession, Lawro commends him on &quot;sticking with it, even though his confidence is down&quot;. What&apos;s he supposed to do? Just walk off the pitch? The guy is being paid goodness knows how many tens of thousands of pounds a week and is playing for England, yet despite seeing plenty of the ball, has failed to beat his man once or put over a decent cross in a whole half of football. 44 mins SCHOLESY, COME OUT OF RETIREMENT. Half time The half-time whistle is met by complete indifference from the underwhelmed crowd. Given the low opinion the public have of them, this is a really important game for McClaren and his team. McClaren seems to have forgotten to tell the team this. They started well, hassling the Spaniards all over the pitch, with Dyer particularly direct both in possession and running in behind the defence. But that only lasted for 10 minutes. Since then the game has been treated very much as a friendly, and that impression will only be reinforced by the multiple second-half substitutions. Half-time emails &quot;The papers here in Spain describe both sides as traditional underperformers, and on the evidence of that first half you&apos;d have to say they&apos;re right,&quot; says Kevin Mackenzie. &quot;By the way, where&apos;s Lampard? Time for Joey to make his debut I&apos;d say.&quot; Too right. He&apos;ll inject some life. &quot;Am I the only England fan rooting for Spain to rinse England and show everyone how big a mistake the FA made by &apos;choosing&apos; McClaren?&quot; asks Andrew Epps. I&apos;m fairly sure you&apos;re not, Andrew. &quot;McClaren&apos;s a genius, who has sussed out the whole point of friendlies,&quot; says David Marriott with more than a hint of intrigue. &quot;Which is to remember why Phil Neville, SWP, Carrick and Crouch shouldn&apos;t be picked in the first place.&quot; &quot;Can second choice Steve do us all a favour and never let Peter Crouch put on an England shirt again?&quot; begs Simon Horwell. &quot;How on earth did this man ever get a call up in the first place. He isn&apos;t even dangerous in the air and at 9&apos; 5&quot; that&apos;s quite an achievement. With Defoe being the only forward on the bench things don&apos;t look bright but at least it&apos;s a step in the right direction.&quot; He&apos;s neither acting as a target around which England can begin their attacks, nor providing any threat in behind. Nugent and Lita from the Under-21s would worry Puyol and co more. &quot;I want every Englishman to come off the pitch at full-time with blood and snot on their shirt front. Not Hugo Boss bodywash,&quot; says Andy in Canada. &quot;Then I will know the soft Sven/Beckham era is gone and the new Rooney/Barton era has begun.&quot; If they were playing it would be more likely. &quot;Shaun Wright-Phillips,&quot; begins Andy Bradshaw in disbelief. &quot;Why play a player who&apos;s played less football than me in the last two years when you have a player such as David Bentley at Blackburn, who can run at pace, hit decent crosses, spank wonder goals and is actually match fit.&quot; &quot;Wait a minute, are you actually at the match or sitting at home in your pants watching it on the TV?&quot; asks Daniel Afzal. &quot;If the latter, then I want your job!&quot; Surely my job would be better if it were the former. Actually, in this case perhaps not. &quot;I&apos;ve been out of the country a couple of years and was wondering do they still make cans of Lilt?&quot; asks Luke Crane. Of course, Luke. Just as Rob Smyth fails to get by without a can of Relentless a day, my life would be all the poorer without my daily dosage of Lilt. &quot;Could you send me one? I could send you a can of Tab in return.&quot; I&apos;d rather have Mountain Dew. &quot;The commentator on France-Argentina on Brazil&apos;s SportTV said in the first half that France without Zidane is like England,&quot; says Jean Fournier. Ouch! Half-time poem The England game has been so unpoemworthy that Darco Ooragnak has written about Ireland instead:  &quot;Its a surreal night over in San Marino, A night that we could do with the proper Keano. It&apos;s a night against a painter, a plumber and a part-time taxi-man, But is it a task too much for our man Stan? &quot;The teams walk out - not of a tunnel but from under some trees, They are not that big - they&apos;d only reach Big Niall Quinn&apos;s Knees. In the team-talk O&apos;Shea seems confused by his role, He wants the keeper&apos;s jersey - he wants to play in goal. &quot;Into the second half and all is level, With the San Marino players tackling like Phil Neville. The ref doesn&apos;t seem to care - as the tackle fly in, As Harte fluffs a free - God I miss Denis Irwin. &quot;Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall eating his curds and way, As Humpty pondered - pondering thoughts - he thought &quot;I&apos;ll play the Irish way&quot;, I&apos;ll kick and I&apos;ll run and I&apos;ll avoid the big goal, That way my manager will appear on the dole.&quot; 46 mins McClaren has made a change: Gerrard, a rare source of creativity for England, off, Barry on. Lampard will switch inside. Spain have made three-half time changes: Morientes, Ramos and someone else off, Torres, Angel and Navarro on. 48 mins It takes just two minutes for Barry to have an effort at goal. Well, I say &quot;at goal&quot;. It actually looped about 10 yards over the goal from the edge of the box, but it&apos;s a start. 49 mins England&apos;s attitude at the start of the second half has been positive - hopefully they&apos;ll maintain this approach for more than 10 minutes this time. After a lucky break, Gary Neville cuts the ball back from the touchline towards Lampard, but Pablo came across to cover and his brilliantly timed tackle denied the Chelsea midfielder. &quot;It may have been said before that second choice Steve is an a$$,&quot; says James Raiswell, &quot;but there&apos;s an undeniable resemblance between him and Donkey from Shrek.&quot; 51 mins Credit to SWP, who tracked Capdevila all the way back into his own penalty area before putting the left-back off as he lined up a shot. It would, however, be preferable to have Capdevila worrying about SWP&apos;s attacking threat rather than the other way around. 53 mins &quot;According to the BBC website: &apos;The full-back is scared of Shaun (Wright-Phillips). You can see that and if he takes him on he can frighten the defender even more.&apos; Ian Wright. Are you suggesting we believe you ahead of Arsenal and England legend Ian Wright? Surely Auntie wouldn&apos;t hire some bloke who doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s on about?&quot; Thanks for that quote, Laurence Davison (though what are you doing reading them?). That is truly farcical. 55 mins Fourth Spain substitution: Angulo off, Iniesta on. Incidentally, Puyol was the third Spanish player to be hauled off at half-time. In other news, Zinedine Kilbane has scored for Ireland. 56 mins SWP in miscontrol shock. That was a really promising situation, too. I don&apos;t want this MBM to become a personal attack on him, because he seems like a decent bloke, but he&apos;s been awful tonight and the BBC should say so. 58 mins Foster is called into action for the first time, palming away Villa&apos;s swerving shot from 20 yards. It was by no means an overly taxing save, but England goalkeepers have let those in in recent years. 60 mins &quot;Methinks England desperately need a dead ball specialist,&quot; says Michael Aston. &quot;They should consider that lad that plays in Los Angeles.&quot; Landon Donovan is American, Michael. GOAL! England 0 - 1 Spain (Iniesta 62) A wonderful strike. Villa escaped Woodgate with a deft Cruyff turn (is there any other kind of Cruyff turn?) on the left-flank, and whipped a cross into the box. Torres had pulled off Ferdinand forcing Phil Neville to come in to cover, but Ferdinand&apos;s slight touch took it away from them both and into the unmarked Iniesta&apos;s path on the right edge of the box. He took one touch to set himself before unleashing a right-foot half-volley that sped into the top corner. Foster had no chance at all. 65 mins Here come the cavalry: Richards and, er, Carragher on, Woodgate and Gary Neville off. Woodgate was impressively dominant on his return, but he was slightly at fault for the goal. England&apos;s third captain of the night is Ferdinand. 66 mins Fifth Spanish sub: Arizmendi on, Silva off. 68 mins The goal was just about deserved - not so much because Spain deserved to score it, but because England deserved to concede it. It&apos;s been that kind of game. 69 mins Fourth England sub: SWP off, Defoe on. Motty deigns to ask Lawro what he thought of Wright-Phillips&apos;s performance, because there&apos;s only one answer that could be given. It&apos;s the same word as the player who&apos;s just switched to the right flank: Dyer. 71 mins Lampard curls a decent free-kick towards Spain&apos;s six-yard box, where Casillas punches unconvincingly under a forceful challenge from Richards. The less said about Carrick&apos;s resultant shot, the better. &quot;In addition to Barry, a defender who has been brought on in midfield, we have Richards, Carragher, Terry and Dawson on the bench, along with two defensive midfield players in Barton &amp; Parker,&quot; notes Jeremy Solomon. &quot;We have one striker on the bench - Defoe. Do you think McClaren actually wants us to score?&quot; Very good point, Jeremy. In McClaren&apos;s defence, there isn&apos;t an abundance of great England goalscorers around. 73 mins More changes. Fabregas is the last Spanish entrant, replacing man-of-the-match Villa, while Downing comes on for Phil Neville. McClaren explained his omission of Barry yesterday by saying he didn&apos;t want to play him out of position at left-back. Er, where is he playing now? 75 mins SAN MARINO HAVE SCORED! Puts things into perspective a little. With Xavi, Iniesta and Fabregas on the pitch, Spain are like those schoolground bullies who nick your ball and refuse to give it back. 78 mins Fifth England sub: Lampard off, Barton on. The two indulge in a manly high-five slap, though they barely look at each other as they do so. Barton immediately slams into Fabregas, taking both ball and man before threading a pass through to Crouch. That&apos;s more like it! 81 mins Finally tempers are raised as - you guessed it - Barton crashes into the back of Albelda. The ref decides a booking would be inappropriate, with Lawro observing that &quot;it&apos;s not been that kind of game&quot;. Correct, Lawro, but that&apos;s the problem. It&apos;s not been England&apos;s type of game; it&apos;s been Spain&apos;s kind of game. Hence the scoreline. &quot;If you&apos;re shopping for blue-glazed Dutch pottery, can you do a Delft Cruyff turn?&quot; says Sean Cronin. 83 mins IRELAND HAS/HAVE SCORED Stephen Ireland scores a late, late winner for his team. If only we could find an equally talented Stephen England to save us. 85 mins One of the (many) reasons Crouch struggles against the better international teams is that the top defenders know how to persuade refs he&apos;s fouling them. Crouch timed his leap perfectly to head Barry&apos;s long ball there, but Navarro cleverly placed himself under the striker, making it look as if he was being pushed down. Yes, that was the main talking point of the last four minutes. 88 mins It gets worse. Downing seemed to have beaten Angel, but then sliced his cross into Old Trafford&apos;s second tier. England have been dreadful tonight. 90 mins There will be two minutes of added time. Given that there have been seven substitutions in the second half, and the referee is supposed to add on thirty seconds for each one, there should be at least three-and-a-half minutes. The ref has clearly taken pity on the poor souls witnessing this. Full time The loudest noise of the evening is the jeer delivered by the crowd on hearing the final whistle. England&apos;s performance was as poor as the game itself. I&apos;m sure McClaren will claim there are plenty of positives to take out of it, but I can&apos;t see any. Foster had nothing to do except pick the ball out of his net, the Nevilles were totally uncreative despite having plenty of possession, the otherwise solid centre-halves lost concentration briefly and paid the price, Gerrard and Lampard failed to impose themselves despite having Carrick sitting for them, Wright-Phillips was awful, Crouch barely got a kick (or a head), and Dyer faded after the first 10 minutes.  Ok, so it was only a friendly, but it was still a chance for McClaren to win over the public and for the players to find some rhythm. They managed neither against a fairly disinterested Spain team. If they play like that in Tel Aviv next month, they will lose. Of course, Rooney could be the catalyst for a vast improvement, but it&apos;s unlikely.

The England manager, Steve McClaren, stated beforehand that he and his players had everything to prove but they merely deepened the fears with this defeat. The national team had not been beaten at home since falling to Denmark in November 2003, and that, in compensation, had been a merry 3-2 result. There was none of that brightness last night to blind anyone to the realisation that Spain, all too predictably, had enjoyed technical superiority long before the substitute Andr\u00e9s Iniesta settled the contest beautifully. Despite flurries from England the visitors&apos; goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, had little more to do than deal with a reasonable attempt by Michael Carrick in the second minute. McClaren has now completed four fixtures without a victory, only one goal being scored in the process, and his side offered mere flurries last night. Joey Barton should be relieved that he was implicated only in the closing 11 minutes as he picked up his first cap. There are reasons for profound anxiety over the trip to meet Israel on March 24, with England already in difficulties in the Euro 2008 qualification group. Encouragement was short-lived against the visitors here. The manager can lament call-offs. It is no small matter, after all, to lack Wayne Rooney and Aaron Lennon, particularly since Kieron Dyer made a moderate return and Shaun Wright-Phillips floundered. Looking to them and the misfiring Frank Lampard, Peter Crouch would have regarded his cause as utterly doomed had it not been for intermittent aid from Steven Gerrard, prior to the stand-in captain&apos;s prearranged substitution. Although this was not England&apos;s ideal selection, they were at home and the manager has no right to present himself as a victim of circumstance. Considering that Northern Ireland had beaten Spain in September, Luis Aragon\u00e9s&apos;s squad should have experienced distress at Old Trafford. McClaren, new to the job and yet, as Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s assistant, so tethered to despondent times, lacks reserves of goodwill to call upon. The game in Tel Aviv has become a critical moment. Should events go wrong there McClaren will be aiming to mount a revival in the group amid scepticism and anger. Few in that situation ever recover their authority, or keep their job. Perhaps England will pull out of the tailspin next month, but it is now absolutely imperative that they do so. The display will have to be far more concerted than it was against Spain. England misled the Old Trafford audience whenever they excited them. In the first minute Dyer did cause mayhem with a low cross, but it was the prelude to nothing much at all. At the outset of the second half there was further misguided anticipation when Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez had to lunge to stop Lampard from capitalising on a Gary Neville cross. By and large, however, this was a prolonged flashback to Madrid in November 2004 when the comprehensive superiority of Aragon\u00e9s&apos;s team in a 1-0 win was nullified purely because the racist abuse by the Bernab\u00e9u crowd was so much more significant a matter. After 18 minutes, Miguel Angel Angulo rolled the ball to Fernando Morientes. The former Liverpool player then sidestepped an anxiously lunging Gary Neville before shooting ludicrously high. He might have sheepishly alleged there had been a bobble, but excuses were not so readily available to England. There could, at least, be a certain appreciation for Gerrard when he broke on the left six minutes from the interval. His delivery was accurate, but Crouch did not hit the target from an angle. The Liverpool forward, scorer of 11 goals for his country in a six-month spell last year, found life far harder here. England had almost no cause for complaint, even if the referee Michael Weiner rejected a plea for a penalty after a challenge on Dyer. Spain, with no inclination to take risks in an away fixture, put the accent on dependable technique. But they knew how to pick their moment and there had been evidence of that even before the opener. The splendid David Villa saw Ben Foster, in a good debut, pushing away a cleanly hit 20 yard shot and after 65 minutes the Valencia forward showed another part of his repertoire. Jonathan Woodgate, featuring in England&apos;s ranks for the first time since 2004, went out wide to his right and immediately regretted doing so. Villa beat him comprehensively and aimed a deep cross which brushed Rio Ferdinand&apos;s head before falling to Iniesta. From the fringe of the area he bent his drive slickly round Foster and high into the net. Spain&apos;s withdrawal of Villa soon afterwards was a scarce cause of gladness for McClaren.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-08T00:50:27Z", "title": "International friendly: England 0 - 1 Spain", "sentences": ["The game in Tel Aviv has become a critical moment."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/08/match.englandfootballteam"}, {"tags": ["Sport"], "article": "When Israel played England for the first time in a friendly back in 1986 we felt it was David against Goliath. I, like the rest of our players, was in awe and gave England a lot of respect. The gulf between the teams was huge and although we gave England a run for their money and lost 2-1 despite scoring first, the situation now is very different. Next month&apos;s game in Tel Aviv will not be that kind of match. Israel have progressed remarkably in the past 20 years or so while England are disappointing. Although Steve McClaren&apos;s side are still the better of the two, Israel can as good as bring their qualifying campaign to an end. England are not a great, invincible team. In the Premiership we see great performances from the English players, but the national team looks disintegrated and out of steam. They don&apos;t seem to gel and often we get far less than the sum of all the parts. It&apos;s maybe down to big egos, too many leaders on the pitch and a lack of a hierarchy. Steve McClaren has a great knowledge but seems to be quiet and not dominant enough. While Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard seem to lead Liverpool and Chelsea respectively, they don&apos;t seem to bring their qualities to the England games. The only player that Israel have no answer for is Wayne Rooney. He can be unstoppable but he can&apos;t control his temper for too long when things don&apos;t go his way. With the pressure of this qualifier, an Israel goal or stalemate might affect him in negative way. Both teams must win the match in order to stay in contention for Euro 2008 after defeats to Croatia and England&apos;s chances are still better than Israel&apos;s, but only just. A draw would be the predictable result which nobody would welcome. England are not good enough to win convincingly and Israel aren&apos;t good enough to dominate the game and crush opponents. There is a fresh wind in Israel&apos;s sails, however. It&apos;s a young, ambitious and talented team with a decent home record. Yossi Benayoun is the talisman of the team and a lot depends on him, but there are other key players. Dudu Aouate, the goalkeeper from Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, is in fantastic form and gives the midfielders confidence to go on the attack rather than just help their defence. Tal Ben Haim had a poor game against Croatia in our 4-3 home defeat back in November, but he is doing well against top strikers week in and week out. Another key player is the midfielder Michael Zandberg of Beitar Jerusalem, who is playing really well in the domestic league. Ben Sahar of Chelsea shows great promise and I would love to see Elyaniv Barda start in attack. Israel lack physical strength, mobility and experience in crunch games, however, and they will miss the feisty Idan Tal of Bolton, who is suspended. The importance of the game may takes its toll on the young players who have never taken part in such an occasion. Israel haven&apos;t played in a World Cup or European Championship for 37 years and pressure from media and supporters can affect our young players. Israeli fans can be a factor and push their team, but only if they are leading. An early England goal would turn the crowd against our players and recovery would be hard to achieve. I can see the game ending in draw. It would a respectable result for Israel but one that won&apos;t help either team achieve their goal.

Newcastle United&apos;s manager had specifically asked the England coach to play Dyer - who has made an impressive return to first-team action after months out with hamstring trouble - for only part of the game and will be anxiously assessing the midfielder for any after-affects at training this morning. &quot;I was surprised to see Kieron Dyer play for the full 90 minutes,&quot; said Roeder, whose side have a home game with Liverpool tomorrow and who noted that Steven Gerrard, the Merseysiders&apos; captain, was withdrawn at half-time after McClaren agreed to a request from Rafael Ben\u00edtez to play him for only 45 minutes. &quot;It was Kieron&apos;s first game for England for almost two years and I thought, generally, he did well. But I am sure Newcastle fans agree with me when I say that our last 12 games in the Premiership are more important than an England friendly with Spain.&quot; Ahead of England&apos;s game at Old Trafford Roeder - who has lost Michael Owen to a long-term injury sustained playing for England during last summer&apos;s World Cup and last week said he thought Dyer was feeling a little &quot;tired&quot; - had said: &quot;I hope Steve will be sensible - playing Kieron for 90 minutes would be taking things a little too far. I&apos;m sure he won&apos;t use Kieron for the whole game but will just give him a taste of what it&apos;s like to pull on an England shirt again.&quot; Meanwhile, Gerrard has admitted that England&apos;s substandard performances under McClaren, on the back of a hugely disappointing World Cup campaign, have eroded public confidence in the team. The players have been booed off in their last two matches at Old Trafford, as well as facing hostile chants when they lost in Croatia, and Wednesday night&apos;s captain believes the rancour will continue until they put together a run of results. &quot;The fans are upset,&quot; said Gerrard, one of the few players to emerge with any credit from the latest defeat. &quot;They pay a lot of money to follow us and they come to games expecting us to play well and score goals. They wanted us to come and wipe the Spanish away, so it&apos;s frustrating from the fans&apos; point of view. I understand their reaction. &quot;It might take a while to restore the public&apos;s confidence. I think it will come back, but not until we go on a good winning streak and start putting in some top-quality performances. We need to improve our game because that&apos;s the only way we are going to put it right.&quot; The crowd&apos;s reaction at the final whistle on Wednesday was not as severe as it had been in Zagreb, where there were chants of &quot;You&apos;re not fit to wear the shirt&quot; and calls for McClaren to be sacked, but it is still a deeply unsatisfactory way to build up to next month&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifiers, against Israel in Tel Aviv on March 24 and, four days later, what should be a considerably easier challenge, against Andorra in Barcelona, at the home of Espanyol. &quot;When you&apos;re losing games it&apos;s not good for confidence,&quot; said Gerrard. &quot;But I&apos;m confident we can get six points out of the two big tests next month, and that&apos;s the really important thing. Don&apos;t forget we&apos;re missing a lot of players at the moment. There&apos;s Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen, Owen Hargreaves and Aaron Lennon, just to name four.

The speculation may look hysterically premature, but he himself knows the jeopardy that comes in presiding over a bad patch that continued with the 1-0 loss to Spain in the Old Trafford friendly. There was pathos when he had to insist, so soon, that he is cut out for his role. &quot;I believe in myself, that I&apos;ve got the ability to do that job and get us qualified,&quot; McClaren stated, though it is no shield against the piercing criticism. Tel Aviv will be crucial to him and he pledges that the squad will be &quot;ready&quot; for the challenge. &quot;The rainbow, as they say, comes in Israel,&quot; McClaren remarked, in a peculiarly phrased piece of encouragement. &quot;This is where [the side] really will be judged, judged at the highest level.&quot; Those players, in truth, will be appealing against the grim verdict handed down by scathing fans on Wednesday. McClaren, appreciating the disadvantage of being Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s former assistant, has tried to shake the 2006 World Cup off his trail, but that gloomy event seemed to close in on him again at Old Trafford. Eriksson&apos;s squad selection was idiosyncratic last summer, but the lack of options was an extenuating factor. The Swede included the unfit pair of Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, as well as the unprepared Theo Walcott, because he could not think of anyone worth taking in their stead. Spain have now exposed the thinness of England&apos;s resources once again. McClaren calls out for competition for places, but few are equipped to take up the challenge. The manager admitted as much in his emphasis on the people missing from the defeat. He envied Spain for naming a squad of 20 players and still having them available at kick-off. England had six call-offs, while John Terry and Owen Hargreaves were in no condition to take part. Prospects would be improved if McClaren could call upon Terry, Hargreaves, Ashley Cole, Wayne Bridge, Joe Cole, Owen, Aaron Lennon and Rooney. The manager missed the latter in particular: &quot;He can make a difference. That was the thing that was missing - the quality in the final third.&quot; A few of those ruled out on Wednesday should be ready in Tel Aviv, but it is never safe to assume that absentees hold all the answers. Good as he is, Rooney, for example, has scored just three goals for England in the 32 months since Euro 2004, none of them in a competitive match. McClaren was far from bereft of talent against Spain, as England completed a stretch of four fixtures without a win in which they have recorded a single goal. The 4-3-3 system can only work if better care is taken of the ball. With Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard aiming to advance, Michael Carrick was outnumbered in midfield whenever a move broke down prematurely. &quot;We&apos;ve been saying for the many, many years that I&apos;ve been working with this team that possession of the ball is one thing that we do need to improve on,&quot; McClaren said disturbingly. If the appeal goes unheeded it must be because that style does not come naturally to England footballers. &quot;You don&apos;t have control over them when they&apos;re not here, so you can&apos;t affect them,&quot; the manager said, with an implication that the club approach is imprinted on his players. If so, England need to react accordingly. The left flank was barely operational at Old Trafford and England may do better by reverting to 4-4-2. That could require the dropping of either Lampard or Gerrard, with the latter more entitled to keep his place on Wednesday&apos;s showing. The display from the debutant goalkeeper Ben Foster did enhance his status as a challenger to Paul Robinson. Jonathan Woodgate, on his England comeback, was satisfactory until he got too tight on David Villa in the full-back area and was turned by the superb Valencia striker, who delivered the cross for Andr\u00e9s Iniesta&apos;s goal. It was a punishing element in Woodgate&apos;s refresher course at international level. McClaren also claimed that Kieron Dyer had given &quot;everyone a lift&quot;. This was so overblown an account of a reasonable showing that it must mean he is preparing to deploy the Newcastle United man in Israel. &quot;It&apos;s where you end, not where you begin,&quot; he said of a crucial year for him and England.

Many would say they have no other purpose, though at least they still unite the nation. Absolutely everybody is fed up with them. No one ever volunteers to carry your bags to an England friendly, in the way that strangers often will when they discover you are bound for a World Cup, an away leg in Europe or an FA Cup final. And after an England friendly, with occasional exceptions such as the exciting win over Argentina in Switzerland 15 months ago, some sort of inversion seems to apply. People come up and tell you they don&apos;t care how much you are paid, they couldn&apos;t watch another 90 minutes like that for a gold pig. At which point you start to feel sorry for all the people who paid out for tickets months ago and had been looking forward to a glimpse of Wayne Rooney, an England victory or even a goal. Instead they get cry-off after cry-off, half-baked formations, multiple substitutions and tedious excuses. When Steve McClaren compounds the felony by claiming to have been impressed by Jonathan Woodgate and Rio Ferdinand, when both had been at fault for Spain&apos;s winning goal last week, one can only wonder how long England can continue rooking the public before the police take an interest. In most activities where money changes hands, such a glaring discrepancy between goods advertised and goods received is against the law. Were England selling double glazing or timeshares they would be Watchdog regulars. Had Robbie Williams or U2 disappointed so dismally, they would be discussing refunds by now. Even the real England fans, the hardcore element who, despite all common sense and evidence to the contrary, agree with Richard Caborn that the national team is the glory of the English game, found Old Trafford hard to take. That&apos;s why they booed at the end. Most of them were only there in the first place because they had to be. Members of the official England fan club wishing to obtain tickets for future games abroad are obliged to prove their loyalty by attending friendlies. Not all of them wanted to be in Manchester on a wintry night with no prospect of entertainment, no Aaron Lennon and schoolboys with klaxons instead of atmosphere, but England have ways of making people attend. This might not amount to a scam as supporters still have a choice, though if loyalty is a two...#8209;way street England are presently failing to uphold their end of the bargain. At least when clubs operate voucher systems they deal in real games, they don&apos;t force supporters to watch the stiffs at half pace. If England wish to take a more honest approach to friendlies and their fans, they have two choices. Either they could drastically reduce the number of such games, permitting only eve-of-tournament warm-ups and thereby ensuring real teams turn up to play real football. Or they could opt to play friendlies in medium-size grounds around the country, with no great fanfare or overblown appeals to patriotism and tickets priced to reflect the fact that the team might be experimental and the occasion unmemorable. But England will be doing neither of those things because Wembley will be available for the next friendly and with an \u00a3800million stadium to be paid for, the hard sell is only just beginning. How hard the sell is depends on how England perform in their current qualification campaign. Should things go badly wrong in Tel Aviv next month, a 90,000 capacity might not be needed the numbers wanting to see England fail to reach a tournament for the first time in 14 years, even if FA chairman Geoff Thompson is adamant Wembley will truly be a worthy home of English football. Perhaps wisely, Thompson and his pals are stressing Wembley&apos;s wow factor at the moment, because the England wow factor simply doesn&apos;t exist. Novelty and prestige should help fill the ground if the first England game goes ahead as planned in late May, yet the fact remains that it will be a friendly, the first of many, and the England friendly is an anachronism in the modern game. There is clearly no appetite for these matches within Premiership clubs, no discernible desire to take part among players, little for the manager to learn and absolutely nothing for spectators to enjoy. Arsene Wenger put it into perspective yesterday when he said: &apos;National football is boring, you have to accept that. Club football has moved forward and national football has gone backwards.&apos; England will survive McClaren and will even survive the ignominy of watching Euro 2008 on television, should the worst come to the worst. But the England friendly is dead and non...#8209;events such as Wednesday&apos;s are not even going to be missed or mourned. Good luck to the new Wembley and all who sail in her, but good luck most of all to those with the responsibility of filling the place. It will take more than clever marketing, it will need some much clearer thinking. Had England presented such a muddled, messy and misconceived exercise as their last friendly at the most expensive stadium in the world it would have been little short of a national disgrace. The world is watching now and English football has to prove itself worthy of its shiny new home. It has long been understood that Steve McClaren was no one&apos;s first choice as England coach; now it is being unkindly suggested that he may be only the third-best coach on the FA payroll, up one place from last month thanks to the departure of Peter Taylor from the under-21s job. The long-suffering England fans who politely waited until the final whistle to vent their annoyance on Wednesday, registering a general protest without booing individual players or substitutions yet still managing to bug Gary Neville, believe Sven-Goran Eriksson, Terry Venables and Taylor would all have avoided McClaren&apos;s lopsided 4-3-3 system that resulted in a left flank so undermanned even Luis Aragones expressed surprise. McClaren puts this down to bad luck, in that Ashley Cole, Joe Cole and Wayne Bridge were all unavailable, though having brought Gareth Barry back into a heavily right...#8209;sided squad it was perverse to leave him out in favour of Phil Neville. The two Coles joined Owen Hargreaves, John Terry and a few others in having had great games for England, yet when McClaren reached for the withdrawals lifeline at least he wasn&apos;t timid about it. Third-rate McClaren counting on it all adding up in Tel Aviv &apos;Count them up,&apos; he said. &apos;We were missing seven or eight players I wanted to select.&apos; Right ho, then. Two Coles, Rooney, Johnson, Lennon, Terry, Hargreaves, Owen. That&apos;s eight without even mentioning Bridge or Kirkland. Given that McClaren also wanted to look at Lampard, Gerrard, Ferdinand, Foster, Woodgate, Barton and Dyer (he has probably seen enough of Crouch and Wright...#8209;Phillips), he would have had a hard time fitting them all in, but one takes the point that when England line up against Israel next month it could be with a completely different team. Let us hope so, anyway, because McClaren certainly does. &apos;I am relying on big players coming back,&apos; he confessed in advance of what might be his defining game. &apos;Everybody does. How many times do I read about Premiership clubs losing games because their best players are missing? We are just the same. It&apos;s not an excuse, it&apos;s a reason.&apos; Presumably this was not a line a coach with a reputation for bright, positive thinking peddled at his England interview. The danger of relying on reputations was fully exposed at the World Cup. Whatever happened to the idea that a coach could improve England, bring the best out of any given group of players? Because however unlucky he has been in the past couple of weeks, McClaren does have 88 players at his disposal and that is far more than any Premiership manager. Who says so? McClaren himself. &apos;Of 230 Premiership players, last time we looked 88 were English,&apos; he explained. That&apos;s eight teams by most people&apos;s reckoning, without counting Hargreaves in Germany, David Nugent in the Championship and David Beckham in purgatory. Yes, you might say, but who rates the Premiership these days? Well, McClaren for one. &apos;I still believe it is the best league in the world,&apos; he confirmed, bravely if hoarily in Wednesday&apos;s programme. &apos;I believe we have an excellent squad, not just for now but for the next four or five years, and we certainly have the talent and ability to win something.&apos; To which, after the game, there was only one response. When? &apos;We&apos;ve a long road ahead,&apos; was the deflating answer. &apos;I didn&apos;t say how long the road was, but it&apos;s a pretty long road from where we are and we know that.&apos; Everybody knows that. But though realism is welcome, England&apos;s narcissistic tendencies have clearly survived the culling of Beckham. If they could stop preening and prove they can still play football just a little bit, a nation would be grateful.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-11T00:03:23Z", "title": "Paul Wilson: Friendlies?

As well as the urgent need to finish second to Celtic in the Premier League in order to secure a place in next season&apos;s Champions League qualifying rounds, Rangers are still involved in the current Uefa Cup. Smith himself considers it a curiosity that a team that has suffered so much ignominy at home - a distance behind their fiercest rivals in the championship and eliminated from the CIS Insurance Cup by St Johnstone, of the First Division, and from the Scottish Cup by Dunfermline (bottom of the Premier League) - should retain an interest in Europe beyond the turn of the year. But he also realises that the last-32 tie with Hapoel Tel Aviv - the first leg in Israel is on Wednesday - offers a chance to provide evidence of an improvement in the morale, harmony and effectiveness of a group of players who had to endure quite a buffeting during the generally unproductive tenure of his predecessor, Paul Le Guen. He is also astute enough to recognise that Rangers are at this relatively advanced stage of the European competition largely as a result of having encountered some seriously poor opposition during the earlier phases. His acknowledgment that much more formidable rivals lie ahead is followed by a dismissal of the suggestion that Rangers should be propelled by incentive because this year&apos;s final is scheduled for Hampden Park. &apos;In any European tournament, the longer you go, the more difficult it becomes,&apos; said Smith. &apos;In the Uefa Cup it is especially harder because, at this stage, the entry of the teams who finished third in their Champions League groups take it to another level. &apos;I really don&apos;t think at this point that we should be looking as far ahead as the final, even if it is in Glasgow,&apos; he added. &apos;The first objective is to get past Hapoel, which will be difficult enough. The strangest aspect of this is that we should still be involved in Europe in a season when the domestic form has not been good. &apos;Sometimes, it happens like that, but it can be difficult to understand. Arsenal are a good example, when you consider that they seem to have done better in Europe when their league form has been unconvincing than they have when they were marauding through the Premiership. &apos;And it doesn&apos;t matter what anyone says, if you don&apos;t have any success domestically, you&apos;ve no base on which to build. What Europe offers is a chance to find out how your players can handle it. So far, we&apos;ve been very satisfied with the way the group of players we have here have reacted to what we&apos;ve asked of them.&apos; Rangers&apos; most advantageous achievement under Le Guen was to win their Uefa Cup group, allowing them to face opponents who finished third in theirs and avoid the potentially stronger sides who have been parachuted in from the Champions League. Hapoel won only one of their four matches in finishing third behind Panathinaikos and Paris St-Germain and the recent decision to jettison their manager, Itzhak Shum, and replace him with Nir Levin, hints at a certain disarray. Much like Rangers, in fact. But Smith&apos;s first act, to buttress his defence through the acquisition of the experienced David Weir and Ugo Ehiogu, has already yielded a return, Rangers not having conceded a goal in the three matches played under the new manager. They are likely to require old heads at their most composed in Tel Aviv, where the atmosphere created by feverish fans can rival the kind of climate associated with Greece and Turkey. Hapoel also play an aggressive style, a 4-3-3 formation, with two wide players, Gil Vermouth and Salim Toema, supplying principal striker Elyaniv Barda. &apos;There&apos;s always a chance that they&apos;ll have changed a little, with the new manager coming in,&apos; said Smith, &apos;but I wouldn&apos;t think there would be much departure from their normal, attacking game, especially in the home match. &apos;They are fairly aggressive, they don&apos;t go keeping possession for possession&apos;s sake, but like to get the ball forward as quickly as possible. And, by all accounts, the fans create quite an atmosphere. Our coach, John Brown, went to see them and there were a lot of flares and a lot of singing, both of which got them Uefa fines.&apos; Smith will probably be as surprised as the majority of observers in Scotland if Rangers fail to negotiate this next obstacle.

The Billy Boys, the song which prompted Uefa action after Rangers&apos; Champions League matches against Villarreal last season, was audible from the stands during the game against Kilmarnock on Sunday. And although progress has been made in the club&apos;s battle against bigotry the manager Walter Smith yesterday stressed the value of good behaviour. &quot;Last year Rangers were penalised by Uefa for discriminatory singing by fans and narrowly escaped paying a much heavier price,&quot; Smith said. &quot;None of us want to see anything like that happening again and hindering the progress the team can make. We must work on the basis that any club can be penalised at any time for inappropriate behaviour.&quot; His assistant Ally McCoist said: &quot;In this day and age we have to move forward because there is no place for it at any level of football.

From then on, the Moscow newspaper Sport Express excitedly claimed, Russian football would be divided into two periods: Before and After Lisbon. Two years later, though, that triumph increasingly appears a false dawn. It certainly hasn&apos;t been a watershed for eastern European football as a whole. Although six eastern teams reached the group stage of the Champions League this season, they won just four games out of 28 against sides from outside the region. The position of Russian football is harder to assess, however: should they celebrate the fact that two Russians sides got into the group stage, or should they lament the fact that both - CSKA and Spartak - are now in the Uefa Cup? CSKA will feel frustration that they have not followed up their success by imposing themselves on Europe in the way that, say, Dynamo Kyiv did in the late nineties, but, for them, the outlook is generally positive. Last season&apos;s exit in the Uefa Cup group stage was an embarrassment, but this season they took four points from Arsenal - a touch fortuitously, admittedly - and ultimately were undone only by an abysmal first half against Porto in Moscow. Their manager, Valeri Gazzaev, has made all the right noises about taking nothing for granted ahead of their first leg against Maccabi Haifa, but there is no doubt that the club expect a fairly comfortable passage to the last 16. They have, after all, recent memories of success in Israel, having won a friendly tournament that included Maccabi in Tel Aviv last month. That earned them $1m in prize money but, as several Israeli newspapers acerbically noted, the real contest seemed to be less the football than which Russian billionaire could throw the most lavish party. The point, anyway, is that all the friendly tournaments in the world, even the Uefa Cup, mean nothing when the Champions League is so obviously the benchmark. &quot;We need a European Cup and as soon as possible,&quot; Gazzaev said back in the autumn, &quot;and Daniel Carvalho has promised to get me one.&quot; He may be waiting some time. Domestically, CSKA remain untouchable, having won back-to-back doubles. The loss of Sibneft&apos;s patronage appears not to have harmed them unduly, although there has been a significant loss of revenue since Vneshtorgbank took over sponsorship of the club. The squad itself is probably stronger than it was when they won the Uefa Cup. The core of that side remains - Igor Akinfeev, the best Russian keeper since Rinat Dassaev; the colossal Berezutsky  twins at the back; the elegant Sergei Ignashevich sweeping behind them; the winger Yuri Zhirkov; and the Brazilian duo of Carvalho and Vagner Love continuing to spread menace in the attacking third - and they have been supplemented by some intriguing signings. Last season Jo, the youngest ever scorer for the Brazilian side Corinthians and still only 19, looked sensational, hit 13 goals in his first 11 league games before succumbing to injury, and the policy of buying youth has continued, with two 18-year-old midfielders, Caner Erkin of Turkey and Ramon of Brazil, arrived for a combined fee of around \u00a35m. Both of them, though, will miss tonight&apos;s game through injury. After the Uefa Cup triumph, Gazzaev spoke of how his side had &quot;relieved Russian football of its complexes&quot;, and in terms of breaking the sense of inferiority that led to some supinely defensive displays in away games, he is probably right. What he cannot relieve Russian football of, though, is its climate. After the dreadful performance against Porto on a rutted pitch in Moscow before Christmas, CSKA have decided to play the home leg of their tie against Maccabi in the Caucasian warmth of Vladikavkaz. They can, at least, be sure of a warm reception - for Gazzaev, a native of Vladikavkaz, is so popular there that when CSKA won the Uefa Cup, the city declared a public holiday. That, though, is still not the same as playing at home. There is also the more fundamental point that CSKA qualified for this season&apos;s Champions League by winning the league in November 2005. Russian clubs are disadvantaged by the structure of their season. For one thing, CSKA go into tonight&apos;s game having not played a competitive game since mid-December. For another, as CSKA found to their cost in the late nineties as they lived the dream and lurched towards bankruptcy, it is difficult to budget for financial rewards that will only begin to be accrued eight months after they have been earned - reinvesting in the squad is a far more precarious business than in the west, where European competition begins three months after titles are won. That is why the Ukrainian model, of a season that begins and ends in summer, with a three-month winter break and only a month&apos;s gap between the end of one campaign and the beginning of the next, for all its perverseness, makes some kind of sense. CSKA&apos;s president, Yevgeny Giner, has recently spoken out in favour of adopting something similar. Even if CSKA - or Spartak, who face Celta Vigo - do progress, though, it should not disguise the fact that Rubin Kazan and Lokomotiv Moscow, Russia&apos;s two Uefa Cup entrants, both slipped out in the first round. CSKA may be thriving After Lisbon, but the rest of Russian football has barely noticed the change.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-14T11:38:25Z", "title": "Jonathan Wilson on the state of Russian football", "sentences": ["They have, after all, recent memories of success in Israel, having won a friendly tournament that included Maccabi in Tel Aviv last month."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/14/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "The crowd at Old Trafford would be happy if they never got another look at England&apos;s defeat by Spain, but the players responsible will not be let off so lightly. Each will be receiving a DVD of his own performance. This is no punishment, just part of the standard procedure put in place by Steve McClaren. &quot;The message is that we&apos;re not forgetting about England in between games, and the players are not either,&quot; said the manager yesterday. By and large, England have been unimpressive under McClaren, but he has used his first season in charge to emphasise the responsibility he and his squad have for performances long after they are over. He does not want the national team to be forgotten as players immerse themselves in the lives of their clubs. The DVDs are prepared and distributed, with match stats for the individual in question, by the coach Steve Round. &quot;We always give them feedback: positive, negative, whatever we feel,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;We all learn from that. We lost a game of football [to Spain], we have been criticised individually and collectively. We have to use that. It gives you that anger, that determination, we are going to prove people wrong. That&apos;s the reaction I want. These players we know, I know are good enough to qualify and go into this tournament [Euro 2008]. They can be contenders and one of six or seven teams who can win it. We know we have the players, we have to start proving it.&quot; There will be no DVD in Owen Hargreaves&apos; mailbox since he was not fit to take part in last week&apos;s friendly, but he does typify a level of application that McClaren would love to see emulated by others. &quot;Yes, we need him,&quot; said the manager. &quot;I always remember the first time he played in a [2002] World Cup warm-up match and wanted me afterwards to get the video out and go through his game with him. That was four or five years ago. I went, &apos;phew!&apos; That was very, very unusual. Most players you have to drag in but he would ask questions and I thought, &apos;This is a different breed, a different mentality altogether&apos;.&quot; McClaren believes that his predecessor Sven-Goran Eriksson automatically named Hargreaves in squads because of the player&apos;s desire to improve. With fans picking him as their England player of the year for 2006, the Bayern Munich midfielder has now gained a general appeal. He has just come back from a broken fibula and has been unwell recently, but the German club are still trying to get him to appear in Saturday&apos;s match in Aachen. His status with Bayern developed slowly and McClaren feels that the self-belief he eventually gained by proving himself in the Bundesliga paved the way for his remarkable showing in the World Cup quarter-final with Portugal. In addition, the England manager is convinced that Hargreaves can be the essential &quot;glue&quot; in the midfield for the Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel next month. &quot;The majority of good teams have somebody who gels it all together. You had Roy Keane, Claude Makelele, Dunga. He does the unseen work and allows other players to express themselves more,&quot; said McClaren, who argues that Hargreaves has shown that he has a liberating effect on Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. &quot;He does the unseen work, makes a thousand tackles and interceptions, the unseen things in the game that are very important to make it a better team. He creates a different kind of tempo. He is an English-style player despite never having played in England.&quot; When England play in Tel Aviv on March 24, the probability is that the Bayern player will be part of a four-man midfield, with Gerrard towards the right, Lampard in the centre and Kieron Dyer on the left. Wayne Rooney and Andy Johnson, who missed the friendly with Spain, could well be the partnership in attack and it is expected that Paul Robinson will return in goal. More dramatic changes are not in the offing. McClaren is full of admiration for David Beckham&apos;s scoring return to the Real Madrid line-up, but has &quot;no plans&quot; to see the former England captain. While England stand third in Group E of the Euro 2008 qualifiers the manager expects his existing squad to vindicate itself. &quot;In every tournament I&apos;ve been involved in,&quot; McClaren said, &quot;it&apos;s always gone down to the last two games. This will be no different. You have to be judged at the end of the campaign. We have got the players. I know that. The players know that. &quot;We&apos;ve got eight games to play, three away games [against Israel, Andorra and Estonia] coming up. The next one is the most important one, and it is Israel. We are going there to win. But nobody qualifies in March. Qualification comes in November. People have got to remember that. &quot;We have the players, and the coaching staff, including myself, to deliver. No reservations about that whatsoever. We have to have the players out there with the character to handle situations like Israel away.

Regular visitors to the new stadium, including season ticket holders and reporters, have noted that, while attendance figures give the impression that it is at or close to its 60,500 capacity, the reality is that at times numerous seats have been empty. Sunday&apos;s game against Wigan Athletic was a case in point, with the official figure of 60,049 at odds with the large number of empty seats. The club confirmed yesterday that the figure announced was for tickets sold rather than actual attendance and that on average as many as 3% of ticket holders - more than 1,800 people - did not take up their seats. The number of no-shows reflects the increase in corporate season ticket holders at the stadium and the club will trial a buy-back system later this year that will allow fans to purchase seats that season ticket holders are not going to take up. Arsenal have decided to run the system in-house rather than use a ticket agency. Becks has eye on England David Beckham will be among those watching closely when England take on Israel in their crucial qualifying game against Israel in Tel Aviv next month. Being discarded by Steve McClaren was a major factor in the former England captain&apos;s decision to join LA Galaxy at the end of this season, but it is believed that Beckham might rethink his move if there was a real prospect of prolonging his England career and overhauling Bobby Moore&apos;s record of 108 caps. Even if England should lose in Tel Aviv it remains unlikely that Beckham will get his wish, not least because the FA is minded to give McClaren every chance to complete the qualifying campaign. But if England struggle and Beckham flourishes, it could get interesting.

BOA chairman Lord Moynihan insisted there was no clash with the London 2012 team&apos;s search for blue-chip sponsors: &quot;What our teams get from this is the sort of business advice and acumen that money cannot buy, and it will be invaluable in making governing bodies better able to manage the new funding they receive.&quot; BOA performance director Sir Clive Woodward was in no doubt about the value of bus-iness input: &quot;For every book about sport I read, I read six about business,&quot; he said.

He should have known better - the tsars of Russia&apos;s long-standing House of Romanov were (for over a century at least) broadly popular with their followers, never tried to annex Dundee and, perhaps most poignantly, didn&apos;t get in a big strop and accuse everyone of cheating every time something didn&apos;t go their way. Which is, once again, exactly what our Vlad has been up to - accusing the Old Firm clubs of &quot;buying off&quot; referees and players in Scotland even though he&apos;s already appealing a SFA fine handed down for accusing referees of bias last season. &quot;The Queen&apos;s Celtic and Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers?

Brazilian side Flamengo were far from tickled pink by having to play their Libertadores Cup clash with Bolivia&apos;s Real Potosi at 4,000m above sea level. Players had to go repeatedly to the sideline to be given oxygen in the &quot;unsporting and inhumane conditions&quot;. Despite drawing 2-2, they were in downbeat mood as they made the 170km trip across mountain trails to the nearest airport to catch a plane home. No Jackett required: Swansea City and manager Kenny have agreed to live separate lives after Saturday&apos;s defeat to Oldham sent the club out of the League One play-off places. The Queen&apos;s Celtic will have the privilege of being eliminated from Big Cup in the San Siro, after Uefa agreed to let AC Milan and Internazionale host their ties there despite safety concerns around the stadium - capacity will be slashed, however.

Von Anhalt&apos;s insistence that he might be the real father is all the more remarkable - he filed a paternity suit this week - given that he is principally known for being the ninth husband of 90-year-old Zsa Zsa Gabor and for attempting to sue the makers of Viagra after claiming the drug made him impotent. Almost everything else about the man, from his real age to the manner in which he came by his &quot;title&quot;, is the subject of speculation; his Wikipedia entry makes for fascinating reading.

Trapped in the storm&apos;s convection currents and surrounded by lightning, she was whisked up to 30,000ft - the cruising altitude of a 747, where oxygen is in short supply and the temperature is about -50C - whereupon she blacked out. After 40 minutes she came to, piloted herself out of the clouds and landed safely. When rescuers found her she was still covered in ice, but she escaped without injury, apart from frostbite. Undaunted, Wisnierska still hopes to compete in the championships later this month. It seems somehow inappropriate to wish her good luck Omar Sharif A few decades ago any parking valet would have considered it an honour to be punched by the legendary Omar Sharif, but we live in coarser times, and this week the elegant Egyptian actor entered a plea of no contest (a more refined form of guilty) to misdemeanour battery over an incident in 2005. It had been alleged that the 74-year-old Sharif, upon leaving a Beverly Hills restaurant, became upset that his SUV wasn&apos;t waiting there for him - a state of mind exacerbated by the valet&apos;s refusal to accept a 20 euro note as a tip. He countered this effrontery by calling the valet a &quot;stupid Mexican&quot; (close, he was Guatemalan) and breaking his nose. Sharif has now been fined and ordered to attend anger management classes. Prior to this he hadn&apos;t hit anyone since 2003. At his age shouldn&apos;t he be allowed to hang on to this anger?

Carter is older and perhaps wiser than the president who doggedly brought Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin together at Camp David in 1978, though the &quot;autonomy&quot; tacked on to the &quot;separate peace&quot; excoriated by most other Arabs never went anywhere. Still, power to collect garbage and exterminate mosquitoes under Israeli occupation was never going to be enough for the Palestinians. The intifadas of 1987 and 2000 were terrible reminders of the price of stagnation: things have got much, much worse, since he was in the White House. Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid tells us little that is new or especially insightful to Arabs, Israelis or Europeans. But Carter challenges decades of mainstream American thinking to argue forcefully that Israel is an ally that has been far too closely protected by US power as it has continued occupying Arab territory, notwithstanding its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. This view is hardly inflammatory and certainly not anti-semitic, as some of his harsher critics claim. Most of what he says is the stuff of everyday debate on the left and centre in Israel itself and is winning converts among some Jews elsewhere. Controversy about the book flows largely from the word &quot;apartheid&quot; in the title: it is wrong if applied to Israel within its pre-1967 borders, where there is discrimination but not institutionalised racism. In the West Bank, with its confiscated land, unequal allocation of water resources, fortress-like settlements, security fence and segregated roads, it is fitting enough. No one who has seen subjugated Palestinians struggling with everyday life alongside armed Jewish settlers can quarrel with it. Carter implies that South African-type pariahdom will follow if the conflict is not justly and swiftly resolved - though that would have been a lot easier to achieve in 1978. Nowadays Israelis (and Jews) worry about the de-legitimation of their state, especially as the rise of the Islamist Hamas has revived anxieties about recognition that the PLO had resolved. The ranting of a Holocaust-denying Iranian leader pursuing nuclear weapons doesn&apos;t help. The answer is to go back to first principles: two states in Israel and Palestine. Historical interpretation and contemporary controversy coexist even more explosively in a new book by the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe. His story begins in March 1948, when the Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion and his advisers met in Tel Aviv to discuss strategy. Fighting had been going on since the previous November when the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. By May 15, when the British mandate ended and Israel declared its independence, 250,000 Palestinians had already become refugees. By the end of the year there were 750,000-plus. Few ever returned to homes taken over by Israelis in Jaffa, Haifa and Jerusalem, or blown up and bulldozed in hundreds of villages. Pappe, the revisionists&apos; revisionist, identifies that March meeting as the start of a campaign of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; - a term coined in Yugoslavia in the 1990s but foreshadowed in Hebrew usage at the time. For him it was the result of a Zionist ideology whose &quot;wordless wish&quot; was for the Palestinians to disappear to make way for the Jewish state. Israel&apos;s &quot;war of independence&quot; or &quot;liberation&quot; was the Palestinians&apos; nakba - &quot;catastrophe&quot;. Pappe takes issue with fellow scholar Benny Morris, pioneer of the &quot;new&quot; history that has supplanted the rose-tinted version of the birth of Israel in which intransigent Arabs were largely the authors of their own misfortune. If Morris undermined the foundations of the old myths and smashed large parts of the walls, Pappe brings the roof crashing down: his clear view is that the expulsion and dispossession of the Palestinians was a grand design, not the partially planned and locally varied phenomenon - tragic but inevitable in the circumstances - that Morris painstakingly reconstructed from the Israeli archives 20 years ago. Emphasis apart, it is hard to say what is new in his account. The scheme discussed at the Tel Aviv meeting, Plan Dalet, has been known about for years. It has long been clear that the Palestinians were not, as used to be claimed, encouraged to leave their homes &quot;temporarily&quot; by Arab leaders. The fledgling Israeli state was not invaded, as the old David and Goliath narrative goes, by five Arab armies. Egypt attacked in the south and Jordanian and Iraqi troops entered the territory allotted to the Palestinians by the UN. Ethnic cleansing in Palestine is Israel&apos;s &quot;original sin&quot; laid bare - but without any mitigating circumstances. Rare exceptions in a catalogue of intimidation, expulsion and atrocity include the Jewish mayor of Haifa appealing to the city&apos;s Arabs to stay, despite attacks by Haganah forces. Nazareth&apos;s Christian Arabs were spared because Ben-Gurion realised that the outside world would not tolerate their removal. Pappe follows writers such as Meron Benvenisti who have documented the post-war cover-up: the rubble of Palestinian villages buried under parks and nature reserves, their fields and olive groves taken over by kibbutzim and immigrant housing projects, their Arab names Hebraized - or restored to their pre-Islamic biblical Hebrew ones. He fights the &quot;power of deletion&quot; over the fate of the Palestinians. But he does historical understanding a disservice by all but ignoring the mood and motives of the Jews, so soon after the end of a war in which six million had been exterminated by the Nazis. Ben-Gurion&apos;s public rhetoric about the dangers of annihilation or a second Holocaust, Pappe argues, was matched by private confidence about the outcome of an unequal fight. That does not mean the shadow of the Holocaust can be airbrushed out of the story. The Jews were fighting, as they saw it, with their backs to the wall, for survival. To ignore that perception - a huge factor in western sympathy for Israel in 1948 and for so long afterwards - is to misrepresent reality. Pappe&apos;s Israel is the &quot;last post-colonial European enclave in the Arab world&quot;. It is true that Zionist settlers did act in many ways like French pieds noirs in Algeria or Brits in Rhodesia. But most wanted to replace rather than exploit the natives. The immigrants who began arriving in the late 1880s, their numbers peaking in 1935 with 60,000 mostly German Jews, were invariably fleeing discrimination, pogroms or, after 1945, worse. Few were leaving good lives or moving to a classic colony. It is not sufficient, in other words, to subsume Zionism into the wider narrative of colonialism, though that specificity made no difference to the final outcome - the near-eradication of Arab Palestine. Rashid Khalidi, the Palestinian historian, lingers perceptively on this absolutely vital point: Zionism simultaneously oppressed the Palestinians and represented a movement of national liberation for the Jews - and has produced a new people speaking their own language, living in a country called Israel. It is not a question of whether Arabs or anyone else find that paradox palatable or just. It is that this important story, then as now, doesn&apos;t make any sense without grasping it. Khalidi, tackling &quot;historical amnesia&quot;, brilliantly analyses the structural handicap which hobbled the Palestinians throughout 30 years of British rule so that by the time the last high commissioner sailed away in 1948 they could neither accommodate nor successfully resist the Jews. His image of an iron cage represents the limits placed on them by the Balfour declaration in 1917, when the Jews were promised a &quot;national home&quot; as long as it was built without prejudice to the rights of what were absurdly called &quot;non-Jewish communities&quot; (then 90% of Palestine&apos;s population). This inbalance was constant: the UN partition decision of November 1947 gave the Jews, by then 33% of the population, half of the territory when they owned just 6% of the land. By 1949 they controlled 78% of it. Auden might have been anticipating the fate of the Palestinians in 1937 when he wrote in his great poem, &quot;Spain&quot;, that &quot;History to the defeated may say alas but cannot help or pardon.&quot; Pappe&apos;s militant work challenges such fatalism - though his call for a single binational state to replace Israel will neither persuade his Jewish fellow citizens nor convince Palestinians that it is achievable.

Perhaps more significantly for Smith and his club&apos;s supporters, though, is the fact that Celtic cannot seal their second straight championship on March 11 - the day of the third Old Firm match of the season - so long as Rangers keep winning. Yet the lack of spark in Smith&apos;s team is both glaring and worrying with Thursday&apos;s crucial Uefa Cup visit of Hapoel Tel Aviv in mind.

Uefa sought an explanation after a minority of Rangers&apos; fans at the first leg in Israel last Wednesday night were pictured making Nazi-style salutes. While Uefa last night confirmed no disciplinary action will be taken, the situation represents an embarrassment for Rangers, who were fined \u00a313,000 last season after fans were found guilty of racist chanting. Rangers&apos; supporters argue that the gesture is a red hand of Ulster salute, rather than a fascist one, and the club&apos;s chief executive, Martin Bain, said: &quot;Some Rangers fans continue to give red hand salutes which the club and the majority of supporters discourage because they will be misinterpreted.&quot; Rangers are insisting they would make the guilty supporters, rather than themselves, pay any Uefa fine in the event of further trouble tonight. On the field Walter Smith will make a late decision on the defender Karl Svensson. Rangers trail 2-1 from the first leg and, if Svensson fails to recover from a groin injury, Brahim Hemdani will move from midfield into central defence. Otherwise Smith will deploy Hemdani alongside the fit-again Kevin Thomson and Barry Ferguson in a three-man midfield.

This was Rangers&apos; best showing since Smith returned as manager last month but his post-match thoughts centred on the late dismissal of Allan McGregor. The goalkeeper saw red after a seemingly innocuous clash with Hapoel&apos;s Luciano De Bruno as the Israelis sought a quick kick-off after Rangers&apos; third goal.  Smith said: &quot;It was a difficult one for me because I was in the stand. From where I was, I saw the ball kicked up the pitch and their player run towards it and towards Brahim Hemdani and Allan McGregor.

Ferguson, the player of the match, added a more realistic look to the scoreline by rounding off a swift move featuring Alan Hutton and Dado Prso. While the players were celebrating McGregor was sent off, sparking a heated exchange between Smith and his counterpart, Nir Levin.  However, it did not stop Rangers scoring again.

England travel to Tel Aviv for a match which may make or break their Euro 2008 qualification campaign. With that uppermost in their head coach&apos;s mind, the news that Terry suffered ligament damage to his right ankle during Chelsea&apos;s 1-1 draw at Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday night came as a severe blow to McClaren&apos;s preparations. Terry could not walk without the aid of crutches after the match and underwent a scan on the ankle yesterday afternoon to determine the seriousness of the injury, but Chelsea will not make the results public until today. It is likely McClaren will give the defender as much time as he needs to prove his fitness before the squad get- together on March 20. The coach has a record of including injured players in his training camps. Indeed, Terry was involved in the build-up to England&apos;s 1-0 defeat to Spain this month despite having only recently recovered from surgery on a slipped disc in his back. What is a setback for England is doubly so for Chelsea. They enter Sunday&apos;s Carling Cup final against Arsenal with Ricardo Carvalho as their only recognised centre-half and will have to field Michael Essien in central defence. Their vice-captain Frank Lampard described how Chelsea&apos;s players&apos; &quot;hearts sank&quot; when they watched Terry hobble out of Wednesday&apos;s match, saying that it soon became clear the injury would rule him out of the Carling Cup final. &quot;Of course no one wants to lose a player of John&apos;s calibre - great defender,&quot; said Lampard. &quot;He&apos;s a big player for us, so your heart does sink, especially after losing him for so long and getting him back and then losing him again. &quot;We all know John and he wouldn&apos;t have come off unless it was a problem. So for him to miss a final, he will be definitely disappointed with that to say the least, so it&apos;s unfortunate. &quot;We&apos;ll try and deliver the trophy for all of us, John as well. We&apos;re a squad and we&apos;re a team. I&apos;m sure if John&apos;s not fit he will be there with us right amongst it, so we&apos;ll take it as a team if we can win it.&quot; With Terry out, Lampard is the only player still involved from the last time Chelsea and Arsenal met in a cup final. That ended in a 2-0 FA Cup triumph for the Gunners in 2002 and the memory still rankles with the England midfielder. &quot;It&apos;s five years since,&quot; said Lampard. &quot;It was a massive disappointment; it still sticks in the memory. It was a big occasion and when you fight as hard as we did to reach a final and lose it as we did, then it is obviously disappointing. &quot;It&apos;s not that we weren&apos;t confident but when we went there Arsenal were a very strong team. I think now we go there with a different mentality. We go there to win and hopefully we&apos;ll do that, put it right.&quot; Lampard rightly states that much has changed in the intervening period, with Roman Abramovich&apos;s \u00a3500m-plus investment in Chelsea having transformed the club. &quot;We&apos;re a different club now, a different team and a different set of players,&quot; he said. &quot;Me and John, I suppose, are the only ones left. I span both [periods]. &quot;Then we were a team that was delighted to get to an FA Cup final, fourth or fifth in the league. Now it&apos;s different expectations and rightly so because of the injection of money we&apos;ve had and because of the squad we have. So we go there very determined to win.

Both show scenes from the Palestinian intifada, the uprisings against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Both are from computer games: not the profit-driven, entertainment that fill the homes of teenagers across the world, but a little-noticed, alternative breed of game more concerned with politics, ideology and overturning notions of right and wrong. On the left is a game called The Stone Throwers, written by a Syrian programmer. A player takes the part of a young Palestinian man standing before the al-Aqsa mosque in the old city of Jerusalem. The Palestinian is armed with stones; to win the game he must throw them at the Israeli soldiers advancing towards him on the screen. Once the game ends, a message appears on the screen in English: &quot;Well maybe you have killed some of the Israeli soldiers in the computer world, but this is the real world.&quot; A screen appears showing a photograph of a crowd carrying the open coffin of a boy draped in what appears to be the Palestinian flag. &quot;Stop the killing of the innocents in Palestine before the game is really over,&quot; it says. On the right side of the wall is a second game called intifada, created in Israel in 1989, not long after the start of the first Palestinian uprising. This time the player takes the part of a lone Israeli soldier facing a violent Palestinian demonstration. The soldier is armed with a selection of weapons, ranging from a wooden club through to tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. To win, the player must stay alive and disperse the crowd while injuring or killing as few Palestinians as possible. The player is given orders forbidding the use of the live ammunition at his disposal and to win he must play within the rules. If he uses too much violence, he is given more restrictive rules; if he uses too little, the rules are relaxed. If too many Palestinians are killed, the game is lost. The two games were among dozens gathered together recently at the Israeli Centre for Digital Art in Holon, near Tel Aviv. Some were professionally produced, others adapted and subverted from mainstream games or written entirely by independent programmers. The exhibition, called Forbidden Games, uncovered a sophisticated sub-culture that is re-interpreting the conflicts that have shaped the Middle East. For an Israeli audience in particular, the exhibition is the first time many of the games from the Arab world had been shown in public. &quot;Some of the games are very provocative. You can&apos;t find them in Israel,&quot; said Galit Eilat, 41, the centre&apos;s director. &quot;We are living here like an island with no connection with our neighbours.&quot; &quot;We are trying to deal with different kinds of issues: terrorism, the war against terror and the image of the Arabs in western culture, which I think we adopt in Israel. We don&apos;t identify ourselves with Mediterranean countries or Middle Eastern countries but with America and European countries and with the west. &quot; Israel&apos;s war against Hizbullah in Lebanon last summer produced a rash of quick, pro-Israeli computer games that ridiculed the Islamic guerrilla force and its leader Hassan Nasrallah. In one of the games on show a photo of his face was put on top of a cartoon character&apos;s body that squawked like a chicken. The player had to drop objects on his head, including a toilet and a rocket with the Star of David on its side. But also on show was a much more sophisticated combat game called Special Force created in 2003 by a Hizbullah sympathiser. The game begins with a computer image of an Israeli tank being destroyed, and a picture of the Israeli flag being covered in boot prints and then going up in flames. &quot;May Allah&apos;s blessings and peace be upon you,&quot; says a message on one of the first screens. An early part of the player&apos;s mission in a shooting range requires him to fire at targets showing faces of Israeli politicians, including Ariel Sharon, the former prime minister, and Shaul Mofaz, the former defence minister. Hizbullah flags appear, and one of the group&apos;s anthems plays in the background.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-26T13:58:05Z", "title": "Rory McCarthy on a collection of computer games whose content is drawn directly from events that have shaped the Middle East", "sentences": ["The two games were among dozens gathered together recently at the Israeli Centre for Digital Art in Holon, near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/26/news.israel"}, {"tags": ["Politics", "Venezuela", "World news", "George Galloway", "Americas"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday March 5 2007   In the article below George Galloway stated that Denis MacShane MP, when a foreign office minister, welcomed the 2002 coup against Ch\u00e1vez as the &quot;overthrow of a demagogue&quot;. Mr MacShane has never uttered those words. In a Times article in April 2002 he described Ch\u00e1vez as &quot;a ranting, populist demagogue&quot;. However, in a government statement the day before the Times article was published, he had called for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.    The chilling Oliver Stone film Salvador got a rare airing on television this week. It was a reminder of a time when, for those on the left, little victories were increasingly dwarfed by big defeats - not least in a Latin America which became synonymous with death squads and juntas. How different things seem now. Yesterday US Vice-President Dick Cheney came uncomfortably close to the reality of Afghan resistance to foreign occupation. On the same day Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez delivered a mightier blow to the neocon dream of US domination, announcing an extension of public ownership of his country&apos;s oil fields - the richest outside the Middle East. Much more is at stake than London mayor Ken Livingstone&apos;s welcome oil deal with Ch\u00e1vez, which will see London bus fares halved while Venezuela gets expertise from city hall and a bridgehead in the capital of the US&apos;s viceroy in Europe. Washington&apos;s biggest oil supplier is now firmly in the grip of a social revolution. This month I watched with Ch\u00e1vez as thousands of soldiers, French and British tanks, Russian helicopters and brand new Mirage and Sukhoi fighter bombers passed by: the soldiers chanting &quot;patria, socialismo o muerte&quot; - enough to make any US president blanch. Ch\u00e1vez answered the salute with the words: &quot;the Bolivarian revolution is a peaceful revolution but it is not unarmed&quot;. The music played throughout the event was the hymn of Salvador Allende&apos;s 1970s Chilean government, declaring that the people united will never be defeated. But Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s socialism is a good deal more red than Allende&apos;s - and its enemies seem no less determined than those who bathed Chile in blood in 1973. Despite complete control of Venezuela&apos;s national assembly - the opposition boycotted the last elections after being defeated in seven electoral tests in a row - Ch\u00e1vez has been given enabling powers for 18 months to ensure he can pilot his reforms through entrenched opposition from the civil service, big business, the previously all-powerful oligarchy, their vast media interests and their friends in Washington. Among those friends we must include our own prime minister, who only last year declared Venezuela to be in breach of international democratic norms - though when I pressed him in parliament he was unable to list them. The atmosphere in Caracas is fervid. The vast shanty towns draping the hillside around the cosmopolitan centre bustle with workers&apos; cooperatives, trade union meetings, marches and debates. The $18bn fund for social welfare set up by Ch\u00e1vez is already bearing fruit. Education, food distribution and primary healthcare programmes now cover the majority for the first time. Queues form outside medical centres filled with thousands of Cuban doctors dispensing care to a population whose health was of no value to those who sat atop Venezuela&apos;s immense wealth in the past. Ch\u00e1vez, who regularly pops over to Havana to check on the health of Fidel Castro, is at the centre of a new Latin America which is determined to be nobody&apos;s backyard. Reliable US allies are now limited to death squad ridden Colombia, Peru and Mexico - and latterly then only by recourse to rigged elections. But Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s international ambitions are not confined to the Americas. He became a hero in the Arab world after withdrawing his ambassador from Tel Aviv in protest at the bombardment of Lebanon by US-armed Israeli forces last summer, and has pledged privately to halt oil exports to the US in the event of aggression against Iran. This all represents a challenge to US power which, if Bush was not sunk in the morass of Iraq, would be at the top of his action list. Not that his supporters are marking time. The mendacious propaganda that Ch\u00e1vez is a dictator and human rights abuser is being spread with increasing urgency by the Atlanticist right and their fellow travellers, such as leftie-turned-neocon Nick Cohen who told his London newspaper audience last week that Livingstone&apos;s relationship with Ch\u00e1vez was making him think of voting Tory. Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s decision not to renew an expired licence for an opposition television station involved in a coup attempt - there are plenty of others - is being portrayed as the beginning of the death of democracy. It&apos;s as if Country Life&apos;s diatribes against the fox hunting ban were taken as irrefutable proof of totalitarianism in Britain. The so-called &quot;dictator&quot; Ch\u00e1vez is nothing of the kind. He has won election after election, validating his radical course. Still the fear of a coup - such as in 2002 when Ch\u00e1vez was removed and imprisoned for three days before millions descended to the presidential palace to reinstate him - is everywhere. One Englishman abroad who welcomed the 2002 coup as the &quot;overthrow of a demagogue&quot; was the foreign office minister Denis MacShane - a humiliating correction had to be issued following Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s restoration. That tale underscores the importance of the links being forged between revolutionary Caracas and anti-war London. Ch\u00e1vez is well aware that the people were defeated in Chile, the fascists allowed to pass in Republican Spain. Just as in Venezuela, the defence against counter-revolution lies with the poor and the working people who are shaping the world they want; so too must all those internationally who want to see this ferment reach its potential rally to Venezuela&apos;s side. \u00b7 George Galloway is the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and presents a radio show three times a week on TalkSport Georgegalloway.com", "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T11:59:51Z", "title": "George Galloway: These orchestrated attacks on Ch\u00e1vez are a travesty", "sentences": ["He became a hero in the Arab world after withdrawing his ambassador from Tel Aviv in protest at the bombardment of Lebanon by US-armed Israeli forces last summer, and has pledged privately to halt oil exports to the US in the event of aggression against Iran."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/28/comment.politics"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "An undercover Israeli unit shot and killed two Islamic Jihad leaders and their driver in the West Bank town of Jenin today, triggering promises of revenge from the militant organisation. Elsewhere in the West Bank, around 50,000 people in the city of Nablus were put under curfew for the second time this week. Witnesses said the undercover officers shot at a vehicle in which the three men were sitting from a black car. The army said troops had tried to arrest Ashraf Saadi, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad, in a hospital car park, but he had opened fire on them. When Saadi fled, continuing to fire, the troops shot him dead, the army said, adding that one Israeli had been slightly wounded by gunfire. Army officials claimed the shot men had helped plan a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last week, but said the attack had been thwarted. An Islamic Jihad official in the West Bank said the other dead men were Mohammed Abu Naaseh, one of its leaders in the Jenin area, and Ala al-Breiky, who did not belong to the group but was driving the vehicle, Reuters reported. In the Gaza Strip, Abu Ahmad, an Islamic Jihad spokesman, said the group would retaliate. &quot;This new crime will not pass without tough punishment,&quot; he added. Hamas also vowed revenge for the shootings. Islamic Jihad, which receives backing from Iran and Syria, has carried out dozens of suicide bombs and rocket attacks against Israel. In Nablus, dozens of jeeps, backed by bulldozers, raided the city, imposing a curfew on tens of thousands of Palestinians for the second time this week as the army carried out raids against suspected militants. Troops had withdrawn yesterday, briefly stopping a three-day operation, but moved back in at dawn today, witnesses said. At least three bulldozers sealed off all entrances to the Old City, an area of narrow alleyways and cramped blocks of flats, with rubble and large concrete blocks. Jeeps patrolled much of the city to reinstate the curfew, military officials said, with more than 50,000 people being confined to their homes. The operation in Nablus is the largest in the West Bank for months. Israel has frequently used such operations in an attempt to crush militant activity and thwart suicide bombings. The Israeli army claims most of the suicide bombers in attempted attacks during 2006 came from the Nablus area. Five suspects were arrested in house to house searches for militants, army officials said. One Palestinian has so far been killed in the operation, which began on Sunday, and three explosives labs have been uncovered. The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, accused Israel of trying to undermine Palestinian efforts to form a new unity government. Mr Haniyeh&apos;s Hamas party and the rival Fatah movement are trying to finalise a power-sharing deal, reached in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, that aims to halt months of fighting. &quot;It&apos;s clear that this Israeli escalation ... is tied directly to Israel&apos;s rejection of the Mecca agreement, which strengthened national unity,&quot; Mr Haniyeh, speaking in the Gaza Strip, said. Meanwhile, Israeli police in Jerusalem blocked a news conference called by Muslim and Christian leaders opposing Israeli excavation work near a holy site. Police delivered a cancellation order at the east Jerusalem hotel where the event had been scheduled to take place, saying the news conference was organised by Hamas, considered by Israel to be a terrorist group. The event was scheduled by the al-Aqsa Foundation, which Israel believes is tied to Hamas, although organisers deny the allegation. Later, the foundation moved the event to another hotel, but police moved in and broke it up without incident. &quot;We strongly condemn this childish behaviour,&quot; Sheik Raed Salah, a leader of the Israeli Islamic Movement and organiser of the event, said. &quot;This behaviour does not protect security. It actually makes the security situation explosive.&quot; The press conference was also attended by Archmandrite Atallah Hannah, a Greek Orthodox Church official, and the Jerusalem Mufti, Mohammed Hussein. The hilltop holy site - home to the al-Aqsa mosque and the gold-capped Dome of the Rock - is Islam&apos;s third-holiest shrine, and the dig has inflamed Muslim fears that Israel is planning to damage it. It also is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews have gathered for centuries to pray outside the compound at the Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient compound. Israel says the dig is intended to salvage archaeological finds prior to the construction of a new pedestrian walkway up to the hilltop compound, and Israeli archaeologists insist there is no danger to the site.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T12:48:00Z", "title": "Israeli officers kill Islamic Jihad leaders", "sentences": ["Army officials claimed the shot men had helped plan a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last week, but said the attack had been thwarted."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/28/israel1"}, {"tags": ["World news"], "article": "20 new species of sharks and rays found at markets Twenty new species of sharks and rays have been discovered in Indonesia during a survey of catches at local fish markets, Australian researchers said yesterday.

This must be how Thierry Henry felt on Sunday, I thought, as he watched Arsenal in the cup final - and it ain&apos;t easy. And, I suppose, Sunday also affected me in the same way. En masse, we descended on the bar, decked out in our Arsenal finery and ready for war. Our devotion had sent us all the way to Tel Aviv, location of the only pub with an illegal satellite for showing the game. Walking in, we swapped the balmy Israeli evening for a more familiar scene. There, bathed in smoke and swimming in Stella, sat 200 Brits, clad in their colours and eyes glued to the projector screen. This was the closest we&apos;d get to being part of the event - 1,000 miles away in body, but our spirits back in the bars and pubs of our youth. (But, even as we sang our hearts out and wound up the opposing fans, there was one crucial thing missing. Where were the goyim? Back home, we used to know our place - joining in the singing if it had already begun, but never being so brave as to start it ourselves. Afterwards, I likened the experience to what it would be like if you took the lions out of the Sahara. The gazelles would run riot, freed from the mental shackles of worry and, it struck me, we were the gazelles - aping those whose position we&apos;d always aspired to occupy.) The final whistle went, heralding not only Arsenal&apos;s defeat, but also our switching back to Israeli mode. As we trudged outside, we passed the Uzi-sporting guard on the door and the plaque on the wall honouring the victims of a bombing at the pub years before. We climbed into a taxi, manned by the type of driver whom we all know (but don&apos;t love) from the black cabs of London town. Upon clocking that we were all new to the country, he offered us some of his expert advice about - surprise, surprise - the &quot;Arab problem&quot;. Whereas I used to treat the casual racism of London cabbies as almost benign and insincere, when I hear the same thing here, I immediately pay close attention and scan the rhetoric for deeper meaning. Because, to me, the &quot;bloody immigrants&quot; ranting of an Ilford 50-year-old is nowhere near as potent as the declaration of a post-army sabra that &quot;You can&apos;t trust any Arab. They&apos;re all out to kill us - believe me, I know&quot;. These people live, breathe, and take up arms for, the cause - and now, as an Israeli myself, they think it&apos;s incumbent on me to do the same. But I don&apos;t want to. At least, not 24 hours a day. I didn&apos;t grow up like this, I didn&apos;t have elder siblings guarding checkpoints while I did my maths homework. The violence of the intifadas was always in Technicolor, not in my face as I headed home from work. Walking the City streets, I only scanned pedestrians&apos; clothes for their labels (are they Cox loafers or Gucci?), whereas now I find myself wondering if that guy&apos;s coat is bulging because of the wind, or because there&apos;s gelignite strapped to his midriff. And it does my head in. Casual days lazing in the sunshine on Hampstead Heath can&apos;t be repeated as nonchalantly here. Try doing the same thing in Gan Haatzmaut (Independence Park) in Jerusalem, and within minutes, nervous guards from the American Consulate stalk over to check you out, in case you&apos;re scoping their building for a possible attack. The quickest routes from A to B are often the ones that no one takes. You could get from Jerusalem to Beer Sheva in an hour and a half, if you drove through the West Bank, but barely anyone does. Instead, they sit and sweat their way through a three hour trip that stays well within the Green Line - sacrificing a swift journey for the feeling of security that the longer route brings. There are plus sides, too, of course. There is almost no street crime - I&apos;ve not got a single friend who&apos;s been mugged, even walking home at four in the morning. But the reason for that is not because everyone sticks to the &quot;Love thy neighbour&quot; commandment. It&apos;s because potential muggers have no idea whom they&apos;re taking on - everyone&apos;s been in the army, so, for all the robber knows, the scrawny man coming towards him was actually in special forces and could repel an attack by ten men. And the feelings of insecurity that nag at passengers on the bus are dispelled as soon as they get inside the mall, restaurant or shop they were heading for, thanks to the armed guards on every entrance. What outsiders see as a tragic sign of what life in Israel&apos;s become for its citizens, Israelis themselves actually take much comfort from. Knowing that the only way an attacker can get to you is past the pistol-packing Russian on the door actually makes an afternoon meal that much more stress-free. But, ultimately, the &quot;situation&quot; is on everyone&apos;s mind at all times, if not on everyone&apos;s lips. No one walks past a Palestinian on the street without automatically checking them for signs of a threat. No one boards a bus without the thought flickering through their mind that this could be a fateful trip. No one can walk more than 100 yards without seeing a soldier, and being reminded that it could be their own flesh-and-blood next to take a bullet on some windswept plain in the Judean valley. And so it goes on. Israelis always ask, &quot;Why on earth are you here? Why would you want to live like this, all day, every day?&quot; But the truth is, the grass isn&apos;t always greener on the other side. (Unless you ask my stoner mates, whose main problem with this country is that nothing they can purchase here will ever match the grass they could score in the motherland.) No - for all its intensity, life out here makes us feel alive in a way that the cushioned, easy existence we grew up with in London never could. It&apos;s a challenge, it&apos;s high-octane, and it&apos;s more mentally stimulating than a lifetime of trading equities in some City ivory tower ever could be.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-06T10:30:00Z", "title": "Trading places", "sentences": ["Our devotion had sent us all the way to Tel Aviv, location of the only pub with an illegal satellite for showing the game."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/06/andthebrightlightsof"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "The Football Association are trying to ensure a bumper turn-out at the first game to be played at the new Wembley Stadium by pricing tickets for the England Under-21s&apos; match against Italy on 24 March at just \u00a310, roughly half the normal price. Fans eager to see the stunning \u00a3775m venue at first hand will be able to buy tickets from noon tomorrow, and FA officials are expecting the game to become a 60,000 sell-out very quickly. The match will act as the second of the two &apos;ramp-up&apos; events that the FA is legally obliged to stage at Wembley before Brent Council will award it the safety certificate it requires so that the FA Cup final, due to be played on 19 May, can be confirmed. The first, on Saturday, is a &apos;community day&apos; for local residents, but tickets have all gone. The game will kick off at 12.30pm so that fans can get home in plenty of time to watch the England senior team&apos;s Euro 2008 Group E qualifier, against Israel in Tel Aviv, at 6.30pm. With Stuart Pearce unavailable to act as the Under-21s coach for the game at Manchester City&apos;s insistence, his assistant Nigel Pearson - who once managed Carlisle United and acted as West Brom&apos;s caretaker-manager earlier this season - will have the honour of being the first England manager to lead out a team at the rebuilt venue. Having finally received the keys to the new stadium on Friday night, 14 months late, the FA are now finalising details of a series of concerts to be held at English football&apos;s new home over the summer in order to bring in some much-needed revenue. George Michael has been confirmed for 9 June, but talks are ongoing with other top acts. England&apos;s first game at Wembley may be a friendly against either Brazil or Argentina on 30 May. Their first competitive match will not be until their return qualifier against Israel on 8 September. Chelsea&apos;s potential Premiership title decider with Manchester United is highly likely to be played on Wednesday 9 May, giving Sky TV a huge live event four days before the league season ends. The reigning champions are due to face the current leaders at Stamford Bridge on Sunday 15 April. But if either is in the last four of the FA Cup the league game will have to be moved, as the semi-finals are scheduled for that weekend. The two teams&apos; success in reaching the last eight of the Champions League means both now have to rearrange their league matches scheduled for on or just after the Easter weekend, as the second legs of the competition&apos;s quarter-finals will be played on Tuesday 10 and Wednesday 11 April. That means that Chelsea&apos;s trip to West Ham on 9 April, Liverpool&apos;s game with Middlesbrough the same day and United&apos;s home fixture with Sheffield United the day after will switch, in order to accommodate their ties with Valencia, PSV Eindhoven and Roma respectively. With free potential match slots before the end of the season few and far between, and rearranging the postponed Easter league games a more pressing priority than finding a new date for Chelsea v Manchester United, 9 May is looking highly likely to be chosen. Arsenal, chasing at least a fourth-place finish after their exit from the Champions League last week to PSV, are likely to have their crucial home match with Chelsea moved from Saturday 5 May to the day after at 4pm for screening on Sky. They are also trying to find a date on which to stage an outstanding league game with Manchester City that has already been postponed three times.

Manchester United supporters are not exactly famous for worrying about England in any case and neutrals will know better than to expect excitement from Tel Aviv on Saturday week. Middlesbrough went a goal down, recovered to take a 2-1 lead, then were denied their day of glory when a penalty was harshly awarded against them. This was another lucky escape for United in other words, who remain on course for a possible Treble despite losing players and their form of a few months ago. However, their injury problems are deepening on a daily basis. Edwin van der Sar had to cry off with a calf strain sustained while warming up, so Tomasz Kuszczak was hastily promoted from the bench and Chris Eagles sent to sit with the substitutes, leaving the visitors without a recognised goalkeeper in reserve. Kuszczak was in action straight away, making a save to deny Stewart Downing after the England winger&apos;s run behind the United defence had been superbly picked out by an inch-perfect pass from Julio Arca. On the ground where he won a highly contentious penalty in the league three months ago, Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s every touch brought resounding boos, treatment that merely encouraged the winger to increase the quotient of dummies and step-overs. This in turn resulted in him being clattered by a combination of Lee Cattermole and Stuart Parnaby, though it was the confusion caused by Ronaldo swapping from the right wing to the left - as advertised by a song from United&apos;s travelling support - that led to the opening goal. Gabriel Heinze did well to tidy up in defence after Nemanja Vidic was nearly caught out, and even better to continue his run to launch an attack. Boro had no one marking Ryan Giggs when he popped up in the middle, and when he played a simple ball forward to Wayne Rooney instead of the expected one out to Ronaldo, the defence continued to stand off until it was far too late and the striker&apos;s crisply struck shot was nestling in Mark Schwarzer&apos;s bottom right corner. That was the signal for United to relax and gradually assume control, or it should have been. They almost increased their lead when a Giggs volley struck the base of a post, though they were once again indebted to Kuszczak for a fine one-handed save when Yakubu turned smartly from a throw-in and produced a shot on target from just inside the box. Boro were not doing much attacking, but that was a reminder of their potency in front of goal. When Rio Ferdinand and Kuszczak went for the same Downing cross on the stroke of the interval, the centre-half reaching the ball but leaving his goalkeeper stranded, Boro knew exactly how to take advantage. Arca headed the ball back into the danger area for Cattermole to control, turn and shoot in the same movement, finding the empty net with Kuszczak still trying to get back into position. If an equaliser was not what United wanted to see, neither was Henrik Larsson marking his last game for the club with a booking for diving just before half time. Whatever Sir Alex Ferguson said in the dressing room was redundant 90 seconds into the second half, because that was all the time it took for Boro to take the lead. Downing did a decent impersonation of Ronaldo by winning a corner with a cross from the left, then turning up to take it from the right. In both cases the delivery was excellent, with Kuszczak forced to flap at the first one and the second floating over an entire six-yard box full of defenders and landing square on the forehead of the completely unmarked George Boateng at the far post. As with Boro&apos;s first goal, questions could be asked about United&apos;s organisation at the back, but this time there was no question of the substitute goalkeeper being to blame. For a good 10 minutes the Treble was off, United were not going to grace the new Wembley and Gareth Southgate could be safely crossed off the list of managers worried about where Sven-Goran Eriksson might be turning up next. Then, for the second Saturday in succession, fortune smiled on &apos;lucky United&apos; (copyright J Mourinho). To be more accurate fate turned its back on Boateng, who could consider himself decidedly unlucky to concede a penalty for handball. Rob Styles, the referee, was right on the spot when Giggs swung over a corner and will doubtless argue there was contact and intent need not come into it, but Boateng could hardly even have seen the ball coming as Ferdinand was standing right in front of him before ducking down at the last minute to attempt a back header. Ronaldo cemented his lasting unpopularity in these parts by gratefully accepting the opportunity to score from the spot. Mark Viduka and Yakubu had chances before the end, but United were not going to slip up three times. Boro will do well to get as close at Old Trafford.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-11T22:59:30Z", "title": "FA Cup: Middlesborough 2 - 2 Manchester United", "sentences": ["Manchester United supporters are not exactly famous for worrying about England in any case and neutrals will know better than to expect excitement from Tel Aviv on Saturday week."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/11/match.manchesterunited"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is planning to respond in person to intensifying international pressure over his country&apos;s controversial nuclear programme by taking his case directly to the United Nations security council in New York, it emerged yesterday. Mr Ahmadinejad wanted to &quot;defend the rights of the Iranian nation in exploiting peaceful nuclear energy,&quot; state TV quoted the Iranian government spokesman, Gholam Hossein Elham, as saying. The president would attend if the security council holds a meeting on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, the TV said. South Africa&apos;s ambassador, Dumisani Kumalo, whose country holds the council&apos;s rotating presidency, said that if Mr Ahmadinejad made a formal request, &quot;it would be very difficult to deny him that opportunity&quot;. The US said it was not aware that any such request had been made. Western countries, led by the US, insist that Iran&apos;s nuclear programme is a covert attempt to produce atomic weapons, a view reinforced by Tehran&apos;s continuing refusal to freeze uranium enrichment. Diplomatic efforts are under way to agree new UN sanctions to force it to comply. The sensitivity of the issue is highlighted in a report today by a leading British foreign affairs think-tank warning that Israel - with its own large but undeclared nuclear arsenal - faces &quot;dire and far-reaching consequences&quot; if it takes military action against the Iranian programme. Israeli airstrikes were possible, though &quot;extremely risky&quot;, and Iran could retaliate with massive ballistic missile attacks on cities such as Tel Aviv or Haifa with &quot;substantial&quot; loss of life, says Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House&apos;s Middle East programme. &quot;An Israeli military operation against Iran would hurt Israel&apos;s long-term interests. It would be detrimental to Israel&apos;s overall security and the political and economic consequences would be dire and far-reaching,&quot; the report said. But it warned too that the Israelis may feel compelled to act if they believed Tehran was close to developing a nuclear bomb. &quot;Any military operation against Iran, as well as involving many casualties, would enhance the appeal of extremism in the Muslim world, inside and outside Iran, at the expense of the moderates.&quot; If diplomacy failed, the report proposes that Israel could move to a policy of deterrence by openly declaring its own nuclear capability, mirroring the &quot;balance of terror&quot; that kept the peace between the west and the Soviet bloc in the cold war. In Dubai, the French foreign minister Phillippe Douste-Blazy agreed that military action would destabilise the region and insisted that sanctions would have to be imposed on Iran. Last December the security council imposed sanctions including a ban on the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology and threatened further measures if Iran failed to suspend enrichment. The five permanent council members plus Germany are now consulting on new proposals including a travel ban, an expanded list of people, organisations and companies subject to an asset freeze - including the Revolutionary Guards and the state-owned Bank Sepah - as well as an arms embargo and trade restrictions. Russia and China, however, have strong reservations, and any decision needs a consensus . In a related development, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, yesterday met the Iranian defence minister, Mostafa Najjar, to discuss military links between the two countries. Syria is Iran&apos;s only Arab ally at a time of deepening confrontation between Arab states and Tehran. The two countries both support the Lebanese movement Hizbullah and the Palestinian Hamas while Iran has close links to Shia parties in Iraq. Syria has been improving its arsenal since last summer&apos;s war between Hizbullah and Israel while Iran has been upgrading its military capabilities.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-12T00:09:54Z", "title": "Iran to take nuclear case directly to UN", "sentences": ["Israeli airstrikes were possible, though &quot;extremely risky&quot;, and Iran could retaliate with massive ballistic missile attacks on cities such as Tel Aviv or Haifa with &quot;substantial&quot; loss of life, says Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House&apos;s Middle East programme."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/12/iran.ianblack"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea"], "article": "Martin Jol muttered the word &quot;horrendous&quot; when asked about his side&apos;s impending fixture pile-up here, though consternation at the clutter ahead will not only be troubling club managers. Steve McClaren must have watched this weekend&apos;s sixth-round replays reach parity, with consequent replays next Monday, with a sense of dread. Yet again, the national coach&apos;s prospects could be undermined, with his squad hampered by weary limbs when England travel to Israel next Thursday. This thrilling draw left the likes of John Terry, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Aaron Lennon and Jermain Defoe facing the prospect of playing their replay at White Hart Lane on Monday just two days before the national squad meet up for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel - for which Ashley Cole is suspended - and Andorra. Added to the contingents from Manchester United and Middlesbrough and with other injuries taken into account, that could leave McClaren sweating over the fitness of up to 16 of his squad just hours ahead of the awkward game in Tel Aviv. That will hardly lend itself to smooth preparations for critical games given England&apos;s sloppy start to their qualification campaign even if Terry, England&apos;s captain, retains hopes of proving his own fitness in competitive action ahead of the international fixtures. As Terry continues his rehabilitation from the concussion sustained at the Carling Cup final last month, he is hopeful of featuring either against Manchester City on Wednesday, Sheffield United at the weekend or Spurs next week. In the talisman&apos;s absence here, Jose Mourinho admitted his side had been distinctly fragile defensively in shipping three goals for the first time at home during his tenure, though the Chelsea manager is unperturbed by suggestions that talks over a new contract for his captain at Stamford Bridge have broken down. &quot;He has a long-term contract,&quot; insisted the Portuguese. &quot;It&apos;s until 2009. He&apos;s a Chelsea player until then, minimum. We had hoped to have him signed recently [after the Carling Cup semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers earlier this year], but something happened and they didn&apos;t [sign]. &quot;It&apos;s better if he has a contract until 2015. Better for him and better for Chelsea. But if he has one to 2009 and he takes one, two or three more months before they [Terry and his representatives] sign it, I don&apos;t see a problem. If that&apos;s what it takes, then there&apos;ll be no drama. We made defensive mistakes today, but the game was magnificent, the spirit was great. At half-time, we were out of the competition.&quot; They might have been jettisoned permanently when the excellent Lennon, fed by Dimitar Berbatov&apos;s fine pass, raced clear of a ragged home back line only for Petr Cech to block the midfielder&apos;s attempt. Such vulnerability was typical of Chelsea&apos;s display, with Michael Essien uncomfortable against Berbatov&apos;s clever running, and Paulo Ferreira labouring and withdrawn just after the half-hour mark. Tottenham were rampant before the break, searing through illustrious opponents almost at will, with this ultimately a missed opportunity to end a winless sequence in these parts which stretches back to 1990. By the end, Mourinho&apos;s frantic desire to avoid a replay had left him with only two recognised defenders on the pitch - and one of them the out-of-favour Khalid Boulahrouz - with Spurs striking the bar through Defoe in the closing minutes. &quot;We survived, so we have another game to play,&quot; added Mourinho. &quot;In this moment, we are happier than them because they had everything in their hands and we&apos;d lost it all, but every game is a new story. &quot;Is this my last chance to win an FA Cup? This game was the last chance to win it this season because at half-time we were out. But I hope to have three more chances to win this FA Cup.

While the Mecca accords were a positive achievement, if only because it prompted the Fatah/Hamas civil conflict ceasefire; there are numerous, far deeper implications to be considered, which suggest a thorny future for the entire region if the Saudis blindly follow US prompts. The latter part of the 20th century is scattered with examples of the US employing the maxim &quot;my enemy&apos;s enemy is my friend&quot;, where millions of dollars and military expertise was utilised to aid those who would oppose the Kremlin and its influence. The history books show that in the 1950s, Muhammad Reza, Shah of Iran, was assisted in overthrowing the democratically elected prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq. In the 1970s, the Mujahadeen of Afghanistan were trained by American special forces, which sealed the Afghan victory over the Soviet invaders. Egypt began to enjoy the largess only after Anwar Sadat kicked out the Soviets in the 70s, signed a peace treaty with Israel and most importantly, disenfranchised the Islamists within its borders. This marked the emergence of the new bogeyman replacing the commies. Egypt, once recognised as the Umm Ad-Dunya or &quot;the mother of the world&quot; for being a global pioneer, has been relegated to the poor man of the Middle East, both economically and politically, since its unwavering commitment to the US began with Camp David and the subsequent unilateral peace deal with Israel. Egypt&apos;s poor economic state persists despite receiving nearly $2bn a year in military and economic aid from the US since 1979. Egypt&apos;s self-interested peace with Israel has meant it has been divorced from the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis and thus has little or no credible political, diplomatic or military influence on the matter. There is little doubt that Egypt&apos;s current position has been the result of careful choreography by the US. Once again, in the interest of counterbalancing the players in the region we now see the rise of the Saudis. Privately, the Saudi monarch has always been close with the US and even closer with the Bush dynasty. The Saudi role in bringing together the warring Fatah and Hamas factions and the simultaneous promise to aid Hamas without an audible whimper from the US is an indication that these events are being orchestrated by Washington, which means there must be tacit Israeli approval. With the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni calling on European leaders not to be in a hurry to accept the Mecca accord and with the absence of protestation from Tel Aviv against Saudi financial support of &quot;Hamas terrorists&quot;, one has to be suspicious about the motives of these parties behind closed doors. In the background, there are rumours which began in September 2006 when the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, had held a secret meeting with a senior Saudi official, perhaps King Abdullah himself. Both Olmert and the Saudis denied any such contact but Ha&apos;aretz later clarified from its sources that Prince Bandar, secretary general of the Saudi Arabian national security council and former Saudi ambassador to the United States, was most likely the senior official at the centre of the reports of contacts between Riyadh and Israel. The purpose or course of any such meeting remains unclear. However, it is apparent that the Iranian public support for Hamas; the rise of Shias in Iraq and Hizbullah&apos;s victory over Israel in the summer 2006; have all built up to the current propelling of Saudi Arabia as the broker of peace. It is clear that this counterbalances the growing Iranian influence in the region, which is understood and feared most by Israel. As it stands, the Saudis do not command a similar respect without such intervention and stage management from the outside. The Saudis are possibly being exploited on two fronts. First, the recent exceptional visit by Iran&apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with King Abdullah has been trumpeted as an initiative to fight sectarian Sunni-Shia strife in the Middle East. However, the additional use of this meeting to exert diplomatic pressure on Tehran to suspend its uranium enrichment programme, on the behest of the US, cannot be ruled out. This seems especially paramount on the back of Condoleezza Rice&apos;s meeting with a host of Arab intelligence chiefs spanning Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in Amman on 23 February. Despite these secondary motives, it is the Saudis&apos; role in the Palestinian affair that is most concerning, not only for the Palestinians themselves but for the Saudis and the US as well. It is expected that King Abdullah will call a summit for the end of March. On the agenda will be the resurrection of &quot;the Arab Peace Initiative&quot; and Israel has already given it a diplomatic green light. On Israel&apos;s Channel 10, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said, &quot;A new summit is in the offing, and they ought to know which parts [of the plan] are acceptable to Israel and what seems to us like an absolute red line&quot;. She further added that the original draft presented by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was, in her view, &quot;positive&quot;, this has also been confirmed by Olmert. This original draft refers to a peace deal without Israel having to implement UN Resolution 194, which calls for the right of return of the Palestinian refugees. A flurry of diplomatic interchanges is preceding the Riyadh summit and Prime Minister Olmert has promised to hold a meeting with Abbas, and Livni to meet with European foreign ministers. The poison in the chalice for the Saudis lies in the fact they may be dragged publicly into negotiations with Israel and end up recognising Israel, as Israel has demanded and as Egypt has done, but fail to secure a Palestinian state and peace. This would lead the Saudis down Egypt&apos;s path, and thus result in even further marginalisation by its own people and by the Arab/Muslim world. For the US, the Saudis may be their last hope to achieve their vision for the region, and failure in this, which is guaranteed in the absence of the right of return for the Palestinians, may provide Iran with what the Saudis were propped up to control - the centre of political gravity in the region.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-12T09:02:00Z", "title": "Reaching the summit", "sentences": ["With the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni calling on European leaders not to be in a hurry to accept the Mecca accord and with the absence of protestation from Tel Aviv against Saudi financial support of &quot;Hamas terrorists&quot;, one has to be suspicious about the motives of these parties behind closed doors."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/12/diplomaticmanoeuvresinthed"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "As an Israeli ambassador, Tsuriel Raphael was accomplished at putting a gloss on delicate subjects, be it Tel Aviv&apos;s nuclear programme, the treatment of Palestinians or the invasion of Lebanon.

The Preston striker was listed yesterday in the party for an Under-21 friendly with Italy at Wembley on the same day, but there is a distinct possibility that he will have been promoted to the senior ranks by the start of next week. Nugent would owe that opportunity to restricted means in the forward line. Steve McClaren&apos;s intention is to name Wayne Rooney, Andrew Johnson, Jermain Defoe and Darren Bent in a 23-man squad tomorrow for the fixtures against Israel and, four days later, Andorra. The head coach, however, is uneasy about Bent&apos;s fitness. The Charlton player is feeling the after-effects of a knee injury and he will have to be assessed following the match against Newcastle on Sunday. Should he be unavailable, England will look to Nugent. With Peter Crouch out of contention after surgery on his broken nose, the 21-year-old has come to the fore. McClaren was at Deepdale on Tuesday to watch Nugent in the 1-0 victory over Ipswich, for whom he has 15 goals this season. At left-back, with Wayne Bridge lost to knee surgery and Ashley Cole suspended for the Israel game, he has Phil Neville and Jamie Carragher for the left-back vacancy. The latter has flourished for Liverpool of late in high-profile matches. &quot;This is a big game and, I believe, a game for experience,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;The likes of Neville and Carragher are certainly capable of filling that breach. I&apos;m delighted with the form of Carragher. In the Manchester United and Barcelona games those were fantastic performances. Carragher is one of those unsung heroes at a club, somebody whom every team needs. He&apos;s very conscientious, very professional and a great character.&quot; Defeat by Spain last month, when the similarly right-footed Phil Neville was at left-back, showed how lop-sided England can look. McClaren seems intent on using a 4-4-2 formation in Israel and feels that he can achieve balance by stationing someone wide on the left of midfield, even if the player is right-footed. Aaron Lennon is just such a person and, in the wake of Tottenham&apos;s 3-3 draw at Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final, the manager finds it hard to ignore him for the vacancy on the left. &quot;That has been a problem area since Joe Cole got his injury,&quot; said McClaren, &quot;but we&apos;ve got options there. We&apos;ve seen Aaron Lennon, who can play right side and has played left side quite regularly. On Sunday [against Chelsea] he gave a great performance at the head of a diamond. &quot;He&apos;s somebody who came into the World Cup, excited us from day one and played a cameo part in some games. Unfortunately, because of injuries and illness, we haven&apos;t seen him as often as we would like. Lennon has that experience of a World Cup so I would have no hesitation about putting him in, but he&apos;s still got a long way to go. &quot;But I&apos;ve also been impressed with Kieron Dyer and in the Spain game he was one of the pluses. He&apos;s a possibility. As is Stewart Downing, who&apos;s coming into form with Middlesbrough and who gives you that natural balance as a left-footer.&quot; In some respects, McClaren may feel better-equipped than he was for England&apos;s last away match in the qualifiers, the 2-0 defeat by Croatia. Owen Hargreaves, now recovered from a broken leg, is considered by the manager to be ideal to complement Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. Joey Barton, who made his England debut last month, could lose his place in the squad. With Chelsea, Spurs, Manchester United and Middlesbrough all playing two games in three days over the weekend, because of FA Cup replays, 14 players will be at risk and even if they come through they will be in no condition to undergo prolonged preparations with England. McClaren believes the one chance for a detailed training session will come next Thursday, before the squad set off for Tel Aviv. Experimentation is a virtual impossibility and it is expected that the 4-4-2 will be adopted because of its familiarity. The manager himself would be reassured to see the captain, John Terry, in place, after injury as well as the serious concussion suffered in the Carling Cup final. McClaren calling for &quot;English aggression&quot; in Tel Aviv, said, &quot;he epitomises that. To have him out there would be a massive boost. He has the same effect with England that he does with Chelsea. &quot;In the dressing room we need to look each other in the eye and know that we trust each other. In every qualification [campaign] there have been bad results and doubts. When our backs are against the wall that&apos;s when our big players have got to do it.

European football&apos;s governing body said yesterday that it was awaiting a report from Ulrich Grzella, the security adviser on duty at Wednesday&apos;s match, before deciding how to proceed but an inquiry into fighting between Rangers supporters and riot police appears inevitable. A European ban is highly unlikely but it is conceivable that Uefa will fine Rangers heavily or order them to play European matches with sections of Ibrox closed, if the club are blamed for the fighting. The trouble flared in a corner of the ground populated by travelling fans, after more than double Rangers&apos; official allocation of 1,400 ticket-holders gained access to the Reyno de Navarro Stadium, a situation Rangers feel the Spaniards allowed to happen too easily. Grzella, a police officer, had been sent to the match in Pamplona after the potential for disorder was made clear to Uefa before the game. He has since received official complaints from the Glasgow club regarding the treatment of their supporters. Rangers were fined \u00a313,000 by Uefa 12 months ago after their fans were found guilty of singing discriminatory songs against Catholics, behaviour which came to a head in Spain during a Champions League match against Villarreal. Though Uefa has stressed that Wednesday&apos;s events are a separate case, the fact that the conduct of Rangers supporters abroad has come under scrutiny for the third time within a year - they were cleared of making Nazi salutes during a match in Tel Aviv last month - is an embarrassment for a club who have worked hard to eliminate abusive and sectarian behaviour. Rangers were given a five-year probation period as a result of the Villarreal inquiry, with Uefa warning that &quot;recidivism&quot; - repeat offending - would see the punishment handed out rise to the potential maximum of a European ban. That ultimate sanction appears highly unlikely, but with such a potential punishment in mind Rangers have taken a robust approach to the affair. Officials have hit out at what they perceive to be heavy-handed policing and their defence of any forthcoming case will be helped by the fact that they have a copy of a letter sent by Marc Timmer, Uefa&apos;s head of stadiums and security, to Osasuna in advance of the match, pointing out that it was the Spaniards&apos; responsibility to ensure adequate segregation and safety in the stadium. Martin Bain, the Rangers chief executive, claims Osasuna have &quot;let down&quot; themselves and Uefa. A Rangers statement added that written submissions would be made immediately to Uefa on behalf of aggrieved supporters. Yet other teams have travelled to Pamplona on European business without the sort of fighting that overshadowed Rangers&apos; visit and there is no history of violent disorder at the stadium. Bain admitted that a troublesome element was present among the visiting support. That was a clear reference to the Inter City Firm, a known hooligan group who attach themselves to Rangers and whose flag was present where violence flared. The scene in a corner of the ground degenerated within minutes of the second half getting under way amid brawling both between supporters and with riot police - who adopted a fierce approach - ensuring an area of the stand was cleared. The governing body must now decide how to investigate. With tickets for the match readily available to Scottish supporters throughout Pamplona until kick-off, the home club&apos;s ticketing arrangements are sure to warrant at least a light punishment, as was issued to Villarreal a year ago. Rangers will be helped by the fact that there was little or no disorder in the area where their official ticket-holders were situated, but the high level of drunkenness among the visiting following may also be considered by the authorities. Track record Barcelona, May 1972  Rangers manager Willie Waddell labels fans &apos;louts and hooligans&apos; when they invade the Camp Nou pitch after winning the Cup-Winners&apos; Cup against Dynamo Moscow. Rangers got a one-year European ban. Ibrox, December 2005 A Rangers fan runs on the pitch to celebrate Peter Lovenkrands&apos; goal in a 1-1 draw with Inter (\u00a32,000 fine).

Despite not being any more ineffective than the rest of the team in the recent friendly defeat to Spain, neither man has made McClaren&apos;s squad for England&apos;s first competitive fixture since the inglorious loss to Croatia in October. Barry&apos;s omission in particular is a slight surprise in the 23-man squad, given Ashley Cole - who is selected - is suspended for the Israel encounter and his regular left-back deputy, Wayne Bridge, is injured. McClaren confirmed Jamie Carragher and Phil Neville are battling for the defensive berth from a squad where 13 players are due to play twice in 48 hours over the weekend, culminating in FA Cup quarter-final replays on Monday. McClaren has already joked he will be watching the replays &quot;with his eyes closed&quot; fearing the damage the extra fixtures could cause to his planning. Having slipped to third spot in Group E, England need to pick up at least a point in Tel Aviv to ease the pressure on McClaren and retain a realistic hope of reaching next summer&apos;s finals in Austria and Switzerland. Of the line-up which started against Spain at Old Trafford, only four players are likely to keep their place when England look to follow Croatia&apos;s lead by beating Israel on their home turf. Peter Crouch is injured and Shaun Wright-Phillips has been given the boot, although given his lack of first-team appearances at Chelsea, it is surprising the winger was picked at all. Michael Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate, Kieron Dyer and Ben Foster can expect places on the bench at best, unless McClaren thinking dramatically alters over the next week. Spurs goalkeeper Paul Robinson has already been guaranteed a recall, while his White Hart Lane team-mate, Aaron Lennon, seems certain to occupy the left-sided spot in a four-man midfield which will see Steven Gerrard start on the right. Rather than inhibit the Liverpool skipper, McClaren feels the move offers Gerrard the freedom to attack, especially now Owen Hargreaves is back to patrol behind him.

Marked by their brevity, the stories can veer from the mundane to the surreal within a couple of pages, with shafts of humour and macabre eruptions of violence. A hip, urban fabulist with an untethered imagination, Keret focuses on small personal dilemmas and intimacies while mirroring the malaise and paranoia of a society braced for violence. In &quot;Hat Trick&quot;, a children&apos;s magician reaches for a rabbit in a hat, only to pull out the bunny&apos;s severed head, then a dead baby, to the ghoulish delight of his young audience. The tale appears in a new collection, Missing Kissinger, published this month. In the title story, an unassuming man longs for mediation between voraciously possessive women. For Keret, Israeli society reveals the &quot;human condition pushed to the extreme&quot;, where &quot;small irritations can erupt in aggression or violence. Everywhere has a sewage system, but in Israel it overflows.&quot; For many people, he says, &quot;it can be overwhelming, but for the writer it&apos;s like experiencing life at a louder volume.&quot; As well as collaborating on graphic books, Keret is a film-maker whose Malka Lev Adom (Skin Deep) won an Israeli academy award in 1996 and praise at festivals abroad. The mordant sketches he produced as a TV satirist led to his being denounced in the Knesset for anti-semitism, adding to the accusations of hedonism, nihilism and post-Zionism levelled at him by critics. In 1997 he was attacked for a story, &quot;Rabin is Dead&quot;, in which the title alludes to both the assassinated prime minister and a child&apos;s cat that gets run over. Keret, aged 39, is often hailed as the voice of young Israelis. Yet his is a fragmented generation, and his anti-heroes tend to be racked by self-doubt and suicidal tendencies, in contrast to a self-styled heroic generation that came of age with the state - more Woody Allen than Moshe Dayan. Speaking of an &quot;intrinsic tension between Israeli and Jewish identity&quot;, at London&apos;s Jewish Book Week earlier this month, Keret said the idea was that &quot;in the diaspora, Jews are weak, so we Israelis should be the opposite - which is something I try to fight against&quot;. He co-authored a stage show, The Entebbe Operation: A Musical (1993), which satirised notions of heroism, while in his story &quot;The Son of the Head of the Mossad&quot;, the unlikely scion is a skinny kid who proves a disappointment to his overbearing father. That story appeared in Gaza Blues (David Paul, 2004), co-authored with the Palestinian writer Samir El-Youssef at the height of the al-Aqsa intifada in 2000. The idea behind the story collection, Keret says, was that &quot;if people are saying we can&apos;t coexist in real life, let&apos;s coexist in book form, and show we have something in common&quot;. According to one of his admirers, Sayed Kashua, a Palestinian Israeli writer whose novel Let It Be Morning was recently published in Britain, &quot;in Israel, there&apos;s no place for individualism. It has to be obvious to which party or camp you belong. Etgar is not obvious - he&apos;s confusing.&quot; Keret&apos;s refusal to wear party allegiances on his lapel has irritated some readers. Writing for newspapers in Israel and abroad, whether exposing IDF conduct at army checkpoints or commenting on disengagement, he finds subtleties are lost. &quot;I said I wanted the settlements wiped off the face of the earth, but not the settlers. This is seen as confused in leftwing discourse: I should say I hate the settlers. But we have a common responsibility in Israel for the situation that&apos;s been created. People don&apos;t understand. They say: &apos;Are you for us or against us?&apos;&quot; Keret is genially expansive for one known for lapidary fiction (&quot;all my family talk a lot&quot;). He lives in Tel Aviv with his wife, Shira Geffen, an actor and theatre director, and their 14-month-old son Lev, and lectures in film at Tel Aviv university. His brother, Nimrod, is a peace activist who founded the legalise marijuana movement in Israel, but has lived for the past two years &quot;in a treehouse in Thailand&quot;. His sister Dana became ultra-Orthodox and has 11 children - who are forbidden on religious grounds to read Keret&apos;s comic books. Yet Keret sees the siblings as working for shared values, &quot;me through art, my sister through belief, and my brother through social activism. None of us is a rich doctor.&quot; He was born in Tel Aviv in 1967, the youngest of the three. His parents were Holocaust survivors, his mother from Poland and his father from a Yiddish-speaking village on the Polish-Russian border, who &quot;spent two years in a hole&quot; hiding from the Nazis. They spoke little of their own past, but &quot;one would tell a story about the other&quot;. Writing became &quot;a place I could be myself&quot;. Keret&apos;s treatment of the Holocaust in some stories has drawn charges of irreverence, but he contrasts the &quot;rigid and petrifying&quot; national memory with the living memories his parents passed on. &quot;You&apos;re always told, if you weren&apos;t there, you can&apos;t understand. My father rebelled against that, saying we knew all the emotions he felt.&quot; To critics, he says: &quot;It&apos;s not your memory; it doesn&apos;t belong to the nation. It belongs to me.&quot; Nor did his parents see themselves as victims. &quot;It&apos;s dehumanising; to protect your victimhood you have to ignore others&apos; pain.&quot; His childhood perception, as someone born in the year of the six day war, was of an Israel &quot;admired for its courage in fighting a stronger enemy&quot;. With Israel&apos;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and the Sabra-Chatila refugee camp massacres, &quot;the image of us only reacting to aggression was broken. The first Lebanon war was Israel&apos;s Vietnam. We started to become reflexive; you see that the narrative you live is not the only narrative - others are telling another story. I realised we&apos;re making choices. You assume more responsibility.&quot; During military service, he was a &quot;very bad soldier&quot;, he says. &quot;Our upbringing was always to ask questions and offer alternatives. They kicked me out of a lot of units.&quot; Guarding computers in an underground bunker, he began to write. &quot;In the army you feel violated - there&apos;s no private space,&quot; he says. &quot;Writing was a life-saver, a way of recovering private territory.&quot; The spur was the suicide of his best friend when Keret was 19. &quot;I was the one who found him. Two weeks later, I wrote my first story.&quot; Keret relishes Hebrew, a &quot;unique language, kept in the deep freeze for 2,000 years, then instantly defrosted. It&apos;s got gaps, but you can invent words.&quot; Yet he feels closer to a Jewish diasporic tradition of Kafka, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Shalom Aleichem and Yiddish folktales than to Israeli writers, seeing his vignettes as a digression from a dominant tradition of nation-building epics. He also lays claim to a form of humour &quot;we&apos;ve lost along the way&quot;, one &quot;not used to put others down, but as a tool for criticising yourself and showing love to those close to you&quot;. &quot;Not a nationalist by nature&quot;, Keret takes issue with Yehoshua&apos;s &quot;idea of the Israeli as an \u00fcber Jew, an improved, upgraded Jew&quot;. Israelis, in Keret&apos;s view, &quot;have a lot to learn from diaspora Jews about values that have vanished from Israeli society. Jewish identity is all about doubting and questioning from a deep moral place.The heroes of the Bible - Jonah, Job - had no problem arguing with God. I&apos;d like to see more of that questioning in Israeli society.&quot; The ambiguity of Keret&apos;s stories can infuriate some readers. For &quot;Cocked and Locked&quot;, about a violent confrontation between a Palestinian fighter and a young Israeli soldier, he says &quot;I got attacked for being a leftwing liberal and an Arab-hating fascist, because I don&apos;t write in the political tradition of saying who&apos;s the good guy and who&apos;s the bad guy. They were looking for a code.&quot; He sees the story as being about the corrupting nature and hypocrisy of military occupation. &quot;When you occupy others and live in an atmosphere of fear where people hate you, you can&apos;t keep your morality,&quot; he says. &quot;But people can be two-faced. In Israel we say, &apos;shooting and crying&apos;, which means we hate being in this situation, and that we&apos;re really good. Or &apos;purity of the weapon&apos;. But how can a weapon be pure?&quot; He had friends serving in the army during the first intifada of 1987-93. &quot;There&apos;s something inhuman about the climate, where everybody wants you out, or dead. Saying we&apos;re there but we don&apos;t have anything against civilians, as though we&apos;re androids, doesn&apos;t work. People don&apos;t work like that - especially 18-year-old kids. &quot;What you experience in the army, aged 18 to 21, is what you take through all your life. You cross invisible lines: you shoot someone, get shot, break into people&apos;s houses.

Recalling the film shoot for Total Love in Goa, he likens the tone of some Israeli tourists to Indians to &quot;an Israeli soldier speaking to a Palestinian at a checkpoint - the arrogance and aggression&quot;. He co-wrote the film - about &quot;Israel&apos;s drug and travelling culture&quot; - and has co-directed Jellyfish with his wife, based on her own screenplay.

The sky over Gaza was a broad wash of purple blue, and along the seafront the surf was breaking into small whitecaps. Ali Ghalia was on a day off from his work as a farmer and decided to take his family for lunch on the beach at Beit Lahiya, a few minutes&apos; drive from their home. The beach on the Mediterranean, with its rolling dunes and dry grasses, is a rare delight in a stretch of land ground down by poverty, overcrowding, militancy and decades of military occupation. It is free to the public and barely touched by development - just a few half-built hotels are dotted along the 25-mile coastline, the shadow of a tourist industry that never was. Ghalia had two wives, as is still sometimes the custom in the Palestinian territories, and both were with him on the beach that day, along with their dozen children and their beach kit: several plastic armchairs, plates of food and cooking pots, flasks of tea, plastic toys, blankets to sit on and a small cot for the baby. They ate lunch and lazed in the sunshine, and were still on the beach shortly after 4.30pm. Although it was a Friday afternoon, others in Gaza were still at work, among them Zakariah Abu Harbeed, 37, a cameraman with Ramattan, the leading Palestinian news agency. He is based at the agency&apos;s 10th-floor offices in Gaza City, ready to report breaking stories. Often in Gaza that means covering the conflict - dozens of times he has filmed the dead and the dying, and he has been shot at and wounded in the process. That Friday, Abu Harbeed had been to Beit Hanoun, a town close to the northern border of the strip, to film the scene of an Israeli attack on a group of suspected militants. On his way back, he ran into another story. The Israeli military had just destroyed a car that they also suspected was carrying militants. He filmed that scene, too, and went to the hospital to get footage of the injured. It was, for him, an ordinary day&apos;s work. It was shortly after 4.30pm. Then he took a call from a contact in the ambulance service: the Israeli military were shelling the beach at Beit Lahiya and there were casualties. He called his driver and they jumped into the car. That afternoon at the beach, Abu Harbeed shot about 10 minutes of film for which he later won two awards. He arrived just in time to record the aftermath of a terrible explosion that had killed most of the Ghalia family. Seven were dead: Ali Ghalia, 49, and one of his wives, Ra&apos;eesa, 35, together with five children: Haitham, five months old; Hanadi, 18 months; Sabreen, four; Ilham, 15; and Aliya, 17. Several others were injured, some severely, including more children from the family. Much of the film Abu Harbeed made that day is so graphic it would never be broadcast on television in the west. One clip, however, was broadcast repeatedly that day and in the days that followed. It showed Huda Ghalia, aged 12, distraught and sobbing by the body of her dead father. It was an image distilling Palestinian despair, one that recalled the film of Mohammad al-Dura, the 12-year-old boy who died in his father&apos;s arms in Gaza in a hail of gunfire six years ago, at the start of the intifada. Abu Harbeed talked me through the footage in a cramped video editing suite at the Ramattan offices. It begins as they drive up to the beach, the film shot from the passenger seat through a cracked windscreen with the blare of a siren in the background. There is one ambulance, its back door open, and half a dozen men shouting and panicked. Between them they uncover one limp body after another, dragging them out quickly and either placing them on a stretcher or running with them to the ambulance. They don&apos;t have time to notice that several of the bodies they are carrying are dead, the wounds horrific, impossible to survive. One of the men reaches for a girl, grabs her black clothes at the shoulder and places her on a green canvas stretcher. Her left arm has been blown off just above the elbow. She is pale, unconscious and looks dead, but in fact she survives. I learned later that her name is Amani. Somewhere among the bodies is her sister, Ayhaam. She, too, is badly injured but survives. As this was going on, Abu Harbeed just stood still and filmed. He is a professional just doing his job, and methodical. &quot;You can see I&apos;m not getting close to the bodies,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s too much for the audience. I&apos;m getting the wide picture. But then I felt there was someone alive nearby, as if there was some life coming out of this death. Suddenly Huda imposed herself on this massacre.&quot; Huda is at the corner of the screen, watching the men remove the bodies. She stands still, her arms by her side. She is in a blue T-shirt, her black hair curled down to her shoulders. As the last body is removed, Huda turns around and starts to run, her hands reach forward, the fingers splayed. Abu Harbeed follows her with his camera. &quot;I couldn&apos;t tell where she was going. I just followed her.&quot; Huda reaches a dune, stops running and clasps her arms across her chest. She begins to scream: &quot;Oh father, oh father&quot;, and the screaming continues even as she throws herself into the sand. The camera pans back to show her lying next to the body of her father, Ali Ghalia, broad-shouldered with a grey moustache and lying on his back. His mouth and eyes are open, but he is dead, his pupils rolled up under his eyelids. Huda is still screaming. By now Abu Harbeed was quietly crying in the editing suite. After a minute he looked up. &quot;I don&apos;t like to see these pictures. They make me suffer,&quot; he said simply. &quot;I wanted people to see that this is a family that did nothing to anyone. There are no weapons, no military uniforms, just a picnic.&quot; Beit Lahiya is a poor neighbourhood in the far north of the Gaza Strip. Many of the householders used to work as labourers in Israel, but since a clampdown on permits for work that income has dried up. Most now make a living farming the fields that lie just to the north, between the town and the concrete wall and steel fence that marks the border with Israel. But Gaza&apos;s farming industry is also struggling, thanks to Israel&apos;s repeated closure of the major crossing points out of the strip. Those closures have so damaged farm exports that many no longer bother investing in the seeds to plant cash crops such as strawberries and cherry tomatoes in the first place. Israel says the closures are justified on grounds of security. In effect it means that poverty levels have risen (unemployment in Gaza is running at 40%, according to the UN) and many families, like the Ghalias, have run up credit at local grocery stores which they hope to pay off in the future. The Ghalia family house is unexceptional: a two-storey breeze block structure that looks at least partly homemade. It has a red-tin door, and next to it a spindly cactus that rises up to the height of the first floor and bows under the weight of the family washing line. Outside, there is a constant noise of children playing and the occasional donkey-drawn cart that passes by: the first has a boy with a loud-hailer advertising his tray of freshly caught fish; a few minutes later another cart goes by with baskets of live chickens. The family live on the ground floor, in a couple of empty rooms furnished only with mattresses and blankets that are rolled up and stacked against the wall each morning. Huda shares a bare bedroom with her two younger sisters, Hadeel, eight, and Latifa, seven. In the months after the explosion on the beach, I went to visit Huda and her family many times, to listen to the story of a household struck by a tragedy, a family that captured the headlines and then dropped from sight. I ate with them, went to school with them, drove with them to see relatives and visited their injured in hospital. The first time I met the Ghalias, they were sitting on plastic chairs in the sunshine outside the front door of the house. Ayham, 20, the oldest son, receives visitors. He is quiet and surly, and like most of the men in the family he smokes, though not in front of his mother or uncles. Since his father&apos;s death, he has become responsible for taking a lead in family decisions. He also works as a part-time guard at a local UN office and has begun a two-year secretarial diploma at the Islamic University in Gaza City. The university is affiliated to Hamas, the Islamic militant movement elected into power a year ago, and the course is to be paid for by Hamas: one of a small number of official contributions made to the family since what they call simply &quot;the incident&quot;. After a while, Huda appeared. She was barefoot and dressed in a black cloak with a white veil on her head. A gold bracelet hung from her wrist. She was quiet and monosyllabic: still visibly affected by what had happened. Huda and her two younger sisters have started at a new school, a Hamas-run girls&apos; school in Gaza City, their tuition another gift from Hamas. She said she preferred the new school. &quot;I have new friends now,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t see the old friends any more.&quot; She had just returned from a visit that she, her two sisters, her mother and her aunt made to the United Arab Emirates. &quot;It was fine,&quot; she said. It was her first time out of Gaza. Some weeks later, Huda produced a photo album of that trip. The visit the family described to me was part political and part medical. Huda&apos;s mother, Hamdiya, 41, who had been badly injured in the right hand, was treated in hospital, as were Latifa and Hadeel. The film of Huda on the beach turned her into such a symbolic figure that many Arab officials queued up to see her. One photograph shows Huda standing with her fingers in a V for victory salute, in front of a poster of Abbas and the late Yasser Arafat. Another shows her sitting on a sofa in a pink dress and wide-brimmed hat, talking to the deputy prime minister of the Emirates. But the pictures the children most enjoy show them incongruously dressed in red ski outfits and helmets, holding plastic sleds at a vast indoor ski centre in Dubai. In Gaza, Huda had already met Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Both spoke of adopting her, as did other dignitaries she met. They meant that loosely - not taking her into their families to bring up as their own, but offering her moral and financial support. They were public gestures, singling out a girl suffering a private grief. On their return from the Emirates, Huda crossed back into Gaza through Israel with a special VIP pass. Her mother and the rest of the family had to cross from Egypt, through the Rafah crossing, which is frequently closed and always overcrowded. They had no special passes. With so much attention paid to the young girl, it is perhaps not surprising that the family began to feel a degree of frustration. For one thing, their neighbours presumed that this political attention, international travel and talk of adoption would translate into great financial wealth for the Ghalias. Hamas stepped forward to pay for the children&apos;s education, and a Qatari charity paid for the rebuilding of a house for Amani, the eldest daughter, married with two children, who lost most of her left arm in the incident. President Abbas provided around \u00a31,000 and there appears to be the promise of money from the Emirates to pay to rebuild the family house - although eight months on from the incident, no work has begun. But there has been no more than that. Only after some time did it become clear to the neighbourhood that the Ghalias were still living as precariously as everyone around them. Secondly, there was the extraordinary attention Huda received. Although she featured prominently in the footage shot on the beach, she was only lightly injured. The family was upset by the iconic status she had been given and angry that the others, who suffered much more serious physical wounds, had been overlooked. Huda&apos;s younger brother, Adham, 10, suffered serious shrapnel wounds to his stomach and mouth, and was eventually transferred to the US for treatment. He is still living there, looked after by a series of expatriate Palestinian families who ensure he receives the medical care he needs and that he is attending school. He calls home several times a week. Huda&apos;s two elder sisters, Amani and Ayhaam, who were the most seriously injured, have been in and out of hospital, and still have months of serious operations ahead of them. &quot;Huda was seen on television, that&apos;s all,&quot; said Hassan Ghalia. &quot;But it is not only Huda, believe me. She is the one who saw everything and was seen by the world, but other people lost so much and nobody saw them.&quot; Hassan, 33, is one of Huda&apos;s uncles, the thinner and younger brother of her dead father, Ali. Of the several uncles who live nearby and take care of the family, Hassan is perhaps the most mature. He, too, is a farmer, but can&apos;t afford to plant this year and has no other work. He is carefully spoken and always points out that though he blames the Israeli military for the explosion, he does not blame the Israeli people, with whom he hopes the Palestinians will one day find peace. He told me, &quot;The Palestinians firing rockets at Israel are doing it out of ideology. The Israeli military who fire at us are doing it out of ideology. And we are just crushed in the middle.&quot; In the months ahead, it was Hassan who volunteered to look after his niece, Ayhaam, accompanying her on the trips to hospital in Israel and taking care of her physiotherapy on her return. And after all, he said, this was not the first crisis to hit the family. A year and a half earlier, in January 2005, several of his nephews were involved in another, equally traumatic incident: seven children, all under the age of 18, were killed, and seven other people, including five more children, were severely injured when they were hit by Israeli tank shells. The children, most from the Ghaben family, were in farmland just north of Beit Lahiya, picking strawberries. Witnesses said militants had been firing mortars from the fields over the border into Israel that morning, but disappeared as the Israeli shelling began. The Israeli military said it targeted a group of masked men preparing to fire more mortars. Three of the children lost both their legs - including Issa Ghalia, now 15, who is a regular visitor to Huda&apos;s family. He was treated in Israel and later in Iran. He was fitted with a pair of prosthetic legs, but prefers not to use them and instead would swing through the gate, up the steps and on to a chair using his arms alone. &quot;The legs are good, but sometimes I just get tired of them,&quot; he said one day as he sat listening to the family&apos;s news. It is attacks such as these that have discouraged farmers in northern Gaza from going anywhere near their fields by the border. On a Saturday morning I went to Huda&apos;s new school, the Dar al-Arqam, which is large, clean and imposing. Three newly-painted buildings stand on three sides of a large concrete playground. It has been open since August 2003 and around 1,500 children, aged between five and 15, study here. Nearly all are girls, although there are temporarily a small number of boys, too, because their school was damaged in recent fighting. All the teachers are women. &quot;It is our kingdom,&quot; the deputy head, Eman Nassar, 34, told me. She took a degree in biochemistry at an Egyptian university and spent six years as a kindergarten teacher in Gaza before coming to the school. Around a third of the children are loosely termed &quot;orphans&quot;, meaning one or both of their parents have either died during the conflict or are among the 10,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Like Huda and her sisters, they do not pay school fees. In addition, any child in the fourth grade or above who scores more than 95% in their end of year exams is exempt from school fees, which range up to 320 Jordanian dinars (\u00a3240) a year. The school is openly affiliated to Hamas - although the teachers are at pains to insist that does not make them signed-up members of the movement - and there is a strong religious element to the teaching. Qur&apos;anic learning is a key part of the children&apos;s curriculum, as are Arabic, English, science, maths, geography and history, all taught from government textbooks. Almost all the girls wear a uniform of a black cloak and a white veil over their hair. At home I noticed Huda now almost always veiled her hair, though her hair was not veiled that day at the beach. &quot;We work for God, not for Hamas or Islamic Jihad or anyone else,&quot; said Nassar. &quot;We work for God and we want our children to be the best.&quot; The children themselves are not all from Hamas-supporting families - the Ghalias, for example, are almost wholly divorced from politics and show no particular loyalty to any of Gaza&apos;s political factions. Nassar said the goal of the school is to teach the children to think, not to prepare them for any set role as women or in politics. &quot;Everyone has to learn. But how you use that knowledge, that&apos;s what&apos;s important,&quot; she said. The teachers are all well-educated and the school is in far better condition than government schools in the area. The school day is longer, and the class sizes smaller. Huda, with her government school background, found herself well behind other girls of her age. Her English was particularly poor and she was extremely reluctant to speak up in class. It didn&apos;t help that she was teased a lot by the other children, and even now in between classes she plays with her sisters more than her classmates. &quot;The other children would run after her saying, &apos;Huda Ghalia, Huda Ghalia&apos;, and, &apos;Oh father, oh father&apos;, just like they&apos;d seen on television,&quot; said her teacher, Nadia Shurafa, 25. &quot;Her response was to be shy and not talk to anyone. She tried to forget about what happened, but no one lets her forget. She just wants to be normal.&quot; The conflict in Gaza has such a huge impact on all the children&apos;s lives that the school does its own psychological work. There are several others like Huda who have seen members of their families killed in front of them. Sometimes it is a matter of stepping in to prevent fighting in the playground. &quot;They fight very easily,&quot; said Nassar. &quot;They form themselves into different militia groups and act out what they&apos;ve seen. Or they play &apos;I&apos;m a Jew, you&apos;re a Palestinian&apos;. You have to keep your eyes on them and try to get them to talk about what they feel. And sometimes you just have to accept what they do.&quot; One teacher, Asma&apos;a Obaid, 24, runs one-on-one sessions for the most traumatised children, including Huda. She encourages them to talk through their experiences and to draw scenes from the incidents they have been through. Obaid flicked through some of the most recent paintings on her desk. They show pictures of dead children, helicopters firing missiles into buildings and key events in recent Gazan history, including the killing of the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. &quot;Sometimes the children say they want to kill the person who killed their father, or brother, or whoever it was,&quot; Obaid said. &quot;We tell them it&apos;s better to educate themselves.&quot; She often asks the children to draw a happier picture than the violence all around them ,and she produced one painting drawn by Huda that showed a large, multicoloured house next to a row of trees, with flowers and seven people in the garden and a smiling sun in the sky. &quot;A specialist psychologist visited the school and saw this and said this represents where Huda wants to be, this place of stability and sunshine,&quot; Obaid said. Huda&apos;s days are spent at school, or playing with brothers, sisters and cousins at home or the house of one of two uncles, Hassan and Yahya, who both live across the street. Every few weeks she is driven down to the south, to a house in the sand dunes near Khan Yunis, to see the woman she knows as her grandmother, who for 20 years has acted as a spiritual healer. I went with her once and watched as the old woman talked to Huda, reading to her from the Qur&apos;an and feeding her a sweet-smelling juice made of amber and musk, a potion rumoured to have special remedial properties. &quot;This helps to push out the fear,&quot; said the 70-year-old woman, Um Khalid, the mother of Ali Ghalia&apos;s second wife, Ra&apos;eesa, who was Huda&apos;s stepmother and who was also killed in the beach explosion. &quot;Thanks to God and this liquid, everyone gets better. I have a connection with God, you see. I just make the treatment and it all comes out of her. She calms down and she has really improved over time. They will forget eventually.&quot; One afternoon, Huda was standing on the roof terrace of her family house in Beit Lahiya, picking passion fruit off a vine with her mother and younger sisters. The terrace looks over the back garden, which is small but full of trees: figs, oranges, lemon, a date palm and a banana tree that needs cutting back. It was several months after the incident on the beach and Huda was slowly beginning to open up. She was still shy, but less withdrawn than when I first met her. We talked about the new school, which she seemed to prefer. She talked about perhaps being a lawyer in future - this is what Sheikh Hamdan, the deputy prime minister in the Emirates, had suggested: &quot;Become a lawyer, defend your rights.&quot; She talked about the television - the footage of her still reappears occasionally on the Arabic news channels. &quot;We don&apos;t have a television and I won&apos;t go to any house that does have a television,&quot; she said. Her teachers say she is too frightened to look at any photographs of herself. &quot;I remember that day and what happened,&quot; Huda said. &quot;I can&apos;t forget it and sometimes I dream of it. I am trying to forget, but I can&apos;t.&quot; As is often the case in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the cause of the explosion that afternoon on the beach is much disputed. The Ghalia family and others hold the Israeli military responsible for the blast, saying an artillery shell hit the family. The Israeli military had fired thousands of shells into Gaza in the preceding weeks, aimed at preventing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli towns, and admitted firing a number of shells from the sea and the land on that Friday. But the Israel Defence Force denied responsibility at the time and, in a written response for this article, said the explosion that killed the Ghalias was &quot;without a doubt, not caused by the IDF&quot;. This conclusion was based on &quot;intelligence analysis, Palestinian claims, media coverage of the incident and IDF filmed footage that documented all IDF activity during that day&quot;. It admitted the Israeli military had fired six artillery shells: the IDF could account for where five of those shells landed, but not the first shell, which it said was fired at 4.30pm. &quot;The possibility that this shell landed in the area of the incident is close to zero,&quot; it said. The IDF concluded, based on clips of video footage, that the blast happened some minutes later and not before 4.57pm. The IDF also said that two pieces of shrapnel taken from two of the people injured at the scene did not come from 155mm IDF artillery shells. In its written response, the IDF offered no other possible cause for the blast, though in the days after the incident it suggested there had been a coincidental separate explosion on the beach at that time in the afternoon, caused either by a buried old shell or a mine planted by Hamas. Several human rights groups and press reports at the time raised points of difference with the IDF account. In particular, a detailed article by the Guardian&apos;s Chris McGreal on June 17 showed that the timings noted in hospital records, and by a doctor and an ambulance driver, indicated that the blast happened some minutes earlier than the IDF maintains - so challenging the IDF&apos;s central claim that its shelling had stopped by the time the Ghalias were killed. The article also cited a former Pentagon battlefield analyst working for Human Rights Watch who believed that the crater size, shrapnel, types of injuries and their location on the victims&apos; bodies (particularly to the head and torso) pointed to a shell dropping from the sky, not explosives under the sand. Witnesses spoke of hearing other blasts at the time, consistent with a pattern of shells falling at the beach. It happens quite frequently that severely ill or injured patients in Gaza who cannot get adequate treatment in the strip&apos;s hospitals are allowed to cross into Israel. And so it was with Huda&apos;s two elder sisters, Amani and Ayhaam: shortly after the incident, both were taken to hospitals in Israel. Amani, 23, whose left arm had to be amputated above the elbow, was taken to hospital in Be&apos;er Sheva and travels back and forth from Gaza on a regular basis. Ayhaam, 17, suffered severe injuries to her shoulders, chest, throat and legs, and for many months was confined to a wheelchair. Of all those on the beach that day, she was perhaps the worst injured. Six months after the incident, Ayhaam was back in hospital in Israel, sitting on a metal-framed chair in a third-floor room at the Assaf Harofeh Medical Centre, near Ramla. With her was her uncle Hassan, who spent every day and every night in the ward at his niece&apos;s bedside. It was his first time in Israel since 1993. He spoke little Hebrew, the doctors spoke little Arabic, but he could talk to the cleaners, most of whom were Arab Israelis. He found many of the Jewish families in the hospital welcoming. &quot;It&apos;s more human than political,&quot; he said as we sat together in the ward. &quot;Most people we&apos;ve met are compassionate. Their reaction is: &apos;We suffer in the same way you suffer.&apos;&quot; It was Ayhaam&apos;s third time at this hospital, and when she had arrived about two weeks earlier, the doctors had been deeply concerned and advised an urgent operation. The problem was with her windpipe, which had narrowed so much that she was having difficulty breathing. It wasn&apos;t clear to the doctors whether the narrowing was caused by a shrapnel injury, or was the result of a long intubation in another hospital, or whether a small opening in the windpipe had become infected. Whichever, Dr Ilan Bar, one of Israel&apos;s leading cardio-thoracic surgeons, concluded that he needed to cut away the narrowed section of the trachea and then reconnect the remaining ends. In a small office off the wards, Bar opened his textbook to show me the procedure. &quot;You pray to God that it doesn&apos;t disrupt,&quot; he said. &quot;It is very rare and very risky.&quot; For the first few hours after the operation, it appeared to have been successful. Then, when Bar was out at a Saturday night football match at his Tel Aviv local club, he was called back to the hospital: Ayhaam&apos;s condition had seriously deteriorated. &quot;That Saturday night the doctor told me there wasn&apos;t anything more they could do,&quot; Hassan said. &quot;We were just waiting for her to die.&quot; But by the Sunday morning Ayhaam had recovered. &quot;For now I can say the procedural technique was successful,&quot; said Bar. &quot;Now I want to take care of all the other problems she has, like walking and movement, clearing her lungs, healing her bladder. Our procedure was life-saving; now let&apos;s deal with the other problems that can make her life whole.&quot; On the Tuesday after her operation, Ayhaam was sitting up, alert, in her room. Her feet, sunk in a pair of pink slippers, had been gently taped to a simple pedal machine to begin the first stages of physiotherapy. Bar, on his morning rounds, seemed pleased with her condition. &quot;Today for the first time I saw her smiling,&quot; he said. &quot;Before, she used to just lie on the bed like a sack of potatoes.&quot; I asked him about the politics of the case, but he was dismissive. It was not the first time he has treated Palestinian patients: seriously injured children are quite often sent to his hospital and he has once visited Gaza to meet doctors there. Two weeks later, Hassan and Ayhaam travelled back to Gaza by ambulance. The driver stopped at a hospital in Be&apos;er Sheva to pick up another Palestinian patient, an elderly women in the final stages of cancer who was heading back to Gaza to die at her family&apos;s side. But the woman was sicker than the doctors had thought and she died in the ambulance. The driver had no choice but to carry on his journey. They passed quickly through the Erez crossing into northern Gaza. At that point, Hassan noticed, the driver suddenly speeded up and took a corner too quickly. The ambulance lurched over and toppled on to its side, throwing Hassan, Ayhaam and the dead woman on top of each other across the vehicle. The pair were bruised but not badly hurt, and as he told the story later, Hassan shrugged as if this sort of bad fortune was something they had come to expect. The last time I saw them, Ayhaam was sitting on the porch of Hassan&apos;s house, warming herself in the afternoon sun. Most of the rest of the family were around her, apart from Adham, who was still in the US. Huda, who had just finished her end-of-term exams, was there, along with her younger sisters and her mother, as well as Amani, back briefly from hospital in Israel and soon to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. Her husband and their two children were with her. The family were laughing among themselves, and it was the first time I had seen them like this. They were happy to have the two elder girls home, and celebrating the news that another of Huda&apos;s uncles, Yahya, 38, had finally got himself a job working as a gardener for the municipal authority. It was to pay him just 1,000 shekels a month, but this was the first time he&apos;d had work for many months. Yahya, who is always quick to make light of their lives, joked that he was so important at work, he&apos;d soon be able to supply bags of flour and food for the family. &quot;Ask God not to fire him,&quot; said Hassan, feigning a look of despair. He talked about Ayhaam and her slow recovery, and finding suitable medical care for her in Gaza, which has now become his main responsibility. As the family chatted, there was no mention of the day on the beach last summer.

Joey Barton is among those excluded while Gareth Barry&apos;s return to the international fold seems to have lasted no longer than a second-half outing against Spain. Shaun Wright-Phillips is another conspicuous by his absence, having paid the price for a careless performance in the Spaniards&apos; 1-0 victory at Old Trafford. The Chelsea winger can hardly have any grievances but Barton and Barry are both entitled to feel slightly hard done by, particularly the Aston Villa player at a time when McClaren is without his regular left-back, Ashley Cole, and the usual back-up, Wayne Bridge. Martin O&apos;Neill, the Villa manager, is not a man to criticise an international manager without believing there is good cause, yet he felt sufficiently aggrieved to call McClaren&apos;s decision-making into question. &quot;In a time when he [Barry] has played a significant number of games at left-back for us, and played very well indeed, and considering that Bridge is injured and Cole is suspended, I&apos;d be really disappointed to think Gareth wasn&apos;t cap-able of playing left-back in that side,&quot; said O&apos;Neill. &quot;Gareth&apos;s had a fantastic season and it&apos;s frustrating.

But Steve McClaren will have to do without first-choice right-back Gary Neville, who injured ankle ligaments against Bolton and his understudy, Micah Richards, who suffered a similar injury in Manchester City&apos;s win at Middlesbrough. Johnson, like Aaron Lennon, is a pacy player who excites McClaren but has had frustratingly little opportunity to show what he can do. He was not taken to the World Cup, was asked to play on the right in a front three in Amsterdam before Christmas, and missed the last friendly through injury. Now he and Lennon are available at the right time, games today and tomorrow permitting, and have been selected in the roles they presently perform for their clubs. McClaren was able to announce quite proudly that only one player will be out of position, though capable as Jamie Carragher might be as an emergency left back the absence of the suspended Ashley Cole, the injured Wayne Bridge and the unfancied Gareth Barry leaves the team once again without a natural left-sided player to go along with the problems at right-back. In those circumstances, and with tomorrow evening&apos;s FA Cup replays a further complication England do not need, McClaren is surely right to revert to the tried and usually trusted 4-4-2. There is a time for trying new formations and asking players to do slightly different things, and this is clearly not it. Not so soon after the experiment with three at the back in Croatia cost England three points and put McClaren&apos;s neck on the line in Israel, though naturally the coach denies this could be his defining moment. &apos;It&apos;s a big game, but we are not going to qualify or get knocked out in Israel,&apos; he said. &apos;No one qualifies in March, there are eight games left and four of our last five are at Wembley. Teams will take points off each other in this group, I&apos;m sure about that, in fact they have already started. We dropped two by drawing at home against Macedonia.&apos; When it was put to McClaren that a draw might not be a bad result in Israel he said he did not even want to think about it. &apos;We are going to win this game,&apos; he said. &apos;We have the experience, the talent and the capability to get the job done. I trust these players, whatever happens in the replays we will join up on Tuesday and get on with it. We need to put up a performance of true English character, backs to the wall if you like, and I think we can. People might say 4-4-2 is rigid and limited, but if we have Aaron on the left and Steven Gerrard on the right I don&apos;t think anyone could accuse us of playing in straight lines. This is a time to be pragmatic. We&apos;ve tried other things, but this is what we know best.&apos; So, a good result in Tel Aviv and people will be asking what is the point of Terry Venables. A bad one, and McClaren will have nowhere left to turn. . The time has come, in other words, for McClaren&apos;s England to stand up and be counted. For the players to show that their coach knows what he is talking about, and is not merely a propagandist for the Premiership&apos;s big names. If England don&apos;t walk the walk this time, McClaren will end up talking the talk to himself. Which will be a pity, because he does it so well. When, for example, did we ever hear Sven-Goran Eriksson wax as lyrical as McClaren when doting on Lennon? &apos;We haven&apos;t had that type of player for a while, someone who can take the ball right down the length of the field and change things in an instant,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;We all know about Aaron&apos;s pace, but he&apos;s mentally strong too. He&apos;s at home with England, relaxed about it. You can always tell by the way players react when they join their first squad. I had a little look at Aaron in his first training session, and he was enjoying himself. It was as if he&apos;d been there all the time. That&apos;s a great sign. Wayne Rooney was just the same, and so was Micah Richards. I think Aaron has the temperament and the talent to be a very good England player.&apos; Love poem, prayer, or just wishful thinking? Quite possibly all three, but mainly a coded message. What McClaren would really like to say Lennon boils down to just four heartfelt words.

Here are three good reasons why the Football League&apos;s half-baked suggestion that every draw should produce a penalty shoot-out and an extra point for the winner should be booted into the long grass with Sepp Blatter&apos;s other cunning stunts, such as making goals bigger or women&apos;s shorts smaller. 1) The ratio of three points for a win and one for a draw is the best football has yet come up with and has already produced a dramatic increase in positive, attacking play. When Manchester United won the first Premiership title they did so with a total of 84 points from a possible 126. The Premier League subsequently lost two teams and the maximum points available dropped to 114, yet when United won the title in 2000 they gathered 91 points, and when Chelsea won it in Jose Mourinho&apos;s first season they posted a new record of 95. With eight league games still to play United&apos;s present points total is in the mid-seventies, which is all champions used to finish up with 10 years ago. The same trend is detectable in the Championship, where Reading were promoted with a record 106 points last season. Points totals in each division are rising, not falling, suggesting the most successful teams have worked out that playing for a draw is not the best policy and that titles are won by teams prepared to go for maximum points at home and away. Change that dynamic to the one Lord Mawhinney&apos;s working party is considering, however, and football could swiftly return to the conservative days of shutting up shop away from home. Arsenal have already spent much of the season moaning about teams whose first priority is not to concede a goal and whose only ambition is to leave the Emirates with a point. How much worse would that situation become if what was on offer was a possible two points from winning a penalty shoot-out? 2) Teams from lower down the table are perfectly entitled to play defensively away from home against bigger, more powerful opponents. Defending is part of the game and there is absolutely nothing in the laws that says smaller clubs should make life easy for their opponents by allowing them to play to their strengths. If solid, organised defending has kept a talented attacking side at bay for 90 minutes, why insult that achievement with the lottery of a shoot-out? Most grown-ups can accept, even admire, the concept of a tie, a shared result with honours even. Just because the Americans can&apos;t get their heads round a non-result doesn&apos;t mean the rest of the world should fall in line. We should be proud of our superior tradition, just as we in Europe are proud of our wine, our cheese and our beer. Ever tasted any American cheese? In the Premiership at least, small teams playing defensively away to big teams is more a reflection of the gulf in resources between top and bottom than a lack of adventure. When teams lower down the table play each other, an away win is still well worth aiming for. Look how bucked Wigan were when they picked up three points at Manchester City a fortnight ago and how beleaguered Stuart Pearce has appeared ever since. 3) Mawhinney is quite wrong when he claims fans love penalty shoot-outs. How could he possibly know, for a start? The only ones we are familiar with come in tournaments, when they are undeniably freighted with drama on account of having a World Cup or a possible FA Cup win resting on their outcomes. It does not take a genius to work out that if they started happening every Saturday, just to decide whether Bristol Rovers or Brentford go home with an extra point, their fascination would soon pall. Because without the drama, the watching millions and the weird sense that the clocks have stopped that you get with the biggest shoot-outs, there is nothing particularly entertaining in watching 10 blokes take penalties. Mawhinney&apos;s claim that it would &apos;refresh the product&apos; possibly gives away how little he understands of what watching football is all about. If one team needed an extra point to win a title or avoid relegation then fair enough, you have a dramatic situation. But if all the drawn games in October are going to go to shoot-outs then you have a whole series of undramatic situations and many supporters might choose to seek their refreshment in the pub instead. Penalty shoot-outs are only a means of arriving at a result and you can find out the result on Ceefax. So send this one back to the ideas factory stamped &apos;reject, please&apos;. Unless the Football League wants to become famous for shoot-outs that nobody sticks around to watch. When a lousy idea is risky business Playing FA Cup quarter-final replays on the Monday night of an international week is clearly a lousy idea, particularly when England have contrived to make Saturday&apos;s qualifier in Tel Aviv a make-or-break occasion for Steve McClaren. But if there really is no free space in the fixture programme, what with the police insisting on a fortnight&apos;s notice and Manchester United raising money for Unicef, surely a Tuesday or a Wednesday night would have made more sense. Obviously that would have involved meeting up later in the week than normal and not doing any meaningful training sessions in the couple of days before the game, but so what? England&apos;s pre-match plans have already been disrupted and how important are these practice days and tactical talks anyway? McClaren is always complaining that even in a good week he never sees enough of the players to achieve anything worthwhile and it is fair to say that at no time this season have England looked like a team bristling with good ideas from the training pitch. The problem with replays on a Monday night is that it involves key players appearing twice in three days, greatly increasing their risk of injury and ruling them out of any serious training - given that England are travelling on Thursday - until the very end of the week. Little would actually have been lost by allowing the four teams involved in replays to recover properly from their weekend games before playing again, unless McClaren and Terry Venables really believe that quality time with the cones and bibs is going to be crucial to success in Israel. At this stage of the season, when tiredness is more of an issue than fitness, McClaren could have afforded to be a little more relaxed and give his players a break at the same time. They are all experienced internationals and this problem is not of their making. Put it this way, McClaren has a ready-made excuse should things go badly on Saturday. One hopes the FA also have one prepared, in the eventuality of anyone pulling out tomorrow night. Crap joke Manchester humour (thanks CL): The government has confirmed that the country&apos;s first supercasino, at the Sportcity site in east Manchester, will specialise in roulette, poker and blackjack. Anyone wanting crap games can still find them next door at the City of Manchester stadium. Liar, liar, pants on fire... But &apos;son of a whore&apos; is nothing to worry about Just because Paul Jewell is a Scouser with plenty to say for himself does not mean he should not be taken seriously, or that in there among the quips and punchlines there can never be a valid point. His suggestion that he might start learning Portuguese to escape FA censure for criticising referees was bang on. How can the FA throw the book at Arsene Wenger for calling a linesman a &apos;liar&apos;, yet simultaneously excuse Jose Mourinho for branding Mike Riley a &apos;son of a whore&apos;? Don&apos;t all write in at once. That was a rhetorical question. Wenger made his comment at a press conference and it duly found its way into the papers, whereas the fact that Riley did not mention anything untoward in his report of the Chelsea-Tottenham game allowed the FA to confirm smugly there was &apos;no issue to pursue&apos;. Where is the consistency though? The lesson appears to be that there are ways of browbeating officials as long as you are clever enough to exploit them. But what is more clever? Mourinho sounding off in his native tongue or Wenger striving (and narrowly failing) to select the ideal words in his second language? And what of Jewell&apos;s own disrepute charges? Arguably he was under more severe provocation than the other two when Phil Dowd refused a Wigan penalty, failed to let one of his players back on the pitch, and allowed an offside Arsenal equaliser in the space of a couple of minutes. Yet, though Jewell was unwise to suggest the referee might have cost his club \u00a350million, he did not resort to personal insults. Pointing out that the referee got it wrong is not the same as maligning his parentage or questioning his integrity. Perhaps someone should tell the FA that - and not in Portuguese.  paul.wilson@observer.co.uk", "publicationDate": "2007-03-18T23:17:29Z", "title": "Paul Wilson on penalty shootouts", "sentences": ["When a lousy idea is risky business Playing FA Cup quarter-final replays on the Monday night of an international week is clearly a lousy idea, particularly when England have contrived to make Saturday&apos;s qualifier in Tel Aviv a make-or-break occasion for Steve McClaren."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/18/sport.comment"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "David Nugent, the Preston North End striker, was last night placed on standby to join England&apos;s squad for Saturday&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel after Darren Bent was effectively ruled out with a knee injury.

Yet, blinded at the last, it was Arsenal who froze. With victory secured in the dying seconds Everton&apos;s pursuit of qualification for the Uefa Cup has gained renewed momentum. Late success over the Londoners moved the hosts to within a point of fifth-placed Bolton Wanderers, a side stuttering at present, with wild celebrations erupting in the stands and on the touchline at yesterday&apos;s final whistle. It was a fine way to mark the fifth anniversary of David Moyes&apos; arrival at this club. &quot;I don&apos;t think it beat the feeling when we scored our first goal when I came here [against Fulham],&quot; the manager said, &quot;but it came close.&quot; The England coach Steve McClaren, fretting with tonight&apos;s FA Cup replays ahead which could potentially strip him of his resources, must have been just as delighted to acknowledge the game&apos;s decisive moment. Andrew Johnson had been busy enough if starved of clear-cut opportunities, but his bite remained throughout. The striker sprang to flick on Mikel Arteta&apos;s corner a minute into added time then pounced when the ball ricocheted back to him off a combination of Gilberto Silva and Kolo Tour\u00e9 to hammer his 12th goal of the season through the clutter in the six-yard box. All being well, Johnson will start England&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier in Tel Aviv on Saturday and will even be permitted to play in his favoured position, up front. The 26-year-old admitted the prospect leaves him &quot;buzzing&quot;. &quot;He was a real threat all day,&quot; said Moyes, who can bask in the reality that he has succeeded in raising expectations at Goodison Park to the extent that, had his side only drawn here, it would have been considered a wasted opportunity. &quot;Someone just pointed out to me that we&apos;ve taken four points from Liverpool and four from Arsenal this season,&quot; he added. &quot;There are real signs that we are moving forward. It&apos;s going to be tough [to qualify for Europe] with the way that the other sides are playing at the moment, but you hope in the run-in that you win a couple of games people don&apos;t see you winning. Maybe this one was one of those.&quot; Everton&apos;s late reward was merited given that the excellent Lee Carsley and Leon Osman, wriggling between Arsenal markers, had both struck the woodwork. Yet the suspicion remained that the visitors, more leggy than usual, were always there for the taking. The Londoners under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger have regularly come unstuck here before but their season is in danger of petering out into relative mediocrity - they remain comfortable in third, after all, with this a first league defeat of 2007 - given their continued inability to transform pretty approach-play into incisive finishing. They threatened only in patches, a frenzied period just before the interval seeing Julio Baptista, Abou Diaby, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re and Cesc F\u00e1bregas all close to earning them a lead. The Spaniard&apos;s attempt was thwarted by Tim Howard&apos;s legs, and had been prompted by trademark rat-a-tat passes between four visiting players. The move took the breath away, though the sight of Aliadi\u00e8re skying Thomas Rosicky&apos;s pull-back over the bar had the manager grumbling. &quot;It&apos;s very frustrating because you feel the potential is there,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;But this month, mentally, it&apos;s been very hard for us. &quot;We have plenty of goalscorers at the club, though they are not available at the moment, and we&apos;re jaded physically. We lost plenty of opportunities today because our final ball wasn&apos;t good enough and we didn&apos;t create enough, but we&apos;ve lost recently in the last minute against Blackburn Rovers, PSV Eindhoven and now here. That means we miss maturity to deal with that.&quot; That failing is excruciating particularly given Mathieu Flamini&apos;s comments recently that Wenger had apparently informed his team that Manchester United concede too often in the last 20 minutes of games. Another of Arsenal&apos;s options will be denied them from now on in, with Theo Walcott to undergo surgery on a shoulder complaint tomorrow - his first full season at the club is now over. &quot;Until he had his shoulder problem he&apos;d been promising,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;Since then he&apos;s been 50% of the player he was. He played 10 minutes out there and it popped out again, and you can&apos;t play football like that.&quot; Arsenal will need to find a way to adapt their game if an awkward run-in is not to see them surrender third place. For their part, Everton appear to be coping without the injured Tim Cahill, with Carsley anchoring and snarling in midfield to allow Arteta, Manuel Fernandes and Leon Osman to busy themselves around him. &quot;We&apos;ve had to improvise and come up with a new approach,&quot; said Moyes.

There is a drowsy attachment to the idea from the Frenchman himself, who was musing seven years ago that he could fill the post eventually and repeated the reverie at the weekend by murmuring: &quot;In the future, you never know.&quot; The notion has been lingered for so long that it will probably never happen, and maybe it is better that way. Wenger surely suspects that to be the truth. He cannot have forgotten his absolute control of every facet of Arsenal&apos;s football existence, nor would he hesitate to make the comparison with the harum-scarum existence of his counterparts on the international scene. For England fans the notion of Wenger in charge is a way of expressing a longing for beautiful, frictionless football. This is liable to remain a permanent fantasy for them even if it has enough magnetism to pull 5,000 to Tel Aviv for Saturday&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier. The fixation with the national team can never have been so intense as it has been in recent years, just when that devotion is particularly unlikely to be rewarded. With the possible exception of Argentina, who did not get beyond the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup, there are no spellbinding international sides. Many of us were investing in a myth last summer while watching a Brazil line-up with too many veterans and kidding ourselves that something spectacular was imminent. Runner-up France? Not a patch on the thrilling winners of Euro 2000. Victors Italy? Deserving champions, but mainly for that defeat of Germany in Dortmund. England&apos;s own efforts look no better with hindsight, but they were not so far adrift. In fact, disturbing as it is to reflect upon, the team might have been performing much as Sven-Goran Eriksson intended. What if the Swede, having deemed that his midfield was none too good at retaining possession, decided that long balls and set-pieces were the best means of attack? Might he have ruled that it made sense to count on his defence and then hope for the best? A series of supposedly bad days did, after all, get England to within a shoot-out of the semi-finals. It is grim to contemplate the possibility that the World Cup was mostly unfolding according to an Eriksson plan, but perhaps he was a person in the midst of a horde of daydreamers who had to keep quiet about his realism. International managers in virtually all the major countries live with constant handicaps, dreading that the players named will be pulled out of the squads, doubtful that clubs will blood native talent when it is safer to dip into the cosmopolitan marketplace. Qualifiers for a European Championship are a barely-tolerated nuisance for those whose jobs depend on results in the Premiership or Champions League. This is an environment that Steve McClaren, after his years at Manchester United and Middlesbrough, understands perfectly. By his reckoning the single chance to prepare the England side intensively for the test in Tel Aviv will come on Thursday. That, by and large, is what he anticipated. The manager, none the less, must be bemused when he hears the public complaining about his men. The manager is wise enough to keep his views to himself, knowing how unacceptable they are when the passion for England has hit such a peak that even the friendly with Spain could pull in around eight million viewers for the BBC. In reality, none the less, his immediate aims have to be narrow in scope. McClaren deserves to be faulted so far not for any failure to deliver expansive displays as for an inability to get the basics right. A scuffling draw with Macedonia at home, for example, would have been slated yet tolerated if it could have been converted into a tawdry win. An England manager, with no signings to be made, is as entitled to tolerance as that extended to, say, Jose Mourinho and Rafael Ben\u00edtez on dour afternoons. McClaren is in trouble primarily because the tactics have been unproductive.

She was a woman of immense bravery, and believed that fierce criticism of Israel &quot;is the best act of solidarity and compassion with the Jews that one can have&quot;. She was born in Israel, and brought up in Haifa by her mother, a communist and single parent. At the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, she gained a BA in philosophy and Hebrew literature in 1967 followed by an MA in philosophy and comparative literature. She was politically active with both the Communist party and the Young Communist league. She went to study in the US, and in 1976 gained a PhD in linguistics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where her supervisor was Noam Chomsky. On hearing of her death, he described her as an &quot;old and cherished friend&quot; and paid tribute both to her academic work and the political writing on her own society, which &quot;drew away the veil that concealed criminal and outrageous actions and shone a searing light on the reality that was obscured&quot;. Reinhart taught at Tel Aviv University for more than 20 years, and held a chair as professor of linguistics and cultural studies. She was a multi-disciplinarian and also taught and published on art, literature and media studies. Those who attended her media studies lectures remember how, amid fierce debate, students&apos; mindsets and lives were changed by her analysis, encouraging them to read between the lines of their country&apos;s writers. Her moral indignation flared quickly, but she was also given to long and patient discussions with her students. She taught too at MIT; Columbia University, New York; the University of Paris; and for 15 years was linked to the University of Utrecht. Her contribution to linguistic theory lay in the connection between meaning and context and the interface between syntax and systems of sound. Her most recent academic book, Interface Strategies, was published last year, and she was on the editorial board of several academic journals in various linguistic disciplines. Reaching to other audiences, she was a columnist for the Israeli paper Yediot Aharnot and for the radical online magazine, Counterpunch. Her most recent political book, The Roadmap to Nowhere, was also published last year. She came to see parallels with apartheid South Africa, writing in 2003: &quot;What Israel is doing under Ariel Sharon far exceeds the crimes of the South Africa&apos;s white regime. It has been taking the form of systematic ethnic cleansing, which South Africa never attempted.&quot; It was the analogy between Israel and South Africa&apos;s apartheid that she used in justifying the academic boycott movement of recent years. With great understatement she commented, also in 2003: &quot;It is not easy for an Israeli academic to support the calls for boycott of Israeli academic institutions these days. Like any other segment of the Israeli society, the universities are paying the price of Israel&apos;s war against the Palestinians, with severe budget cuts and deteriorating research conditions. A freeze of the EU funds would, no doubt, make things even tougher. It is therefore understandable that the Israeli academia is mobilising its forces to attack any such boycott attempt. Understandable, but not just.&quot; Reinhart&apos;s passionate calls for justice for the Palestinians made her a sought-after speaker internationally, and last October she gave the Edward Said Memorial lecture at Adelaide University in Australia. In her memorable final speech in France, last December at the R\u00e9sistances bookshop in Paris, she roundly denounced the embargo imposed on the Palestinians since the election of a Hamas government in January 2006. European countries, including France, she said, had no right to cut off food supplies to the Palestinians. &quot;It was not an act of generosity which Europe could either carry on or not - Europe chose not to force Israel to respect its obligations under international law.&quot; She was not only a writer, but also a frontline activist. Over the years she organised solidarity campaigns with Palestinian academics at Birzeit University on the West Bank, and against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Many friends and colleagues described countless visits with her to the occupied Palestinian territories, and the demonstrations and detentions which were part of them. Her like-minded academic colleagues, Avraham Oz and Ilan Pappe, are feeling &quot;orphaned&quot; by her sudden death. Most recently she was active in protests against the building of the long partition wall and the annexing of Palestinian land for it. She never tired of taking visitors to see the reality of lost livelihoods and unviable lives the wall has created for tens of thousands of Palestinians literally immured in villages without land in the latest Israeli scheme to create facts on the ground and prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state. Reinhart was an optimist however, and last October wrote that &quot;persistent struggle can have an effect, and can lead governments to act. Such struggle begins with the Palestinian people, who have withstood years of brutal oppression, and who, through their spirit of zumud - sticking to their land - and daily endurance, organising and resistance, have managed to keep the Palestinian cause alive, something that not all oppressed nations have managed to do.&quot; She also believed in the modest role of international solidarity movements, &quot;that send their people to the occupied territories and stand in vigils at home, professors signing boycott petitions, subjecting themselves to daily harassment, a few courageous journalists that insist on covering the truth, against the pressure of acquiescent media and pro-Israel lobbies. Often this struggle for justice seems futile. Nevertheless, it has penetrated global consciousness.&quot; In 2006 she was ousted by what she felt to be bureaucratic harassment from her post at Tel Aviv University, and with great regret decided to leave Israel. She died in her sleep in New York, where she had immediately been offered a teaching post at New York University.

A comparatively small number of withdrawals must have improved his morale, but the manager was already confident that he himself is better equipped for the job now than he was at the outset. What brought about this improvement in the post? &quot;Just the experience of it,&quot; McClaren said. &quot;We started the first three games and everything was hunky dory, but I said the job will start when we lose. We got beaten, the job started. We have learned a lot since then. I have.&quot; There has been no competitive fixture since that miserable defeat in Croatia, but opportunities to raise spirits in subsequent friendlies were wasted, with a tolerable draw with Holland followed by the defeat to Spain at Old Trafford. It is a matter of urgency that McClaren&apos;s team make the most of what talents they do possess. That will be the theme as he holds his first team meeting today. &quot;We had a disappointing World Cup,&quot; he said. &quot;Since then we have had disappointing games. There is ability, potential in that side to be better than we are at the moment. We have got to go out and prove it.&quot; This well-worn topic has been handled by so many of his predecessors, but the capacity to make talent tell is a topic of endless relevance. On Monday, 10 members of the party came through a pair of FA Cup quarter-finals more or less unscathed and McClaren had the luxury of reflecting on the decisiveness of gifted players. &quot;In a very tight game, what is the difference?&quot; he asked &quot;The difference is a world-class striker turning on a sixpence and hitting the ball in the top corner; it wins you a match.&quot; That reference to Andriy Shevchenko&apos;s opener in Chelsea&apos;s 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur was followed by thoughts of the man who earned the penalty with which Manchester United beat Middlesbrough. &quot;You look at [Cristiano] Ronaldo, a special player wins you games. We have those players with England.&quot; It is the final assertion that remains contentious while England have appeared so laboured, but McClaren is adamant that he does possess such individuals. As he implores them &quot;to step forward in the big games&quot; thoughts turn, as ever, to Wayne Rooney. In Tel Aviv he will face the defender Tal Ben Haim, with whom Rooney tangled in an incident during Manchester United&apos;s fixture with Bolton on Boxing Day 2004 that led to a disputed three-game ban for the forward. The players have met several times since then, but the Euro 2008 fixture could disinter old resentments. &quot;We need to play with controlled aggression, steely resolve,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;Wayne can do that. That is part of his make-up. You wouldn&apos;t want to take that away from him, away from any of them, because that is what we will need in Israel.&quot; McClaren admits to having been frustrated in the preparations for the Spain friendly, when there were many withdrawals, and throughout the match itself. He had a specific regret that Everton&apos;s Andrew Johnson could not be risked then. &quot;I like AJ,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;He&apos;s a team player. You need those players. People were saying [in the draw with Holland], &apos;AJ with his talent was playing right wing, running all the way back&apos;, but I looked at Chelsea [against Tottenham] and Drogba was making tackles on the edge of the box. Strikers have to work as hard as anyone in the team. AJ does it. Defenders don&apos;t like that to defend against.&quot; With the uncapped David Nugent called up because of Darren Bent&apos;s knee injury, McClaren&apos;s options up front are limited in any case. The manager is optimistic about Jonathan Woodgate and Micah Richards, whose injury problems seem to be minor. The sole absentee whose loss McClaren could really rue is Gary Neville. The manager is intent on underlining the value of experience when he selects his line-up and faint reservations about Richards&apos; fitness could be compounded by doubts over the readiness of a teenager. That would lead naturally to the choice of Phil Neville and Jamie Carragher at full-back. McClaren is happy with this group and all that England lack is excuses ahead of a match of great importance.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-21T01:01:26Z", "title": "McClaren calls on England to prove talent", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv he will face the defender Tal Ben Haim, with whom Rooney tangled in an incident during Manchester United&apos;s fixture with Bolton on Boxing Day 2004 that led to a disputed three-game ban for the forward."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/21/newsstory.sport8"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "The morning after the night before and Frank Lampard could be found fielding questions from his England team-mates about where he learned self-defence. &quot;Not bad, was I?&quot; said the Chelsea midfielder of the moment when a Tottenham supporter ran on to the pitch and threw a punch in his direction. Footballers tend to dilute serious incidents with humour but beneath the smile Lampard was still shaken as he reported to Steve McClaren&apos;s squad at Arsenal&apos;s training ground. &quot;You don&apos;t expect something like that to happen,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m just pleased that I managed to get out of the way of it and that nothing serious came out of what could have been a really bad situation. It was a worrying incident and it could have been a lot worse.&quot; Lampard welcomed the news that Spurs have imposed a lifetime ban on his would-be assailant and he expects the incident to lead to a review of security not just at White Hart Lane, but also at other grounds throughout the country. &quot;We have to set a precedent now and make sure we don&apos;t let it happen again,&quot; he said. &quot;The authorities are treating it seriously and I&apos;m sure they will want to make sure it never happens again. People talk about the fact we were celebrating in front of the fans and getting stick from the supporters. But that&apos;s perfectly normal in football. It is part of the game. What happened in this case, however, was over-stepping the mark. I hope it doesn&apos;t happen again - as simple as that.&quot; In many ways the differing emotions at White Hart Lane - the euphoria of making it to the FA Cup semi-finals and the shock of being attacked by a pitch invader - encapsulate Lampard&apos;s season: a graph of highs and lows in which he has been linked with moves from Chelsea to Europe, although yesterday Juventus denied being interested in him, and questions being asked about his ability to transfer club form to international level. Lampard has been one of McClaren&apos;s more disappointing performers but his displays in a Chelsea shirt have been consistently impressive since the turn of the year and with 20 goals to his name already, he seemed a relaxed figure yesterday as he prepared for Saturday&apos;s game in Israel. &quot;It&apos;s a strange one with England because our recent results haven&apos;t been great, but I&apos;m feeling pretty confident,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not thinking about our defeats against Croatia and Spain, but about how we [Chelsea] have been doing in the last few weeks and we&apos;ve been doing well, as have the boys with Manchester United. &quot;There are a lot of players who are coming into this squad with confidence and it&apos;s important we don&apos;t start thinking negatively about past results and performances. It&apos;s important we&apos;re positive and think about what we want to do. &quot;As for me personally, I feel pretty good - as good now as I have felt at any part of the season. I could have done without the incident at the end of the Tottenham game. But form-wise, I&apos;m very happy. That&apos;s a big bonus. Even though we&apos;ve had a big pile-up of games at Chelsea, it isn&apos;t a problem for me.&quot; Once described by Sir Alex Ferguson as a &quot;freak&quot; because of the way he never seems to suffer from fatigue, Lampard&apos;s durability has been invaluable in a season in which Chelsea have aspirations of winning all four major competitions. On Saturday he will be paired in central midfield with the fit-again Owen Hargreaves while Steven Gerrard moves out to the right, a formation that McClaren believes will give Lampard licence to press forward and support Wayne Rooney and Andrew Johnson. Despite being England&apos;s leading scorer in the World Cup qualifying with five goals, Lampard has yet to score in the Euro 2008 games and has managed only one goal in his last 12 appearances. &quot;It&apos;d be great to start scoring again, but I&apos;m old enough and wise enough to know that goals don&apos;t always come consistently,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem when you&apos;re playing for England and find yourself on a run of not scoring is that it becomes a case of &apos;He hasn&apos;t scored for 10 or 12 months.&apos; Which is true, of course, but the fact is we don&apos;t play that many times a year. I just want to score in important games for England and what better place than in a hard away game, where an odd goal could win it.&quot; Lampard has memories of playing in Israel when Chelsea were drawn against Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Uefa Cup in 2001. A spate of terrorism attacks led to six Chelsea players requesting to stay behind but Lampard was among those to travel and he remembers &quot;a very hot, heated atmosphere&quot;.

However, that did not stop Woodgate taking part in light training at the new Wembley Stadium this afternoon, as he joined his colleagues in a gentle warm-up. Richards stayed at pitchside but did not join in as his calf was again assessed by England&apos;s medical team.

Clubs will no longer be able to offer players contracts of less than one year, while players will have the right to be paid monthly and take days off. Chelsea fans are planning a major protest after being pressured to renew their season tickets despite ongoing uncertainty at the club. One group of corporate supporters has even prepared an advert for Lahn&apos;s Lahn E&apos;ning Stannah, urging fans not to renew until there is &quot;clarity on Mourinho, Terry and Lampard&quot;. Fair play - we wouldn&apos;t pay \u00a34,000 a year to watch those three gougers either.

Day after day I&apos;ve read your attacks on basically everything in English football, mostly our best players, in a feeble attempt at humour, but this time you&apos;ve gone too far. The implication that the players were somehow to blame and sarcastic remarks amount pitch invasions are irresponsible journalism and ill-thought out. I really wish this was going to the boss of the Guardian. My parting message to you? Resign. Join a tabloid&quot; - Mr D Daly. &quot;When a Stoke fan attacked QPR goalkeeper Simon Royce last season and landed a few blows before the Rangers squad fell on him, QPR got a fine for failing to keep control of their players and reserve goalkeeper Jake Cole picked up a ban for administering a good shoeing while the bloke was on the floor. Step forward a year and a Spurs fan, clearly so drunk that even fat Frank could evade him, finds himself buried under a heap of Chelsea players. Of these, Ashley Cole and Didier Drogba, amongst others, are performing a strange dance not unrelated to the Hokey Cokey. We can only hope the unfortunate fan wasn&apos;t in their way. And is the FA feeling the collars of those Chelsea players? Or the management team that failed to control them? Apparently not. Double standards, anyone?&quot; - FWB. &quot;Fiver readers should forgive Nigel Keane for being stupid (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters) as his reference to Beckham not being able to walk across the Bering Sea unless there is a sudden new ice age is utterly wrong. In March 2006, Karl Bushby and Dimitri Kieffer crossed it on foot, walking across a frozen 56 mile section in 15 days&quot; - Michael Russell-Yarde. &quot;Am I the only one to notice the FA&apos;s lightning fast reaction to Fat Frank not getting &apos;assaulted&apos;, and its demand for a quick response and action from the relevant clubs, as opposed to its glacial pace when having to do anything itself or dealing with its own flaws and problems? No? Thought not&quot; - Paul Jurdeczka. &quot;So Gareth Southgate refuses to condemn his staff for calling Cristiano Ronaldo a cheat, because &apos;in the heat of the moment, everybody is entitled to a reaction&apos;. I don&apos;t recall him being so forgiving when Roy Keane stamped on his chest during an FA Cup semi-final. And I&apos;m sure he wouldn&apos;t have approved of some of the things I was calling him after his penalty miss in Euro 96. Double standards, surely?&quot; - Ryan MacDonald.

Steve McClaren was in awe of the Liverpool centre-half&apos;s displays against Manchester United and Barcelona but it would not have occurred to the England manager to pick him for that position in Tel Aviv. Carragher himself jokes about the misfortune of having all the country&apos;s world-class players in his preferred position. It is easy enough for him to be good-humoured since he is no England discard. A 33rd appearance will come his way at the Ramat Gan stadium and when he says that &quot;hopefully I can get a few more&quot; he must have the 50-cap landmark in mind. He is expected to face Israel at left-back, with Phil Neville perhaps earmarked for the right, where he has been used regularly by Everton. The enforced versatility of Carragher reflects not just the calibre of the other candidates but also the fact that he settled in that post comparatively late. The opportunity to establish himself in the middle of the Liverpool defence came in 2004, when he was 26, as he took over from Stephane Henchoz to partner Sami Hyypia. There is no resentment over his status as a utility player with England and he can get effusive about the men who are the automatic choice at the heart of the back four. &quot;You can&apos;t really argue,&quot; he said. &quot;For me John Terry is the best centre-half in the world and Rio Ferdinand is a \u00a330m defender, so I&apos;m in no position to complain. I hope I can learn from them. I&apos;m always trying to improve.&quot; It was not obligatory for Carragher to launch into a tribute quite as enthusiastic as that and there is no cause to believe that versatility has been his curse, because his capacity to fill the left-back slot allowed him to be prominent as Liverpool took the League Cup, FA Cup and Uefa Cup in 2001. As recently as last summer, too, he featured in four of England&apos;s five fixtures in the World Cup, starting two of them while deputising for the injured Gary Neville. Despite the apparent flexibility, it is no simple task to work the left flank, even if can stick to a relatively conservative approach against Israel while Aaron Lennon inspires dashing attacks ahead of him. &quot;At the World Cup you could tell the difference with trying to get up and down the pitch,&quot; he said. &quot;Centre-back takes more out of you mentally than physically.&quot; There may well be a demand for conservatism in Tel Aviv and Carragher is far from gung-ho in his view of the Euro 2008 qualifier. &quot;We don&apos;t want to lose,&quot; he said. &quot;If we win we&apos;re not definitely qualified. We don&apos;t want to put on pressure by saying that if we lose that&apos;s the end. There&apos;s still seven games to be played after it. It&apos;s big but it&apos;s not the be-all and end-all.&quot; Even so the significance of the fixture is not lost on him. He likes to draw a parallel with the circumstances of his club&apos;s win at Camp Nou. &quot;Before Barcelona, people were saying that Liverpool&apos;s season may be over. It&apos;s those type of matches that you&apos;re in the game for.&quot; By the same token he expects that England&apos;s uncertain position in Group E will &quot;give us a boost&quot; at kick-off on Saturday. &quot;Israel away was always going to be difficult. Obviously we&apos;d like to have had a few more points on the board. That makes it a bit more difficult than it was at the start. &quot;They&apos;re going to put us under a lot of pressure and there will be a hostile crowd. The players are used to it. Hopefully we can take the performances our teams have given in Europe this season and take that on to the international level.&quot; This, of course, is exactly where the side have failed. Individuals durable enough to get Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United into the Champions League quarter-finals were all culpable as England lost in Croatia. &quot;It&apos;s part of playing for England,&quot; Carragher says phlegmatically. A sense of humour is also of assistance. He broke off from routine comments about how well Liverpool had prepared for the Barcelona fixtures to add: &quot;We had a good training camp in Portugal.&quot; The mischievous reference was to the golf-club dispute between Craig Bellamy and John Arne Riise on the Algarve.

Arveladze, now playing for AZ Alkmaar, returned an impressive 44 goals from 74 league starts in Scotland, ensuring McLeish and Watson are perfectly aware of the 34-year-old&apos;s ability to pose their team problems in the vital Euro 2008 qualifier. &quot;I think Shota is a top-drawer player, fantastic,&quot; said Watson, McLeish&apos;s assistant in the national set-up who performed the same role at Ibrox. &quot;He is a great thinker, has great technique and great movement. I think he always carried a threat in games, there was always a possibility he would score. He did well for Rangers; at times he had injuries, and that maybe curtailed him, but the football in Holland maybe isn&apos;t as physically demanding as it is here. There was never a doubt over his technical qualities. How he has gone on and performed confirms why we would have liked to keep him at Rangers for longer.&quot; The forward, who has also served Ajax, has indeed proved a consistent performer on the club and international front since departing Glasgow two years ago. Arveladze scored in both legs of Alkmaar&apos;s recent spectacular Uefa Cup victory over Newcastle United; evidence that his appetite for the big occasion has not diminished despite claiming seven winner&apos;s medals at Rangers. Another familiar Georgian face to Watson and McLeish will be Zurab Khizanishvili, the Blackburn Rovers defender who joined Rangers from Dundee in 2003. Unlike Arveladze, Khizanishvili failed to perform to the best of his abilities at Ibrox, starting only 39 league games in three years, but Watson dismissed any suggestion the 25-year-old is an enigma. &quot;If that&apos;s the case, then he&apos;s an enigma who has kept doing well and won trophies,&quot; added McLeish&apos;s assistant. Watson admitted that Saturday&apos;s opponents are an unknown quantity to the Scotland staff. Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller&apos;s side defeated the Faroe Islands 6-0 in a qualifying match but subsequently lost nine goals in three games against the top seeds in the group - France, Italy and Ukraine - before recording impressive friendly victories over Uruguay and Turkey. Toppm\u00f6ller&apos;s options have been restricted by the withdrawal of the Milan defender Kakha Kaladze through injury while Scotland&apos;s Nigel Quashie yesterday returned to his club, West Ham United, because of ankle trouble. Scotland sit proudly at the summit of their section, a situation that would continue with a home victory over the Georgians, and Watson knows his players also have the opportunity to strike a significant blow against another of the teams who are seeking to split the more illustrious top three nations. &quot;First and foremost we have an opportunity to stay top of the group by taking care of our own situation and getting three points,&quot; Watson said. &quot;But the flip side is that we could effectively knock out one of our opponents for qualification.&quot; The Rangers striker Kris Boyd has urged McLeish to pair him with Celtic&apos;s Kenny Miller, rather than playing him as a lone attacker, against Georgia. &quot;I feel as though I&apos;m more suited to playing with someone beside me,&quot; said Boyd. &quot;I&apos;ve done the task myself on my own before, in the [Rangers] game against Hapoel Tel Aviv, and we beat them comfortably that night. So I can do it and, if it happens again, I&apos;ll be looking forward to that as well.&quot; Scotland are level on points with France at the top and 16th in the Fifa world rankings, their highest position, but Boyd insisted they would not wilt under the pressure over the next seven days. &quot;I&apos;m at a club where there is pressure on you every week to get results,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether it be a Wednesday, a Thursday or a Saturday that we&apos;re playing, we need to win every game. &quot;Coming away with Scotland is no different and I&apos;m looking forward to the challenge on Saturday if I&apos;m playing.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-03-22T00:32:14Z", "title": "Scotland braced for return of old friend Arveladze", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;ve done the task myself on my own before, in the [Rangers] game against Hapoel Tel Aviv, and we beat them comfortably that night."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/22/newsstory.sport4"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "There was an unusual tranquillity to the England scene yesterday.

Any current reservations concern players who were unlikely to start Saturday&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel. Micah Richards, who has a calf problem, took no part in the session and misgivings about his condition had already been underlined by the call-up for Luke Young, the Charlton right-back who has not been capped since the 3-2 win over Argentina in November 2005. Jonathan Woodgate&apos;s knee injury could not prevent him from getting on to the pitch, even if the Middlesbrough defender stayed there merely for the warm-up. David Nugent was on the Wembley surface three days earlier than he had anticipated, having supposed that he would not appear there until England&apos;s Under-21 international with Italy on Saturday, the first game at the rebuilt ground. The Preston striker was brought in as a replacement for Charlton&apos;s Darren Bent, who continues to have knee trouble. It was, however, the England goalkeeping coach Ray Clemence, a man with many memories of the old Wembley, who got his studs into the pitch first when the squad arrived yesterday. England fly out to Tel Aviv this afternoon with a squad of 24 now that Young has been added. McClaren has seemed optimistic about the recoveries of Woodgate and Richards.

The entire World Cup squad announced they would retire from international football after being offered only \u00a3485 for their participation in the tournament despite their belief that a multi-million-dollar sponsorship agreement had been agreed with Adidas last year. Though they withdrew that threat, they are now preparing a court action against the Trinidad &amp; Tobago football federation over the payments. T&amp;T is a world football power, on account of the federation&apos;s financier, Jack Warner, the Fifa vice-president who was also re-elected as president of its continent&apos;s Concacaf confederation last week. That election triumph came amid turmoil in his own constituency. The T&amp;TFF had announced eight days previously that all forms of football were to be cancelled due to funding difficulties, although the situation was rescued following government intervention. The T&amp;T&apos;s players want to know where the Adidas money went and are calling for transparency in the federation&apos;s accounting. &quot;It is hard to believe it when they say only eight months after playing at the highest level of world football that the federation is bankrupt,&quot; said Brent Sancho, the Gillingham and T&amp;T defender. The players fear that some of their number have already been blacklisted for international selection, a factor that could affect future work-permit applications to play in the UK leagues. It is felt that only through union representation can they ensure their rights are secured. With advice from English football unionist Kev Harrison, the players have organised a fundraising launch event at the Hackney Empire this evening. New crackdown on touts The government&apos;s war on ticket touting will open a new front next Tuesday. John Robertson, the Labour MP for Glasgow North West, has kicked off a debate that will lead to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport considering a proposal for a list of protected events for which no tickets may be sold at more than face value. Measures preventing the resale of tickets are already enshrined in law for football and come into force from next month. The basis for football to be defended was initially to guarantee segregation of fans, because scalpers opened a back door to mixed spectating. Consumer-protection issues came to light only when the government learnt of the extortionate mark-ups in internet ticket resales. But football fans are not alone in suffering ticket-tout rip-offs and this has led to calls for a list of &quot;crown jewels&quot; events for which similar laws should be introduced. A precedent is already in place with the prescription of free-to-air broadcasting of certain sporting events. Notionally it is hoped that Six Nations rugby, Test and one-day cricket matches, the Wimbledon tennis championships, rugby league&apos;s Challenge Cup final and racing&apos;s Grand National and Derby will all benefit from restrictions on ticket resale pricing. Real try to protect rights Real Madrid have employed lobbyists to tackle MEPs opposed to individual bargaining for television rights. A report will be voted on by the European parliament next Wednesday and one of the clauses it contained warned that clubs selling their own TV rights (as Real do) as opposed to doing so collectively (such as in the Premiership) &quot;threaten completely to destroy competitive balance&quot;. The lobbyists&apos; fees were money well spent: Madrid got their way when this clause was excised from the final text. But then they can afford it. Last year their budget was \u20ac346m compared with Seville&apos;s \u20ac30m and Real Zaragoza&apos;s \u20ac35m.

Seven months after Liverpool manager Rafa Ben\u00edtez deemed it &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; to take his team to Israel to play Maccabi Haifa in the Champions League, the biggest match ever on Israeli soil is about to take place. Last summer&apos;s Lebanon war was the latest in a long list of events that have caused sporting events to be switched to safer shores for security reasons. But with the country experiencing a period of relative calm, England&apos;s footballers will face Israel in a vital clash in Tel Aviv on Saturday. The match will see issues of loyalty and patriotism take centre stage for Jewish football fans, both in England and in Israel. The European Championships qualifier is the first competitive match between the two national teams. They are tied on seven points in their qualifying group, and each is desperate for points in order to close the gap on leaders Croatia. England&apos;s only previous games against Israel were two friendlies in Tel Aviv in the mid-1980s, and the gulf between the two sides has narrowed greatly since then. For most fans at the Ramat Gan Stadium, there can be no doubt who they will be singing their hearts out for. Native Israelis, or Sabras, will don the blue and white of their flag, neck a few bottles of Goldstar, the local beer, and get behind their team of underdogs. As for the few thousand England fans who decide to brave the heavily armed Israeli security forces at Ben Gurion airport, they will be roaring on their squad of underachieving prima donnas, desperate to see the iron of the English lion in Zion. But, dotted around the stands, in the bars of Ramat Gan, and in the pubs of north-west London, there will be the torn. When it comes to the crunch - assuming a football match is the closest these two allied states will come to war - whose colours will they cheer? Football has deeply penetrated Jewish society in England. British Jews predominantly live in cities such as London and Manchester; hence large numbers of them support football teams such as Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United. Their support reaches to the upper echelons of some clubs, with Jews prominent on the boards of Arsenal, Spurs, Watford and Oldham Athletic. There are several Jewish football leagues in London and Manchester, for both youngsters and adults, which attract fiercely competitive players. The upcoming match has stimulated much debate in the community, with some surprising declarations of support. Affinity towards Israel is not a given, even among Jewish emigres to Israel. &quot;I have a passion for both the England and Tottenham teams that I could never have for Israel&apos;s squad,&quot; says Jonny Hadi, 26, a London-born Jew living in Israel. His loyalty to England&apos;s footballers is unswerving, regardless of where he resides. &quot;Even after I&apos;d made aliya [emigrated to Israel], I still went to Euro 2004 with the England fans and had a fantastic time backing the boys.&quot; He puts his allegiance down to a &quot;gut feeling - it&apos;s nothing against Israel. The fact is, I&apos;m an Englishman living in Israel, and I doubt that I will ever feel differently.&quot; When asked if he thought it strange to have opted to emigrate from England to Israel, yet still support the team of the country he spurned, Hadi disagrees. &quot;If I was an Englishman living in Germany or France, there&apos;s no one who would expect me not to support England.&quot; Lawrence Peterman, a London stockbroker, believes that his religious beliefs have no bearing on his allegiances in the match. &quot;Yes, I&apos;m Jewish, but I&apos;m not Israeli,&quot; he says, when asked why he&apos;d be supporting England. &quot;I was born here and have spent the past 41 years here, so my affinity will always be to my home country.&quot; Peterman says he is not alone: &quot;All of my Jewish friends will be supporting England,&quot; he says. &quot;While we consider ourselves very Jewish in the traditional sense, it does not translate to our necessarily being very Zionist.&quot; The distinction is important, especially in the context of the &quot;Tebbit test&quot;, which reared its head once more in the wake of the 7/7 bombings in London. Where do the true loyalties of Britain&apos;s ethnic minorities lie? There is a misconception that ethnic minorities treat Britain as no more than a host nation, where they can reap the benefits of a western lifestyle, yet have no need to show loyalty to the state. &quot;While I am now an Israeli - and thus supporting Israel&apos;s footballers - I have a lot of love and respect for the UK,&quot; says David Horovitz, editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post. &quot;My father&apos;s family fled Germany in 1937 and found refuge in Britain. My father served in the RAF during the war, and I have overwhelmingly fond memories of my time in England. That said, I will be cheering on Israel with my heart and soul during the match.&quot; To complicate things further, Horovitz sees no inconsistency between supporting Israel against England, and being a lifelong Arsenal fan (as are his two sons). &quot;If England score, I&apos;ll be cheering - but it&apos;ll be tinged with guilt,&quot; says Jamie Levy, who is flying to Tel Aviv from London for the match yet sitting with the Israel fans at the stadium. &quot;There&apos;s definitely a conflict of interest, since I&apos;ve got a tremendous affinity for Israel, but I&apos;ve supported the England team all my life. There&apos;s no question of switching sides - it&apos;d be as heinous a sin as going from Spurs to Arsenal.&quot; The match will also be a launching pad for a campaign to tackle racism in Israeli football. The notorious level of xenophobic sentiment at Israeli stadiums is something that British-born Dan Berelowitz is working hard to eradicate. After spending a gap year in Israel, he returned to the UK and now works on the New Israel Fund&apos;s project Kick Racism Out of Israeli Football. Israel&apos;s national league has been dogged by racist incidents for years - particularly at Betar Jerusalem&apos;s Teddy Stadium. The club, whose roots can be traced back to the rightwing nationalist movement of the same name, has a hardcore of anti-Arab fans. Clashes between Betar supporters and those of Israeli-Arab team Bnei Sakhnin were both violent and frequent, until the latter were relegated last season. Racism remains an issue in the English Premiership, and earlier this month the Metropolitan Police and the Football Assocation opened investigations into alleged anti-semitism on West Ham&apos;s terraces. Several Israelis play in the Premiership, including teen sensation Ben Sahar of Chelsea, who is in the Israel squad facing England. From Ronny Rosenthal at Liverpool in the 90s, to Yossi Benayoun at West Ham today, the English leagues have provided an important platform for the best Israeli players to develop and shine, and the New Israel Fund used this connection when garnering support. Berelowitz is keen to dispel the notion that Jews - whether English or not - should blindly support Israel out of a sense of loyalty. &quot;I certainly don&apos;t think that all Jews should root for Israel unquestioningly, in the same way I think that believing in anything unquestioningly can lead to dangerous fanaticism,&quot; he says. But his support for Israel isn&apos;t all down to either his work or his religion: &quot;England&apos;s performances irritate me.

My lack of concern has little to do with living in France, where most people will, naturally, be more bothered about events in Lithuania. When I eventually find out what happened, I will be disappointed if England have lost or drawn, and quite pleased if they have won. But that&apos;s it. The result from Tel Aviv will have no lasting impact to match the joy of hearing Sunderland have won, or the injured feelings I suffer when they are beaten in a game on which absolutely nothing depends. Come to think of it, Israel 2, England 0 on Saturday evening would be a great deal less disappointing than Leeds Reserves 2, Sunderland Reserves 0 - a score line that denied us the 2001 Premiership Reserve League title. Club v country is a contest, for this fan, with only one outcome. Many England supporters will be horrified at the thought, but am I completely alone? Perhaps not every club fan would think seriously about getting from London to a midweek reserve game - only the problem of catching a train back, in the end, defeated that slightly pathetic plan in 2001 - but we do represent a sizeable minority. Despite the early promise of the Quinn/Keane Revolution, the identity of my club naturally provides a complete answer to any suspicion of glory-seeking. But it wouldn&apos;t necessarily come as a big surprise to find a Man Utd fan who preferred the Red Devils to England, whether or not that fan had ever been to Manchester, or indeed England. But my guess is that for every one of those Torquay United or Grimsby Town banners you see among England supporters, there is at least one follower of each club who cares much more about its results than about those of the national team, at whatever level the club happens to be playing. The reasons will differ. My own disenchantment with the national side stems to a large extent from close encounters, as a reporter, with another sizeable minority: the hooligan element (among the fans, I should add, not the hoolie-watching reporters). Every club has a yob contingent. It might vary, but 5% or 10% sounds about right. If I am correct in believing that virtually all these hooligans also support England, then the percentage of yobs drawn to internationals is likely to be many times higher. I will forget the outcome of Saturday&apos;s game in Israel a lot more quickly than I will forget how much nicer Belgium seemed in 2000 after England&apos;s early elimination. Charleroi may not have been the world war three depicted in some television coverage at the time. But what happened there the day we played Germany - and, more emphatically, what had taken place the night before in Brussels as our fans began to arrive - was deeply unpleasant and shaming. A lot has been achieved, especially at club level, to curb match-day violence. Worse things probably happen these days in France and elsewhere in Europe than they do in or around English stadiums. But the reality of England&apos;s support, in particular its travelling (and often ticketless) support, is that among lots of decent and passionate fans remains an obnoxious core of young and sometimes not-so-young men who either actively seek trouble or are happy to be sucked in to any that kicks off. It will take more than the encouraging signs from last year&apos;s World Cup finals in Germany to convince me that this is already an issue of the past. The biggest cloud over my weekend is not, therefore, the possibility of an England setback in Tel Aviv, but the certainty of a cancelled league programme, which means I have no score to look out for.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-22T15:00:40Z", "title": "Cry God for Niall, Sunderland and St Roy!", "sentences": ["The result from Tel Aviv will have no lasting impact to match the joy of hearing Sunderland have won, or the injured feelings I suffer when they are beaten in a game on which absolutely nothing depends.", "The biggest cloud over my weekend is not, therefore, the possibility of an England setback in Tel Aviv, but the certainty of a cancelled league programme, which means I have no score to look out for."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/22/thesportswritersarealready"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Middlesbrough"], "article": "Just when Jonathan Woodgate was beginning to believe his injury problems were behind him, a sore knee meant that he did not board England&apos;s flight to Tel Aviv yesterday.

As short as 5-1 prior to their opening fixture, against Andorra, Steve McClaren&apos;s side can now be backed at 8-1 with Skybet after winning only once since hammering the Group E minnows 5-0. A home draw against Macedonia followed by defeat by Croatia in Zagreb has forced the layers to push England out in the outright market and in the group betting, where they are now 15-8 with Skybet to top the section. Croatia are favourites at 11-10 with Coral. England are still expected to qualify for the finals, with William Hill quoting 2-5 they do and 7-4 they do not. McClaren is a 2-1 shot with Hill&apos;s to be out of his job by the time the finals kick off in Austria and Switzerland. A win in Tel Aviv tomorrow would see those qualification odds tumble inwards. However, although all of our featured bookmakers make England odds-on favourites (5-6 is the best price to be had), the task is no easy one. Though Israel, generally 7-2 to win, failed to qualify for the last World Cup but no team beat them in a group that contained France, Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland. Like England they have seven points from four games but with tough away games to come they are 50-1 shots with Ladbrokes to win the group. Dror Kashtan saw his side lose 4-3 at home to Croatia in their last competitive match and might see tomorrow&apos;s game as a must-win. But even at 7-2 a home victory does not represent any value. Neither does the draw, which is best-priced at 23-10 with Blue Square. The match looks certain to be tight and, though Israel&apos;s two home matches have yielded 12 goals , there is a case to be made for backing less than three goals in the game at 8-13 with Blue Square. International matches rarely produce lots of goals and this is especially the case when England play away from home. Neither of their away matches in this qualification campaign has produced more than two goals and only one of five in the World Cup finals and two of five qualifi ers en route to Germany did so. &quot;First player to score&quot; punters have latched on to the fact that Andrew Johnson is a probable starter alongside Wayne Rooney . The Everton striker is a general 6-1 shot to score the first goal with Rooney best at 11-2 with Blue Square and Hill&apos;s. Injuries have led to a rash of late call-ups, with David Nugent&apos;s inclusion prompting a number of special bets from the layers. Hill&apos;s off er 9-4 that the Preston striker will play some part of the match and Totesport will lay you 7-4 that Nugent makes the squad for the Euro 2008 finals. The Republic of Ireland and Wales have had wretched starts to their campaigns, with neither looking likely to qualify (Hill&apos;s rate them as 7-1 and 8-1 shots respectively). They meet at Croke Park on Saturday with Steve Staunton&apos;s side a shade odds-on at 4-5 with Boyle Sports and Wales generally available at 4-1. Both have put in some awful performances over the past six months and will be desperate to restore pride, which suggests a draw. Steve McClaren&apos;s side travel to Israel for a vital qualifier with expectations low but good bets are still on offer Kevin Pullein Trendspotting It does not pay to expect a torrent of goals when a top international side faces a minnow at home or away might suit both teams.

Despite Scotland leading Group B the bookmakers are dismissive of their chances of staying there, with Bet365 quoting Alex McLeish&apos;s side at 25-1 to win the section and Hill&apos;s offering 13-2 that they will qualify for the finals. McLeish starts his tenure as manager with a home fixture against Georgia which the Scots are 4-9 with Blue Square to win. Georgia are best at 15-2 with Paddy Power while the draw is 10-3, again with Paddy Power. Though the inspirational Walter Smith is no longer in charge, with a home win over France on their CV Scotland should beat a Georgia side who have so far beaten only the Faroe Islands. A narrow home win is predicted with a correct-score punt of 1-0, generally on offer at 11-2, the advice. Northern Ireland are 4-9 with Better to beat Liechtenstein and the hosts are 10-3 with Bet365.

The growing number of Israeli players who have come to the Premiership is merely one reason, with Tal Ben Haim and Yossi Benayoun among the current crop. The Israeli agent Pini Zahavi has become an influential figure in transfers and boardrooms; Avraham Grant is coaching at Portsmouth and may soon find his way to Chelsea; and both nations have Russian oligarchs, with links to both countries, transforming their clubs. In the world of big money, international deals and talented Israelis, it is hardly surprising to find Zahavi&apos;s fingers in so many pies. He always had good connections in eastern Europe and now, when Russian money plays such an important role in Israeli and British football, he is the one who links everybody. Zahavi introduced Grant to Roman Abramovich, and Abramovich to Chelsea, and it would not be a surprise to find Grant at Stamford Bridge next season. Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, wanted Grant to join the coaching staff in January only for Jose Mourinho to give a stern ultimatum and refuse to part with his assistant, Steve Clarke. In Israel, Grant splits football fans. Some think he is charming, an outstanding coach and an asset to the country&apos;s sport, but others say he is a lucky, mediocre coach who will be found out sooner or later. All agree, though, that he has excellent media and man-management skills, just like Zahavi. With Zahavi influential at Portsmouth it was not surprising to find his friend Grant there, working under the title of technical director. It means that Grant, one of the five closest people to Abramovich, remains for now on the payroll of Alexandre Gaydamak, owner of Portsmouth and son of Arkady Gaydamak, the Russian-born owner of Beitar Jerusalem, the team who provide the backbone of the Israel side facing England tomorrow. Gaydamak Sr is not in Abramovich&apos;s league when it comes to wealth but in the past two years he has had more media attention in Israel than anyone. He made his money in France and Angola but was virtually unknown until July 2005 when he bought Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team (after being asked to do so by Ehud Olmert, now Israel&apos;s prime minister) and gave a donation to the then struggling Beitar side. Fifteen minutes later he had 50% of Beitar and 48 hours later he became the sole owner of the nationalistic right-wing club, and since then he has never left the headlines. Status-wise it was a shrewd investment, although Beitar have so far given him mainly grief. He claims not to understand the game but a storm is never far away from the team&apos;s lovely Teddy Kollek Stadium in Jerusalem. In less then two years he has had five managers, and other key jobs seem to change hands even faster. Although Beitar head the table he said, in a typical remark, that they would not win the championship. His son is enjoying success at Portsmouth this season but avoiding the media. He served as a sniper in the Israeli army and conducts his business in the same hidden manner. Gaydamak Jr has said that he bought Portsmouth with his own money but in Israel some doubt it. Abramovich does not have such a problem. He has enough to finance an annual Israel-Russian football tournament in Israel and has tried to get involved in the domestic league. Lev Leviev, a Tashkent-born Israeli billionaire, promised Abramovich he would buy Hapoel Tel Aviv last year. A strange mix: Leviev is a reclusive orthodox Jew whereas Hapoel are a secular left-leaning club with provocative fans. The deal fell through and Abramovich was said to be cross when he did not get his foot in Israeli football and Grant did not get the Hapoel coach&apos;s job. Other moguls checked the Israeli market but found it unattractive, so Gaydamak is the league&apos;s only oligarch. So far he has not had the Abramovich effect, more the Vladimir Romanov effect at Hearts. But he may yet make an impact on the English game: Beitar&apos;s main target is Benayoun.

Paul Robinson certainly fits that description going into the European Championship qualifier in Israel, though not in the way the term used to be applied to the likes of Bruce Grobbelaar and John Burridge. Robinson is mad in the angry sense of the word - hopping mad, in fact. His anger stems from the scrutiny that has been placed on his performances since the World Cup and, specifically, the barrage of criticism after his infamous air-shot in the 2-0 defeat in their qualifier in Croatia last October. Robinson has been hurt by what he perceives to be a media campaign to have him removed from the England team and yesterday, as the team arrived in Tel Aviv, he laid bare his grievances. &quot;It has been a learning curve because I have never had to suffer criticism at a personal level,&quot; he said. &quot;I have never been subjected to anything quite like this before.&quot; Robinson&apos;s argument is that he has been made a scapegoat for England&apos;s poor sequence of results. He was alarmed, in particular, by the reaction to Steve McClaren&apos;s decision to experiment with Ben Foster in last month&apos;s friendly against Spain. &quot;I totally knew why I was sitting out the Spain game but you guys - the television, the media, the newspapers - made it into something else,&quot; he said. &quot;I could understand the manager&apos;s point of view. Ben hasn&apos;t played a European game for his club, never mind an international game, so the manager needed to know he could cope in that situation. I fully understood but other things were made of it.&quot; He was referring to the events in Zagreb, when a divot took Gary Neville&apos;s back-pass beyond him for Croatia&apos;s second goal, and the perception in the media that McClaren was bringing in Foster because he had tired of Robinson&apos;s errors. It remains a sore subject and, when one reporter asked the Tottenham goalkeeper if he was over his mistake, it quickly became apparent he had chosen the wrong word. &quot;You have just used the word &apos;mistake&apos;,&quot; Robinson snapped. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a mistake. I went to kick the ball and it wasn&apos;t there. You look at it and tell me: what could I have done? It was a ridiculous bobble. For people to say it was an error, for you to say it was my fault, that&apos;s ridiculous. That angers me, to be honest. To get tarred with that brush of being &apos;error-prone&apos; is ridiculous.&quot; He did acknowledge, however, that his form had been erratic at times. &quot;I feel like I have picked up in the last few weeks or so,&quot; he said. &quot;I am getting back to the top of my game. Confidence helps.&quot; Had his confidence been affected? &quot;I have taken a lot of criticism since Croatia when still, to this day, I don&apos;t think there is anything I could have done. It does affect you because you find it&apos;s held against you. It takes a strong person to come through something like that and, at times, it has been difficult. &quot;It was on every single TV channel and in every newspaper. It kills you inside and it hurts your family to see you suffer. My wife and our little one have suffered as well. But I&apos;m a strong person. I&apos;ve had support from my family, my friends, other goalkeepers and people who understand football. It&apos;s gone now, finished with. I want to look to the future now.&quot; It is a future in which Foster has signalled his intentions to supplant him in the England team on a permanent basis. Scott Carson&apos;s form at Charlton Athletic has also impressed McClaren but Robinson is a firm believer in his own ability. &quot;Scott and Ben are at clubs who have been struggling in the league,&quot; he said. &quot;I get one save a game - they get six, seven or eight. They are getting rave reviews but they are getting seven or eight saves and I am getting only one. And if I don&apos;t get that one, it&apos;s immediately said that I have had a bad game. It&apos;s difficult. It is a job you want but it isn&apos;t easy when you get it. Everybody thinks when you are young and up and coming that you should have the job but, when you get it, everybody tries to shoot you down. That&apos;s part and parcel of it, I suppose.&quot; Robinson clearly feels hard done by and he has chosen his words carefully since scoring with a freakish free-kick past Foster at White Hart Lane last weekend. &quot;I have been on the end of criticism and it&apos;s not a nice place to be,&quot; he explained. &quot;I&apos;ve had first-hand experience of it and I wouldn&apos;t wish it on anybody. But I think it would have been exaggerated if it was the other way around.&quot; Talking about his goal at least lightened his mood. &quot;You couldn&apos;t have written a season like this one,&quot; he said. &quot;To suffer, to have what happened in Croatia, and then the total reversal of scoring a goal. Who could have written that?&quot; Rivals for No1 shirt  Ben Foster Age 23, caps 0 On loan to Watford from Manchester United for a second season, and his first in the Premiership, the 6ft 4in Foster, below, has excelled in a struggling side this season.

Zahavi, who tried to broker the infamous deal for Eriksson to quit England and take over at Chelsea, said the resentment towards Beckham was so extreme that it affected the players&apos; performances. The information, he said, had come from Eriksson and it will intensely embarrass not only the Swede but also Beckham at a time when there have been calls for him to be restored to the England squad. &quot;The problem in the World Cup was that the players gave only 30% of their ability,&quot; said Zahavi. &quot;That was because there was a big problem of jealousy inside the team. It&apos;s something that nobody else has talked about before but the fact is a lot of the players didn&apos;t like the status of David Beckham in the team. They were jealous of Beckham. They haven&apos;t talked about it but this was the thing that failed the team in Germany. &quot;That is probably why Steve McClaren decided to get rid of him from the squad when he took over.

Zahavi represents Rio Ferdinand and by openly talking of divisions in the England camp he inadvertently implicates the Manchester United defender. &quot;If Eriksson would ever tell the whole story, everyone would understand what was going on inside the England dressing room,&quot; said the agent. &quot;Today, under McClaren, all the players are equal before the coach and that makes it a much more convenient situation.&quot; Beckham&apos;s name remaining high on the agenda will annoy McClaren as he prepares for tomorrow&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier and he is unlikely to be pleased by Zahavi&apos;s prediction of what would happen if England lost. &quot;He knows if England stumbles in Israel it will be an earthquake in football,&quot; said Zahavi. &quot;If that happens they will drink his blood and finish him.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T01:30:35Z", "title": "'Jealousy' of Beckham caused World Cup flop", "sentences": ["Pini Zahavi usually goes by the title of super-agent but as England arrived in Tel Aviv last night Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s close friend and adviser had taken on the role of whistle-blower."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/23/newsstory.sport11"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Football", "UK news"], "article": "As a resident of Jerusalem, watching the build up ahead of the game with England tomorrow, it is clear that for Israel this is much more than just a football match. The event has the country in a frenzy of excitement, but why? Part of the reason is that Israelis love English football. Most Israeli football fans have a favourite Premiership team. There are at least as many English games available on TV here as in England and half the Israeli equivalent of the football pools involves predicting the results of English matches. Israeli affection for the English game gives an English visitor to Israel an instant rapport with any taxi driver. I must have had the following conversation a hundred times:  Israeli cab driver (incorrectly identifying my accent): Where you from? America?Me: No, Britain. Driver: Ah, from London! Me: No, from Manchester. Driver: Ah Manchester! Manchester United! That&apos;s the greatest team in the whole world, Ronaldo, what a player etc ...  This normally provides ample conversation for a twenty minute journey. One confused driver I met was convinced that Manchester United was a London-based club. I soon put him straight. So not only are Israelis hoping to see their team stay in with a chance of progressing to the finals, but they are thrilled at the chance to see their English heroes up-close. As a result, tickets for this game have been sold out for weeks, and many English immigrants bought season tickets months ago to be sure they wouldn&apos;t miss out. But there is more to this than mere sporting passions. There is a general sense of affection for the English. Jerusalem is full of reminders of the British mandate in Palestine, which lasted from the end of the First World War until Israel&apos;s founding in 1948. The imposing King George Street which runs through the heart of the city, is a firm reminder that Britain was once the ruling power in these parts. Prior to the end of the mandate in 1948, there were as many as 100,000 British troops based here. I recently discovered that at the end of my street there was once a polo pitch used by British officers. More historically-minded Israelis will remember the fraught relationship between the British authorities and the Jews of Palestine in the later years of the mandate, when Jewish refugees were barred from entering Palestine on the eve of the Holocaust, and Britain abstained from the 1947 UN vote on partition. But Anglo-Israeli relations have come a long way since then. Excluding oil, Israel is Britain&apos;s largest trading partner in the Middle East, and politically, Israelis recognise Britain as their best friend in Europe. Tony Blair&apos;s support for Israel during last summer&apos;s conflict with Hizbullah marked him out from many of his more sceptical European colleagues. Generally, Israel is aware that it has a PR problem, and the visit of the English is an opportunity for the country to present a side to itself beyond the controversies of conflict in the region, as a vibrant and ambitious society, keen to make friends and impress visitors. Tel Aviv municipality has teamed up with the British Embassy to throw a huge party for both sets of fans in a city centre park. Adverts for the event in the Israeli press show an enthusiastic appreciation for English culture, promising &apos;lots of beer&quot;. The event is also being used to publicise Israel&apos;s pluralism, with a &quot;Football 4 Peace&quot; tournament with Jewish and Arab children. Israel is welcoming a 100-strong mission from the Kick Racism out of Football campaign, including former Liverpool stars John Barnes and Ronny Rosenthal. Israeli officials pulled out all the stops to prevent a general strike on Wednesday from shutting Ben Gurion airport and preventing the English from arriving - something that would have created a PR disaster. But even more than a love for the English game, a general affection for the British, and an opportunity for good PR, the excitement is fuelled by something deep rooted in the Israeli psyche. The Zionist movement was driven by a desire among the Jewish people to be on an equal footing with other nations. Competing in international sporting events gives Jews the feeling that Israel, a country that had to be voted into existence by the UN, has made it - that its legitimacy is accepted. This is particularly important at a time when Israel faces so many political challenges, both internally and externally. The public mood in Israel since last summer&apos;s conflict with Hizbullah has been one of deep depression. Win, lose or draw, hosting the England team, and competing with them on equal terms, is an opportunity for Israelis to celebrate anew the creation and achievements of the Jewish state.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T15:30:00Z", "title": "Israel's football frenzy", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv municipality has teamed up with the British Embassy to throw a huge party for both sets of fans in a city centre park."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/23/asaresidentofjerusalem"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "David Beckham"], "article": "Sven-Goran Eriksson has denied &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot; telling friends that England&apos;s World Cup plans were wrecked because players were jealous of David Beckham.

If you look at it professionally, Beckham shouldn&apos;t have played at certain times. But Sven put him in anyway. Now, at least, all the players are equal under McClaren.&quot; Zahavi also claimed Eriksson knows he made a mistake in not picking another striker in his squad. He chose to take teenager Theo Walcott and did not have enough cover when Michael Owen was injured. &quot;England should have had one more forward at the World Cup because when Michael Owen got injured there was no one to replace him,&quot; he said. &quot;I think looking back Eriksson knows that was a mistake.&quot; Zahavi believes McClaren must drop Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard because they cannot play successfully in the same team. &quot;Lampard and Gerrard can&apos;t play together,&quot; he declared. &quot;It&apos;s a fact. Lampard can&apos;t shoot all the time in the national team like he does at Chelsea. Zahavi also claimed if England lose in Tel Aviv tomorrow. McClaren will be sacked. &quot;If England fail in Israel it will cause an earthquake in football,&quot; he said. &quot;People say McClaren will stay if England lose but, in my opinion, they will drink his blood. They&apos;ll finish him once and for all. For England and McClaren it is a case of &apos;to be or not to be&apos;.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T15:49:36Z", "title": "Football: Sven-Goran Eriksson rejects agent's claims that his relationship with David Beckham ruined England's World Cup bid", "sentences": ["Zahavi also claimed if England lose in Tel Aviv tomorrow."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/23/newsstory.sport17"}, {"tags": ["Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Preamble Hello and welcome to live coverage of the crucial Group B game between India and Sri Lanka in Trinidad. It seems weird talking about cricket when the mother of all clouds is hanging over this competition, but Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, is insistent that the World Cup will go on, so here we are. Back on the pitch, the situation is, crudely put, this: if India beat Sri Lanka, they will almost certainly qualify for the Super Eights; if India lose, they will almost certainly fail to qualify, although they could be rescued by an unlikely Bermuda victory over Bangladdesh on Sunday. David Hopps has written this morning about the financial implications of an Indian defeat, but I&apos;d be just as concerned about the early loss to the competition of the likes of Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Either way, it is one of the most important games in the history of Indian cricket. The early news is that Dravid has won the toss and chosen to field first, as seems to be the trend. And for the stattos among you, a little titbit: in eight of the previous nine matches between these sides, the team batting second has gone on to win. The teams India have replaced Anil Kumble with Harbhajan Singh, while the Sri Lankans have brought in Dilhara Fernando for the injured Farveez Maharoof. Sri Lanka WU Tharanga, ST Jayasuriya, KC Sangakkara (wkt), DPMD Jayawardene (capt), LPC Silva, TM Dilshan, M Muralitharan, WPUJC Vaas, RP Arnold, SL Malinga, CRD Fernando India R Dravid (capt), SR Tendulkar, SC Ganguly, AR Uthappa, V Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni (wkt), AB Agarkar, Z Khan, MM Patel, Harbhajan Singh  A hunch, for what it&apos;s worth I reckon India are going to win, with Rahul Dravid making a big score. He usually saves his best for the pressure situations, and it doesn&apos;t come much more tense than this. And don&apos;t forget there&apos;s another game going on today up in Jamaica, where West Indies and Ireland are playing off for top spot in Group A and the two points the winners will be able to take through to the Super Eights. That game starts at 2.30pm GMT and I&apos;ll keep you posted. Bad news for Ireland though: their captain and opening bowler Trent Johnston is out injured.  The clever/not-so-clever money has been placed by Barry Glendenning on Sanath Jayasuriya to top-score for Sri Lanka and Dravid to do the same for India. Since his wagers are a direct result of, er, my advice, I shall be keeping a not-disinterested eye on their progress. Apparently, there&apos;s a pint in it for me if one of the bets comes off. Nothing if not effusively generous, Barry. The pitch at the Queen&apos;s park Oval in Port-of-Spain tends to be a bit up-and-down, so the early overs will be interesting. Dravid obviously thinks there will be something in the wicket for his new-ball bowlers: their tussle with Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga could dictate the direction of the game. 1st over: Sri Lanka 10-0 (Tharanga 1, Jayasuriya 0) It&apos;s an all-cack-handed intro, with the left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan bowling to Sri Lanka&apos;s two leftie openers. His first ball is a leg-side wide, before the seriously talented Upul Tharanga square-drives the third legitimate delivery for a single. And then Khan&apos;s first ball to Jayasuriya is a leg-side wide too - that was a shocker. The next three balls produce seven leg-byes, and that was a desperately scrappy start by India. &quot;Sorry,&quot; apologises Paul Foy, who is obviously in trouble again. &quot;I have to say I disagree with you thinking that Dravid, Singh and Dhoni et al would be a loss to the competition. Surely no bigger bunch of arrogant prima donnas have pulled on an international shirt? At least until 6pm tomorrow, Tel Aviv.&quot; I like the punchline, but I can&apos;t help feeling the rest of the email was simply a precursor. Dravid, a prima donna?! 2nd over: Sri Lanka 11-0 (Tharanga 1, Jayasuriya 0) Ajit Agarkar takes up the new-ball attack, and he&apos;s convinced he has removed Jayasuriya lbw with an inswinger first ball. That was what they call pretty adjacent - it was probably hitting leg - but Daryl Harper is having none of it and Agarkar looks for a second as if he is about to burst into tears. The second ball brings a less plausible shout for leg-before and the third fizzes past the outside edge. Superb stuff from a bowler who can&apos;t always be trusted. Jayasuriya counters the swing by standing well outside his crease, and then collects a leg-bye as the keeper Dhoni lets the ball trickle feebly through his legs. But that was a cracking over by Agarkar - as testing as Khan&apos;s was anodyone. &quot;What&apos;s the betting that Gary Naylor gets the first email mention?&quot; says Jack Lee.  3rd over: Sri Lanka 15-0 (Tharanga 4, Jayasuriya 1) Khan finds some extravagant movement there, but Jayasuriya can finally break his duck with a thick edge to third man for a single. Tharanga works him off his pads for two with a late adjustment and then edges Khan just in front of second slip and away for one more. 4th over: Sri Lanka 17-0 (Tharanga 5, Jayasuriya 2) Agarkar squares up Tharanga, but the outside edge flies safely towards third man for another single. India need to strike twice in the first 12 overs or so to justify Dravid&apos;s decision to bowl first, and so far Agarkar looks the likelier wicket-taker. And it&apos;s not often I&apos;ve written that sentence before. Jayasuriya steals the quickest of off-side singles, but that was another probing Agarkar over. And it&apos;s not often I&apos;ve etc blah. 5th over: Sri Lanka 19-0 (Tharanga 6, Jayasuriya 3) Better stuff from Khan, who doesn&apos;t concede a single until Jayasuriya works his fourth ball to square-leg. He then beats Tharanga with a beauty that cuts back and defeats the inside edge. A single to third man completes a good over. &quot;Since the mother of all clouds is being covered elsewhere after Selvey&apos;s excellent piece, I&apos;d like to suggest that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the most over-rated cricketer at the World Cup,&quot; says the inevitable Gary Naylor. &quot;Is there another so convinced by his own publicity?&quot; Harsh. I&apos;d say he&apos;s reasonably humble, from what I know. Unless you have evidence to the contrary. And OBO writers know never to underestimate Gary Naylor. 6th over: Sri Lanka 32-0 (Tharanga 14, Jayasuriya 6) Jayasuriya whips Agarkar off his pads for three, and - good grief - the outfield is very slow. That should have been four. And that IS four, as Tharanga fishes at one outside off and runs it dangerously close to second slip. And then Tharanga produces the shot of the morning: an up-and-over cover-driven slap as Agarkar offers a bit of width. The bowler is reverting to type now: 13 off the over. Meanwhile, a lot of you are getting stuck in to the Indians for no apparent reason other than that you might be bored at work and are trying to start a ruck. Here&apos;s Tom Warren. &quot;Maybe Dravid is not a prima donna but I think Prince Ganguly has taken arrogance to a new awe-inspiring level which no other human is even capable of reaching!&quot;  WICKET! Jayasuriya c Agarkar b Zaheer Khan 6 (33-1) That was the end of a miserable innings by Jayasuriya, who might have fallen lbw earlier in the over. In the end, he slapped a wide one high in the air to wide third man and Agarkar made no mistake with the catch. That wicket was no less than India deserved. 8th over: Sri Lanka 36-1 (Tharanga 15, Jayawardene 0) India are up for this, and Agarkar is up for that: an lbw shout first ball against Mahela Jayawardene, but it was missing leg. Barry Glendenning has just returned to his desk to be told the horrible news that his money on Jayasuriya was wasted. He&apos;s just said something about me not being able to tip sh*t off a shovel, which is fair enough in the circumstances. If India can just out the extras, they could really squeeze the Sri Lankans: the tally is 15 so far. &quot;Surely the most overrated player in the World Cup is none other than Virender Sehwag, whose loss of form is only matched by his loss of hair and growth of stomach,&quot; says Dan Curtis. 9th over: Sri Lanka 38-1 (Tharanga 16, Jayawardene 0) Tharanga has looked positive so far, and pushes a firm single to mid-on, where Dravid dives as if his job&apos;s on the line. Which it is. Jayawardene is beaten twice outside off by Khan, who has finally found his groove. Shame it&apos;s taken him so long. And then he bowls an off-side wide. My coat. I&apos;ll get it. &quot;For all their megastar statuses, I have found most Indian cricket stars humble in public,&quot; says Meera Spitteler. &quot;They know how to manage their image. The moment you mention some Indian star, you get emails saying how either how rubbish, overrated, arrogant, unpleasant they are. Maybe your readers are really churlish.&quot; Maybe. It&apos;s certainly one of the great imponderables. 10th over: Sri Lanka 44-1 (Tharanga 21, Jayawardene 1) Munaf Patel enters the attack in place of Agarkar (4-1-16-0), but his first ball is thick-inside-edged to square-leg for a single by Tharanga. Jayawardene uses his feet two balls later but gets away with an uppish drive which drops just in front of Agarkar at mid-off. Opposite me, Scott Murray is fuming. &quot;He should have just run in a bit,&quot; he seethes, summing up in a moment why he was such a great loss to the world of international cricket coaching. And there&apos;s four very lucky runs to Tharanga, who hurls the bat outside off and watches heart in mouth as the ball flies just wide of second slip and away for four. Scott Murray might have got a hand on that. &quot;Might I suggest that one more convinced by his own publicity is OBO&apos;s very own Gary Naylor?&quot; says Ronan Hayes. 11th over: Sri Lanka 50-1 (Tharanga 21, Jayawardene 6) Jayawardene decides enough is enough and hares down the track to whack Khan over the covers for four. A wide and a quick single bring up the 50. &quot;I&apos;ll have you know,&quot; says Scott Murray, &quot;that I have a dab hand in the slips.&quot; Hoisting? Own? Petard? &quot;Gary Naylor is surely talking nonsense,&quot; says David Adams. &quot;Yes, Dhoni thinks he&apos;s better than he is, but his actual ability is still better than most. He averages over 45 in ODIs. Obviously nowhere near as good as Nixon, Geriant Jones, Chris Read, etc... and in fact Adam Gilchrist, who averages 37. Yes, he&apos;s over-rated.&quot; 12th over: Sri Lanka 52-1 (Tharanga 22, Jayawardene 7) A slight technical hitch hits GU Towers as Sky decide to cover Ireland v West Indies instead. Leaving me in a bit of a spot. Just two off that Patel over. Apparently. &quot;I find it incredible that a cricket obsessed country of over a billion people can&apos;t produce one bowler who can get up to the 90 mph mark,&quot; says Darren Downs. WICKET! Jayawardene c Dhoni b Agarkar 7 (53-2) And just as we switch TVs, Jayawardene is brilliantly held by Dhoni after leg-glancing Agarkar. India, dare I say it, are on top. 13th over: Sri Lanka 54-2 (Tharanga 23, Sangakkara 1) Ireland have won the toss in Jamaica and are batting first. Glendenning has just cheered their first run. And - my goodness me! - Kumar Sangakkara would have been run out for a duck if that shy from midwicket had hit. That was a crazy single. 14th over: Sri Lanka 58-2 (Tharanga 23, Sangakkara 5) A decent over from Patel as Sri Lanka attempt to consolidate following the slightly freakish demise of Jayawardene. At least it was a decent over until Sangakkara spanked the last ball through the covers for four. The shot of a man in the form of his life. &quot;What Darren Downes say is true,&quot; says Richard Knowles, &quot;but equally amazing is the fact that a cricket-obsessed country of over a billion people actually exists.&quot; 15th over: Sri Lanka 60-2 (Tharanga 24, Sangakkara 5) Over in Jamaica, the Ireland opener William Porterfield is out for a duck. Oh dear. Back in Trinidad/Farringdon, Tharanga has just slapped Agarkar for four. This is a crucial partnership: these two batsmen are in glorious form. &quot;Tipping sh*t off a shovel really isn&apos;t as easy as people might think,&quot; says Mahinda Kularatne. &quot;Trust me on this - I spent three months working on a sewage plant.&quot; 16th over: Sri Lanka 67-2 (Tharanga 31, Sangakkara 5) Patel&apos;s first ball after the drinks break is lashed over the covers for four by Tharanga, who plays that shot quite brilliantly. It&apos;s precisely the kind of stroke you could never imagine an England opener playing. Three balls later Tharanga eases Patel back down the ground for two: power followed by timing. Can Sri Lanka win the World Cup? They can, but my only worry is that they might have peaked too early. &quot;What is today?&quot; asks Sidd in India. &quot;International let&apos;s find faults day? Mr. Downs may be right, there might no be any &quot;express&quot; bowlers from India, but how many world-class batsman have we produced? I know an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, but I have to answer Mr. Downs in a language he can understand, let&apos;s combine the total runs scored by Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly and compare it with the total runs scored by the current English side, oh, is that a stark contrast I see? Guess I have to write the Post script in his language too, P.S: How many times have the English, inventors of cricket, have won the World Cup or Champions Trophy?&quot; Five. 17th over: Sri Lanka 70-2 (Tharanga 33, Sangakkara 6) The game is in the balance. If India can prise out two more wickets in the next five overs, they will fancy their chances. But another 75 runs from these two and Sri Lanka could be looking at 280. Oh, the joys of speculation. Agarkar continues and almost forces Tharanga to play on, but the inside edge results only in a single. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessarily that Dhoni is arrogant, more that any Indian player who hits a few sixes is immediately hyped by their fans as the next Viv Richards, despite clearly being a flat-track slogger in the Ballerina Afridi mode,&quot; says Peter Williams. &quot;Though I admit that the red mullet he sported for a while doesn&apos;t suggest the shy-and-retiring type.&quot; 18th over: Sri Lanka 71-2 (Tharanga 33, Sangakkara 6) Patel beats Tharanga outside off with one that bounces and seams away a fraction. In other words, it was unplayable. You sense that neither side quite knows how to take the initiative as Tharanga works Patel for a leg-bye off his hip. &quot;If Dan Curtis - Over 8 - has been &apos;rating&apos; Sehwag ahead of this World Cup, then may I ask if he has been living in a cave for the past 12 months?&quot; wonders Sriharsha Pappu. We have some strange readers, Sriharsha... 19th over: Sri Lanka 77-2 (Tharanga 34, Sangakkara 11) On comes Harbhajan Singh, who is in the team for Anil Kumble, apparently because Kumble goes for runs against the Sri Lankans. I&apos;d have them both in the side, but then what do I know? It should be an interesting battle, because his stock ball will go across the two left-handers, but his third delivery is tucked to midwicket for a single by Tharanga. Sangakkara then lives dangerously by lofting Harbhajan just over wide mid-on for four. That was close. A single completes the over. 20th over: Sri Lanka 78-2 (Tharanga 34, Sangakkara 12) Ireland have recovered well since losing Porterfield for a duck: they&apos;re 33 for 1 in the seventh over. Surely they can&apos;t win again, can they? Back in the real world, Patel is enticing all manner of rashness out of Sangakkara outside off, but he can&apos;t find the edge. A quick single off the last ball of the over prevents a maiden. &quot;At the risk of extending a slightly coprocentric thread and in the full knowledge that I can&apos;t claim the same expertise as Mahinda Kularatne, how hard can it really be to tip sh*t off a shovel?&quot; says Ben Mimmack. &quot;I can&apos;t really think of any complicating factors and I&apos;d be interested to hear more from him on the subject.&quot; 21st over: Sri Lanka 82-2 (Tharanga 35, Sangakkara 15) Harbhajan is furious to concede two to long-off as Sangakkara drives him to Sourav Ganguly. Linford Christie might have been hard pushed to keep that to a single, but Harbhajan is still fuming. And he&apos;s a world-class fumer. &quot;Just snuck off down the pub to watch the India Sri Lanka match, pint of Young&apos;s and pack of mini Cheddars at the ready, about to phone the boss and claim an overrunning dentist&apos;s appointment, when into the self-same pub walks aforementioned boss on the hunt for work-dodgers,&quot; says Ed Wilson. &quot;Bugger.&quot; 22nd over: Sri Lanka 88-2 (Tharanga 40, Sangakkara 15) Ganguly gets the chance to fiddle through a few of his waddling medium-pacers, but his first ball is cut hard for four by Tharanga, who looked very average in England last summer against Matthew Hoggard, but then upped his game spectacularly during Sri Lanka&apos;s one-day whitewash. Ireland are 40 for 1 after nine, which is more than respectable. &quot;This one billion Indian fans number keeps popping up and jars me,&quot; says Hari Shankar. &quot;Cricket is a game of the rich and India has 70% of the population Below Poverty Line. If we add the number of people who have Television, time, inclination and the madness to follow the media I would peg the fans number at 30 Million and not more than that. I request you to Stop this Billion fans mantra - at least in OBO!&quot; consider it stopped.  23rd over: Sri Lanka 91-2 (Tharanga 43, Sangakkara 15) Tharanga goes inside out to work Harbhajan to deep extra for two, then picks off a simple single. The game has gone quiet again, which will suit Sri Lanka more than it will India. They need to Make Things Happen. WICKET! Sangakkara c Patel b Ganguly 15 (92-3) That, I suppose, is how to make things happen. But Sangakkara will be mad with himself. He tried to loft Ganguly back over his head but didn&apos;t get hold of it properly and gave Patel the chance to run round from long-on and take a simple catch. A potentially crucial moment. &quot;Re: Darren Downs 12th Over,&quot; begins Matthew Franklin. &quot;Darren, my wife finds it incredible that a brain of over a billion cells still can&apos;t produce one thought above the sex, beer, food mark... what can I say, poo happens.&quot; There&apos;s a disturbingly scatological feeling to today&apos;s OBO, which has to stop. 24th over: Sri Lanka 93-3 (Tharanga 44, Silva 1) The new batsman is Chamara Silva as Ireland cruise to 51 for 1 off 11 overs against the Windies in Jamaica. Surely not etc. Silve gets going with a straightforward push for one to mid-off off Ganguly.  25th over: Sri Lanka 97-3 (Tharanga 46, Silva 3) Silva looks busy early on, taking another quick single, this time off Harbhajan, but the man the Indians want now is Tharanga, who has oscillated between danger and dash. I like the look of him. Dravid has a slip in for the new batsman, which suggests he scents blood, but then Harbhajan beats Tharanga with a ripper that turns and bounces. Four singles off the over as the innings reaches the halfway mark. 26th over: Sri Lanka 106-3 (Tharanga 52, Silva 6) There&apos;s Tharanga&apos;s fifty, courtesy of a thumping cut for four off Ganguly. It took him 69 balls and has held Sri Lanka&apos;s innings together. Ganguly might have taken a wicket in his last over, but Sri Lanka will reason they should be taking at least a run a ball off him. And in that over they managed nine. &quot;Salut Laurent,&quot; says Cecile Ithurbide, as I threaten to melt at my keyboard. &quot;How come there isn&apos;t a French cricket team in the World Cup? France does have a team, so why not include them? I mean, if Scotland is in...&quot; Sorry, Cecile. There&apos;s this pesky thing called qualification... 27th over: Sri Lanka 111-3 (Tharanga 56, Silva 7) Two more to Tharanga, who drives Patel through the off-side and is denied by the lesser-spotted Ganguly dive on the boundary. Wonders never cease. The game remains in the balance. &quot;At the rate Ireland&apos;s going I&apos;m going to start supporting them instead of England,&quot; says the fickle Amy Clements. &quot;Their top order certainly seems more stable. And I&apos;m sure I had a great-great-great Irish relative. Which probably makes me eligible to play for them on current team-choosing form...&quot;  28th over: Sri Lanka 116-3 (Tharanga 57, Silva 11) Ganguly continues and is unlucky to concede four as Silve thin-edges a booming drive and picks up a boundary as Zaheer Khan makes a meal of it on the third-man fence. Dravid does not look impressed, but he shouldn&apos;t be surprised: India&apos;s boundary fielding so often lets them down. &quot;Can I suggest to the work-shy slacker Ed Wilson (21st over) that picking the nearest boozer to the office on such an occasion is a basic schoolboy error,&quot; says Charles Walford, &quot;and he&apos;s more likely to get fired for sheer stupidity than any work-related reasons.&quot; 29th over: Sri Lanka 117-3 (Tharanga 58, Silva 11) Patel beats Silva with a beauty. He&apos;s the kind of bowler who comes to life when you least expect him to. And the bad news for fans of Ireland and sporting romance is that Eoin Morgan is out for 18 against West Indies: the Irish are 61 for 2. &quot;About the comment made by Hari Shankar: good point,&quot; says Aditya Anchuri. &quot;But don&apos;t sell your country short. The number of people living below the poverty line (by Indian standards) is around 50% now, because of the strides made in the last 10 years. Nevertheless, we are one of the fastest growing economies, so the future looks bright. But you&apos;re absolutely right about the 30 million fans thing. The full billion includes the too poor, the too old, the too young and the too busy. So the number is about 25 million I would say.&quot;  30th over: Sri Lanka 124-3 (Tharanga 59, Silva 16) Tharanga seems to have set himself to bat through the innings. If he does that, he will make a century, although it won&apos;t be a big one at this rate. Seven off Harbhajan&apos;s over. &quot;I&apos;ve just had people crowd round my desk and give me a birthday card,&quot; weeps Alex Warwick. &quot;Now I have to bring in cakes on Monday. Being a miserable bugger how do I get out of this?&quot; 31st over: Sri Lanka 128-3 (Tharanga 60, Silva 17) The second drinks break is followed by Sachin Tendulkar and his licorice allsorts. He seems to be bowling little awayswingers here and they&apos;re tidy enough without being especially threatening. Having said that, he does beat Silva outside off, but it was a - rather harsh - no-ball. &quot;I once saw Shovel from early-nineties dance disasters M People having an almighty struggle to wipe some bird sh*t off his lapel after a pigeon dropped its load on him outside a bar in Leicester Square,&quot; reveals Rob Phillipson. &quot;I think he was the drummer.&quot; 32nd over: Sri Lanka 133-3 (Tharanga 64, Silva 18) This game is boiling under nicely as Harbhajan continues. Just five off his over and Sri Lanka should be aiming for 250 at least. &quot;Dhoni is over-hyped by Indian cricket fans but we do know our cricket,&quot; says Rajkumar Jakkaraju. &quot;And we know that he is no Viv Richards and neither was Tendulkar even in his prime!&quot; QED. WICKET! Tharanga lbw b Tendulkar 64 (133-4) Well, well. First Ganguly, now Tendulkar. Tharanga went back to try to work him to leg, but missed and was hit in front of leg-stump. But did he get an inside edge? I&apos;d need to see another replay to make up my mind. Whatever, that&apos;s a huge wicket: Tharanga was Sri Lanka&apos;s glue and India have the edge. Just.  33rd over: Sri Lanka 137-4 (Silva 20, Dilshan 2) Tendulkar is making the ball swing away from the right-handers here. Still not sure about the dismissal. Tillekeratne Dilshan is the new batsman as Ireland reach 75 for 2 off 20 overs.  34th over: Sri Lanka 144-4 (Silva 24, Dilshan 4) Oh dear. Niall O&apos;Brien, slayer of the Pakistanis, is out for 11 in Jamaica and the Irish are suddenly tottering. But I digress. And there&apos;s three to Silva, who rocks back to cut Harbhajan into the wide open spaces of the off-side. &quot;An idea for Alex Warwick (over 30),&quot; says Peter Liljenberg. &quot;Call in sick on Monday, claiming a late bout of winter vomiting disease. The co-workers shouldn&apos;t be too keen for you to bring them cake then.&quot; 35th over: Sri Lanka 147-4 (Silva 25, Dilshan 6) Who will crack first? Tendulkar is asking questions of the Sri Lankans, who are mixing certain pushes for one with panicky sweeps. It&apos;s all strangely engrossing. &quot;I had a similar situation with my birthday but got out of it just by refusing to buy cakes or any other similar snack,&quot; explains Duncan Haskell. &quot;Never again have I been asked to bring in festive foods and I&apos;ve managed to get myself excluded from the hilarious forwards my colleagues used to send me as well. My time can now be fully dedicated to OBO.&quot; And we&apos;re happy to have you on board, Duncan, you barrel of laughs, you. 36th over: Sri Lanka 157-4 (Silva 29, Dilshan 11) Ireland are falling to pieces: they&apos;re now 82 for 4. Just as crucially, the man out is Jeremy Bray, who hit a hundred against Zimbabwe. Oh, and there&apos;s four more to Dilshan, who cuts the returning Khan with a flourish. But Silva&apos;s boundary is far flukier: a big inside edge to fine leg as he played forward. Well bowled. Luckily batted. &quot;The only way I can see for Alex Warwick to get out of buying cakes is for him to get fired before Monday,&quot; says the ridiculously named Alex Ferguson. &quot;Alex - there&apos;s still time for you to publically make a pass at your boss.&quot; 37th over: Sri Lanka 161-4 (Silva 30, Dilshan 14) How close can Sri Lanka get to 250? It might depend how many wickets they have in hand at the start of the last five overs. Tendulkar has bowled pretty well here, and snakes another 68mph awayswinger past Dilshan&apos;s grasping outside edge. It&apos;s funny how the least obviously threatening bowlers can sometimes cause the most panic. Just four off a very good over. &quot;I&apos;m in complete sympathy with Alex Warwick,&quot; says Andrew Kelly. &quot;At our office, we also are obliged to bring in cakes when it is our birthday. I mean, what the hell? Why should the birthday boy or girl be forced to fork out for some ready made Morrison&apos;s stale sponge cake?&quot; 38th over: Sri Lanka 170-4 (Silva 37, Dilshan 16) How much bad luck can one man endure? Silva produces a carbon copy of his inside edge for four in the last over off Khan, who smiles philosophically. Dilshan cuts hard for a single, and this has been a very useful stand so far: 133 for 4 could easily have become 145 for 6. Or am I speaking from the perspective of an England follower? &quot;Alex, tell them you&apos;re Peter Pan and you don&apos;t have birthdays and it never was your birthday anyway but you&apos;ll take the presents and the drinks down the pub later anyway,&quot; suggests Mitesh Khatri, not very helpfully. They&apos;ll never fall for it. 39th over: Sri Lanka 173-4 (Silva 39, Dilshan 17) Silva has ridden his luck, but, heck, he&apos;s still there and Sri Lanka will be very grateful for that. A total of 250 becomes more likely by the over. Just three singles off another fiddly Tendulkar over.  40th over: Sri Lanka 179-4 (Silva 41, Dilshan 21) India won&apos;t want to chase much more than 250, given that most of the pitches in this competition have got slower as they have gone along and Sri Lanka have a bowler called Muttiah Muralitharan. Good running from Dilshan, who works Harbhajan to leg and scampers two. Six off the over. &quot;What is this anti-cake nonsense?&quot; says Carol Fullilove. &quot;In my team the purchasing of cakes is a solemn and sacred duty. Given that Konditor and Cook is just round the corner it&apos;s also a bit bleedin&apos; expensive, but a source of great joy nonetheless (have you TRIED their chocolate fudge cake? Dreamy!).&quot; 41st over: Sri Lanka 184-4 (Silva 45, Dilshan 22) At last, Tendulkar&apos;s shackles are loosened as Silva uses his feet to lift him over midwicket for four. Tendulkar, incidentally, is now bowling inswingers to complement the earlier outswingers. Multi-talented, eh? &quot;Would Peter Pan get served in a pub?&quot; wonders David Ellis. &quot;Surely he wouldn&apos;t have the necessary ID what without a date of birth and all.&quot; 42nd over: Sri Lanka 187-4 (Silva 46, Dilshan 24) These two are scoring at a run a ball, but Sri Lanka need them to make it eight or nine an over from hereon in. Harbhajan stubbornly refuses to make life easy for them, though. Just three singles off a parsimonious over. &quot;My wife makes me cakes to take in for my colleagues, and very nice they are too,&quot; says Anton Lawrence. &quot;Maybe Alex Warwick should just get married?&quot; 43rd over: Sri Lanka 193-4 (Silva 49, Dilshan 27) Like Khan and to a lesser extent Harbhajan, Tendulkar hasn&apos;t had much luck with the ball either today as another uppish drive flies safely towards third man. Sri Lanka collected six singles off that over: high-class milking. &quot;Alex, I suggest that you promise them a cake is in the mail and they will forget eventually,&quot; says Gauri Mohan. &quot;Isn&apos;t that what The Fiver does with its letter-of-the-day-prizes?&quot; Couldn&apos;t possibly comment. 44th over: Sri Lanka 201-4 (Silva 54, Dilshan 29) Silva reaches his second fifty of the competition from only 60 balls. He&apos;s had moments of fortune, but - hey - don&apos;t we all! Dilshan picks up two streaky runs with a drive through the vacant slip for two off Harbhajan, then misses a reverse-sweep which umpire Harper signals as a wide. Harbhajan finishes with 10-0-53-0. Very average. &quot;Do you think the Queen would have to bring in cakes twice a year if she worked in an office?&quot; asks Tom Hodgson. 45th over: Sri Lanka 212-4 (Silva 59, Dilshan 34) Dilshan opens his shoulders to mow Tendulkar over midwicket for four. Shot! This has been a really enterprising partnership between these two. And a potential matchwinner. And there&apos;s four more, this time thanks to a Silva sweep. Suddenly Tendulkar&apos;s figures look distinctly mediocre. &quot;It could be worse,&quot; says peregrine Roscorla. &quot;I bought in cakes for my birthday and then everyone forgot to buy me a card. I now get called a cheap skate whenever I am asked to contribute towards someone else card or present and refuse citing my lack of a card earlier in the year.&quot; WICKET! Dilshan c Dhoni b Patel 38 (216-5) At last a wicket! Dilshan advances on Patel, but his big drive turns into a thin nick to Dhoni. India are relieved. And if they can limit the Lankans to under 250, they might be positively ecstatic. 46th over: Sri Lanka 216-5 (Silva 59, Arnold 0) Ireland are 115 for 4 after 32 overs. So they&apos;re not finished yet. An excellent over from Patel: four runs, one wicket. Outstanding at this stage of the innings. WICKET! Silva c Dhoni b Zaheer Khan 59 (216-6) One brings two and this time it&apos;s Silva&apos;s turn to get a thin edge on the drive as Zaheer angled one across him. Sri Lanka could yet make a mess of this. I don&apos;t think 235 will be enough. 47th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (Arnold 1, Vaas 5) Chaminda Vaas might have gone first ball but his thin edge flies just wide of Dhoni and away for four. These are crucial moments, but India&apos;s bowlers have stuck to their task impressively. 48th over: Sri Lanka 238-6 (Arnold 10, Vaas 12) Russel Arnold hammers Patel through the covers, where an old-looking Dravid dives over the ball and doesn&apos;t get up. A touch of cramp, I think. He&apos;ll be just fine, and so might Ireland: 128 for 4 after 35 against West Indies. Sri Lanka need 250 and they&apos;re helped in their quest by a thumping straight-drive for six by Vaas, who is - as they say - no mug. And Arnold finishes the a superb over for the Lankans with a cover-drive for four. &quot;I work with Duncan Haskell,&quot; says Andrew Kelly, &quot;and let me tell you, if there&apos;s one work-dodging, no-cake-sharing, granny mugger you want to avoid being on board the SS OBO, it&apos;s him.&quot;  49th over: Sri Lanka 244-6 (Arnold 14, Vaas 14) For those of you with nothing better to do, I&apos;ll be covering the Indian reply as and when it gets going. And it could turn into a cracker. Just six off that over. But Sri Lanka are in sight of the semi-promised land of 250.  50th over: Sri Lanka 254-6 (Arnold 19, Vaas 19) Agarkar bowls the last over of the innings, but his first ball is a filthy leg-stump half-volley which Arnold helps past short fine leg for four. A sickener for India. The next two balls produce only an Arnold single, but then Vaas turns an attempted yorker into a full-toss and cracks it over midwicket for four. Ten off the over, and it&apos;s pretty well even Stevens at the halfway stage. Join me in 45 minutes&apos; time to see if India can chase down the runs and stay in the World Cup.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T17:26:45Z", "title": "Sri Lanka innings", "sentences": ["At least until 6pm tomorrow, Tel Aviv.&quot; I like the punchline, but I can&apos;t help feeling the rest of the email was simply a precursor."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/23/cricket.lawrencebooth"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "The players look deflated, as well they might. Lena Gomez probably sums up things best with a pithy &quot;this was a truly awful game.&quot; What chance McClaren&apos;s boys can beat Andorra in Barcelona on Wednesday night? I don&apos;t know about you but I&apos;m not feeling confident. Thanks a lot for all your emails. Maybe if we all pile rpund to Gary Ford&apos;s he&apos;ll give us a consolatory beer or two. See you there. That&apos;s full time. England really faded away in the second half, though Defoe looked bright when he came on, creating more chances than Johnson did in the whole game. Min 92: England fluff a last-gasp corner as Rooney slips over. Benayoun then threatens to break through on the break. He&apos;s been disappointing. At the other end, Defoe is just offside as Gerrard whips a ball in. Min 90: The game is really petering out now in an almost silent stadium. Jem Bendell&apos;s analysis reads: &quot;Its not so much &apos;who to bring on to make a difference&apos;, but who to bring on to get the best out of the rest. It was clear from before the start that we wouldn&apos;t flow down the left. With Barry and Dyer on the left we would have had more natural left sided play, and Lennon could have unleashed havoc on the right. It required Gerrard being inside, and Lampard on the bench. But that would require two things McClaren doesnt know the meaning of: insight and risk. No wonder then he spent millions on proven mid rated players at Middlesborough.&quot; Then again, if England had nicked a goal, as they could have done, we&apos;d all be saying it was an excellent, contolled and patient performance. Min 88: Defoe plays Richards in. The right-back scores but he was clearly offside and the goal is disallowed. Alix Sharkey speaks for a lot of people when he says: &quot;Is it unpatriotic of me, being English, to say I hope Israel win this game so we can get rid of Second Choice Steve asap? Or should I be rooting for this bunch of donkeys and their asinine coach?&quot; Min 86: Lampard&apos;s legs crumple under him as Gerrard plays the ball into him at the edge of the box. No one touched him. If that was Cristiano Ronaldo, David Platt wouldn&apos;t be letting him off with a bland &quot;he was just anticipating the challenge.&quot; Min 84: Defoe cleverly makes space for himself from Rooney&apos;s knockdown but his point-blank shot is straight at the keeper. Then Hargreaves hits a poor shot into the ground and straight at the keeper. Ho hum. Min 82: Rui Saraiva says: &quot;Re: the &apos;Lampard is fat&apos; conceit: I have also had plenty of mirth with the &quot;Fat Frank&quot; jibes ever since the World Cup, but surely I can&apos;t be the only one to have felt slightly silly after the man took his shirt off at the end of the Tottenham game. Fat Frank, really? Really? Also, if I understood Andrew Ferguson&apos;s etymology lesson correctly: there are five orphans in the Israeli team?&quot; Steve McClaren must certainly be questioning their parentage at this stage. How is he going to explain this one? Especially as he has just brought on Downing for the admittedly fading Lennon. Min 78: Gerrard thrusts forward but his attempted one-two with the disappointing Rooney is intercepted. Defoe is on for the equally disappointing Johnson. Min 75: Just a quarter of an hour left for England to score. Micah Richards is on for Neville while for Israel Bodarov replaces Tamuz. Defoe is warming up. Platt thinks he might &quot;sniff England a goal out of nothing&quot;. An interesting idea, but it&apos;s Crouch&apos;s nose we really need, I suspect. Shame it&apos;s broken. Min 72: Gerrard feeds Neville in the box but his cross is cut out for a corner, which comes to nothing. And things are under way again in Norway, where Matthew McGregor informs us Bosnia have just scored. &quot;You wont believe it, but it was a corking free kick,&quot; he says. &quot;We are now waiting to see what the fans do. Presumably the Bosnians will unfurl a banner apologising.&quot; Perhaps. Their hearts must be ablaze with regret. Min 70:Shahar has replaced Balili for Israel. Russia are leading against Estonia, which isn&apos;t such good news for England. Min 65: Gerrard&apos;s wicked cross is onto Johnson&apos;s head in the six-yard box but a poor header goes wide. He should really have done much better there, but England are going closer and closer. As I type, Carragher&apos;s header from a corner hits the crossbar - though the keeper had it covered. Min 64: Some whistles from the crowd as England pass the ball around their own defence. But then Lennon puts in a decent cross but Lampard&apos;s glancing header is too fine and goes wide. Macedonia are leading in Croatia, though, apparently, so a draw might not be a disaster. Gary Naylor is back and this time it&apos;s GU he has it in for. &quot;GU are riding the wave of new media! Whilst an international incident erupts at Norway vs Bosnia, GU covers the tedium that is McClaren&apos;s England. Meanwhile South Africa are demolishing Australia at the Cricket World Cup, whilst GU covers the tedium that is Duncan Fletcher&apos;s England.&quot; Min 62: Lampard&apos;s shot is spilled by the keeper, who grabs it before Rooney can capitalise. Ronney then picks an argument with old friend Ben Haim, resulting in both having their names recorded by the referee. Min 58: Still little to report, with England not looking capable of finding a way through the Israeli defence. David Platt is getting restless but who is there realistically to bring on who can make a difference? David Clayton&apos;s brain has already drifted light years off. &quot;Ryker is being acused of molesting an alien&apos;s wife in Star Trek but may be cleared by a hologram recording. Can you wind on the Israel-England mess until 89 mins or get Rooney to molest the ref?&quot; he asks. Min 54: In a rare Israeli break, Balili turns and shoots in the box but it goes wide. The chance arose from a poor clearance from Hargreaves. Andrew Ferguson says: &quot;Re: Mr. Naylor&apos;s comment: As &quot;Ben&quot; in an Israeli&apos;s name means &quot;son of&quot;, a preponderance of B&apos;s in the Israeli lineup is about as much a surprise as an Icelandic team full of -sons, -ssons, and -sens. However, any pretence to mock Lampard is fine with me, especially after his wasting of the best chance of the first half after forgetting he had a left foot to shoot with.&quot; To be pedantic, I don&apos;t think there was any pretence about it. Min 51: England continue to probe but first Johnson and then Gerrard are dealt with well by the Israeli defence. Min 49: In the absence of any meaningful action on the field. lets have more on Norway from Matthew McGregor: &quot;The Bosnians are apparently pissed off at some corruption in the Bosnian FA. Ten of the top bosnian players have boycotted the game. The police have just said that the sensible Bosnian fans are leaving while the hard core are still kicking off, now smashing the chairs. According to my norwegian friends, the riot police here are as good as the Swiss navy so it doesnt look like the Bosnians have much to fear.&quot; They&apos;ve seen it all, those boys. Min 47:No change in the teams at half-time. No obvious change in the tactics either, with the Israeli defence force massing behind the ball once more. Adam says: &quot;You have to quit talking about the crappy Asian feeds. If anyone finds out about these they&apos;re going to charge us $25 for this shit, too.&quot; More to the point, no-one will read Guardian minute-by-minutes anymore. I hope the bosses aren&apos;t reading... Half-time musings: Andy in Fife confirms that Norway&apos;s game has been called of because of a fire, apparently caused by a firework thrown from the stand. Cue predicable comments about England needing a few fireworks in this second half. Paul (not yours truly) says: &quot;I think the Blackburn - Arsenal game was more exciting than this.&quot; A bit harsh but we could certainly do with someone scoring the really (ahem) set the game alight. You read it here first department: Eduardinho reliably informs me that &quot;Bosnian fans are setting fire to Ullev\u00e5l Stadium in Norway 1.5 minutes into the match.&quot; How he know this is anyone&apos;s guess. You don&apos;t happen to know who murdered Bob Woolmer as well, do you, Eduardinho? Half time is upon us and, for all their position, England haven&apos;t really created one really clear-cut chance with Israel defending in numbers. Johnson has been particularly quiet with no space to run into. I never thought I&apos;d say it but I wish Crouch was around. Min 44: Another warning for England as Spungin is left unmarked in the box. Luckily the ball is was poor. Jon in Minneapolis says: &quot;I&apos;m currently having the disorienting experience of watching England/Israel in Mandarin on my laptop in the midwestern USA. Tell Gary in Charlotte that he can watch the second half (although it really isn&apos;t worth his while) via dodgy chinese internet connection - all he has to do is download &quot;PPMate and/or TVants&quot; if he&apos;s got access to wireless.&quot; So that&apos;s that one sorted then. Now how about an English goal to show for their dominance? Min 41: Israel are sitting back and letting England come onto them. Lennon is seeing a lot of the ball but his left-foot crosses remain unsurprisingly disappointing. Min 39: A good tackle from Terry in the English box prevents Tamuz from getting a shot in. Gary Naylor is on good form tonight. &quot;Israel have a remarkable six &quot;B&quot;s in their starting line-up. England have just the one &quot;B&quot; - Lampard,&quot; he sniggers. Min 37: A good run by, of all people, Carragher results in a corner. The same player&apos;s header from that corner is straight at the goalkeeper. Chris in Helsinki says: &quot;Tell Gary Ford that he may be able to pay a few dollars to watch the match live via UEFA.com. Well unless, like me, he&apos;s on a Mac. They don&apos;t mention that in those bloody adverts with Mitchell and Webb, do they now?&quot; I wouldn&apos;t know. Min 32: A right-footed cross from Lennon is headed away, but it falls for Gerrard on the edge of the box. His trademark drive is well blocked by Ben Haim. Min 30: Rooney shows his petulance when, after being tackled by Badir, he bombs after him and barrels him down from behind with that redoubtable bulldog chest. Min 28: Sushan&apos;s cross from the right is right onto Tamuz&apos;s head but his effort is poor, missing the post by a good few yards. It&apos;s the proverbial warning for England. Min 26: It&apos;s all England at the moment. Lampard&apos;s ball in for Gerrard is a good one, and the keeper grabs the ball off Johnson&apos;s toe. But then the Brazilian Tamuz almost does a Lampard at the other end with a deflected shot which Robinson clings onto. Min 24: Lampard&apos;s deep free kick is met in the box by Carragher but his header is high and wide. Fernando asks: &quot;if Frankie Lampard scores what are the chances the press call for him to be benched anyway because he relies too much on deflections?&quot; Extremely high, I&apos;d say. And the press knows best. Min 21: DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET: Gerrard and Lampard link up excellently and only a smart save from Awat at Lampard&apos;s feet prevents England from taking the lead. Gary Ford is having a hard time of it in the US of A. &quot;Can anyone of your readers explain how Setanta make money by not actually showing this game on tv anywhere between Washington and Atlanta?&quot; he pleads &quot;We&apos;re stuck watching Estonia play Russia and getting a few seconds of the England game every minute or so off a dodgy internet feed from China. Also, if anyone actually has the game on in the Charlotte area, we&apos;ll be glad to bring beer.&quot; It&apos;s not worth a six-pack at the moment, to be honest, though England do have most of the possession. Min 17:  A better cross from Lennon falls onto Rooney&apos;s ample forehead, but the header is weak and Awat saves easily. Min 15:  Benado, who has already been booked, blatantly obstructs Lennon as he tries to break free. The referee is having none of it though. Min 12:  Carragher gets a yellow card for bringing down Balili in a promising Israeli break. David Platt is happy to take the card in the circumstances, and who am I to argue? Min 8:  The limits of McClaren&apos;s formation is revealed early as a promising burst of pace from Lennon ends in a lousy cross curling into the stand off his left peg. Min 6: England win a free-kick on the right but John Terry can&apos;t make it count. Linda Grant asks: &quot;So are you actually in Tel Aviv or hunched over the tv in Farringdon Road?&quot; Well, I could have gone to Tel Aviv but I though I couldn&apos;t justify the carbon given all the hot air already generated by this match. So I settled for the Guardian&apos;s ivory tower instead. It&apos;s better on the telly anyway. Min 4: Benayoun is already looking lively. After a mistake by Johnson he came close to dancing through a shaky-looking English defence. Min 2:  The first half-chance of the game goes to Tamuz after a mistake by Phil Neville. It was blazed well wide though. As for England, the onus, as usual, will be on Lampard and Gerrard to forget their egos and bring their club influence into the game. Sheridan Bird suggests they &quot;are a reverse Milli Vanilli - all the talent, all the natural ability but no records or glittering prizes. Not strickly true, of course, but we know what he&apos;s getting at. This will be a big night for Yossi Benayoun. After an excellent season last year he&apos;s succumbed to the general malaise at West Ham, despite insisting he is still their best player. Will the change of scene and circumstances bring the best out of him? First impressions are that Tel Aviv is not quite the den of intimidation we were led to believe. There are quite a few worried Israeli faces in the crowd. Having said that, there are a few worried English faces in the players&apos; tunnel too. The Israel team is Awat, Spungin, Ben Haim, Gershan, Ziv, Benayoun, Benado, Badir, Ben Sushan, Balili and Tamuz. The game is predicted to be a tough test for England, with Israel extremely strong in their home environment. On the other hand, Croatia beat them in a seven-goal thriller and according to that renowned sage Dean Saunders on the radio last night, no British team has lost in Israel in their last 14 visits. Trust that stat if you dare. Niall Glynn has already taken his eye off the ball with metrosexual musings on fashion. &quot;I&apos;ve seen Redknapp at least 20 times over the last year,&quot; he observes. &quot;On at least 18 of those occasions he&apos;s been wearing the same black tie. Surely being married to a Clothes Show presenter would suggest his collection would extend further.&quot; Perhaps he&apos;s in mourning for England&apos;s recent performances. Preamble: No Rob Smyth, I&apos;m afraid, so it&apos;s your caring, sharing night editor instead. But look at it this way: I can&apos;t be any less qualified to do a minute-by-minute than Steve McClaren is to manage England. On the subject of which, our Steve has picked two right-footers to play on England&apos;s left: Carragher at left-back and Aaron Lennon on the left wing. The full team is: Robinson, Carragher, Terry, Ferdinand, Phil Neville, Lennon, Gerrard, Lampard, Hargreaves, Johnson and Rooney.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T20:06:16Z", "title": "Football: Israel v England LIVE!", "sentences": ["Linda Grant asks: &quot;So are you actually in Tel Aviv or hunched over the tv in Farringdon Road?&quot; Well, I could have gone to Tel Aviv but I though I couldn&apos;t justify the carbon given all the hot air already generated by this match.", "First impressions are that Tel Aviv is not quite the den of intimidation we were led to believe."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/24/minutebyminute.sport"}, {"tags": ["Sport"], "article": "England managers are normally allowed one banana skin. Anything beyond that and the critics have them slithering towards inevitable failure while rounding up the usual suspects as possible successors. Those taking the job must know by now that they will probably end up among the turnips. Certainly Steve McClaren has made early strides in the fruit and veg business. He has been in charge of the England squad for the best part of a season but has yet to demonstrate that he is not, as some suspected even before his appointment, merely an average manager who produces average teams. A big win against Israel in Tel Aviv tonight and a big performance to go with it would alleviate the doubts without banishing them. At least it would prove McClaren capable, with Terry Venables&apos;s assistance, of improvising a victory in unpromising circumstances. And success in international football is often all about improvisation. A defeat would make it that much harder for England to reach next summer&apos;s European Championship, although with four of their last five qualifiers at home their quest would be far from over. Any satisfaction taken from a draw would depend on the results from today&apos;s other group games, yet from a personal point of view nothing but victory will ease the pressure on McClaren, which has been mounting ever since a wan goalless draw with Macedonia at Old Trafford was followed four days later by a limp 2-0 defeat against Croatia in Zagreb. If it is of any comfort to the England coach, most of his predecessors have experienced equally blue periods even if few of them have started amid such modest expectations. Alf Ramsey began with a 5-2 defeat in France in 1963 which finished England&apos;s interest in the European Nations Cup but the beginning of the end came 10 years later when he lost a World Cup qualifier 2-0 to Poland in Chorzow. At the first sign of a banana skin Don Revie walked out. Ron Greenwood&apos;s squad talked him out of resigning after England&apos;s chances of qualifying for the 1982 World Cup had been threatened by a 2-1 defeat in Switzerland but the same result in Norway had the back pages in an uproar before his team eventually reached Spain helped by the Swiss taking points off Romania. In the 1988 European Championship in West Germany Bobby Robson&apos;s side slid from one embarrassment to another but in Italia 90 he took England to the last four. The turnip jibe was born after Graham Taylor&apos;s team had gone out of the 1992 European Championship to Sweden - Swedes beat Turnips, geddit ? - although another World Cup defeat in Norway did more to bring him to the point of departure. Glenn Hoddle, with his faith healer, his karma and his diary, has been the only England manager so far to supply his own bananas. Kevin Keegan quit while he was behind and Sven-Goran Eriksson saved his worst till last. The main criticism of McClaren is that he selects ill-balanced teams and employs them in unsuitable formations. Injuries and the odd suspension have left him with a thin hand to play this time and claiming that he has players of the quality of Cristiano Ronaldo cannot hide the fact that Andy Johnson and Aaron Lennon are international novices. Systems are less important than the roles and attitudes of individual players. Picking Jamie Carragher at left-back would ask the Liverpool defender to play in the weakest of his recognised positions but there is no doubting that Carragher would give it his best shot. The return of Owen Hargreaves as a midfield anchor, on the other hand, would leave Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard with less excuse for failing to produce their club form at international level. So far Lampard, a galloping major for Chelsea, has been a galumphing minor for England. Defeat by Israel is unlikely but not unthinkable, for the Israelis have long possessed a capacity for producing the unexpected. Way back in the 1970 World Cup they held Sweden and Italy to draws and their captain, Mordechai Spiegler, so impressed Greenwood that he wanted to sign him for West Ham. The Football League, however, refused to lift the ban on foreign players. Now a West Ham Israeli, Yossi Benayoun, could, if fit, be England&apos;s nemesis. More recently Israel hastened France&apos;s failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup when they scored twice in the last five minutes to win 3-2 in Paris. Already in the Euro 2008 qualifiers they have held Russia in Moscow. Robson&apos;s side won a friendly in Tel Aviv 2-1 and later shared a scoreless draw there; a repeat of either result would suit England now - always assuming that they win in Andorra on Wednesday.

That, amid a sea of the usual platitudes about this being the time for England&apos;s players to stand up and deliver, was the message from John Terry last night. He and his colleagues, he said, had simply not been harsh enough in their dealings with one another. &quot;That&apos;s come up in one of our team meetings,&quot; the England captain said. &quot;At club level, where you&apos;re with everyone week in and week out, you can eff and blind and afterwards it&apos;s sorted out. I think we need that at this level as well. We need to do a lot more shouting at each other. &quot;I&apos;ve been given the armband for certain reasons, and I&apos;d like to think that&apos;s one of them. But I&apos;ve got to get other people around me screaming and shouting, too. Communication can be very key. We all need to do that.&quot; Terry was absent from England&apos;s last disappointment, the 1-0 defeat by Spain in a friendly at Old Trafford, but has sharp memories of the two draws against Macedonia and Holland and the defeat by Croatia that preceded it. Together, those poor results dispelled the premature euphoria created by the three victories which ushered in Steve McClaren&apos;s reign as head coach. &quot;If you don&apos;t get the right result,&quot; Terry continued, &quot;it eats away. You go home and watch the game over and over again and try to work out why the fans are frustrated, and everyone else. It&apos;s particularly frustrating when you lose with England. You want to get back together quickly, knowing that you&apos;ve not been at your best, and get out there and show that. It can&apos;t come round quick enough.&quot; But even the ordeal of watching their recent matches over and over again does not seem to have revealed the root causes of England&apos;s recent failures. And therein, perhaps, lies a clue to the team&apos;s inability to improve since the results started to deteriorate under McClaren. &quot;I&apos;m not too sure,&quot; Terry said, with an air of genuine puzzlement when asked if he knew what had gone wrong. &quot;There&apos;s not one thing I can put my finger on and say &apos;it&apos;s that&apos; and all the problems are sorted from there. For me it&apos;s a case of looking at the Croatia game and taking responsibility. As a group we need to show we&apos;re the players who do it in the Premiership week in and week out, and in Europe as well.&quot; On that traumatic night in Zagreb last October the team&apos;s effort was undermined by an experiment with 3-5-2 so disastrous that it is unlikely to be repeated under the present regime. Terry was happy to confirm that tonight&apos;s team will take the field in a more familiar formation. &quot;It was the first time that we&apos;ve done that an international level. I think we all know it hasn&apos;t worked,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But we&apos;re back to our 4-4-2 and I think that&apos;s probably our preferred formation. Everyone knows their role, their jobs, their duties.&quot; And among the keys to success should be the return of Owen Hargreaves, once abused and reviled by England&apos;s supporters but, since his performances in the role of defensive midfield player at last summer&apos;s World Cup, such a vital figure in the composition of the team that his absence from England&apos;s last four matches was reflected in the team&apos;s overall performance. &quot;It&apos;s very important to have him back in the squad,&quot; Terry confirmed. &quot;Obviously when he&apos;s been out it&apos;s been noticed. He&apos;s been missed. Anything that gets behind Frank [Lampard] or Steven [Gerrard], he&apos;s there to break it up. If Rio [Ferdinand] or myself step out of defence, you quickly call him back and he sits there. And if the right- or left-back goes bombing on, it&apos;s a case of me or Rio screaming to Owen to shuffle right or shuffle left to fill the role of that player.&quot; The way the Canadian-born Hargreaves played in Germany might have been what Terry had in mind when he spoke of the need for individuals to take more responsibility, starting tonight at the Ramat Gan Stadium. &quot;The training we&apos;ve done has been second to none, and it&apos;s something that over the last few years we&apos;ve all wanted. Now we&apos;ve got that and it&apos;s just a case of us showing we&apos;re good enough and brave enough to go out there and deal with it. If things aren&apos;t going too well for one, two, three or four of us, someone has to stand up and go, &apos;OK, I&apos;m going to take this by the scruff of the neck and do something on my own&apos;, which we see players do at club level. &quot;Our next four or five games, we basically need to win them all. Coming here, there&apos;s no other option. It&apos;s not a case of &apos;it&apos;s a difficult place to come&apos; - we&apos;ve had enough of that. It&apos;s a tough game, and they&apos;ve got some good players, but at the same time we&apos;re coming here as England and it&apos;s about time we showed people what we can do by picking up the three points. &quot;It&apos;s as simple as that. No excuses about being tired after the FA Cup replays, no excuses about it being a tough place to come, completely no excuses. It&apos;s down to us now.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T23:56:50Z", "title": "Terry talks tough and is ready to raise the volume", "sentences": ["If football pitches had the equivalent of stump-mounted microphones, then tonight&apos;s match in Tel Aviv would be needing a PG certificate."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/24/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Football tactics", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Partnerships come in all shapes and sizes, whether it be Archibald and Crooks, Greaves and Gilzean, Radford and Kennedy or Stein and Walsh. The correct formula may not necessarily combine a tall forward with a smaller partner, a cunning striker with a quick one, or indeed power with subtlety. Yet clever players always work together. Today offers a chance to scrutinise the cohesion and potency of Wayne Rooney and Andy Johnson. We accept that certain qualities are vital at the highest level - technique, intelligence, personality, speed - but scorers cannot generate goals unless they are receiving a liberal supply of opportunities. However, coordination with an unselfish partner and an ability to play in harmony are the most important factors. Do they respond? Are they capable of causing different problems? Rooney and Johnson certainly are. Israel will probably play with two strong centre-backs. Shimon Gershon - outstanding for Hapoel Tel Aviv against Chelsea in 2001 - and Tal Ben Haim are both tough, comfortable in the physical challenge, reasonably pacy and capable on the ground. So Johnson and Rooney can only be a threat if England supply passes into feet early. If Israel hound our back four early and force our defenders to play long and direct, we can expect little joy. Longer passes, less controlled, lead to a &quot;fight ball situation&quot; which will not suit England. We need to play through midfield so an alert Frank Lampard, Owen Hargreaves and Steven Gerrard will be vital to receive early and make the forward passes from lesser distances. Expect Rooney to come towards the play and gain possession of the ball as he attempts to drag one of the centre-backs away from his defensive colleagues (Fig 1). The United forward enjoys this role, finding space in front of the opposition defence. Johnson, on the other hand, prefers stretching defences, racing between markers for balls played beyond. If Israel sit deep, Rooney can join with Lampard and Hargreaves in midfield to monopolise possession and supply Aaron Lennon out wide. Conversely, should Israel play on the front foot from the start and attempt to squeeze the space, they will be forced to play a higher line and this would leave them susceptible to Johnson&apos;s speed beyond. Both strikers are more comfortable receiving angled passes and keeping the ball on the deck. It is important that, if Lennon breaks on the flanks, he appreciates as much and looks to play balls fast and low across the box. He must vary his dribbling instincts by playing a simple pass to feet when required. The movement of Johnson and Rooney will be crucial. They must balance each other. Occasionally, to break up the pattern, Rooney will need to look forward and Johnson come short in order to &quot;work&quot; their markers. When one is receiving near the box, the other must get around him to support (Fig 2) and that is where natural football instincts come into play. Imagination in the final third, with intelligent movement off the ball, is of a low quality among British players. Forwards should study films of Kenny Dalglish or Peter Beardsley. Let us hope that Rooney and Johnson can combine and coordinate to give England a convincing fillip.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T23:56:50Z", "title": "David Pleat's Chalkboard: Striking partners need movement and balance", "sentences": ["Shimon Gershon - outstanding for Hapoel Tel Aviv against Chelsea in 2001 - and Tal Ben Haim are both tough, comfortable in the physical challenge, reasonably pacy and capable on the ground."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/24/sport.comment2"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "There was more than one important match in Tel Aviv this weekend. Before England and Israel scrapped over European qualifying points in the Ramat Gan Stadium last night, Gretna FC gave Manchester United all the trouble they could handle in a downtown park on Friday afternoon. And Tottenham only just got by Reading. But the fans did not riot and there were no grumbles from the managers. There was nothing for them to complain about, in fact, because there was not one foul, not a dive, no wild-eyed posturing, not a trace of cynicism. Just honest endeavour and hugs and smiles at the end. So well behaved were the players, they did not need referees. Fantasy football? No, just another stunning reminder of how children can put adults to shame with the sheer power of their innocence. The symbolism ran deeper than the obvious football analogy suggests when 160 kids, aged between 10 and 14, from Arab and Jewish villages in northern Israel arrived in the capital to take part in the sort of cross-community tournament that makes you wonder where on God&apos;s earth our decency disappears to once little boys start growing facial hair. It was about football - and it wasn&apos;t about football at all. Playing in kit supplied by 16 English and Scottish league and non-league clubs, they provided a multicoloured mosaic as pleasing to the eye as those that decorate the temples of worship their parents regard as sacred. Except, consumed by the joy of their football, they left behind the prejudices that often go with religion. These were kids who normally would not spare each other a nod in the street - because they are not encouraged to. Most live in segregated towns and villages. If they share a town, they stay in their ghettoes. Members of the mixed teams did not necessarily know each other. Their parents might even have thrown rocks or something more lethal at each other. But the children remain unsullied yet. Arab girls, wearing jeans to cover their legs, kicked and ran alongside Jewish boys, and Jewish girls and Arab boys were thrilled to be playing in the colours of United, Spurs, Gretna, Reading, Nantwich, Wycombe, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, two Wealdstones (home and away), the England 1966 team, Wayne Rooney &apos;06, Kick It Out, Norwich, Ashford Town, Crewe and Wolves. No doubt there were a few Christians, maybe a couple of atheists, in there, too. Brendan Batson, the former West Brom player who has devoted much of his post-career life to fighting racism inside and outside football, was impressed. &apos;Did you see that?&apos; he asked as a girl kicked a ball into the face of an opponent, then stopped to pick her up and wipe away the tears. &apos;Remarkable.&apos; And it all was. You had to wonder why we would not see similar scenes in youth football in the UK, instead of the aping of adult excesses. In three hours of football on four pitches, there was hardly a raised voice. No scouts, either. Actually, there was one, John Lambert, who keeps an eye on South Coast talent for United, but he was here in his capacity as a senior lecturer in physical education at the University of Brighton. The university has been at the heart of the Football For Peace (F4P) tournament since its inception in Galilee seven years ago and Lambert was one of several colleagues and volunteers making it tick, helped by the British Council and the Israel Sports Authority. The FA and Kick It Out were there, too. So were the British Ambassador and Mayor of Tel Aviv. There is no lack of goodwill, it seems. John Sugden, professor in sociology at Brighton who has written widely about sport in divided communities, knows that football will not work miracles overnight, especially in a society as complex and blood-spattered as Israel. But, he says, neither should anyone of conscience ignore injustice. He reflects the measured optimism with a question mark inserted in the title of a book he has edited with another Brighton lecturer, James Wallis, Football for Peace? The Challenges of Using Sport for Co-existence in Israel. The modest aim, Sugden says, is to &apos;make pragmatic and incremental grass-roots interventions into the sport culture of Israel&apos;. It has not been easy. There has been resistance and suspicion. Arabs, 1.4 million of them, make up nearly 20 per cent of Israel&apos;s population. Eighty per cent are Muslim, most of those Bedouins - and few have been assimilated into football with much enthusiasm. While there are two Arabs, Walid Badir and Salim Toamah, in the national squad, club football is marred by bigotry. The New Israeli Fund, guided by Kick It Out, publicly identifies racist fans every week, particularly at Beitar Jerusalem and Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Israel&apos;s two most rabidly anti-Arab clubs. Racist chants such as &apos;Death to all Arabs&apos; dropped by 25 per cent last season, but even Beitar&apos;s most famous fan, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, has yet to challenge their influence. F4P is gathering momentum. It has a bigger tournament in the summer, attracting 1,200 players. I asked one boy what he thought of it and he just smiled, given his smattering of English. His language is Arabic. He does not speak much Hebrew. Nor would many of the Jewish children speak Arabic, so rigid is the divide. Their common language is football, expressed through all the flicks and tricks they have seen on TV. That is where the mimicry stopped, though. It was weird seeing football played stripped of the anger so ludicrously portrayed as passion at the highest level. Then, an awful and depressing thought invaded the optimism. Of the 160 bright-eyed youngsters scurrying about, how many would resist the call to violence that is so loud all around them? Who would be gunned down or sent to prison? Who might lose life or limb to a cowardly car-bomber? Last night, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, arrived in Israel for talks about a conflict that seems insoluble; today, the United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, will shuttle in to do the same. They will, no doubt, fly out as perplexed and frustrated as ever. Maybe they should have gone to watch some football in the park. The really important football in Tel Aviv this weekend was not that played last night by grown men behaving like children. It was the football played by children behaving like grown men ought to.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-25T00:32:21Z", "title": "Football pioneers bridge divide with child's play", "sentences": ["There was more than one important match in Tel Aviv this weekend.", "So were the British Ambassador and Mayor of Tel Aviv.", "The really important football in Tel Aviv this weekend was not that played last night by grown men behaving like children."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/mar/24/footballpioneersbridgedivid"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "&apos;He winks to the left, He winks to the right, Sky&apos;s boy Geoff Shreeves, Spoiled Ferguson&apos;s night.&apos; Apologies for adapting one of the more amusing Old Trafford chants, and I am aware that Manchester United fans normally sing &apos;plays on the left/right&apos; to avoid any suggestion that Cristiano Ronaldo might have anything to wink about, but the television interview that has been dividing the nation all week will clearly be remembered for longer than the FA Cup quarter-final and may even come to rival Kevin Keegan&apos;s plaintive &apos;I&apos;d love it&apos; rant in 1996. Sky were handed that memorable and much loved footage on a plate. A couple of routine questions and Keegan suddenly unburdened himself before a startled audience. Monday&apos;s drama was rather more forced. Considering Sky had hauled Ronaldo before the cameras to present him with the man-of-the-match award their line of interrogation was pointed, to say the least, and Ferguson was bound to be upset about his player having to defend himself against allegations of serial cheating. On the other hand, at least half the country is probably of the opinion that Ronaldo does cheat, or has in the past, and Shreeves would have been accused of ducking the issue had he merely patted the player on the back and complimented him on his performance. Not only did Shreeves show persistence and no little bravery in asking awkward questions, he was rewarded with the journalistic equivalent of gold dust when a slightly exasperated Ronaldo suggested one of the reasons controversy follows him around might be: &apos;Because I&apos;m too good.&apos; That quote was assiduously picked up by all the following day&apos;s newspapers, and just as with Keegan and &apos;I&apos;d love it...&apos; it is safe to assume it will follow Ronaldo around for some time to come. It will certainly turn up again before the end of the season, because the controversy that dogs Ronaldo is currently the only thing preventing him being a shoo-in for footballer of the year. Well, perhaps not the only thing. There is also Didier Drogba, whose goals in what still could prove an extremely successful Chelsea campaign make him Ronaldo&apos;s only rival for the individual honours. Drogba has done his share of diving, too, yet it is precisely the notion that he has cleaned up his act and concentrated on staying on his feet this season that makes him a more acceptable choice in many people&apos;s eyes. Deserving as Drogba might be, however, what with all the joy in heaven over a sinner who repents, the perception that Ronaldo remains unrepentant is what is currently keeping the Chelsea player in the running. That is why Ferguson will soon ban his players from accepting television man-of-the-match awards, or else send Carlos Queiroz to pick them up on their behalf. Not because he is unduly worried about where the player-of-the-season awards end up, but because when he is trying to persuade talented young foreigners to remain in this country it is not helpful to have them ambushed by antagonistic questions on live television. This is not solely a television agenda, either. Ferguson has only just finished calming his player down and persuading him he is valued in this country after the ridiculous furore that surrounded England&apos;s exit from the last World Cup when Wayne Rooney got himself sent off, but newspapers perversely chose to heap the blame on a certain winking Portugal winger. That stigma, to use Ferguson&apos;s description, still adheres to Ronaldo, who has unquestionably been the most exciting Premiership player on view this season despite attracting shrill criticism disproportionate to his actual crimes. Even Jonathan Woodgate, the player who conceded the penalty on Monday night, said Ronaldo had not dived. Suggestions that Ronaldo falls over too easily and makes the most of slight contact or minimal fouling are not groundless, but there are at least two members of the current England team who have won penalties for their clubs in exactly the same way this season, without coming anywhere close to inciting a riot. Ronaldo plays the modern game in a modern way - even Gareth Southgate admitted through gritted teeth last week that he is very good at what he does - and gets far more things wonderfully right than badly wrong. Make him a scapegoat for England&apos;s failure in Germany if you must, or use him as a convenient way of continuing to hate United while carrying a sneaky regard for Rooney, but let it not be said that in the Premiership we do not recognise an exceptional player when we see one. Because this could easily turn out to be his last season in England. Some people will be cheered up by that, but I intend to give him my vote for footballer of the year while I still have the chance. It makes me a hostage to fortune, I know, given that Drogba&apos;s goals could yet win the European Cup for Chelsea and Ronaldo&apos;s reputation for diving could resurface and make all his defenders look foolish. But, with respect to Drogba and Michael Essien, I don&apos;t think anyone has been as influential over the course of the season. That&apos;s why Ronaldo keeps picking up man-of-the-match awards, though if he receives any more character assassinations masquerading as bottles of champagne he should tell the interviewer where to insert them. He could feel the same way about recognition by football writers, too, and that would be just as understandable. He might ride off into the sunset like Gary Cooper at the end of High Noon, tin star tossed into the dust, bound for warmer climes where people appreciate him. Not too good for England. Just too good for a happy ending. Keane: Bonkers - but in a good way Roy Keane has always been frightening, whether kicking players into the air, intimidating referees by flexing his veins in their faces, crushing Ireland managers with calm expressions of withering contempt, or meaningfully walking his dog during brief periods of self-inflicted inactivity. Up till now, however, he has been a loose cannon, a rebel, a non-team player with no responsibility to anyone but himself whose frequent brushes with authority usually ended up hurting himself most of all. Put him in a position of authority, so the theory went, and he would soon see the other side, soon come to understand what a difficult job managers have in imposing order and a team ethic on spirited individuals with strong personalities. If managers from Sir Alex Ferguson downwards were waiting to see how Keane&apos;s edge would be tempered by the management experience, they are still waiting. We all are. Judging by his latest outburst, when he used a charity appearance in Dublin to promote Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind (I am not making this up, you just couldn&apos;t) to have another pop at the mediocrity and incompetence surrounding the Ireland national team, Keane is as outspoken and unapologetically caustic as ever. Only now he is a successful manager. A noted disciplinarian. A man in a results-led business with a whole load of good results already behind him. He cannot be dismissed any more as a lone voice raging in the dark. He is in the light now, above board, not drowning but waving. He might still be a bit bonkers but, as Hunter Davies has perceptively pointed out, the really great managers often are. Take a line through Bill Shankly and Brian Clough to Jose Mourinho. No one yet knows how this story will end, though it is not too hard to guess where it may soon be heading. If anyone bothers to look, there&apos;s some talent at Reading Did you know that only the top four teams have scored more Premiership goals than Reading this season? Or that of the 11 players who started their last league match, a staggering (by prevailing standards) seven were qualified to play for England? Reading are eighth in the table, and deservedly so, yet not one of their players came close to joining Steve McClaren in Israel this weekend. Fair enough, you might say. Reading are new kids on the block and the England team have been settled for some time. Steve Sidwell is not going to get a look-in while Frank Lampard, Owen Hargreaves and Steve Gerrard are around, and that&apos;s all there is to it. Except if Sidwell moves to a bigger club this summer, as he might, you would not be all that surprised were a call-up to follow shortly afterwards. And when McClaren is plundering the relegation zone (Luke Young) and even the Championship (David Nugent) for late squad replacements, Premiership successes such as Nicky Shorey and Leroy Lita must be wondering what they have done wrong. McClaren was probably right in deciding Tel Aviv would be no occasion for the inexperienced. But the flipside of that argument is that friendlies and less demanding home games could be used more imaginatively. Reading have got to be worth a look, otherwise people would not be advancing a case for Steve Coppell as the next England manager.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-25T00:32:21Z", "title": "Let's all dive in and agree that Ronaldo is footballer of the year", "sentences": ["McClaren was probably right in deciding Tel Aviv would be no occasion for the inexperienced."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/mar/24/letsalldiveinandagreetha"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Steve McClaren reckons you don&apos;t qualify in March. If he remained in charge of this time until the twelfth of never, England would not come close to realising even a fraction of their alleged potential. As it stands, England are slipping further away from Euro 2008, not to mention the expectations of their frustrated supporters. This was not so much dreadful - although it was a disjointed, unconvincing performance - as sadly predictable. England&apos;s travelling army of 7,000 or so were entitled to much better than a scoreless draw against a team who didn&apos;t do much more than run themselves into the ground all night. Yet, after ordinary nights against Croatia and Macedonia already, the boys might soon run out of patience. Aaron Lennon flickered here and there, Steven Gerrard and Phil Neville combined well down the right in the first half and Frank Lampard had a few chances in the second. But, overall, England travelled to the Promised Land more in hope rather than aiming for the stars. As for Israel, they are growing in self-confidence, a country whose sense of identity would seem to be more entrenched than that of a team who should know where their strengths and weaknesses are by now. Walid Badir, the experienced midfielder from Hapoel Tel Aviv, and Salim Toama, his 25-year-old team-mate, were the only Arabs in a squad that has much to thank that community for, in practical terms as well as playing their part in fostering the sort of coexistence between radically opposed political persuasions that other countries take for granted. Badir held his own in a busy, ball-starved midfield; Toama watched from the bench as his rival to lead the front line, Toto Tamuz, worried the life out of England. The 19-year-striker, whose parents had to leave him behind when they returned to Nigeria, was adopted by Israelis and had scored once in three appearances since being given a passport. He came close a few times in the first half. The anthems had barely drifted away on the warm night air before Tamuz had the majority of the capacity crowd on their feet, going around Rio Ferdinand with disconcerting ease, but blasting an off-balance shot wide. Neville, playing on the right in a rejigged back four, then did well to negate Yoav Ziv&apos;s jinking run, as Israel strove for a goal to put the superstars in their place. In the face of such early energy, England struggled for rhythm. Andy Johnson let a sharp pass run away from him, back to goal, and Lennon, on the left, where some say he is unsuited, took a while to settle. Arik Banado, one of five Beitar Jerusalem players in the line-up, was booked as the game jerked into gear, then Jamie Carragher followed. It was a fractious opening, both teams sparring nervously. Lennon, more relaxed now, did better with a darting run and chip, but Wayne Rooney&apos;s header didn&apos;t carry anywhere near enough beef and nestled into Dudu Aouate&apos;s arms. Frank Lampard came close. Doesn&apos;t he always in an England shirt? England had more of the ball, but Israel made better use of their scraps. Inside a minute, Tamuz, allowed far too much space, forced a diving save from Paul Robinson, and a wonderfully athletic header from Amit Ben Shushan&apos;s cross on Carragher&apos;s wing slid agonisingly wide. Big, strong and fast, the nerveless teenager was proving a handful. England were doing occasional good things as half time neared. A long, scintillating run by Lennon had Israel gasping and the defence did well to get in the way of Gerrard&apos;s strike from a knockdown, 30 yards out. John Terry was hobbling after a knock early in the second half, but looked comfortable enough when he ran it off. Pini Balili, Israel&apos;s midfield heartbeat, went forward at pace, turned and struck a first-time shot to the right of Robinson, who, motionless, we trust had judged it correctly rather than guessed as it went within a few inches of going in at the England supporters&apos; end. That might have ruined their night. Lennon, who runs the angles of attack so cleverly, some times retreating 20 yards to line up a cross or pass, almost had Rooney in but for the keeper&apos;s attentive leap. England had so much pace up front but the machine spluttered like an old banger. Johnson ran into too many dead ends, and the ball wasn&apos;t dropping for Rooney, who lingered too long on a long-range shot. All that class, all that skill - all that money - and so little to show for it against tacklers relying almost wholly on sweat. Israel had four players from foreign leagues; England had 11 from some imaginary land where reputation counts for more than effort. Lampard, desperate to see off his critics, showed a glimpse of his pedigree as he flew balletically and hooked a right-foot short hard at Aouate. Rooney and Tal Ben Haim were booked. Frustrations grew on both sides. And there weren&apos;t many satisfied customers in the stands, either. It was easy to see why visiting teams find cracking this stubborn Israel fortress so difficult. Lampard was nearly in again, as was Johnson, then Carragher with a decent header. But you had to admire the Israelis&apos; outstanding workrate without the ball. Tamuz gave way not to Toama but Elianiv Barda; they dreamt still of a goal from nothing. England&apos;s creative juices were running dry, meanwhile. Passes went astray, as did ideas. When Johnson ran into a hole on the right, unsupported, he did not try to hold the ball up, but tapped it meekly into the path of nobody in particular - bonehead football. The Everton man made way for Jermain Defoe, who slotted in just ahead of Lennon - until McClaren threw on Stewart Downing, not exactly like for like and not the sort of substitution to frighten Israel. Their excellent keeper did well again, to keep out Defoe and a share of the points was theirs.

England are all too settled in a recognisable style and it provokes dread that they will not feature in the Euro 2008 finals. Failing to win at the Ramat Gan Stadium is a common enough experience for visitors and the hostile reaction in the away end was that of people who had spent so much to get to Tel Aviv only to be presented with another impoverished performance. Steve McClaren&apos;s team have become prone to a dullness that is smothering their ambitions. Wayne Rooney&apos;s goal against Holland during the friendly in November is the only one England have recorded in five fixtures. The visitors had chances on Saturday but not of the sort that leave a goalkeeper powerless. Dudu Aouate saved at the feet of Frank Lampard following one of the midfielder&apos;s rare pieces of interplay with Steven Gerrard and the Chelsea mid- fielder had a later attempt that was dealt with unconvincingly. Apart from that England grimaced as a couple of headers slipped by and cursed when Aouate came out to block just as the substitute Jermain Defoe threatened to come up with a poacher&apos;s goal. This was no onslaught, merely a mild-mannered occupation of the opposition&apos;s half for much of the night. Gerrard roamed and strove to be enterprising but England as a whole were stiff, with no mercurial traits in mind or deed. Wayne Rooney gets held to account, above all, because of the sheer scale of his talent. Unless he plunders Andorra on Wednesday, it is perfectly feasible that the third anniversary of his last goal for England in a competitive match will roll around in June. McClaren is afflicted by a terrible shortage of dangerous forwards but it is the essence of a manager&apos;s work to cope with limitations. He does not appear to have any such knack, whether in switching tactics cunningly or in snapping a player out of his torpor. He has the air of a person bemoaning problems rather than addressing them. England&apos;s campaign is dragging on instead of progressing. In modern times no other manager has come into this post with quite so much to prove. That made McClaren&apos;s position precarious from the start and he will rightly be toppled from it should England be absent from Euro 2008. Only now do the public appreciate that the national team had been adept at qualifying campaigns since 1993. &quot;Many people said it&apos;s going to be a hard place to come,&quot; McClaren argued on Saturday night. &quot;Apart from the first 20 minutes we&apos;ve dominated and done everything we possibly could. Our final execution let us down.&quot; From his viewpoint this should have been the type of grinding 1-0 away win that everyone accepts. &quot;I&apos;ve done that in Europe and international football,&quot; he said. Breaking deadlocks, however, is the essence of management and England&apos;s substitutions came too late to have an impact. People such as Jose Mourinho thrive precisely because of that gift and McClaren, from the moment the FA anointed him, has struggled to show he possesses it. There was comparable powerlessness in the 0-0 draw at home to Macedonia. England, at most, were worthy against Israel. The shortage of deft or imaginative passing meant that Andrew Johnson was regularly using his pace to chase after the ball in wider areas when he had dreamed of striding through the channels between centre-half and full-back. Israel, in any case, were rugged in the heart of the defence. The excellent Tal Ben Haim settled accounts in full with Rooney after being part of the Bolton line-up that had endured the Manchester United forward scoring twice against them the previous weekend. Before flying out to Tel Aviv Gerrard sighed, only slightly in jest, at the thought that Rooney had used up all his impact against Ben Haim in the domestic arena. The players are as bemused as McClaren by all those qualities that are mislaid whenever they make the switch from club to country. If there is no remedy in the short term, the pressure increases to hit upon a pragmatic way of coping with the immediate challenge. England have not been doing that. One does not have to dream of a recall for Sven-Goran Eriksson to wish for the sort of qualifier when the team would muddle to a win. England opened competently on Saturday but the action drifted along and Israel, who had conceded four goals in their previous competitive fixture, were permitted to re-establish confidence. This was rehabilitation for a side that some locals believe has deteriorated over the past couple of years.

It had been expected that the players would be allowed a night out following the game but their social life was to be curtailed. &quot;They&apos;ll be in this evening,&quot; McClaren said. There had been a risk of trouble had the squad met angry supporters in the city. While there is no realistic option but to stand by the team he is increasingly unhappy about underachievement that, with over two months left of his opening season in charge, has already left him embattled. McClaren&apos;s tenure will not run beyond the end of this year if England fail to reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time since the 1994 World Cup. The side are third in Group E, five points adrift of Croatia and three of Russia. England need to finish as runners-up at least and McClaren has to place his faith in the fact that there are still seven games to come. &quot;There is still a hell of a long way to go,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to play Russia twice. We&apos;ve got to play Croatia. There are big games coming up.&quot; There have been just two wins and two draws, as well as the loss in Croatia, for McClaren in qualifying but he insists that England can rack up, say, five more wins if needs be. &quot;We have to believe that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to deliver. We have to keep going. And we will. I have confidence that we&apos;ll do the job.&quot; The manager has little option but to keep restating his faith in the players but each compliment invites criticism of McClaren himself, for not getting more out of these footballers of supposed standing. On Saturday the England supporters chanted &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing&quot; as Aaron Lennon was replaced by Stewart Downing. Few managers recover when there is so profound and vocal a denunciation. The Football Association is banking on the fact that four of the last five fixtures are at Wembley, yet the new stadium factor commonly inspires visiting teams and England will have to reach far higher levels to stockpile points. Victory over Andorra is almost unavoidable and the only rigorous examination before the game in Estonia on June 6 could be a friendly at Wembley the previous week, with Brazil regarded as possible opponents. England need something to revive their dynamism. The record of one goal from their past five fixtures is the worst for the national team since 1981. The mood is souring. McClaren returned to the dressing-room swiftly at full-time on Saturday. He did tell his squad to go to the visiting fans but those who began to do so met with animosity. There was also noisy disapproval of the squad as they boarded their bus. &quot;We understand their frustration,&quot; McClaren said. &quot;We&apos;ve all got it in that dressing room. [The players are] absolutely devastated. The way we controlled the game and quietened the crowd, we should have won that game.&quot; His theme is of a lack of finishing power. While Israel&apos;s home record is good, Croatia won 4-3 there in November and that kind of firepower is beyond England&apos;s imagining at present. McClaren is under suspicion precisely because he appears to lack any means, either through motivation or tactics, that will snap the squad out of its ineffectiveness. He is being undermined by the belief that the results, as well as being unsatisfactory, are symptomatic of the fact that he is not a first-rate manager. McClaren himself has been confronting his men with the fact that the efforts for England are not on a par with those for their clubs. He claims to be willing to drop a famous player if needs be. &quot;People must produce,&quot; McClaren said. &quot;They know that. They must perform. I think that was the message we got across this week.&quot; If so, the message could not be read in the display. McClaren is even obliged to state that his men do respond to him. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ve seen the reaction. This week they&apos;ve been tremendous. They&apos;ve got a responsibility, we&apos;ve all got a responsibility.&quot; The clear discrepancy between the attitude and the results is being ascribed to a lack of sharpness. Wayne Rooney, specifically, was bereft of it. &quot;Everyone&apos;s disappointed and no one&apos;s more frustrated than Rooney because of that,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;I feel as if the effort is there and the expectations from everybody. They are playing for England and they are playing for pride. They know that. They&apos;re as disappointed as you, as me, as the fans. We have to put it right. I know they will. If I didn&apos;t have belief in these players then we would be in trouble. I have belief in these players.&quot; Steven Gerrard, meanwhile, believes England may have to win all their remaining games if they are to qualify. &quot;There was already pressure on us beforehand and we haven&apos;t got the win we wanted, so there&apos;s even more pressure on us now,&quot; he said. &quot;As a footballer you&apos;ve got to deal with that and take the criticism of the supporters. It&apos;s understandable the fans booed us. We haven&apos;t scored in four of the last five games and we aren&apos;t winning games that we really should be winning. As an experienced player I&apos;ve got to take the criticism on the chin and it should be the same for everyone else, too. It hurts, it&apos;s not nice and I&apos;d rather it wasn&apos;t the case, but we have to be realistic and say that we owe these fans a lot more. They travel all over the world to watch us play, paying good money, and they want to see the team scoring goals and playing well. &quot;We&apos;ve got players who can score goals and everyone can see that in the Premiership,&quot; he added. &quot;But we&apos;ve struggled over the last four or five games in front of goal and we need to work on it in training.&quot; Gerrard&apos;s views were echoed by Frank Lampard, England&apos;s leading scorer in the World Cup qualifying programme but yet to manage one in five games of Group E. &quot;We have to treat it as a group problem,&quot; he said. &quot;We try to contribute from everywhere and it&apos;s disappointing for all of us, not just the strikers. We are in that patch of form where it is not coming off but there is only one thing you can do about it and that is not to moan or point fingers at anyone. It is to work hard to get out of it.&quot; Bilic buoyant Croatia&apos;s coach, Slaven Bilic, described England&apos;s draw with Israel as a bonus for his side after their 2-1 victory over Macedonia took them five points ahead of Steve McClaren&apos;s team and kept them two ahead of Russia at the top of Group E. &quot;We are glad England were held to a 0-0 draw in Israel,&quot; Bilic said after his side came from behind to win. &quot;This is a big win for us because the Macedonians have shown once again that they are a tough nut to crack.&quot; Croatia fell behind to a goal from Macedonia&apos;s captain, Goce Sedloski, but Darijo Srna equalised on the hour with a free-kick. He then set up Eduardo da Silva&apos;s 88th-minute winner. Russia continued their unbeaten start with a 2-0 win over Estonia in Tallinn, Aleksandr Kerzhakov scoring twice in 12 second-half minutes.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-26T00:23:17Z", "title": "England players denied night off", "sentences": ["Gestures of defiance are not normally associated with the build-up to a fixture with Andorra but the manager was forced to make them in the wake of Saturday&apos;s goalless draw in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/26/newsstory.englandfootballteam2"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "England"], "article": "Those England fans who travelled to Tel Aviv must have been left tearing their hair out at this performance. The same old problems that dogged the previous regime still hound this side and the lack of urgency on show was shocking. Sure, Israel set out to secure a point and were unbelievably negative. But, in the end, it was the home side who won the tactical battle. I find it baffling that England, with the talent in their squad, could not take advantage even against the Israelis&apos; defensive tactics. But the bottom line is they lack a midfielder capable of creating something out of the ordinary to pick open stubborn defences who sit back as deep as Israel did on Saturday. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are brilliant at running from deep but they lack the cleverness needed to create consistently. England had no ingenuity about them to break Israel down. There were times when Lampard or Owen Hargreaves would drop deep and accept possession from one of the centre-halves, then turn and find himself confronted by the entire Israel side. The home side were not playing 4-4-2 but effectively 4-6-0. Lampard would be put under pressure by a forward, not a midfielder, and would end up having to play back to his defence, with the ball then shuttled across the back line interminably while England waited for something to happen. But it was a case of &quot;Where do I go now?&quot; There was simply no forward thrust to this side. The problem was that there were no channels into which Andy Johnson could run and no space behind Israel&apos;s deep back line. Wayne Rooney was sucked deep in search of the ball but got lost in the clutter. Only when Aaron Lennon was in possession did they really threaten but he was played out of position. He was still coming up against two banks of four, confronted by a full-back and a right-sided midfielder, and I found it a mystery as to why he was not given a chance to run on the right. Steve McClaren had to try something different because this set-up was getting nowhere. It was crying out for either Kieron Dyer or Stewart Downing to be introduced on to the left wing but that would have meant taking Lampard off, moving Gerrard inside and switching Lennon. A manager like Sir Alex Ferguson would not have thought twice about making a bold decision like that but it is as if the idea of taking one of England&apos;s &quot;big&quot; players off is too much to be contemplated these days. That lack of pace and incision, and invention in the middle, cost England, though I would question their attitude too. Look what Scotland were achieving at Hampden Park on Saturday. There is simply no comparison in the level of ability between the Scots and those in the England team at present but what Scotland do boast is desire, urgency and a real will to win - everything, in fact, that McClaren&apos;s England appear to lack.

But before Steve McClaren&apos;s team toiled in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening, solace could be found at their new home. Wembley came through its final ramp-up event with wonderful ease and a safety certificate is due to be granted by Brent Council in the coming days. England&apos;s slipshod display against Israel is sure to raise concerns that Wembley&apos;s splendour will go unmatched by the capabilities of its incumbents and, as a collective, England&apos;s Under-21 side were far from impressive themselves, but the performance of David Bentley alone warranted cause for optimism. The Blackburn midfielder offered McClaren a timely reminder of his capabilities on an afternoon where polished football was at a premium. &quot;I was disappointed not to be named in the full squad,&quot; said Bentley. &quot;Hopefully I&apos;m close to a senior call-up. Every time I go on to a football pitch I have to prove why I&apos;m there and I feel this performance will influence my chances of figuring in the full squad. &quot;I believe in myself, I believe I&apos;ve got the ability, so maybe it&apos;s just a matter of time. If I get an opportunity, I&apos;ll go out and perform to the best of my ability. To play for your country is the best thing in the world. Playing for your country at Wembley is where every player wants to be.&quot; Bentley&apos;s name will be etched in the stadium&apos;s history after a 30-yard free-kick ensured he became the first Englishman to score in a proper match at the new ground. But his feat was overshadowed by Giampaolo Pazzini, who scored the first goal at the new stadium. After only 25 seconds the 22-year-old old Italian accelerated away from Nigel Reo-Coker and fired a drive that, with a deflection off Anton Ferdinand, beat Lee Camp at his near post. It was the fastest international goal ever scored at Wembley - old or new - and, if that was not satisfying enough, he went on to claim a hat-trick, the second following a Wayne Routledge equaliser and the third after Matt Derbyshire had given England a 3-2 lead. &quot;I am very, very proud to have christened Wembley,&quot; said Pazzini, who plays for Fiorentina. &quot;I was not even dreaming of scoring one goal, let alone a hat-trick. It has been an incredible day for me. When I went out the hair was standing on my neck. I have the ball from the match and all the English players signed it. &quot;That is the culture of the English, we do not do this in Italy if someone scores three goals. It is incredible. I will take it home and show it off with all my friends. I will have a party and celebrate my day.&quot; The two teams meet again in June at the Under-21 European Championship in Holland. Under the terms of Manchester City&apos;s agreement with the Football Association, Stuart Pearce is due to take full control once the season is over and his first point of call will be the defence, whose marking and tendency to relinquish possession were at times woeful. Italy&apos;s technical superiority and ball retention also helped them to dominate for large spells. For most of the 55,700 supporters in attendance - 4,300 did not receive their tickets in time - this was a day to celebrate, however. The stadium is one of the world&apos;s finest, even if it did not quite feel the same minus the Twin Towers and with the players emerging from the side of the pitch rather than behind the east goal. &quot;We feel so proud and privileged and to be part of the first game at the new Wembley and being part of history,&quot; Reo-Coker said. &quot;That is not something that many people get to do in their life. It is something I can look back on when I retire and say I was part of history. It is a priceless moment.&quot; Man of the match Giampaolo Pazzini (Italy)", "publicationDate": "2007-03-26T00:23:17Z", "title": "U-21 international: England 3 - 3 Italy", "sentences": ["But before Steve McClaren&apos;s team toiled in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening, solace could be found at their new home."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/26/newsstory.sport15"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "As Steve McClaren pointed out on the eve of Saturday&apos;s infinitely dispiriting draw with Israel, this is the fourth qualification campaign in which he has been involved. On the other three occasions England, having worked themselves into a difficult position, scraped through. All the current evidence, from their own matches and those elsewhere in the group, suggests that this one may be the exception. The difference, of course, is that McClaren is no longer the No2 on the bench but the undisputed leader. And now, having spent the last five matches compiling England&apos;s most barren run in more than a quarter of a century, he is looking ill-equipped to handle the task of ensuring that his team can face the immediate future with an optimism to match the gleaming promise of their new home at Wembley. After Israel had failed to land the blows that would have brought a deserved profit for their spirited first half on Saturday night, the game was there for McClaren to win. A few tweaks at half-time should have provided the ammunition for England to dispatch opponents showing the signs of mental exhaustion. Instead there was only more of the same as England continued to fire blanks. As John Terry intimated in his pre-match interview, the talented individuals within the England squad seem to lack the ability to break a stalemate by seizing the initiative. Not only does this demonstrate how England miss the imagination and unpredictability of the injured Joe Cole even more than Chelsea but it exposes the particular gulf between club and international football. Take Frank Lampard, who had yet another match on Saturday in which his international limitations were exposed. At Stamford Bridge he benefits from the subtle and intelligent instruction of Jose Mourinho, who drills his players in the arts of transition between defence and attack and vice versa. Under their club coach Lampard and his colleagues are in no doubt about their roles, both in the greater scheme and in any individual phase of play. Merely through a shortage of available time with the players, such intensive preparations are beyond the ambitions of an international coach, meaning that something else is required from both coach and players. At this level each player needs to have the authority and confidence to take responsibility for himself. He is there, in theory, because of his superior command of the game, and his minimum responsibility is to live up to his selection. That is the extra dimension of the international game and you could see it in Israel&apos;s performance in the opening 45 minutes against England, when such moderately gifted footballers as the midfielders Walid Badier and Amit Ben Shushan and the left-back Yoav Ziv made every ounce of their talent count and surpassed themselves as a result. England&apos;s players usually do the opposite. So cosseted and fawned upon in the Premiership, they continue to be fooled by their reputations into believing that their mere presence together on the park will be enough to ensure victory. So although they try hard - and no one could ever accuse them, particularly the unhappy Lampard, of lack of effort - they consistently fail to make the most of what they bring to the game. Terry said beforehand that there could be no excuses for a poor result against Israel and he was right. Dror Kashtan&apos;s team was there to be taken apart after half-time. McClaren tried to find consolation in the number of times his players got the ball into the box but coolness and invention were sadly lacking in the final 20 yards. It was amazing that the coach failed to switch Aaron Lennon, England&apos;s only real threat in the opening period, over to the right side in the second half, moving Steven Gerrard into the middle and pushing Lampard to the left or replacing him with Stewart Downing. So well equipped is Lennon to undermine even a defence as resolute as Israel&apos;s that he should have been encouraged to attack from every angle in the belief that sooner or later he would make the decisive opening, perhaps even from a position behind the strikers, where he could link with a becalmed and frustrated Wayne Rooney. Instead McClaren persisted with a formation that was clearly failing to provide the necessary penetration. A dozen goals against Andorra in Barcelona on Wednesday would buy the head coach a brief respite from increasingly hostile criticism without beginning to provide the answers England need. As he left the pitch on Saturday with the sound of jeering in his ears and his assistant, Terry Venables, trailing furtively in his distant wake, there was nothing to suggest that England are heading for anything other than their biggest disaster since the failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals. The way things are going, in fact, England&apos;s progress to Euro 2008 will require a great deal more than the late free-kick with which David Beckham sent England to Japan in 2002 or the goalless draw in Istanbul that secured their passage to Portugal in 2004. The qualifying campaign for last summer&apos;s World Cup finals may not have been a cakewalk but a narrow victory over Austria at least ensured their presence in Germany with a fixture to spare. This time the crisis may already be out of their hands. Who are the worst England managers?

No one ever claimed the same for Gazza. Or Paul Ince. Since then, Platt has flopped in his two pops at management, established himself as the dullest man in football- a competitive field - and, utterly bizarrely, got a gig as a frontline co-commentator for Sky. On Saturday night the outcome was sadly predictable. With England heading for a grumpy draw in Tel Aviv, the situation was crying out for Platt to offer analysis and answers. What could Steve McClaren do differently? What tactical tinkerings were needed to puncture Israel&apos;s 9-0-1 formation? Instead we got a masterclass in the Roy Walker school of punditry - just say what you see. But Platt wasn&apos;t alone. Everywhere you looked, pundits offered empty words and frothy football-speak. On Sky, Glenn Hoddle&apos;s post-match verdict was &quot;At the moment we&apos;re struggling a bit, at the moment&quot; while Jamie Redknapp claimed that &quot;England weren&apos;t clever enough&quot;. Where&apos;s Le Saux when you need him? The BBC, who had the benefit of highlights-package hindsight, provided little further illumination. In his interview with McClaren, Garth Crooks lobbed perceptive grenades like, &quot;You&apos;ve only scored one goals in five games, is that the problem?&quot; and &quot;Everyone is very disappointed. Is it now a matter of raising the confidence?&quot; All these people - from Trevor Francis to DJ Spoony, Ray Stubbs to Gavin Peacock - are highly prized as &quot;the talent&quot; in TV land. They have an army of backroom staff to cater for their foibles and faults: be it changing the autocue so that Rhyl is spelt Rill or providing them with killer stats on demand. Yet with all these resources behind them, Joe Average continues to be served a diet of fat, bland, uninspiring clich\u00e9. (In fairness to Francis, he hasn&apos;t always been so dull. In the mid-1990s, after his Sheffield Wednesday side had somehow lost to Wimbledon despite having about 387 attempts on goal, I - a young student hack - plucked up the courage to ask him whether he was looking to buy a striker. &quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; he sneered back. &quot;Klinsmann and Romario.&quot; There are the odd exceptions: Gary Lineker rightly receives a great deal of stick for his puns, which usually carry a whiff of Stilton about them, but on Saturday he asked all the right questions. He just didn&apos;t get decent answers. Perhaps he would be a better pundit than presenter; perhaps he needs to press a little harder. Another surprise was Mark Bright on Five Live&apos;s 6-0-6. On television Bright - sorry, Brighty - looks about as comfortable as a vegan in an abattoir, but on the radio he is often forthright and analytical. &quot;You say we need people with pace,&quot; he harangued one caller. &quot;But hasn&apos;t Aaron Lennon got pace? Hasn&apos;t Andy Johnson got pace? Hasn&apos;t Wayne Rooney got pace? We just didn&apos;t get behind them.&quot; &quot;Well, er, yeah?&quot; responded the chastened caller. Bright also dispensed his hubris-pricking with humour, a rare trait. Bright is certainly far sharper than DJ Spoony, whose main qualification for the 6-0-6 job seems to be that he&apos;s good mates with a bunch of players whose claim to fame is their all-night four-a-side matches in Ayia Napa a few years back. England&apos;s footballers might have failed to deliver in Tel Aviv but A Question Of Sport: Uncensored certainly lived up to its billing. This is a family newspaper, so some details must remain necessarily vague, but there was certainly enough to have the blue-rinse brigade of Mediawatch UK - formerly Mary Whitehouse&apos;s National Viewers and Listeners Association - muttering into their bottles of green Quink. Initially it looked like car-crash TV. When Sue Barker asked a question about Amanda Beard, Ally McCoist spent at least 30 seconds coming up with the sizzler that was &quot;Was her middle name &apos;Show Us Your&apos;?&quot; There were also endless knob gags, as well as McCoist sniggering &quot;Your place or mine?&quot; to a cackling Barker. But this schoolboy humour did at least show us that these sports stars had some personality, which is more than the post-match interview usually manages. Pippa Funnell, for instance, explained how she had to change her name to Philippa during the 2004 Olympic Games because &quot;Pippa is Greek for blowjob&quot; while an anecdote about the Australia scrum-half George Gregan&apos;s post-game celebrations involved being naked and doing something with a schooner bottle. Barker certainly revelled in the endless double entendres. &quot;I&apos;m looking for one on top,&quot; she said to McCoist at one point. &quot;That&apos;s the story of your life Sue,&quot; he responded, grinning away.

The harder part is to understand why players are under-performing and, in Wayne Rooney&apos;s case, it is particularly bewildering that England&apos;s best footballer is partly accountable for turning the famous Steve McClaren smile into such an anguished frown. McClaren was in such a state on Saturday night - sweating profusely, forgetting his lines - he was in no fit condition to offer a reasoned explanation about Rooney&apos;s perplexing form. However, it is known that the England manager picked out the youngster for special criticism in the dressing room. This is a debate that needs a clear head because Rooney, for long periods of his career, has been immune in the England blame game and something is clearly malfunctioning. Ask those England fans who chanted &quot;you&apos;re not fit to wear the shirt&quot; and &quot;what a load of rubbish&quot; here in Tel Aviv and the Manchester United striker will probably come last in the list of players they want sent to the stocks. Many will take umbrage to find their hero questioned. Rooney is the crowd&apos;s favourite, a spectator&apos;s player. And yet a newcomer to the sport could have taken a seat in the Ramat Gan Stadium and been forgiven for thinking that the visiting No9 did not even enjoy football. Here is a sportsman so talented that questioning his ability is the equivalent of taking Tiger Woods to task about his backswing or being disparaging about Roger Federer&apos;s serve. But there are legitimate reasons to be concerned. Who could have foreseen that Rooney would fail to score a competitive goal for his country since those thrilling days at Euro 2004? To scan the newspaper archives is to put his current form in context and be reminded of the differences in his performances between then and now. Le Monde encapsulated his style as &quot;poisonous to his opponent, making his elders look ridiculous&quot;. The facts, however, are stark. Since Euro 2004 Rooney has added 20 caps to his collection yet scored only three times, all coming in friendly matches: the 1-1 draw against Holland last November, a year earlier in the 3-2 win against Argentina and in the 4-1 win over Denmark in 2005. He has not scored in the Champions League for Manchester United since September 2004. His admirers are entitled to point out that Rooney&apos;s role in the team is far more complex than to patrol the opposition penalty area like an orthodox centre-forward. England may not have scored in four of their last five games but, as Steven Gerrard pointed out: &quot;You can&apos;t just point your finger at the strikers. It&apos;s down to myself, Frank Lampard, Aaron Lennon and other players to help the forwards score goals.&quot; The issue here, though, is not just one of goals. Rooney&apos;s body language, to put it bluntly, stank. He spent large parts of the evening remonstrating with the Norwegian referee, all arms and larynx, as he complained about nothing in particular. Had the game carried on much longer it is likely he would have been sent off before he scored. And this is not a one-off. Reports also indicate that Rooney&apos;s petulance continued into the dressing room following McClaren&apos;s post-match assessment. The more thoughtful United supporters will say, in simple terms, that the secret is out. Rooney has, at times, been beguiling this season but, increasingly, these have been sporadic moments. His club performances have ranged from outstanding to indifferent, yet the poorer performances have largely gone unreported while the team are winning consistently. As England set off for Barcelona yesterday he will be grateful the next game is against a ski resort.

Israelis are fiends for it. Whatever the circumstances, they see it as their birthright - the final piece in the Zionist jigsaw. Israel&apos;s most virulent critics take the opposite view. Whatever the circumstances, they wish Israel to be made into the exception. And last weekend&apos;s festivities in Tel Aviv, in which the drab goalless draw in Ramat Gan was only a sub-plot, provided the perfect opportunity to further assess Israel&apos;s place in the world. The match was an unequivocal hasbara success for Israel. For England, this was just another tiresome away game. For Israel, this was one of the biggest games in the country&apos;s history, and a chance to welcome the mythical England supporter - tattooed and bevvied-up, but cheerful and decent all the same. Despite this, most countries tend to greet English fans with fear. The Israeli authorities, however, preferred to adopt Jay-Z&apos;s dictum that sensitive thugs need hugs. English flags were paraded throughout Tel Aviv, supplies of beer were increased dramatically, and free transport was laid on. A special one-day festival was held in Tel Aviv&apos;s Hayarkon Park, with fun and frolics, including a chance for some of England&apos;s fans to see if their beer bellies could defeat their leaner Israeli counterparts in some friendly wrestling. The fans could not believe the welcome. They are used to being received by riot police, not adoring admirers. This kind of revelry is normally reserved only for the World Cup. But, for a country that&apos;s not always so competent at crowd control, police were sparse. I witnessed a friendly face-off between the two sets of fans on Tel Aviv&apos;s beach, in which the Israelis&apos; rendition of Shalom Aleichem, was greeted with English cries of &quot;Let&apos;s go fucking mental&quot;. Unable to free myself of inherited prejudices, I wondered whether I might hear the occasional anti-semitic chant. Not a whisper, although - on a different tack - I did hear a bit too much of &quot;No surrender to the IRA&quot;. Of course, however friendly the banter, it doesn&apos;t take much for trouble to start. But the hands-off approach to security was a tremendous success. Hopefully there&apos;s a lesson to be learned. The match also provided an opportunity to highlight the work of Kick Racism out of Football, an English creation which has now been exported to Israel. The New Israel Fund organised a weekend of activities to showcase the work of the organisation. The legendary John Barnes led a British delegation on a visit to Hapoel Abu Ghosh-Mevasseret Zion, Israel&apos;s first joint Jewish/Arab professional team. And at a gala dinner held by the New Israel Fund, Israel&apos;s first Arab minister, Raleb Majadele, gave his first official address. Much work remains to be done before the promise of kicking racism out of Israeli football (not to mention the wider society) is complete. But it&apos;s vital to know that serious work is being put into achieving this goal. However, we mustn&apos;t forget the arguments of the &quot;exceptionalists&quot;. Last week on Comment is free, Ismail Patel argued that Israel should be expelled from Uefa. Patel focused on the problems experienced by the Palestinian football team. These range from a missile hitting Gaza&apos;s only football stadium, to the difficulties faced when the team tries to go abroad to play a match. But because boycotting a team because of the policies of its government isn&apos;t a particularly frequent occurrence, Patel had to adopt the incoherent strategy tried by others who seek to demonise Israel - weird attempts to establish a universal principle through twisted logic: &quot;Although in an ideal world sports should be kept separate from politics, there is a different reality. Nazi Germany used the 1936 Olympics to showcase Hitler and his fascist ideology, which culminated in the Holocaust and the tragic deaths of 6 million Jews.&quot; And therein lies the rub. Nazi Germany did indeed use the 1936 Olympics to showcase Hitler and his fascist ideology. As we have noted, the Israeli football authorities used the occasion as an opportunity to welcome thousands of people from another country, and as a shot in the arm for the campaign to kick racism out of the sport. Followers of Patel might respond to this by admitting the value of these initiatives, and by arguing for them to be spread more deeply into society. This would not weaken their basic thesis. But, as ideological anti-Zionists, they are engaged in a project to systematically reject every aspect of Israeli society that does not proclaim its own deviance. And so they label projects such as Kick Racism out of Football as superficial attempts to cover up the deeper crimes of the Zionist project. Despite all this, there is a part of me that&apos;s not comfortable with thousands of Englishmen coming to Israel and thinking it&apos;s just the Republic of Tel Aviv, a sun-drenched paradise with beautiful girls and uber-chic bars. I have no problem with them knowing about the darker side of life here, which is one of the reasons I try and write as frankly as I can in this space. But I also want them to know the positive things. If someone like Ilan Pappe can speak of the &quot;many, many good things in Israel, it&apos;s an impressive project that the Zionist movement did, the way it saved Jews, the way it created a modern society almost out of nothing&quot;, then why can&apos;t Ismail Patel? I don&apos;t want people to boycott Israel, I want them to engage with it. I want people who are interested to come here and take an honest look at the good and bad things that are going on. Then, in whatever small way they can, to try and strengthen the forces of progress within Israeli society.

Rooney, in turn, has variously been reported to have stormed out, shouted back, or thrown his kit against a wall in response, but McClaren today refuted suggestions that he had lost the support of his players. &quot;It&apos;s an absolute load of rubbish. The togetherness of the squad has never been better,&quot; he insisted, before also denying having a problem with assistant Terry Venables, whose public comments on tactics have at times appeared to undermine the manager&apos;s authority. &quot;People are just trying to stir things.

However, I believe that the treatment meted out to Palestinian footballers detailed by Ismail Patel cannot be ignored if Israel wants to be treated as - in Alex&apos;s words - &quot;a country like any other&quot;. As the England football team prepared for its Euro 2008 qualifying match against Israel in Tel Aviv on Saturday, a modest shrine appeared briefly in London&apos;s Soho Square, placed outside the headquarters of the Football Association to commemorate the deaths of children killed while playing the beautiful game. The children in question are Palestinian boys who had the misfortune to be born under the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, now entering its fifth decade. Their fate attracted the attention of the Big (Boycott Israeli Goods) campaign, which includes a growing Jewish contingent known as J-Big. Its members placed the shrine at the FA&apos;s door to draw attention to the disastrous consequences of Israeli domination of Palestinian land. Further actions are planned for Israel&apos;s scheduled return fixture at the new Wembley Stadium in September. The following cases of youngsters killed while playing football are from one refugee camp near the Egyptian border, documented by Israeli human rights information centre B&apos;Tselem and the Palestinian Human Rights Centre. Khalil al-Mughrabi, 11, was hit in the head by a burst of gunfire in July 2001. Two friends, aged 10 and 12, were wounded. Jihad Hassan Barhoum, 16, was shot in the abdomen by Israeli troops in October 2004. A seven-year old was hit in the back. Ashraf Samir Ahmad Mussa and Khaled Fuad Shaker Ghanam, both 15, and 16-year-old Hassan Ahmad Khalil Abu Zeid, were shot dead by Israeli soldiers in April 2005. What security purpose is served by such actions? Even if killing children did make Israelis sleep sounder in their beds - a dubious proposition - is it acceptable behaviour for the forces of a state calling itself civilised and democratic? A nation which prides itself as a favoured ally of the west, which wants to play European football and compete in the Eurovision song contest? There is a dignified yet chilling website which documents the deaths of those under 18 on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It shows that in this game, the Israeli team has the opposition heavily outgunned. Between September 2000 and December 2006, 869 Palestinian children were killed, while there were 122 equally regrettable Israeli deaths. Last year 152 young Palestinians died. Two Israeli children perished in the same period. These grim statistics in themselves may not be a sufficient argument for boycotting a country&apos;s sporting activities, but the relentless system of oppression of which they form a part, is. B&apos;Tselem describes Israel&apos;s operations in the occupied territories thus: &quot;a separation-cum-discrimination regime, in which it maintains two systems of laws, and a person&apos;s rights are based on his or her national origin.&quot; Hundreds of checkpoints and barriers surround Palestinian villages and towns, turning the whole of the West Bank into a patchwork of ghettoised enclaves. Jewish-only roads criss-cross the landscape, linking expanding Jewish-only towns. The Israeli army deploys curfews and closures at will and imposes pass restrictions on more than 3 million Palestinians in territories it occupies illegally, in defiance of many UN resolutions. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa wrote in April 2002 of his distress on visiting the region: &quot;It reminded me so much of what happened to us blacks in South Africa. I have seen the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about.&quot; The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions has documented the destruction of more than 12,000 Palestinian homes during the 40 years of occupation. &quot;The Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza strip are now incarcerated in the world&apos;s largest prison without human rights and surrounded by walls, electronic barriers and soldiers,&quot; ICAHD said. Against all the odds a football team representing Palestine managed, briefly, to top their group in the qualifying rounds for the 2006 World Cup. They were due to play a crucial Asian zone match against Uzbekistan in Qatar on September 7, 2005, but failed to qualify after the Israeli authorities refused permission for five key players to travel. &quot;Every day they come to the border only to be sent back,&quot; said Tayseer Barakat, director for international affairs at the Palestine Football Association. &quot;Every time our players want to travel outside for training or playing, the Israeli authorities are blocking them.&quot; In April 2006, Israeli missiles destroyed Gaza&apos;s only football stadium. In this conflict, world leaders in the White House, in Downing Street and the capitals of Europe, talk of peace while acquiescing in Israeli aggression. This is despite the fact that a growing number of Israelis and diaspora Jews are pleading for a change of direction. They can see all too clearly that continuing annexation and settlement, enforced by military might, is ratcheting up the despair and readiness to use violence among Palestinians and simultaneously eating away at the heart of Israeli society. As long ago as April 2001, a group of Israeli citizens and Jews of other nationalities made the case for a boycott under the banner Matzpun (Hebrew for conscience). In July 2005, a long list of organisations representing Palestinian refugees, Palestinians under occupation and Palestinian citizens of Israel issued a call for boycott, divestment and sanctions. Refusing to buy Carmel avocados or to watch Israel play football will not in itself bring peace and justice to this tormented region of the world, but it may send an overdue message to Israel&apos;s leaders and their US backers. If their government cannot understand that peace for both Jews and Arabs depends upon justice and human rights for all then, like the apartheid rulers of South Africa, Israelis should face a boycott of their goods and a ban on official sporting and cultural ties with the rest of the world.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-26T15:30:08Z", "title": "An overdue yellow card", "sentences": ["As the England football team prepared for its Euro 2008 qualifying match against Israel in Tel Aviv on Saturday, a modest shrine appeared briefly in London&apos;s Soho Square, placed outside the headquarters of the Football Association to commemorate the deaths of children killed while playing the beautiful game."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/26/iacknowledgealexsteinsplea"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "SECOND CHOICE?

There&apos;s no doubt that Roberto Donadoni has achieved a lot in life.

Hell, he even made it all the way to the MLS&apos;s best XI in 1996 alongside hotshots such as John Doyle (nope, us neither) and El Salvadorian legend Mauricio Cienfuegos. There are two things Donadoni doesn&apos;t have such a grasp of, however: managing Italy&apos;s national side - the World Cup winners currently sit behind Scotland, France, Ukraine and Warwickshire Under-11s - and, worryingly enough for the manager of a side about to play Scotland, Scotland. &quot;I have not seen one player who stands out above the rest but they are good exponents of Anglo-Saxon football,&quot; Donadoni told La Stampa, ignoring the fact that the Celtic population of Scotland spent a good deal of their history trying to stop the perfidious Anglo-Saxons south of the border from nicking their land, Oor Wullie albums, Irn Bru chews and Carol Smillie calendars (swimsuit edition). Not that the Scots need much firing up for Wednesday&apos;s game. Their 2-1 win over Georgia on Saturday not only saw them become unofficial world champions, it also put them top of Group B. And from that lofty position there&apos;s a danger that Alex McLeish&apos;s men may embark on something never attempted by a Scotland team: attacking football. &quot;We&apos;re in a position where we could go to Italy and have a go,&quot; said McLeish between mouthfuls of deep-fried pizza.

The problem is thought to be so bad that Venables wants talks with McClaren after tomorrow&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier against Andorra to air his grievances. Venables has complained that he feels increasingly marginalised in his position as assistant manager and he has been disappointed by the frequency with which his tactical recommendations have been overlooked. He is said to be disillusioned and wants his role to be clarified after tomorrow&apos;s game at the Estadio Ol\u00edmpico. McClaren seemed taken aback when it was put to him yesterday, describing it as &quot;absolute rubbish&quot;, but it is known that Venables has contrasting views about the best way to take England forward. In particular, he is keen for the team to revert to a 3-5-2 system incorporating Jamie Carragher as a third centre-back. McClaren is a firm believer in 4-4-2 and had his fingers badly burned when he took his colleague&apos;s advice for the qualifying match against Croatia in Zagreb last October, a 2-0 defeat that set in motion the &quot;McClaren Out&quot; campaign led by many England supporters and several newspapers. McClaren&apos;s priority is to ensure England improve their goal difference against an Andorra side ranked No163 in Fifa&apos;s world rankings and who have already conceded 19 in Group E. Their limitations were summed up last night by one of their players, Toni Lima, declaring: &quot;If we don&apos;t get massacred, it will be a victory for us.&quot; The indication from the Football Association is that the chief executive, Brian Barwick, wants to give McClaren as long as possible in the job. However, the opposition to McClaren has become so loud and widespread it is inconceivable that the men in power at Soho Square are not considering whether they have made a dreadful mistake, one that would cost them around \u00a32.5m if they decided to sack the former Middlesbrough manager seven months into the job. It reflects badly on McClaren that his attempts to bring some discipline to the England dressing room after the scoreless draw against Israel on Saturday - the former Middlesbrough manager exaggeratedly slammed the door before remonstrating with Wayne Rooney - has apparently been a source of humour for some of the players and it will also count against him that he has been unable to form a strong working alliance with Venables. After the game in Tel Aviv the two men left the pitch separately, with 30 yards between them. Venables looked thoroughly isolated, his hands stuffed in his tracksuit pockets, and it has subsequently become apparent that he feels his role in the squad has not been as influential as he was originally led to believe. The two men will try to hammer out their alleged differences and McClaren, choosing his words carefully, spoke highly of Venables when asked yesterday if there was a &quot;rift&quot;. Having denied one, McClaren said: &quot;I brought him in because of his experience and the advice he can give to me. I take that advice on board. We talk all the time about football and this team. We are trying to get the best out of this team.&quot; Sources close to Venables, however, have indicated that the former England manager believes his advice is being ignored and is questioning whether the two men share the same philosophies about the sport. McClaren&apos;s appointment of Venables was a surprising one in the first place. They had never worked together and could not be classified as friends, and one of the few things Venables had never done in nearly 50 years in the game was work as a No2. His appointment was not an easy one for the FA to make - he left enemies behind when he finished as England manager in 1996 - and there will be consternation among Barwick and his colleagues that there are signs it is not working out. The experiment with 3-5-2 against Croatia, with John Terry playing as sweeper, was a tactical embarrassment for which McClaren, not Venables, took the blame and it is probably only to be expected that the manager is wary of taking advice to change the team&apos;s formation from 4-4-2 again. Venables has not done McClaren any favours either in his weekly column for the News of the World, particularly when he revealed after the Croatia game that Middlesbrough&apos;s winger Stewart Downing needed time out of the national team because his confidence had been shattered in the wake of criticism from the media and supporters.

Several FA councillors have run out of patience with McClaren only seven months into his tenure and there will be strong and vociferous recommendations for him to be sacked if England fail to beat Andorra tomorrow evening. Such a failure is regarded as almost unimaginable given Andorra&apos;s lowly status in world football but McClaren&apos;s tenure has become a subject of intense debate among the FA hierarchy and they intend to question him on his return to England about what they perceive to be a conspicuous lack of leadership. His critics within Soho Square have come to the conclusion that he was the wrong man for the job although, crucially, the FA&apos;s chief executive, Brian Barwick, is extremely reluctant to accept McClaren should be fired, not least because it would amount to an admission on his part that he badly blundered in appointing the former Middlesbrough manager in the first place. McClaren still has supporters at FA headquarters but they are being increasingly outnumbered and he will be asked to provide evidence to the 11-man international committee, chaired by the former Liverpool director Noel White, to support his claims that England are still on course to qualify for next summer&apos;s European Championship finals. Failing to reach the tournament would cost the already hard-up FA a multi-million-pound figure but it is considered a strong possibility at Soho Square and McClaren will be under pressure to put up a detailed and convincing argument. While the official line from the FA is that McClaren retains the full support of his employers, a different story is emerging behind the scenes, where there is criticism not only of him but of Barwick. Many of the FA councillors regret the decision not to replace Sven-Goran Eriksson with Sam Allardyce of Bolton Wanderers or Martin O&apos;Neill, who was not in work at the time but has subsequently become Aston Villa&apos;s manager. One of McClaren&apos;s opponents is understood to be David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman who is on the international committee. The reasons for the disenchantment hardly need an explanation, McClaren having overseen a run of five matches without a win against Macedonia, Croatia, Holland, Spain and Israel. In four of those matches England have failed to score, equalling the country&apos;s worst-ever run, set in 1981 when Ron Greenwood was in charge, and there has been an audible anti-McClaren campaign among the team&apos;s followers. In Tel Aviv on Saturday there were chants of &quot;what a load of rubbish&quot; and when McClaren replaced Aaron Lennon with Stewart Downing there was an angry rendition of &quot;you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing.&quot; By failing to beat a poor Israel side England have left themselves five points behind Croatia at the top of their qualifying group and three behind second-placed Russia. In total, McClaren has won only three of his eight matches since taking over from Eriksson, the last victory being the 1-0 win in Macedonia six months ago. Accomplished players such as Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard have been unable to reproduce their club form and, though similar accusations were made during the Eriksson tenure, it does not help McClaren that he was the Swede&apos;s assistant manager, with responsibility for taking their training sessions. McClaren has also had to counter an increasingly hostile media and there have been leaks from the dressing room that indicate his position is being undermined from within. All these details have been noted by the FA&apos;s international committee, which includes the governing body&apos;s chairman, Geoff Thompson, and the Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-26T23:39:06Z", "title": "McClaren called to account by FA", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv on Saturday there were chants of &quot;what a load of rubbish&quot; and when McClaren replaced Aaron Lennon with Stewart Downing there was an angry rendition of &quot;you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing.&quot; By failing to beat a poor Israel side England have left themselves five points behind Croatia at the top of their qualifying group and three behind second-placed Russia."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/27/newsstory.englandfootballteam"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "Cricket world cup 2007"], "article": "The Bob Woolmer catastrophe still beggars belief. It always will. My mind keeps returning to a serene, rewarding late summer&apos;s day in 1979 which I spent interviewing him for these pages at Bournemouth&apos;s pastoral Dean Park. We began at breakfast and finished at supper - and in between Bob scored a typically sound and classy century for Kent against Hampshire and Malcolm Marshall. He was still to play a few Test matches for England over the next couple of years but that day Bob was full of his new and imminent winter coaching post in Cape Town. He spoke with a missionary&apos;s zeal about the untapped seams of talent among the non-white cricketers, a fervour which was never to leave him. Later I was to come across Woolmer occasionally round the Test circuit and, when I did, his soft humours and enlightening theories always made him an appealing companion. We last had supper in London about half a dozen Septembers ago. The betting scandals surrounding his friend Hansie Cronje still reverberated but Bob remained in disbelieving denial. At least that evening I managed to lighten him up on the subject when I confessed I had been, long before Cronje, a guilty-as-hell accessory to a criminal Test cricket betting coup. Not only that, I had freely spent the ill-gotten gains without a qualm. In the new year of 1971 I was late-night duty sports sub-editor here, during which time I struck up a matey telephone relationship with another night-shift worker, a London Underground line ganger, a West Indian obviously so in love with cricket that he would ring the sports desk each night before clocking on, to ask for full and exact details which had been cabled in on the West Indies v India series in the Caribbean - Gavaskar&apos;s astonishing first bow and Bedi, Venkat, Sobers, Lloyd and Co strutting the stuff. I fed my telephone friend Lance (we were soon on Christian name terms) the lot: wides, no-balls, catches dropped, boundaries struck - so he could, he said, tell his army of fellow gangers during their meal-break. There were no 24/7 radio channels then, of course. The series ended in April, he never called again. Just one letter: a grubby envelope and an even grubbier twist of banknotes totalling \u00a335: &quot;Dear Frank of Sport, I&apos;m off home to start a business. Thanking you, Lance,&quot; wrote London Transport&apos;s master tea-break gambler. England wrong-footed On Saturday night I began to log the times England footballers in Tel Aviv used their &quot;wrong&quot; foot - ie: how many of them were, in the old jargon, &quot;two-footedly&quot; at ease on both left and right, once the yardstick for any half-decent player. Alas, the very notion was preposterous and I gave up after 20 minutes or so. Earlier on the radio Sir Tom Finney voiced his delight at David Nugent being the first England squad player from Preston North End since the great man himself 48 years ago; he was far too kindly to mention that Nugent is palpably a &quot;one-footed&quot; right-booter. Sir Tom is 85 next week. I looked up a piece I did on his 70th: &quot;I was a left-footer as a boy; out of the blue, at 18, North End gave me a youth-team chance - on the right wing. Afterwards our chairman, Joe Taylor, said, sorry, I&apos;d never make the top till I could kick equally well with both feet. So that&apos;s what I did: hour after hour, day after day, night after night, week after week I practised with my right foot. Practice, practice, practice. I even had North End trainer Will Scott feeding me ball after ball behind the main stand from every possible angle, me with a slipper on my left foot, a boot only on my right.&quot; Thus &quot;two-footed&quot; Tom played 76 times for England - some on the left-wing, some on the right, some even at centre-forward - and in his last World Cup match, in 1958 against Russia, &quot;privately to celebrate that apprenticeship&quot;, sweet as a nut he banged a penalty past the fabled Lev Yashin with his right.

Either way, the week-long spell of heavy rain and snow abated, giving way to azure blue skies and roasting heat on my final day before coming back to London for a fortnight, and this wasn&apos;t the first time it had turned out this way. Every time I leave my adopted country, Israel, she turns on the style in a last-ditch attempt to convince me that I ain&apos;t gonna find any better anywhere else, like a girlfriend trying to remind her lover that wherever he casts his eye, the grass won&apos;t be any greener. Suitably bronzed, and brimming with patriotism, I clambered aboard the minibus for the airport, with a last wistful gaze at the utopian scene I was leaving behind for the next two weeks. With my iPod inuring me against the Hebraic babble of my fellow passengers, I drifted off to sleep - and woke an hour later in what appeared to be a war zone. Granted, the whole country can be said to fall under that description, but we were next to the security wall at a checkpoint, with a group of Palestinian men being herded into a holding area by heavily armed soldiers not 10 metres away from the bus. Whereas once upon a time I was a mere tourist in this land, who would watch the proceedings with a detachment that allowed the sight to remain a mere fascinating spectacle, now I found myself sucked into the scene with a familial sense of inspection. And, having got myself into London mode a couple of hours earlier and looking forward to the relief of getting away from all this for a while, it occurred to me that this is to be my lot for the rest of my days. I&apos;m Israeli now - thus Israel&apos;s actions, whether up close and personal or through the prism of a TV screen, are doomed to affect me, involve me, and concern me forevermore. For all that upping and leaving for a trip abroad might seem like a way to put all the emotions on hold, in reality it&apos;s like being HIV-positive. I&apos;m not gonna escape it, wherever I find myself physically. Just as I write my pieces on Israel through Zionist-tinted spectacles, so this piece on my journey to London should carry a health warning. As I&apos;ve alluded to several times on my threads, there&apos;s no love lost between me and the city of my youth. For all the supposed beauty of England&apos;s capital city, it still leaves me cold - in every sense. I boarded the plane with the same trepidation that I used to feel when heading back to my army base after a weekend furlough. &quot;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,&quot; goes the prayer, &quot;May my right arm lose its strength.&quot; Sandwiched between two enormous Israeli frechers in my seat, the prophecy appeared to be double-strength in its manifestation - I was losing circulation in both right and left arms, and seemed doomed to suffer this fate for the remainder of the five hour flight. Earlier, at the airport, I&apos;d been told by the El Al minions that my place on the plane was not guaranteed, and that I might have to wait for a later flight - with the offer of a $200 cash sweetener to soften the blow. &quot;It&apos;s not a blow in the slightest,&quot; I told the waif-like girl behind the counter. &quot;Throw in a taxi back to my house, and I&apos;m happy not to go at all.&quot; If it hadn&apos;t been for my cousin&apos;s ill-timed barmitzvah, I would have been kicking back with all my English mates in Tel Aviv last weekend, downing lager on the beach, before heading to Ramat Gan to watch Israel take on the best footballers England could offer. An El Al flight to London is a good way of getting over the cultural &quot;bends&quot; that assail the Israeli tourist heading for the UK - there is a seamless blending of Mizrachim, ultra-orthodox haredim and non-Jewish tourists aboard the plane that aids the adjustment to life outside the Israeli bubble. That is what life in Israel does to even the most seasoned Londoner after a few years. While the streets of Jerusalem still resemble a Benetton advert, with the same mix of skin colours and geographic origins, ultimately every face you pass on the street is a Jew - with very few exceptions. London&apos;s streets are the polar opposite, by comparison - and believe me, I feel it the minute I alight the 747 at Stansted. &quot;They wanted me to take off my star,&quot; in the words of the mighty Another Way - and that&apos;s how it is for me as I wait for my luggage at the terminal carousels. I can feel the stares of the returnees from Ibiza and Majorca, as they clock the fur shtreimels of my fellow passengers, and gape at the sheitls of the wide-hipped wives alongside them. Hostile or not, their sideways glances remind me that, in the space of five short hours, I&apos;ve gone from being one of the silent majority, to one of the minority who&apos;d do better to stay silent than attract the attention of the tanked-up brickie walking through customs next to me. It&apos;s all in your head, I tell myself - and of course it is. But it&apos;s not just in my head. It&apos;s in the brickie&apos;s head too, as he peers curiously at the swaying tzitzit hanging from the yeshiva student&apos;s trousers. It&apos;s in the head of the cab driver as he loads up the luggage of the north-west London-bound expat, as he tries to work out how an Arsenal shirt can be so casually teamed with a knitted kipa. And, most of all, it&apos;s in the head of the Israeli first-time-abroad, post-army couple, as they wonder if the swastika on the bus shelter wall is meant for them in particular, or just any other minority group who step off the next plane touching down on England&apos;s green and pleasant land.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-27T09:30:00Z", "title": "Going home?", "sentences": ["&quot;Throw in a taxi back to my house, and I&apos;m happy not to go at all.&quot; If it hadn&apos;t been for my cousin&apos;s ill-timed barmitzvah, I would have been kicking back with all my English mates in Tel Aviv last weekend, downing lager on the beach, before heading to Ramat Gan to watch Israel take on the best footballers England could offer."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/27/goinghome"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "John Terry insists the England squad are fully behind manager Steve McClaren - and determined to get a convincing result in tomorrow&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifying match with Andorra.

Janet Rogan, who is Britain&apos;s consul general in Tel Aviv, was with a delegation of British Treasury officials, led by Ed Balls, the economic secretary to the Treasury, earlier this month. They arrived at the Jerusalem office of the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, ahead of a meeting with his chief of staff and his political adviser. The names of the visitors had been given in advance, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said yesterday. But security guards ordered Ms Rogan to undergo a physical search, the paper said. She refused and presented her diplomatic identity card. However, she was then made to step behind a partition and to undergo a physical search, which included removing her blouse. The Yedioth described the search as a &quot;prolonged, needless and humiliating process&quot; and said the diplomat was visibly upset.

Perhaps he focuses purely on the three points to be banked in Group E. It would be ideal, though, if England could convey a sense of style against Andorra, a team with nothing more in mind than orderly retreat. Considering the solitary goal England have delivered in five outings, their fans would cheer a spot of bullying in Barcelona&apos;s Estadi Ol\u00edmpic. The ambition to summon up a rout makes this an unusual fixture for McClaren. That, in turn, heightens the debate about the make-up of the side. This time the drilling of the defence is not a priority. Andorra, it has to be confessed, did outdo England by scoring in Israel but they still went down 4-1 and have conceded 19 goals so far in the group. McClaren, fully conscious of that, has been putting more emphasis on the preparation of the attack than at any time since, well, the last fixture with Andorra, a 5-0 victory at Old Trafford in September. To the manager&apos;s misfortune, Frank Lampard hurt his hand in training on Monday, in advance of a game that almost proffers goals to a midfielder who has not hit the net in the past seven England matches. In addition to damaging ligaments he is believed to have collected a hairline fracture, but with the aid of some strapping he still took part in training yesterday. England, bearing out McClaren&apos;s emphasis on risk-taking, attempted to get both Lampard and Steven Gerrard into the box during a session at the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic. An importance was placed, too, on crosses from Aaron Lennon and Stewart Downing. The intention must be to accentuate width as much as is feasible on a fairly narrow pitch, with a right-footer on one flank and a left-footer on the other. Assuming Wayne Rooney and Andrew Johnson are once more paired in attack, there might be no slot left for Owen Hargreaves. The defensive midfielder does help England retain their shape, but those disciplines cannot be so great a priority against opponents ill-equipped to make this game into a proper contest. McClaren is not so foolish as to set a margin of victory that would amount to a success. Even an England win will not automatically stop them from dropping a place to fourth in the group. Under Uefa&apos;s system, the position of teams tied on points is determined by drawing up a mini-league using results against one another. This means that if Israel and England both win they would join Russia on 11 points, still behind the clear leaders Croatia, with McClaren&apos;s side last in that list. Such a table would have an unpleasant look to it for McClaren tomorrow morning. He would urge more positive thinking. Should Israel be unable to overcome Estonia, England will occupy second place in Group E so long as they beat Andorra by a minimum of two goals. Since McClaren&apos;s team have yet to encounter Guus Hiddink&apos;s side they would then be in front of Russia, who are not in action today, by dint of a superior scoring record. It would be preferable to think about putting on a spectacle. Of an expected crowd of around 20,000, 16,000 will be English. Some will have barracked their team in Tel Aviv last Saturday and they are owed a little fun after so much expenditure. The game itself cannot be a chore to footballers who may derive real benefits from it. The Everton striker Johnson surely envisions a first international goal and Rooney, who has not scored in a competitive fixture since Euro 2004, may have an even more severe craving. England will not rebuild their reputation tonight, but they ought to show at least that they can be entertainers.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-27T23:09:13Z", "title": "Desperate McClaren issues licence to thrill", "sentences": ["Some will have barracked their team in Tel Aviv last Saturday and they are owed a little fun after so much expenditure."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/28/topstories3.mainsection"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Call it peace process envy. If they have any sense, Israelis and Palestinians will have a bad case of it this week, as they eye with jealousy the photographs flashed around the world from Belfast. How they must pine for the luck of the Northern Irish, as they gaze at Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley sitting side by side, promising their war is over and vowing to govern their bruised land together. How the people of Tel Aviv and Ramallah must wish their leaders would show some of that same Belfast determination which, after a long, torturous decade, has finally wound up what once seemed an intractable conflict. Instead, Israel and Palestine watch months turn into years without progress. Now there is a chance to break the deadlock. The 22 member nations of the Arab League are meeting for two days in Riyadh, with the Arab-Israeli conflict high on their agenda. They are preparing to make a remarkable offer: if Israel withdraws to its 1967 borders, pulling out of the West Bank and Gaza, they will agree to a full and comprehensive peace, including normal relations, between the entire Arab world and Israel. This, in case anyone has forgotten, is what Israel says it has yearned for since its creation 59 years ago, the acceptance of a Jewish state in the Middle East by its neighbours. What&apos;s more, Israel has always feared that a separate accord with the Palestinians would not hold because the Palestinians would be too weak to make historic compromises - on, say, the holy sites of Jerusalem - alone. An accord with 22 Arab nations would remove all such worries. Any final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians would be underpinned, with the leading Muslim states giving their blessing to the concessions that would be required. And they would promise what Yasser Arafat never could: that the conflict was truly, finally, over. How could Israel pass up such a great opportunity? The answer is that it already has. The Arab League approved what began as the Saudi peace plan when it met in Beirut back in 2002. Among the signatories then were Libya&apos;s Muammar Gadafy and Saddam Hussein of Iraq. That&apos;s right: Saddam Hussein was ready to recognise the Jewish state. Nevertheless, Israel&apos;s then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, ignored the Beirut declaration, pretending it had never happened. Admittedly he was handed a gilt-edged excuse. The Arab League initiative came when the second intifada was at its bloodiest; indeed, the Beirut text was issued hours before a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 29 Israeli civilians gathered at a hotel to mark the Passover festival. Sharon was less interested in peace with Saddam than he was in rooting out Palestinian fighters in Jenin, and so the moment passed. An Israeli cliche is that the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In fact it&apos;s Israel that keeps missing opportunities - with the Beirut offer of 2002 the stand-out example. This week it&apos;s getting a second chance. That&apos;s not because the Arab states are undergoing a spasm of peace, love and flowers in their hair. It&apos;s all about hardball regional politics. A cluster of Sunni, self-defined &quot;moderate&quot; states are alarmed by the rise of Iran, whose aspiration to lead the Muslim world, to be a regional superpower and to acquire the bomb, terrifies Riyadh, Cairo and Amman as much as it scares Washington and Jerusalem. In their bid to block the feared Shia ascendancy, action on the Israel-Palestine conflict helps. First, any progress on the Palestinian issue would deny Iran and, just as importantly, the Islamist radicals in the moderates&apos; own countries - whose support is high and growing - one of their key recruitment weapons. The moderate regimes would show they too can act for the Palestinians. While they&apos;re at it, they hope a conciliatory stance on Israel will win US favour, necessary if they are to stand firm against the Shia &quot;arc of extremism&quot; they all fear. So much for the Arab states&apos; motive. Will Israel seize this chance, whatever its origins? The prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has hinted that there are &quot;positive elements&quot; in it worth pursuing. That&apos;s certainly true for him personally. Olmert currently commands what may be the lowest approval rating for any democratic leader in world history: a measly 2%. Mired in corruption scandals and about to face the verdict of a commission of inquiry into the debacle of last summer&apos;s war in Lebanon, Olmert finds his premiership stalled and in a ditch. &quot;He needs an initiative and this could be it,&quot; says one Israeli government official of the Saudi plan. He would have ample political cover if he gave Riyadh a positive response. His rivals, including former PM, Bibi Netanyahu, have spoken approvingly of the Saudi opening. At the weekend, a clutch of eminent Israelis, including former minsters and security officials, joined a similar group of Palestinians in calling for an embrace of the Arab initiative. Still, only a reckless optimist would be hopeful. For one thing, Israel retains major objections to the initiative as it currently stands. They don&apos;t want to give back all of the post-1967 territories, preferring negotiations, and maybe even a land swap, to arrive at final borders. The key obstacle, though, relates to the Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel&apos;s creation in 1948 and their descendants. The initial Saudi plan, first floated six years ago, spoke only of a &quot;just solution&quot; to the refugee problem. At Beirut the language hardened up, to include a demand that Palestinians have the right to return to their homes inside Israel. Israel insists that any such right would be impossible to implement, spelling the demographic end of the country as a Jewish national home: Palestinians should instead return to the proposed Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza. If Riyadh sees no return to the original language, Israel will refuse to engage with it. Above all, Olmert may just be too weak to act, even in response to the initiative of others. Any progress would eventually require concessions and he is in no position to make them. There is, however, something that can be done. Normally, in the Israel-Palestine conflict, it makes sense to call on Israel, as the stronger party, to make the first move. But in this wider conflict, between Israel and the entire Arab world, that same logic may not apply. There is, in fact, something the Arab world could do this very week. It was raised in an open letter written by Shlomo Gazit, the former head of Israeli military intelligence, and addressed to the Saudi regime. The former general called on the Saudis to bypass Olmert, appealing over his head to the Israeli people directly. Follow the path taken by Anwar Sadat of Egypt 30 years ago, Gazit urged: come to Jerusalem and call for immediate negotiations. Public opinion will rally and &quot;no government in Israel will be able to reject that kind of initiative,&quot; he wrote. It&apos;s a good idea, for it would call Israel&apos;s bluff. The country always says it wants peace; now the sincerity of that stance would be tested. If the language on refugees and borders were loosened, thereby denying Olmert a reason to say no, all the better. The current prime minister has made the mistake Ariel Sharon never did: he has lost the initiative. This would be a way for the Arabs to fill the vacuum, with a stunningly dramatic gesture. And if there&apos;s one lesson the world can learn from Northern Ireland, it&apos;s that a little bit of human drama and symbolism goes a long way. freedland@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2007-03-27T23:13:00Z", "title": "Jonathan Freedland: Time to call the bluff of the land of missed opportunities", "sentences": ["How the people of Tel Aviv and Ramallah must wish their leaders would show some of that same Belfast determination which, after a long, torturous decade, has finally wound up what once seemed an intractable conflict."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/28/israel.comment"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Diplomatic briefcases are unlikely to be dropped at news of Condoleezza Rice&apos;s call, on the eve of the Riyadh summit, for Arab states to &quot;reach out to Israel&quot; and show they accept it. Israel&apos;s insistence that negotiators begin by accepting its right to exist has already pushed normalisation up the political agenda. The desire to become a nation like any other is strong among war-weary Israelis. The problem for Palestinians is that normalising relations with Israel also means normalising an ongoing occupation, the circumstances which led up to it, and the racism that engendered within Israel. And that&apos;s before negotiations even start. For secular Zionists though, the dream of becoming an ordinary nation with its own Jewish football hooligans and Jewish riot squads has deep roots. Theodore Herzl, the founding father of Zionism, believed that attaining statehood would be a guarantor of acceptance by gentile society. He may have been right, but it came at a price. In mandate Palestine, Jews constituted little more than 30% of the population and owned just 6% of its land. The statehood endeavour involved the brutal dispossession of another people. It may have been the harshness of this reality that fostered a strain of naivety among secular Ashkenazi halutzim (pioneers). In Altneuland, Herzl himself imagined a future state where a proud Ottoman Muslim called Rashid Bey would embrace the Zionist enterprise and join his Jewish friends on sightseeing tours. During one visit to the Valley of Jezreel, Herzl had Bey point out flourishing Arab villages and exclaim that they were impoverished hamlets before the advent of the Jews. &quot;Would you call a man a robber who takes nothing from you, but brings you something instead?&quot; Bey asks. &quot;The Jews have enriched us.&quot; Herzl&apos;s vision has now passed. But a &quot;look at the pretty flowers&quot; tradition of argument in Zionism continues. Last year, in the wake of the Lebanon war, Israel&apos;s foreign minister Tzippi Livni launched a public relations campaign to spread a &quot;more inviting&quot; image of Israel abroad. I was on the receiving end of a lobbying campaign of this sort myself in February, when a pro-Israel website encouraged more than 700 of its readers to complain to a British news group I write for, accusing my dispatches of singling out Israel for negative news stories. The complainants were politely rebuffed. The fruits of Livni&apos;s campaign may also have been seen last week in the normalised coverage of the Israel-England football match, and in the news that Israel&apos;s US consulate had successfully persuaded Maxim magazine to promote tourism by publishing a feature about the country&apos;s stunning models. Maxim is now reportedly sending a team of top photographers to the beaches of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. While they are there, perhaps they will incidentally record what could be the final days of the 497 residential properties that are slated for demolition in Ajami, Jaffa&apos;s last predominantly Arab district. According to Fady Shbita of the Arab-Jewish Sadaka-Reut (&quot;Friendship&quot;) organisation, as many as 2,000 people could be affected. &quot;There will be a serious struggle over this because it will change the whole structure of Jaffa if it succeeds,&quot; he told me. &quot;I would characterise it as a combination of ethnic cleansing or transfer and gentrification.&quot; The Palestinian-Israelis who live in Ajami will not be re-housed in Tel Aviv. Even if they could afford the rents here, it&apos;s all but unheard of for Arabs to live in most parts of the city. They won&apos;t receive compensation either, as they have technically been living in Ajami &apos;illegally&apos; for decades. Before 1948, more than 70,000 Palestinians lived in Jaffa. During the Naqba, the majority fled and were not allowed to return. Under the Absentee Property Act of 1950, their abandoned houses were seized by the new Israeli state and rented to Jews. The few Arabs who remained were concentrated behind a fence in Ajami. But times change. The fence came down and, in the 1970s, when beachfront property prices began to rise, Tel Aviv&apos;s Mayor, Shlomo &quot;Cheech&quot; Lahat, announced a policy of &quot;Judaising&quot; Jaffa. Building permits in Ajami were frozen and ongoing demolitions funnelled residents into the slums of Lyd and Ramle. Many of the 15,000-20,000 Palestinian-Israelis who stayed in Jaffa were forced to build extensions to their family houses without permits. This practice is now being used as the excuse for a new wave of the sort of soulless gentrification and transfer that has hollowed out Jaffa&apos;s old town. Much of the land reclaimed by house demolitions invariably gets sold on for luxury developments like the gated community of Andromeda Hill, &quot;a virtual &apos;city within a city&apos; surrounded by a wall and secured 24 hours a day,&quot; according to its website. Local residents complain that Andromeda Hill was built on land which was formerly owned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate &quot;so that rich Jews can enjoy the magic of the sunset in Jaffa without seeing Arabs&quot;. The Jaffa sunset can be truly spectacular but Israel&apos;s PR machine is unlikely to encourage photographers to wander the few yards down the road necessary to capture it from Ajami. For in this part of the world, it is arguable that beneath the flowers of normalisation lies the rubble of demolished houses.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-28T14:00:00Z", "title": "Normalising injustice", "sentences": ["Maxim is now reportedly sending a team of top photographers to the beaches of Tel Aviv and Jaffa.", "&quot;I would characterise it as a combination of ethnic cleansing or transfer and gentrification.&quot; The Palestinian-Israelis who live in Ajami will not be re-housed in Tel Aviv.", "The fence came down and, in the 1970s, when beachfront property prices began to rise, Tel Aviv&apos;s Mayor, Shlomo &quot;Cheech&quot; Lahat, announced a policy of &quot;Judaising&quot; Jaffa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/28/normalisinginjustice"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "John Terry has criticised the England supporters who targeted Steve McClaren and the players for near-unremitting abuse on a night of rancorous hostility here in Catalonia. McClaren was subjected to vitriolic chants from England&apos;s 16,000 followers in the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic and was visibly distressed when he stormed out of his press conference after taking only two questions. England&apos;s supporters had made it clear they want him removed from office and several players, most notably Stewart Downing, were targeted for sustained abuse, with loud boos ringing out every time a move broke down. &quot;To hear that during the game is not nice for the players,&quot; said Terry. &quot;The supporters are entitled to their opinion but I think for the players&apos; sake, and for England&apos;s sake, it would be better if they kept that sort of thing until after the game. The booing and the McClaren shouts are not helping.&quot; Terry said he understood the fans&apos; chants during the scoreless draw against Israel in Tel Aviv on Saturday but the captain made it clear he felt the crowd&apos;s reaction last night had been unfair. &quot;The players have stood up and accepted the responsibility for underachieving in recent games,&quot; he said. &quot;We have won the game but it hasn&apos;t been nice for anyone when you hear that sort of stuff.&quot; On a night when England&apos;s supporters called for McClaren to be sacked and the reinstatement of David Beckham, questioned whether they were watching &quot;Scotland in disguise&quot; and chanted for their money back, Steven Gerrard was equally shocked by the level of hostility from the stands. Wayne Rooney was booed when he slashed a first-half volley wide and Gerrard was targeted himself when he overhit a free-kick and it went out of play for a goal-kick with the game scoreless. &quot;The first half was as difficult a 45 minutes as I have ever played in an England shirt,&quot; said the Liverpool captain. &quot;We could hear what was going on and it was really difficult. The fans expected six points from the two games and, to be fair, so did we. But it isn&apos;t easy to play football with that kind of thing in the background. We could hear all the abuse and we had to show a lot of character to get through. At half-time we had to be strong mentally but it was a difficult experience.&quot; Owen Hargreaves felt that the referee, Bruno Paixao, had not offered enough protection. &quot;Some of the challenges were shocking and I don&apos;t think the referee protected the players enough at times. I told him numerous times. People could have got injured,&quot; he said. Terry, meanwhile, accepted that it was another performance deserving of criticism but he also pointed out that the team had not been helped by Andorra&apos;s tactics of &quot;cheating, diving and time-wasting&quot;.

Skipper John Terry admitted the chants were &quot;unhelpful&quot; and now Barwick, who was in Barcelona&apos;s Olympic Stadium to witness the events unfold, has spoken up to defend the manager. &quot;I know how hard Steve and everyone connected to the team is working,&quot; said Barwick. &quot;He is a strong man and I know from speaking with him just how determined he is to deliver success for England. &quot;I, like everyone else at the FA, will be doing everything I can to help Steve and the team win their next Euro qualifier in Estonia in June.&quot; The vitriol heaped on McClaren in Barcelona came just four days after sustained calls for his dismissal were heard during the goalless draw with Israel in Tel Aviv.

Are we on the point of doing a deal? Middle East analysts believe some diplomatic resolution might be clinched in the next few days. The first formal written communication from the Iranian government to the Foreign Office has been delivered and is being studied. But the going isn&apos;t easy. It isn&apos;t just the Iranians that our diplomats are having to steer around but the US and Israel as well. John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN could scarcely conceal his scorn at the British position when he was interviewed on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme this morning. He said that the Navy personnel had been captured more than a week ago and the &quot;only response of the UK is a draft statement in the security council&quot;.

The US began a major naval exercise in the Gulf this week off the coast of Iran, which is presumably the kind of extra pressure he means.

As the US and Israel see it, Iran&apos;s unjustified actions are almost welcome &quot;I told you so&quot; proof that the Tehran regime is dangerous beyond reason, showing that all western and &quot;moderate&quot; Arab countries must join in battering it into submission. That leaves Britain&apos;s 15 service personnel stuck in the middle. The extent of covert US operations against Iran is unquantifiable. There is no evidence that Britain is involved, although some knowledge must be assumed given the key role of British forces along the Iraq border. But the impact of Washington&apos;s and its proxies&apos; activities is increasingly measurable. Iran&apos;s complex ethnic make-up renders it especially vulnerable to external disruption. The population is roughly 50% Persian, 24% Azari, 8% Kurd. Iranian officials maintain Sunni Arab, oil-rich Khuzistan, abutting the Shatt al-Arab, is a high-value target for CIA and British subversion operations using agents linked to exiled resistance groups. Terrorist bomb attacks and other ostensibly separatist violence are a regular occurrence in Khuzistan. There were unconfirmed reports in January last year of an attempt to assassinate President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Ahvaz. The unrest has produced harsh reprisals, including a spate of executions. It is perhaps Iran&apos;s most sensitive border area \u2013 as the British captives have discovered. But Iran also accuses Pakistan&apos;s pro-western government and others of complicity in recent attacks on security personnel in mostly Sunni Muslim, south-eastern Sistan-Baluchistan province. Apart from strengthening internal opposition, the supposed American aim is to block a gas pipeline that would transit Baluchistan en route to India. The US has been pressing Delhi to scrap the project, in the same way that it is urging Turkey, European countries and oil companies to cut Iranian energy ties. Iran&apos;s hardline interior minister, Mustafa Pour-Mohammadi, alleged a nationwide conspiracy last month. &quot;Iranian intelligence services have acquired information that show the US, Britain and Israel have been behind the unrest in various parts of Iran, including Khuzistan, Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan in the past few years,&quot; he told the Aftab news agency. Kurdistan is another key pressure point. Turkish sources in Ankara back Tehran&apos;s assertions that the US is funding and indirectly arming the Kurdistan Free Life party, a sister organisation of the proscribed terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers&apos; party. The result has been increased, sporadic violence between Iranian Kurds and security forces \u2013 and a de facto anti-Kurdish alliance between Ankara and Tehran that reportedly led at one point to cross-border shelling of Kurdish positions by Iranian artillery. Iranian officials place the row over the British captives in the broader context of escalating, multi-dimensional pressure on Tehran orchestrated by the US. Acknowledged, as opposed to covert, American policy avenues include bilateral and UN sanctions relating to the nuclear issue; ongoing attempts to choke the development of Iran&apos;s oil and other industries by curtailing access to the international banking system, foreign investment and (mostly European) export credits; and this week&apos;s unsubtle demonstration of US naval and aerial power on Iran&apos;s doorstep in the Gulf. The US exercises went ahead despite the delicate position of the British captives \u2013 underscoring fears that Washington may try to exploit the situation even as London tries to defuse it. Nicholas Burns, a senior state department official, told the Senate yesterday that apart from trying to &quot;blunt Iran&apos;s regional ambitions&quot;, the US was seeking to change Iranian society from within. &quot;We are promoting greater freedom in Iran by funding a variety of civil society programmes ... to improve the free flow of information to the Iranian people [and] support human rights and democratic reform.&quot; The White House was requesting over $100m in related funding in the next financial year, he said, including year-round Farsi language radio broadcasts. For Iranian officials, all this, coupled with US squeezing of Iranian interests in Iraq and Washington&apos;s attempts to build anti-Tehran Arab alliances, looks very much like undeclared warfare. Whether it was pre-planned or not, their subsequent handling of the Shatt al-Arab incident may be their way of saying: Enough. But for American hawks like former UN ambassador John Bolton and Israeli hardliners, the crisis is confirmation of Tehran&apos;s malevolence \u2013 and proof that US pressure is telling and should be stepped up. They hope to use the standoff to persuade wavering European and non-aligned states to back their uncompromising stance on the nuclear and other issues. &quot;They [Iran&apos;s leaders] are mad,&quot; said a senior figure in Likud, Israel&apos;s rightwing opposition party, speaking in Tel Aviv. &quot;Our responsibility is to alert the world.

When making a delivery or purchase in Antwerp, Tel Aviv, New York or London, a bodyguard accompanies him. At meetings with suited-and-booted clients in the City, he has been known to wear threadbare jeans and T-shirt. &quot;It&apos;s just a precaution,&quot; he says. &quot;Other times I might wear a Richard James suit.&quot; When we meet, the security-conscious 37-year-old is wearing the latter. But the down-at-heel plainness of his office seems far removed from the image of his job. The first clue about the nature of his work is that his office is in a building in Hatton Gardens, London&apos;s diamond quarter. The second is that his firm, Duttson Rocks, is not listed on the directory in the building&apos;s foyer. There&apos;s the twin set of time-lock doors that have to be negotiated and the omnipresent security cameras. And, finally, his business associate wants to remain anonymous. &quot;You don&apos;t come into this room unless you trade and unless he wants you in this room,&quot; says Duttson. Duttson is a diamond broker and jewellery designer. He provides a &quot;bespoke gem-buying service&quot;. That means finding diamonds for rich clients, then designing the jewellery within which those lumps of tetrahedrally bonded carbon atoms can sparkle. Duttson&apos;s customers include Premiership footballers, top bankers, a very senior diplomat, as well as what he calls &quot;normal people&quot; who will spend up to pounds 15,000 on a rock. &quot;I went to New York over Christmas for a client because we couldn&apos;t find the right diamond here,&quot; says Duttson. &quot;In fact, my associate and I spent two or three days looking for this particular rock - a seven-carat emerald cut, which means it&apos;s oblong-shaped.&quot; When it comes to engagement rings, most fiancees know what they want from the off. &quot;I&apos;m seeing a lady at lunchtime who hasn&apos;t got a clue, which is rare because most women fantasise about what they are going to wear on their finger from an early age.&quot; Still, Duttson reckons he converts 85% to 90% of first meetings into sales. And eight out of 10 sales involve a gripper - a simple metal ring that allows clients to try on the diamond before it&apos;s set in jewellery. Duttson&apos;s job is not for the shy and retiring. &quot;I have to spend a lot of time with new people, learning what they like, gelling. I always meet people when they are happy, never sad. I have to travel a lot, too.&quot; However, Duttson did not meet the client who has, thus far, provided the highlight of his career. A man in New York phoned asking for some earrings for his girlfriend. &quot;I&apos;d met neither of them, but within the hour the money was in my account and I hadn&apos;t even bought the bloody stones,&quot; he says. &quot;Two years later he phoned me up again and we did another $175,000 [pounds 90,000] deal, again without meeting.&quot; De Beers is probably the name most people associate with diamonds. Despite major discoveries of diamonds in Russia, Brazil, Canada and Australia, the South African giant still dominates - critics say dictates - the global diamond market. However, Duttson sees De Beers as the &quot;police&quot; of the diamond trade. For many years, the industry was accused of turning a blind eye to the sale of blood or conflict diamonds, those sold to finance war and human rights abuses. To thwart this, the diamond industry - comprising 45 countries, including most of the diamond-producing nations - the UN and numerous NGOs adopted in 2003 the &quot;Kimberley&quot; certification scheme. &quot;Although conflict stones equate to under 1% of world diamond sales, that&apos;s still about pounds 50m, which buys you a lot of AK47s and has killed a lot of children,&quot; says Duttson, who is a passionate advocate of Kimberley. He shows me a diamond certified by one of the industry&apos;s main governing bodies, the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). The GIA certificate includes the carat, colour, clarity and cut as well as a serial number that corresponds to the digits lasered in the stone itself - digits invisible to even the most expert naked eye. &quot;The certificate enables me to trace the rock back to the source,&quot; says Duttson. Still, Amnesty International and the UN are concerned that self-regulation threatens the integrity of the entire certificate scheme. Duttson says he is confident his diamonds are blood-free because he has faith in his two suppliers. One receives diamonds direct from De Beers, the other is a privately owned firm with offices in Israel, New York and Antwerp that employs Duttson&apos;s associate. Their first meeting is an example of how trust has more currency than cash in this line of work. &quot;When I started in the business no one would give me a straight answer,&quot; says Duttson. &quot;At a jewellery fair in Basle, Switzerland, I went around all the stalls. But, because I was new, no one would give me the time of day. Out of maybe 100 people, I met only two who would deal with me, and one of them is now my associate.&quot; The diamond trade is an honour-bound profession. &quot;It&apos;s the only industry I know where you can do pounds 100,000 deals without paper and it will stand up in court,&quot; says Duttson. &quot;It is all done by looking them in the eye, a shake of the hand and a single word: Mazal.&quot; Mazal is a Hebrew blessing for good luck or destiny - not something Duttson wishes on one of his former employees. &quot;For six months I taught this man about diamonds and sent him on courses,&quot; says Duttson. &quot;He was a really nice guy, we got on well. But one day when I came back from holiday he told me he was going to start his own business. I said in what? He said in diamonds. Next thing I find, he&apos;s using my jeweller, using my suppliers. So, I dropped them. He&apos;s now moved overseas - and good riddance.&quot; Duttson himself is relatively new to the industry; seven years ago he was running an events management company. &quot;Then, one day, I turned around and realised I was 31, I was really knackered and I didn&apos;t want to do the job any more,&quot; he says. &quot;So, I walked out of the business I&apos;d spent 10 years building up.&quot; He recalled a childhood fascination with diamonds. So, he remortgaged his flat and headed for Antwerp where &quot;85% of the world&apos;s diamond go through&quot;. There he enrolled on a six-month diploma at the Hoge Raad Voor Diamant. &quot;I learned about the makeup of diamonds - that this one is an E and that&apos;s a F [colour], or that&apos;s a VS1 while this one&apos;s VS2 [clarity]. They also taught me how to use the tools of the trade, such as a Presidium, which we use to measure the dimensions of the stone. &quot;At school, I was rubbish at maths and physics and chemistry,&quot; says Duttson who left at 16 without any O-levels. &quot;But when it came to diamonds, I loved it because I could see the application.&quot; And he spotted a gap in the market, while window shopping on his weekends off - he would go to the big jewellers in Geneva or Paris with his then-girlfriend and pretend to be looking for a diamond engagement ring. &quot;It was always a spotty 19-year-old who didn&apos;t have the answers to any of the questions I asked.&quot; On his return to London in 2001, Duttson set up as a diamond broker. It was slow progress until a friend, Richard Relton, was about to get engaged. &quot;I said Dick, I&apos;ll go get a rock for you.&quot; Duttson went back to Antwerp and bought a round stone from an Armenian dealer he had met during his course. Duttson then turned to a former school friend and award-winning jewellery designer to make the ring. &quot;We worked together for about a year but it became a bit expensive so I looked for other makers.&quot; Duttson now works with a jeweller in the next door workshop to his Hatton Gardens office. He also has a 50% share in another workshop up the road. &quot;I&apos;m the man on the street doing what Cartier and Tiffany&apos;s do. Duttson Rocks has made more money in the first few months of this year than it did for the whole of 2006. And I know that this is a proper business now because I have repeat customers.&quot; One day he would love to have his own shop in Bond Street in London&apos;s West End. &quot;At this rate, in five years&apos; time there&apos;s no reason why this room shouldn&apos;t be gold-plated.&quot; Curriculum vitae  Current position  CEO of Duttson Rocks Qualifications  Hoge Raad Voor Diamant and International Gemological Institute: diploma in diamond grading  Gemological Institute of America: diploma in advanced diamond grading and synthetics detecting Career high  Searching for a seven-carat emerald-cut diamond for a client he has never met Career low  Losing his suppliers and jewellers to a former employee he had trained up", "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T22:50:01Z", "title": "Glam rocks", "sentences": ["When making a delivery or purchase in Antwerp, Tel Aviv, New York or London, a bodyguard accompanies him."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/mar/31/careers.work6"}, {"tags": ["Sport"], "article": "At the start of last week, when everyone was coming to terms with the poverty of the goalless draw in Israel, someone from within the Football Association let it be known that what England needed was &apos;a leader, not a coach&apos;. When considered carefully, this comment tells you all you need to know about the present undignified shambles surrounding the national team. 1) Steve McClaren is manifestly a coach and not a leader, so why did the FA choose him? When other available options included the dynamic and successful Guus Hiddink and Luiz Felipe Scolari, not to mention the charismatic Martin O&apos;Neill and the impressively gruff Sam Allardyce, what leadership qualities did the FA have a right to expect from the candidate who had spent six years as Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s bib-and-cone man? McClaren did not forge a reputation for leadership at Middlesbrough, where just over a year ago the fans flung torn-up season tickets in his direction and the senior players were credited with the turnaround that took Boro to an unlikely Uefa Cup final. 2) Real football countries set more store by coaching than leadership. Obviously a manager must have the respect of his players, but it is the personnel he selects, and the way he asks them to play, that should make the difference at international level. England thought this too as recently as 2000, when they appointed Eriksson on the strength of his perceived tactical ability. They had just tried an inspirational leader in Kevin Keegan, only for him to quit and admit he didn&apos;t know how to change things around on the pitch. 3) The FA themselves do not set much of a leadership example. The above quote was, naturally, unattributable. People such as Brian Barwick and Geoff Thompson rarely stick their heads above the parapet to say anything on the record, unless it relates to the number of toilets at the new Wembley or the size of the television deal just negotiated. Their lack of visible, public support for McClaren this past week has been sickening. They might not feel like supporting a man who has already lost the fans and has presided over some of the worst performances in recent memory, but not only did they choose him, they did so after one of the most extensive interview processes in history. Eight months on, McClaren is floundering on his own. The FA should either sack him promptly or back him properly, except that either would smack of firm leadership. For all these reasons it was not difficult to feel sympathy for McClaren on a windy Barcelona hilltop when he was the certain loser, whatever the result on the pitch. That much had been ensured in Tel Aviv, where the game threw up so little action the media spotlighted the discontent of the fans. Terrace anger actually first surfaced in Zagreb in October, when groups of supporters confronted England players as they left the stadium, although the next day&apos;s papers were full of McClaren&apos;s first defeat and Paul Robinson&apos;s howler. In Israel, there were no such distractions. McClaren heard the verdict from the crowd and the fans saw their feelings reflected in the media. These things quickly develop a life of their own and by the Andorra game the abuse had become both organised and intensely personal. The Brazil friendly before the next qualification game in Estonia in June may now see Barwick&apos;s second worst fear (behind non-qualification for Euro 2008) become reality. The FA could find themselves opening Wembley with full pomp and circumstance to 90,000 fans chanting for McClaren&apos;s head. Or calling him a wanker. Even if the inaugural Wembley audience is too polite for that to happen, you wouldn&apos;t bet against it in a subsequent qualifier. In the circumstances, it was unsurprising that McClaren ended his press conference abruptly with a catch in his voice and perhaps a tear in his eye. In doing so he managed to make himself the issue, despite avowals not to, but he is only human. It was just a pity that his scorn for the press made no distinction between the writers and the titles who have been childishly making fun of his predicament and those that have been offering more realistic assessments of the difficulty of the job. At least one journalist had been vigorously defending Frank Lampard in print on the very day the player was reportedly trying to book himself an early flight home. Is the job difficult? The man bellowing foul-mouthed insults from the Olympic stadium terrace appeared to think not, although Michael Owen offered useful perspective when he said that of his 80 caps he could count the number of excellent England performances over 90 minutes on one hand. Everyone should try this exercise. Over the past decade, most people&apos;s stand-out games would include results away to Poland and Italy en route to qualifying for France 98, Argentina at St Etienne in that tournament, the 5-1 against Germany in 2001 and - at a push considering the decisive goals came in the 89th and 90th minutes - the loss to France in Lisbon in Euro 2004. Victory over Argentina in Japan 02 was also impressive, although, as Owen himself admitted, England were hanging on for dear life at the end. So, what conclusions can be extrapolated from such a list? The first and most obvious is that England&apos;s best performances were all more than five years ago; the second thought is that Glenn Hoddle could not have been doing that much wrong after all; and the third observable pattern is that all England&apos;s best performances have occurred against top opponents in matches where the result mattered. This is the difference between England and, say, Northern Ireland, and why Lawrie Sanchez&apos;s excellent results and motivational qualities should not necessarily see him catapulted into McClaren&apos;s job. England have realistic hopes not just of qualifying for tournaments but of doing reasonably well once there. Their best displays will ideally be saved for when they need to progress past Italy, France or Argentina. It&apos;s probably best not to mention Portugal or Brazil. Northern Ireland do not attend many tournaments - although good luck to them this time - so for most of their players beating Sweden or England at Windsor Park is as good as international football gets. The situation provides the motivation in both cases. What you need from a coach is a means of beating the opposition. It is naive to expect England to be at the top of their game against Andorra or Israel. They need to be adequate in such matches and McClaren is struggling to deliver to an extent that people are starting to talk fondly of Eriksson&apos;s dull but efficient way with qualifiers. Ironically, England are quite likely to play well against Brazil - they usually do - or the next major team they meet. But that will be the players&apos; achievement, not the manager&apos;s. Senior players, in fact, are already taking matters into their own hands. John Terry and Steven Gerrard mean well - they are attempting to fill the vacuum that is forming around McClaren with some unequivocal support - but the only other time you hear players defend their manager in such a way is when he is a caretaker. The language gives the game away. McClaren is not going to be long-term. Even a sensational performance in Tallin is unlikely to save him, because he has nowhere to turn for support.

But I don&apos;t think I will be breaking too many confidences if I reveal he smiled a lot and made a few jokes but did not actually answer the question. A sly romance So Uefa have finally cottoned on to an idea that has been kicking around England for some time - that of giving the FA Cup and its European counterparts a boost by allowing the winners a place in the Champions League. Suppressing the urge to be cynical by suggesting this is merely a way of heading off Michel Platini&apos;s plans to cut the number of teams able to advance from leading domestic leagues, one could cautiously welcome a scheme that seems sure to restore some of the FA Cup&apos;s lost lustre. Except it is the Champions League, one way or another, that has been the ruin of domestic cup knockouts, and all the new proposals would guarantee is that the biggest clubs with the biggest squads would simply tighten their stranglehold on trophies such as the FA Cup. Were the changes intended to bring any romance back to the cups, they would have been proposed by teams such as Everton, Millwall, Yeovil or Inverness Caledonian Thistle. As it is, the prime movers appear to be Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Glasgow Rangers. No further questions. MURDER MOST FOUL Is there any chance of a moratorium on the grotesque fiction that the Cricket World Cup is still going ahead because it is what Bob Woolmer would have wanted? As platitudes go, that formula is just about serviceable when leading participants in a sport have died unexpectedly from illness or accident. Had Woolmer died of natural causes there seems every reason to believe he would have liked the show to go on. But he didn&apos;t. He was murdered. Poisoned and strangled by people he probably knew, for reasons that may not be unconnected with the game of cricket. In those circumstances, assuming anything about what Woolmer would have wanted is highly reprehensible.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T23:28:30Z", "title": "Wembley lynch mob haunts FA", "sentences": ["That much had been ensured in Tel Aviv, where the game threw up so little action the media spotlighted the discontent of the fans."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/01/newsstory.sport4"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Shimon Tzabar, who has died aged 81 of pulmonary infection, was a renaissance man: painter, writer, poet, and satirist, as well as an amateur mycologist - he discovered and named at least one species of mushroom. Above all, he was a rebel. Shimon was born in Tel Aviv in what was then British Mandate Palestine. His parents, who sold poultry in Carmel market, sent him to a religious school. He was a member of the Betar, the rightwing Zionist youth movement but was not accepted by its &quot;underground wing&quot; Irgun, the terrorist group led by the later Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin (obituary March 10 1992), because he questioned its rightwing views. Nevertheless, he was detained in the Latrun prison camp by the British authorities for several months. He was then recruited into the terrorist Stern Gang, but was later rejected when he expressed support for the idea of a Palestinian-Jewish bi-national state. Later he joined Palmach, the commando arm of the Haganah, the mainstream Zionist resistance during the Mandate. In the 1948 war, which created the Israeli state he was wounded in Jerusalem. At about that time, he joined the Hebrew communists, where he met his wife Naomi, and, together with other members of this splinter group, joined the Israeli Communist party, leaving it a few years later &quot;because I was bored&quot;. His first journalistic job, while still in uniform, was as the graphics editor of Bamahaneh, the army journal. He later worked as a cartoonist and columnist for Ha&apos;aretz and the weekly Haolam Hazeh. Shimon was a trailblazer in the struggle against the occupation and Zionist colonisation of the Palestinian territories after the June 1967 war. He was viciously attacked not only by the Israeli-Zionist establishment, but also by others who would later follow in his footsteps, albeit at some distance. On September 22 1967 he published a prominent advertisement in Ha&apos;aretz, signed by him and 11 others: &quot;Our right to defend ourselves from extermination does not give us the right to oppress others. Occupation entails foreign rule. Foreign rule entails resistance. Resistance entails repression. Repression entails terror and counter-terror. The victims of terror are mostly innocent people. Holding on to the occupied territories will turn us into a nation of murderers and murder victims. Let us get out of the occupied territories immediately.&quot; This was the first widely publicised protest in Hebrew against the occupation after the 1967 war and met with universal howls of anger. Now it seems prophetic. In December 1967 Shimon left Israel for London. In his (yet unpublished) autobiography, he says that his aim was to &quot;try to mobilise world opinion against the occupation&quot;. Shortly after his arrival he and some like-minded comrades published a satirical magazine, Israel Imperial News, which got favourable reviews in the British press but a stormy reception in Israel. Shimon relished these attacks; his aim was to provoke public opinion and get people thinking. He made numerous, varied and highly original contributions to modern Hebrew literature. His satirical anti-war book, The White Flag Principle: How to Lose a War and Why (1972), has been translated into nine languages. In 2004 he published the bitingly satirical booklet: (Much Better Than) the Official Michelin Guide to Israeli Prisons, Jails, Concentration Camps and Torture Chambers. Michelin started legal proceedings against him for using their distinctive format but - to his great disappointment - later withdrew the charge. Professionally speaking, Shimon regarded himself primarily as a painter. Aged 15 he joined Avni&apos;s art school in Tel Aviv and soon became a prolific painter with a very distinctive style. His artistic output, which included exquisite watercolours of hundreds of mushrooms, continued and even intensified during his last few years, despite his physical frailty. Shimon&apos;s artistry, originality and humour attracted a wide circle of friends and admirers who will greatly miss him. Shimon and Naomi separated in 1976. He is survived by her and their sons Yoav and Rami, by four grandchildren, and by Judit Druks, with whom he shared the last two decades of his life. Steven Balogh writes: Shimon&apos;s nom de guerre, Tzabar, means &quot;prickly pear&quot; and it has stuck in a good many throats. Bringing his genius to the 1970s west London squatter movement he applied art to his politics and politics to his art. His version of Guernica was a &quot;canniballage&quot; of Picasso&apos;s, complete with Israeli air force Mirage jets. His Dada objects included a patched kettle and a hammer with metal shaft and wooden head. Shimon&apos;s squat was his atelier and gallery, within it, I gradually became aware that I had entered his mind. The yarns of a roving correspondent - recorded in writings, paintings and anecdote - were simply too wonderful not to be true. He spoke the English language as a colonial subject, subversively, and he never stopped murdering it, in ways that had anglophones spellbound. We had little idea he was already legendary, we were his tribe and he is our legend. To publish his plays and outrage Jewish orthodoxy he invented the New Soncino imprint. It is difficult, in these times of instantaneous electronic publishing, to appreciate the work that accompanied this fecundity of imagination. His confederates were astonished by every exploit this polymath turned to. And grasping the potential computers offered, he made a digital key to the Inocybe fungus illustrated entirely with his own watercolours. Summing up Shimon by a sequence of events is peculiarly inappropriate: he led a non-linear life. Somehow there was always time for coffee with a friend, prodigious productivity never seemed to keep him &quot;busy&quot;. Shimon epitomised Taoist Wu Wei - achievement without effort. He said, and repeated just two days before his death, that even if one lives 1,000 years, year 999 has to be faced, eventually. We should, if we can, learn from him how to live life to the full, how to get old, how to endure sickness, and how to die. \u00b7 Shimon Tzabar, painter and writer, born March 5 1926; died March 19 2007", "publicationDate": "2007-04-01T23:03:47Z", "title": "Obituary: Shimon Tzabar", "sentences": ["Shimon was born in Tel Aviv in what was then British Mandate Palestine.", "Aged 15 he joined Avni&apos;s art school in Tel Aviv and soon became a prolific painter with a very distinctive style."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/02/guardianobituaries.israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Lebanon", "Equality", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Israel is still counting the cost of last summer&apos;s war against Hizbullah in Lebanon \u2013 though the final balance may not be entirely disadvantageous. Regional analysts say internally challenged Arab regimes such as Egypt were privately pleased to see a threatening &quot;sub-state&quot; actor like Iranian-backed Hizbullah knocked on the head. After all, they could be next. Arab-Israeli relations have followed an upward curve ever since the war, culminating in prime minister Ehud Olmert&apos;s weekend offer of multilateral peace talks without preconditions. Unconfirmed reports abound of secret meetings between Israeli and Saudi officials. Miri Eisin, Mr Olmert&apos;s spokeswoman, declined to address the issue directly: &quot;We have contacts with some Gulf states. Saudi Arabia is a central, important, stabilising factor in the Middle East.&quot; Yet far removed from such geo-strategic tussling, some of the most acute damage caused by Lebanon is only now coming to light in Israel&apos;s domestic hinterlands. A survey on patriotism by Herzliya University north of Tel Aviv, conducted primarily to assess the impact of the war on &quot;the Israeli spirit&quot;, found that national pride (expressed by 83% of those interviewed) and willingness to fight for Israel (92%) remained high. By way of contrast, the survey noted a &quot;very strong decline in confidence in the government and in the Knesset (parliament)&quot; and to a lesser degree, in the defence forces (whose &quot;approval rating&quot; fell by over 20 points). Most damaging of all was the war&apos;s negative impact on Israel&apos;s ethnic Arab minority, comprising about 20% of the total population. &quot;The Arab citizens identify themselves first and foremost as Arab patriots (85%), and then as Palestinian patriots (52%), and least of all as Israeli patriots (32%),&quot; the survey said. &quot;The war weakened the emotional attachment of the Arab public to the state.&quot; For example, only 45% said they would encourage their children to make their lives in Israel, compared with 58% in 2006. Nadia Hilo, the only female Arab Knesset member, said the war was only one element in a growing disconnect with Israel&apos;s Arab citizens. &quot;There&apos;s a definite problem of racism, there&apos;s more and more divisions, more and more alienation,&quot; she said. &quot;The real danger for Israel is inside if it does not give its Arab citizens equality and integration.&quot; Ms Hilo said over-crowded schools in Arab villages, higher than average unemployment, relatively few Arab women in the labour market, and separate security searches at airports were all aspects of an ingrained discrimination. To overcome such problems &quot;a national programme of positive discrimination with annual targets for employment of equally qualified Arabs&quot; was urgently required. Ms Hilo also complained the government was not trying hard enough to resolve the Palestinian conflict. &quot;We need some initiatives from Israel, not just responding, not just reacting. We have to be more pro-active. We can&apos;t just say Hamas is there so we can&apos;t do anything.&quot; Israeli Jews have mixed feelings about such criticisms, to put it mildly. One typical response is that the Arab, mostly Palestinian population, prefers to stay in Israel rather than move elsewhere; and that illegal immigration from the Palestinian territories has brought uncounted thousands of workers into the country. According to a government official, the results of earlier, limited attempts at affirmative action, in public sector appointments, have not been encouraging. &quot;The truth is they don&apos;t want to be seen to be working for the Israeli state,&quot; he said. Professor Amnon Rubinstein of Herzliya said the issue should be viewed in a wider context. &quot;Israel is changing very fast. Society is in a state of transition. The gap between Jews and Muslims is widening.&quot; He said there was recognition that the majority&apos;s attitude had to change.

Cooke and Pendleton defy inertia and put Britain at hub of world cycling Tony Cooke is more than just a proud dad. He knows that his daughter, the first British woman cyclist to top the international rankings, must fight for every scrap of publicity despite her presence among the nominees for last year&apos;s BBC sports personality award. And so every time Nicole Cooke races, he sends out a round-robin email. This season&apos;s communiques have brought uniformly good news: four big races, four wins. The most recent came at the weekend, when she pedalled to victory in the Trofeo Alfredo Binda, a 120km race in Italy. A week earlier, also in Italy, she led the field home in the Grand Prix Costa Etrusca. These followed two successes in Australia: a four-day race, the Geelong Tour, and in the opening round of this season&apos;s World Cup, in which she is defending her title. Like others who follow these things closely, Tony Cooke can see that for the first time she may be able to go to the world championships in Stuttgart in September with a team capable of helping her to fulfil her biggest ambition. Added to the British track team&apos;s magnificent haul of seven world titles in Majorca last week, his daughter&apos;s successes should lift the sport much higher in the nation&apos;s consciousness. In the velodrome, the equally gifted Victoria Pendleton left Majorca with three golds. Competing in disciplines taken very seriously by much of the rest of the world, and supported by the promising Shanaze Reade, Anna Blyth, Rebecca Romero, Tanja Slater and Anneliese Hurd, these two are doing something remarkable for women&apos;s sport in Britain, as well as for themselves. Tevez and Mascherano coming in from the cold One way of marking the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the Falklands/Malvinas conflict was to enjoy the weekend performances of Argentina&apos;s most recent arrivals in the Premiership. Carlos Tevez inspired West Ham&apos;s important victory over Middlesbrough, while Javier Mascherano looked as if he had been sealing up the Liverpool midfield for a decade. No one who watched the pair during last summer&apos;s World Cup could have mistaken them for anything other than players of the highest class. But on arrival in England last autumn - in curious circumstances - they lacked a manager with the sensitivity that Tottenham&apos;s Keith Burkinshaw showed when Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa were plucked from another Argentinian World Cup squad almost 30 years ago. Apparently it took the chants of West Ham&apos;s more perceptive supporters to persuade Alan Curbishley to give Tevez a chance. Even more amazingly, Mascherano had to leave Upton Park altogether in order to prove that his approach is ideally suited to the Premiership. Now that their paths have been cleared, perhaps they will go on to match the achievements of their fondly remembered predecessors. Flood, sweat and cheers Thanking his team and their sponsors after the recent Sebring 12-hours sports car race, the British driver Oliver Gavin was careful to praise the company that provided the air conditioning in his class-winning Chevrolet Corvette. &quot;It kept us sweat-free, pretty much, throughout the race,&quot; he observed. Meanwhile at Saturday&apos;s Head of the River event on the Thames, Cambridge&apos;s Boat Race crew completed the course shortly before rough conditions forced the event to be aborted, thanks to the provision of a pump in their craft.

Regional analysts say internally challenged Arab regimes such as Egypt were privately pleased to see a threatening &quot;sub-state&quot; actor such as Iranian-backed Hizbullah knocked on the head. After all, they could be next. Arab-Israeli relations have followed an upward curve ever since the war, culminating in prime minister Ehud Olmert&apos;s weekend offer of multilateral peace talks without preconditions. Unconfirmed reports abound of secret meetings between Israeli and Saudi officials. Yet some of the most acute damage from the war is only now coming to light. A survey on patriotism by Herzliya university north of Tel Aviv, conducted primarily to assess the impact of the war on &quot;the Israeli spirit&quot;, found that national pride (expressed by 83% of those interviewed) and willingness to fight for Israel (92%) remained high. In contrast, it noted a &quot;very strong decline in confidence in the government and in the Knesset [parliament]&quot; and to a lesser degree, in the defence forces (whose &quot;approval rating&quot; fell by more than 20 points). Most damaging of all was the war&apos;s negative impact on Israel&apos;s ethnic Arab minority, comprising about 20% of the population. &quot;The Arab citizens identify themselves first and foremost as Arab patriots (85%), and then as Palestinian patriots (52%), and least of all as Israeli patriots (32%),&quot; the survey said. &quot;The war weakened the emotional attachment of the Arab public to the state.&quot; Nadia Hilo, the only female Arab Knesset member, said the war was only one element in a growing disconnect. &quot;There&apos;s a definite problem of racism, there&apos;s more and more divisions, more and more alienation ... The real danger for Israel is inside if it does not give its Arab citizens equality and integration.&quot; Ms Hilo said overcrowded schools in Arab villages, higher than average unemployment, relatively few Arab women in the labour market, and separate security searches at airports were all aspects of an ingrained discrimination. She said &quot;a national programme of positive discrimination with annual targets for employment of equally qualified Arabs&quot; was urgently required. Ms Hilo also said Israel was not trying hard enough to resolve the Palestinian conflict. &quot;We can&apos;t just say Hamas is there so we can&apos;t do anything.&quot; Israeli Jews have mixed feelings about such criticisms, to put it mildly. A typical response is that the Arab population prefers to stay in Israel rather than move elsewhere; and that illegal immigration from the Palestinian territories has brought uncounted thousands into the country. A government official said the results of earlier, limited attempts at affirmative action, in public sector appointments, were not encouraging. &quot;The truth is they don&apos;t want to be seen to be working for the Israeli state,&quot; he said. Professor Amnon Rubinstein of Herzliya said the issue should be seen in a wider context. &quot;Society is in a state of transition.

We could each be censured for racism according to the European Union Monitoring Centre&apos;s &quot;working definition of anti-semitism&quot; which was last week adopted by the National Union of Students as official policy. This definition has lately been sweeping all before it, taking endorsements everywhere from the all-party parliamentary Report on anti-semitism to the US state department&apos;s special envoy for combating anti-semitism. The British government has pledged to re-examine its own definition of anti-semitism if the EUMC&apos;s successor body, the Fundamental Rights Agency, ratifies the new lingua franca. So it&apos;s actually a bit shocking to discover that the new definition was largely drafted by a pro-Israel advocate who gives talks on how to elide the distinction between anti-Zionism and hatred of Jews. Kenneth Stern is the American Jewish Committee&apos;s expert on anti-semitism and in Defining Anti-Semitism, a paper published by Tel Aviv University&apos;s Stephen Roth Institute, he explained how he developed the working definition &quot;along with other experts&quot; in the second half of 2004. Significantly, it involved crunching religious and racial hatred of Jews with what he labelled &quot;political&quot; anti-semitism. This latter, he claimed, has been &quot;otherwise known in recent years as anti-Zionism, which treats Israel as the classic Jew&quot;. Political anti-semites could thus include, for example, those who &quot;seek to disqualify Israel from equal membership in the community of nations&quot;, presumably by means of boycott initiatives. Naturally, comparing Israel to apartheid-era South Africa is also, within Kenneth Stern&apos;s framework, &quot;an expression of anti-semitism&quot;. His organisation, the AJC, boasts that during the consultation period, the EUMC accepted its invitation to convene a consultation over the working definition. Unlike some of the other Jewish contributors to the consultation process, the AJC&apos;s mission statement lists building support for &quot;Israel&apos;s quest for peace and security&quot; and countering &quot;the treatment of Israel at the United Nations&quot; among its most pressing concerns. But Stern seems to be particularly interested in discrediting anti-Zionism. The flyer for a meeting on &quot;anti-semitism and anti-Zionism&quot;, which he is giving next month, says he will be addressing the question: &quot;What are the essential ingredients of strategies to combat anti-Zionism as anti-semitism both here and abroad?&quot; At the risk of sounding flip, I&apos;d say that persuading policy makers to blur the difference between the two in their working definition might be a good start. The EUMC ended up doing precisely this. &quot;Anti-semitism,&quot; its report began, &quot;is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred.&quot; Such a perception could include stereotypical or dehumanising libels about, for example:  The power of Jews as a collective - such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.  But it could also include a litany of lobbyist shibboleths, such as:  Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (eg, by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour); Applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation ... Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis; Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.  Jewish peace activists have always balked at this last point, dissociating themselves from war crimes committed in their names. Sadly, Ehud Olmert was not so circumspect when, on July 7, he told the United Jewish Communities that the invasion of Lebanon was &quot;a war fought by all the Jews&quot;. By the new definition though, it might be an anti-Semitic &quot;double standard&quot; to single him out for criticism when the hateful words of the former Indian leader, Mahatma Ghandi, are still being taught in British schools. In 1938, Ghandi said he believed that &quot;Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French&quot;. Thus might he disbar himself from speaking at a British college today. Einstein, though, would really bomb. After the Deir Yassin massacre that killed more than 250 Palestinian civilians in 1948, he signed a letter to the New York Times describing the Herut Party (aka Likud) as &quot;closely akin in its organisation, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties&quot;. Its then-leader (and Israel&apos;s future prime minister) Menachem Begin, represented &quot;fascist elements&quot; in Israel, and his party had &quot;openly preached the doctrine of the fascist state&quot;. So Einstein, would flunk the EUMC&apos;s &quot;comparing Israeli policy to the Nazis&quot; test. But even higher forces than Einstein could fall foul of the Stern exam. After all, in Leviticus 25:23, God instructed Moses to tell the Jewish people that &quot;the land is mine; you are but tenants and travellers&quot;. What was this if not denying the Jewish people the right to their self-determination? Haul Him up before the AJC, Kenneth. The terrible irony of all this is that, on its current policy platform, the British National party might have few problems with the working definition. During the Lebanon war, for example, Lee Barnes, the BNP&apos;s head of legal affairs wrote on the party&apos;s website:  As a Nationalist I can say that I support Israel 100% in their dispute with Hizbullah. In fact, I hope they wipe Hizbullah off the Lebanese map and bomb them until they leave large greasy craters in the cities where their Islamic extremist cantons of terror once stood.  So Lee Barnes would pass the EUMC test. By comparison, Jewish anti-Zionists (such as myself) who have been physically attacked by leading members of the BNP and subjected to anti-semitic campaigns could face censure or worse. How have we come to this? Certainly, some Palestinians talk about &quot;Yehuds&quot; in a derogatory fashion, cite libellous texts without forethought and make foolish statements about the Holocaust. But that&apos;s what happens to language when you step on someone&apos;s throat. Black victims of segregation in the Deep South talked about &quot;honkys&quot; and Malcolm X&apos;s Nation of Islam preached that an evil scientist called Yaqub created white people in a test tube experiment that went wrong. This did not make them racists, because racism usually describes a concrete set of power relations, more than it does an abstract collection of prejudices. Of course, power relations can themselves be murky. When lunatic fringes of the pro-Palestinian movement try to forge alliances with neo-Nazis by blurring the distinction between Jews and Zionists, they should be opposed. But doing this is made much more difficult when Zionist ideologues and Brussels bureaucrats, for different reasons, blur exactly the same distinctions, only more effectively. That&apos;s why no-one should be intimidated from challenging them over their atrocious new guidelines. To paraphrase the old joke about feminists: How many pro-Israel lobbyists does it take to change the working definition of a lightbulb? One, and it&apos;s not anti-semitic to say so.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-05T15:30:00Z", "title": "When an anti-semite is not an anti-semite", "sentences": ["Kenneth Stern is the American Jewish Committee&apos;s expert on anti-semitism and in Defining Anti-Semitism, a paper published by Tel Aviv University&apos;s Stephen Roth Institute, he explained how he developed the working definition &quot;along with other experts&quot; in the second half of 2004."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/05/whenanantisemiteisnotana"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Religion", "UK news", "Society", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "Miljkovic Milivoje, a Serbian iron worker, had been up since before dawn. Mid-morning yesterday, he was sitting on a low wall opposite the Sixth Station of the Cross on the Via Dolorosa in the heart of Jerusalem&apos;s Old City. In his left hand was a walking stick and in his right a wooden crucifix he had bought earlier on his pilgrimage holiday after a long climb to the Greek Orthodox chapel on Mount Sinai in Egypt. It was Mr Milivoje&apos;s second visit to Jerusalem; the first was a Christmas pilgrimage. &quot;Now I have seen the complete circle, from birth to death. Can you feel the positive energy? It is everywhere.&quot; He sat surrounded by 46 Serbs from his tour group, all holding up crucifixes. They were waiting for a Greek Orthodox bishop, who was due to pass. Every few moments, a crowd burst up the hill, chanting, running and praying. They forced onlookers against the walls as they rushed past bearing large, wooden crucifixes carried through the Via Dolorosa to mark Good Friday. Before each wave of pilgrims, a handful of Israeli police and soldiers, their arms interlocked, tried to steady the crowds. A Palestinian shopkeeper stood on his doorstep, shouting in English, &quot;One by one, one by one&quot;. And to those who dared ignore his instructions to clear the road, &quot;What makes you think you&apos;re better than everybody else?&quot; These days the Via Dolorosa is paved with souvenir shops. Alongside the crosses and rosary beads on sale are baseball caps marked &quot;Israel Army&quot;. T-shirts with messages such as &quot;America don&apos;t worry, Israel is behind you&quot; hang next to posters with pictures from the British Mandate era that read &quot;Visit Palestine&quot;. The Old City was crowded with pilgrim tourists, partly because several of the largest Christian sects celebrate Holy Week and Easter Sunday on the same dates this year. The influx is partly due to the sense of greater security. After the eruption of the second intifada in 2000 and the wave of suicide bombings and Israeli military incursions into the occupied West Bank, tourists shied away. Now there are far fewer bombings. But Israel maintains its security concerns. For the Passover holiday, which this year coincides with the Christian Holy Week, the Israeli military declared a closure on the West Bank and Gaza, severely limiting the number of Palestinians allowed across checkpoints. Permits were issued for Palestinian Christians - according to a UN report around 8,000, although they were said to be scarce. Shopkeepers in the Old City said tourist numbers were still low. Farange Nashashibi, from one of the oldest Palestinian families in Jerusalem and owner of a souvenir shop, was particularly bitter. &quot;Before there wasn&apos;t even room to breathe, the streets were so crowded,&quot; he said. He blamed the conflict with Israel. &quot;There should be peace. There is no need to fight. The Israelis need to change their minds about us.&quot; Many of those walking through the Old City said they knew or cared little about the vexed politics of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Others were torn by their visit. Nessa O&apos;Byrne-Healy, 64, an Irish woman resting inside a chapel at the Fifth Station of the Cross, had been troubled by Nazareth, close to the vast West Bank barrier, and Hebron, a Palestinian city in the West Bank which is divided by the presence of a few hundred Jewish settlers. &quot;People have no idea what&apos;s going on.

Security officials blame an Islamist group. July 2005 Sixty-three people, including 11 Britons, died and more than 100 were injured by bombings in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Two of the attacks were suicide car bombings, while a third device was planted. An Islamist group claimed responsibility. April 2005 Three foreign tourists were killed by a suicide bomber at the Khan al-Khalili market in Cairo. Three weeks later, a bomb was detonated in another incident linked to the same militant group and a tourist coach was sprayed with bullets. There were no fatalities in those attacks. October 2004 Three terror attacks in resorts and hotels in Taba and near Nuweiba in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, killed 34 people and injured 159. They were the first terror attacks in Egypt since the 1997 killings in Luxor (see below). May 2003 Thirty-three people were killed and more than 100 injured by five almost simultaneous suicide bomb attacks on &quot;western and Jewish&quot; targets in Casablanca. Twelve of the 14 bombers, who were all Moroccan and had alleged links to al-Qaida, died in the attacks. November 2002 A suicide car bomb exploded at an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombassa, killing three Israelis and ten Kenyans. Minutes earlier, a surface-to-air missile had narrowly missed a plane flying to Tel Aviv from the nearby Moi airport. April 2002 Twenty-one people were killed and more than 30 injured after a natural gas truck loaded with explosives was driven into the Ghriba synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba. Fourteen German tourists, six Tunisians and one Frenchman died. Christian Ganczarski, a German national and a Muslim convert arrested at a French airport in 2003, is suspected of planning the attack. August 1998 Two huge bombs exploded near the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, within minutes of each other. The blasts killed 264 people and injured thousands. Twelve Americans were among the dead. The attacks were blamed on local supporters of Osama bin Laden, and brought his name to international prominence for the first time. In retaliation, the Clinton administration controversially hit a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan with cruise missiles, claiming the building was helping the al-Qaida leader to build chemical weapons. It later became clear that the evidence for such a link was weak. November 1997 Sixty-two people, including 58 foreign tourists, were murdered at an archaeological site across the Nile from Luxor, Egypt. Six gunmen, later linked to al-Qaida, posed as security forces before attacking the Hatshepsut temple, gunning down tourists indiscriminately. Thirty-five of the victims were Swiss, ten were Japanese and six were British. All the gunmen died after Egyptian security forces arrived.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-12T11:48:48Z", "title": "Timeline: terror attacks in Africa", "sentences": ["Minutes earlier, a surface-to-air missile had narrowly missed a plane flying to Tel Aviv from the nearby Moi airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/12/alqaida.terrorism"}, {"tags": ["Second world war", "World news", "Human rights", "Holocaust", "Israel", "Law"], "article": "Rabbi Bayfield&apos;s piece Never Forget attracted several critical responses - among them this one, from Mexicola: &quot;Does anyone, honestly, believe that all of this looking backwards is benefiting anyone? It smacks of &quot;wallowing&quot;. All we can do is keep telling the kids about these atrocities, keep showing them round museums which document them, but what else? I&apos;d have to agree with the &quot;what else?&quot; part of Mexicola&apos;s argument. As I wrote in my last piece, Zionist youth groups regularly take their charges to Poland for tours of the Nazi death camps - but, as I also explained, they do more than just &quot;wallow&quot; in the misery of 60 years ago: they learn from history&apos;s mistakes and come back to their home towns determined not to let racism, bigotry or prejudice blight their own particular worlds. But that doesn&apos;t mean that there is not still plenty of Holocaust-wallowing out there. The following story happened to me recently, and left me disgusted with the status quo in some quarters of the Jewish community regarding the &quot;untouchable&quot; side of the Holocaust. I went to Jerusalem&apos;s Museum on the Seam, where the exhibition on display, entitled Equal and Less Equal, explored the relationship between the exploited and the exploiters in the sphere of global labour. The art, by such luminaries as Santiago Sierra and Sebastiao Salgado, was extremely powerful and provocative, using video and photographs to evoke a sense of shame, guilt and horror every bit as powerful as a walk through the haunting corridors of Yad Vashem (Israel&apos;s Holocaust Museum). In fact, that last sentence was exactly what I wrote in the review I wrote of the museum, which I sent to the 40 or so people who read my unpublished pieces. The review basically exhorted us, as Jews, to open our eyes to suffering around the world, not just to that of our own people - and to acknowledge that there are human rights abuses out there just as atrocious as what happened to the Jews in Europe. I might as well have denied the Holocaust had ever happened, judging by all the abuse I got from a certain section of my readers. While most of them expressed agreement with the message I was trying to send out, a few middle-aged people (and I believe their age is important) went completely nuclear on me in their scathing attacks on the piece. One told me that my article had compared Israelis to Nazis, just because I&apos;d mentioned a video that showed browbeaten, dirt-poor Palestinian labourers as they traverse the Erez crossing on their way to work in Israel. If you read the original piece, you&apos;ll see that I did no such thing - but, as a relative of mine succinctly put it, the Holocaust remains the &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; of certain Jews: as in, &quot;You can knock me down, step in my face, slander my name all over the place&quot; ... but don&apos;t you dare go near the sacrosanct Holocaust and compare it with any other event in world history. Another reader told me exactly that, in a hysterical whine: &quot;You can&apos;t compare anything to Yad Vashem&quot;, she wailed upon reading the apparently offensive piece. Well, I said, you can. To cut a long story a little bit shorter, we never looked close to agreeing on the main topic: namely, that the Holocaust is so untouchable, so unique - so &quot;ours&quot; - that nothing on this earth will ever come close to being worthy of compare. &quot;Not even Bosnia, Cambodia or Rwanda?&quot; I asked quietly. At which point I scored my only point of the match. &quot;OK,&quot; she answered, &quot;but not sex slavery or cheap labour.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; I asked, causing her lips to go again. &quot;Because,&quot; she asserted, &quot;nothing&apos;s as bad as what went on in the camps: rape, torture, murder ...&quot; &quot;Hold on,&quot; I interjected. &quot;What do you think happens to these girls in Tel Aviv brothels? Exactly the same thing. And there&apos;re thousands of them, too.&quot; She went mental - even suggesting that some of them come of their own volition and that they are not forced to work at gunpoint (which is just plain nonsense). We could have gone on for hours, but she was missing my point. As I told her, my aim wasn&apos;t to cheapen the memory of the 6 million - quite the opposite, in fact: I was trying to honour them by showing that I had learned from the lessons of history and thus was not prepared to be doomed to repeat them. There is a holocaust going on nowadays the world over, in all but name. Sex slaves, slave labour, forced segregation and caste systems: straight out of the camps, and as prevalent in today&apos;s screwed-up society as ever. Just because the Brazilian gold miner at least earns a few pennies for his toil, don&apos;t think that makes him any less a victim than a Jew forced to sew buttons on to SS uniforms. Just because a sex worker at Tel Aviv bus station looks well fed and pretty, don&apos;t think there ain&apos;t a pimp with a gun behind the bedroom door. And don&apos;t think the mental scars of the Auschwitz &quot;good-time girls&quot; ran any deeper than that of Natalya from Odessa, held against her will and constantly abused on the fourth floor of a Bauhaus block of flats. It&apos;s not &quot;our&quot; exclusive preserve, the Holocaust. Yes, of course, we got well and truly done over, to a degree I can&apos;t even begin to comprehend. But that doesn&apos;t mean the evil in the rest of the world is not equally worthy of our attention. And thus, while &quot;never forget&quot; is a worthy and worthwhile refrain, it rings a bit hollow if all we do is remember without taking the next step and actively confronting abuses, wherever in the world they flourish unchecked.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-13T07:00:50Z", "title": "'Never forget' is never enough", "sentences": ["&quot;What do you think happens to these girls in Tel Aviv brothels?", "Just because a sex worker at Tel Aviv bus station looks well fed and pretty, don&apos;t think there ain&apos;t a pimp with a gun behind the bedroom door."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/13/neverforgetisnotenough"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Holocaust"], "article": "Vatican joins in Jerusalem Holocaust memorial The papal nuncio reversed his decision to boycott the annual Holocaust memorial outside the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem yesterday evening.

The Arizona senator&apos;s campaign listed $1.8m in debts, including $207,000 on its credit card, in a report to the Federal Election Commission. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani reported cash of $10.8m and debts of $89,000. Ex-Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney had $12m in cash.

With a 70% approval rating, the US-educated economist was expected to win the referendum with ease. Congress, which has dismissed three presidents in the past decade, is seen by many as running the country, long plagued by instability and poverty.

Buried there are the three patriarchs and four matriarchs of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths, and as such the site is of enormous spiritual importance. I travelled there during the relative lull between the first and second intifadas, and the journey from Jerusalem was a far simpler exercise than the average tourist would face today. As I prayed at one of the tombs with my father I glanced through a metal grille over to the other side of the chamber, where Palestinian worshippers were praying with equal fervour. So near, yet so far - a shared ancient history, indeed, yet a recent past that had divided the two sides almost irreconcilably, to the point that they could not even pray together in peace. And what a difference an intifada makes. The infamous security wall, the equally notorious maze of checkpoints, the tortuous inquisitions as you try to get from A to B, have all but destroyed the once-burgeoning tourism industry in the West Bank, as well as slammed the brakes on any interaction between the natives on either side of the divide. Hebron, as the more moderate Israelis and Palestinians love to reminisce, used to be one of several meeting points between the two peoples. Israelis on weekend trips would throng the bustling markets over the Green Line, buying up Palestinian goods and interacting with their neighbours in a way that seems almost incomprehensible to today&apos;s battle-hardened generation. Kipling&apos;s famous phrase - &quot;Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet&quot; - sounds apt for a region oft described as the fault line between the Arab world and the west, yet it doesn&apos;t quite tell the whole story. As Marina Benjamin vividly describes in her book &quot;Last Days in Babylon&quot;, Judaeo-Arab relations in the pre-1948 Levant were more often than not the epitome of successful integration. She paints a halcyon picture of Baghdad&apos;s Jewish community thriving amongst its Sunni, Shia and Christian neighbours - all of which ground to a halt once the Jewish State was established and relations between Arabs and Jews immediately soured. And so to today. To last Friday, in fact, when I drove with my friends from the homogeneity of affluent West Jerusalem to the coastal town of Jaffa which they call home. My friends, a recently engaged Jewish couple, are of a certain breed of hippy - they say &quot;shanti&quot; a lot, compete fiercely with one another in the hair-growing stakes, and are generally of the &quot;we&apos;re all G-d&apos;s children&quot; church when it comes to sectarian divisions. And it&apos;s lucky they are, since their flat is in the heart of Old Jaffa, thus nearly all of their neighbours are Arabs. As a consequence, what should be an extortionately expensive apartment - 100 square metres in an airy building, less than a kilometre away from the Med&apos;s golden sands - is available to rent at a fraction of the price of a similar home in a Jewish neighbourhood. For my part, while I never feel scared when walking the streets round their block, it is clear as day that my presence is no more than tolerated by their neighbours. People, gathered in their courtyards, stop in mid-conversation as I stroll by, all checking out the stranger in their midst - and who can blame them? I am, to all intents and purposes, no more than a painful reminder of events that have led them to become second-class citizens in the land they once dwelt in freely. The peeling facades and dilapidated streets of Jaffa bear witness to the neglect that a once-proud neighbourhood has fallen victim to - at once an extension of the golden mile of Tel Aviv coast, yet also a world away from the gleaming chrome of the skyscrapers down the road. And then we come to this afternoon. Inspired by no more than the opportunity to go where Israelis fear to tread - this time Bethlehem - my friend and I headed off for Checkpoint 300, less than two miles from my front door. The cabbie gazed at us inquisitively in his mirror as I told him our destination in perfect Hebrew. Israelis are strictly banned from entering Area A, which includes Bethlehem, but my British passport, my friend&apos;s American ID, and a healthy dose of chutzpah meant that we could circumvent the rules for the purposes of our trip. Upon brandishing our western papers, we were waved through cursorily by the border guards, who had bigger (and more Palestinian) fish to fry. Once through, we made our way through the deserted streets that characterise this side of Bethlehem. Strangled by the wall, choked by the non-stop incursions, the once-thriving tourist trap has now been reduced to a ghost town, devoid of any life save for the desperate crowd of taxi drivers vying for business. We were headed for the refugee camp of al-Aida, and were painfully aware of the massive shift in living standards of those unlucky enough to be the wrong side of the fence. Of the nearly 5,000 residents, unemployment has surged from 30% before the intifada to nearly 70% today - and it shows. If Jaffa&apos;s buildings are crumbling and worn, they look like mansions compared with the homes in Al Aida. The presence of the army hangs over the town like an ever-darkening rain cloud that threatens to burst at any moment. Youths and adults alike gather aimlessly on street corners, all eyes trained on the well-dressed boy and girl sauntering past in the afternoon sun. It&apos;s a place with no hope. As one man we met put it, &quot;everywhere else in the world, people look forward to the future, believing life will get better and brighter as time progresses. But in Al Aida, the here and now is the best we can hope for - every day gets worse and more painful for us. It&apos;s been that way since Oslo&quot;. And, whether or not the residents of al-Aida, Jaffa or Hebron could ever be won round to trust their Israeli counterparts as they once seemed to do, whilst the walls - both physical and mental - stand defiantly between the two sides, the chances of resolution grow slimmer by the day. So how does the rapprochement begin? It has to start from the ground up. As I&apos;ve argued before, nip it in the bud - get &apos;em while they&apos;re young. What little opportunity arises must be seized on - be it joint demonstrations, sporting events between peers from both sides, or weekends away for families of neighbouring communities. From the little acorn does the mighty oak grow.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-16T09:15:00Z", "title": "Never the twain shall meet", "sentences": ["The peeling facades and dilapidated streets of Jaffa bear witness to the neglect that a once-proud neighbourhood has fallen victim to - at once an extension of the golden mile of Tel Aviv coast, yet also a world away from the gleaming chrome of the skyscrapers down the road."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/16/neverthetwainshallmeet"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "The message in last week&apos;s Israeli press was clear. Tel Aviv had just avoided a bloodbath and Hamas were back in the business of launching suicide attacks against Israel. Anyone exposed to the Israeli media would have been left in no doubt that a tragedy had been averted and Hamas, after a three-year moratorium on suicide attacks against Israel, had reverted to type. The problem is that the Shin Bet press release that led to blanket coverage raises far more questions than it answers - none of which were asked by the Israeli media, or passed onto the Israeli public. According to a press release from the prime minister&apos;s office last week on behalf of Shin Bet, a Hamas terrorist drove a 100kg car bomb to Tel Aviv with the aim of blowing it up over the Passover holiday. The driver got past a large Israeli checkpoint and then drove through the towns of Kfar Sava and Herzliya before reaching Tel Aviv. For some reason, the &quot;suicide-terrorist&quot; had second thoughts and returned home to the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, where he parked the vehicle in a &quot;backyard&quot;, according to Ha&apos;aretz. By this time, Shin Bet awoke to the threat and, with the help of the army, arrested 19 suspects in Qalqiliya. According to the press release: &quot;During the aforesaid wave of arrests, the vehicle exploded in a &apos;work accident&apos;.&quot; The bomb would have had a devastating effect on Tel Aviv. According to Shin Bet, the vehicle was loaded with &quot;powerful explosives&quot; and &quot;considerable shrapnel&quot;. It is fair to guess the effect on Qalqiliya, where it exploded on March 14 or 15 according to the prime minister&apos;s office which deals with the public affairs of Shin Bet, would have been equally damaging. Qalqiliya is a small, densely-populated town of 33,000, which is almost completely surrounded by a 30-foot concrete wall. However, no one in Qalqiliya could recall any kind of explosion in the town in recent months. Ahmed Abu Hazar, a resident of Qalqiliya and Fatah member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said he first heard of the arrests and the bomb plot from Israeli media. &quot;Qalqiliya is a very small place and everyone know or hears what happens. I have asked my children, neighbours and friends, but they have heard nothing. When there was a small gas explosion a few months ago, everyone rushed to the scene, but about this we have heard nothing,&quot; he said. Riad Amr, the Qalqiliya correspondent for the Bethlehem-based Maan News Agency, said that he had reported on the arrest of 19 men in Qalqiliya, but had not been able to substantiate rumours of an explosion. Some might say that Palestinians have an interest in covering up the handiwork of their compatriots, but the confusion in Qalqiliya was mirrored by the prime minister&apos;s office in Jerusalem. When first asked about the explosion, Miri Eisen, the spokeswoman, commented that the explosion of 100kg of TNT would be hard not to notice. After seeking clarification of the exact location of the explosion from Shin Bet, Ms Eisen could only reiterate that the explosion had occurred in Qalqiliya. If it was difficult to find the site of the explosion in Qalqiliya, it was easy to find the identity of the &quot;suicide-terrorist&quot;. Mr Abu Hazar said the suspect was a distant relative and organised a meeting with his father, Yusef Obeid. Mr Obeid said his son, who carried an Israeli identity card, was arrested by the army on March 28, but the family were given no reason for the arrest. Shin Bet specified that the &quot;suicide-terrorist&quot; carried an Israeli identity card and drove an Israeli-licenced vehicle. Ms Eisen said she could not state the name of the suspect but confirmed that he was the only one of the 19 men detained who carried an Israeli identity card. Ali Obeid&apos;s Israeli-registered vehicle is still parked outside his house. It looks freshly painted and completely intact. Shin Bet did not state directly that it was Ali Obeid&apos;s vehicle that carried the explosives to Tel Aviv and later exploded, but other Israeli media did. The statement says that Ali Obeid&apos;s vehicle&apos;s &quot;temporary Israeli licence plates facilitated its use by the Hamas terrorists&quot;. It is possible that Shin Bet have more information, which they are unwilling to share, and that there is a destroyed Israeli-registered commercial vehicle in a devastated area of Qalqiliya somewhere. But why were they so quick to implant a fear in the Israeli public without the details to back it up? Why did the Israeli media fail to demand those details? Ms Eisen explained that the details of the attack were still vague. &quot;We cannot be exact on these things as the investigation is still ongoing.&quot; The investigation continues, and may or may not lead to a trial. The only certain effect of the story is that many Israelis will have their suspicion and fear of Palestinians revived and reinforced.

Abu is suing the international defender for \u00a3140,000 for unpaid agent fees and damages following an alleged fight between the agent and Emanuel Ben Haim, Tal&apos;s father. The case may be complicated by the fact that Abu is an unlicensed agent and cannot represent players according to Uefa rules. Abu is claiming in his writ that he represented Ben Haim in the summer of 2004 and brokered the deal to take him from Maccabi Tel Aviv to Bolton Wanderers for \u00a3149,000. The transfer is believed to be one of the 17 still under examination by Lord Stevens and his Quest team.

He also says he was attacked by Emanuel Ben Haim at the Israel national team&apos;s hotel on the eve of the home game against Croatia in November 2006. The father admits the fight took place but says Abu was to blame for starting it. The player and his father are arguing that Abu led them to believe that he was a licensed agent by showing them fake documents and hiding the fact that he was operating against the rules of football&apos;s governing body. They say that after the contract with Bolton was signed, the player was asked to sign another contract with Jamie Hart, a licensed agent.

While Britain assesses the aftermath of its Iranian hostage crisis, and its diplomats break their embargo on Hamas in a quest for information about Alan Johnston, Israel continues in its efforts to release its missing soldiers. In each case policy makers are forced to face the question of how far they should go to secure the release of captives. Three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped in cross border raids last summer: Gilad Shalit was taken by Hamas-affiliated operatives into Gaza; Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev by Hizbullah into southern Lebanon. This month, Hamas issued a list of 1,400 individuals being held in Israeli jails they wish to see released in return for Gilad Shalit. Having previously declared itself unwilling to negotiate, Israel now says it will consider an exchange, but that at 1,400, the price is too high. A macabre negotiation is now playing itself out. Hamas knows that Israel values the return of its soldiers very highly. The question is, how highly. From Israel&apos;s perspective, the risk is not only that released terrorists may take more lives in the future, but that by negotiating, Israel rewards the captors, and creates an incentive for future hostage taking. The British government was keen to insist two weeks ago that no deal was done to release its servicemen. Some Israeli observers looked enviously at the manner in which Britain was able to resolve the situation. The details of Britain&apos;s dialogue with Iran, and whether or not they truly paid a price, were obscured from view. But Israel does not appear to have the option of doing a deal &quot;under the table&quot;. With negotiation taking place through interlocutors, every hint of progress is being telegraphed to the public through Israeli or Arab media. Even reports that Gilad Shalit had received spectacles provided by his family were front-page news. In the current negotiations over Shalit, the equation does not simply include how many prisoners will be released, but what kind of prisoners. Israeli politicians would prefer to draw the line at those they believe to have &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. The most high-profile example is Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who was convicted on five counts of murder in 2004. Despite being in prison, Barghouti is a key political figure. Even in Israel he is spoken of in optimistic terms as someone who might be able to unify the Palestinian people. In deciding whether or not to free prisoners such as Barghouti, politicians must not only face the families of the captive soldiers, they must also face the families of those killed in the attacks for which the prisoners have been convicted. The dilemmas of course, are not only on the Israeli side. The militants must decide which detainees get a place on their coveted lists, and how many lesser known individuals equal the value of a senior figure like Barghouti. Few would envy the decision makers who must face the choice of who should be spared and at what cost. Israel has long experience in this area. In January 2004, the bodies of three Israeli soldiers who had been ambushed by Hizbullah in 2000 were returned to Israel, along with a reserve Colonel kidnapped in Dubai. They were exchanged for the release of 429 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, and the bodies of 59 Lebanese fighters. Two of the returned prisoners, Sheikh Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, were senior figures in the Shia Lebanese militias. They had been captured by Israel in an attempt to release another captive, Ron Arad, an airman shot down in Lebanon in 1986. Dirani himself had been one of Arad&apos;s captors. Three IDF soldiers captured in the 1982 Lebanon war, but never returned - Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, and Tzvi Feldman - also remain well-known names in Israel. Israeli politicians&apos; preferred position of not negotiating with terrorists cannot withstand the emotional pressure of this issue. The subject has heightened sensitivity in a country where most families have members serving in the army or in the reserves. Everyone knows acutely that it could be their relative, or themselves. Some family members of captive soldiers are household names, regularly interviewed in the Israeli media and doggedly working to keep the issue on the agenda. The most prominent current example is Noam Shalit, the father of Gilad. When Palestinian civilians were killed and injured in an Israeli shelling in Gaza, he went to visit the wounded in a Tel Aviv hospital with a message of peace and reconciliation. He recently offered himself in place of his son as collateral in any exchange deal. Should the crisis be successfully resolved, one can only hope that it will be a gateway, and not a barrier, to wider negotiations. One intriguing statement to emerge from Britain&apos;s crisis in Iran was that &quot;new and interesting lines of communications&quot; had been opened up between the two sides as a result. The late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin said in relation to a prisoner exchange in the 1980s, &quot;[when] we have no military option, it is legitimate to discuss a deal&quot;. Currently, Israel and Hamas are not ready to engage directly with one another, but their mutual interest in a deal is forcing them to negotiate, albeit through third parties. If this kind of pragmatism succeeds in freeing captives, perhaps it could also be applied to the broader peace process.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-20T13:30:00Z", "title": "Macabre negotiations", "sentences": ["When Palestinian civilians were killed and injured in an Israeli shelling in Gaza, he went to visit the wounded in a Tel Aviv hospital with a message of peace and reconciliation."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/20/theprisonersdilemma"}, {"tags": ["World news", "US news", "Gun crime"], "article": "Americans united in a collective day of mourning for the victims of the campus massacre yesterday, with church services and vigils from Capitol Hill to California.

So at three minutes to eight last night, the coach driver pulls into a slip road off the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. We&apos;ve just passed the old Burma Road, used by Jewish forces as a supply route to help break the Arab siege of Jerusalem in the war of 1948. We stand in silence, to the sound of the siren drifting over from nearby Latrun, situated on the 1948 UN-decreed armistice line, a huddle of soldiers and other travellers caught in the blinking orange indicator lights of the coach, paying our respects to the dead. And that&apos;s how I begin this year&apos;s Remembrance Day for Israel&apos;s fallen soldiers, a day I&apos;ve been dreading for weeks. Of course, it&apos;s not that I have a problem with honouring Israel&apos;s dead (in recent years, Remembrance Day has expanded to include those civilians who died in suicide bomb attacks). The dread surfaces because, having experienced this sequence for the first time last year, I know that these coming days amount to a cruel, exhausting psychological operation waged on Israel&apos;s citizens. Today&apos;s remembrance ceremony is immediately followed by Israel&apos;s Independence Day celebrations, creating a roller-coaster ride of emotions, absolute grief followed by absolute joy - and, worst of all, a binding of these two incompatible feelings. If you follow even a small segment of events in Israel on Remembrance Day, you will cry. All day and on all media, the same stories are repeated by mothers, wives, brothers and best friends - recounting in cracked voices and between tears, the loss of loved ones in war, how it happened, how they heard, excruciating tales of handsome young lives crushed to death. On it goes, all day the bodies piling up - and whatever your political analysis of Israel&apos;s position might be, today&apos;s horrendous focus is overwhelming and you cry. Today, there&apos;s also a second air-raid siren marking our remembrance, two minutes and everyone stops and salutes the dead to this creepy soundtrack that every Israeli associates with fear, with a scramble to shelter against impending attack. And here is Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&apos;s message to the bereaved families, in which he says that today is not just a straightforward honouring of the dead. Instead it is a remembrance of &quot;the precious, heavy and painful price which accompanies our struggle for existence as a Jewish, democratic, sovereign and independent country in the Land of Israel&quot;. The government figures count 22,305 dead defending the nation since 1860, when it says Jews first left Jerusalem to start building new settlements beyond it. Since last year&apos;s Remembrance Day, 233 soldiers and security service officials have died. And Olmert continues that, &quot;even today, there are, among our enemies, those who cannot resign themselves to our existence, and seek to destroy the sovereignty of Israel by harming its citizens and soldiers&quot;. Those enemies who make overtures for peace, such as the Arab League with their initiative of 2002, reiterated last month - peace and normalised relations in exchange for Israel&apos;s withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories - are not factored into this assessment. Nor is Syria&apos;s unconditional offer to resume peace negotiations with Israel relevant during these days. Because the eternal national script says that Israel is not the aggressor, but continually strives for, longs for, peace. And it is the enemies of Israel that continually force it to war. And so, as reiterated by Olmert in his message: &quot;During war after war and during routine days, we paid with the blood of the best of our children for all our futures, and for the hope to live in our country in peace.&quot; Death is a national sacrifice. Grief is necessary. War is peace. And this symbiosis is clarified when Remembrance Day segues into celebrations for Independence Day, which starts tonight. And it is not OK to question the inevitability of this logic, that nationhood is insatiably hungry for the blood of Jewish youth. It is not OK to wonder if it is in the hands of Israel - and not its enemies - to change the script. And by this stage nobody is much bothered by these pedantries because the mood has moved from grief to joy and it is such an overwhelming relief. &quot;That&apos;s the sound of independence,&quot; someone jokes, pointing to the hundreds of Israeli flags, raised from so many cars and streets and buildings, flapping noisily in the wind, cheering Israel&apos;s 59th birthday. But according to the national manual for these two, bound-together days, the sound of independence is more likely the ugly roar of war, the guttural cries of human loss, the faint popping of life after precious life being extinguished, sacrificed for the Israeli definition of peace.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-23T19:45:00Z", "title": "The price of freedom", "sentences": ["So at three minutes to eight last night, the coach driver pulls into a slip road off the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/23/thepriceoffreedom"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ehud Olmert"], "article": "Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister showed a &quot;severe failure&quot; in judgment in his rush to embark on the second Lebanon war, according to the findings of the committee of inquiry that were released today. Mr Olmert blindly accepted the recommendations of the army without seeking alternatives before embarking on the war which led to the death of 1,200 Lebanese and 160 Israelis last summer, the report said. The Winograd committee, a panel of five judges, delivered its report to Mr Olmert and other members of the government late this afternoon before releasing it to the public. On receiving his copy, Mr Olmert said that any &quot;failures would be remedied&quot; although he is under intense pressure to take responsibility for his mistakes by resigning. Eliyahu Winograd, the chairman of the committee, told a news conference: &quot;We establish that these decisions and the way they were taken suffered from the most severe failures. We put the responsibility for these failures on the prime minister, the defense minister and the former chief of staff. &quot;If any one of them had acted in a different, better way, the decisions and the way they were made in the period in question, as well as the results of the campaign, would have been different and better.&quot; The committee also attacked Dan Halutz, the then chief of staff, for entering the war unprepared and in an &quot;impulsive manner&quot; and criticised Amir Peretz, the defence minister, for being unaware of the state of the army&apos;s preparedness. The cabinet was also attacked for approving the war without understanding the implications. The crisis was sparked off when Hizbullah fighters ambushed a border patrol on the Lebanon-Israel border on July 12. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed and a further two kidnapped in the initial skirmish, which soon descended into an exchange of rockets into Israel and air attacks on Lebanon. Mr Olmert said that the army would secure the release of Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser and expel Hizbullah from southern Lebanon in the ensuing war but Israeli forces soon discovered a series of deficiencies. Depots of equipment for reservists were depleted and columns of armour entering southern Lebanon were easy targets for Hizbullah fighters armed with anti-tank weapons. The report focused on three individuals who conducted the war, Mr Olmert, Mr Peretz and Mr Halutz. Mr Olmert was criticised for blindly following the suggestion of the army without asking for alternative plans. The prime minister, according to the report, did not assess the readiness of the army to carry out its mission or ask relevant questions before embarking on war. The defence minister was criticised for accepting the post without adequate experience to carry it out and failing to seek expert advice. Most of the blame was levelled at Mr Halutz because he was the only one of the triumvirate with military experience. He was criticised for leading the country to war without offering the government any alternatives. He is also accused of preventing senior officers who disagreed with him from expressing their opinions to the cabinet. The report only deals with the first five days of the war, leaving the committee with much of their work to do. The government will benefit in the short term that much of the criticism has been postponed but it will have live in the shadow of future reports for most of the year. While there have been many calls for Mr Olmert and Mr Peretz to resign, it seems that the majority of the 76 Knesset members who make up the coalition will continue to support the government. Most feel that a change in government could lead to some losing government jobs, and in the event of an election, losing places in the Knesset. Even if Mr Olmert weathers this storm he faces several others in the near future. He is currently being investigated for two property deals in which he made excessive profits that could be seen as indirect bribes. He is also being investigated for improper conduct during his periods as trade minister and finance minister. Key players Ehud Olmert, prime minister Mr Olmert reccently told a French newspaper he felt &quot;indestructible&quot;. But with single-digit approval ratings and fighting a list of scandals, Mr Olmert, 66, is in a difficult position after a year in office. He has fought calls to resign but still faces criticism over the war. He said he wanted to win the return of the two captured Israeli soldiers and dismantle Hizbullah. He failed on both counts. He also denies corruption allegations. Last week, the state auditor recommended a criminal inquiry into a deal Mr Olmert made when he was trade minister. He is also alleged to have profiteered from the sale of at least two properties. Amir Peretz, defence minister Mr Peretz, a former head of Israel&apos;s trade union federation, has perhaps faced the most criticism. He was condemned for becoming defence minister with little military experience, and in his own Labour party for not taking a post that would let him make socio-economic reforms. Mr Peretz, 55, has resisted calls for his resignation but is facing Labour leadership elections. He said if he won he would seek the finance portfolio but polls suggest he will be beaten into third place by the former prime minister Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel&apos;s security services. Mr Peretz has refused to admit any wartime mistakes. Dan Halutz, former chief of staff Mr Halutz, 55, quit in January \u2014 the most senior figure to resign. A former air force commander, he had been chief of staff for a year when the war began. He was criticised for planning an air campaign. On the first day of the war, after the Israelis were captured by Hizbullah, Mr Halutz said his military would target infrastructure and &quot;turn back the clock in Lebanon by 20 years&quot; if they were not freed. He spoke of taking &quot;responsibility&quot; but admitted no mistakes in his handling of the war, although he was critical of some generals. He has since kept a low profile. Eliyahu Winograd, chair of committee Mr Winograd, a retired judge, was not the first choice to head the committee. The job had been given to a former chief of Mossad, Israel&apos;s secret service. Then last September the Israeli government bowed to public pressure to widen the inquiry&apos;s remit and made Mr Winograd, 81, its head. A judge for 24 years, he was president of the Tel Aviv district court and an acting supreme court judge. He has chaired commissions on pension funds, university tuition fees and the fate of the missing Israeli airman Ron Arad.

During the first world war series one of the recruits tells Captain Blackadder he had wanted to see how a war was fought badly, to which the Rowan Atkinson character replies: &quot;Well, you are in the right place then. A war hasn&apos;t been fought this badly since Oluf, king of the Vikings, ordered 1,000 helmets with the horns facing down.&quot; The 150-page interim report (which rather annoyingly contains no executive summary) describes a litany of mistakes leading up to and during the war, from logistics and planning, to preparedness, strategy and lack of options considered. The report is interim because it ends at day six of the war (in the good old days, they only used to last that long), with the final document, up to and including day 34, due in the summer. There is plenty of blame to go around and it is doled out in generous helpings to virtually every part of Israel&apos;s political and military establishment. Prime minister Olmert&apos;s management of the war is described as a &quot;severe failure&quot; and the media in Israel will discuss little else in the coming days. Here are five comments that try to look beyond the immediate speculation. First, the report is mainly about better wars, not fewer wars. Israel&apos;s elected leadership and its military have the duty to protect and defend the Israeli public. The Hezbollah raid across the border that ignited the conflict was an unprovoked act of aggression, but the ongoing political context of unresolved conflict should not be ignored. The vast majority of the public debate in Israel during and since the second Lebanon war has been about the failure to win wars, rather than the failure to avoid war and make peace. There was no committee of inquiry established to investigate the wasted five years since the Arab League launched its peace initiative in 2002 or the wasted year from Abu Mazen&apos;s election to the Palestinian presidency until the Hamas parliamentary election. And there is unlikely to be an investigatory commission into Israel&apos;s failure to respond intelligently to the opportunities presented by the Mecca-Palestinian unity government deal and the prospect it holds out for a comprehensive ceasefire. This is unfortunate. Israel&apos;s military is undoubtedly in need of a spring-cleaning, and it would be a healthy thing if the Israeli public&apos;s confidence in the military would be restored (preferably without the need for another war), but the real collection of cobwebs that needs dusting off is from the file entitled &quot;Israel&apos;s diplomatic strategy&quot;. Second, there are a few specific findings worth focusing on. The report does point out that Israel&apos;s military preparedness has suffered as a result of its ongoing role in the Palestinian territories: while the country&apos;s military is very practiced in occupation, it is ill-prepared for challenging, mobile warfare. Training schedules, logistical arrangements, reserve exercises and, most of all, the military mindset, have all become intifada-centric. In a book released just days before the committee report two top military correspondents concluded from their exhaustive research that the army&apos;s weak performance was, more than anything else, a consequence of years invested in suppressing the Palestinian intifada. The current generation of officers has military skills honed almost entirely during skirmishes in the territories. One could only hope that, among the myriad lessons Israel will be learning, the most obvious one will not be lost: end the occupation. The report, to its credit (and from what I&apos;ve read so far, it is a serious document), does also question the limited use made of diplomatic and political efforts before and during the war, and the lack of a planned exit strategy. Third, Olmert is betting on public apathy. The key question gripping Israel today is whether prime minister Olmert can survive the criticism leveled at him by the report, especially as it follows a number of investigations being conducted with regard to his own personal probity and record-low approval ratings. Most of the Israeli media will be conducting a mini-war campaign of their own against Olmert. He was never liked by the media, all policies aside, and is considered difficult and arrogant. The rightwing opposition, led by Benyamin Netanyahu, will try to push for new elections, a move also supported by the leftwing Meretz. Lacking a parliamentary majority, their effort will focus on public pressure - and this is where Olmert can play his trump card: the glorious and unshakable apathy of the Israeli public. There will be a rally in Tel Aviv square this coming Thursday night, which will call on Olmert to resign. The square will be crowded, but it is very unlikely that public momentum will be sustainable after that. In this respect, the Israeli public at least has &quot;equal opportunity apathy&quot;: whether it is a botched war or a botched peace, the people stay at home. Fourth: if Olmert is finished, what are the political options? The safe money is on Olmert riding this out. Too many in the current Knesset will lose from early elections. If Olmert battles on - and he has already stated that this is his intention - then he might even seek to re-launch his premiership with some bold diplomacy. Within the next month, Olmert is likely to be in a position to appoint a new finance minister and a new defense minister and, with a reshuffled cabinet, new policies may emerge. But if Olmert is a condemned man, then there are three alternative scenarios, in decreasing order of likelihood. The governing Kadima party may come to see its salvation in jettisoning its leader and selecting a new prime minister from within its own ranks. Israel would then have a new prime minister and possibly a new coalition, if some parties bolt and others are added, without going to new elections. The name mentioned most often in this respect is foreign minister Tzipi Livni, but reaching a consensus will not be easy. The next option is for a consensus to emerge around new elections. This will be the call of the opposition&apos;s demonstrations and if Kadima implodes (as it just might), and a new Labour party leader to be elected in a month is feeling bullish, then it will indeed be off to the ballot box. The last option would be for at least a dozen parliamentarians from the combined Kadima-Pensioners faction to break away and defect to the opposition, thereby presenting Netanyahu with a rightwing/religious majority to lead, without new elections. Jolly days ahead. The fifth and final comment is this: beware an army with wounded pride. This is perhaps the most worrying consequence of last summer&apos;s war and the attendant report published today. There is a clear and frequently articulated sense that Israel&apos;s military standing has been damaged and that only an unequivocal military success can restore both the army&apos;s deterrence value and its wounded pride. Deterrence is not something to be sneezed at. But Israel has not gone from being the neighborhood 800-pound gorilla to its emaciated weakling overnight, and the region is well aware of that. Finding an opportunity for the military to prove itself again would be a very dangerous and self-defeating goal for Israel to adopt. Currently, it is Gaza that lies in the potential firing line, but it could be Lebanon again, or even Syria. The challenge for Israel and the region, but also for the US and the international community will be to avoid turning today&apos;s publication on the last war into a countdown for the next.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-30T22:00:00Z", "title": "Five for fighting", "sentences": ["There will be a rally in Tel Aviv square this coming Thursday night, which will call on Olmert to resign."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/30/fivecomments"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "Perhaps they should play England&apos;s remaining home Euro 2008 qualifiers in Oxford. Certainly Steve McClaren must have struggled to identify the strange noise that greeted his introduction here as part of Peter Rhoades-Brown&apos;s testimonial Oxford XI. Steve, it&apos;s called applause. It means they like you. And, a couple of isolated boos apart, they certainly seemed to.  McClaren appeared alongside a selection of other famous former Oxford players, including Rhoades-Brown himself, who is now the club&apos;s community officer. The England manager seemed unusually happy with life too, at least while he was signing shirts with his big left-handed &quot;Steve&quot; outside the ground. Warming up before kick-off he looked like what, in another guise, he is: someone&apos;s dad playing football.  The England manager was 27 and at Oxford when a back injury led to his retirement as a player. Descriptions of McClaren in his prime usually refer to a &quot;cultured&quot; midfielder. Here he looked closer to thoughtful, ponderous even. Ronaldinho is said to play with a smile on his face. McClaren does everything with a smile on his face, although by the end of his brief appearance it had become more of a grimace.  The England manager took the No8 shirt against a youthful Chelsea XI. The opening minutes were spent waddling around purposefully in the holding role. Would he be able to dovetail effectively with his midfield partner Jim Magilton? Apparently so, judging by one early scuttle forward, accompanied by a frenzied burst of pointing. Frank? Stevie? That&apos;s how you do it.  At times it was a typically cagey McClaren performance. His first touch was a back-pass. His second saw him fall flat on his face attempting a square ball to his left-winger. A diving - or rather toppling over slowly - header received raucous cheers. That was about as good as it got. Before long, like an unhappy goldfish, the England manager could muster only a listless circuit of the centre of the pitch.  The rest of the game was pretty much Chelsea attack versus Oxford defence, with the visitors eventually winning 4-2. The Israeli Ben Sahar was sprightly, as he had been against McClaren&apos;s England in Tel Aviv. The pacy winger Scott Sinclair looked like a jetski slaloming between the rusting hulks of Oxford&apos;s defence, particularly during one groovy early shuffle that left the England manager in his wake.  McClaren is famous for what he did after he left Oxford. The crowd were more interested in the likes of their former striker George Lawrence, who exuded a looming menace during his 10 minutes on the pitch. But there was a certain protectiveness in the applause as the No8 trudged off after 20 minutes. McClaren gave a prim but heartfelt little clap back towards the main stand. He looked, it has to be said, completely knackered. This was apparently the first time any England manager has taken part in such a high-profile match. By the look on his face, it may be a while before it happens again.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-01T00:28:43Z", "title": "McClaren shows England's midfield how it's done", "sentences": ["The Israeli Ben Sahar was sprightly, as he had been against McClaren&apos;s England in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/01/newsstory.sport8"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, faced his most serious crisis in office yesterday after a government inquiry held him responsible for &quot;very serious failings&quot; over last year&apos;s war in Lebanon. The criticisms published by the Winograd commission went further than most had expected and singled out for scathing blame Mr Olmert; his defence minister, Amir Peretz, and Dan Halutz, the then chief of staff who quit his post earlier this year. The prime minister bore &quot;supreme and comprehensive responsibility&quot; for the decisions of his government and army, the commission ruled. It listed his mistakes and said: &quot;All of these add up to a serious failure in exercising judgment, responsibility and prudence.&quot; Last night Mr Olmert showed no sign of resigning. He leads a coalition that retains a large majority in the Knesset but is rapidly losing popularity in the country. However, several MPs outside the coalition from both the right and the left called on Mr Olmert to resign. &quot;The report leads to just one conclusion: the failed government no longer has moral validity to rule,&quot; said Gideon Sa&apos;ar, a senior MP from the rightwing Likud party, which is ahead in opinion polls. Demonstrations against the government are planned, culminating in a large rally in Tel Aviv on Thursday. The five-member commission, chaired by a retired judge, focused in this 171-page interim report on the background to the war and its first five days. It reserved some of its most trenchant criticism for the prime minister&apos;s decision to launch the war after the capture by Hizbullah fighters of two Israeli soldiers on July 12. He made up his mind &quot;hastily&quot;, even though there was no detailed military plan before him, it said. He failed to consult others or to take into account colleagues&apos; reservations. He did not clearly set out the aims of the war, and the proposed goals were &quot;not feasible&quot;. However, it stopped short of calling on him to resign. Mr Olmert was handed a copy of the report an hour before it was published and said he would &quot;act immediately&quot; and &quot;correct failures&quot;. Last night he held a meeting of his Kadima party to discuss the report. The cabinet secretary, Yisrael Maimon, told Israel Radio last night: &quot;The prime minister is not considering resignation.&quot; Yet these findings follow a number of scandals linked to Mr Olmert and others in his government. In an opinion poll commissioned by the newspaper Ma&apos;ariv before the Winograd report was published, 74% thought Mr Olmert should resign. Even if he survives these criticisms, he can expect more to follow in a second, more substantial Winograd report about the later stages of the Lebanon war, due to be published in July. More than 1,000 Lebanese and 158 Israelis were killed in the 34-day war. In a summary of the inquiry, the commission made no comment about the death toll or destruction in Lebanon but focused on Israel&apos;s failure to achieve its stated goals. The two captured soldiers have not been freed and Hizbullah remains a powerful armed force. Israeli intelligence believes it has restocked its arsenal since the war. The commission highlighted several broad failures, particularly the lack of a detailed military plan. The army should have noted that there was a &quot;limited&quot; chance of achieving significant military gains and that the only way to stop the barrage of Hizbullah rockets - up to 200 a day - was a long, unpopular, ground operation to capture areas of southern Lebanon. It also found that there was &quot;ambiguity&quot; in presenting the goals to get ministers on board, even if they had differences about the value of an intensive campaign. The military also failed to mobilise its reserves early enough and was guilty of a much deeper lack of training and readiness. &quot;The IDF [Israel Defence Force] was not ready for this war,&quot; it said. Mr Peretz, the defence minister, lacked military, political and governmental knowledge and experience, and &quot;failed in fulfilling his functions&quot;, the report said. Gen Halutz acted &quot;impulsively,&quot; and &quot;exhibited flaws in professionalism, responsibility and judgment&quot;. Eliyahu Winograd, inquiry chairman, said: &quot;If any one of those had acted better, the decisions and the results of the war would have been different and better.&quot; Main players Ehud Olmert, prime minister Last month, Mr Olmert told a French newspaper he felt &quot;indestructible&quot;. But with single-digit approval ratings and fighting a list of scandals, Mr Olmert, 66, is in a difficult position after a year in office. He has fought calls to resign but still faces criticism over the war. He said he wanted to win the return of the two captured Israeli soldiers and dismantle Hizbullah. He failed on both counts. He also denies corruption allegations. Last week, the state auditor recommended a criminal inquiry into a deal Mr Olmert made when he was trade minister. He is also alleged to have profiteered from the sale of at least two properties. Amir Peretz, defence minister Mr Peretz, a former head of Israel&apos;s trade union federation, has perhaps faced the most criticism. He was condemned for becoming defence minister with little military experience, and in his own Labour party for not taking a post that would let him make socio-economic reforms. Mr Peretz, 55, has resisted calls for his resignation but is facing Labour leadership elections. He said if he won he would seek the finance portfolio but polls suggest he will be beaten into third place by the former prime minister Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel&apos;s security services. Mr Peretz has refused to admit any wartime mistakes. Dan Halutz, former chief of staff Gen Halutz, 55, quit in January - the most senior figure to resign. A former air force commander, he had been chief of staff for a year when the war began. He was criticised for planning an air campaign. On the first day of the war, after the Israelis were captured by Hizbullah, Gen Halutz said his military would target infrastructure and &quot;turn back the clock in Lebanon by 20 years&quot; if they were not freed. He spoke of taking &quot;responsibility&quot; but admitted no mistakes in his handling of the war, although he was critical of some generals. He has since kept a low profile. Eliyahu Winograd, chair of committee Mr Winograd, a retired judge, was not the first choice to head the committee. The job had been given to a former chief of Mossad, Israel&apos;s secret service. Then last September the Israeli government bowed to public pressure to widen the inquiry&apos;s remit and made Mr Winograd, 81, its head. A judge for 24 years, he was president of the Tel Aviv district court and an acting supreme court judge. He has chaired commissions on pension funds, university tuition fees and the fate of the missing Israeli airman Ron Arad. His five committee members were chosen by Mr Olmert and his cabinet.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-01T07:23:06Z", "title": "Israeli PM refuses to resign over Lebanon war", "sentences": ["Demonstrations against the government are planned, culminating in a large rally in Tel Aviv on Thursday.", "A judge for 24 years, he was president of the Tel Aviv district court and an acting supreme court judge."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/01/syria.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ehud Olmert"], "article": "A member of the Israeli cabinet today resigned in protest at the handling of the Lebanon war, increasing the political pressure on the prime minister, Ehud Olmert.

He must bear responsibility. I can no longer sit in a government led by Ehud Olmert.&quot; Mr Cabel&apos;s resignation follows inquiry findings published yesterday into the Lebanon war that harshly criticised the prime minister and his defence minister, Amir Peretz from Labour, as well as the army chief, Dan Halutz, who had already quit. Mr Olmert, who heads the centrist Kadima party, said he would not resign, insisting he was the best man to put things right. &quot;It would not be right to quit and I have no intention of doing so,&quot; Mr Olmert told Israelis in a short televised address yesterday, hours after the country watched the inquiry head, former supreme court judge Eliyahu Winograd, read out scathing criticism of Mr Olmert&apos;s conduct of the war.  The panel said the government had rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but Mr Olmert bore &quot;supreme responsibility&quot; for launching the air, sea and land offensive without a proper plan after Hizbullah seized two Israeli soldiers on July 12.

Although Eitan Cabel, a Labour party minister without portfolio, was not a leading figure, his departure yesterday morning was the first public sign of internal divisions within the ruling coalition. On Monday, an interim report from the government-appointed Winograd committee into the opening days of the war said Mr Olmert showed a &quot;serious failure in judgment, responsibility and prudence&quot;. The prime minister woke to newspaper headlines yesterday that underlined in no uncertain terms his stark unpopularity: &quot;He needs to go,&quot; said Yedioth Ahronoth; &quot;Olmert on his way out,&quot; said Ma&apos;ariv; &quot;Not fit for the next war,&quot; said Ha&apos;aretz. A snap opinion poll by Israel Radio said 69% of the country wanted the prime minister to resign immediately. &quot;Can this government headed by Ehud Olmert lead the nation in the next war - which according to intelligence estimates could take place - and win? The conclusion drawn from the inquiry&apos;s report is a clear no, and therefore this government must step down ...&quot; wrote Ze&apos;ev Schiff, a veteran military analyst. &quot;The bottom line is that Ehud Olmert needs to go,&quot; wrote Nahum Barnea, one of Israel&apos;s most respected columnists. &quot;Not because of the failings of the war, but because if after a report like that, from a committee like that, a committee whose members he chose ... Olmert continues to serve, there will probably never be any personal accountability here.&quot; Mr Olmert insisted he will stay in office and has argued through his aides that though he made mistakes he should remain in power to correct them. A demonstration against him is planned in Tel Aviv tomorrow, but, given a strong economy and voter apathy, it is not clear if there is enough discontent to force him out. There is also a broader unease in the five-party coalition government about unseating the prime minister. Before the latest resignation, Mr Olmert&apos;s Kadima party led a coalition that controlled 78 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Polls show an early election would topple the coalition and bring back to power the right-wing Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu. The coalition is also vulnerable to internal splits. Labour MPs called on the prime minister to quit, including Ami Ayalon, one of two people tipped to become the Labour leader after elections this month.

What we are left with today, sigh the nostalgics, are the wimps of Zion - like Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defence Minister Amir Peretz and former military chief of staff Dan Halutz. These are the ignominious stars of this week&apos;s report from the inquiry commission headed by retired judge Eliayahu Winograd, which savaged them for blundering into an unnecessary war in Lebanon last summer, and for then bungling the conflict by failing to set, never mind achieve, any credible objectives.Yet, after several days of ignoring howls for his resignation and a popularity rating that touched zero (or even minus digits, because of the polls&apos; plus-minus margin of error), Olmert seems to have weathered the storm for the moment. Today the aftershocks of Winograd&apos;s earthquake moved on to the Knesset, where neither Olmert nor Peretz appeared for the political debate, and later to Tel Aviv&apos;s famous Rabin Square, where the noisy leftists, artists, and bereaved families were expected to mass in their tens of thousands to proclaim a collective &quot;we told you so&quot; and to add palpable volume to the demands to throw out the culprits, whose 34 days of military incompetence last July cost the lives of an estimated 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, 119 Israeli soldiers, and 39 civilians killed by Hizbullah rocket attacks into Israel. What has slipped the attention of most commentators on the Winograd Report is the adjective &quot;interim,&quot; which is what it is - a fuller, more detailed report is expected from the commission in August. This fine print appears now to be Olmert&apos;s interim escape clause.  One Hebrew newspaper cartoon showed Winograd saying to his panel, &quot;we won&apos;t call on Olmert to resign; let&apos;s leave it up to him to make the right decision.&quot; Most experts expect the final Winograd document to rectify that and to recommend the resignation of all those responsible for the debacle of the second Lebanon war.  This interim report may paint Olmert as a failure, but it also unwittingly handed him a mission, which he has been quick to seize as the reason for his refusal to step down. As a responsible leader, he must not run, but must stay to implement Winograd&apos;s recommendations - &quot;we made the mess, and we will clean it up,&quot; he told his cabinet. Olmert may be an incompetent and unpopular leader, but he remains a wily politician.He also got a breather from the rampaging press yesterday as the media turned their collective ire on their former darling, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. She had been expected to announce on Wednesday that she would resign and challenge Olmert for the leadership. She was widely assumed to hold the fate of the government and the prime minister in her hands, and the media were baying for a feisty, female heroine of the day. What they got instead was another wimp of Zion who virtually announced in a convoluted statement that she preferred the comfort of the ministerial seat to the exciting call of the political wild. Her capitulation effectively headed off any serious revolt in Olmert&apos;s Kadima party for the present. The parliamentary Knesset debate on Winograd today also turned inward to opportunism and posturing. Former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu could not conceal his glee at the opportunity to lambast Olmert and position himself for another stab at the job that he also bungled first time around. The Winograd report may fade soon from international headlines, but its reverberations will echo for a long time through future Middle East news. It is undoubtedly one of the most significant indictments of the Israeli political and military establishment since the Kahan Commission report on the first Lebanon war in 1982, after the Israeli military failed to stop the Lebanese Christian militia massacre of Palestinians at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Next month will mark 40 years since Israel&apos;s stunning and historic total victory in the 1967 Six Day War against its Arab enemies. The anniversary could well be marked by somber readings from the 2007 Winograd report as the country ponders, not how far it has advanced since then, but how far and how rapidly its regional strategic might has been slipping from its grasp. In refusing to resign, Olmert, adopting the mantle of rectifier, said &quot;lessons will be learned&quot; from the Winograd report&apos;s findings. However, the most important lessons may already have been learned outside Israel&apos;s borders - the main one being that the era of the invincible Israel has finally passed. When Winograd was made public last Sunday, the news event ran live and in Hebrew on Hizbullah&apos;s Al-Manar television channel in Beirut, accompanied by informed and gleeful commentary in Arabic. &quot;The report ... reveals the weaknesses of those who thought they couldn&apos;t be beaten,&quot; said Sheikh Hassan Ezzeddine, a senior Hizbullah political official. &quot;It proves what we said all along - that this is an enemy that can be defeated.&quot;  Ray Hanania, a well-known Palestinian American columnist and stand-up comic, relates an apocryphal conversation with his dad when he was a young lad. &quot;Being an Arab, son, you are going to get your butt kicked repeatedly - by the Jews. And, worse. They will do it in less than six days. Real humiliation.&quot;  &quot;Wow, that was bad news,&quot; says Hanania, &quot;but then I asked if there was good news.&quot;  &quot;Well,&quot; said dad, &quot;the good news is that when the Jews kick your butt and it takes them longer than six days to do it, you&apos;re going to feel like you won.&quot; Winograd&apos;s assessment of Israel&apos;s 34 disastrous days in Lebanon last summer has left a number of people feeling like they won. This time, there are few Israelis among them.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-03T18:00:22Z", "title": "Wimps of Zion", "sentences": ["Today the aftershocks of Winograd&apos;s earthquake moved on to the Knesset, where neither Olmert nor Peretz appeared for the political debate, and later to Tel Aviv&apos;s famous Rabin Square, where the noisy leftists, artists, and bereaved families were expected to mass in their tens of thousands to proclaim a collective &quot;we told you so&quot; and to add palpable volume to the demands to throw out the culprits, whose 34 days of military incompetence last July cost the lives of an estimated 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, 119 Israeli soldiers, and 39 civilians killed by Hizbullah rocket attacks into Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/03/wimpsofzion"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The following correction was made to this article on Wednesday May 9 2007   Tai Geva&apos;s name was mistakenly omitted from underneath the second quote at the end of the online version of this article, leading to his words being attributed wrongly to Asaf Pasternak. This has been corrected.    Tens of thousands of Israelis gathered at a mass rally in Tel Aviv last night to call for the resignation of the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, over his failings in last year&apos;s war in Lebanon. Although the rally served to highlight Mr Olmert&apos;s deepening unpopularity, the prime minister appears to have weathered, at least for now, the worst of the storm that followed a highly critical report from the government-appointed Winograd commission into the war. Last night&apos;s rally, in Rabin Square - scene of the assassination in 1995 of the then prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin - was a demonstration of the deep frustration and anger many Israelis feel at the conduct of their government, both in last year&apos;s war and in a series of scandals involving accusations ranging from rape allegations levelled against the president, Moshe Katsav, to corruption. Mr Olmert&apos;s popularity ratings have been in single figures. Opinion polls this week suggest three-quarters of the population want him to resign. Among those gathered in Tel Aviv last night were reservist soldiers who fought in the war, relatives of some of those who died, and an array of critics of the government from the left and right wing. Ofer Winestok, 25, a student who voted for the Labour party in the last election and served in the infantry in the Lebanon war, said: &quot;There was no leadership in this war. I saw how it was and they just reacted to what happened. The orders changed every few minutes; nobody knew what has happening or what were the targets.&quot; He wore a T-shirt bearing a photograph of his cousin Guy Hasom, 24, an infantry soldier killed on the last day of the war. &quot;The government needs to resign. They&apos;re not qualified to do their jobs,&quot; he said. The rally alone is unlikely to be enough to unseat Mr Olmert and his coalition government but it offered echoes of previous demonstrations of Israeli street power. Protests in 1974, after the Yom Kippur war, eventually brought the resignation of the prime minister, Golda Meir. Tens of thousands gathered in the square in 1982 to protest against the invasion of Lebanon. Malcolm Dash, 69, who fought in the Yom Kippur war, said: &quot;Our government has failed, completely and utterly, and there is no room left for them. They have no plan or programme, and all they are doing is looking after their own seats. In any other nation they would have resigned by now.&quot; He said the capture of the two Israeli soldiers on July 12, which triggered last year&apos;s war, had needed a response but not a 34-day conflict. &quot;They took us into a war when it should have been a reprisal.&quot; But Mr Dash admitted that such protests were unlikely to topple the government. Mr Olmert&apos;s real battle for power took place among his Kadima party colleagues. Most of the 29 Kadima MPs have now sided with him, despite Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister, calling on Mr Olmert to resign on Wednesday. She refused to step down herself and failed to gather a momentum of support within the party. Yesterday she was given harsh treatment in the Israeli press and was described uncharitably in the Yedioth Ahronoth as &quot;all-talk Tzipi&quot;. Ma&apos;ariv, another paper, called it &quot;her smallest hour&quot;. Ms Livni, who has been regarded for many months as the best candidate within the party for the premiership, may have damaged her political career. Some of Mr Olmert&apos;s aides have called for her to be sacked and suggested her departure would come, if not now, then in a reshuffle soon. Although she has distanced herself from those most criticised for the conduct of the war, Ms Livni is widely seen by Israeli analysts as having been too cautious to seize the opportunity of bringing the party with her when she called for the prime minister&apos;s resignation. Mr Olmert argues that he should remain in office to correct mistakes he admits he made in the war. The Winograd commission, which investigated the government&apos;s handling of the war, issued a damning litany of &quot;very serious failings&quot;. However, Mr Olmert is still in a weak position. Party leadership elections within Labour, his coalition partner, are due this month. A new leader might pull Labour out of the coalition. Even if Mr Olmert survives that disruption, he can expect more scathing criticisms in July or August when the Winograd inquiry reports on the later stages of the war.

Back in 1978, I was one of the organisers of the first Peace Now demonstration in what was at the time still called Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square after the assassination). Before the Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat had made peace a tangible possibility, a &quot;large&quot; Israeli peace demonstration meant a maximum of 500 people. Back in March, 1978, the organisers were astounded when 40,000 people came to demonstrate in favour of a positive response to Sadat&apos;s initiative. &quot;Who are all these people?&quot; asked later-to-be MK Dedi Zucker, who had never spoken before more than 100 people before, and felt a bit of stage fright. I have always felt a strong sense of identification with the peace and Rabin memorial demonstrations that I have gone to in the square. Not so last night, when I went more as a form of anthopological/journalistic exercise. Last night&apos;s demonstration was held under the slogan &quot;Failures Go Home!&quot; and aimed at the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the defence minister, Amir Peretz. The dilemma about the demonstration was reflected by two parallel columns on the front page of today&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz. One, pro, was headlined &quot;Present: Remember May 3rd&quot;, written by Ari Shavit. The other, anti, was headlined &quot;Absent: The Wrong Demonstration&quot;, written by Ehud Asheri. Shavit is one of the many Israelis who have been on a crusade since the end of the Lebanon war last summer, blaming Olmert and Peretz for many of the ills of Israeli society. He considers last night&apos;s demonstration to be a popular mandate for resignation, come what may. Asheri, who did not attend the demonstration, wrote that people who talk about the failure of leadership this past summer are &quot;really yearning for a victorious leader to restore their lost pride&quot;. What the demonstration should have been about was a call for &quot;a bold diplomatic initiative&quot; for peace. I&apos;m with Asheri, which is why I went to last night&apos;s demonstration as an observer, and not as a participant. Unfortunately, the Israeli internal political chaos is happening precisely at a moment when there are signs of possible movement on the diplomatic front, what is called around here a &quot;window of opportunity&quot;. We have Syrian calls for talks, we have an Arab reaffirmation of the 2002 Arab League Initiative which calls for peace between Israel and the entire Arab world based upon an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders, the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel and an agreed upon solution to the refugee problem, and we even have the bumbling and slumbering American giant insisting on bi-monthly meetings between the Israeli prime minister and Palestinian president, with a clearly formulated document of &quot;benchmarks&quot; for forward progress. But all is not lost. On my way to the demonstration I spent five hours at Tel Aviv University within the framework of what is called the Israeli Peace NGO forum, a coalition of more than 100 Israeli civil society organisations. The topic of discussion was an Israeli-Palestinian-European civil society conference for Israeli-Palestinian peace to be held in Italy this June. And also in June, there will be an Israeli-Palestinian-International civil society conference in Amman, Jordan, devoted to &quot;Promoting Peace Through Dialogue&quot;.

Shooting from a low angle, the photographer David Rubinger framed their faces against the wall. His picture quickly becoming a defining image of the conflict. Here, the photographer and the three paratroopers recall the moment history was made before other eyewitnesses summon up remembrance of the war. The Israeli paratroopersZion Karasenti, Yitzak Yifat and Haim Oshri Born in Tiberias, Zion Karasenti, 64, fought at Ammunition Hill in the advance on East Jerusalem. He is a director and choreographer and lives in Afula Everyone in the area had been called up and I felt left out. I was impatient to go. Eventually the truck came for me. My mother cried, but I felt I had to do something for my country. At Ammunition Hill, all we could see was a hill surrounded by trenches and barbed wire. When we started to move, they threw everything they had at us. We got through one fence and found more wire. I threw myself on it and acted as a bridge for everyone else. I felt no pain. We got into the trenches, which were shallow and narrow. When someone was injured we passed them down the line over our bodies. The Jordanians couldn&apos;t get away, but they kept on fighting to the last man. I was the first paratrooper to get to the Wailing Wall. I didn&apos;t know where I was, but I saw a female Israeli soldier, so I asked &apos;Where am I?&apos; and she said: &apos;The Wailing Wall.&apos; She gave me a postcard and told me to write to my parents before she disappeared. It might have been a dream, but then many years later I met the woman. She had been in the postal corps. As more soldiers arrived, a photographer told us to stand like this and look in this direction. I just did it - I didn&apos;t even think about it. When I think of all the soldiers that died to take Jerusalem, I wonder if they would have thought it was worth it. I think they would. Yitzak Yifat, 64, is an obstetrics and gynaecology surgeon. He was 24, and living in Tel Aviv, when the war broke out. He was involved in the battle for Ammunition Hill and the conquest of East Jerusalem I developed toothache when we arrived in Jerusalem and went into battle with my mouth still numb from the local anaesthetic. It was face-to-face fighting. I fought like a tiger. My friend was shot in the backside and he was about to be shot again by a Jordanian. I shot him. Another Jordanian saw I was out of bullets and he charged at me with a bayonet. I don&apos;t know how I did it, but I took his gun and shot him with it. It was brutal, and a sad victory. I lost many friends. After the fighting we built a memorial to our friends - and one to the Jordanians, in honour of their bravery. Entering the Old City wasn&apos;t such a big deal to me as it was to some. I wonder now if it was all worth it: it seems so complicated and our leaders have no vision for the future. I am glad we liberated Jerusalem and it should remain united under our sovereignty, but everyone, from any religion, should be allowed to visit. I&apos;m angry about what the religious [Orthodox] have done to the Western Wall, dividing it between the sexes and imposing their rules on it. Once I was in New York, in 1986, and a woman came up to me. She had numbers tattooed on her wrist, so she&apos;d survived the concentration camps, and she asked if I was the boy in the photograph at the Western Wall. Born in Yemen in 1944, Haim Oshri emigrated to Israel in 1949 and finished military service in 1965. In the battle for Jerusalem&apos;s Ammunition Hill, his paratrooper regiment lost 37 out of 150 soldiers. An Orthodox Jew, he feels the conquest of Jerusalem had a religious significance and that the Old City should remain part of Israel in the event of a peace agreement The battle for Ammunition Hill was the worst moment of the war. There wasn&apos;t a plan - we were just told to attack. The Jordanians were brave soldiers. Now it makes me angry to think of all the unnecessary casualties. If we had taken more time to plan, there would have been far fewer casualties. As an Orthodox Jew it was special for me to be involved in the fight for Jerusalem. It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re from Poland or Yemen, Jerusalem is our common bond. Every day we pray three times to Jerusalem, and I could never have imagined the magic of seeing the Kotel [Western Wall] for the first time. Rubinger directed the picture. He told us to look up and he lay down while taking it. It was just good luck I was there at that historical time and that I was in the picture. It&apos;s a big honour. The photographerDavid Rubinger Born in Vienna in 1924, David Rubinger emigrated to Palestine in 1939 and became a photographer. He fought in the Israeli army in 1948, but by 1967 he was working for Life magazine, covering Israel&apos;s invasion of the Sinai. When he realised Israel planned to attack Jerusalem he rushed back, arriving at the Western Wall in time to take the first photos of Israeli soldiers at Judaism&apos;s holiest site. His shot of three paratroopers staring at the wall is one of the best known in Israel&apos;s history I served with the British army during the Second World War. In 1948 I was a platoon commander around Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem, but I was normally in trenches or fortified positions. Life was more dangerous for my wife, who had to go out and queue for food and water. Things began to heat up in May 1967 and I went to join the Israeli forces in the Negev. A few days before war broke out everything seemed to go quiet. I had dinner in Tel Aviv with a colleague, Paul Schutzer from Life magazine. We bet a bottle of champagne on who would get the first cover photograph. The war broke out on the Monday and Paul was killed the same day. I was with the Israeli forces that went into the Sinai. Just after the battle for El Arish, I overheard radio messages that something was going to happen in Jerusalem. A helicopter was taking away the wounded so I squeezed on. I didn&apos;t know where it was going, but it landed in Beersheva, where I&apos;d parked my car. I was exhausted. I never trust anyone to drive my car, but I picked up a soldier who was hitchhiking and got him to drive while I slept. We arrived at 6am in Jerusalem and I went straight to see my family. I found out that Jerusalem had been taken and I headed for the Old City.I didn&apos;t have any great feeling for Jerusalem, I just wanted to be the first with the photographs. There was still some sniping going on but the fighting was over. When I got there, it was very emotional. Everyone around me was crying. I think there was such euphoria because in the weeks before the war there was a sense of doom. The national stadium was prepared for 40,000 graves and even if we thought we might win, it would be a costly victory. The humour before the war was very dark. &apos;Would the last person to leave please turn out the lights.&apos; We went from being doomed to having an empire. It was like a condemned man with the noose around his neck suddenly being told that not only was he going to live he was going to be the king. The nation went a little nuts. For the religious, the victory had to be God-given and that is how the whole Jewish messianic and settler movement was born. I lay down to take the picture of the paratroopers because there was barely three metres between the Wailing Wall and the houses next to it. When I developed the film, I didn&apos;t think much of the picture. I gave it to the army. They passed it on to the government press office which then distributed it to everyone for virtually nothing. I still don&apos;t think it&apos;s a great picture, but often iconic pictures are created by the media and what people read into them. The Palestinian schoolboyNazmi Al Jubeh Nazmi Al Jubeh, 52, is director of a Ramallah-based organisation that conserves Palestinian heritage. He was 12 at the time of the Six-Day War and was infected by the optimism that Egypt&apos;s President Nasser was going to re-assert Arab pride by defeating Israel and enabling the refugees to return to their homes in Israel. The war led Al Jubeh to join left-wing Palestinian groups. He still believes in a Palestinian state on the land that Israel conquered in 1967 I was born in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, but we moved just outside the walls in 1966. I was the sixth of 11 children. My father&apos;s shop was in the middle of the Old City. I went to school next to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and spent every day criss-crossing the Maghrebi Quarter. I still remember the faces, the smells of spicy food and the special clothes that came from North Africa. The years 1965-67 saw the emergence of Nasserism. It was forbidden to listen to the Voice of Cairo radio station in Jordan so I acted as a lookout for my brothers to check the Jordanian police did not come near the house. There were a lot of refugees in the Old City and they were in a very bad situation. They were ready to go back to their homes in West Jerusalem and other areas at any moment. They wanted to believe that Nasser would solve everything for them. If there was war there could only be one result. We knew nothing of Israel. We couldn&apos;t even see it. I remember throwing stones over the barriers near the Damascus Gate and Israelis throwing stones back at us, but the enemy was faceless; it was seen as an inhuman force which threw people out of their homes. No one expected war to happen so quickly. There were no rumours, no obvious preparation, even in the Jordanian military camp. It was not until the second day of the war that Jordan distributed guns to civilians in the Old City. From the garden of our home in Silwan, I could see the battle for Government House [the UN headquarters in no man&apos;s land]. There was shelling and bombing around our house, so our whole family went to my grandfather&apos;s house in the Jewish Quarter. My grandfather didn&apos;t allow anyone to leave, but from his roof I saw what we thought were Iraqi tanks driving down the Mount of Olives to our east. Soon after, we heard the troops in the street and my grandfather prepared a large urn of tea for them. He went out and came straight back. &apos;It&apos;s the Jews,&apos; he said and dropped the urn. No one wanted to believe that they were not Iraqis, but when it became clear everyone began to cry. For the older people it was very traumatic. They remembered 1948 and the refugees, and thought the same thing would happen again. After four days of curfew our family set off for home. We walked down the steps towards the Maghrebi Quarter [the community that abutted the Western Wall] and there was nothing there. Just piles of rubble and bulldozers at work with Israeli soldiers dancing on the ruins. I just wanted to know where all my friends had gone. My grandfather was forced to leave his home in the Jewish Quarter. But at least he had another house to go to. Many neighbours left for Jordan, but my parents were determined to stay. Within a few years I was jailed for political activities. I was involved with the Communist party and other leftist groups. I have spent about five years of my life in jail. I once read that 70 per cent of my generation have been in jail at least once since 1967. The Jordanian fighter pilotIhsan Shurdon Ihsan Shurdon was trained as a fighter pilot by the RAF and became a lieutenant-general in the Royal Jordanian Air Force. After he retired he remained an adviser to King Hussein. As a pilot he faced the superior Israeli air force in a subsonic Hawker Hunter. After the war, he befriended some of his Israeli counterparts The Jordanian air force was small but good. We knew that we would have to take on the Israelis, and we had great respect for them. In the event of war we planned to bomb six or seven key Israeli airfields, but when war approached, the Egyptians told us we would not be required. They would knock out the airfields and we would have a minor air-defence role, but I knew that in those days Migs [Soviet jets supplied to Egypt] could only fly as far as you could spit. The first time I saw an Israeli jet it was attacking the runway. When the siren went I scrambled as fast as I could and joined the Israeli formation. The Hunter was a very agile jet and our aim was to drag the Israeli Mirage and Super Mystere jets into a low-level, low-speed fight in which their air-to-air missiles would be less effective. A friend and I shot down four and drove off the last fighter in the formation. But by then I had been hit by our own ground fire and our runway was out of action, so I flew to Amman. As soon as I landed, new Israeli jets arrived. They cut the airfield and destroyed the aircraft. They were hit by anti-aircraft fire, but they didn&apos;t go down. Before the war, King Hussein was in a corner: Syria and Egypt accused him of being a collaborator and an agent of imperialism. He was also persuaded that Israel had aggressive intentions towards him. The king felt that the only way that he could get protection from Syria, Egypt and Israel was to join the Unified Arab Command. Jordan was meant to receive planes and troops, but they never came. It was a fiasco. When the war started we were told the Egyptians had destroyed 75 per cent of the Israeli air force, while the Syrians had destroyed double the number of Mirages that Israel actually had. Although Jordan lost the West Bank and Jerusalem, it is not clear that Jordan would exist in the same form as it does now anyway - without the war, the king may not have been able to hold on to his throne. I feel the Israelis are sitting on their major threat to security, the Palestinians (not the Iranians). In spite of all the loss of life in recent years, Israel cannot say it has achieved total security for its citizens. The question of Palestine will not go away. The Israeli paratrooperUri Geller Uri Geller, 61, is world-famous for his spoon-bending and claimed psychic powers. He lives with his family in Berkshire, but he was born in Israel, and though he spent part of his youth in Cyprus he had returned to Tel Aviv barely a year before the 1967 war  I came back to Israel in my late teens and for a year or so worked in various jobs - as a courier, a construction worker... Then I got my call-up papers, and I volunteered for the paratroopers. I had basic training and had gone on to the officers&apos; course at the time of the war. Not long before it broke out a close friend of mine died. I was very upset, and when I fell asleep on manoeuvres I was sent home. The next day I woke up hearing sirens all over Tel Aviv. I turned on the radio and the announcer was screaming: &apos;Israeli air force jets have destroyed the Egyptian air force.&apos; I jumped on my scooter and drove like mad to join my unit. My captain put me in charge of eight soldiers in two command cars. Our orders were to take this hill in Ramallah that was heavily fortified with Jordanian Patton tanks. King Hussein had started to build his summer villa there. The battle started. All my friends were being shot. My commander was shot. A shell went straight into his light-armoured vehicle and he died in front of me. Then I suddenly noticed a Jordanian soldier from behind me. He looked into my eyes and was about to shoot me. It was an amazing moment: we were staring at each other for what seemed an eternity. I saw my whole life, a film version, flash through my mind. Then suddenly I snapped out of this trance - it must have been a millisecond - and I realised that whoever pulled the trigger first was going to survive. I guess I was faster. I shot him. Shells were exploding all around. Israeli jets were diving on to the hill. My first reaction was very strange: I did what I&apos;d seen in American war films - I removed his military ID tag. About 20 minutes later I was hit in my right arm. Then I was hit in my left arm, which shattered my elbow - even today I can&apos;t fully stretch it out. And then something hit me over my left eye and I passed out. I woke up in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. I&apos;d seen my friends die. One of them died in my arms. The driver of the light-armoured command vehicle lost his leg. I had to drag him out. It&apos;s something that you never, ever forget. Killing another human being face to face tapped into a kind of hidden spirituality in me. You want to know - you want to believe, deeply - that someday you will meet that person. And to this day, I think of that Jordanian soldier as my brother. It&apos;s almost like he is embedded in my soul. I&apos;ve always been religious, and I know that I will meet him some day, in the afterlife. After the war I became a vegetarian and I became obsessed with guns: in New York, I had a licence to own seven handguns. Success came to me, as well as bulimia, panic attacks, anxiety. And I think all of this somehow started with the war. Over the centuries, for thousands of years, we have been fighting the same war - for a safe Jewish existence. The only change, I think, is that we are using more sophisticated weapons. The hatred between Arabs and Israelis is so deep, so vicious that it will take generations to eradicate. Little kids are being taught to hate the Jewish race, and particularly Israel. The Palestinian studentSari Nusseibeh The 58-year-old president of Al-Quds university in Jerusalem, Sari Nusseibeh is descended from one of the major families in Palestinian politics. His late father, Anwar, was wounded in the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, then became involved in abortive efforts to set up a Palestinian government in exile and finally returned to Jerusalem, holding ministerial posts in the Jordanian government. Sari Nusseibeh was the Jerusalem representative of Arafat&apos;s Palestine National Authority, but quit in 2002 to focus on peace efforts. Along with ex-Israeli navy chief Ami Ayalon, he set up &apos;The People&apos;s Voice&apos; in favour of a &apos;historic compromise&apos; to end the conflict. He was 18 during the Six-Day War I was in London when the war started, at high school. There were a lot [of Palestinians and other Arabs] studying in London. We tried to contact our parents, but for several days there was no answer and we were very worried. My father was in Jerusalem and so were my mother and brothers. The rest of the family was in different places. But my parents had taken my brothers and other people in the neighbourhood to an underground shelter. I went home that summer, after the war. My elder brother went back first. He flew to Jordan. The borders were still fairly open - not in the sense that the Israelis were allowing people to go through, but there wasn&apos;t sufficient surveillance, so a lot of people smuggled themselves in. So my brother came back across the Jordan River to Jerusalem. But I got permission from the Israeli authorities, so I flew in from the west, through Tel Aviv. It was very peculiar coming into Jerusalem from the west. I&apos;d never done it before in my life. We landed at the airport and it looked like a madhouse to me. I didn&apos;t understand the language, or the people. For all my life, geographically, Palestine had been divided - the state of Israel on the coast, and the West Bank ruled by Jordan, with Jerusalem itself also divided. Driving back home from the airport, I could see a countryside that in the past 19 years had been a kind of dream. It&apos;s a peculiar thing about the 1967 war that while the Arabs lost, and the West Bank and Gaza came under Israeli occupation, for the first time in 20 years Palestine was physically reunited. My father&apos;s family is Jerusalemite, going back generations. My mother&apos;s family is from a place inside Palestine, now Israel, now called Netziona. Her father had been expelled from the country, first to the Seychelles. He made his way to Cairo, but was prevented from coming back for a few more years, before finally managing to return and settle in Ramleh until the [1948] war broke out. He passed away just before the war and so my mother, her family, had to leave. My own father by then had been shot. He was in hospital, and his leg had been amputated. My mother, with the older kids, went to Damascus, where I was born. The days after the 1967 war were a period of discovery. I had to reassess my entire knowledge of politics. I went to Oxford, then London University. I was running out of money, so I found a job in the Gulf. I got married, and my wife and I then continued our studies at Harvard. In 1978, we came back and started teaching at Bir Zeit on the West Bank. I think the lesson of the 1967 war is that things don&apos;t work out the way you plan. I don&apos;t think either side has achieved their purpose. The Jewish people set out to set up a Jewish state, and the Arab national movement set out to set up a Palestinian Arab national state. Nothing is impossible, but neither side now looks in a position to do that. The Egyptian activistIslah Jad Islah Jad was 16 and living in Cairo when the Six-Day War broke out. She and her family were devoted to Nasser. During protests in the Seventies, she met her Palestinian husband and now lives in Ramallah, where she is a lecturer I was a member of a youth group connected to the ruling party, the National Union. We had a camp which was supposed to prepare us to take our role in society and the party. It was semi-military and I wore a blue uniform which was similar to the clothes worn by the Vietnamese Communists. We used to listen to the news in the evenings and when we heard Egypt had closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels everyone was very enthusiastic. We wanted to stop Israel&apos;s expansion in our land and we felt this was a vital battle to re-dress all the wrongs that had been done to the Palestinians. We had a blackout, so we used to listen to the national station in darkness. We believed the Israelis were losing and ignored the stations that said otherwise. They were, we thought, linked to the enemy. Everything else was normal. There was food and services, so there was no sense of crisis. But slowly it became clear things were not right. A neighbour had two sons in the army and had heard the Egyptian army was being slaughtered. Nasser&apos;s resignation that night, though, was the shock of my life. We left the apartment to join the crowds demanding that he should not go. Nasser was loved because he did so much for poor people. My education was full of sports, culture and holidays. Healthcare was free and we were able to buy Egyptian-made fridges and cars. We were the leaders of the Arab world. My doubts began in 1968 when I went to university. I became critical of the lies of the war, the power of the army and the lack of liberty. When Nasser died, nobody liked Anwar Sadat, his successor. We hated him. The legacy of 1967 remains strong in Egypt. The war caused many internal problems. The need to increase the military budget damaged economic development, which affected education, health and increased social gaps. Egypt&apos;s peace with Israel meant it broke ranks with the rest of the Arab world and lost its role as leader. The growing influence of the US led to the rise of Islamic militants, which has led to violence and forced the government to become more religious to compete with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Palestinian refugeeMahmoud Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah was three when he first became a refugee in 1948. His Palestinian family left West Jerusalem for the safety of the Old City, but could not return. When the war broke out, Abdullah was studying public health in Beirut. He became a refugee again in Jordan and did not see his parents in Jerusalem until 1972. He has spent most of his life managing refugee camps in Jordan for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), set up in 1948 to look after Palestinian refugees We left West Jerusalem on a cart with a few belongings and our cat. We were told that we would be able to go back in a few days or weeks. We settled in a small room in the Jewish Quarter and were moved out to a new refugee camp in Jerusalem in 1966. It was hard, but I was able to get an education and go to Beirut to study. It was a time of optimism before the war. We were all fascinated by Nasser and we believed if the Arabs were united they could defeat anyone. We were glued to the radio in the dormitories and the cafeteria and were happy when we heard that the Israeli air force had been destroyed. It meant that all of us from Jaffa, Jerusalem or the Galilee could go home. Slowly the truth began to emerge. We could not believe that the Egyptians had been so weak after their years of bragging. We cried like children. We were lost; we were outside our homes and we had nowhere to go. My friends and I began to feel that the defeat was as much about the betrayal by the Arab leaders as it was about the strength of Israel. I began to trust the Israelis more than the Arab leaders. Looking back, we have suffered more at the hands of the Arab leaders than at the hands of the Israelis, although the Israelis have made up for lost time since the Nineties. What the Arabs are offering Israel now, recognition in return for a Palestinian state, they could have offered years ago. They knew they were too weak to make war, but they didn&apos;t want to make peace. While I was studying we had planned to do field work in Gaza, but that was no longer possible. We were sent to Jordan instead, where we helped set up the refugee camps. I distributed tents, hot meals and anything else that was needed. But then the Israelis started raiding the Jordan Valley, so the camps were moved. I lived in tents for the first few years, but we were fortunate because UNRWA was very experienced at dealing with refugees, so they built food centres and schools very quickly. And some of the new refugees were doctors and teachers. I only left the camps in 1985, when I moved to Amman. I still don&apos;t feel accepted here. There is so much discrimination against the Palestinians in Jordan. We built 90 per cent of this country, but we still have no access to many jobs. I have to pay for my children&apos;s education, while Jordanians can always get scholarships. There is no way that the rights of 4.25m refugees can be ignored. There will never be peace when there is no justice. We need to have three states, Israel, Palestine and Jordan, with open borders. We all need to live together - there&apos;s no point in putting walls between us. The Egyptian journalistYael Dayan In June 1967 Yael Dayan was already an acclaimed writer, but she was best known as the daughter of Moshe Dayan, Israel&apos;s defence minister. As a military journalist she was attached to Ariel Sharon&apos;s division, which invaded the Sinai peninsula on 5 June and within four days reached the Suez Canal. After the war she became a leading left-wing politician and was highly critical of Israel&apos;s military policies and its settlement of the West Bank and Gaza. In 1992 she entered the Knesset as a member of the Labour party, but later joined the more left-wing Meretz party. She is now the deputy mayor of Tel Aviv War was in the air and it was just a question of who would start it. There was a genuine fear for the future in Israel. We were a small population, the army was everybody, it wasn&apos;t an abstract concept. We knew our brothers, cousins and friends, and we knew they were undefeatable. Since then all our wars have been avoidable, yet as a people we have become swamped and indoctrinated by false fears. As I drove south to join the army, though, I was young enough to think in adventurous terms. I wasn&apos;t crazy: my passion was for writing not killing, but I was going to join people I knew very well, like a family. Once there, the waiting seemed to last forever. Sharon kept everyone at a high state of readiness. I met my husband just before the beginning of the war. He was a liaison between Sharon and the central and southern command. Romance was rare because I was the only woman most of the time. I was treated well and I certainly didn&apos;t play the feminist. When they wanted someone to help the cook do something wonderful with the rations, I was happy to help. In the week before the war, we moved from neutral into first gear. Sharon was remarkable, he always kept his humour and his cool. At the time there were no political differences, so we talked and joked. Sharon, Rabin [the chief of staff and later prime minister] and my father were all from the same background; they were all secular and patriotic. There was much less religion in the army then. The only voice of God people heard was the voice of their commander. When the war came it was exciting. I was with Sharon the whole time in his jeep. We first came under attack in a fortified wadi. There was a battle with all the noise and smoke, but it did not really register. When your enemy is a distant target, then war makes unfortunate sense. But when you see the enemy eye to eye as humans it&apos;s much more difficult. The prisoners crowded around us begging for mercy. Some ran away, but we didn&apos;t shoot them because there was nowhere to run to. I never felt scared apart from a time when our jets attacked. They began their dive and we knew they were not Egyptians, but the pilots realised who we were before it was too late. Eventually we got to the Suez Canal. I was glad to see the water, but I did not feel the excitement of victory in conquering Sinai. I was excited at having achieved a level of protection for our people. There was no sense that we had come to these places (Sinai, Golan, the West Bank and Gaza) to stay. What changed? We became possessive of our new acquisitions and inflamed with a religious zeal.

It was a familiar dirge amid the weathered blocks of flats on the Mediterranean seafront of Tel Aviv in the early months of 1967. Air-raid drills were just one sign of escalating tension between the precarious, teenage state of Israel and a coalition of surrounding Arab neighbours led by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser&apos;s Egypt. But this time - on the morning of 5 June 1967 - few Israelis doubted the wails of warning meant war. Few were confident it would end in victory. Fewer still felt that if victory did come, it would come easily, or soon. On the last score, they would be proven utterly and spectacularly wrong. Within hours, Israeli jets would destroy virtually all Egypt&apos;s 450 combat aircraft on the ground. By the day&apos;s end, the Syrian air force would be similarly crippled. A day later, Israeli troops were fighting their way across the concrete and barbed wire that divided the disputed holy city of Jerusalem into its Israeli-held west and its Jordanian-ruled east - and capturing Judaism&apos;s holiest site, the Western Wall, sole surviving remnant of the ancient Jewish temple. Ground fighting, often fierce, rumbled on for four more days, with Israel ultimately going on to capture the entire West Bank from Jordan on its eastern flank; Gaza and the Sinai desert from Egypt in the south; and the towering Golan Heights from Syria in the north. In barely 130 hours, the fighting was all over. Yet however quick, the war had not been bloodless. Israel lost about 1,100 dead, the Egyptians more than 10,000, the Syrians 2,500 and Jordan about 700. And some 300,000 Palestinians from the West Bank fled the fighting eastward into Jordan - in some cases &apos;double refugees&apos;, because they had also lost their homes in the fighting surrounding the establishment of Israel 20 years earlier. It is now four decades since the Six-Day War, but its effects reverberate still - in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, the Middle East and the wider world. When Tony Blair shuttles to Jerusalem and Ramallah and Cairo speaking of the urgency of getting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track; when George Bush and Condoleezza Rice proclaim a commitment to the &apos;diplomatic road map&apos;; when a Saudi-led Arab summit urges a &apos;land-for-peace&apos; deal; or when al-Qaeda propagandists cite &apos;Palestine&apos; among the litany of grievances to recruit suicide bombers to pilot passenger planes into New York skyscrapers or blow up tube trains in London; all, in their own ways, are negotiating the unfinished business of six days of war in June 1967. When the war broke out, Israel was barely 19 years old, and barely 10 miles wide at its narrowest point. There were none of the luxury hotels, pricey restaurants or all-night bars and clubs that today dot Tel Aviv&apos;s seafront; none of the hi-tech businesses that lie northwards up the coast. Israel&apos;s equivalent of the BBC would not introduce television broadcasts until the following year. The state had been established in 1948 on the back of a UN resolution partitioning British Mandate Palestine into two states: one a national home for the Jews, six million of whom had been murdered in Hitler&apos;s Holocaust, the other for Palestinian Arabs. The Arab states rejected the plan, and their armies invaded when Israel declared statehood. Israel survived, winning a protracted battle it called the War of Independence. In Arabic it is known, to this day, simply as al naqba - the catastrophe. The Arab world - politically at least - was also unrecognisably different in the early days of June 1967. The Palestinian issue was, then as now, a central rallying cry. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, after all, had fled or been forced out of what became Israel in the 1948 war. But as an independent political voice, they were so feeble as to be barely audible, dismissed not only by Israel but by Arab kings and presidents whose own national interests, or pretensions to claim leadership of a wider nationalist cause, took precedence. The Palestine Liberation Organisation existed. Yet it was a creature of Nasser and run by an acolyte named Ahmad Shukeiri. By the spring of 1967, Nasser - with his charismatic podium presence and Soviet-supplied military - was determined to fashion a powerful alliance of Israel&apos;s Arab neighbours to reverse once and for all the humiliation of 1948. He found an avid partner in another Kremlin ally, Syria&apos;s President Hafez al-Assad, and a willing, if less eager, one in the pro-western King Hussein of Jordan. For months, tension had been mounting, with strikes and counter-strikes on Israel&apos;s borders. Whether either side truly wanted, or expected, full-scale war remains uncertain four decades later. What is clear is that each side, increasingly, became convinced the other was bent on confrontation. In Israel, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol - a competent but colourless Labour successor to the country&apos;s founding leader, David Ben-Gurion - was so halting in his response to the rising tension that he was sowing something very near to panic among his generals. Addressing the nation on the radio in May, he fumbled at his notes, stumbled in his delivery and within days was forced to bring the eyepatched war veteran Moshe Dayan into his cabinet as defence minister in an emergency &apos;unity&apos; government to steady the country&apos;s nerves. In Egypt, Nasser was sabre-rattling, but had yet clearly to demonstrate that he was poised to move from rhetoric to battle. But in the final weeks of May he took a series of steps that were to make war inevitable. On the 16th, he demanded the removal of a UN buffer force deployed in the Sinai since the disastrous British-French-Israeli seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956. On 22 May, Nasser announced what amounted to a blockade of Israel, closing the Strait of Tiran and the top of the Red Sea to Israeli shipping. And he then ordered some 100,000 troops, with almost 1,000 tanks and 1,000 other armoured vehicles - well over half of his armed forces - into the Sinai, near Israel&apos;s southern border. At the month&apos;s end, he declared: &apos;The Arabs are arranged for battle. The critical hour has arrived.&apos; It was Israel, shortly after 7am on 5 June, that struck first, attacking and destroying Egypt&apos;s air force. When Jordanian troops and artillery joined the war from the east, and the Syrians from the Golan, Israel struck on both those fronts. And by 10 June, the fighting was over. The next morning, Levi Eshkol&apos;s top aides were gathered in his office in a mood of relief, astonishment and celebration, when the Prime Minister walked in and - one of them later recalled - said: &apos;What are you so happy about?&apos; In military terms, the victory had been extraordinary. Within the space of a week, a narrow, seaside Israel had tripled in size. Militarily and strategically, it had been transformed from precarious prey to regional superpower. &apos;Eshkol&apos;s mood was surprisingly sober,&apos; the aide recounted. &apos;He saw that our political problems were only just beginning.&apos; And they were. The initial hope among Israel&apos;s political leaders was that at least the bulk of land they had captured could be traded for treaties of peace with Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Yet there were early signs that they saw the prospect of a deal with Jordan - involving, as it did, the future of the West Bank and of Jerusalem - as by far the most complicated. Egypt&apos;s Sinai and the Syrian Golan were fairly sparsely populated. The only reason to hold on to them would be as a strategic buffer, a function the Israelis figured could be retained in a future land-for-peace deal by ensuring they were &apos;demilitarised&apos;. Jerusalem was different: it was Judaism&apos;s holiest site and ancient capital, for 19 years divided, now wholly under Israeli rule. The West Bank, too, had powerful historical resonance for Israelis. For the assertively Orthodox, a minority in Israel whose huge effect on settlement policy began in the months after the 1967 war, the attraction was particularly powerful: the place names of its towns and villages were part of the biblical narrative they read aloud each week in synagogue. But in the weeks after the war other, secular Israelis also voted with their picnic baskets. They eagerly visited the undivided Jerusalem - with the area around the Western Wall and the ancient Jewish Quarter of the walled Old City soon cleared by Israeli bulldozers. They also visited not only West Bank cities with biblical echoes such as Hebron, but sites such as Gush Etzion, where Jewish residents were twice violently forced out, first in 1929 and then a week before the establishment of Israel in 1948. A year after the war, the first of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank had been approved: at Gush Etzion and near Hebron. The decision came under a broadly secular Labour government, though amid pressure stoked by a burgeoning movement of Orthodox nationalist settlers known as Gush Emunim, the Bloc of the Faithful. Other settlements followed, particularly under Menachem Begin&apos;s right-wing Israeli government in the late Seventies and early Eighties. By then, the aim of the settlements was clear and openly stated: to underline Begin&apos;s determination to hold on to overall control of the West Bank under any future peace deal, and to rule out ever agreeing to a Palestinian state there. In truth, though, whatever early hopes Israeli harboured for peace deals after the 1967 war were, in any case, soon scotched by Arab leaders. Having suffered a battlefield humiliation far worse than 1948, they were more determined than ever to reject a political compromise. At an Arab summit held in Khartoum two months after the war, they made their rejection official. They formally adopted a platform of &apos;three nos&apos; - no to recognition of Israel, no to negotiations, no to peace with Israel. But while it was not widely recognised at the time, the most far-reaching effect of the war in the Arab world would be to destroy the ability of Nasser, or any other Arab president or monarch, credibly to speak any longer on behalf of the Palestinians. An Egyptian-born Palestinian nationalist named Yasser Arafat and a tight band of comrades had in the late Fifties formed a new Palestinian group called al-Fatah. Within months of the Six-Day War, Arafat began to emerge as the voice of a new, militant and independent brand of Palestinian nationalism. By 1969, he - not Nasser&apos;s Shukeiri - was head of the PLO. Israel was slow to recognise, or at least accept, the implications. It was not until more than a decade after the Six-Day War that Israel made serious attempts to negotiate a peaceful resolution of the core problem it created - the future of the West Bank and Jerusalem - with the local Palestinian Arabs who lived there rather than through Jordan or Egypt. It would be a further two decades before any direct talks with Arafat or the PLO. The years since have been blighted by diplomatic failure, terrible violence and suffering on both sides. But neither side doubts any longer that the only workable alternative is a directly negotiated agreement, however elusive, on the future of the ancient towns and olive hilltops of the West Bank, of Jerusalem and of the Israelis and Palestinians who live there. In short, no one doubts that Middle East peace depends on resolving the decades-long repercussions of those six days of war. Six days in JuneAnatomy of a war Day 1: 5 June 1967 Israel launches the first wave of attacks on Egypt at 7:10am, Israeli time. Israel claims that Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser is trying to exert too much influence in the Middle East, in particular moving Egyptian forces into the Sinai desert in May 1967. Under Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and defence minister Moshe Dayan the air attack, which was named Operation Focus, begins. Lethal 180lb Durandal bombs, developed jointly with the French and described as &apos;tarmac shredders&apos;, destroy nearly 400 Egypt-based military aircraft and leave craters in the runway more than 5m wide and 1.6m deep, Day 2: 6 June Israel conquers the Gaza strip, defeating part of the Egyptian army. Day 3: 7 June Israeli paratroops seize control of the Western Wall and the old city of Jerusalem. Israel then deploys 40,000 troops and 200 tanks against the Jordanian army, conquering the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Moshe Dayan and chief of staff Yitzhak Rabin arrive in Jerusalem to mark the Jews&apos; return to the holy site. Around 325,000 Palestinians living in the West Bank flee to other parts of Jordan. Day 4: 8 June Israel captures the whole of Sinai, defeating the Egyptian forces. Day 5: 9 June Fighting between Israeli and Egyptian forces continues in the Golan region. In a televised speech, Nasser angrily blames the US and UK for Egypt&apos;s losses, and for assisting Israel. He also announces his resignation. This is met with aircraft fire and people on the streets protesting against his decision to step down. Day 6: 10 June Israel defeats the Syrian army in the Golan Heights and conquers Masada Fighting in the Middle East finally ends after Israel observes the UN ceasefire and halts its advance into Syria President Nasser announces his decision to remain in office. Thousands of Egyptians rejoice on the streets of Cairo and other Arab cities The war lasted 132 hours, one of the shortest in recorded history.Victoria-Anne Bull", "publicationDate": "2007-05-06T09:24:56Z", "title": "Ned Temko on the far-reaching implications of Israel's 1967 attack on Egypt", "sentences": ["It was a familiar dirge amid the weathered blocks of flats on the Mediterranean seafront of Tel Aviv in the early months of 1967.", "There were none of the luxury hotels, pricey restaurants or all-night bars and clubs that today dot Tel Aviv&apos;s seafront; none of the hi-tech businesses that lie northwards up the coast."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/06/israelandthepalestinians.features"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Al-Muhajiroun"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday May 20 2007   In the article below, the Bluewater shopping centre was said to be in Kent. It is in Essex. This has been corrected.    Rewind to London, Sunday, 8 September, 1996. Al-Muhajiroun, an obscure Islamist organisation, has booked the London Arena in Docklands for a conference dedicated to &apos;the struggle for Khilafah&apos;, the creation of an Islamic state. Speakers are to include Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, al-Muhajiroun&apos;s leader, who 10 years later will flee Britain to Lebanon after praising the 7 July London bombers. Video addresses will be beamed in and letters of support are to be read. There will be one from Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas leader held in an Israeli prison for authorising the execution of two Israeli soldiers. There is another from Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, jailed in the US for plotting to set off bombs in New Jersey and New York. There will also be an address on behalf of a man called Sheikh al-Jihad, better known as Osama Bin Laden, who a month earlier had publicly declared war on America. Bin Laden&apos;s address, according to the conference organisers, will refer to the heroes of the Taliban. It will talk about Muslim suffering, about injustice, about the need to take action. For al-Muhajiroun this is a coming of age moment, the day the group emerged from its hinterland and on to the world stage. At the time the conference, which the organisers cancelled at the last moment, raised hardly a blip on the radar of British intelligence. Now The Observer can reveal how al-Muhajiroun became the incubator of a global terror network that played a decisive role in radicalising the five &apos;fertiliser bomb&apos; plotters jailed for life last week for planning a multiple bombing campaign at targets that included the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and Britain&apos;s domestic gas network. The fertiliser bomb plotters were typical of those al-Muhajiroun found and indoctrinated. The parents of many of those the group attracted pleaded desperately with their sons to break away. But al-Muhajiroun&apos;s appeal was irresistible. Hundreds embraced Bakri&apos;s call to jihad and, with al-Muhajiroun&apos;s help were dispatched to terror training camps in Pakistan. The bomb trial heard how the five - Omar Khyam, Waheed Mahmood, Anthony Garcia, Jawad Akbar and Saladhuddin Amin, all Home Counties twentysomethings interested in sport and studying - were transformed from moderate Muslims into angry radicals keen to fight abroad. And at the heart of their conversion lay Bakri and his network of lieutenants whom he despatched to campuses, mosques and prayer centres to spread his message. &apos;While extremists are not always terrorists, terrorists are always extremists,&apos; said Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies. &apos;The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.&apos; With hindsight the Islamic International Conference should have set off alarm bells. But the reaction from on high to the group&apos;s emergence was muted. Few politicians wanted to be seen to criticise ethnic and religious minorities when what passed for multiculturalism was an all-encompassing ideology. Instead the rantings of Bakri, his acolyte, Abu Hamza, the hook-handed cleric now serving seven years for inciting murder, and their growing number of followers, were dismissed simply as the headline-grabbing posturings of a lunatic fringe. The security service&apos;s assessment was that those brainwashed by al-Muhajiroun would simply end up dying in some corner of a foreign battlefield that was of no concern to Britain. As Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yard&apos;s Counter-Terrorism Command, said last month: &apos;In the Nineties many people believed extremists from overseas regimes who were active in the UK were, if anything, pursuing agendas against foreign governments, and posed little or no threat to the UK.&apos; This failure allowed a dangerous global network to flourish. A network that has come back to haunt Britain and shows no sign of being dismantled. Forward: New York 2002. Everyone who knew Syed Hashmi says he was a good kid. Born in Pakistan but brought up in New York&apos;s gritty borough of Queens, friends recall Hashmi as a caring, bright young man, whose devotion to Islam was passionate but not of the sort that marked him out from any other Muslims. But things changed when Hashmi switched colleges, leaving Stony Brook University in Long Island for the more mixed Brooklyn College, from where he graduated with a degree in political science in 2003. It was at Brooklyn that Hashmi, 23, discovered al-Muhajiroun, inviting a member to speak at his campus. At the time the memory of the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Centre was hardwired into New York&apos;s consciousness. People were edgy and security services more vigilant. One prominent Muslim radical who lived in Queens had been a particular concern. In November 2001 Mohammed Babar, a naturalised US citizen who had been born in Pakistan, attracted the interest of US intelligence when he openly declared in a TV interview that he was willing to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. &apos;My loyalty will forever be with the Muslims,&apos; he said, despite his mother having narrowly escaped from the World Trade Centre when the planes struck. Shortly after 9/11, Babar, who had been recruited by al-Muhajiroun in 2000, disappeared off the US intelligence service&apos;s radar. He had fled to Pakistan where he stayed at al-Muhajiroun&apos;s office in Lahore before buying an apartment in the city&apos;s Eden Heights suburb in 2002. Over the next two years, the flat became a temporary home to a conveyor belt of radicalised British Muslims, many of whom, like Babar, had been born in Pakistan and wanted to fight. Angered by what they saw as the West&apos;s failure to protect Bosnian Muslims in the Nineties war in the former Yugoslavia, their sense of grievance was heightened by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and the turmoil in Chechnya and Kashmir. Many of those who stayed there ended up at the Malakand training camp hidden in Pakistan&apos;s North West Frontier Province. It was there that Mohammed Siddique Khan, an al-Muhajiroun convert and the ringleader of the 7/7 plot that killed 52 people in London, learnt his murderous skills. Other Britons at the camp in the summer of 2003 included Omar Khyam, ringleader of the fertiliser bombers. He attended the camp with Saladhuddin Amin, later to play a key role in the plot. Along with scores of other militants the pair practised making explosives, detonating devices in the camp. Until now the details of how Babar met the fertiliser bomb plotters have been hazy. But documents filed by the US authorities who are extraditing him from the UK, say it was Hashmi, described as one of al-Muhajiroun&apos;s top recruiters, who brought the American, Babar, into the organisation where he later met the British fertiliser bomb plotters. Hashmi, who moved to Britain from Queens in 2003, allegedly allowed his London flat to be used to store supplies and money that Babar was shipping out to Abdul al-Hadi al-Iraqi, then head of al-Qaeda&apos;s operations in Afghanistan. The supplies included ponchos, torches and boots, useful for recruits fighting US troops in remote parts of Afghanistan. Hashmi was arrested on 8 June last year as he tried to board a plane from Heathrow to Pakistan carrying thousands of pounds in cash. If convicted in the US he faces up to 54 years in prison. His lawyers say he will deny all the charges and that much of the evidence against him is conflicting. A Canadian, Momin Khawaja, said to be a close associate of Babar and al-Muhajiroun, will soon stand trial in his own country for his alleged role in the fertiliser bomb plot. Both trials threaten to shine new light on the links between al-Muhajiroun&apos;s operations in North America and Britain - links the US authorities are playing down. Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security Secretary, quickly blamed British Islamists, but it is increasingly clear al-Muhajiroun&apos;s influence in the US spawned a small army of jihadists who exported the movement&apos;s ideology around the world. As Babar, who turned supergrass against the fertiliser bombers, admitted at the trial, the US arm of al-Muhajiroun was a key component in its success. &apos;Most influence started in the early Nineties - Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed here in the UK,&apos; Babar said. &apos;They [al-Muhajiroun] had representatives in New York. I was able to meet them on the internet. We spoke numerous times over the phone and there was a lot of literature available on the internet.&apos; The influence of al-Muhajiroun is apparent in the number of terrorists it allegedly influenced. The shoe bomber, Richard Reid, was seen at several al-Muhajiroun meetings in Ilford, east London, in the months before his failed attempt to blow up American Airlines Flight 63 flying between Paris and Miami. One regular visitor to the group&apos;s north London office was Asif Hanif, 21, from Hounslow, west London. On 29 April, 2003, he walked into Mike&apos;s Bar, a crowded cafe in Tel Aviv, Israel, and detonated his explosive belt, killing three people and injuring 60 others. Haroon Rasheed Aswad, another prominent member of al-Muhajiroun, was arrested in 2005 accused of attempting to set up a terror training camp for British and American jihadists in Oregon. In 2005 Mobeen Muneef, 25, a Londoner, was picked up by US Marines on patrol in Ramadi, southern Iraq, after being caught allegedly passing weapons to insurgents. Muneef is believed to have attended al-Muhajiroun lectures in London. But then, if the US needed reminding of the threat al-Muhajiroun posed to its own, it needed only to read a leaked memo by an FBI agent named Kenneth Williams. Written on 10 July, 2001, the memo warns bin Laden was attempting to send recruits to civil aviation colleges in the US. The document notes that the head of al-Muhajiroun, Omar Bakri Mohammed, had been receiving faxes from bin Laden in which the al-Qaeda leader urges Muslims to take action against the West: &apos;Bring down their airliners. Prevent the safe passage of their ships. Occupy their embassies. Force the closure of their banks.&apos; Pause: east London, the Nineties. Few people can fathom how young British men are capable of turning on their country and killing innocent people, even if it sometimes involves killing themselves in the process. The five fertilizer bomb plotters were not loners, hiding away to nurture a discernible grudge against society. Three were married and two had children. Ed Husain, a former member of Hizb-ut Tahrir, the radical group from which Omar Bakri Mohammed split to set up al-Muhajiroun, is one of the few who knows how the conversion process from moderate to radical works. Like most of the fertiliser bombers, Husain grew up in a moderate Muslim family, but was radicalised in his teens. &apos;I grew up with a sense of being both Muslim and British,&apos; Husain said. &apos;I went to a multicultural primary school and I really enjoyed it. But when I went to Stepney Green secondary school the atmosphere changed. It was a single-sex school, with boys predominantly from Bangladesh. There was nothing British about that school. It could have been in Karachi. My only choice at school was to become a gang member or become an Islamist.&apos; Husain, who last week published a book about his experiences, The Islamist, says his first exposure to radical Islam came in religious education lessons at the school. &apos;We read a basic textbook that linked Islam and politics as the same and spoke about the Muslim Brotherhood as a perfectly legitimate organisation.&apos; It appears a culture of Islamism was entrenched at the school. &apos;Prayers were being led by people linked to the East London Mosque. When my father heard they were holding these sessions he asked me to stop praying at school. I refused.&apos; By then Husain was hooked. &apos;Eventually I was invited to the mosque. The atmosphere was radically different to my parent&apos;s mosque. There were young, dynamic Muslims. They were people I could identify with.&apos; By then Husain&apos;s parents were deeply unhappy with the company he was keeping, and tried to persuade him to leave the mosque, known for its extreme brand of Islam. &apos;My parents knew I was betraying what they had raised me on. After trying to convince me, they gave me an ultimatum - either leave Islamism or leave the house. People at the mosque told me it was a test from God. &apos;So one night I wrote a note to my parents and left for the mosque. My mother phoned at nine the next morning. The caretaker answered and said I wasn&apos;t there. I was sitting right beside him. I could hear my mother crying. That was my first moment of doubt about these people. But by then I couldn&apos;t leave. My family had lost and I had won. It was a process of indoctrination.&apos; Husain joined Hizb-ut Tahrir after meeting Bakri. &apos;People at the mosque could identify problems but couldn&apos;t offer solutions,&apos; he says. &apos;Bakri offered a direct solution: the establishment of Muslim state with a foreign policy of jihad. There was a powerful message: this was the only way to be a Muslim.&apos; The government continues to resist demands to proscribe Hizb-ut Tahrir, despite continued concerns about its influence expressed by both the Pakistan and US authorities. Press play: Present-day Britain. Somewhere in the UK hides a deeply disturbed 27-year-old would-be suicide bomber, a close friend of Asif Hanif, who killed himself and three others in Mike&apos;s Bar in Tel Aviv and an associate of several fertiliser bomb plotters, including Babar. The man, referred to as at the trial as &apos;Imran&apos;, has been on the run since last year.He had returned to the UK after a spell in a Pakistani jail, where he had been interrogated by MI6 over his links to suspected terrorists. When he was arrested in 2005, Pakistani intelligence found &apos;Imran&apos; had the telephone numbers of several defendants in the fertilizer bomb plot trial, as well as high-ranking al-Qaeda figures. The jury heard the plotters had approached &apos;Imran&apos; to become a suicide bomber but he had bailed out at the eleventh hour, believing they would not go through with their side of the plan. &apos;Imran&apos;, who had been radicalised by al-Muhajiroun in Britain before linking up with its office in Lahore, also admitted to the Pakistani authorities that he had met two of the 7/7 bombers, Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shezhad Tanweer, at a jihadist training camp in late 2004. His story should act as a warning: al-Muhajiroun&apos;s legacy lingers and its followers are still out there. Bakri may be in exile but he still spreads his message from his luxury flat overlooking the Mediterranean in Beirut where his neighbours include the Egyptian ambassador. &apos;Al-Muhajiroun are still a threat because Bakri&apos;s followers continue to operate under different names giving leaflets out at mosques and universities,&apos; said Dr Irfan al-Alawi, director of the Centre for Islamic Pluralism. &apos;Bakri continues to preach his sermons via an internet chatroom from his exile, which means his evil ideology is still being practised by his followers who are part of a new group called Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah.&apos; These followers, notably Abu Izzadeen, charged last month with inciting terrorism overseas, have continued to preach incendiary sermons around the country. Splinter successor groups have emerged and, despite being proscribed by the government, continue to act as conduits for young radicals. Even Bakri acknowledges his former organisation&apos;s continuing influence. &apos;Al-Muhajiroun was a political party,&apos; he told The Observer. &apos;We were not a militant group. During my 20 years as an Islamic preacher in the UK, three or four thousand people heard me speak. I cannot be responsible for everything these people do. Yes, I spoke of jihad, but people have taken it out of context.&apos; The security service&apos;s greatest fear is that the hundreds, possibly thousands, of young men al-Muhajiroun helped dispatch to become &apos;holy warriors&apos; overseas are now returning to Britain, ready to turn their sights on domestic targets. The trend was predicted as far back as 2002 by Hassan Butt, a former al-Muhajiroun member who attended terror training camps in Pakistan. &apos;These were people I was meeting and these were people who decided to return to Britain to become sleeper cells,&apos; Butt said. The question is how many of those who returned will become active. It is an ugly conundrum for counter-terrorism services as they attempt to prioritise the most dangerous radicals. &apos;Intelligence suggests there are between 1,600 and 2,000 young Muslim men linked to terrorism in Britain,&apos; said one counter-terrorism source. &apos;At any one time 20 will be talking about jihad overseas. Do you pick them up or wait and see? What nobody can answer is what happened to Mohammed Sidique Khan to turn him from a radicalised young man to someone who wanted to kill himself. We just don&apos;t know.&apos; Answering the question may prevent further atrocities, but those charged with protecting Britain admit another successful attack is inevitable. And just as inevitably its perpetrator will have been influenced by an obscure Islamist group that appeared to have all of the answers: al-Muhajiroun. The origins of al-Muhajiroun Formed in 1996, al-Muhajiroun established a network that stretched around the world using public meetings and lectures in radical mosques. From an office in north London, the organisation maintained a presence in the US and Pakistan, gaining a reputation for extremist rhetoric. Under the leadership of Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, the group recruited young men from mosques, gyms and universities. Many members travelled to Pakistan to train in &apos;jihad&apos; camps before being dispatched to fight in Kashmir or Afghanistan or, as in the case of the 7/7 bombers and the fertiliser plotters, returning to the UK to plan domestic attacks. Al-Muhajiroun officially disbanded in 2004. A month after 7/7, fearing investigation by anti-terror police, Omar Bakri left the UK for Lebanon.

It said that while Israel had shown a willingness to relax specific restrictions, incremental steps lacked permanence and certainty and could be easily withdrawn or replaced by other restrictions. &quot;Moreover, sustainable economic recovery will remain elusive if large areas of the West Bank remain inaccessible for economic purposes and restricted movement remains the norm for the vast majority of Palestinians and expatriate Palestinian investors,&quot; the report added. Israel claimed its system of restrictions was necessary to counter terrorism. &quot;We have no interest whatsoever in seeing a failed Palestinian economy,&quot; the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Mark Regev, told the Associated Press. &quot;Many of the current problems are a direct result of terrorism, violence and political instability inside the Palestinian territories ... and the overall anarchy that exists.&quot; Many restrictions were imposed or tightened during the second Palestinian uprising, which began in 2000 and was accompanied by suicide bombings and shootings. In 2002, Israel began building the separation barrier it claims is meant to keep out attackers, but which the World Bank says has had a negative impact on the Palestinian economy. Israel has declared the area between the barrier and the pre-1967 borders - the green line - a &quot;closed area&quot; for an indefinite period. This so-called &quot;seam zone&quot; accounts roughly for 8.5% of West Bank territory, encompassing roughly 50,000 Palestinians in 38 towns and villages. A recent study cited by the World Bank, funded by the New Israel Fund and the British embassy in Tel Aviv, found that the current route of the barrier &quot;almost totally ignores the daily needs of the Palestinian population&quot;. It said the barrier was &quot;focused almost exclusively on the desire to maintain the fabric of life of Israeli settlers&quot;. According to the report, more than 50% of the West Bank is restricted for Palestinians, including land around 133 Jewish settlements and some 100 &quot;illegal outposts&quot;. The report said there were around 250,000 settlers in the West Bank, roughly twice the 129,000 who lived in the area at the time of the 1993 Oslo accords. Some 450 miles of major West Bank roads are for settlers or non-Palestinians only, forcing Palestinian motorists to use long detours. Apart from physical restrictions, Israel runs the population registry in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, determining who receives ID cards - and thus residency rights - after the age of 16, the bank said. The registry is linked to a permit system that can be used to control the movement of Palestinians outside their immediate municipal area and restrict access to large parts of the West Bank. The report said economic recovery and sustainable growth would &quot;require a fundamental reassessment of closure practices, a restoration of the presumption of movement, and review of Israeli control of the population registry and other means of dictating the residency of Palestinians within the West Bank and Gaza&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-09T10:33:00Z", "title": "World Bank criticises Israel over Palestinian economy", "sentences": ["A recent study cited by the World Bank, funded by the New Israel Fund and the British embassy in Tel Aviv, found that the current route of the barrier &quot;almost totally ignores the daily needs of the Palestinian population&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/09/imf.israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "China", "Pakistan", "Russia", "Indonesia", "Human rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Every time I embark on another political tour of this troubled country, I am struck by the number of foreign, seemingly unconnected, attendees with whom I share space on the bus. Leaving aside their clothes and hairstyles (&quot;I bet they come because the water cannon is the only opportunity they get to shower from one week to the next&quot; observed one of my more caustic companions recently), there is something unsettling about their mere presence, which I am yet to reconcile. Granted, the conflict in Israel is one of the world&apos;s greatest cottage industries, providing ample fodder for journalists, authors, tour guides and religious leaders alike - hence it&apos;s no surprise that the constant attention generates a vast number of political tourists. That said, packaging the conflict-ridden land as a safari park does no favours for the natives - be they Israeli or Palestinian. Israelis feel that too much exposure is given to their government&apos;s actions, and they become increasingly defensive as a result. The Millwall mantra of &quot;No one likes us - we don&apos;t care&quot; can easily be transposed on to an Israeli society distrustful of what it sees as biased external interference. Even I, having served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for 15 months, am still viewed as an outsider by many sabras when it comes to my meddling in Israeli affairs with my writing. &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about&quot;, they cry. &quot;You&apos;ve only been here a few years - you&apos;ve got a hell of a lot to learn&quot;. And they&apos;re right. I do. Which is why, thus far, I&apos;ve restrained myself from nailing my colours to any particular political mast. But if I - the fully Israeli ex-soldier - am still green around the gills after two and a half years, then what of the political activist who rocks up on these shores to pitch in their two shekels&apos; worth wherever they see fit? From NGO interns to International Solidarity Movement (ISM) volunteers; from Jewish yeshiva students on their gap year in Israel, to their secular peers on a Golan-to-Eilat summer tour - what gives them the right to get stuck into the politics with such gusto? Religious American youths were blamed for much of the public disorder in the build-up to last year&apos;s Gay Pride march. Egged on by their peers, bereft of any parental presence, they ran amok on the Jerusalem streets, setting fire to tyres and violently making their homophobic voices resonate around the city. Equally, ISM activists are notorious for their incitement of the army their goading of soldiers into confrontation, and are generally viewed as agent provocateurs on behalf of the Palestinians. The same Palestinians who will be left behind to deal with the consequences, long after the angry young protestors have packed up and flown home to the States. It&apos;s easy enough to dismiss the actions of these highly-charged campaigners as duplicitous and unbalanced. After all, if they&apos;re such fans of human rights (in the case of the ISM, et al), then why don&apos;t they traverse the globe promoting their ideals, rather than gathering en masse in Israel? Why aren&apos;t they chaining themselves to buildings in China, protesting the abuse of Tibetans? Why aren&apos;t they braving the sub-zero temperatures of Moscow, defending the cause of the Chechens? Why aren&apos;t they willing to take on the brutal regimes of Myanmar and Indonesia, if they&apos;re so concerned with social justice? Here&apos;s one answer: the causes above just aren&apos;t sexy enough, and won&apos;t score enough brownie points when the protestors are telling their tales back on their college campuses at home. Plus, you can combine activism with sunbathing when in Israel - you can protest against the &quot;apartheid wall&quot; in the morning, and by mid-afternoon be sunning yourself on a Tel Aviv beach with your mates. Another answer would be that Israel is far too soft a touch, when it comes to foreign activism. In all the examples above, from China to Myanmar, not a single person would expect to be able to travel to those places and get away with a tenth of the rabble rousing and incitement that they do in Israel. Protestors against these regimes would be locked up for years, if they were lucky, or if they were less fortunate they would be spirited away and never seen again. So why, if Israel is such a soft touch when it comes to foreign interference, is it so vilified in comparison with its peers in the global hall of shame? Is Israel really more brutal than China, Russia or Pakistan? I&apos;m well aware that Israel is guilty of serious human rights violations, and I&apos;m well aware that dissent is a powerful tool with which to try and end the abuses Israel carries out in my name. However, it&apos;s the unnaturally high interest that the outside world shows which disturbs me. And, I would propose, it doesn&apos;t do any favours to the Palestinian people. As I said earlier, when the &quot;no one likes us - we don&apos;t care&quot; attitude takes over, then the world will find that it has made the Israeli people far more intransigent than before, far less open to suggestion than they might otherwise have been. Policies that may have been incorporated as sensible and reasonable are dismissed out of hand by a government that cries foul purely because they emanate from outsiders, who are generally perceived as biased against the Israeli state. Witness the hysteria over Rachel Corrie and Tom Hurndall - modern day martyrs, beatified and canonised for their frankly unremarkable accomplishments. Sure, they came over here all guns blazing, desperate to have some kind of impact on a situation far bigger and more complex than they ever could have understood. But what - other than their unfortunate and untimely deaths - did they actually achieve? Their dying provoked a media storm that has yet to blow over, and has done untold damage to relations between Israel and the outside world. And Israel, when backed into a corner, is particularly adept at lashing out in the only way it knows how, namely against the undeserving Palestinians. Which is exactly what the peace activists don&apos;t want to happen. I don&apos;t know what the situation requires, in order for Israelis to stop feeling so under the cosh when it comes to world opinion. I don&apos;t advocate for the foreign presence to disappear. By and large, a lot of good can - and should - come of it. But what I do think needs addressing, and soon, is the concept of balanced activism. Until Israelis feel that they&apos;re being dealt with even-handedly, then the chances of them taking their hands off their ears and actually listening to helpful advice will continue to recede. And nobody, least of all the Palestinians, wants that.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-11T08:30:00Z", "title": "Just visiting", "sentences": ["Plus, you can combine activism with sunbathing when in Israel - you can protest against the &quot;apartheid wall&quot; in the morning, and by mid-afternoon be sunning yourself on a Tel Aviv beach with your mates."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/11/sethfreedman2"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "article": "Pardonable Liesby Jacqueline Winspear, read by Julie Maisey (12hrs unabridged, ukaudiobooks.co.uk, \u00a319.95 cassette) Just as I was beginning to despair of finding a lady detective who didn&apos;t sooner or later irritate, alienate, terrify, exasperate or bore me to tears (see Precious Ramotswe, Cordelia Gray, VI Warshawski, Stephanie Plum and Miss Marple), along comes Maisie Dobbs. I haven&apos;t warmed as quickly or as eagerly to a fictional heroine since Flora Poste refurbished Cold Comfort Farm. The good news is that, unlike Flora, a one-book wonder, this is Maisie&apos;s fourth appearance as a sleuth. Her background is as interesting as her cases. At 13 she goes into service, but she&apos;s bright, wins a scholarship to Girton, signs up as a VAD nurse in the Great War and now, 10 years on, sadder and wiser, has her own detective agency. Ideally you should start with the first book, published in audio next week by John Murray, but it&apos;s heavily abridged. I plunged straight into Maisie&apos;s third mystery, featuring a missing first world war pilot and a teenage prostitute accused of murder. The pilot story has overtones of Mary Renault&apos;s classic WWI novel The Charioteer; the rest - mood, period detail, slang and especially the characters - are reminiscent of my favourites: Birdsong, Brideshead Revisited, A Farewell to Arms.

That&apos;s a generous imprimatur from Britain&apos;s commentariat for a first book; no surprise then that Husain is looking quietly pleased. What brings less satisfaction is that on blogs and among many Muslims, he has been condemned as a government stooge, an MI5 agent and even ranked with that small coterie - along with former Dutch MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Irshad Manji, the outspoken Canadian critic of Islam - who are frequently vilified by their fellow Muslims as apostates. Husain, a devout Muslim himself, admits it&apos;s not a &quot;comfortable place&quot; to be but believes the fury is the &quot;price to pay&quot; if dangerous tendencies of Islam in the UK are to be effectively challenged. The fascination of Husain&apos;s book lies in the possibility that his extraordinary personal story of growing up in East London - from Muslim &quot;choirboy&quot; to Hizb ut-Tahrir operative and now to respectable PhD student at the School of Oriental and African Studies - can help to answer two of the most pressing questions about the British Muslim community: what is the appeal of violent jihadi Islam, and how can it be defeated? It helps that the book happened to come out last week, within a few days of the verdicts in the Crevice trial, Britain&apos;s longest running terror trial. Ed Husain, overnight, became one of the experts on what needs to be done to tackle home-grown terrorism. Sitting in Penguin&apos;s offices overlooking the Thames with 32-year-old Husain in his crisp shirt, tweed jacket and neatly pressed jeans, it&apos;s hard to imagine his earlier incarnation as a firebrand with beard, organising recruitment drives for Hizb ut-Tahrir, rallying his forces with vicious condemnation of Jews and homosexuals and self-righteously urging the hijab on the sisterhood. He brushed shoulders with many individuals who went on to become terrorists, such as the British born Tel Aviv bomber Omar Khan Sharif, and Eisa al-Hindi, now in prison in the US - a fate which could have been his. He describes a febrile culture in the early 90s when studious Muslim second generation teenagers felt dislocated from Britain and their parents. Husain rejected the gang culture of his Stepney school and found himself drifting away from the pious Sufi Islam of his parents - to their horror. &quot;I was looking for somewhere to fit in. We were exposed to white working-class culture and it wasn&apos;t comfortable. We may have been poor, but we had middle class values - pyschologically, I felt out of place.&quot; What the rivalrous factions of the radical Muslim youth organisations offered Husain was &quot;dynamism, Englishness and religosity&quot;. He went from one to another, drawn deeper every time into extremism, and finally reached Hizb ut-Tahrir: &quot;We thought we were making a new world. Our job was to mobilise the Muslim masses here. There was that feeling of being on the cusp of a new world order which would revive the glory days of Islam. For a 17-year-old who felt out of place in the UK, it was very attractive. Everywhere we went, we were the brothers to be respected. It was intoxicating.&quot; Husain agrees with Martin Amis that sexual frustration is entangled in the impulse to terrorist glory. He recognised among extremists an &quot;idealisation of marriage. We were always surrounded by men and rarely spoke to women. When we did, we avoided eye contact.&quot; The secrecy and splits, the sense of self-importance: all would be familiar to those in radical left-wing politics in the 60s and 70s. But this form of rebellion developed into something more violent - as we are now aware - and which became clear to Husain when the rhetoric of the campus tipped over into the murder of a Christian Nigerian student in 1995. This incident - and meeting his future wife - triggered his gradual withdrawal from a violent jihadism. Controversially, Husain backs Tony Blair&apos;s analysis, downplaying foreign policy. He argues that Islamism - a body of ideas that aimed radically to reform and politicise Islam in the 20th century in order to confront the west - has come to dominate the British Muslim community, which has failed to challenge the proliferation of forms of violent political Islam; British mosques still have links with Islamist movements from the Asian subcontinent and Middle East, and the aggressive rhetoric towards the west, Jews, and all non-believers was - and, he argues, still is - embedded in many Muslim organisations. Husain argues that government policy has been a disastrous combination of laissez faire and political correctness. It turned a blind eye to Hizb ut-Tahrir, refusing to ban it, unlike countries such as Germany, not recognising how it incubated the mentality that saw some members graduate to terrorism. It patronised Islamist organisations like the Muslim Council of Britain, whose moderation was a mask for entryist tactics. And its policies of multiculturalism encouraged separate communities; multiculturalism was the perfect cover, he argues, for his Hizb ut-Tahrir activities. Even after 9/11 and 7/7, neither the British government nor Muslims themselves are challenging the violent rhetoric, insists Husain, rejecting criticism that his book is already outdated. &quot;A jihadi said to me recently that all the Muslim Brotherhood should be killed because they advocate democracy. Muslims need to challenge this, but they don&apos;t. At a meeting last February on a London university campus, an HT member said that anyone opposing the Caliphate [the idea of a unified Islamic state] should be killed. I walked out, but it&apos;s the same at lots of campuses. I reported HT to one university and they said there was nothing they could do as it was a legal organisation.&quot; Husain points to the declaration (the wording varies) still used in some mosques: &quot;Oh God, bring destruction on the kufr [unbeliever]&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s used less and less in mosques I go to, but will only change completely when people recognise that kufr are our neighbours.&quot; Similar concerns are voiced privately among mainstream Muslims, but Husain is the first to go public. Other Muslims, fearful it will only exacerbate hostility toward Islam, have preferred a strategy of pressure from within. But, Husain counters, they have little to show for their efforts; only pressure from non-Muslims will force the pace of change. He wants Hizb ut-Tahrir banned. He wants disavowals of the writings of key Islamist ideologues, and wants mosques to sever links with extremist Islamist movements abroad. And he seems happy to cheerlead critics of Islam into forcing this agenda through - no wonder he is making enemies. What Husain accepts has changed since the early 90s is that another form of Islam has gained ground. Western converts - such as Americans Hamza Yousef and Nuh Keller, as well as the UK&apos;s Tim Winter - have articulated a more spiritual, less political Islam, while Tariq Ramadan describes an engagement with western societies as citizens, rather than as a Muslim minority pursuing their own interests. There has never been much love lost between Sufism and Islamism - the former criticised as politically quiescent - and one way to read Husain is that Sufi Islam now has a sympathetic hearing in Whitehall and the media, and has the confidence to challenge Islamist domination of the UK Muslim community. One of the book&apos;s shortcomings is its failure to acknowledge that just as Husain has been on a dramatic journey, so have some of the UK&apos;s different expressions of Islamism. It is as if, just as Husain once swallowed large chunks of Hizb ut-Tahrir propaganda, he now seems to have swallowed undigested the prevailing critique of British Muslims. He has no truck with the idea of Islamophobia, which he dismisses as the squeal of an Islamist leadership pleading special favours; he criticises Asian racism and castigates Muslims &quot;who go back home to get married&quot; and produce &quot;another generation confused about home&quot;. On issues such as segregation, he is confident it is the fault of multiculturalism. Husain&apos;s book will be used in many debates - the future of multiculturalism, whether infringements of civil liberties are necessary to combat terrorism, what parts of Islamist histories from Asia and the Middle East a British Muslim community needs to jettison. One suspects the naivety which took him into Hizb-ut Tahrir has blinded him as to how his story will be used to buttress positions hostile to many things he holds dear - his own faith and racial tolerance, for example. A glance at the blog response to a Husain piece in the Telegraph reveals how rightwing racism and anti-Islamic sentiment are feasting on his testimony.  \u00b7 The Islamist by Ed Husain is published by Penguin, \u00a38.99.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-12T22:59:00Z", "title": "Interview: Ed Husain, author of The Islamist", "sentences": ["He brushed shoulders with many individuals who went on to become terrorists, such as the British born Tel Aviv bomber Omar Khan Sharif, and Eisa al-Hindi, now in prison in the US - a fate which could have been his."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/12/religion.news"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Africa"], "article": "Nearly six decades after its creation, Israel occupies a semi-mythical place in the Arab mind. In popular culture, it is the land of brutal occupation, political intrigue, social decadence and sophisticated espionage, with a beautiful or cunning Mossad agent lurking behind every lamppost. Europe once had its Iron Curtain; the Middle East still has its Zion Curtain. Landing in Tel Aviv at an airport called Ben Gurion had all the makings of an Egyptian spy thriller. And for those in search of &quot;intrigue&quot;, my first introduction to Israel did not disappoint. Although Egyptian-born, I was travelling on my Belgian passport. Airport security had obviously been alerted about my imminent arrival and an official welcoming party was waiting when I stepped off the plane. When I left the airport two hours and four interviews later, my first encounter with an Israeli taxi driver confirmed that I had very much landed in the Middle East. He was a Moroccan Jew who had moved to Israel as a teenager and could shame any Cairo cabbie with his colourful use of curses and expletives and his love of Umm Kalthoum, the Arab world&apos;s legendary singing diva. The only western thing about this scene was that he had turned on the taxi&apos;s meter. The Israeli family I stayed with for a few days reminded me in so many ways of home. Like the traditional set-up in Egypt, several generations of the same family live together on the same plot, flowing in and out of each other&apos;s spaces, sharing intimacies, food and resources, etc. The key difference was that they were less patriarchal and more egalitarian than most Egyptian families. &quot;I don&apos;t understand how Europeans can leave home so early and stay so distant from their families,&quot; said an exasperated Zipora, the mother, sounding just like one of my Egyptian aunties, over a sumptuous lunch she had prepared to feed twice the assembled people, just like another of my aunts. Throughout my time in Israel, it was constantly driven home to me that the joking description in Egypt of Israelis as our errant &quot;cousins&quot; had a very distinct ring of truth to it. After all, about half the Jewish population of Israel came from Arab countries - that&apos;s not to mention all the 1.2 million Palestinian holders of Israeli passports. One Iraqi Jew I met in Jerusalem could do a passable imitation of the Egyptian vernacular so popular in films and music across the region, loved travelling to Egypt, was a professional oud player and sang in Arabic at weddings and barmitzvahs. Israelis share with Arabs - particularly their Mediterranean neighbours - a keen sense of Middle Eastern hospitality, a love of conversation and large gatherings and spontaneity in public spaces. But just as Arabs do not realise just how &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; Israelis are, I discovered that Israelis are also largely ignorant of just how &apos;&quot;western&quot; millions of Arabs are. But, then again, in a conflict, it&apos;s tempting to portray your foe as everything you&apos;re not. I found it entertaining that at a barbecue where no one was drinking except me with my solitary glass of wine, everyone seemed convinced that &quot;secular Arab&quot; was some sort of mythical creature, a semantic impossibility. Some guests looked at me with unrestrained dismay when I recalled the amount of drinking that went on at the Cairo parties I used to host or attend. &quot;Do you have alcohol in Egypt?&quot; one confounded guest actually inquired, causing me almost to choke on my wine. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s not the same with the Palestinians,&quot; another confidently asserted. We later drank a toast to his memory at a local bar in Ramallah over the surprisingly good Palestinian beer. The idea that there are sizeable minorities of Egyptians and other Arabs - counting in the millions - committed to secular ideals, gender equality, sexual liberty, etc, was entirely contrary to the vision that most Israelis I met entertained of the Arab world being a seething ocean of Islamic fanaticism. Of course, there are differences, and plenty of them. Whereas a relative minority are socially liberal in Egypt, a relative majority are so in Israel. An openly permissive city like Tel Aviv would be hard to find anywhere in the Middle East, with the exception of Beirut. Another key difference between Egypt and Israel is the sheer diversity of the Israeli population. Egypt&apos;s 75 million citizens are largely homogenous, despite some religious and racial variations. Israel is like a racial microcosm of the world - a fairly unique riot of ethnicities, races and cultures. And the fact that it has succeeded in managing all this diversity to construct a functioning society and a competitive economy is remarkable. Israel also leads the region in science and the knowledge sector. Despite a certain lack of contemporary confidence, Egypt, the oldest nation in the world, has the security of an ages-old identity that has the permanence of the Nile or the pyramids. Whereas Egypt is the land of the rooted, Israel - in contrast - is the land of the displaced controlling millions of dispossessed. Most of the Middle East suffers from a sense of victimhood - in fact, Arabs and Israelis are unified, I discovered, in their belief that they were betrayed by the British. However, the long shadow of the Holocaust and earlier pogroms and the long-standing conflict with the Arabs has transformed this into a full-blown persecution complex and the deep-seated fear that the Arabs cannot be trusted - no matter what they say or do - because what they really want is to drive Israel into the sea. That would partly explain why Israel is the most militarised society I have ever seen and the fact that it often hits first and forgets to ask the right questions later. This immense level of insecurity may confound many of my fellow Arabs because it flies in the face of Israel&apos;s undisputed military might, its ambiguous nuclear arsenal and the fact that it is in occupation of Arab land and not vice-versa. Whereas Israelis do not expect Arabs to lose sleep over the estimated 600 nuclear warheads aimed our way, they are fixated on the suspected nuclear weapons designs of Iran - however remote in the future or unlikely they are to occur. And here lies the biggest potential weapon in the Arab arsenal: militant peace. Arabs should dialogue directly with Israelis and tell them clearly and unequivocally that they want to live alongside them in warm peace once they reach a settlement with the Palestinians and Syrians. Paranoia was the name of the game during the Cold War in Europe. After the Iron Curtain fell, people were confounded that we ever feared the other side so much, especially with many of our former &quot;enemies&quot; now members of the EU.

Long, empty rooms with floors, walls and ceilings lined in smooth, light wood end in glass walls, which let light stream in and reveal the forest outside, the green leaves a startling contrast to the monochrome interior.  www.frauenmuseum.com  The View HouseZermatt, Switzerland Zermatt is the classic mountain village - pictures of its huddled wooden chalets with the Matterhorn looming above have adorned countless million chocolate boxes. But it&apos;s also home to avant-garde artist and architect Heinz Julen, who is single-handedly turning it into the site of some incredible modern design. His first hit was the Vernissage, in the village centre, a cinema/gallery/nightclub with the boho-chic feel of a New York loft. Two years later came the View House, a unique building housing four apartments, all of which you can rent. It looks like a traditional chalet crossed with an industrial greenhouse - lots of timber and vast windows with panoramic views. The price is surprisingly reasonable: each sleeps four and costs from \u00a3165 a night.  Julen&apos;s Zermatt design revolution shows no sign of slowing. His hotel, the Omnia, opened late last year on a hill above town, accessed by an lift through the rock face. But his most ambitious project to date is about to take shape - a 117m pyramid of glass and steel, housing restaurant and rooms, on top of the 3,883m Klein Matterhorn. www.viewhouse.ch; www.heinzjulen.com Aquadome SpaLangenfeld, Austria Modern alpine design is probably easiest to appreciate from the warmth of an infinity pool while admiring the mountain views at one of the incredible spas that have opened in the last couple of years. The Aquadome, surrounded by peaks and just down the valley from Obergurgl, has three outdoor pools suspended above the ground in vast concrete bowls - the idea, say the creators, being to &apos;increase the feeling of weightlessness&apos;. One contains salt water and underwater music, one has massaging water jets, the other turns into a huge whirlpool. www.aqua-dome.at Vigilius Mountain ResortLana, Italy Accessed by its own cable car, the Vigilius guarantees an escape from roads, traffic and noise. Views are of the Dolomites and the air is scented by the larch forest that surrounds the hotel and spa. The building (the work of star architect Matteo Thun) is designed to blend into the forest, thus promoting quiet &apos;observation&apos;. The low-slung structure is clad in long horizontal strips of pale wood, behind which glass walls let in the warmth. It has its own biomass power plant and is carbon neutral. Little surprise then, that this mountain retreat is one of legendary climber Reinhold Messner&apos;s favourite hotels. Doubles from \u00a3210. www.vigilius.it Bergisel Ski JumpInnsbruck, Austria Iraqi-born, London-based superarchitect Zaha Hadid is making her mark on Innsbruck, capital of the Austrian Tirol. First came the Bergisel ski jump, which opened in 2002 and rises out of woods on a hill above the city like a huge, concrete cobra. The good news is that it&apos;s not just ski jumpers who get to appreciate it. At the top of the jump, 40m in the air, is a cafe and viewing platform giving views of the city and the mountains all around. Hadid&apos;s latest work, due for completion this year, is three avant-garde stations for a funicular railway starting in the historic city centre and heading up into the mountains.  www.innsbruck-tourism.at Church of St John the BaptistSwitzerland Just as Lord Foster and a handful of big name designers have shaped the face of modern Britain, so the Alps has its own band of superstar architects. One such is Mario Botta, whose reputation was assured when he rebuilt the 17th-century chapel in the village of Mogno after it was destroyed by an avalanche. Instead of copying what was there before, and to the initial fury of some locals, he created a futuristic tube, made with alternating strips of local grey granite and white marble. From the austere interior visitors&apos; eyes are drawn upwards to the heavens by the light streaming through the sloping glass roof. Touring Switzerland to see other Botta creations could make a great trip - don&apos;t miss his Tour de Moron (like a futuristic tower of Pisa) in the Jura, and Santa Maria degli Angeli on Mount Tamaro, near Lugano. www.botta.ch Mpreis SupermarketWenns, Austria Forget identikit out-of-town warehouses, in Austria, even the supermarkets are cool. Mpreis bills itself as &apos;the seriously sexy supermarket&apos;. This has nothing to do with its products, but is because each of the 130 stores are designed by up and coming architects, and are even becoming tourist attractions. Most famous is the shop perched half-way up a mountain outside the small town of Wenns, but you&apos;ll see them throughout the Austrian Alps.  www.mpreis.at Therme ValsGraubunden, Switzerland The other giant of alpine design is Peter Zumthor, who has been dubbed &apos;the mystic of the mountains&apos;. The rich from around the world clamour to employ him but he has completed only a handful of buildings in his 40-year career and only started working outside his home canton, Graubunden, in 1997, in his mid-50s. Zumthor&apos;s masterpiece is the spa at Vals, where vast clean walls of concrete and quartzite contrast with the alpine meadows outside. Being inside, say architecture critics, is like being in a series of geometric caves. Swimming between them, in the spa&apos;s various pools, is, says one, &apos;a profoundly moving experience&apos;. www.therme-vals.ch Kunsthaus BregenzBregenz, Austria If the Vorarlberg is the planet&apos;s most progressive area for architecture, the focal point must be the art gallery in the region&apos;s capital, Bregenz. Another Zumthor creation, it&apos;s a large glass and steel cube standing on the shores of Lake Constance. Zumthor says it resembles a lamp, absorbing and reflecting the changing light of the sky and reflections from the lake. For a guide to the area&apos;s other highlights, from a modernist apres-ski hut in Lech, to an office building in Fussach that seems to float in mid-air, see www.vorarlberg-tourism.at. Esserhof HotelLana, Italy Many of the new alpine buildings incorporate environmentally friendly features, but the Esserhof takes this to extremes, being almost entirely built of straw, wood and clay. The straw insulation means it uses a tiny amount of electricity, but the eco-values don&apos;t get in the way of the chic design. There are three minimalist apartments, each with a glass wall looking out over the terrace and gardens. They sleep up to four, but based on two staying cost from \u00a334 per person per night.  www.esserhof.com Kirchner MuseumDavos, Switzerland The artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner lived in Davos from 1917 until his death in 1938, and the town&apos;s Kirchner Museum holds the world&apos;s largest collection of his work. But although he was a key influence on German expressionism, many visitors seem more interested in the building. Designed by Annette Gigon and Mike Guyer from Zurich, it has become a place of pilgrimage for architecture students and is made up of several cubes, clad in matt or shining plates of glass with varying degrees of transparency. Davos has another star design attraction up its sleeve too - Herzog and de Meuron (of Tate Modern fame) have designed a 105m tower that twists as it rises above the Schatzalp, a mountain shelf above the town.  www.kirchnermuseum.ch Tschuggen SpaArosa, Switzerland Since his chapel at Mogno, Mario Botta has designed Evry Cathedral in France, the Cymbalista Synagogue in Tel Aviv and the Santo Volto Church in Turin, and he brings something of the sacred to this new spa - the result is closer to a cathedral than a leisure centre. Tall steel and glass skylights project from the roof like the bows of upturned boats, echoing the mountain peaks beyond and looking like arched church windows, particularly at night when the light shines out from them. Inside, Duke White granite from Italy covers walls, floors and the pool. &apos;The person who visits a spa doesn&apos;t go only for a workout or the pool,&apos; says Botta. &apos;He wants an environment that also nourishes the spirit.&apos; The spa is closed this summer, but will be open year round from December. www.tschuggen.ch FlaineFrance 15 While Austria and Switzerland find themselves at design&apos;s cutting edge, the French have gone oddly quiet. Perhaps this is a reaction to their unrestrained championing of modern mountain design in the 1960s and 70s. Many of those futuristic ski resorts, such as Tignes and Les Menuires, later became derided for their &apos;ugly&apos; concrete towers, and many buildings have been demolished or clad in wood to soften the effect. Flaine, though, designed by Marcel Breuer, remains gloriously intact and gives a fascinating glimpse of 1960s futurism. The whole resort is built of concrete and looks more like a space station than an alpine village, while sculptures by Picasso and Dubuffet adorn the ski school meeting area.  www.flaine.fr \u00b7 Click here to see our Alpine design slideshow", "publicationDate": "2007-05-13T19:39:00Z", "title": "High style in the Alps", "sentences": ["www.kirchnermuseum.ch Tschuggen SpaArosa, Switzerland Since his chapel at Mogno, Mario Botta has designed Evry Cathedral in France, the Cymbalista Synagogue in Tel Aviv and the Santo Volto Church in Turin, and he brings something of the sacred to this new spa - the result is closer to a cathedral than a leisure centre."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/13/escape.architecture"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Politics"], "article": "As the trap closes in on him, and the cat looms behind, the mouse in Kafka&apos;s short story &quot;A Little Fable&quot; says: &quot;Alas ... the world is growing narrower every day.&quot; After many years of living in the violent reality of a political, military and religious conflict, I can report, sadly, that Kafka&apos;s mouse was right: the world is, indeed, growing increasingly narrow, increasingly diminished, with each passing day. An empty space is growing, ever so slowly, between each individual and the violent, chaotic situation in which he lives. The situation that dictates his life to him. This space never remains empty. It becomes filled - with apathy, cynicism and despair; the despair that fuels distorted situations, allowing them to persist, in some cases for generations. I feel the heavy toll that I, and the people I see and know around me, pay for this ongoing state of war. The shrinking of the &quot;surface area&quot; of the soul that comes into contact with the violent and menacing world. The limiting of one&apos;s ability - and willingness - to identify, even a little, with the pain of others; the suspension of moral judgment. The despair most of us experience of possibly understanding our own true thoughts, in a state of affairs that is so terrifying and deceptive and complex. Perhaps, I have sometimes wondered, I might be better off not thinking and not knowing, better off leaving the task of establishing moral norms to those who, supposedly, &quot;know better&quot;. At such times, maybe I am better off developing a useful numbness, protecting myself as best I can with the help of a bit of indifference, a bit of sublimation, a bit of intended blindness, and large doses of self-anaesthetization. Because of the perpetual - and all-too-real - fear of being hurt, or of death, or of unbearable loss, or even of &quot;mere&quot; humiliation, each and every one of us, the conflict&apos;s citizens, its prisoners, trim down our own vivacity, enveloping ourselves with protective layers, which end up suffocating us. Kafka&apos;s mouse is right: when a predator is closing in on you, the world does indeed become increasingly narrow. So does the language that describes it. The language with which the citizens of a sustained conflict describe their predicament becomes progressively shallower the longer the conflict endures. Language gradually becomes a sequence of clich\u00e9s and slogans. This process begins with the language created by the institutions that run the conflict directly - the army, the police, the different government ministries; it quickly filters through to the mass media reporting the conflict, germinating an even more cunning language, aiming to tell its target audience the story most easily digested; and the process ultimately seeps into the private, intimate language of the conflict&apos;s citizens, even if they deny or are unaware that this is happening. The natural riches of language remind us incessantly of the bountiful reality of which we are being robbed, of its true complexity, its subtleties. The more this state of affairs appears insoluble, and as the language used to describe the conflict grows shallower, what remain are the mutual accusations between enemies, or between political adversaries within the same country. What remain are the clich\u00e9s we use for describing our enemy and ourselves; the clich\u00e9s that are, ultimately, a collection of superstitions and crude generalisations, in which we capture ourselves and entrap our enemies. The world, indeed, grows increasingly narrow. In so many parts of the world today, billions of people face a &quot;situation&quot; of one type or other in which personal existence, and values, liberty and identity, are under threat. Almost each and every one of us has a &quot;situation&quot; of our own, a curse of our own. Each and every one of us feels - or can intuit - how our special &quot;situation&quot; can rapidly turn into a trap that would take away our freedom, the sense of home our country provides, our private language, our free will. In this reality, authors and poets write. In Israel and Palestine, Chechnya and Sudan, in New York and in the Congo. Sometimes, during my working day, after several hours&apos; writing, I lift up my head and think - right now, at this very moment, another writer whom I don&apos;t even know sits, in Damascus or Tehran, in Rwanda or Dublin, just like me, practising this peculiar, Quixote-like craft of creation, within a reality that contains so much violence and estrangement, indifference and diminution. In this pursuit, I have a distant ally, who doesn&apos;t even know me, but together we weave an intangible web, which nevertheless has tremendous power, a world-changing and world-creating power, the power of making the dumb speak. In recent years, I turned my back, in writing fiction, on the immediate, fiery reality of my country, that of the latest news bulletin. I have written books about this reality before, and in some years I never stopped writing about it, and never stopped trying to understand it, in articles and essays and interviews. I participated in dozens of protests, in international peace initiatives. I met my neighbours - some of whom were my enemies - whenever there was an opportunity for dialogue. So why did I decide, in recent years, almost out of protest, not to write about these disaster zones? Because I wanted to write about other things, equally important, which do not take up people&apos;s time and emotion, and attract their undivided attention, when the nearly eternal war thunders. I wrote about the furious jealousy of a man for his wife, about homeless children on the streets of Jerusalem, about a man and a woman who establish a private language of their own, hermetic almost, within a delusional bubble of love. I wrote about the solitude of Samson, the biblical hero, and about the fine and intricate relations between women and their mothers, and in general - between parents and their children. But about four years ago, when my second-oldest son, Uri, was to join the army, a sense of urgency and alarm washed over me, leaving me restless. I then began writing a novel that treats directly the bleak reality in which I live. A novel that depicts how external violence and a military reality penetrate the tender and vulnerable tissue of a single family, ultimately tearing it asunder. &quot;As soon as one writes,&quot; Natalia Ginzburg says in It Is Hard to Talk About Yourself, &quot;one miraculously ignores the current circumstances of one&apos;s life, yet our happiness or misery leads us to write in a certain way. When we&apos;re happy - our imagination is more dominant. When miserable - the power of our memory takes over.&quot; It is hard to write about oneself, particularly when it comes to such matters. I can only say where I am at this point in time. In the wake of the death of my son Uri last summer, in the war between Israel and Lebanon, the power of memory is indeed enormous and heavy, and at times has a paralysing quality. Nevertheless, the act of writing itself at this time creates for me a space, a mindset that I&apos;ve never experienced before, where death is not only the absolute, one-dimensional negation of life. When I write I feel the world move, flexible, crammed with possibilities. It certainly isn&apos;t frozen. Wherever human existence permeates, there is no freezing and no paralysis and, actually, there is no status quo - even if we sometimes think mistakenly that there is a status quo; even if some are very keen to have us believe that a status quo exists. When I write, even now, the world is not closing in on me, and it does not grow ever so narrow: it makes gestures of opening up. I write. I imagine. The act of imagining in itself enlivens me. I am not frozen and paralysed before the predator. I write. I invent characters. At times I feel as though I am digging up people from the ice in which reality enshrouded them, but maybe, more than anything else, it is my self that I am now digging up. I feel the wealth of possibilities inherent in any human situation. I sense my ability to choose between them, which I believed I had lost. I indulge in the richness of true, personal, intimate language. I recall the delight of natural, full breathing when I manage to escape the claustrophobia of slogan and clich\u00e9. Suddenly I begin to breathe with both lungs. I write, and I feel how the correct and precise use of words is sometimes like a cure to an illness, a way to give me back the person I used to be, me, before my Self became nationalised and confiscated by the conflict, by governments and armies, by despair and tragedy. I deny myself one of the dubious and distinctive capacities of the state of war in which I live - the capacity to be an enemy, and an enemy only. I do my best not to shield myself from the justness and sufferings of my enemy. Nor from the tragedy and entanglement of his own life. Nor from his errors or crimes and not from the knowledge of what I myself am doing to him. And not from the surprising similarities I find between him and me. All of a sudden I am not condemned to this absolute, fallacious and suffocating dichotomy - this inhumane choice of &quot;be victim or aggressor&quot;, without having any third, more humane alternative. When I write, I feel close to my enemies&apos; sufferings and justness, without relinquishing a grain of my own identity. Sometimes when I write, I can recall what we all felt in Israel, for one singular moment, when the plane of the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat landed in Tel Aviv after decades of war between the two nations: then, all of a sudden, we discovered how heavy is the load we carry all our lives - the load of enmity and fear and suspicion. The load of the permanent guarding duty, the heavy burden of being an enemy, at all times. And what a delight it was, to remove for one moment the mighty armour of suspicion, hate and stereotype, and witness a human face emerge from this single-dimensional vision with which we observed one another for years. I write. I give my names to an external and foreign world. In a sense, I make it mine. I return from feeling exiled and foreign to the feeling of Home. By that I am already making a small change in what appeared to me earlier as unchangeable. Also, when I describe the most impermeable arbitrariness that signs my destiny - arbitrariness at the hands of a human, or arbitrariness at the hands of fate - I suddenly discover new nuances, subtleties. I discover that the mere act of writing about arbitrariness allows me to feel a freedom of movement in relation to it. That by merely facing up to arbitrariness I am granted freedom - maybe the only freedom a man may have against any arbitrariness - the freedom to put one&apos;s tragedy into one&apos;s own words. And I write also about that which cannot be brought back. And about that which is inconsolable. Then, too, in a manner I still find inexplicable, the circumstances of my life do not close in on me in a way that would leave me paralysed. I cannot grasp how this miracle works. Maybe once I finish writing this novel, I will try to understand. Not now. It is too early. And I write the life of my land, Israel. The land that is tortured, frantic, drugged by a historical overdose, excessive emotions uncontainable by human capacity, excessive extremity of events and tragedy, excessive anxiety and paralysing sobriety, excessive memory, failed hopes, circumstances of a fate unique among all nations; of existence, which sometimes appears to be a story of mythical proportions, a story that is &quot;larger than life&quot; to the point that something went wrong with the relation it bears to life itself; tired of the possibility of ever leading a normal life of a country among countries, a nation among nations. We writers go through times of despair and times of self-doubt. Our work is in essence the work of deconstructing personality, of doing away with cunning defence mechanisms. Our work leads us time and again to acknowledge our shortcomings, as both humans and artists. And yet, and this is the great mystery and the alchemy of our actions: in a sense, as soon as we lay our hands on the pen, or the computer keyboard, we already cease to be the helpless victim of whatever it was that enslaved and diminished us: not of our predicament and not of our private anxieties; not of the &quot;official narrative&quot; of our country, nor of fate itself. We write. The world is not closing in on us. How fortunate are we. The world is not growing increasingly narrow.  \u00b7 This is an edited extract from David Grossman&apos;s Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture, PEN World Voices Festival.

The fresh injury problem threatens to upset Steve McClaren&apos;s plans for England&apos;s critical Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia and Friday&apos;s Wembley friendly against Brazil. The Manchester United defender is waiting on a scan to explore the extent of the damage but the player fears he will not be available to travel to Estonia for the must-win match on June 6. In a 10-a-side game during England training at Arsenal&apos;s London Colney centre yesterday, the \u00a330m centre-half&apos;s place was taken by Jamie Carragher. The Liverpool vice-captain looks set to partner the England captain, John Terry, against Brazil, a fixture that seems too soon for Ferdinand. With Middlesbrough&apos;s Jonathan Woodgate having required cartilage surgery after the end of the Premiership season, Ferdinand&apos;s problem explains why McClaren was so anxious to name the Tottenham Hotspur centre-halves Ledley King and Michael Dawson in his 26-man squad. Neither trained yesterday and were said to be warming down at the team hotel but both impressed during England B&apos;s 3-1 win over Albania last week and are expected to be available for selection this Friday. Even so, the defensive problems come at the wrong time for McClaren, since England&apos;s Euro 2008 qualification hopes rest on a knife edge - after six games they lie fourth in Group E. However, the England manager may draw confidence from the fact that Estonia have yet to score in the five matches they have played during the campaign, all of which ended in defeat. There were other clues about how McClaren might set up his side in the forthcoming international fixtures. With Chelsea&apos;s Ashley Cole recovering from surgery on an ankle injury, the Reading player Nicky Shorey appears set to win a first full cap at left-back as he featured in England&apos;s &quot;A&quot; line-up in training yesterday. Shorey was another who won plaudits for his performance in the England B win last week, but is unlikely he will displace Chelsea&apos;s Wayne Bridge from the starting line-up and is expected to play only as a substitute. Up front were Manchester United&apos;s Alan Smith and Newcastle United&apos;s Michael Owen, who formed the forward line against Albania at Turf Moor. The former, who was a goal scorer last Friday, may not survive into the final reckoning, however, since Peter Crouch is favoured to start against Brazil. The Liverpool striker was rested from yesterday&apos;s training session following his club&apos;s run to the Champions League final. David Beckham returned to his first training session of the McClaren era on the right of a familiar-looking midfield alongside Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole. Beckham, who has stated that he expects to prolong his England career despite his commitment to quit Europe for LA Galaxy in July, showed he harbours no ill feeling towards the man who limited his international opportunities. His first pass of the training session was to McClaren. In a sign that Beckham&apos;s profile continues to predominate - which was a factor in his omission from McClaren&apos;s previous England squads - Real Madrid have been forced to cancel their \u00a315m summer tour of the United States because the Americans are not prepared to watch a side that does not include David Beckham. Madrid tried to cash in on Beckham while they could by squeezing in a postseason US tour before the Englishman&apos;s Bernab\u00e9u contract expires, rather than organising their normal pre-season tour in August. They planned to depart for Israel and the US immediately after the close of the domestic season on June 17, but those plans have been scrapped because Beckham is unwilling to play ball. Having cancelled their US tour, Madrid had hoped that even though Beckham refused to join the squad in the States he would play against a combined Israeli- Palestinian team in Tel Aviv on June 19, only to be told that he will not travel to the Middle East either. Although Beckham&apos;s Real Madrid contract does not expire until June 31, he has a holiday planned at the end of the season before flying to the US to join up with new club LA Galaxy in mid-July. And, still irritated by Madrid&apos;s failure to consult the players over the tour and the club&apos;s petulant reaction to his decision to leave for the MLS, he is not prepared to alter his plans.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-28T23:25:55Z", "title": "Ferdinand a doubt for England", "sentences": ["Having cancelled their US tour, Madrid had hoped that even though Beckham refused to join the squad in the States he would play against a combined Israeli- Palestinian team in Tel Aviv on June 19, only to be told that he will not travel to the Middle East either."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/29/newsstory.sport7"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ehud Barak"], "article": "Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak won the first round of elections for leadership of the Labour party but must now face a run-off against his strongest challenger, Ami Ayalon, a political newcomer and former security services chief.

He has argued that he is best placed to face a future challenge from Binyamin Netanyahu, whose Likud party is a long way ahead in the current political opinion polls. &quot;I tell voters only two things: I tell them to think about who they want more in a time of war, and I tell them that only with me heading our team can we beat Netanyahu,&quot; Mr Barak said yesterday after casting his vote in Kfar Saba, near Tel Aviv. Mr Ayalon, however, has only been an MP for a year. Previously he was chief of the navy and head of the Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s domestic security agency. Opinion polls in the run-up to yesterday&apos;s vote suggested that he would win in a run-off against Mr Barak. &quot;I think many people understand that we are, in fact, not just voting on the future of the Labour party but to a very large extent on the future leadership of the state of Israel,&quot; Mr Ayalon said yesterday.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-29T22:57:10Z", "title": "Israeli Labour party set for leadership run-off", "sentences": ["&quot;I tell voters only two things: I tell them to think about who they want more in a time of war, and I tell them that only with me heading our team can we beat Netanyahu,&quot; Mr Barak said yesterday after casting his vote in Kfar Saba, near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/29/israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Four Israeli university presidents and several high-profile authors today called on the Israeli government to lift its restrictions on Palestinian students.

In a nation of seven million inhabitants, the Russian influx represents a sizeable percentage of the population - a fact that many commentators and politicians find hard to swallow, regardless of the nature of the country&apos;s constitution. The Jewish right of return to Israel is a veritable Pandora&apos;s Box which, once opened, is near impossible to slam shut again, however much the sabras complain. After all, the entire Zionist enterprise was founded on the inalienable rights of Jews to live in the land of Israel - so it is a bit rich for the original immigrants now to complain about the latter-day arrivals who show up on these shores. In Hitler&apos;s eyes, a Jew was a person with at least one Jewish grandparent - hence the State of Israel&apos;s benevolence extends to anyone with the same credentials nowadays. This relaxed definition of Jewishness (one Jewish grandparent - unless the maternal grandmother - doesn&apos;t qualify a person as Jewish in the eyes of Israel&apos;s religious authorities) has meant that accusations of freeloading and jumping on the bandwagon have been levelled at various groups of immigrants over the last 20 years - especially those from Ethiopia and Russia. For someone like me, hailing from a part of the Diaspora where official documents are methodically compiled and stored, it was easy for the Jewish Agency to determine whether I was Jewish when I made aliyah three years ago. However, ascertaining the ethnic status of those from Russia and Ethiopia has proved far harder for the authorities, and inevitably there has been widespread abuse of the system. The deluge of immigrants from Russia in particular has resulted in some bizarre stories in the Israeli media - such as the perennial stories of anti-semitic soldiers in the IDF. For my part, I served with a Ukrainian boy who requested home leave over Christmas since his family were orthodox Christians, and thus he needed to be excused from the army on religious grounds. Even more sinister, in terms of Israeli politics, is the suggestion that the influence of the Russian community in Israel has led to the election of right wing politicians who would not previously have commanded sufficient votes to enter the Knesset. I took one of the leaders of ICAHD to task for just such an assertion, believing it to be a thinly veiled example of racism:  &quot;Israel is swinging to the right &apos;because of the Russians&apos;, she stated. Apparently, the one million Russian Jews who have emigrated to Israel are the root cause of the problem - them, and the &apos;mafia money that is flooding the country - Lev Leviev, Gaydamak, and so on&apos;. It&apos;s a new angle, granted, blaming an entire ethnic sub-group for the intransigence of the rightwing, for the settlement expansions, for the whole awful mess.&quot;  For a group of people so often maligned and mistreated on account of their religion, I found it amazing that Jews could suddenly categorise a sub-group in this way - but there is perhaps some truth in the claim, however unpalatable. Discontent and suspicion is growing on the Israeli streets with regards to their recently-arrived Russian neighbours, and, in return, Russian community leaders are urging their compatriots to fight back. Arkadi Gaydamak, the shadowy Russian-born oligarch who has burst on to the Israeli political scene in recent years, last week gave the following comment to the Jerusalem Post:  &quot;The reiterated &apos;one million&apos; assertion is aimed at lowering the level of the self-determination of the community, so as not to let them figure out that they are really a majority.&quot;  His words prompted speculation that he may try his hand at uniting the Russian community in Israel and empowering them further in local government and the Knesset. He is a force to be reckoned with - for the current government, at least. His magnanimous gestures over the past 12 months have made a mockery of the cabinet&apos;s apparent impotence when crisis has struck the country. During last summer&apos;s war in the North, Gaydamak built a &quot;tent-city&quot; on the beach of Nitzanim to house thousands of refugees from the Katyusha-hit towns near the Lebanese border. He openly criticised the government&apos;s inaction in dealing with the refugees - and he has repeated the trick again by building a similar compound in Tel Aviv for residents of Kassam-struck Sderot. He intends to run in the upcoming mayoral elections in Jerusalem - a city which has already benefited from his largesse, after his millions helped Betar Jerusalem capture its first Premier League football championship in 10 years. He is viewed with a mixture of scorn and suspicion by the media and ruling elite alike - with some even speculating that he is an agent for Moscow - but he brushes off the criticism with ease. He is, for the present, not nailing his colours to any particular political mast, contenting himself with self-publicity and becoming a household name. If the Russian community continues to be similarly sidelined and ignored by the &quot;native&quot; populace, it is likely that they will end up cleaving to whoever proclaims himself their saviour - be that Gaydamak or any other similar character. Avigdor Lieberman is another political figure who has utilised the dissatisfaction of certain elements of Israeli society, including the Russian community, to raise his political profile. The leader of the rightwing Yisrael Beytenu party, he has served as a deputy prime minister of Israel since signing a coalition agreement with Ehud Olmert in late 2006. His party swept into the Knesset in last year&apos;s elections, gaining 11 of the 120 seats on a largely anti-Arab ticket. His Caucasian roots gave him access to the Russian community who, in turn, rallied behind his warrior-like call for tougher measures against the Palestinians and Israel&apos;s neighbouring countries. This is the same man who is quoted as saying something along the lines of Israeli Arabs &quot;should take their packages and go to hell&quot; - a sentiment that apparently influenced his infamous &quot;population exchange plan&quot;, which called for repatriating Israel&apos;s Arab populace. If, as it appears, the Russian community can be manipulated by the likes of Gaydamak and Lieberman, then the omens for the wishes of the rest of the country are not good. In order to counter the actions of those who know how to play this particular disenfranchised sector of society, it is time that the other parties build bridges with their Russian neighbours. If not, they will slip from their grasp as parties like Yisrael Beytenu tighten their grip.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-31T07:00:00Z", "title": "Building bridges", "sentences": ["He openly criticised the government&apos;s inaction in dealing with the refugees - and he has repeated the trick again by building a similar compound in Tel Aviv for residents of Kassam-struck Sderot."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/31/buildingbridges"}, {"tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "Israeli academics believe the boycott proposed by the University and College Union would harm the people it aims to help and would damage the work their universities are doing to foster links with Palestinian universities and improve conditions for Palestinian students. The president of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Prof Menachem Magidor, said Wednesday&apos;s vote by union members to back calls from Palestinian trade unions for a boycott was morally wrong, and wondered what effect it would have on the &quot;active co-operation&quot; his university fosters with Palestinian universities. Earlier this year, the university, which opened in 1925 and whose governors included Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber, protested the army&apos;s decision to deny a Palestinian student a permit to go the university. Sawsan Salameh was studying a for doctorate in chemistry when the army refused her request to travel a few miles from her home in Anata, east Jerusalem to the university campus. Palestinian students can attend Palestinian universities in the West Bank, but often they have to travel for hours to cover a short distance to get past checkpoints and walls. Hours before the UCU vote, four Israeli university presidents wrote to Amir Peretz, Israel&apos;s defence minister, asking that he remove a ban on students from Gaza studying in the West Bank. &quot;In recent years, the security authorities have instituted a policy which prevents residents of Gaza from traveling to the West Bank for the purpose of studies in Palestinian institutions of higher education located there&quot;, even though &quot;essential professions such as medicine, occupational therapy [and] speech therapy may only be studied in the West Bank and are not available in Gaza,&quot; the letter stated. &quot;Blocking access to higher education for Palestinian students from Gaza who choose to study in the West Bank casts a dark shadow over Israel&apos;s image as a state which respects and supports the principle of academic freedom and the right to education,&quot; it concluded. Israel has eight universities and several smaller colleges. Most Israeli academic staff have had some connection with UK institutions at some point in their careers. Although it is a small country with a population of 7 million, Israel&apos;s universities perform well in international academic league tables. The Times Higher Education Supplement ranked the Hebrew University of Jerusalem 29th in world, Tel Aviv University 35th and the Israel Institute of Technology joint 39th in its international league table, excluding American and European institutions. In arts and humanities, including American and European colleges, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was ranked 43rd and Tel Aviv University 87th. In science the Israel Institute of Technology was ranked 50th and the Hebrew University 52nd. Occupied territories One of Israel&apos;s most controversial colleges is the College of Judea and Samaria, which is located in the West Bank settlement of Ariel. Critics say that the existence of the settlement and the college on land taken during the Six Day War in 1967 is illegal under international law and perpetrates the divisions between Palestinians and Israelis. The college has around 10,000 students, of whom over 300 are Arab. The Arab students come from either Israel or East Jerusalem but none come from the West Bank where the college is situated. Dan Meyerstein, the president of the college, said that he felt it was important to listen to people&apos;s opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he added: &quot;I feel that many of the people involved in this boycott have little knowledge of the system here and those that do have knowledge also have the desire to abolish the state of Israel.&quot; &quot;I have always felt boycotts were a bit like burning books. This happened in Europe 70 years ago and it is part of the reason I live in Israel.&quot; He said there was a great potential for a boycott to affect Israeli academic life. &quot;Science is an international discipline. If you do not publish you are not there. If you do not attend conferences, you are not there,&quot; he said. However, he added: &quot;My experience of boycotts is that they rarely amount to anything. &quot;The last time this issue erupted two years ago, I don&apos;t think it led to any scientist of real standing in the UK doing anything bad to an Israeli scientist. The same week they voted for a boycott two years ago, one of my colleagues was invited for a sabbatical at Cambridge University.&quot; Prof Magidor said he did not think a boycott would have a major practical effect. &quot;We have a very lively exchange with UK universities which benefits both sides. There are no formal connections but there is a lot of joint research and visits on both sides.&quot; &quot;The institutions we deal with such as Cambridge, Oxford and Imperial College are not in favour of a boycott so it would make little difference.&quot; At the University of Haifa, around 20% of the students are Arabs, mostly from the city and its surrounding villages and towns. Aharon Ben-Ze&apos;ev, the university&apos;s president, said that its model of co-existence was more likely to bring about political change than boycotts, which could cause the situation to deteriorate. &quot;This is the only place in the world where 3,000 Arabs study with 13,000 Jews. In spite of the second intifada and the second Lebanon war, studying and co-existence have continued,&quot; he said. &quot;We have achieved such a huge success in building a model for relations between a majority and a minority. &quot;This is the way to combat the problems in the Middle East, solving the day-to-day problems, co-operating, living together. This is the way to force politicians on both sides to get together.&quot; Prof Ben-Ze&apos;ev said that a boycott would damage the university but make no contribution to peace. &quot;If a boycott is wholly imposed, of course it will hurt the university. It will especially hurt the young people as they have yet to establish connections around the world and prove themselves. More established people have less to prove and they have already made their connection,&quot; he said. The union&apos;s proposal also seemed to reflect double standards, he added. &quot;It&apos;s an immoral decision in the extreme. I expect academics to take a perspective when they make a decision especially if it has a moral side to it. I don&apos;t see this at all. If people want to bring happiness and morality all over the world then please make a list of countries and an order of priorities but this is only directed at Israel,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-01T10:39:53Z", "title": "Israel's universities react to the academic boycott vote", "sentences": ["The Times Higher Education Supplement ranked the Hebrew University of Jerusalem 29th in world, Tel Aviv University 35th and the Israel Institute of Technology joint 39th in its international league table, excluding American and European institutions.", "In arts and humanities, including American and European colleges, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was ranked 43rd and Tel Aviv University 87th."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/01/highereducation.uk1"}, {"tags": [], "article": "In the Arab neighbourhoods of Ramla everyone knew Hamda&apos;s days were numbered. Her name was on a blacklist of women whose behaviour upset the gangs in Jawarish, one of the poorest parts of this ill-famed suburb of Tel Aviv. Since 2000, seven women belonging to the Abu Ghanem clan had already been murdered for reasons as trifling as their refusal to accept an arranged marriage, or for a smile exchanged with a man in the street. Hamda Abu Ghanem, 19, was the eighth victim. In January the police found her body riddled with bullets at her parents&apos; home. She was reportedly punished for talking on the phone to her cousin. Much as Naifa, Suzan, Zinat, Sabrin, Amira, Reem and Shirihan before her, Hamda was the victim of an &quot;honour&quot; killing, to wash away the supposed affront to her family&apos;s reputation. About 10 Arab Israeli women die every year, falling foul of a tradition that also persists in the Occupied Territories. &quot;Such crimes used to be justified by accusations of extramarital sex,&quot; says Aida Touma-Suliman of Women Against Violence, an NGO based in Nazareth. &quot;But with women living in an increasingly open environment, thanks in particular to longer studies, some men feel more threatened. Taking a harmless liberty may be seen as a major challenge to their authority.&quot; In a survey of Israel&apos;s Arab community in 2005 a third of those polled said they could &quot;understand&quot; honour killings. But Hamda&apos;s death marks a turning point, finally breaching the conspiracy of silence in Ramla. The veil of fear and tacit consent that once covered such acts has been torn apart. &quot;Usually when we get to the scene of a crime it looks as if nothing has happened,&quot; says Yifrach Duchovny, the local police commander. &quot;There is no sign of any blood. Everything has been cleaned up and the father can walk past the body of his daughter without displaying the slightest emotion. And by some odd coincidence none of the victim&apos;s relatives have seen or heard anything.&quot; With no witnesses, charges were brought for only one of the seven previous murders. But after the latest killing about 20 women agreed to help the police. Hamda&apos;s brother has been arrested for her murder. &quot;Things have gone too far,&quot; says Samah Aghbariya, who runs a women&apos;s social centre in Ramla. &quot;This crime was so wrong. Everyone knew Hamda was innocent. The women were very upset and decided there had been enough killing.&quot; &quot;The Israelis like to think they have established a more enlightened government here,&quot; says Touma-Suliman. &quot;Unlike the criminal law in force in the Occupied Territories [which punishes honour killings with a very short prison sentence] Israeli law takes murder seriously. The welfare network, albeit inadequate, provides better coverage too. But at the same time the dispossession and poverty we have endured since Israel was established encourages our leaders to hang on to their last scrap of authority, governing the family. With no influence over the larger political arena, they are reduced to defending social and cultural values, holding up the change in standards we sorely need. &quot;It is too easy to lay all the blame for this crime on a conspiracy of silence. At the end of the 1990s we gave the Ramla police station a list of women at risk. No one paid any attention and five of them have been killed.&quot; Touma-Suliman maintains that the Israeli police and legal system, even the media, have a blinkered attitude to honour killing. &quot;They are convinced that the murder of a Jewish woman is a criminal act, whereas when Arabs kill their womenfolk it is just part of their culture. But the truth of the matter in Jawarish is much more complex. The killers are delinquents, often with a long criminal record. Eliminating the women is one way of keeping control over their territory. If the police had made any serious attempt to stop drug trafficking, for example, some of these crimes could have been avoided.&quot; A case in point is the murder of Reem Abu Ghanem in March 2006. She had run away from her parents&apos; home with her lover to escape an arranged marriage. Subsequently she agreed to go home after her brothers signed an undertaking not to do her any harm. Only a few days later she was drugged, strangled and dumped in a well. &quot;It was bound to happen,&quot; says Touma-Suliman with a sigh. &quot;Why did the police send her home?&quot; Aghbariya emphasises the shortage of social workers in the Arab quarters. &quot;There are only four of us, serving a population of 18,000,&quot; she says. &quot;This problem is obviously not a priority for the authorities. But anyway it is only a part of the solution. We need to establish closer links between our community and government bodies. Above all we need to do a lot more to improve education and public awareness.&quot; In March, Aghbariya organised a meeting for police, teachers, social workers and even the sheikh from the mosque. There is no time to lose. Everyone agrees that the killers are determined to silence the women who spoke out. The main prosecution witness disappeared a few weeks ago. The people of Jawarish fear that she may already be the Abu Ghanem clan&apos;s ninth victim.

David Ofek&apos;s 2003 film is about a suicide attack on a bus near Tel Aviv in which 17 people died; only 16 of the victims, however, were identified by the police. &apos;It was very striking,&apos; she says. &apos;Usually, people hear about a bomb, they worry, they come forward to claim their relatives. But no one came forward to claim this one. So the director decided to try and find out who number 17 was. He put an ad in a newspaper and a few people called him. One of them was a father who didn&apos;t know where his son was. It seemed to me that this man wanted his son to have been in the attack not because he wanted him to be dead, but because he needed an answer - a solution.&apos; This got her thinking. It reminded her of a time before she was married, when a guy she was dating suddenly stopped calling her. &apos;It happens to every girl, but I couldn&apos;t understand it and, at a certain point, I thought: well, maybe he&apos;s dead.&apos; She laughs. &apos;Then I called him and, of course, he wasn&apos;t dead at all. This was the beginning of the idea - of a girl who imagines that her boyfriend is dead rather than believe that he has dumped her.&apos; The result is Exit Wounds, the most gripping graphic novel of the year. It tells the story of Koby, a Tel Aviv taxi driver whose estranged father, Gabriel, has disappeared, and Numi, a woman who, unbeknown to him, was formerly his father&apos;s lover. Numi tries to convince Koby that Gabriel died in suicide attack in a Hadera bus station - she has seen a scarf she knitted for him in the news coverage - and, together, they set out to discover the uncomfortable truth. The book has already been widely acclaimed. &apos;There&apos;s no question that Exit Wounds places Rutu Modan in the top tier of cartoonists working today,&apos; says Joe Sacco, cartoonist of Palestine and Safe Area Gorazde. &apos;A story that will tear up your hearts,&apos; says Israeli writer Etgar Keret. That Keret is praising the book is just a little ironic; Exit Wounds is not yet on sale in Israel. Commissioned first by a Canadian publisher, it was subsequently sold to Spain, Italy and Britain. But Hebrew books read right to left rather than left to right, and Modan has not yet had time to flip her drawings (some will need completely redrawing). &apos;If I don&apos;t, it will look as if my taxi driver is always on the wrong side of the road,&apos; she says. &apos;I think that might be irritating for the Israeli reader.&apos; Is there a comic book culture in Israel? &apos;Not really. It&apos;s the only country in the world where Superman was a flop.&apos; Modan wanted to write a book that dealt with the &apos;everyday matter&apos; of death. Like Ofek&apos;s documentary, Exit Wounds is a critique of the detachment that develops in people who have given up hope of there ever being an end to violence. The novel is full of black jokes about terror and peopled with characters who have become inured to violence. In the mortuary, the gabby woman at the front desk explains that she had to bury the body that might or might not be Gabriel&apos;s quickly because eight more corpses are about to arrive. &apos;Another suicide bombing?&apos; asks Koby. &apos;No, construction accident. Romanian workers,&apos; she replies. &apos;Oh,&apos; says Koby, flatly. Modan&apos;s point is that people adjust to fear unnervingly easily. &apos;After the intifada, there were attacks every day,&apos; she says. &apos;You really felt the danger. But you adjusted. I remember taking my daughter to kindergarten. I was late. On the way, I met a friend who told me that terrorists had taken over Tel Aviv bus station and that there was shooting. &quot;Oh, that&apos;s interesting,&quot; I said. &quot;But I&apos;m running! I&apos;m late! I&apos;ll call you later.&quot; It&apos;s insane, your priorities. That was what I wanted to capture in this book.&apos; But she has also produced a luscious work of art. Her drawings are heavily influenced by Herge - &apos;I like the way he arranges a page; there are so many frames, but it&apos;s still so clear&apos; - though her work is more muted; dusks are lilac, the insides of shops and cafes a buttery yellow. Has she always drawn? &apos;I was writing and illustrating stories from when I was five, but I never imagined that illustration could be a profession. My parents were scientists. My father was shocked when I went to art school; he wanted me to be a plastic surgeon because I had good hands.&apos; As well as working as an illustrator for the New Yorker and Le Monde, Modan is a co-founder of Actus Tragicus, a collective of comic artists, and she teaches at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem. Her books for children have won several prizes. &apos;I&apos;m not a writer,&apos; she says. &apos;The way I observe the world is visual. But if people describe the drawings in Exit Wounds as beautiful, they&apos;re missing the point. It&apos;s not a story with illustrations; you have to read the illustrations. The drawings are the words.&apos; Israel, she tells me, is an inspirational place for artists: &apos;It&apos;s so tense and it changes all the time.&apos; But for the time being, she is having to learn to work in unusual peace and quiet. She is living in Sheffield, while her husband is a postgraduate at the university. She can&apos;t quite get used to it, this chance to breathe freely. &apos;I thought I&apos;d be on the internet all the time, but it&apos;s nice to be so far from everything. Last summer was terrible. That stupid war [with Lebanon]. A fiasco and yet they&apos;re already talking about the next war.&apos; She can&apos;t remember the last time the political situation felt so desperate, and Exit Wounds, for all its life and humanity, is a product of this. &apos;More and more, people think only about their own lives. People only demonstrate if they feel they have the power to change things. If they don&apos;t, they stay home and drink coffee. I can&apos;t represent Israelis, but I will say that I find it strange that we keep going the same way, always more violence. My book starts like a detective story: whose is this body? But, in the end, that&apos;s not what matters. In the end, it&apos;s about Koby&apos;s relationship with his father and with this girl and his ability to leave the past behind. It&apos;s political: who&apos;s right, who&apos;s wrong ... just leave it, and get on with living.&apos; \u00b7 Exit Wounds is published by Jonathan Cape, \u00a314.99.

The villager scratched his head as if surprised to hear the city&apos;s name, although we could not have been more than five miles away as the crow flies. &apos;It&apos;s a problem&apos;, he said. &apos;Where exactly is it? Which direction?&apos; I asked anxiously. Having circled the area for so long, I had lost my bearings. I was last in Jenin - due north of Jerusalem beyond the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus - five years ago to write about a suicide bomber who killed himself and 15 Israelis, including a family of five, in a Jerusalem pizzeria. Back then Jenin was still on the map. But now this city of nearly 36,000 Palestinians seemed to have disappeared. In fact, apart from my villager friend, I had hardly seen a Palestinian since entering the West Bank. I first came to the West Bank as a correspondent in the early 1990s, during the upsurge of hope after the Oslo accords that promised an end to the Israeli occupation in exchange for Arab peace. Today as Israel celebrates the 40th anniversary of the 1967 Six-Day War which saw the occupation begin with Israeli troops taking Gaza and the West Bank (then under Jordanian control), hopes of withdrawal from the West Bank seem fanciful. The Oslo deal spelled hope, albeit briefly, because it allowed Israelis to &apos;see&apos; ordinary Palestinians for the first time and to consider living alongside them as neighbours instead of occupying their territory. But as Oslo foundered, Israel&apos;s construction across large swaths of the West Bank accelerated at a disorientating pace. The rise in Palestinian violence and a spate of suicide bombings has hastened what is now Israel&apos;s de facto annexation of large areas. Now the 1.8 million Palestinians living in the West Bank are separated into enclaves by checkpoints, and, more recently, encircled by an 8m-high wall and fence. Not only can Israelis nowadays not &apos;see&apos; Palestinians any more, but to all intents and purposes whole Palestinian cities have disappeared. Journeying through the West Bank my own disorientation began from the moment I set out from Jerusalem. At first I tried to leave the city by one of my old routes, but just before the Arab suburb of Abu Dis I ran into the Wall. &apos;Warsaw ghetto/Abu Dis ghetto&apos; was emblazoned on the wall at this point and my friends were quite unreachable on the other side. Turning away from the Wall, a network of Israeli roads, built for Jewish settlers, appeared to offer a swift alternative and I was soon being whisked through a new tunnel under the Mount of Olives, finding my way out towards the West Bank, where Jewish settlements now ring Jerusalem, crowding hilltops as far as the eye can see. These new settler roads were once viewed - like the settlements themselves - as &apos;obstacles to peace&apos;, not only because they carve into Arab land but also because, with their 50m buffer zones on either side, they divide the West Bank into separate Palestinian cantons. Today, however, nobody uses such outdated language as &apos;obstacles to peace&apos;. The Jerusalem &apos;settlements&apos; are &apos;new neighbourhoods&apos;. Firmly part of the West Bank landscape, the settler roads are now used by Israelis and foreigners alike, as they are fast and safe, connecting to the Israeli hub of Tel Aviv. Residents of Ariel, a new town of pink roofs and green lawns, no longer drive through parched Arab lands behind wire mesh but speed instead in bright saloons, reaching Ben Gurion airport in under an hour. And why should they know anything about what happens in Palestinian towns and villages around them? They could be forgiven for wondering if they were in West Bank at all. Even foreign diplomats, who lost their &apos;road map&apos; to peace long ago, now favour these new roads, as they make it easier to get about. To even talk of a &apos;peace process&apos; is now outmoded; instead the diplomats talk about &apos;the situation&apos; and &apos;the narrative&apos;. A US diplomat in Jerusalem had told me confidently before I left for Jenin that &apos;the narrative&apos; of &apos;the situation&apos; today was &apos;quite clear to all sides&apos;. Somewhere on the road north, however, I completely lost the plot. I turned to my new UN map of the West Bank, which meticulously traced even the roughest of Palestinian roads and marked every boundary, including the 1967 old Green Line, separating Israel from the West Bank. The UN map also marked the new Israeli barrier, but none of this was any help because it showed not a single West Bank settler road, so it was impossible to see how or where the two networks might intersect. I tried holding the UN map next to an Israeli map, but the two would not join. Suddenly I realised that I didn&apos;t even know if I was in the West Bank or Israel proper. A mile or so away I had seen a stretch of the Israeli barrier, here an electric fence with trenches, running through a fertile valley. But I knew that the fence did not follow the old 1967 Green Line but encroached far into the West Bank. So was I in some kind of eerie no man&apos;s land in between the new fence and the Green Line? So I tried to get into Jenin another way. An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem had spoken of another checkpoint at a place called Rehan, but that too seemed to be unmarked on any map. Reached by phone, the same spokesman now offered to find out where this checkpoint was but called back to say that even army HQ did not have a clue. I turned round and headed southeast towards where I hoped Jenin might be. Another checkpoint suddenly loomed ahead of me. &apos;Jenin?&apos; asked an Israeli soldier. It was somewhere &apos;over there&apos;, he thought, though he seemed unsure. But taking in a car could be a problem. I knew it was impossible to drive into Gaza nowadays, but then, already separated from the West Bank by Israel proper, it is now severed from the outside world. &apos;You shouldn&apos;t be going in there at all, you know,&apos; continued the Israeli soldier, apparently with my safety in mind. &apos;It&apos;s tough in there. There have been a lot of operations lately.&apos; I knew about the &apos;operations&apos;, I said. In one an ambulance driver had been beaten up at a checkpoint like this, and in another a Palestinian taxi driver had been shot dead by Israeli undercover soldiers in broad daylight. I had an appointment to see the families but was now running very late. Then suddenly the soldier changed his mind. His shift was over, he said, and smiling broadly added: &apos;I&apos;m out of here.&apos; Before leaving, he waved me on through the barrier and clambered into an APC, which headed off the other way. &apos;Welcome, welcome,&apos; said Fahima Mansour, 67, mother of the Jenin ambulance driver I had come to see. I had finally entered the city in late afternoon to find that the people of Jenin had not, after all, been spirited away. Everything was as it had ever been - the jostling crowds and traffic jams - and I began to get my bearings again. Rebuilt since the Israeli assault of 2002, the Jenin refugee camp walls were plastered with posters of suicide bombers and other &apos;martyrs&apos;. I just recognised Izzidin al-Masri, the 2001 Jerusalem pizzeria bomber, whose story had last brought me here. But his poster was now overlaid with many more. Underneath these posters, boys were sitting talking or staring with empty eyes into mobile phones. Some were watching videos of the latest Jenin martyr&apos;s death. &apos;Today we are in a prison,&apos; Fahima said, now allowing her son to describe how he had been beaten up at a checkpoint while driving doctors and nurses to a village. I then set off to the Kabatia road where Ashraf Haneishe, a Jenin taxi driver, was recently shot dead by Israeli soldiers disguised as Arabs. Mohammed Nazzal, 42, owner of a nearby garage and Ashraf&apos;s cousin, said he had heard shots and ran out to see Ashraf being dragged from his taxi and pumped with bullets in the knees, as his two passengers watched in shock. Then Ashraf was dragged to cypress trees by the road where, still alive, he was shot again and killed. Mohammed picked up his mobile phone, flicked opened the screen and thrust it in front of me. I found myself peering at a video of Ashraf&apos;s bloodstained body lolling around in a moving car as he was rushed to Jenin hospital. The Israelis later said Ashraf was a &apos;terrorist&apos; in the al-Aqsa Brigades but Mohammed said al-Aqsa claims these people after the event &apos;for the propaganda&apos;. Mohammed let Ashraf drive his young family around, which he would not have done if his cousin was &apos;wanted&apos;. In any event, why not arrest him after blasting his knees? Instead the 25-year-old was finished off in a ditch. &apos;But these killings are normal,&apos; said Mohammed. At Ashraf&apos;s home, his brother, Maher, cradled Ashraf&apos;s daughter Yasmin, aged two. Was Ashraf in the al-Aqsa Brigades, I asked? On the door was an al-Aqsa martyr&apos;s poster claiming him as theirs. The poster had superimposed Ashraf&apos;s boyish face on one of their standard martyr&apos;s posters. It didn&apos;t seem to me to fit. His brother glanced at the poster and shrugged as if to disown it. &apos;We all know now how those posters are made,&apos; he said with a look of utter despair. &apos;This was an execution, and that is all.&apos; He said &apos;lies&apos; had been printed in the Israeli press, claiming Ashraf had pulled a gun. At my side another mobile phone was flicked open. Maher had used still photographs of his brother&apos;s body as a screen saver. It was getting dark and the checkpoint was about to close for the night.

Today Israel still occupies the West Bank, there is a wall separating it from its Palestinian neighbours, and there is sporadic violence between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. So, what are the prospects for peace? In the 60 years since Israel was founded there have been five wars - six counting last summer&apos;s conflict in Lebanon - and two intifadas. Were they inevitable? If not, why hasn&apos;t a lasting peace been achieved? What went wrong? And who is to blame for a conflict which has seen thousands on both sides killed and which still shows no signs of abating? To answer these questions I&apos;m joined by Israel&apos;s elder statesman, Shimon Peres. He has been continuously active in Israeli politics since joining the labour movement even before Israel was founded in 1948. Since being elected to the Knesset almost half a century ago, he has served in many ministerial posts including twice as prime minister. But his greatest achievement came in 1994 when, as foreign minister, he finalised the Oslo peace agreement which led to him sharing the Nobel Peace Prize with Yasser Arafat. Two years ago the former socialist kibbutznik controversially left the Labour party to join the Kadima led government of Ariel Sharon, Labour&apos;s old foe. He remains deputy prime minister in that government under Sharon&apos;s successor, Ehud Olmert. Transcript of the interview Nick Stadlen: Mr Peres, in your evidence to the Winograd Commission, you said &quot;!f it were up to me I wouldn&apos;t have started this war&quot;, referring to last year&apos;s war against Lebanon. Can you explain why? Shimon Peres: I wouldn&apos;t like to go into that issue. I can only say that that&apos;s half of the quotation. What I say...they attacked clearly, we have to defend ourselves. NS: But when you said from the transcript &quot;If it were up to me I wouldn&apos;t have started the war ...&quot; SP: I can&apos;t comment because I didn&apos;t say it after the war, I said it during the war ... the deliberation, and it&apos;s a little bit complicated and I&apos;m not in a position to reveal the whole story so I don&apos;t want to deal with it. NS: You also said that you can&apos;t say that the war failed, but that you also can&apos;t truthfully say that the war succeeded.  SP: I said it ... the war was a military success but a psychological problem, that&apos;s what I said. NS: What did you mean by a psychological defeat?  SP: It came out that Hezbollah boasted that they won the war, which was nonsense, and we talked in many voices, so we lost the psychological battle. NS: In retrospect, do you think it would have been better if there had been no war?  SP: It would have been better if Hezbollah hadn&apos;t attacked us. NS: But given that the... SP: Once they attacked us we were left without a choice...I wouldn&apos;t go for any initiative of war but clearly they fired a missile to Haifa and they started to shoot around ... I really feel uncomfortable because only part of my evidence was released and it would take a long time and I don&apos;t want to continue because still, cabinets are cabinets and I don&apos;t feel I have to reveal everything I&apos;ve said. NS: Of course. But looking just at the war, one of the criticisms that was made of the war in which the war was conducted was that the degree of force used by Israel was disproportionate ... SP: That I don&apos;t buy ... NS: Well ... SP: By whom was it said it? NS: Well, for example, Mr Eli Yishai, who was one of the deputy prime ministers, and a member of the security cabinet, said: &quot;if the Hezbollah fires Katushas, we have to deliver a severe blow to Lebanon&apos;s infrastructure, black out Beirut, cut off electricity, turn off the water, flatten entire villages.&quot; SP: But that didn&apos;t happen ... NS: And then he said: &quot;If Lebanese citizens pay the price they will rise up against Hezbollah.&quot; SP: Yes but all this didn&apos;t happen, I think. NS: Well, to what extent was ... SP: I mean, there was an attack on the Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, but we were aware that it was a military installation. It was empty of people, nobody was killed there, so Beirut wasn&apos;t cut off, Beirut wasn&apos;t bombed, the electricity wasn&apos;t cut off. NS: But there was a great deal of destruction of infrastructure and ...  SP: What do you mean infrastructure, depends where ... NS: Well, ports, lighthouses, grain silos, bridges ... SP: No, only when they used it for firing missiles or to deliver missiles. But those....they used the port for smuggling so we stopped it. There wasn&apos;t any intention as far as I know to attack civilian targets. NS: So you wouldn&apos;t accept that there was a deliberate policy of trying to put pressure - political pressure - on the Lebanese government to close down Hezbollah?  SP: The fact is that all those things that Mr Yishai mentioned weren&apos;t targeted, weren&apos;t attacked. NS: The result of the war is that Hezbollah is still in place and they are still are armed. What has been achieved from the point of view of Israel?  SP: The whole area between the ... river and the Israeli border is today manned by two forces: the Lebanese army and the ... force. We asked all the time that the Lebanese army would replace Hezbollah to be deployed on the border, and that is what happened actually. That&apos;s number one. Secondly I think that Hezbollah paid a heavy toll, they lost apparently 650 or 700 of their fighters, thousands were wounded, many houses were destroyed because they manned Hezbollah and their weapons. Hezbollah say they&apos;re going to restore it but to this very day they&apos;ve not restored it. And they didn&apos;t answer the question: why did they go to war? What for? What did they have in their minds? What is the justification of it? And also they don&apos;t answer a question which I&apos;m all the time surprised. Can you really permit in any land to have an army within an army and a state within a state? - to serve as an agent in Iran at the heart of....The problem with Lebanon is not Israel, the problem of Lebanon is Hezbollah. And you cannot close your eyes. It&apos;s basic, you know we tried for four times to make peace. Twice we succeeded twice we failed. We succeeded with Egypt and Jordan. We failed with the Palestinians and the Lebanese. The obvious reason is clear. I mean, the Egyptians and the Jordanians have a government, an army, a policy, and serve as an address. The Lebanese and the Palestinians are divided, they have many governments and no governments, many armies and no armies, and many projects and no projects. So that is the real difference, otherwise we would do with the Palestinians and the Lebanese the same thing we did with the Egyptians and the Jordanians. NS: Well if we could look at the opportunities for peace, in 1995 when you took over from Prime Minister Rabin, you were trying to continue his peace initiative with President Assad, and you sent him a message saying: &quot;Are you prepared to fly high and fast?&quot;... SP: Yes. NS: And that came to nothing because there were some terrorist bombs in Israel, your party lost the next election, Mr Netanyahu failed to honour the initiative that Mr Rabin had started and you had continued. Do you think that was a lost opportunity for peace?  SP: Well there were many losers. It&apos;s not simple. But first of all let me distinguish between two parts of your question. One is the negotiation with Syria, the other is the relations with the Palestinians. What brought me down were the Palestinians not the Syrians. The Syrians I got a message from the United States - by Warren Christopher who was the Secretary of State - that Assad thinks that he can talk with me and we can make peace, and President Clinton asked me if I&apos;m aware of all the promises that Rabin gave to the Americans, I says I hope I know all of them but if Rabin promised something that I&apos;m unaware of writing I shall respect it - no problem whatsoever. And that was delivered to the Syrians but I told them, look, we are at the beginning of 1996, by the end of 1996 we have to go elections anyway. I cannot go to elections with an open stomach. If you want to negotiate we have to conclude it before the elections. I cannot just start the negotiations saying we are ready to do this and that and not having any reply. So the Americans told me that the answer of Assad was: I am ready to meet you. I said we have to negotiate fast in a short while to reach an agreement and in order to do it lets meet, cut the corners. So I got back an answer: I&apos;m ready to meet you but I can&apos;t fix a time. So I told the Americans jokingly, look, a girl without a date is like a date without a girl. It&apos;s not an answer. Then what happened with the Palestinians was tragic because I took over from Rabin and I know that the time is short so I gave back to the Palestinians 460 settlements, 6 cities, then the Palestinians asked me to have elections including Jerusalem. I went for it. It&apos;s a great risk. And all of a sudden they started again with acts of terror that nobody understood. Bomb in a bus in Jerusalem, in the middle of the day, next day in Tel Aviv, next day again in Jerusalem. I know that they are killing me. And I went to Arafat and I told him: stop it, what you are doing is so foolish, you don&apos;t permit me to implement. He says yes yes yes, he didn&apos;t do it, but then I told him look if you don&apos;t do it I shall do it myself. And then he took actions - he arrested hundred heads of the Hamas, he killed twenty, he shaved their beards, but it was too late. I lost the elections because of it. Because Netanyahu said: look what he gave, look what he got. And then Arafat was crying but it was too late. His tears didn&apos;t replace my ballots. NS: Well, if it had not been for that, do you think there would have been a possibility of a peace settlement with Syria in 1996?  SP: Yes. NS: And that of course would have been the best way, wouldn&apos;t it, of solving the problem of Hezbollah and Lebanon?  SP: Yes. NS: Looking at the Palestinians, Mr Ben Gurion famously said in 1967 that the West Bank and the Occupied Territories should be given back, possibly not Jerusalem because of the historical ties, and looking back over the last forty years, don&apos;t you think it was a historic mistake not to give back the occupied territories?  SP: Look, we gave back to Egypt and Jordan all the water all the land all the oil, we didn&apos;t keep anything. So why? Because there was a partner. We couldn&apos;t make peace with Egypt under Nasser, we could make peace with Egypt under Sadat. We could make peace with Jordan under Hussein. The problem with Arafat was without him it couldn&apos;t start, with him it couldn&apos;t finish. That was the problem. Now you cannot do anything without negotiations, we gave all the land and we didn&apos;t get all the peace back. NS: Well you say you gave all the land, you didn&apos;t give any land in West Bank and Gaza.  SP: Because in the West Bank and Gaza it was complicated and there was no formal line ... look, the West Bank was under Jordanian rule, Gaza was under Egyptian rule. They never gave it to the Palestinians. We were the first - in Oslo - to suggest it to them. To create a nation. The border should have been negotiated, it wasn&apos;t an international border like with Egypt or like with Jordan or Lebanon. And we were ready to move ahead. We divided it into three zones, A, B and C, and we wanted to do it gradually, step by step but we were ready to start. The problem is that the Palestinian leadership did not control the terror, couldn&apos;t stop the terror. NS: But has the problem not been made much worse by the massive increase in settlements in the West Bank over the last 40 years?  SP: Maybe. Look the history of Israel is divided into two parts. One, under attack that we have had to defend ourselves. When you defend yourself your thinking is totally different from when you want to make peace. For example, I authorised a settlement near Jerusalem because I thought Jerusalem was in danger. Under peaceful conditions I wouldn&apos;t do it. I think that until 1973, until the war of Kippur, Israel was totally under threat. We were outmanned, outgunned, never had the slightest chance of peace. Only in 1973 did it start to change. So under attack you behave like if you want a hawk, when peace comes you become a dove, so when people ask me why did you change your opinion - I didn&apos;t change my opinion, when we&apos;re in danger I worked for the defence of the country, when we had a chance I worked for peace. NS: But in the thirty five years or so since Yom Kippur war, Israel has not been under immediate attack from its Arab neighbouring countries, and during that time there has been an enormous increase in the settlements, for example, during the period when you and Mr Rabin were prime ministers - between 1992 and 1996 - there was a 50% increase... SP: No, what happened is that we inherited the government of Mr Netanyahu. I don&apos;t remember the exact numbers but Netanyahu permitted twenty four thousand houses to be built on the West Bank. We decided to stop it. We went through all the legal conditions and we came to the conclusion that we can&apos;t stop 12,000 that were already under construction, legally we couldn&apos;t stop it, so it&apos;s true that 12,000 houses were added and 12,000 houses were crossed out because we acted under legal conditions. NS: Between 1992 and 1996 there was a 50% increase in settlers from 100,000 to 150,000.  SP: Well that includes Jerusalem too. I mean the idea of settlements is different between our concept and the Palestinian concept. They include people who have settled in Jerusalem as a settlement, which is not serious because they too increase their population in Jerusalem. So what? NS: Well, you say you were acting under legal constraint but this is all territory which under the 1948 partition of the UN was not part of the land of Israel. SP: All right, but they refused to take it. Look, would they take the whole partition of the Israel as the legal foundation? Ben Gurion was ready. They rejected it. Look, you cannot say: I don&apos;t take it, I attack you. If I shall win OK, if I shall lose I win too. You cannot do it. NS: But are you suggesting that the fact that the Arab armies attacked in 1948 means that the Palestinians living in the West Bank forfeited for all time their legal rights to that territory.  SP: No, the problem was: what is the West Bank, not the people. But what is the West Bank? Because you see the Arabs too agreed, they agree to 1967 not to 1948 they understand it. They changed the concept of the borders. Look, you cannot go to war, lose the war and then say pay me a price. Why should you pay a price? If you go to war once, twice, three times, the next time you say Just a moment, next borders should be defensible, and that&apos;s according with UN 242 and 238. NS: But what are you suggesting are defensible borders in relation to the West Bank? Is it the Green line?  SP: Look, more or less there was an agreement in Camp David when Barak and Arafat were heading the negotiations. It was agreed that the 1967 borders minus, I don&apos;t know how much - 6%, 7%, 8%, should be traded for 6%, 7% elsewhere. Why? Because meantime we have had facts that is very hard to deal with, like the settlements. So the idea at that time was to concentrate the settlements on two or three or four percent - I can&apos;t give you the exact number - and the rest we shall...compensate. Defensible borders is not only a matter of size but a matter of demography, of layout. NS: Moshe Dyan once said about the settlements that their purpose was not to keep security better than the army, but because without them we can&apos;t keep the army in those territories and without them the IDF would be a foreign army ruling a foreign population.  SP: Maybe he felt that way. NS: Do you think in relation to the wall that that has been a major step backwards?  SP: No I don&apos;t think so. Because you see Israel was attacked by suicidal murderers, suicidal bombers, we have had to stop it. And the wall stopped it. The fact is that since the wall we don&apos;t have suicidal bombers. NS: But is that not partly due to the Hamas de facto ceasefire rather than the wall?  SP: No I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not. I know I was in all those occasions where decisions were taken, I know the real story. We reluctantly build a wall. And also the wall was changed many times to bring it closer to the Green Line. There is only an escape from the Green Line of 8% or something like it. NS: Well it is 8% and as you&apos;ll be aware Jimmy Carter in his book Palestine - Peace Not Apartheid, in an article about his book he describes what he calls &quot;the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation..&quot; SP: What would he do? What would he do? I mean look, it is very hard to criticise, but when the United States is facing problems in Iraq or Afghanistan or Korea they take military measures. It&apos;s very easy to give empty advice. I will respect the idea or opinion of Carter if he would suggest an alternative. All the attempts to stop terror were in vain. You know, in England too you take a lot of measures you wouldn&apos;t take, by having cameras in all the streets, by following suspicious people, yes you do it because you want to defend your life. NS: But isn&apos;t the positioning of the wall such that it is simply designed to increase the scope for expansion of the Israeli settlements.  SP: No I don&apos;t think so, I don&apos;t think the wall will play a role in it. NS: Well if you drive around the wall you see the wall is very hard up against the borders of the Arab town s... SP: They&apos;re against the centres of terror and they follow the line. I mean the escape of 8% can easily be changed or corrected. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a problem. NS: You were originally against the wall were you not, and threatened to resign?  SP: Well, I, I thought that the wall should be very close to the Green line if at all, and I thought that we could take other measures, I don&apos;t want to go into it, I thought we could have taken more electronic measures, but it came out it didn&apos;t function. NS: If you go, for example, to Bethlehem, people say that it is in effect being encircled. First of all there are some 24 Jewish settlements around Bethlehem and now a combination of the wall to the North and the West and the bypass roads which link the Jewish settlements effectively create segregation between Bethlehem and ... SP: Look I can&apos;t go into polemics endlessly but I shall tell you about Bethlehem. I went to the airport in Gaza to negotiate with Arafat his ceasefire. When we were there we were bombed - doesn&apos;t matter. I told him, look: there are this and this gentlemen who are firing from Bethlehem against Jerusalem. Tell them to stop it because we shall not have a choice. He says immediately. And I gave him the name of the family that did it. He called in his chief of staff says stop it. I went back home, satisfied, before I came back home the fire continued. And nothing was done. So Arafat says: you will see tomorrow morning, it will be finished. Ok, tomorrow morning we saw with our own eyes the family that was firing - there was a group or tribe or whatever it is - running with open jeeps in the streets of Bethlehem. So ... you force us to take measures.

Born into a conservative but not an ultra-religious family in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, she was 22 at the time and married. She had finished her undergraduate degree in English literature and philosophy at Bar Ilan University and had become deeply religious. In the first years after the war, Weiss became involved in the settlement movement as they began to build deep inside the now Israeli-occupied West Bank. She was first at Ofra, an early settlement just north of Ramallah, and then at Kedumim from December 1975. Weiss does not talk of an &quot;occupation&quot;, but uses the word &quot;liberation&quot; for the territory captured by Israel in the six-day war. She talks not of &quot;settlements&quot; but &quot;communities,&quot; not of &quot;building anew&quot; but of &quot;resettling&quot; on the land. To her the Jews have a historic right to the land stretching back thousands of years, while the Palestinians are a &quot;new formation.&quot; &quot;We felt literally the revival of the biblical narrative. So to return to it was to return to the glory of the past history of the Jewish nation. These are the terms by which I lived and live. I saw myself being a pioneer continuing the work that my parents and grandparents did in the coastal plain in Tel Aviv. I saw myself as privileged to continue the Zionist effort.&quot; The settlements grew slowly but steadily, both under Israel&apos;s Labour and Likud governments, often with state support and almost always with military protection. Today, there are around 460,000 settlers living in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Some are there for their religious beliefs, others for economic incentives on offer. The number of West Bank settlers has doubled since the Oslo peace accords in 1993 and some of the largest settlement blocs are now within the path of Israel&apos;s West Bank barrier, suggesting it hopes to hold on to the land in any final agreement. Settlers in the occupied territories use what the Israeli military calls &quot;sterile roads,&quot; which are set aside for Israeli-registered cars only. The settler community has become a vocal political lobby, exercising considerable influence over government. Pioneers At first, Weiss&apos;s settler community wanted to build inside the Palestinian town of Nablus. But the Israeli government refused permission, so they settled on the hilltops nearby. When her settlement first began, she lived with her husband and two young children in a tent. There was a generator for power, but little else. Later it became a small shack, then a trailer until it became effectively a small town, with properly surfaced roads, houses, parks, shops, electricity, telephone connections, running water and a guarded perimeter. It is home to around 3,000 settlers. It felt a long way from her home in Tel Aviv. &quot;After sundown it was as if you were on the moon. You didn&apos;t see a glimmer. I remember I said to myself: &apos;I am like Robinson Crusoe.&apos; There was a real sense of being pioneers. We were thinking there are Arabs here and Jews here and for us it is a return to our origin ... We were two different cultures.&quot; In the early days, she thought little of the Palestinian community around her, except to note that she saw little electricity or education. In later years, through the first and second intifada, there have been more and more clashes between the settlers and the Palestinians living around them. In 2002, Weiss&apos;s son-in-law Avraham Gavish, his parents and grandfather were shot dead in their home by a Palestinian militant. Weiss believes that the land of Israel should be the Biblical &quot;Promised Land&quot;, stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates, which today would take in a large chunk of Egypt, Israel and the occupied territories, the whole of Jordan, and a broad slice of western Iraq. &quot;I feel myself being part of a Biblical scene. It was a very dramatic change in my life and when I see now over 200 communities and outposts and villages and 260,000 Jews in these communities I feel I am part of a huge Zionist miracle,&quot; she says. &quot;The rights of the Jews to return to their homeland stem from a history of 4,000 years and then an intermission of 2,000 years was imposed. Did it take away our right? Or were our everlasting prayers a constant link? I, of course, believe it was a constant link that was revived with Zionism.&quot; Illegal Under international law, however, the settlements are illegal because an occupying power is not permitted to transfer its population on to occupied land. But Weiss disagrees, calling this &quot;modern politics.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think these changes in the world can in any way change the basic link between the Jewish nation and the Land of Israel.&quot; Her sense is that the settlement movement of the past 40 years has made Israel a stronger nation. &quot;No peace can be attained if the State of Israel is small,&quot; she says. The future borders of Israel, she argues, should include the West Bank. As for the Palestinians, those who accept Israeli sovereignty should stay, those who fight will be fought and those who don&apos;t accept sovereignty should leave. Those who stay, she says, could be offered passports but only if they pass tests of &quot;loyalty and devotion&quot; to the state of Israel. &quot;100 years ago we were 10% of the population west of the Jordan River and now there are two-thirds Jews and one-third Arabs, so who says who will have the upper hand?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-05T01:24:20Z", "title": "Six-day war: Rory McCarthy talks to Daniella Weiss, 62, mayor of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim", "sentences": ["Born into a conservative but not an ultra-religious family in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, she was 22 at the time and married.", "I saw myself being a pioneer continuing the work that my parents and grandparents did in the coastal plain in Tel Aviv.", "It felt a long way from her home in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/israel5"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Refugees"], "article": "Senan Abdelqader - an infant when the war was fought - was born and grew up in the Arab village of Taibeh, in Israel. He left, aged 18, to study in Germany, returning 15 years later as a qualified, practising, prize-winning architect. Abdelqader is from the 20% minority of Arabs living within Israel, a people most often referred to by the Israeli establishment as Arab Israelis. It is not a term he uses. &quot;I am sure about my identity. I am an Arab Palestinian ... I don&apos;t feel myself very Israeli,&quot; he says. He carries an Israeli passport, but that isolates him from most of the Arab world - he can only travel to Jordan and Egypt. &quot;But even when I go there I am considered an Israeli and I am not part of Arabic culture. And this is painful. I cannot feel myself.&quot; In Israel he is part of a minority that, though it has citizenship, suffers routine and continued discrimination, particularly at work and in government spending on housing and education. Although Palestinian Israelis can travel freely within Israel, they, like all Israeli citizens, are not allowed to travel to the main urban centres of the West Bank. Often they are also restricted from travelling to Gaza. There are Palestinian Israeli MPs in the Knesset, and earlier this year the first Muslim Arab cabinet member was appointed. However, several Palestinian Israeli intellectuals and activists have begun a campaign to demand broader rights in Israel, and have started to challenge the notion of Israel as a Jewish state. The fraught question of identity shapes Abdelqader&apos;s work. No new Arab town has been built in Israel since the state was created. &quot;Since 1948, the urban fabric in Palestine has been stopped. But it is more than stopped, it has been forced to take a kind of agricultural mentality.&quot; Arab towns in Israel are more like enlarged and overcrowded villages. Abdelqader, who is now perhaps the leading Palestinian Israeli architect in Israel, is working on a project to design a contemporary art museum for Umm al-Fahm, an Arab town in northern Israel. His design puts the museum inside a wide bridge that stretches across a valley, a bridge that will be part public, cultural space, part busy walkway. It is unusual for a Palestinian Israeli architect to have such input in a public project. &quot;We are not part of the process of influencing and creating public spaces.&quot; Although he has worked on several other buildings in Israel, there has been little opportunity to work alongside architects living in the occupied Palestinian territories, even though they live nearby, speak the same language and share the same history. Many Palestinians sense a broad divide between those living within Israel and those living in the West Bank or Gaza, both in terms of opportunity and ambition. While Palestinians in the occupied territories are still struggling to end 40 years of occupation and establish their own state, within Israel some leading Palestinian figures have become increasingly vocal in demanding broader, collective rights and in challenging the rationale of a Jewish state. Two agendas &quot;The Palestinian nation became divided into two different agendas and it makes me very sorry not having the opportunity to work together with them,&quot; he says. &quot;There are two different agendas: we are looking for equality, they are looking for authority.&quot; He teaches architecture at Tel Aviv University, where the vast majority of his students are Jewish Israelis. That itself is often an initial challenge for the students in a country where the two communities often do not mix, or see each other only through the tint of mutual suspicion and unequal power relations, where Arabs are more often seen working in menial jobs, standing at the petrol pump or cleaning the streets. &quot;Jewish Israeli society has to understand that we were here and part of the landscape before they came and they will understand that they have to have more respect for us.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-05T01:27:22Z", "title": "Six-day war: Rory McCarthy talks to Senan Abdelqader, 44, architect in Beit Safafa", "sentences": ["&quot;There are two different agendas: we are looking for equality, they are looking for authority.&quot; He teaches architecture at Tel Aviv University, where the vast majority of his students are Jewish Israelis."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/israel4"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "It was Moshe Dayan, the hero of Israel&apos;s 1967 victory, who set the tone for what was to follow: &quot;We are waiting for a telephone call,&quot; the one-eyed general said disdainfully as the frontline Arab states - Egypt, Jordan and Syria - reeled from their crushing defeat. Of the Palestinians - the newly conquered population of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip - little was said at the time. But the six-day war put them back at centre stage in their conflict with Israel. They have stayed there ever since. &quot;Rarely has so short and localised a conflict had such prolonged, global consequences,&quot; commented the historian Michael Oren. &quot;Seldom has the world&apos;s attention been gripped, and remained seized, by a single event and its ramifications.&quot; Israel&apos;s triumph, someone else observed wisely, was &quot;a cursed blessing&quot;. Perceptions have changed so much in 40 years that it is hard now to recapture the sympathy that was felt for Israel as Egypt mobilised, and residents of Tel Aviv filled sandbags. If the country&apos;s leaders talked emotively about the vulnerable &quot;Auschwitz borders&quot; left after their 1948 war of independence, blood-curdling Arab rhetoric bolstered the image of Israel as the underdog. But little David, just 19 that May, was rapidly to become a lumbering Goliath. As euphoric Israelis thronged across Jordanian lines to Jerusalem&apos;s Old City and marvelled at its Jewish and Muslim holy places, a little-known guerrilla commander named Yasser Arafat fled Ramallah and Palestinians adjusted to a new reality of curfews, informers and military occupation. And it is that occupation, now as then, that stands at the heart of the conflict between two peoples engaged in a vicious, primordial - and utterly unequal - struggle over one small land. It has taken a terrible toll. For Palestinians, 1967 was an extension of what began in Ottoman times, before they were a nation in the modern sense, when - half a century before the Nazi Holocaust - Zionists called for &quot;solving&quot; the Jewish problem in &quot;a land without a people for a people without a land&quot;. If 1948 was their first nakba (catastrophe), the June war was the next devastating instalment. It will long be debated whether Israel missed an early opportunity for peace. But the war reignited the dormant debate about the territorial limits of Zionism, fatefully fusing religion, nationalism and security. It produced no strategy for turning military supremacy into a tool to change relations with the Arab world. &quot;The truth of the matter was that when the Arabs finally called, Israel&apos;s line was either busy or there was no one on the Israeli side to pick up the phone,&quot; the Israeli scholar Shlomo Ben-Ami wrote later of Dayan&apos;s laconic quip. Israel seemed to care less about peace than territory. It insisted that what it simultaneously called the &quot;administered territories&quot; and &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; (the Hebrew names for the West Bank) were up for negotiation. (Unlike East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights, they were never annexed.) But the creation of &quot;facts on the ground&quot; gradually erased the old green line border, and nowhere more completely than around Jerusalem. The result - which some call apartheid - is 450,000 Jews living with full democratic rights in 125 settlements amidst 2.5 million Arabs under illegal occupation. The wars of 1973 and 1982 and the return of Sinai to Egypt changed nothing on that central Palestinian front. Israel&apos;s &quot;liberal occupation&quot; - a flattering self-image that won wide international acceptance - did not outlive the 20th anniversary of the six-day war. The first intifada - the largely peaceful &quot;war of stones&quot; that erupted in 1987 - did more for the Palestinians than two decades of &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;armed struggle,&quot; reminding the world, and growing numbers of Israelis, that a settlement had to address their demands. Yitzhak Rabin&apos;s recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) at Oslo was a historic turning-point. But Rabin and Arafat could not translate their &quot;peace of the brave&quot; into a workable final deal. The Islamist movement Hamas, which rejected the legitimacy of Israel even in its pre-67 borders, pioneered suicide bombings and got the Likud&apos;s Binyamin Netanyahu elected. The militarised second intifada was the disastrous result. Netanyahu was right about one thing: the Middle East is a &quot;tough neighbourhood,&quot; as he famously remarked. It has got a lot tougher. Today there is a generation of Palestinians who have known nothing but occupation and a generation of Israelis who have experienced only dominance and repression of the Palestinians. As the Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz pointed out, justice and occupation are not compatible. Both societies have been traumatised and brutalised. Israel has its &quot;separation wall,&quot; built to keep bombers away from its restaurants and shopping malls but perceived as another land grab. Palestinian workers have been replaced by Chinese and Filipinos. But its military superiority has not created the security and normality it craves. Gaza - unilaterally abandoned by Ariel Sharon - has become a vast prison, a global byword for misery, desperation and anarchy, a cruel parody of the freedom the Palestinians yearn for. Pessimists believe too much water and blood have flown down the Jordan in these 40 years, that these changes are irreversible, that this is a land that can now be neither shared peacefully nor divided. Optimists point out that time has not stood still. Egypt and Jordan have made peace with Israel, with realism if not joy. Syria (and Lebanon) will follow suit if Israel returns the Golan. March&apos;s summit in Saudi Arabia confirmed peace as the &quot;strategic choice&quot; of the entire Arab League, a far cry from the three noes - to peace, to recognition and to negotiation - of the Khartoum conference in September 1967. Mayhem in Iraq, jihadist fanaticism and Iranian ambitions are all part of the new geostrategic equation. Still, the Palestinians remain at centre stage. A solution for the refugees is vital; so are the interlinked questions of Jerusalem, borders and a viable, independent state. Even Hamas claims it will settle for the pre-1967 lines, as it fires rockets - legitimate &quot;resistance,&quot; it insists - across them. Much depends on whether it will learn to act pragmatically like the PLO before it: engagement is more likely to encourage that than isolation. Israel&apos;s acceptance as part of the Middle East is at stake. Majorities on both sides say they want peace but few believe it is attainable. It has all been discussed countless times in the last four decades. It all still looks impossibly hard to achieve. History In the months before June 1967, relations between Israel and its neighbours Syria and Egypt were strained. There were clashes on the Syrian border, provoked by both sides. In Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser put on a show of force in support of Syria. Egyptian troops were sent into Sinai and on May 22 Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran, cutting off Israel&apos;s port of Eilat from the Red Sea. On June 5, Israel&apos;s prime minister, Levi Eshkol, launched a first strike. At 7.45am Israeli jets attacked Egypt&apos;s air bases in Sinai and Suez: by mid-morning the Egyptian air force was all but wiped out. Israeli armoured divisions pushed south into Sinai and the Egyptian military fled. Jordanian forces attacked in Jerusalem but their air force was quickly destroyed. On June 6, Israeli paratroopers fought their way into the Jordanian-held east of the city and by the next day Israel took the Old City and the Western Wall. Other units pushed into the West Bank. The Syrian air force had been destroyed and Israeli forces took the Golan Heights. On June 10 a ceasefire was signed. Israel had defeated three Arab armies.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-05T01:31:14Z", "title": "Six days of war, 40 years of failure", "sentences": ["Perceptions have changed so much in 40 years that it is hard now to recapture the sympathy that was felt for Israel as Egypt mobilised, and residents of Tel Aviv filled sandbags."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/israel1"}, {"tags": ["Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "When my dad was 17 and doing his A-levels, there were a number of Jews in his class. When the Six-day War broke out, their hearts and minds turned east as they worried about what would become of Little Israel, the Jewish state that had only just celebrated its 19th birthday. By sunset on the first day of the war, with the destruction of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces, my dad and his classmates were already celebrating. Israel had seized the initiative and taken control of its own destiny. The Jewish state had battled for its existence once again and hammered out a resounding victory. My dad and his friends spent their break times over the next five days chalking up the specific details of Israel&apos;s triumphs on the classroom blackboard. In less than a week, Israel Hakatantonet - Little Israel - had become a big man; a force to be reckoned with. The victory united the nation, and Jews the world over shared in their pride. Many made Aliyah - &quot;elevated&quot; themselves to become Israeli citizens and live in the Jewish state. Absent Israelis returned home, with renewed pride in their nation that had so emphatically crumbled the threat looming over its borders since 1948. My dad&apos;s aunt took her family to Tel Aviv to become Israeli and her grandchildren now serve as proud soldiers in the same army that so impressed her 40 years ago. I have not met a Jew in the world, no matter how left wing, no matter how pacifist, no matter how pragmatic, that has not shown a flicker of deep-rooted pride when the subject of the Six-day War arises. This was an achievement of epic proportions. In fact, you might even say it was a miracle. Unfortunately, many said just that. As a united Israel revelled in its achievements, the majority might not have noticed an empowered movement gaining control of the reins of the nation&apos;s political future. A rather embellished story is told of Shlomo Goren, the Chief Rabbi of the IDF, who accompanied his troops during the Six-day War. As the Israeli forces fought their way into Jerusalem, pushing back the Jordanian army, Rabbi Goren marched at the front of the troops, holding high a Sefer Torah and a Shofar - a symbolic ram&apos;s horn. Even as the soldiers engaged in battle, shots cracking and ricocheting around him, an unarmed Goren held the holy scrolls aloft and led his troops to the Western Wall of the Temple, where he blew the shofar calling the Jewish people home to Jerusalem. There they prayed to God and thanked them for their delivery. It was God that had secured victory for the Jewish people, handing them the original homelands of the Jewish people - in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. And by positioning himself at the head of the troops, Rabbi Goren placed religion at the vanguard of Jewish politics. It is impossible to divide Judaism into its component parts. Judaism at once embodies race, culture and religion and where one ends and the next begins is hard to discern. The Jewish people are therefore a complex entity. For this reason, it is of little surprise that most Israelis shared in the euphoria over the religious and cultural value of the Biblical cities and ruins of the newly-captured territory. The national victory of the Jewish people was caught up with spiritual, emotional and religious resonance. But perhaps, in the celebrations of Israel&apos;s victory, the majority of Israelis didn&apos;t appreciate the value of the new territory to the national religious movement, nor notice the movement&apos;s growing strength. Drunk on the taste of victory, perhaps the secular Israelis didn&apos;t realise the lengths to which the religious movement would go to keep hold of these lands. For the secular, Zionism meant a strong state for the Jewish people, on part of the ancient Jewish homeland. But for the religious, it was subtly different: the Jewish nation could only be strong if built on all of the ancient Jewish homeland. Now, with control over the West Bank, religious Zionism also had control over its own destiny. It was a subtly different perception of who had won the war. For the majority of secular Israelis, it was a strong Jewish nation that had taken matters into their own hands and realised the mantra that they had been repeating since the Holocaust: &quot;Never Again&quot;. The war had shown the Arab countries that Israel was not to be messed with and the occupied lands could be used to guarantee Israel&apos;s future security, trading them for peace when the time was right. For the religious movement, however, God had won, delivering the Jews from their enemies. And the new lands - the ancient, sacred realms of Judea and Samaria - were his blessing; a symbol of his love for the Jewish people and a possession never to be squandered. The religious movement now had not only the will and the lands, but also the divine mandate to consolidate their vision of the Jewish state. Religion gained an unprecedented hold over the practical governance of Israel. At the front of his legion, Sefer and Shofar aloft, Rabbi Goren led the army and the Jewish people on a journey that was only just beginning. Resting on the 7th day, most of Israel was caught napping and couldn&apos;t possibly have imagined what the outcome of this journey would mean for Little Israel and the rest of the Middle East in the years to come.

The West Bank is divided into zones with different rights of movement and access for Palestinians, which makes travel between and even within them uncertain and often difficult. This is exacerbated by routine as well as random checkpoints and unannounced blocking off of roads. The advent of the wall with its crossing points controlled by Israeli soldiers has cut off several Palestinian communities from agricultural land on which they depend for their livelihood. Some land is confiscated for security reasons, a term which can include building civilian roads, from which Palestinian cars are banned, to connect Israeli settlements to each other and to Jerusalem. Dr Khatib, the former Palestinian planning minister whom I interviewed, is not allowed to visit even East Jerusalem for a medical appointment without applying for a written permit which, if given, may be for no more than three hours. The contrast with daily life in Israel could hardly be greater. With the suspension of suicide bombings still basically holding, there is a sense that the problems and grievances of the Palestinians in the West Bank might be a thousand miles away. The group of boisterous twentysomething girls we sat next to watching the England-Israel football match in a Tel Aviv bar had little awareness of or interest in what is happening in the West Bank. The occupation has been a fact of life since long before they were born. The Israeli economy has picked up and the only intrusion of the unresolved conflict on their daily lives seems to come in the military service, which involves many young Israelis in policing their neighbours. Interviewing Shimon Peres a few days after Hannan Ashrawi and Ghassan Khatib, I was struck by how similar they are. All are highly articulate, thoughtful, well reasoned in their arguments and well versed in the history of the Middle East. All have struggled for national independence but also have a clear understanding of the legitimate aspirations of the other side. And they all want peace. It is hard to believe that they represent two peoples who have been in a state of intermittent armed conflict for more than 60 years. In terms of outlook they seem to have far more in common with each other than Peres has with his co-vice prime minister, Avigdor Lieberman - a politician who called for Arab Knesset members who talk to Hamas to be executed - or than Ashrawi and Khatib have with those leaders of Hamas who masterminded the suicide bombing campaigns. And yet while Shimon Peres is free to travel the world the other two are not free to leave the West Bank without permission from the Israeli authorities. So why has there been no peace? According to Peres: &quot;The Lebanese and the Palestinians are divided; they have many governments and no governments, many armies and no armies, and many projects and no projects ... The problem is that Arafat too was reluctant, hesitant and he changed his mind, but we went a very long way.&quot; He thinks the greatest mistake Israel made was the refusal of the Likud government in 1987 to implement an agreement he negotiated with King Hussein for a joint Israeli Jordanian and Palestinian peace conference to resolve the West Bank. In his recent evidence to the Winograd commission of inquiry into the failed Lebanon war he again canvassed what he calls the Jordanian option. Ashrawi and Khatib are clear that the reason the Clinton Camp David initiative failed was that what was on offer from Ehud Barak could not have been sold to the majority of Palestinians. They emphasise that there wasn&apos;t an identifiable offer on the table. Not enough groundwork had been done. Ashrawi criticises Ariel Sharon for the handling of the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza which she says played into the hands of Hamas and marginalised the PLO by giving the impression that the way to get results with Israel is suicide bombing rather than negotiation. Both criticise Israel and the EU for the economic boycott of the West Bank following the success of Hamas in last year&apos;s elections - which has increased poverty and set back development. Of the three main obstacles to peace, the one which Ashrawi and Khatib are most optimistic about is the issue of Israeli settlements. Although they view the current trend of expansion as calculated to cut the West Bank into two and make it unviable as the basis for a Palestinian state, they could contemplate a land swap in which the main settlements near the Israeli border would be allowed to remain in exchange for land of equal quality and quantity from inside Israel. Surprisingly, neither of them sees the right of return as insuperable. To them its chief importance is symbolic. The Palestinians want a public acknowledgement of what Ashrawi calls their &quot;narrative&quot;- the fact that the Palestinians are a people and a nation like any other who have been dispossessed of their right to a national homeland. &quot;The Palestinian narrative has to be validated for them to feel that they&apos;re not constantly treated like second-class human beings outside the domain of human as well as moral and legal consideration. And Israel&apos;s culpability has to be recognised there.&quot; If that is done the right of return could be accommodated by compensation and need not involve the physical return of large numbers of Palestinians to pre 1948 borders. It is the status of Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state that seems to be the most intractable issue. On one point all three are agreed. One of the main obstacles to peace is the Israeli electoral system with its inbuilt bias towards coalition governments of short duration. As Ehud Barak found to his cost after Camp David and Shimon Peres found when he tried to make peace with Syria in 1996 after the assassination of Yitzak Rabin the window of opportunity for reaching an acceptable agreement is perilously short. Both were defeated in general elections within months. In his Winograd evidence Shimon Peres predicted that there would be nuclear weapons in the Middle East within five to 10 years. &quot;Since we cannot prevent the penetration of nuclear weapons, we need to prevent the reasons for attacking us and in other words reach a full peace in the near future&quot;. He professes to be an optimist. He still expects to see a Palestinian state in his lifetime. But his words bear a striking resemblance to what he said in 1994 when he accepted his Nobel Peace prize: &quot;Territorial frontiers are no obstacle to ballistic missiles and no weapon can shield a nation from a nuclear device. Today the battle for survival must be based on political wisdom and moral vision no less than on military might.&quot; That was 13 years, one intifada and one Lebanon war ago - and a permanent peace seems as far away as ever.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-06T19:00:00Z", "title": "1967: A shared, if distant, goal", "sentences": ["The group of boisterous twentysomething girls we sat next to watching the England-Israel football match in a Tel Aviv bar had little awareness of or interest in what is happening in the West Bank."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/06/asharedifdistantgoal"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "&quot;The year 1967 is not over. It is still with us today,&quot; remarked Israeli journalist Tom Segev in a talk this week about his book just published in English, 1967: Israel, The War, and the Year that Transformed the Middle East. Segev was referring to the situation between Israel and the Palestinians, and to the lack of clarity within Israeli society regarding its national priorities. Forty years after Israel&apos;s Six Day War, the notice of the anniversary is being marked in Israel and worldwide less for Israel&apos;s military victory and more for the repercussions of the war, especially regarding the Palestinian occupation. But, the 1967 war also led to a complete transformation of Israeli society that few in Israel anticipated. Certainly, the political leadership didn&apos;t anticipate it; one after-effect of the war was the rise of a right-wing populist electorate that rode Menachem Begin to power in 1977, pretty much up-ending the hegemony of the Labour Party and its allies up to the present day, the exceptions being the short reigns of Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak (Shimon Peres was prime minister also, but only in a unity government rotating with Yitzhak Shamir). The Jewish settlers who live outside the pre-1967 Israeli borders like to compare their mission to that of the earlier generation of Jews who founded and fostered the kibbutz movement. But while it&apos;s true that both groups represent strains of Zionism and that each has had influence beyond its numbers on the direction of Israel, the missions of the settlers and those who established the collective settlements known as kibbutzim couldn&apos;t be further apart. The kibbutz movement&apos;s vision of a just Israel was considered much more important than a specific plot of land. Kibbutz members never saw land as a divine right. One of the early missions of the movement was to settle the area, but once the 1948 boundary was agreed on as part of the UN partition plan, several kibbutzim that found themselves outside the international lines disbanded and reformed inside the recognized borders. After the Six Day War, the kibbutz movement published a book called, in Hebrew, Siach Lochamim. It was translated into English as The Seventh Day. It&apos;s a series of rather raw interviews with soldiers who fought in the war, all of them from the kibbutz movement, interviewed by various writers, among them a young novelist just making a name for himself - Amos Oz. The book captures not only the experience of youth in wartime, but also the cusp of a change regarding Israel&apos;s national priorities. That shift is only hinted at in this book, because the majority of kibbutz members, as representatives of an elite &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; class in Israel, simply didn&apos;t see their own downfall in the seeds of the 1967 War. They didn&apos;t see that Labour hegemony, secularism and the value system represented by the kibbutzim were all about to be overshadowed by the rise of the West Bank settler movement. But the tensions then emerging in Israeli society were questioned by several of the soldiers. One soldier tells Oz: &quot;The whole country, all the newspapers, everyone&apos;s talking about &apos;liberation.&apos; &apos;Look, we&apos;re there.&apos; &apos;these places are ours.&apos; &apos;After two thousand years, it&apos;s ours&apos;...&apos;the Cave of Machpela&apos;. Yet I didn&apos;t feel a thing when I was there...&quot; Oz tells the soldier: &quot;Listen, I was moved when I was at the [Western] Wall [in Jerusalem]. But I was a thousand times more moved when I saw Shai, my best friend in Hulda [the kibbutz where Oz lived then], alive and safe after the war.&quot; The kibbutz movement never included more than 4% of the Israeli population, but it was a vehicle for social transformation. The settlement movement, on the other hand, began outside the law and has never been embraced by the society as a whole; even so, it has been able to hijack Israel&apos;s national priorities. Forty years on, a majority of Israelis still say they would trade land for peace and disband settlements. Few Israelis travel to the settlements if they don&apos;t live there; only the most zealous even know where the Cave of Machpela is (it&apos;s in Hebron); they&apos;d rather hang on the beaches in Tel Aviv. Israel&apos;s capture of Jerusalem along with the biblical lands of Judea and Samaria - the occupied territories - led to the growth of a messianic religious fundamentalism that transformed the state. The growth of the extreme right-wing hard core among the settlers - especially among the young who continue to build and populate new illegal outposts - is a great danger to Israel and to the Jewish people. These settlers hold Israel hostage and are fanatical in their religious zeal. As a rule they have no belief in the modern state or rule of law but expect that redemption will come from God.

Ariel, for example, is a mini-city &quot;packed full of Russians&quot;, according to one sabra settler we interviewed. The residents are largely there for economic reasons - the subsidies provided by the government, the cheap housing on offer, and the low cost of living all played their part in persuading immigrants from the former Soviet Union to set up home in Ariel. They are not concerned with the contentious politics of the region, but rather are just looking for anywhere cheap and comfortable to call home. We have just spent a week in Kedumim. The first settlement to be set up in the Shomron region, it has mushroomed into a crowded town of over 7,000 residents. On the face of it, it appears to be a religious settlement but scratch the surface (as we did after spending five days there), and the cracks start to appear. The town has the same problems as any modern-day suburb. Bored with the rigidity of orthodox living, some of the youth have rebelled, begun to break the Sabbath laws, and now escape to the coastal cities of Netanya and Tel Aviv for nights on the town. We met two Ethiopian girls who came to Israel on Operation Shlomo, the government-sponsored airlift from Addis Ababa, and who are at boarding school in the West Bank. &quot;After all the hardship our families went through to get to Israel,&quot; said Yafa, &quot;with people dying on the trek through Sudan, and so on - why would we want to give any part of this land back?&quot; She complained about racism against the Ethiopian community by other Jews in Israel, but was quick to assert that &quot;I&apos;ll never have Arab friends - all Arabs are just too frightening&quot;. We&apos;ve met settlers who aren&apos;t religious, but their Zionist belief has led them to believe that their mere presence in the Shtachim is what fortifies the borders and protects the country. &quot;People in Tel Aviv see settlers as the ones creating the problems,&quot; said one young army captain we interviewed. &quot;But I see settlers as the true patriots. Settlers keep the war away from the main cities of Israel.&quot; And so it goes on - for another seven weeks, at least. We hope to uncover, during the course of our trip, the entire spectrum of opinion of those who live in the Shtachim - and by doing this, to put colour into a region that is too often viewed in only black and white. As two Jewish boys from north-west London, who&apos;ve grown up on a diet of Zionism and solidarity with our co-religionists in the Holy Land, this trip is a living history lesson. It is our way of finding out the mindset and mentality of those whose entire raison d&apos;etre is based on the victory of 1967, as well as those who came to live here more by chance than for any idealistic goal. It is a way to open our eyes, and the eyes of those who read our work, to what the consequences of the Six-day War are to those Israelis on the ground whose every waking moment is shaped by the battle&apos;s outcome.

It makes sense, really. If you don&apos;t know what to do with a wandering people, put them on ice. This is Michael Chabon&apos;s counterfactual notion in his almost ecstatically smart and sassy new novel. Philip Roth gave the Jews an alternative history in The Plot Against America by forging a German-American alliance under the boy&apos;s-own hero President Lindbergh. Chabon&apos;s twisted vision is no less grim, and somehow more credible: a Jewish settlement that might be the Lower East Side or Tel Aviv, but with glaciers and bears. The novel opens just before the Sitka agreement has come to an end, as the area prepares to return to Alaskan control. The Jews have no idea who will be able to stay and who will have to find another place to go. Some are heading for Madagascar. Mostly, though, they are waiting to see what will happen. Familiar and strange. This, you might think, is substantial enough material to sustain a novel, but Chabon is a ventriloquist of a writer, a genre-player, and he has wedded his upturned reality to a hard-boiled detective novel with the ghost of Philip Marlowe hovering over every page. Raymond Chandler&apos;s Marlowe, that great hero of American sentiment, may not have seemed very Jewish, but in Chabon&apos;s hands, his avatar, Meyer Landsman, has all the recognisable downbeat, hopeless qualities of the tarnished Californian knight: self-loathing, loneliness, dark wit, a drink problem, a secret honour code, and a covert longing for what is right. So, why not Walter Matthau as Philip Marlowe? The crime is murder but it is not a simple murder, just as no murder is simple murder in noir fiction. The clues add up to that ever-satisfying spiralling solution: the world-altering, government-sponsored conspiracy. At the centre of this tangled world lies Zimbalist - also known as the boundary maven - a spider at the centre of the Jewish web, who maintains the eruv, a network of poles and strings which stand for an enclosing wall of a vast notional interior so that religious Jews can sidestep the Sabbath rules. The dead body is that of the Tzaddik Ha-Dor, a man with the potential to be the messiah, who is born into every generation just in case the time is right. The time not being right, this son of ultra-orthodox Hasidic gangsters became instead a charismatic junkie who used his tefillin for a tourniquet and played masterly chess for the price of a fix. Meyer Landsman is the cop who lived down the hall and whose miserable existence can only be redeemed by attempting to solve the murder. His reasoning is the distilled essence of Marlowe, Lew Archer and Sam Spade: &quot;Somebody came into this hotel, my hotel, and shot that man in the back of the head while he was off in dreamland. And that bothers me ... All these hard-lucks paying rent on a pull-down bed and a sheet of steel bolted to the bathroom wall, for better or worse, they&apos;re my people now. I can&apos;t honestly say I like them very much ... But I&apos;ll be damned if I&apos;m going to let somebody walk in here and put a bullet in their heads.&quot; Before exposing the soft, utopian heart of the detective who understands (and makes us understand) that the worst that can happen to him as an individual is much less important than maintaining integrity, the worldwide conspiracy has to be revealed. And it&apos;s a lulu that brings the real world back with a bang, combining the messianic requirements of the Jews for the rebuilding of the Temple with the American religious right&apos;s passion for the end days of Revelation, tossed together, perhaps, with a drizzle of oil. We&apos;re talking about Jerusalem. And about a conspiracy of powerful forces of vested interests that has much to do with current events in the Middle East. Chabon is a spectacular writer. He does a witty turn reinventing Yiddish for the modern Alaskan Jews - of course the lingua franca of Jews without an Israel - just a little of which I, with only faintly remembered childhood Yiddish, could grasp. A mobile phone is a shoyfer (perhaps because, like the ram&apos;s horn, it calls you), a gun is a sholem (a Yiddish version of a Peacemaker?). Chabon is a language magician, turning everything into something else just for the delight of playing tricks with words. He takes the wry, underbelly vision of the ordinary that the best of noir fiction offers and ratchets it up to the limit. Nothing is allowed to be itself; all people and events are observed as an echo of something else. Voices are like &quot;an onion rolling in a bucket&quot;, or rusty forks falling. An approaching motorcycle is &quot;a heavy wrench clanging against a cold cement floor. The flatulence of a burst balloon streaking across the living room and knocking over a lamp.&quot; Chabon&apos;s ornate prose makes Chandler&apos;s fruity observations of the world look quite plain. Nothing is described as just the way it is. Nothing is let be. He writes like a dream and has you laughing out loud, applauding the fun he has with language and the way he takes the task of a writer and runs delighted rings around it. For the most part, Chabon&apos;s writing serves the knotted mystery that is being unravelled, but there is eventually a point where it begins to weary the mind, where the elaborations of things get in the way of the things themselves and the narrative gets sucked under by style. The compulsory paragraph of Byzantine physical description whenever another character arrives on the scene starts to seem an irritating interlude; another over-reaching cadenza. Though it seems churlish to complain about such a vivid talent, a little less would have been enough already. \u00b7 Jenny Diski&apos;s latest book, On Trying to Keep Still, is out in paperback published by Virago", "publicationDate": "2007-06-09T22:20:44Z", "title": "Review: The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Chabon", "sentences": ["Chabon&apos;s twisted vision is no less grim, and somehow more credible: a Jewish settlement that might be the Lower East Side or Tel Aviv, but with glaciers and bears."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/09/fiction.raymondchandler"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Islam", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The style of questioning at Tel Aviv airport seems deliberately designed to test a person&apos;s patience and level of tolerance in the face of insults. My story is not the first, nor is it likely to be the last told about Israel. However, my experience there was worse than I could have imagine. Now I believe that Israel pursues racist policies and deliberately targets Muslims travelling there. I was held up at the airport for seven hours and repeatedly asked racist, derogatory and Islamophobic questions. I was greeted by two security personnel outside the plane. It was as though they had been tipped off to keep a look out for me simply because of my Asian appearance. That was only an initial taster of what was to come. The immigration officer at the desk relayed a message in Hebrew using her earphone and before I realised what was happening I was surround by two security officers, one of which pulled my bag off and the other took my documents. I was brought into a room where I was asked questions that were often intrusive, private and filled with insinuation as if it was a crime to come to Tel Aviv. At one stage I was even escorted to the bathroom by a security officer. When I walked into a cubicle and attempted to lock the door, the officer ordered me to keep it open. &quot;I am only following orders, please make it easy for everyone and keep the door open&quot; said the officer. Can you imagine the humiliation I felt? After five hours, the head of security came to interview me. The same questions were asked and he even tried to crack jokes to make it look normal. After further two hours of waiting in vain I was told I could enter the country. While proceeding to pick up my bags I was stopped again and interviewed by a customs officer whose behaviour was rather thuggish. Every interview seemed to be intended to belittle me. They included questions like &quot;Why does your grandfather have an Arabic name, surely you must be an Arab? Don&apos;t you think it would have been better for you to be born in the UK and face less hassle? Do you have certificate to prove that you are a genuine British citizen? Why are you a Muslim? Why is your wife not with you? Do you intend to have more children? Why is your passport new? Are you part of a religious movement?&quot;. It went on and on. I spent two weeks in Jerusalem. It has some of the most sacred and significant religious sites for all three major Abrahamic faiths claiming its ownership. Yet through the subjugation of Christian and Muslim Arabs alike, Israel controls it. They would like us believe that the city is united but this is far from the truth when people are not free to move around or visit their sites of worship. Israeli soldiers often prevent people from entering religious sites. I was stopped from entering Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, the third holiest site of Islam though after persistence and patience I managed to get in. My experience is nothing compared to what non-Jewish people of the Holy Land face every day. The natural beauty of the country is breathtaking but the Israeli government&apos;s policy towards its own non-Jewish citizens is ugly. They are treated as second class citizens; they do not enjoy the same rights. The country is deeply divided. People of different origin do not dwell in the same neighbourhood. The areas where Arab communities live, although paying the same taxes, are visibly underdeveloped. The locals say the government does not care about the Arabs. I travelled to the West Bank and saw the Palestinians living in a dire state, poverty, unemployment, hopelessness and apathy everywhere. Anger and resentment form their daily emotions. It felt like a prison for me as a traveller, so I cannot imagine how they must feel being imprisoned in their own homes. I was so shocked and in tears when I saw the wall built by the Israelis that has devastated Palestinian lives and economy. It snakes through the West Bank, almost grotesque in its ugliness. Families have been force to live on two sides of the wall and schools have been closed down because communities have been forcefully divided. I felt outraged with my government for not doing enough to prevent this. Berlin Wall came down and I believe this wall will come down too. The destruction of the former marked the beginning of the end of cold war; I hope the destruction of the latter would bring an end to the occupation of the Palestinian land and hostilities in the region. No country, no people or nation can succeed by oppressing others. Peace and security can never be obtained by erecting walls or confiscating lands. Prosperity can not be attained by causing misery to others. Daily suffering and humiliation of the Palestinians people would not make peace in the region possible.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-10T12:00:00Z", "title": "A dispatch from the frontline", "sentences": ["The style of questioning at Tel Aviv airport seems deliberately designed to test a person&apos;s patience and level of tolerance in the face of insults.", "I was brought into a room where I was asked questions that were often intrusive, private and filled with insinuation as if it was a crime to come to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/10/anisraeldispatch"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "In temperatures of more than 40 degrees, Israeli soldiers are moving in formation up the slopes of Mount Hermon in full battle dress, a few miles from the Syrian border. Down on the main plateau of the Golan Heights, new army camps are being set up and there are more military than civilian vehicles on the roads that link old battlefields and new vineyards. Despite talk of peace, both Syria and Israel are preparing for war amid mutual distrust and confusion. &quot;There has never been such a state of readiness since the 1980s and there is a great danger of a chain reaction if one sides makes a mistake in reading the other&apos;s intention,&quot; said Eyal Zisser, a strategic analyst at Tel Aviv University. Both Israel and Syria are issuing contradictory signals. In August last year, President Bashar Assad of Syria said he was interested in peace with Israel but would consider war to regain the Golan Heights, lost by Syria 40 years ago. Last week, Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, sent messages to Mr Assad that Israel was willing to give up the Golan in return for a peace deal. The messages were conveyed at the same time as the Israeli army carried out a training attack on a mock Syrian village in the south of Israel. According to Mr Zisser, the confusion is caused by Israel&apos;s uncertainty over its own desires and the intentions of President Assad. &quot;We don&apos;t know how serious Assad is regarding war or peace. There is also confusion on the domestic implications for the government. Then there is also the question of the attitude of the United States, which is currently against negotiations with Syria,&quot; he said. In the meantime the armies are training and maintaining a high state of readiness. &quot;What you can see is military preparations on both sides. Armies have their own logic. If there is a possibility of war then they prepare for it,&quot; said Mr Zisser. The 40,000 residents of the Golan continue with their work in farming and tourism, accustomed to living in a frontier province which is as marked by war as the fields of Flanders. The Golan begins at 200 metres below sea level at the Sea of the Gallilee and rises to 2,800 metres at the top of Mount Hermon. Most of the land is a gently sloping plateau guarded by eight volcanic plugs that overlook Syria. Some of the plugs are fortified and others are crowded with antennae, radar and observation equipment to monitor Syrian activity. Much of the west of the plateau is covered by Syrian minefields and every few miles there is a war memorial, old tank or derelict barracks. Half of the residents of the Golan are Druze; they retain their Syrian nationality and reject Israel&apos;s rule over them in theory, but cooperate with it in practice. Around 100,000 residents of the Golan left their homes during the 1967 war and were not allowed to return by Israel. The other half are Israeli settlers who continue to move to the Golan despite the common understanding that Israel will return it all to Syria in return for a peace deal. Albert Hecht, a Golan resident originally from Glasgow, said that there was an obvious increase in Israeli military activity. &quot;You do sense there is a military build up going on. For years there was very little training here and now they are reopening camps that have been empty for years. &quot;We are in a constant state of readiness. We were hit by a few missiles last year from Lebanon and we all have bomb shelters. We are pretty sure that if things take a turn for the worse the army will be able to evacuate us very quickly,&quot; he said. The residents of the Golan say that they live as if they will live here forever. &quot;We have built home, businesses and vineyards here. No one told us to stop growing,&quot; said Mr Hecht. The local council says that 1,500 families have moved to the region in the last five years and there is strong investment. The main town of Qatzrin has a newly built mall, featuring a micro-brewery, a winery and multimedia shows that offer a very partisan history of the Golan to tourists. Moti Bar, the manager of the micro-brewery and restaurant, said that he did not expect the talk of war to deter tourists who make a major contribution to the local economy. &quot;Israelis are used to this kind of atmosphere, they do not plan their holidays according to the news. They understand politics and that the things that appear in the news are not always as they seem. If we did not then we would have no life at all,&quot; he said. Golan settlers, unlike their counterparts in the West Bank and Gaza, are not driven by religious conviction and admit that Israeli sovereignty over the Golan could be traded for peace. Both Mr Hecht and Mr Bar said they hoped that any peace deal would involve Israel leasing back the Golan from Syria for a period of 20 to 100 years. However, the Druze residents who are clustered on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the north-east of the Golan, see the settlers&apos; work in a different light. Ayman Abu Jabel, who served 12 years in an Israeli jail for throwing a grenade at an army base, had little sympathy for the settlers. &quot;The settlements must be destroyed and the settlers must leave. It is not their land. Everything they have is stolen,&quot; he said. Mr Abu Jabel said there were economic advantages to living under Israeli occupation but added: &quot;I would be happier to have the bad things of my own country rather than the good things of Israel.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-11T11:49:57Z", "title": "Talking of peace, preparing for war", "sentences": ["&quot;There has never been such a state of readiness since the 1980s and there is a great danger of a chain reaction if one sides makes a mistake in reading the other&apos;s intention,&quot; said Eyal Zisser, a strategic analyst at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/11/syria.israel"}, {"tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news"], "article": "The decision by the University and College Union (UCU) to consider a boycott of Israel is the latest manifestation of a broader process which has been steadily gathering speed in the last half-decade: the converging of opinion on the Middle East conflict among members of two camps, who might ordinarily be considered to have little in common.  The two camps are the European radical left and supporters - both in Europe and here, in the region of Islamist states and organisations. The alliance is built around a joint commitment to Israel&apos;s disappearance from the map.  Supporters of these streams sometimes gather together. The &quot;anti-war&quot; conference in Cairo in April of this year, attended by representatives of Hamas, Hizbullah and European extreme-left and Islamist groups, was organised jointly by the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian Socialist Revolutionary party. Leaders of Respect - that joint venture of far-leftists and Muslim Brothers - were also in attendance. But the important crosspollination is taking place in the realm of ideas and strategies, rather than joint political organisation.  Israel&apos;s regional enemies are currently in a state of euphoria. The failures of the second Lebanon war, combined with the possibly imminent eclipse of US strategy in Iraq, and the emergence of Iran as an active sponsor and inspiration for radical Islamist organisations, have combined to produce in the region an atmosphere familiar to students of its history. This mood might aptly be termed &quot;pre-conflict euphoria&quot;. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s recent contention that the &quot;countdown to Israel&apos;s destruction has begun&quot; perfectly captures it.  A previous manifestation of this phenomenon in the region took place in the period between Saddam Hussein&apos;s invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990, and his expulsion from there in Operation Desert Storm in January 1991. The atmosphere in Arab capitals prior to the war of June 1967, and the lionisation of the Palestinian guerrillas in 1968-70 are similar instances. On all these occasions, broad swathes of the intelligentsia and the people of a number of regional states came to believe that after many failures, they had finally found the blueprint for defeating Israel, and undoing the shame inherent in its creation.  Today, among those states, organisations and people in the region who reject Israel&apos;s continued existence, there is a perception that the correct strategy for producing the eventual demise of the Jewish state has been found. The new strategy has been likened to the antique far-left doctrine of &quot;prolonged popular war&quot;.  According to this view, conventional battlefield confrontation is only one of a variety of means to be employed to achieve the desired end. Ongoing, demoralising guerrilla attacks, which sap will and morale, the constant maintenance of conflict - with the intention of preventing successful societal development, and a parallel political strategy of delegitimisation and isolation - are all key ingredients. The perceived combination of sophistication and indefatigability represented by Hizbullah in Lebanon is a key model and source of inspiration in this.  Victory here is not predicated on a Syrian armored column entering Tel Aviv. The intention is to gradually whittle away at the various components of Israel&apos;s strength. The goal is to make of Israel a &quot;failed state&quot;, in which the pursuit of normal life becomes impossible. This is where the various international delegitimisation initiatives come in. Initiatives such as the UCU boycott are the result of the efforts of a fairly small number of people. The anti-Israel boycott campaign offers a chance for activists of fringe political organisations to &quot;punch above their weight&quot; and for a moment take centre stage. The people behind the latest move in Britain, for example, are members of a small far-left party - the Socialist Workers party. But such figures have been able to emerge from eccentric obscurity precisely because of the current febrile mood regarding Israel and the Middle East conflict among significant parts of educated British opinion.  Thrilled by the militant challenge offered by the popular war strategy and its supporters, the boycotters wish to cast themselves in the mould of the anti-Vietnam war and anti-apartheid campaigners of the past. They will do their bit by cutting the ties of support linking the enemy entity to its western backers through commerce, trade, and cultural and educational links. Israel, in the analogy, is to play the unflattering role of Thieu&apos;s doomed South Vietnamese republic, or the apartheid regime.  Ultimately, the followers of the strategy of prolonged popular war and their international cheerleaders are advocates of failed ideologies, backed by states whose achievements in the field of societal and economic development are modest in the extreme. Previous outbreaks of pre-conflict euphoria in 1967, 1970 and 1990-91, ended in defeat and humiliation. In all three of the previous cases cited, however, it is worth noting that the mood eventually faded as a result of a decisive military humiliation suffered by its main protagonists. This time, hopefully, another way will be found in time to deflate the ugly, politicidal alliance now gathering strength.  \u00b7 Jonathan Spyer is a senior research fellow at the Global Research in International Affairs Center in Herzliya, Israel", "publicationDate": "2007-06-11T11:57:45Z", "title": "Isolation tactics are not the answer", "sentences": ["Victory here is not predicated on a Syrian armored column entering Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/11/highereducation.uk2"}, {"tags": [], "article": "The road map has been turned into an origami dead duck. On the front pages of today&apos;s carbon-rich edition of the Guardian are details of a leaked report from the UN&apos;s recently resigned special representative for the Middle East, Alvaro de Soto. His cogent and well-substantiated report, intended for internal consumption, in effect told the UN to put up or shut up over the peace process. But despite the UN&apos;s weaknesses, the pandering to Washington and Israel, and the apparent indisposition of the current secretary general to take any independent stand at all, the UN is essential to the peace process. Around the time of the Oslo accords, the realists of the PLO realised that, far more than any amount of &quot;armed struggle&quot;, their best defence was international law and the UN. After all, no one, even now, recognises the occupation of East Timor and Western Sahara even though there have been times when they were, if not quite dead, about as lively as the Monty Python parrot on the international agenda. Once the Arabs and the Palestinians could swallow the injustice, but undoubted legality, of the 1948 resolution that partitioned Palestine, they looked to the United Nations as the embodiment of international law and they had some reasons for hoping for success. After all, less than a fistful of (bribed) banana republics had ever set up a mission in West Jerusalem, or recognised it as Israel&apos;s capital. Even the US, despite unremitting pressure from the lobby in Congress, still has not moved its mission to Israel from Tel Aviv. Until the UN, that is the nations of the world, decides differently, Jerusalem is UN territory. And under 242 and subsequent resolutions, East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights are also occupied territory, and Israel is bound by the Geneva conventions in its behaviour there. Which is why the settlements are illegal. Since then, under the various peace plans, while demanding that the Palestinians deliver every jot and tittle of their commitments, the Israelis have persistently ignored theirs, by building and &quot;strengthening&quot; settlements, and by building the wall through the Occupied Territories in defiance of the judgment of the international court of justice. The US&apos;s position as interlocutor was hopelessly compromised, even though the Palestinian leadership has clung to the forlorn hope that somehow, someday, it will exercise restraint on the Israelis. The Israelis wanted nothing to do with the UN, and in the old days, the Russians could be relied upon to stand for some semblance of Palestinian rights. Indeed, when the Quartet was set up, even the European Union was balanced in its approach and recognised the need to respect international law. None of that is true any more. The Russians are tougher about Orthodox communion with Serbia than about any residual anti-imperialist solidarity with the Palestinians. Under British influence, the EU has become an echo chamber for Washington, mesmerised by the word &quot;terrorism.&quot; Everyone wants to get Washington off their backs. That leaves the UN. For two years Kofi Annan tried to walk a tightrope. He balanced between encouraging the Israelis to come into the UN fold both because he thought it was the right thing to do, and because it drew the fangs of one of the most important partners in the rabid anti-UN claques on the Hill. Engaging the US was an understandable goal for the secretary general - it is difficult to run a world organisation if the biggest power in the world is not cooperating. Annan tried keep Israel and Washington happy, but he also realised that international law and UN decisions had to be respected. And even he pandered, as de Soto points out, forbidding his own special representative to contact Hamas, or Damascus, although there was not a single UN body had agreed on such a policy. Now the Quartet has become an international fig leaf for Israeli non-compliance with international law, implicitly condoning Israel&apos;s refusal to hand over tax revenues, its strangulation of the faltering Palestinian economy, its settlement expansion, its roadblocks and armed attacks against Palestinian power stations and infrastructure. The parties to the Quartet are now condoning Israeli behaviour that before 9/11 they were condemning in the security council. De Soto, quite correctly called on the secretary general to stand up for the UN charter, for international law, and for the decisions of his own organisation. Instead, or rather because, he, and likeminded people have been frozen out, and UN staff say that Ban Ki Moon sees Israel as South Korea and the Palestinians as North Korea. The secretary general should reappraise that view soon. The only viable two-state solution, as accepted by most of the Arabs, and a significant proportion of Israelis, depends upon acceptance of 242, and the 1967 boundaries. There can be haggling - after the acceptance, but without the United Nations, in the sense of the whole world community, Israel will never have recognised borders, and therefore cannot ever hope to have secure boundaries, or peace. If the secretary general of the United Nations cannot stand up against the US, for the &quot;unique&quot; legitimacy which is the organisation&apos;s only weapon, then it does not bode well for its peacemaking efforts anywhere in the world.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-13T10:30:00Z", "title": "How to get the road map on track", "sentences": ["Even the US, despite unremitting pressure from the lobby in Congress, still has not moved its mission to Israel from Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/13/howtogettheroadmapontrack"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ehud Barak"], "article": "The former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was today elected leader of the Israeli Labour party, the second largest party in the country&apos;s governing coalition. Mr Barak, who lost a general election six years ago to Ariel Sharon&apos;s Likud party, is expected to make a bid to return to the top job, but will first take a seat in the cabinet of the current prime minister, Ehud Olmert. Mr Barak has repeatedly cast himself as the only Labour politician able to defeat Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the opposition Likud party and currently the most popular Israeli politician in opinion polls. In the party election, Mr Barak won 51.2% of the vote, against 47.8% for Ami Ayalon, a former navy commander and head of Israel&apos;s internal security service. At a victory gathering early today at the Labour headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Barak called for unity and pledged to restore Israel&apos;s military might and deterrent power. He pledged a policy that &quot;combines uncompromising security, protecting Israel&apos;s solidarity and democracy, a determined pursuit of real peace, the reinforcement of the rule of law and healing Israeli society&quot;. Mr Barak is likely to replace Amir Peretz, the outgoing party leader, as defence minister in Israel&apos;s ruling coalition government. While he has criticised Ehud Olmert, who leads the Kadima party, he is not expected to pull Labour out of the coalition. Analysts disagree about the extent to which Mr Barak&apos;s victory might alter Israeli government policies. Labour has only 19 seats in the 78-seat, five-party coalition, which means even if the party decides to pull out of the government, Mr Olmert may be able to survive in his post by forging new alliances. Yesterday&apos;s vote marks the first return to politics for Mr Barak since he left in early 2001, after two years as prime minister.

Mr Barak, 65, is a former commando and army chief of staff, who is Israel&apos;s most decorated soldier. He beat Ami Ayalon, a former navy commander, for the leadership of the Labour party. At a victory gathering at the Labour party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Barak called for unity and pledged to restore Israel&apos;s military might and deterrent power, badly dented after the conflict in Lebanon last year. He pledged to pursue a policy that &quot;combines uncompromising security, protecting Israel&apos;s solidarity and democracy, a determined pursuit of real peace, the reinforcement of the rule of law and healing Israeli society.&quot; As head of Israel&apos;s second biggest party, Mr Barak will now have his eye on the job of prime minister, a post he held for almost two years between 1999 and 2001. Mr Barak has called on the deeply unpopular Ehud Olmert to resign after an official report criticised the prime minister&apos;s handling of a war against Hizbullah guerrillas in Lebanon last year. But Mr Barak is expected to keep Labour in Mr Olmert&apos;s coalition government, where he is likely to replace Amir Peretz, the outgoing Labour leader, as head of the ministry of defence. Labour ministers do not want to jeopardise their jobs in a coalition realignment or in an early election because the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party hold a strong lead in the polls. Asked by a voter yesterday how he was different from Mr Netanyahu, Mr Barak, using his rival&apos;s nickname, said, &quot;Bibi is a bad person who walks all over people. I do not walk all over people.&quot; During his brief tenure as prime minister, Mr Barak unilaterally withdrew Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, ending an 18-year Israeli occupation. It was a bold political and military gamble, but the decision was criticised for boosting Hizbullah&apos;s stock and allowing the Shia military forces to grow. Mr Barak also came tantalisingly close to a peace deal with the Palestinians in detailed negotiations at Camp David in 2000. He held marathon talks with the former PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, but the two sides could not reach agreement despite the best efforts of the then US president Bill Clinton, playing honest broker. The second Palestinian uprising, or intifada, soon followed - and continued up to and beyond the final Barak-Clinton-Arafat meeting in January 2001. In the ensuing recriminations, Mr Barak claimed he had exposed &quot;Mr Arafat&apos;s true intentions&quot;. Mr Barak entered the Israeli parliament in 1996 and served in various ministries, including foreign and defence. After losing the 2001 elections to Mr Sharon in a landslide, Mr Barak worked in the private sector. His employers included the US company Electronic Data Systems, where he is reported to have made a small fortune.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-13T15:18:13Z", "title": "Profile: Ehud Barak, new leader of the Labour party in Israel", "sentences": ["At a victory gathering at the Labour party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Barak called for unity and pledged to restore Israel&apos;s military might and deterrent power, badly dented after the conflict in Lebanon last year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/13/israel4"}, {"tags": ["Politics"], "article": "The spiralling pressures of Labour&apos;s almost unbearably exciting deputy leadership contest may, we fear, finally be getting to dear Hazza Harman MP.

Zeeshan Siddiqui, 26, escaped from a mental health unit in Belmarsh prison, south-east London, last October after jumping out of a window. But it is only after the Observer today contested an order banning the paper from identifying Siddiqui that the High Court ruled he could be named. At the recent &apos;fertiliser bomb&apos; plot trial in which five men were jailed for planning explosions at a range of locations including the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent and the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London, the court heard how Mr Siddiqui - referred to as &apos;Imran&apos; - had been approached by the gang to become a suicide bomber. But Mr Siddiqui broke away from the group after apparently doubting their sincerity to proceed with the plan. The Observer has established that Mr Siddiqui was interviewed by MI6 in Pakistan before returning to the UK where he was subsequently placed under a control order. His diary, which was allegedly written while in Pakistan, was obtained by the New York Times. It includes a reference to how the world has become a &apos;battliefield for the Muslims.&apos; Pakistan intelligence also allegedly found telephone numbers of several senior members of al-Qaida. He has denied all links to terrorism and claims the diary was faked, but he has admitted spending time with Mohammed Junaid Babar, who pleaded guilty to supplying terror training equipment to al-Qaida and who became an informer against the &apos;fertiliser bomb&apos; plotters. Mr Siddiqui also allegedly admitted to his interrogators in Pakistan that he spent two years fighting in Afghanistan and Kashmir. In 1997, Mr Siddiqui, who is believed to be suffering from depression, left Britain to join the mujahideen in Lebanon, according to a newspaper report, but he returned to his parents a month later. He attended the same college as Asif Muhammad Hanif who blew himself up in the suicide bombing of a bar in Tel Aviv in 2003. They are believed to have been close friends. Mr Siddiqui, from Hounslow, west London, also allegedly met with at least one of the 7/7 bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, at a terror training camp in Pakistan, but this has not been confirmed. He once told an interviewer: &apos;I have never taken part in any terrorist activity nor do I support or ever intend to support any terrorist activities.&apos; After he absconded, breaking his control order, the Home Office denied that the former London Underground, employee was a threat to national security. However, the Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, admitted to parliament two months ago that his may not be the case. Mr Siddiqui&apos;s lawyer told the Observer that Mr Siddiqui was tortured and suffered the loss of sight in one eye while in Pakistan.

Zeeshan Siddiqui, 26, escaped from a mental health unit in Hounslow, west London, last October after jumping out of a window. His identity had been concealed by the courts, but a judge lifted an anonymity order after an application by the Guardian Newspaper Group. During the recent terrorism trial, in which five men were jailed for plotting a series of fertiliser bomb attacks in the south-east of England, the jury heard that Mr Siddiqui - referred to as Imran - was asked to carry out a suicide attack on the underground, where he worked as a cleaner. The court was told he had rejected the idea because he thought the gang members were not serious. Mr Siddiqui, the son of a Heathrow airport worker and a supply teacher, was born in London and grew up Hounslow in the west of the city. He became involved with al-Muhajiroun, the Islamist organisation established by Omar Bakri Muhammad, the fundamentalist cleric banned from re-entering Britain in the wake of the July 7 attacks in London. Among his friends, both at college and in al-Muhajiroun, was Asif Hanif, who killed himself and three others in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv in May 2003. Mr Siddiqui, who has a history of mental illness, vanished from his home shortly after that attack. He is now known to have travelled to Pakistan, where he attended terrorism training camps. He trained alongside members of the fertiliser gang. Mr Siddiqui was arrested in May 2005 in Peshawar by the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI, and later alleged that he underwent weeks of torture. The control order was imposed when he was eventually freed and deported to the UK. Detectives defended an earlier decision to back an anonymity order claiming there was a &quot;clear operational advantage&quot; in concealing his identity as they followed up initial leads.

At a glance, things aren&apos;t going well for Israel. But here&apos;s a puzzle: why, in the midst of such chaos and carnage, is the Israeli economy booming like it&apos;s 1999, with a roaring stock market and growth rates nearing China&apos;s? Thomas Friedman recently offered his theory in the New York Times. Israel &quot;nurtures and rewards individual imagination&quot;, and so its people are constantly spawning ingenious hi-tech start-ups, no matter what messes their politicians are making. After perusing class projects by students in engineering and computer science at Ben-Gurion University, Friedman made one of his famous fake-sense pronouncements. Israel &quot;had discovered oil&quot;. This oil, apparently, is located in the minds of Israel&apos;s &quot;young innovators and venture capitalists&quot;, who are too busy making megadeals with Google to be held back by politics. Here&apos;s another theory. Israel&apos;s economy isn&apos;t booming despite the political chaos that devours the headlines but because of it. This phase of development dates back to the mid-90s, when the country was in the vanguard of the information revolution - the most tech-dependent economy in the world. After the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, Israel&apos;s economy was devastated, facing its worst year since 1953. Then came 9/11, and suddenly new profit vistas opened up for any company that claimed it could spot terrorists in crowds, seal borders from attack, and extract confessions from closed-mouthed prisoners. Within three years, large parts of Israel&apos;s tech economy had been radically repurposed. Put in Friedmanesque terms, Israel went from inventing the networking tools of the &quot;flat world&quot; to selling fences to an apartheid planet. Many of the country&apos;s most successful entrepreneurs are using Israel&apos;s status as a fortressed state, surrounded by furious enemies, as a kind of 24-hour-a-day showroom, a living example of how to enjoy relative safety amid constant war. And the reason Israel is now enjoying supergrowth is that those companies are busily exporting that model to the world. Discussions of Israel&apos;s military trade usually focus on the flow of weapons into the country - US-made Caterpillar bulldozers used to destroy homes in the West Bank, and British companies supplying parts for F-16s. Overlooked is Israel&apos;s huge and expanding export business. Israel now sends $1.2bn in &quot;defence&quot; products to the United States - up dramatically from $270m in 1999. In 2006, Israel exported $3.4bn in defence products - well over a billion more than it received in American military aid. That makes Israel the fourth largest arms dealer in the world, overtaking Britain. Much of this growth has been in the so-called homeland security sector. Before 9/11 homeland security barely existed as an industry. By the end of this year, Israeli exports in the sector will reach $1.2bn, an increase of 20%. The key products and services are hi-tech fences, unmanned drones, biometric IDs, video and audio surveillance gear, air passenger profiling and prisoner interrogation systems - precisely the tools and technologies Israel has used to lock in the occupied territories. And that is why the chaos in Gaza and the rest of the region doesn&apos;t threaten the bottom line in Tel Aviv, and may actually boost it. Israel has learned to turn endless war into a brand asset, pitching its uprooting, occupation and containment of the Palestinian people as a half-century head start in the &quot;global war on terror&quot;. It&apos;s no coincidence that the class projects at Ben-Gurion that so impressed Friedman have names like Innovative Covariance Matrix for Point Target Detection in Hyperspectral Images, and Algorithms for Obstacle Detection and Avoidance. Thirty homeland security companies have been launched in Israel during the past six months alone, thanks in large part to lavish government subsidies that have transformed the Israeli army and the country&apos;s universities into incubators for security and weapons start-ups - something to keep in mind in the debates about the academic boycott. Next week, the most established of these companies will travel to Europe for the Paris Air Show, the arms industry&apos;s equivalent of Fashion Week. One of the Israeli companies exhibiting is Suspect Detection Systems (SDS), which will be showcasing its Cogito1002, a white, sci-fi-looking security kiosk that asks air travellers to answer a series of computer-generated questions, tailored to their country of origin, while they hold their hand on a &quot;biofeedback&quot; sensor. The device reads the body&apos;s reactions to the questions, and certain responses flag the passenger as &quot;suspect&quot;. Like hundreds of other Israeli security start-ups, SDS boasts that it was founded by veterans of Israel&apos;s secret police and that its products were road-tested on Palestinians. Not only has the company tried out the biofeedback terminals at a West Bank checkpoint, it claims the &quot;concept is supported and enhanced by knowledge acquired and assimilated from the analysis of thousands of case studies related to suicide bombers in Israel&quot;. Another star of the Paris Air Show will be Israeli defence giant Elbit, which plans to showcase its Hermes 450 and 900 unmanned air vehicles. As recently as last month, according to press reports, Israel used the drones on bombing missions in Gaza. Once tested in the territories, they are exported abroad: the Hermes has already been used at the Arizona-Mexico border; Cogito1002 terminals are being auditioned at an unnamed American airport; and Elbit - also one of the companies behind Israel&apos;s &quot;security barrier&quot; - has set up a deal with Boeing to construct the Department of Homeland Security&apos;s $2.5bn &quot;virtual&quot; border fence around the US. Since Israel began its policy of sealing off the occupied territories with checkpoints and walls, human rights activists have often compared Gaza and the West Bank to open-air prisons. But in researching the explosion of Israel&apos;s homeland security sector, a topic explored in greater detail in my forthcoming book, it strikes me that they are something else too: laboratories where the terrifying tools of our security states are being field-tested. Palestinians - whether living in the West Bank or what the Israeli politicians are already calling Hamastan - are no longer just targets. They are guinea pigs. So in a way Friedman is right, Israel has struck oil. But the oil isn&apos;t the imagination of its techie entrepreneurs. The oil is the war on terror, the state of constant fear that creates a bottomless global demand for devices that watch, listen, contain and target &quot;suspects&quot;. And fear, it turns out, is the ultimate renewable resource.  \u00b7 Naomi Klein&apos;s new book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, will be published later this year by Picador; a version of this article appears in the Nation, www.thenation.com and www.nologo.org.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T23:08:18Z", "title": "Naomi Klein: How war was turned into a brand", "sentences": ["And that is why the chaos in Gaza and the rest of the region doesn&apos;t threaten the bottom line in Tel Aviv, and may actually boost it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/16/israel.comment1"}, {"tags": ["UK news", "Football"], "article": "Two current and one former Premiership manager and the country&apos;s most powerful agent have been named in the biggest corruption inquiry into football in 10 years. A 15-month investigation into irregular payments in the transfer market by Quest, the company run by the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens, found no direct evidence of illegal payments to club officials by agents - &quot;bungs&quot; in football parlance - but said suspicions remained over the probity of 17 deals and the agents involved. The report states: &quot;There is no evidence of any irregular payments to club officials or players and they are identified here only as a consequence of the outstanding issues the inquiry has with the agents identified.&quot; Lord Stevens has passed his findings to the Football Association and the world governing body, Fifa, and charges under football&apos;s regulations could follow. Details of one transfer, which has not been made public, have been passed to a statutory agency, thought to be the City of London police, who are conducting a separate inquiry into suspected criminal offences. Lord Stevens was commissioned by the Premier League in the wake of allegations of corruption by Sven-Goran Eriksson, the former England manager. His inquiry confirms that the transfer system at the highest level is open to abuse, and highlights &quot;slack administration&quot; and &quot;unacceptable levels of compliance&quot; at some clubs. Of the 17 deals still under suspicion, three involve the transfers of Chelsea&apos;s Michael Essien, Petr Cech and Didier Drogba, the latter two of which are among five deals conducted by agent Pini Zahavi that are still under investigation. Mr Zahavi, an Israeli former journalist, who has been dubbed the &quot;super-agent&quot; because of his involvement in multimillion pound transfer deals, was said by Lord Stevens to have &quot;failed to fully cooperate with the inquiry&quot;. He initially failed to reveal his involvement in certain deals, did not disclose bank statements that might reveal a money trail and failed to respond to further inquiries. The report also raises serious questions about the conduct of two serving and one former Premiership manager. Sam Allardyce, the former Bolton boss now in charge at Newcastle United, is identified as having a potential conflict of interest with his son Craig during his time at the Reebok Stadium. Craig Allardyce, then an agent, was involved in three player transfers to Bolton while his father was manager, and these are among the transfers under suspicion. Pointedly, the report declares that only those &quot;currently&quot; at Bolton have been cleared of wrongdoing. Craig Allardyce responded to the report through his solicitor: &quot;Craig is pleased that Lord Stevens confirmed that there is no evidence or suggestion of any irregular payments to Bolton Wanderers FC or those involved with the club.&quot; Lord Stevens also raises concerns about the Portsmouth manager, Harry Redknapp, and his relationship with agent Willy McKay, who was involved in five of the deals highlighted in the inquiry. Mr McKay told the inquiry team that he registered a racehorse in Redknapp&apos;s name, and while Lord Stevens found no evidence that the deal was linked to a specific transfer, he recommends &quot;inquiries into this matter should continue&quot;. The inquiry also questions evidence provided by Graeme Souness, the former Newcastle manager, and Kenneth Shepherd, son of the chairman Freddie Shepherd. Three transfers conducted by that regime - those of Emre Belozoglu, Jean Alain Boumsong and Amady Faye - remain under suspicion. Souness said yesterday: &quot;I cannot understand why my name features in this report. I volunteered full information to Quest as a witness and I have heard nothing further from them.&quot; In total, Lord Stevens implicates five Premiership clubs in transfers about which doubts remain. Bolton, Portsmouth, Chelsea and Middlesbrough are named as well as Newcastle. In 13 of the 16 deals detailed yesterday, the selling club was outside England. Portsmouth were the selling club in all three domestic transfers, Ayegbeni Yakubu to Middlesbrough, Amady Faye to Newcastle and Alliou Cisse to Birmingham. In response to the report, Mr Zahavi&apos;s lawyer Ehud Shochatovitch said: &quot;My client believes he has been targeted because he is successful and enjoys a high profile in the football world. There is no doubt that Quest&apos;s findings are unfounded and arbitrary and that Quest misused its powers, exceeded its authority and overstepped the scope of the inquiry.&quot; The Portsmouth club said: &quot;We have always acted in accordance with Premier League rules and have cooperated fully with the investigation.&quot; Redknapp dismissed his ownership of Mr McKay&apos;s horse as &quot;purely a PR exercise.&quot; Deals in the spotlight Lord Stevens&apos; yesterday highlighted five Premiership clubs, three current or former Premiership managers, 14 agents and 17 transfer deals* at the culmination of his inquiry: ClubsBolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Chelsea Managers Sam Allardyce, Harry Redknapp, Graeme Souness TransfersCollins Mbesuma Kaiser Chiefs to Portsmouth; Ayegbeni Yakubu Portsmouth to Middlesbrough \u00a37.5m; Fabio Rochemback Sporting Lisbon to Middlesbrough; Didier Drogba Marseille to Chelsea \u00a324m; Petr Cech Rennes to Chelsea \u00a37m; Ali Al-Habsi Lynn Oslo to Bolton Free; Tal Ben Haim Macabi Tel Aviv to Bolton \u00a3150,000; Blessing Kaku MS Ashdod to Bolton; Julio Correia: Jean Alain Boumsong: Rangers to Newcastle \u00a38m; Albert Luque Deportive La Coruna to Newcastle \u00a39.5m; Emre Belozoglu InterMilan to Newcastle \u00a33.8m; Amady Faye: Portsmouth to Newcastle \u00a32m; Michael Essien: Lyon to Chelsea \u00a324.4m; Benjani Mwaruwari: Auxerre to Pompey \u00a34.1m; Alliou Cisse: Birmingham to Portsmouth \u00a3300,000. * A 17th deal is still being investigated", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T23:13:26Z", "title": "Bung inquiry names football's leading agents and managers", "sentences": ["There is no doubt that Quest&apos;s findings are unfounded and arbitrary and that Quest misused its powers, exceeded its authority and overstepped the scope of the inquiry.&quot; The Portsmouth club said: &quot;We have always acted in accordance with Premier League rules and have cooperated fully with the investigation.&quot; Redknapp dismissed his ownership of Mr McKay&apos;s horse as &quot;purely a PR exercise.&quot; Deals in the spotlight Lord Stevens&apos; yesterday highlighted five Premiership clubs, three current or former Premiership managers, 14 agents and 17 transfer deals* at the culmination of his inquiry: ClubsBolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Chelsea Managers Sam Allardyce, Harry Redknapp, Graeme Souness TransfersCollins Mbesuma Kaiser Chiefs to Portsmouth; Ayegbeni Yakubu Portsmouth to Middlesbrough \u00a37.5m; Fabio Rochemback Sporting Lisbon to Middlesbrough; Didier Drogba Marseille to Chelsea \u00a324m; Petr Cech Rennes to Chelsea \u00a37m; Ali Al-Habsi Lynn Oslo to Bolton Free; Tal Ben Haim Macabi Tel Aviv to Bolton \u00a3150,000; Blessing Kaku MS Ashdod to Bolton; Julio Correia: Jean Alain Boumsong: Rangers to Newcastle \u00a38m; Albert Luque Deportive La Coruna to Newcastle \u00a39.5m; Emre Belozoglu InterMilan to Newcastle \u00a33.8m; Amady Faye: Portsmouth to Newcastle \u00a32m; Michael Essien: Lyon to Chelsea \u00a324.4m; Benjani Mwaruwari: Auxerre to Pompey \u00a34.1m; Alliou Cisse: Birmingham to Portsmouth \u00a3300,000."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/16/football.paulkelso"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "It was in angry retaliation that the Premier League&apos;s quest for bungs began. There had been allegations about a culture of corruption among Premiership managers by the Football Association&apos;s highest-paid employee, Sven-Goran Eriksson, and the Premier League&apos;s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, could not abide that. So, to prove the league was clean and that it could do a better job of investigating than the organisation which paid Eriksson&apos;s wages, Scudamore set up the inquiry into 362 transfers which took place between January 2004 and January 2006. It was deeply unpopular among the shareholder clubs who are Scudamore&apos;s paymasters. That was a risk but there was a promised land at the end of it: seizing the FA&apos;s domain of governance that the Premier League had long sought for itself. But after 15\u00bd months of the process, yesterday the Premier League&apos;s revolution came full circle. Responsibility for the 16 suspicious transfers landed back in the FA&apos;s lap (concerns over the 17th outstanding deal have been deemed sufficiently serious to refer instead to the police). &quot;All outstanding matters, together with full and relevant documentation, will now be passed to the FA and Fifa who have the required powers to investigate further and consider the next appropriate steps,&quot; said the league&apos;s board, in an update to its clubs. &quot;In the event that any future evidence comes to light that involves a breach of rules then this will be dealt with by the relevant authority accordingly.&quot; This came as no surprise to the FA. It has always been the competent body in all domestic transfers. One official said slightly wearily yesterday: &quot;Exactly what we said would happen is happening. It&apos;s all coming back to us. We will look at the evidence - half of which we haven&apos;t got yet - only when we have got everything can we think about timescales. But there are serious matters to investigate here - you can&apos;t expect an immediate turnaround.&quot; The fact that Quest was enlisted in the first place was a mark of the contempt the league held for the FA&apos;s regulatory processes. But it is to Soho Square&apos;s credit that of the 16 transfers exposed by Quest&apos;s final report yesterday, only two involved English clubs at both ends of the deal: Yakubu Ayegbeni&apos;s move from Portsmouth to Middlesbrough and Amady Faye&apos;s from Portsmouth to Newcastle. Considering that the FA&apos;s compliance department has been under-resourced for so long, yesterday was vindication of its effectiveness. But Scudamore should be applauded for one thing: that the process which ended yesterday has finally transmitted to Premiership clubs a recognition that corporate governance is essential in their \u00a31bn-a-year-plus industry. It should not have taken so much pain to arrive here, though. The adoption of the recommendations in the Burns report a fortnight ago, with its beefed-up compliance department, has further improved the English game&apos;s governance. The hoped-for introduction of new agents&apos; regulations on September 1 would be another step in the right direction. Those new rules stipulate that before overseas-registered agents deal with English clubs they must first agree to submit to the FA&apos;s rigorous regulations. Currently it is Fifa&apos;s lawyers who are responsible for regulating all cross-border transfers. Quest considers that the most significant step in football&apos;s fight against corruption would be for the world governing body, Fifa, to enshrine into its statutes the FA&apos;s proposal for overseas agents to be policed by the country where they work. But that organisation has always been wary of such devolution and the impact instead is drift which has been fatal. Pini Zahavi is the highest-profile agent to be named in yesterday&apos;s report. Yet the chances of him ever being investigated further by Fifa are minimal. He attended the meeting involving Chelsea&apos;s chief executive, Peter Kenyon; their manager, Jose Mourinho; the agent, Jonathan Barnett; and Arsenal&apos;s then left-back, Ashley Cole, that led to all those other individuals being found guilty of an illegal approach. It is more than a year since the FA delivered its dossier on Zahavi&apos;s conduct to Fifa, and the case closed more than six months ago when Barnett declined to appeal. But the Israeli agent has never been charged with anything. The Quest report has, though, and without finding a single bung. But in its primary purpose of ending the innuendo that was so eloquently expressed by Eriksson, it has failed. One agent explained yesterday why. &quot;If I want to give \u00a3100,000 to a manager, it&apos;s easy,&quot; he said. &quot;I get my fee, say \u00a3500,000, and I pay the tax on it. Then it&apos;s down to about \u00a3380,000. I bank that in an offshore account and I give the \u00a3100,000 to the manager in his offshore account and no one would ever know.&quot; The managers Sam Allardyce Inquiry concerned about the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Sam, then Bolton manager, and his son Craig, then a licensed agent under the FA&apos;s jurisdiction Harry Redknapp Willie McKay registered a racehorse in the name of Redknapp, who said its lack of success resulted in no material gain or reward for him.

But they weren&apos;t a couple of valiant explorers who had successfully scaled a previously unconquered peak, and they weren&apos;t inviting the villagers below to share their sense of jubilation. Instead, they were two religious settler youths who&apos;d come back to the abandoned settlement of Homesh and were taunting the townspeople below with the Star of David. Why? In their words, &quot;to show them that we&apos;re back - and that we&apos;re not going anywhere.&quot; &quot;Nothing can stop us&quot;, said Aron, the mouthier of the two, when I asked him what message he wanted the Palestinians below to get from their display. &quot;I want them to see that after 2,000 years, the Jewish people have returned - and yeah, I hope waving the flags did wind them up, so know they know how it feels.&quot; Another day, another brazen display of settler racism - not surprising, given the trip Josh and I have embarked on for the next eight weeks, but this time the scale of the hostility was far larger. We had come up on one of 50 buses chartered to take settlement supporters to Homesh, in the heart of the West Bank, which had been emptied during the disengagement and which the settlers are desperate to reoccupy. Marching under a six-foot high banner proclaiming: &quot;We will not forgive, we will not forget,&quot; the thousands of protesters swarmed around the ruins of the former settlement, planting trees and preparing the ground for their &quot;inevitable&quot; return. The event was organised with the approval of the IDF, which prompted the more extreme branch of the settlement movement to boycott the march, in protest at the collaboration of the settlers with the same army who evicted them two years ago. In spite of the split in the movement, the settlers were out in force on the site where Homesh once stood. Bands played soft rock numbers to the mainly young crowd, people sang and danced in the overgrown fields, politicians gave speeches - and all under the watchful gaze of the army. One soldier we spoke to told us &quot;I understand how the protestors feel - this was their home after all,&quot; as he nonchalantly described what his unit would do if the crowd refused to leave the hilltop at the allotted time. &quot;We&apos;ll try to eject anyone who attempts to camp out here,&quot; he said, &quot;but if they won&apos;t leave, we&apos;ll have to stay up here and guard them until they do.&quot; What he was telling us, in effect, was that the army had no problem taking a half-hearted, laissez-faire approach to protestors challenging the soldiers&apos; authority, and that it was &quot;understandable&quot; that people ejected from their homes should want to come back to the site and lament their loss. Which is all well and good - until you consider the army&apos;s approach to the same kind of protest on the Palestinian side of the divide. Having witnessed, and participated in, the hard-line repression of Palestinian protests during my time in the IDF, the duplicity of the army when dealing with rightwing protestors speaks volumes. It&apos;s not as though the military treat all Israelis with kid gloves, the leftwing get it in the neck, often literally, at protests such as those held weekly at Bil&apos;in. For a supposedly impartial army, the tacit approval of such incendiary marches is nothing short of shameful, especially with the world&apos;s media looking on. It&apos;s not as though the Homesh crowd were just looking for a benign location to vent their frustration and despair. If they were, they could have arranged a gathering at Rabin Square in the heart of Tel Aviv, avoiding yet more heartache for the Palestinians living in the northern Shomron region. But, of course, that wasn&apos;t the aim at all, as the two flag-waving provocateurs on the hilltop perfectly proved. &quot;We have three options for dealing with them,&quot; said Yitz, pointing at the village below with his flagpole, &quot;make them live in peace with us, let them carry on with their terrorism, or kick them all out. All the people down there want us dead - giving places like Homesh back to them isn&apos;t enough, in their eyes.&quot; Sarah, who lives on a nearby settlement and had come to Homesh to make a similar point, gestured expansively to the hills on the horizon and declared &quot;in the long term we&apos;ll be on that hilltop, and that one, and that one and Gaza too. It&apos;ll be a slow process, but it will happen.&quot; She lamented the fact that &quot;round the world people have an image of us as the bad guys, but they [the Palestinians] can build their houses anywhere and not get killed, whereas whenever we settle somewhere we need the army to come and defend us. It&apos;s ironic.&quot; And - regardless of her skewed interpretation of which side is more dangerous to the other - the fact that the army were once again opting to walk hand-in-hand with the settler back into the West Bank is a damning indictment of the political status quo in Israel. For the Palestinian villagers looking up at the spectacle from down in the valley, &quot;We will never forgive, we will never forget&quot; could well become their rejoinder next time they&apos;re asked to take Israel&apos;s overtures of peace seriously. In his report this week, Alvaro de Soto suggested that &quot;If Israel ... was seen to be moving earnestly to end the occupation, I believe it would aid rather than handicap its legitimate fight against terrorism.&quot; Aiding and abetting racist hilltop youth in their quest to do just the opposite is a damning indictment of the Israeli leadership&apos;s commitment to forging peace with their neighbours.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-16T16:00:00Z", "title": "Give peace a chance", "sentences": ["If they were, they could have arranged a gathering at Rabin Square in the heart of Tel Aviv, avoiding yet more heartache for the Palestinians living in the northern Shomron region."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/16/givepeaceachance"}, {"tags": [], "article": "David Newman is Professor of Political Geography in the Department of Politics and Government at Ben Gurion University in Israel. Since 1999, he has been the chief editor of the international journal, Geopolitics, the leading academic journal in this field, published quarterly by Taylor Francis (Routledge).  Newman was born and educated in the UK. His degrees are from the University of London (1978) and Durham (1981). From 1982-1987, he was a lecturer in the Department of Geography at Tel Aviv University, following which he was a senior lecturer in the Department of Geography at Ben Gurion University. In 1998, he founded the Department of Politics and Government, and served as its first chair from 1998-2003. From 1996-1998 he was Director of the Hubert Humphrey Institute for Social Research at Ben Gurion University. In 2003 he facilitated the founding of the Centre for the Study of European Politics and Society (CESPS) at the University.  During the academic year 2006-2007, Newman was the visiting Leverhulme Professor of Geopolitics at the University of Bristol, UK, and is presently a visiting professor at Queen Mary College, University of London. Newman has been appointed as the representative of Israel&apos;s universities in the UK on all matters relating to the academic boycott and bilateral research and scientific collaboration between the two countries.  Professionally, Newman serves as a member of the International Boundaries Research Unit (IBRU) in the UK, the Association of Borderland Studies (ABS) in the USA, the Border Regions in Transition (BRIT) network, and as a member of the Commission on the World Political Map (WPM) of the International Geographical Union (IGU). He has facilitated and attended as keynote speaker many international gatherings dealing with geopolitical and border related issues. Newman has spent periods of time as visiting professor and research fellow at a number of universities and research institutions throughout Europe and North America. Newman has published widely on territorial dimensions of the Israel-Palestine conflict. In particular his work has focused on issues relating to borders and settlements. In addition to his academic writing, Newman has published op-eds on related issues in a variety of newspapers, including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Guardian. Between 1996-2003, he wrote a weekly political column in the Jerusalem Post.  Since the late 1980&apos;s, Newman has been involved in peace-related activities and in a variety of Track II discussions and negotiations. This includes joint Israeli-Palestinian projects looking at territorial and border issues, funded by the Ford Foundations, the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He has recently been appointed editor of the new Middle East Peace and Security book series, to be published from 2005 onwards by Routledge, based on papers presented at Track II discussions during the past decade. He is invited to give regular briefings on border and settlement related issues to the USA State Department, as well as the British and Canadian Foreign Ministries.  Newman is currently directing three research projects directly related to the peace process, two of which are funded through the EU. As part of the Fifth framework projects, Newman is responsible for the Israeli participation in the EUROborder project, examining the role of the EU in affecting conflict resolution in Europe and neighbouring regions. He has also recently received a Partnerhsip in Peace Project to look at the role of religion in influencing the peace discourse in Israel. Newman is also responsible for a USIP project examining potential models of trans-boundary cooperation between Israel and a future Palestinian state.

For a few days, the key players in the Middle East conflict were simply too stunned by last week&apos;s events to react. They could see that the landscape had changed completely - that the Palestinian national movement had split in two, with Hamas seizing Gaza, leaving Fatah in charge of the West Bank, thereby stumbling into a &quot;two-statelet solution&quot; no one ever planned. But what this meant for the historic conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, no one was sure. Now they&apos;ve had time to regroup, the United States, Europe and Israel think they&apos;ve worked out a response. Not only that, they reckon they have seen a flicker of light in the gloom. Part of the perversity of their trade is to see opportunity where lesser mortals might see only crisis, and so it is now. The western strategy, endorsed not only in Jerusalem and Washington but by European foreign ministers at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, is to set up an elaborate demonstration exercise for the Palestinians. They will be offered two alternative Palestines and asked to choose which one best represents their future. On the West Bank shall arise Fatahland, soon to be showered with cash from the very western tap that stayed shut as long as Hamas were in the picture. President Mahmoud Abbas will not only receive money but multiple goodwill gestures from Israel: an easing of roadblocks, cooperation on security, a glimpse of the &quot;political horizon&quot;, meaning the prospect of negotiations aimed at an eventual Palestinian state. If things go well, a high-ranking Israeli government official told me yesterday, Israel could once again return chunks of West Bank territory to Palestinian control, as it did during the Oslo process. In Gaza, meanwhile, would fester the new land of Hamastan, an Islamist-ruled hellhole shunned by the rest of the world, starved of all but the most emergency humanitarian aid. Where Fatahland would feel the warmth of the west&apos;s open arms and deep pockets, Hamastan would know only its cold shoulder. Pretty soon Palestinians would draw the obvious conclusion. As that Israeli government insider puts it, &quot;They&apos;ll understand that moderate policies bring home the bacon, while the other road brings only pain.&quot; You can see the appeal. If all went to plan, either Gazans would eventually rise up and eject Hamas from power, or Hamas itself would realise it had to change course. After all, if the Palestinians of the West Bank were marching towards prosperity and statehood, Gazans would not want to be left behind. The upheaval of last week could surely bring another happy benefit. For years Israel and the US have urged the Palestinian Authority to uproot the &quot;infrastructure of terror&quot; and crack down on Hamas - without much success. Now though, runs the thinking, Fatah are amply motivated to do the job. After they watched Hamas militants execute Fatah fighters in the street, loot Yasser Arafat&apos;s home and hurl Abbas&apos;s personal cook from the 18th floor of a building to his death, Fatah are only too eager to flush out Hamas from the West Bank. It sounds logical enough. Nurture a flowering Fatahland while pariah Hamastan withers away. But it is surely a delusion. The first and most obvious danger is that the more generous the west is to Abbas, the more his credibility will be destroyed. Every dollar or euro he takes will confirm him as the lackey of foreign powers, casting him alongside Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Nuri al-Maliki of Iraq and Fuad Siniora of Lebanon as a mere western proxy. Each bouquet from Israel will tarnish him further, establishing him as the servant of the enemy. Already the Arab press is comparing Abbas with Antoine Lahad, the strongman whose hated South Lebanon Army served as Israel&apos;s policeman. As has happened so often before, in seeking to boost &quot;moderates,&quot; the west only hugs them to death. Besides, the whole idea rests on a series of faulty assumptions. First, it assumes that Israel will indeed come through with the goodies it promises. On this, the record is not encouraging. Ehud Olmert has repeatedly met Abbas and promised the release of tax funds or greater freedom of movement, only to do nothing. Second, even if Israel does hand over the cash, there is no guarantee that Abbas&apos;s Fatah-dominated administration could translate that into improvements on the ground. Again, past experience is not encouraging. Put crudely, Fatah has shown itself to be either corrupt or incompetent or both. But let&apos;s be optimistic and imagine the new approach did indeed bear fruit on the West Bank. Do we imagine that Hamas would calmly sit by, watching itself being pushed out of the Palestinian future? Veteran Palestinian analyst and negotiator Ahmad Khalidi asks, &quot;What incentive is there for Hamas to play along and not spoil it?&quot; We all know how easy it would be to wreck any rapprochement between Fatahland and Israel: a simple terror attack on Israeli civilians and it would all be over. Hamas could be clever about it and ensure the attack came not from Gaza but from the West Bank, say in the Hamas stronghold of Nablus. That would undermine Abbas instantly. The dangers are multiple. If the West Bank is lavished with money but much of it stays in Fatah&apos;s gilded circle, thereby creating a class of haves and have-nots, there would be a surge of precisely the resentment that led to Hamas&apos;s election victory in January 2006. Who knows, Hamas could even end up taking over the West Bank too - after all, they had the edge over Fatah in elections there. Precedent makes clear that shunning the movement only makes it stronger. Ostracised for the last 18 months, they are more powerful than ever. Yet this is the current strategy, not just of the Israelis and the Bush administration - who both reiterated it at yesterday&apos;s White House summit - but everyone involved. I know it&apos;s always more comfortable to cast those two actors as the prime villains in this drama. On last week&apos;s Any Questions, the panellists confidently condemned the 18 month-long American and Israeli embargo of Hamas. But that embargo originated in a set of UN demands that Hamas refused to meet, was backed by the EU and firmly endorsed by Britain. This, in other words, is our policy too. But it is badly mistaken. The sounder approach is surely to recognise that Hamas is now a fact of life in Palestine, just as political Islam is a fact of life in the Middle East. We may wish it were not so - I certainly do - but we cannot wish it away. Hamas enjoys a democratic mandate; it now rules a territory that threatens to be a Taliban-style state on Israel&apos;s doorstep. It simply makes no sense to pretend that it does not exist. The choice now, says Tel Aviv University analyst Gary Sussman, is either &quot;to isolate Hamas, pushing it further into the Iranian orbit, or to engage it, luring it into the western and Sunni orbit&quot;. This has to be the more pragmatic course. The story of the last few decades has been a constant effort to wish the Palestinians were represented by people other than those who actually led them. Each of those attempts has ended in failure. It&apos;s time to recognise reality and to follow the oldest advice in the diplomats&apos; handbook: you don&apos;t make peace with your friends - you make peace with your enemies. freedland@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2007-06-19T23:09:23Z", "title": "Jonathan Freedland: The scene of Fatahland flowering  as Hamastan wilts is sheer fantasy", "sentences": ["The choice now, says Tel Aviv University analyst Gary Sussman, is either &quot;to isolate Hamas, pushing it further into the Iranian orbit, or to engage it, luring it into the western and Sunni orbit&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/20/israel.comment"}, {"tags": ["Religion", "US news", "Crime", "Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "The man on my right looked thoroughly bored. He had been cornered by a small, yapping man of 50, who was offloading half-baked conspiracy theories like an over-excited child, apparently driving his audience to distraction. The man on my right wore a blank, glazed expression and stared around the synagogue disinterestedly, as Yappy warmed to his theme, &quot;I mean - the BBC actually apologised for calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel! Apologised! Can you believe it?&quot; My right hand man barely blinked as he continued, &quot;But seriously, like it won&apos;t belong till the UN vote Israel out. Yeah. Within 5 years, some Arab state will propose it, the UN will vote and bang! They&apos;ll dissolve Israel. Good bye.&quot; This was the fourth time in as many hours that I had heard the yapman cram his three pet hates into one anecdote, and I was delighted finally to see another man as bored with his nonsense as I was. Or so I thought. But then the man to my right looked up at the yapper and fixed his gaze. He paused, heavy with solemnity, before finally speaking: &quot;You ready for the war?&quot; He asked. &quot; ... It&apos;s gonna be big.&quot; Fantastic. I was in a room full of idiots. But, unfortunately, these were idiots with guns. As the circle sang and danced round the bimah, celebrating the start of Shabbat; white shirts, white table cloths, white muslin decorating the shul walls and tiny children clinging to their fathers legs; as the congregation clapped and smiled and one of the babies spilt out over his father&apos;s arm, my eyes were drawn to the man&apos;s waist, where I noticed a large black pistol tucked into his trousers. The circle danced on and I looked to the waist of another man: another gun, nuzzled close to the trailing white tzitzit. And like the moment in vampire films when the hero notices that all the people in the room have sharp teeth, that was the moment when I realised just where I was. Not all of the people that I met in this small, remote settlement were stupid and only some carried guns, but within the small American minority amongst whom we were staying, the mixture of guns and ignorance emitted an ominous odour. This was so far from anything Seth and I had experienced thus far on our trip and was a million miles away from my experiences of left-leaning, liberal Tel Aviv. That here, on this desert mountain, only 20 minutes from Jerusalem, there lived such an isolated group that had such an incredible monopoly over the truth was deeply discomforting. The dominant ideology of this small group of American immigrants - who pray and study in a separate synagogue from the bulk of the settlement - is based on the teachings of Meir Kahane, who formed the now outlawed Kach party. Kahane preached a radical solution to dealing with the conflict between Jews and Arabs and this has had a profound effect on the residents of the settlement. In our Talmud session on Saturday afternoon, held over a bottle of non-specific alcohol - 95% - the teacher talked about how the new temple will not arise in times of peace, but rather through war and bloodshed. &quot;Those Liberals think it&apos;s all about peace. Yeah right - like there wasn&apos;t blood in the last temple. Like David didn&apos;t kill thousands of people. Was he wrong? Hell no. He killed evil people, he was a righteous man.&quot; The teacher went on to say that the fact that we don&apos;t know where the holiest spot on Temple Mount is shouldn&apos;t stop the Jews from going to look for it in order to rebuild the temple. The al-Aqsa Mosque now stands on Temple Mount and most rabbis forbid Jews from going there. With the now familiar picture of the rebuilt temple hanging on the wall of the synagogue (which is itself held inside a bomb shelter), talk of bloodshed in order to bring that image to fruition was quite alarming. However, the presence of those such as the Yapper mean that the chances of this irregular band of merry men ever organising to bring about such a coup is unlikely. Nevertheless, the fact that a small group of Americans can be so remote and isolated from Israel&apos;s political reality as to hide behind the warmongering rhetoric of an outlawed racist political movement is a shameful reality for a generally well-educated and politically informed country. Our host was a warm and friendly woman who genuinely believed the narrative that the peaceful Jews want to live in peace, but the hate-filled Arabs just won&apos;t stop killing them. The answer, she said, was education. Without education, the Arabs would remain fundamentalists, full of violent hate. Sadly, she seemed oblivious to the irony of her words. And as she resorted to the safety of her &quot;only&quot; two solutions to the Israel-Palestine problem - that of ethnic cleansing of Arabs or of a world in which everyone believed in the Jewish God. Fundamentalism, hatred and a lack of education were shown to be just as dangerous on the Jewish side of the conflict as they are on the Palestinian.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-21T07:00:00Z", "title": "Pistols and politics", "sentences": ["This was so far from anything Seth and I had experienced thus far on our trip and was a million miles away from my experiences of left-leaning, liberal Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/21/pistolsandpolitics"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "LGBT rights", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Police in Jerusalem were preparing for violent protests from hardline religious groups today during a planned Gay Pride march through the streets of the city centre. Police have faced violent skirmishes in ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods of the city since approving the march a week ago. More than 100 people have been arrested, according to police. Yesterday, Israel&apos;s supreme court gave formal approval for the event, dismissing an appeal by rightwing groups. Up to 5,000 marchers were expected to take part in this evening&apos;s parade, which will travel just 500 metres from the city&apos;s King David hotel to a park, where a gathering will be held. They will be guarded by more than 7,000 police. Jerusalem&apos;s Gay Pride march is a relatively low-key affair, even by comparison with its annual equivalent in Tel Aviv, with none of the flamboyance and costumes associated with such events in Europe and the US. Every year, the march prompts an angry reaction from Jews, Christians and Muslims and has increasingly become a point of division for conservative, religious opinion and more secular, leftwing citizens. At the 2005 march, an ultra-Orthodox man stabbed and wounded three marchers. Last year, fears of violence led the march to be moved from the city centre to a sports stadium in a more distant suburb. Prison authorities in the city have already cleared 200 cells to make room for the expected arrests, the Jerusalem Post newspaper said today, with some police standing guard on the route of the march as early as 6am. Overnight, police used water cannon to disperse stone-throwing protestors in one ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood, arresting 15 people, the newspaper reported. A recent opinion poll said that two-thirds of the city&apos;s residents opposed the Gay Pride march. Many religious locals say it is inappropriate for a place considered so holy. But civil liberties groups argue the event must be accepted in a tolerant society. &quot;The question of &apos;why in Jerusalem?&apos; is not a question. It is the same question as letting women vote,&quot; said Dana Olmert, a gay rights activist and the daughter of Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert. &quot;The gay parade is a political event and it is an expression of a political stance. Political activity is something you do, and we do it without needing to ask permission,&quot; she told Israel&apos;s army radio. Gay rights marches have increasingly become a test of tolerance in countries where homosexuality is officially permitted but widely discriminated against. Last month, the British campaigner Peter Tatchell and the Right Said Fred singer Richard Fairbrass were among gay rights demonstrators beaten and arrested by riot police in Moscow. &quot;It was absolutely shocking,&quot; Mr Tatchell told the Guardian after the event. &quot;The police stood there while people knocked me to the ground and kicked me. Four or five neo-Nazis attacked me. The police watched.

The magazine carried the article, The Women of the Israel Defence Force, in its July issue after encouragement from the Israeli consulate in New York as part of its broader campaign to improve Israel&apos;s image abroad. Most Israeli women do compulsory military service for two years from the age of 18. While they do not fight in combat units, they undergo basic training and can be seen at checkpoints in the West Bank. In the magazine, one of the women, Yarden, describes how she enjoyed firing her M16 rifle before she entered the military intelligence corps, while Nivit says her job in intelligence was so secret that she cannot talk about it. There is nothing military about the photographs, however, which are taken in different locations in Tel Aviv Zahava Gal On, the leader of the Meretz party, said it was inappropriate for western countries to market themselves using half-naked women. &quot;It is unfortunate that the New York consulate thinks that Israel&apos;s relevance will be expressed by the use of naked women who are treated as an object, and not as women of substance who exude achievement and success,&quot; she said. Colette Avital, of the Labour party, described the article as a &quot;pornographic campaign to encourage tourism&quot;. In a statement the magazine said: &quot;Maxim was approached by the Israeli consulate to be a part of reshaping Israel&apos;s public image, specifically because of our unmatched mainstream reach to men aged 18 to 35. We are pleased with the result of our work together.&quot; It is not the first time that Israel has used sex to sell itself. The Israeli ministry of tourism has an advertising contract with Arsenal FC to promote Israel which features women in swimsuits. Israel is keen to sell itself as a western country with beaches and nightclubs rather than a country full of religious zealots which has been in a permanent state of emergency since its creation. The Israeli government also has a MySpace page to promote its image and tourism. Staff at the consulate said that they decided a photoshoot would be a good way of promoting Israel to young Americans. David Dorfman, an adviser at the consulate in New York, told the Associated Press: &quot;Males that age have no feeling towards Israel one way or another, and we view that as a problem, so we came up with an idea that would be appealing to them.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-21T22:58:54Z", "title": "Women soldiers in their underwear: Israel's image boost", "sentences": ["There is nothing military about the photographs, however, which are taken in different locations in Tel Aviv Zahava Gal On, the leader of the Meretz party, said it was inappropriate for western countries to market themselves using half-naked women."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/21/israel1"}, {"tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Afghanistan", "World news", "Foreign policy"], "article": "Sherard Cowper-Coles was expecting a big job in London as he approached the end of his tour of duty in Saudi Arabia, but found that he was being posted to Kabul to oversee Britain&apos;s ambitious and controversial mission to bring stability to Afghanistan. No-one who knows Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador can have seriously expected him to stay silent. His warning this week that the UK presence was a marathon that could last three decades, not a short sprint, has confirmed his reputation for shrewd and undiplomatic plain speaking - with a dash of self-advertisement. Sir Sherard, 52, has been making waves since he joined the Foreign Office in 1977 with an Oxford double first in classics. He studied Arabic at the &quot;school for spies&quot; at Shemlan in Lebanon, using what his friend and ex-ambassador Chris Wilton calls &quot;a brain the size of a small planet&quot;, before being sent to Cairo. &quot;Sherard is more than just a diplomat,&quot; says Rosemary Hollis of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. &quot;He&apos;s a man with a voice and views. Mealy-mouthed he is not.&quot; Another former colleague observes: &quot;Sherard is talented, clever and successful, so he does attract acid comment.&quot; Flurries of attention and controversy have accompanied Cowper-Coles in every job he has done. An indiscreet briefing on Northern Ireland when he was at the Washington embassy had unionists baying for his blood. In the early 1990s he clashed with Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, over moves to democratise the colony before the handover to China. He came close to the heart of power as Robin Cook&apos;s private secretary during the Kosovo crisis, helping his prickly and gaffe-prone boss manage a difficult relationship with the mandarins. It was a sign of change that he became the first Arabist to be posted as ambassador to Tel Aviv in 2001 as the second Palestinian intifada raged in the West Bank and Gaza. &quot;Tony Blair wanted to win the trust of the Israelis and Sherard played a big role in that,&quot; recalls the Middle East journalist Adel Darwish. Characteristically, he made much of studying Hebrew in north London and then wowing the natives. But schmoozing and swapping farming anecdotes with then prime minister Ariel Sharon did nothing to stop the grim deterioration of the conflict. Next stop, with some raised eyebrows in the Arab world, was Saudi Arabia, a strategic linchpin of British policy in the region, where oil and other delicate matters such as the massive al-Yamamah arms deal had to be carefully managed. It was there, last year, that Cowper-Coles famously recommended that the Serious Fraud Office end its criminal investigation into alleged bribery by the British arms firm BAE or see grave damage to British interests - a position he still insists was justified. The Saudis liked the tough way the man they called &quot;Abu Henry&quot; (after his oldest son) responded to al-Qaida terrorist attacks. But he was forced to make a Boris Johnson style apology to the people of Nottingham when he claimed that the streets of Saudi cities were safer than theirs. Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister, paid glowing public tribute when the Cowper-Coleses left (his wife Bridget is also an accomplished Arabist.) The sentiment was genuine, Saudis say. Sadly, the ambassador&apos;s pet falcons, Nour and Alwaleed, had to stay behind due to UK veterinary regulations. Previous British envoys to Saudi Arabia have gone on to plum European capitals - compensation after the rigours of the austere Wahabi system - or a top position in Whitehall. Cowper-Coles might have expected to become a director at the Foreign Office or follow another big hitter, Nigel Sheinwald, as the prime minister&apos;s foreign policy adviser. But Sheinwald, heading for Washington, is being replaced by another Arabist and Iraq expert. Cowper-Coles was braced for another call about BAE when his secure phone in the Riyadh embassy rang late last year. But it was the news that he was being asked to go Afghanistan. He was surprised, but said yes at once. Kabul used to be a lowly grade-three posting and would have been seen as a step down after Riyadh. But that is old thinking. In the aftermath of what every Foreign Office Arabist sees as the disaster of the war in Iraq Afghanistan has become a far higher priority: the overall effort being made now is far beyond the scale of any other British diplomatic mission in the world, combining political support for the Karzai government with development aid, judicial training and other advice, to say nothing of being on the front line of an escalating war with the Taliban. &quot;Sherard is a big, ballsy character who&apos;s always believed he should be shaping policy rather than just implementing it,&quot; says another old friend and admirer. Now he is getting his biggest ever chance to do that in what is without doubt the toughest job he has ever been asked to do.

Being a moderate is even more unfashionable these days, probably because moderation can be a thinly disguised cover for lack of sustained principles and vacuousness. I am a moderate when it comes to Israel but not, I hope, vacuous. It is an uncomfortable position with traffic coming at me from both sides. I am a Zionist and define Zionism as a non-negotiable commitment to the right of the state of Israel to exist and an equal commitment to the pursuit of peace as the highest value, to democracy and human rights. That exposes me to the rage of Israel&apos;s critics on the one side and to the Jewish &quot;realists&quot; and cynics on the other. But I don&apos;t really matter in this regard. Consider the position of a group called OneVoice. OneVoice is an Israeli-Palestinian joint initiative. It seeks to give voice to the moderate majority on both sides and articulate their desire for peace based upon compromise. OneVoice planned mass, simultaneous rallies in Gaza and Tel Aviv with thousands upon thousands of people already signed up. Today, the OneVoice Gaza office is in a state of fear and confusion. The situation in Gaza is terrible. Friends offered to evacuate the OneVoice staff. To which they responded: &quot;To all of you, we love Gaza, and whatever we do, we do because we love it and we can&apos;t leave it whatever the situation is. Thank you for your kind offer to ensure a passage for our safety. You should be proud because you have such a team in Gaza. OneVoice will remain and work strongly in Gaza because such an organisation and other civil society organisations are the last and the only hope for a better future.&quot; These are the principled moderates we need to support. Last week I met an Israeli Arab, Mohammad Darawshe. Darawshe works for The Abraham Fund Initiatives which seeks to improve the conditions and raise the de facto status of Israel&apos;s Arab population, move Israel in the direction of being a Jewish state and a state for all its citizens and demonstrate that Jews and Palestinians can live side by side in cooperation and amity. The Abraham Fund is becoming an umbrella for dozens of reconciliation initiatives. Darawshe believes that their work is a lesson for all and not just for those who agree with them. These are also the non-vacuous moderates that we must support. Christian Aid is an organisation which has made a habit of upsetting the mainstream of the Jewish community in Britain. All too often it portrays the Palestinians as the poor and the oppressed and Israel as the wealthy and powerful oppressor. It fails to acknowledge the reality of the Islamist threat and the ruthless determination of Islamist leadership. That imbalance was present in a recent paper advocating what it called &quot;viability&quot;. Yet Christian Aid was absolutely right in pointing to the poverty and deprivation of the Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, and indicating that no solution to the situation in the Middle East is possible whilst such conditions of wretchedness are allowed to persist. Which is why, for once, I disagree with another &quot;moderate&quot; and veteran peace activist Gershon Baskin of the Israel Palestine Centre for Research and Information. Writing in the Jerusalem Post, Dr Baskin says: &quot;Gaza is lost, for the time being. The Palestinians of Gaza, both the supporters of Hamas and their opposition have to live with this new reality. Gaza will be detached from the world.&quot; Peace is untenable for as long as conditions in Gaza endure which the exponents of terrorism can exploit. A humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza cannot be permitted by Israel, Egypt and the west - morally or as a matter of realpolitik. The moderate majority cannot be, must not be abandoned. Jonathan Freedland, writing in The Guardian last week, rightly sounded the alarm at what he perceived to be an American and European plan to take advantage of the present situation and push Israel in the direction of making concessions to President Abbas and establishing a &quot;good Palestinian state&apos;&quot;model on the West Bank in contrast to the isolated and untouchable &quot;bad Palestinian state&quot; model in Gaza. But he went on to suggest that we should not get too cosy with the moderates. It depends on who he means are the moderates. To me the moderates are those who want to see Israel living at peace with a viable and prosperous Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza. And if that includes President Abbas then so be it. We have to support all those who believe in two states, a Palestinian State in which Jews can live safely and an Israel in which the Palestinian minority will model how minorities can live freely within a majority culture without seeking to overthrow it. Unrealistic? It&apos;s less unrealistic than thinking that Islamism can be defeated by allowing Gaza to become even more of a hell than it is now. It is also less unrealistic than ignoring or downplaying the Islamist threat which, whatever its origins, is a mortal threat to Israel - and not just to Israel. Which brings me to my moderate, middle-of-the-road position. We abandon the moderates at our peril. We simply cannot ignore the embattled members of the OneVoice office in Gaza. We must listen seriously to Mohammad Darawshe and the many organisations in Israel for which his is an umbrella. We must heed Christian Aid and their recognition that poverty and deprivation cannot be tolerated. But equally we simply cannot ignore the traffic on the other side of the road, the Hamas supporters, the Islamists, those who seriously threaten many of the values we hold dear. To think we can isolate them, lock them up with their hostages in Gaza and throw away the key is unacceptable both morally and practically. One cannot just deal with, talk with one stream of traffic. One has to deal with both. Even Hamas in Gaza. That&apos;s the true middle-of-the-road position and, however dangerous it is, it&apos;s better than standing on the pavement watching the traffic on both sides hurtle to oblivion.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-26T07:00:00Z", "title": "Driving in the middle", "sentences": ["OneVoice planned mass, simultaneous rallies in Gaza and Tel Aviv with thousands upon thousands of people already signed up."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/26/drivinginthemiddle"}, {"tags": ["Tony Blair", "World news"], "article": "When you hear the news of Tony Blair&apos;s possible appointment as the Quartet&apos;s peace envoy to the Middle East, you don&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry. His selection for the job takes American policy in the Middle East to new heights of absurdity. The proposal we all know was put forward and pushed neither by Russia, nor the EU, but by the US as a reward for years of good service. But the decision is lunacy itself. The guiding question could only have been: who is the most profoundly resented and bitterly hated man in the Middle East? Bar Bush, the honour could only have gone to Blair. Blair is said to have offered himself forward for the job in one of his private conversations with Bush, who then proceeded to arm wrestle the Quartet to agree the appointment. But he has no idea of how deeply loathed he is in the region to which he wishes to be dispatched as peace envoy. When Arabs speak of Bush they refer to Blair as his &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;mouthpiece&quot;. The difference between the two in their eyes is between the master and his loyal servant. One lays down the policies, the other markets them. Once more Blair&apos;s boundless arrogance blinds him to what appears as clear as daylight to others. In the Middle East, his name is associated with catastrophe, with the inferno he has helped create in Iraq. For that is exactly what Iraq is today, whatever Blair may think, shrouded in a cocoon of hubris as he is. A recently issued Global Policy Forum report (June 2007) paints a hellish picture of violence, destruction of civil authority and cultural heritage, anarchy, insecurity, and poverty. It documents how hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died (500,000), more than 4 million have been displaced, including over 2 million (2.2 million) that have fled the country. Whole cities lie in ruins. In addition to Fallujah which was heavily assaulted in April and November 2004, these include Tal Afar (September 2004, September 2005), Samarraa (October 2004, September 2005, March 2006), al-Qaim (May and November 2005), Haditha (October 2005), Ramadi (October 2005, June 2006) and Baquba (January 2007). &quot;In Fallujah, a city of 300,000,&quot; the report says, &quot;over 216,000 displaced persons had to seek shelter in overcrowded camps in the cold winter months inadequately supplied with food, water and medical care. An estimated 100,000 fled in al-Qaim, a city of 150,000 ... In Ramadi an estimated 70% of the city&apos;s 400,000 left in advance of the US onslaught. These moments mark the beginning of Iraq&apos;s massive displacement crisis.&quot; Aside from Iraq, it is for Lebanon that the people of the Middle East remember Blair. For when the whole world stood united in demanding a ceasefire, horrified at Israel&apos;s brutal bombardment of the country that left more than 1,000 people dead and 700,000-915,000 homeless, Blair chose to stand with Bush and Olmert. Defying the international community, not to mention his own cabinet, backbenchers, party and public opinion, Blair insisted on giving Israel all the necessary political cover and whatever time it needed to &quot;finish the job&quot;. There is an Arab proverb that goes &quot;He utters a lie then believes it&quot;. One wonders if that is the case with Blair, if he really does think that he can act as honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians and bring peace to the Middle East. But whatever goes inside the mind of our soon-to-be ex-prime minister changes nothing about the facts. For the truth is that when it comes to the Arab/Israeli conflict Blair is fit neither for the part of intermediary, nor for that of envoy. Since moving into 10 Downing Street he has been a cheerleader for Israel&apos;s policies, its repeated incursions, invasions, assassinations, land seizure, settlement, and building of the illegal separation wall on the scraps of land left, upon which the illusory &quot;Palestinian state&quot; he purports to champion is to be built. What he should do is join the delegations from Tel Aviv or Washington and sit at a table bearing the Israeli or American flags. He is neither &quot;honest&quot;, nor a &quot;broker&quot; but part of the crises raging in the region, in Iraq, Palestine, or Lebanon. To appoint him as peace envoy to the region is to twist the knife in a still bleeding wound, adding insult to injury. If Blair is really convinced that he is well placed to do the job, he should perform the following test: take a walk, not in the streets of Baghdad, which he has helped destroy, but of Beirut, Damascus, Cairo, or any of the capitals of the region to which he wishes to be envoy - except Tel Aviv, of course. If he comes back in one piece, then he has my blessings. But if Lionel Jospin was pelted with stones by Palestinians during his visit to Beir Zeit University in the West Bank -in spite of France&apos;s relatively balanced positions in the Middle East - Blair should count himself lucky if he gets off so lightly. It seems that Blair is set to remain a curse on Britain&apos;s interests in the region, whether in 10 Downing St, or outside it. What was left for Britain after the fragmentation of its imperial power in the Middle East following the Suez Crisis of 1956 was a measure of soft power: some cultural, diplomatic, and economic influence. Much of this was damaged with the invasion of Iraq, after which protesters across the region began to burn the British flag alongside the American and a tiny effigy for Blair with Bush&apos;s larger one. His appointment as Middle East envoy risks wiping out whatever is left of Britain&apos;s standing in the Arab world. Having failed to be appointed head of the World Bank, and rejected by most Europeans as president of the EU, and by Arabs as Middle East envoy, what is Blair to do? In my view, Blair should return to the stage and have a go at chasing his long dream of being an actor. For that is what he has always been. As PM he blurred the boundaries between politics and acting. With him politics became one with image, sound bite, make-up, hair dye, designer suits, carefully rehearsed movements and fake smiles.

For 16 graduates of City University, a much harsher reality is sinking in. After three years together in London, they must return to their communities on opposing sides of the Middle East conflict, and get used to the fact that they will probably never meet as a group again. Britain&apos;s attentions may be fixed on Big Brother, but these eight Israeli and eight Palestinian students have just completed an altogether more challenging experiment in communal living run by their university, called the Olive Tree project. Education Guardian initially met them in September 2004, when they became the first group from across the Middle East divide to live together, study for their degrees together over three years, and undertake a parallel programme to learn about one another&apos;s cultures and to talk about how to bring peace to their region. So near, yet so far Gilad Halpern, a 25-year-old Israeli from Tel Aviv, became best of friends with Khaled Jamoos, a 22-year-old Palestinian from Nablus. &quot;We live about 80km away from each other but we&apos;re very sceptical about the prospects of seeing each other now,&quot; Halpern says. &quot;Before we said goodbye - and it was goodbye - we were trying to think how we can circumvent the system, since by law, I cannot visit him in his home town and he is virtually unable to enter metropolitan Israel. In order to do that, he has to knowingly subject himself to the capricious, arbitrary and hard-hearted bureaucracy of the Israeli &apos;civil administration&apos;. &quot;Can we meet at Hawara checkpoint, in the outskirts of Nablus? If so, where can we sit? We can&apos;t go to his house, obviously, and if we sit and chat in the car everybody around us will think he&apos;s a collaborator. The sad thing about it all is that some of us managed to go the extra mile and form friendships across the divide, but will we be able to maintain them? At what cost?&quot; Dr Colin Shindler, reader in Israeli and modern Jewish studies at Soas, is a trustee of the Olive Tree. &quot;Educationally, this project is extremely valuable and was a great success,&quot; he says. &quot;Hopefully, at some point all the madness in the Middle East will die away and these young people, with the lessons they learned, will be able to stretch across the border, shake hands and shape the future of the region.&quot; Shindler helps to run the parallel cultural and political programme, for which he says the impetus came from the students themselves. This part of the project included visits to religious sites of various faiths, and talks by academics such as Judge Eugene Cotran, an expert in Islamic and Middle Eastern law and conflict resolution, and chairman of the Soas centre of Islamic and Middle Eastern law. They also studied the history of religion and discussed the conflict with guest speakers from Israeli and Palestinian universities. &quot;It really gave the students the ability to look carefully at the issues surrounding their cultures and the conflict,&quot; says Shindler. Despite the tearful goodbyes when the students parted to return home earlier this month, their time together was by no means plain sailing. They faced all the normal pressures of communal living such as squabbles over taking the rubbish out, as well as raging rows over the situation back home, plus of course the pressure of completing a degree in a second language, English. Yael Litminovitz, a 26-year-old Israeli from Kfar Saba, was one of two women involved. She says that Middle Eastern men have a passion for earnest conversation and &quot;honour talk&quot;. A stronger female presence could have put the human side of things at the centre, she says. Causing offence The group was intensely political - conversation even broke down altogether on two occasions. The first was when Litminovitz offended much of the group with comments about the project on her blog. &quot;Lots of the Palestinians were not talking to me. I had touched a delicate issue,&quot; she says, adding: &quot;I felt completely horrible about myself for stretches. I considered leaving several times.&quot; The second, and more far-reaching occasion was following the Lebanon war last summer. In the preceding two years, relations had become amiable, and the group departed London for the holidays abuzz with ideas of follow-up work they could do upon graduation. But when they returned, &quot;everyone was tense&quot;, recalls Omar Quqas, a 24-year-old Palestinian from the Old City of Jerusalem. &quot;The difficulty was that people didn&apos;t want to sit with each other - people only wanted to talk to each other by email.&quot; It took a 90-minute conflict-resolution session to calm things down. &quot;We learned that whenever we have a political discussion related to the conflict, as two sides, we never reach a common opinion,&quot; says 23-year-old Palestinian Mahmoud al-Ashi from Gaza. He adds that they eventually learned to treat each other well on a personal level even in the throes of dispute. Ashi says that the process of learning lessons like these was key to the project. He enrolled so that, in a sense, he could study for two degrees at once - the first was a formal one in communications and engineering, the second was an informal one in Israeli culture that took place during the washing up and similar household tasks. &quot;As an educated person in the Palestinian community I have always believed that to find a peaceful solution to the conflict it is very important for any Palestinian to know everything about people from the other side - how they think, what they eat, what the sense of community is like.&quot; He views this as the only way of challenging the Palestinian reality today that &quot;the Israeli community is just conceived as an enemy&quot;. While Ashi says that the analytical approach of the parallel programme helped the cultural exchange, he adds that the constant flow of news from the Middle East meant that emotion often trumped analysis. &quot;If something happens in the Palestinian community, for example the killing of a Palestinian civilian by Israeli forces, when a Palestinian in London hears, it affects him in his heart. It is natural that it will affect his relations with people from the other side. We had so many arguments about what happens back home.&quot; Some staples of student life survived the divide. They stayed up late smoking together in the kitchen - hookah or shisha instead of cigarettes, in a concession to Arabic culture. There were occasions when the contrasting student cultures of the two sides left room for misunderstanding. When Shahaf Ifhar, a 24-year-old Israeli from Herzliya, told Quqas he had a boyfriend, he was informing him of his sexuality. Recalls Quqas, who grew up in a traditional Muslim family: &quot;I said so do I, presuming he meant that he had friends who are male. He explained he was gay, and it was the first time I had ever met a gay person. It was really shocking to hear - I thought he would be a threat in the flat. He was not, and we got along.&quot; The bond of cooking At other times, the fact that the students had very different upbringings brought them closer. Ashi confesses to that problem still common to many male students - he could not cook. The fact that his Israeli flatmate Eran Zucker had worked as a chef instantly brought them together, in the kitchen if not in politics. The Olive Tree scholars now plan to launch a cross-communal arts project, to allow other youngsters from the two sides to establish some type of cultural contact. However, they acknowledge that the odds are against them. &quot;We leave with excitement but also anxiety,&quot; says Dimi Reider, a 24-year-old Israeli from Bat Yam. &quot;The situation at home is much worse than when we came. I hope we can keep in touch and somehow keep together, as in a very circumvent way I think we can affect things even below the grassroots level. But nothing is certain.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-26T22:42:27Z", "title": "Big Brother meets the Middle East", "sentences": ["So near, yet so far Gilad Halpern, a 25-year-old Israeli from Tel Aviv, became best of friends with Khaled Jamoos, a 22-year-old Palestinian from Nablus."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/26/highereducation.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["UK news", "Politics", "Tony Blair", "World news", "Labour", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "Tony Blair today was appointed special envoy for the Middle East, slipping into a high-profile job just hours after he stepped down as prime minister.

He thinks, and I believe he&apos;s right, that if you have hands-on, persistent engagement that you can make real progress.&quot; Confirmation that the outgoing prime minister was set to throw himself into helping to resolve the Middle East crisis came as it emerged that Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palestinians, most of them gunmen, in their biggest raid on Gaza since Hamas Islamists took over the territory two weeks ago. The latest death toll by Israeli forces was the highest in a single day since Hamas routed the forces of President Mahmoud Abbas&apos; Fatah movement. Three gunmen were killed today near the southern town of Khan Younis. Four militants, three civilians - including a 12-year-old boy - and an unidentified man died in fighting in Gaza City, medical workers and residents said. More than 45 people were wounded. A Fatah spokesman, Jamal Nazzal, condemned the raid, accusing Israel of using Hamas&apos;s takeover of Gaza to try to justify &quot;aggression against Palestinian civilians&quot;. A military spokeswoman in Tel Aviv said that the army was &quot;operating against terror threats&quot; and two soldiers were wounded by an anti-tank missile fired at an armoured vehicle. She said troops shot two armed men during fighting in the Khan Younis area and a tank fired a shell at a gunman in Gaza City&apos;s Shejaia neighbourhood. The operations indicated that Israel intends to keep up the military pressure on Hamas along with its efforts to isolate the militant group financially and politically. Earlier today, Mr Blair was asked about the Middle East crisis during his final appearance at the Commons despatch box. He told MPs: &quot;The only way to bring peace and stability to the Middle East is by a two-state solution.

The deal, announced by the attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, in Jerusalem, brought swift condemnation from MPs and women&apos;s rights campaigners. It marked an extraordinary reversal for Mr Mazuz, who earlier in the year announced that he had sufficient evidence to bring charges against the president of rape, abuse of power and several other sexual offences.

The photograph occupied a prominent position in the delicatessen until it closed earlier this year after Rocco&apos;s death. On the corner of the street where I live is St Joan of Arc&apos;s primary school, and next to it is St Joan of Arc&apos;s church. Together they form a thriving centre of Islington Catholicism. The school is said to be good and over-subscribed, the church (&quot;one of Islington&apos;s best postwar churches&quot; - Pevsner) seems well-attended and the frequent venue of baptisms, weddings and funerals. When Tony and Cherie Blair lived here, they sent their children to the school and took communi on at the church, which in the non-Catholic husband&apos;s case was offensive to Cardinal Hume. He chided Blair, who replied to wonder &quot;what Jesus would have made of it&quot;, implying that as a Christian, albeit an Anglican, he found it odd to be denied the wafer and the wine offered to his Catholic wife and children. That was 10 years ago. Many priests have crossed the Blair threshold since to offer private masses, advice and instruction and out of office, Blair is widely predicted to be on the brink of announcing his conversion - though he will only say opaquely that &quot;things aren&apos;t as resolved as they might be.&quot; Given that Blair is now free of the political and electoral consequences of conversion - one prime ministerial duty concerns the appointment of Anglican bishops - it&apos;s hard to see what the difficulties could be. He became a Christian at Oxford and was confirmed as an Anglican more than 30 years ago. The church has a handy four-step programme for would-be converts called the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, which most people get through between autumn and Easter. As Blair isn&apos;t a catechumenate (unbaptised) but a candidate (already baptised in whatever church), he could get a result even faster, speeding through the Period of Inquiry (examining one&apos;s personal relationship to God), the Period of Catechumenate (in his case as a candidate, the Rite of Welcoming), the Period of Purification and Enlightenment (to receive the Sacraments of Initiation), then have a long break in Tel Aviv and Beirut and still be in time to reach the Period of Mystagogia (ancient Greek: initiated into the mysteries) for the first eucharist of the Easter season. There is an interesting piece in this week&apos;s issue of the Catholic newspaper, the Tablet, in which Theo Hobson, an Anglican, says that Blair&apos;s likely defection illustrates how Britain&apos;s once- dominant Christian culture, Liberal Protestantism, has &quot;crumbled to dust&quot;, its market share captured by the &quot;tighter, tougher, more assertive&quot; alternatives of evangelism and the Roman church. Blair liked to believe that Anglicanism and Catholicism were both &quot;big tents&quot;, accessible to each other, but his exchange with Hume showed that the Catholicism was a different sort of big tent, &quot;one with a door policy and sharply-dressed bouncers to enforce it&quot;. This week I went to see the editor of the Tablet and on my way to the paper&apos;s offices in Hammersmith I was struck by how strange this destination was for me. An Islamic newspaper, a Sikh newspaper, a Jewish newspaper; none would have caused me a second thought. But for people of my background and generation the Tablet was different to those. I remembered how, long ago, we had to find Christmas cards for my grandmother that omitted the colour green (green = Ireland = Catholic, but is also, unhandily, the colour of holly) and how in Scotland Catholics appeared as a separate tribe, to be suspected for their political influence and mysterious rituals. My father, for example, used to insist they ran the BBC. These were prejudices and often had bad social consequences, but sometimes they had their roots in progressive secularism rather than anti-Irishness or Calvinism. In its history, the Tablet embodies the targets of many of those progressive arguments. It was founded by a convert from Quakerism in 1840, 11 years after the Act of Emancipation liberated religious worship, and several of its succeeding editors were also converts. Zealously, it upheld the doctrine of papal infallibility when it was introduced - controversially among many Catholics - in 1870. It opposed women&apos;s suffrage. It supported Franco. Converts themselves weren&apos;t immune to its rigours. When Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Black Mischief appeared in 1932, the Tablet refused to mention the title or the publisher and said the novel was &quot;a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name&quot;. All changed, of course. The Tablet has its first female editor, Catherine Pepinster (below), who came from the Independent four years ago. Most staff and writers are Catholic, but its pages are intellectually lively and impious (the misdoings of priests are scrupulously recorded), it sells more than ever, and is probably less Romeish than its rivals, the Universe and the Catholic Herald. When I asked Pepinster what the traditional attraction had been for converts, in the days when Catholicism scooped up so many big names (Waugh, Sitwell, Greene, Spark, Muggeridge), she said she thought it was because the Catholic church in England then seemed &quot;slightly exotic&quot;. To me, it still does. Catechumenates! Mystagogia! One of her colleagues, a convert, was puzzling over the question of his annulment, over why it was that if he had been born a Catholic and married in a register office he would not have needed an annulment because the church wouldn&apos;t have recognised the marriage, but because he had not been a Catholic when he married in a register office he did need an annulment now that he had become one. &quot;Why? Explain that to me!&quot; Many people, and I include myself here, would reply, &quot;Don&apos;t bother. Quit. Find another nice little church somewhere.&quot; One can only assume that the club rules, the big tent with a door policy, must be part of the attraction. People find many reasons to convert other than the strictly spiritual - the aesthetics and history on offer, the church as a refuge from materialism or carnality, or simply because your partner is a communicant and conversion makes family worship easier. When the writer Edward Sackville-West wrote to Evelyn Waugh in 1949 to tell him that he was preparing for his conversion, Waugh replied that conversion was &quot;like stepping across the chimney piece out of a Looking-glass-World, where everything is absurd caricature, into the real world God made; and then begins the delicious process of exploring it limitlessly&quot;. Yesterday, the feast day of St Paul and St Peter, I decided to see if I could catch a small part of this feeling and went for the first time to mass at the Blairs&apos; old church. As Pevsner says, the interior is handsome - bare, light, sparse, more Protestant than Catholic. There were about 50 in the congregation, very few under the age of 60. The priest was Irish, a woman read the lesson, another woman delivered to the priest the wine and the wafers, which the congregation eventually queued for. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. Aside from a few bells and responses, it might have been a ceremony devised on a busy day during the Reformation. &quot;Exotic&quot; it was not; hard to see how this plain fare would have attracted Edith Sitwell. Outside, across the road, was the empty delicatessen where Rocco used to make his pasta. Ten years ago Rocco had a picture on his wall showing him shaking hands with Tony Blair, taken just after Blair had made his post-church call to collect tortellini stuffed with lobster and prawns, the most expensive item by weight that Rocco sold. When Blair became less popular, Rocco took the picture down. This year, Rocco died of stomach cancer. This world, and not the promises of the service I had just left, seemed to me the one that was utterly real.

In January, the Israeli attorney general, Meni Mazuz, said he was planning to file rape charges that could carry a 20-year prison term.

His question belied the largely-held belief that life in the Shtachim (Territories) is akin to residing in a war-zone, and that settler parents are doing their offspring a massive injustice by exposing them to a daily diet of violence and fear. However, as I replied in my post, the residents themselves see their security set-up as anything but precarious. &quot;During an intifada, it&apos;s far more dangerous to live in the cities than in a settlement,&quot; declared one man we met in Kedumim, before going on to provide statistics to back up his claim. &quot;Suicide bombs killed six or seven residents of my hometown Petach Tikva - whereas no one was killed on our yeshuv,&quot; he said, knocking on the wood of his chair to ward off the evil eye. The assuredness that he displayed is a common trait of those we&apos;ve encountered - and it reaches far beyond their confidence in raising their own flesh and blood in the Shtachim. Many settlements have set up schools and study retreats for residents of Israel proper, and the students attend in their hundreds. The intentions of the settlers are noble enough - wanting to provide a quiet environment in the countryside conducive to study - but, at the same time, there&apos;s a marketing ploy going on beneath the surface. Yakov, a long-haired, post-army Israeli with dreams of India and Laos, is a student at the midrasha in Kfar Adumim where he has spent the last four months studying philosophy, religious texts and other material with a group of 15 others. He had no connection to the Shtachim before taking up his place at the school, yet is now seeking to extend his stay on the settlement well past July, when the study programme ends. He spends most of his free time swimming with his dog down at the wadi (gorge) near the school and his love of nature, combined with the tranquillity of the surroundings, means that he can see himself spending another six months living and working in Kfar Adumim. Politics plays no part in his desire to stay and that is just what is so alarming about his decision to remain. Through a combination of accessibility to the West Bank and stimulating activities once they arrive, the students are left with the impression of life in the Shtachim as no less appealing than English students might find a similar retreat in the rolling hills of Devon. There is no talk amongst the attendees of fear of attack, nor any politicised polemics about whether the land should be retained by Israel - instead, they are entirely normalised to the area during their four-month sojourn there. A similar situation exists in Kedumim, a settlement near Shechem (Nablus). One of the residents set up a school 12 years ago, exclusively for Ethiopian girls who live in &quot;bad&quot; neighbourhoods throughout Israel. His intention was that they should be able to escape the negative influences present in many development towns - drugs, crime and the like - as well as be provided with extra-curricular tuition, something that many Ethiopian parents are unable to provide at home. Again, the intention is nothing short of laudable but, at the same time, throwing the girls into the heart of the conflict has effects other than just providing them with better schooling. Mazal a 17-year-old religious student on the programme repeated the assertion that she felt safer in the West Bank than back home near Tel Aviv. &quot;Here, it is only Arabs that cause problems, whereas in the city, even Jews might attack you - the city is far more scary,&quot; she told us. Staying on the theme of fear and loathing, her friend Yafa then chose to interject and tell us: &quot;I&apos;m scared of all the Arabs&quot;. I asked her what she would say if someone told her they were &quot;scared of all the Ethiopians.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d laugh at them,&quot; she said, but wasn&apos;t prepared to accept that her take on &quot;all Arabs&quot; was equally hard to hold up to scrutiny. &quot;The image we have of Arabs is the problem,&quot; said Mazal. &quot;For example, the other day there was an Arab worker fixing the roof at school, and he had two shomrim [security guards] standing next to him the whole time. That made us think he must be dangerous.&quot; She conceded: &quot;there must be some good Arabs,&quot; but said that the impression they get of &quot;bad Arabs outweighs any impression we might have of good ones.&quot; With no contact between them and Arab students of the same age, it appears that the only Arabs they will come across whilst on Kedumim will always be surrounded by armed guards, thus reinforcing their stereotypes of all Arabs being dangerous. Both girls have become politically active since joining the school, have taken part in protests against the disengagement of Gush Katif in 2005. Mazal told me that &quot;of course land-for-peace doesn&apos;t work - just look at what&apos;s happening in Sderot.&quot; She said that she would happily live in the Shtachim, as and when she&apos;s married, &quot;assuming that my husband doesn&apos;t mind.&quot; This is what happens when the settlement doors are thrown open to the rest of Israel. Youths who would otherwise have little or no connection to the political situation find themselves drawn into the arena, exposed to the minutiae of life behind the Green Line, and - in many cases - are chewed up and spat out in the mould of settlers-to-be. The settlement enterprise thrives on the illusion of normality and, to all intents and purposes, much of what these students experience in the Shtachim is normal - on the surface at least. However, the peaceful atmosphere in which they study, or the still waters of the wadis in which they swim, can be easily branded trompe l&apos;oeil when it comes to the wider implications of living on such contested land. But, as long as all looks rosy to the influx of wide-eyed students who flock to the region, they are easily conditioned to see the area as exactly how the settlers want them to see it.

Chelsea&apos;s new director of football avoided interviews after arriving in English football last summer at Fratton Park perhaps conscious that some believed that his presence could cause a power struggle with the manager, Harry Redknapp. The same suggestion follows him at Chelsea, where the manager, Jose Mourinho, opposed his proposed appointment to help work with Andriy Shevchenko back in January. It was a time when Mourinho&apos;s relationship with Abramovich was believed to be at its most frosty. A thaw emerged after the FA Cup semi-final against Blackburn when the pair spoke for the first time in several months although confirmation of Grant&apos;s appointment at Chelsea is hardly likely to have resulted in a warming of the bond between the club&apos;s manager and owner. There appear to be differences between Mourinho and Abramovich over how to run a football club. Abramovich is understood to be bemused by the traditional English structure which affords such prominence to the manager. The appointment of Frank Arnesen and now Grant suggests a preference for a more continental arrangement where the manager has less power over the recruitment of players. Mourinho has already spoken of his admiration for the English tradition. &quot;I like the structure in the clubs, the typical philosophy, the meaning of the director and the manager and the working relations between one and the other,&quot; he said in April. &quot;It&apos;s different from what you normally get. Of course it can change. If one day I go back to these countries and these cultures I will try to change it to my new idea. But I feel it is perfect.&quot; The effect of Grant on Mourinho remains to be seen. The Israeli was introduced to Abramovich by the agent Pini Zahavi and his friendship with the Chelsea owner has been well documented. Although his appointment at Chelsea was expected, his elevation to a seat on the board did come as a surprise. Grant&apos;s background is in coaching and he never played professionally. He started his coaching career at Hapoel Petach Tikva and, after success with the youth and senior team, he moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, who he guided to a first league title in 13 years.  He went on to win two championships with Maccabi Haifa, the powerhouse of Israeli football. Grant then managed the national team although they missed out on qualifying for the 2006 World Cup despite remaining unbeaten in a group with the Republic of Ireland, France and Switzerland. His record in Israel splits footballing opinion. Grant&apos;s supporters say he is a charismatic and gifted coach but others question his achievements and say he should have done better as national team manager. All agree, though, that he has excellent man-management skills. He is also said to be ambitious and an excellent networker. Mourinho might be reassured by Grant&apos;s role at Portsmouth. He took the position of technical director and ended up friends with Redknapp, despite initial concerns that they might struggle to work closely together. Grant quickly developed the reputation as a charming, friendly individual who had no interest in undermining the manager. &quot;I&apos;ve found [him] to be very knowledgeable, an absolute gentleman and a nice person to have at the club - he has got a good knowledge of the game and of foreign players,&quot; said Redknapp. Although there was a degree of uncertainty about Grant&apos;s precise role, it soon became clear that he would have an active day-to-day involvement at the training ground. On his first day, he was out in the rain with the players in a tracksuit. And although it was the assistant manager, Tony Adams, and the first-team coach, Joe Jordan, who took most of the training sessions, Grant often stood watching and talking with Redknapp. The Israeli was also prominent on match days, sitting in the dug-out with Redknapp, Adams and Jordan. He would give Redknapp his input on tactics and substitutions, although he did not take any final decisions and his precise influence was questionable. &quot;He&apos;s more observational stuff - he observes a lot, he chats to the players and gives a small input,&quot; said the midfielder David Thompson, who has since moved to Bolton. &quot;I expect he gives his input to the manager behind the scenes, behind closed doors. He is quite philosophical and has a lot of comparisons in life - I found him to be quite an interesting guy.&quot; It has been suggested that Grant&apos;s appointment at Portsmouth was made by the club&apos;s owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, partly as a favour to Abramovich with the expectation that he would move to Chelsea. If so, it would explain Redknapp&apos;s relaxed attitude and also indicate that he may intend to take a much more prominent role at Chelsea.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-09T23:09:02Z", "title": "Football: Grant's first task is to build bridges at Chelsea", "sentences": ["He started his coaching career at Hapoel Petach Tikva and, after success with the youth and senior team, he moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, who he guided to a first league title in 13 years."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/10/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Peace Now&apos;s latest report into Israeli settlement activity might soothe the consciences of those who compiled and disseminated it, but it is cold comfort to those it seeks to assist. In essence, the lengthy and detailed file exposes the settlement enterprise as continuing to flourish unchecked, and unconstrained by the rule of law. It asserts that, even though settlers use only 12% of the land officially allocated to them, a third of the territory that they do employ is outside the confines of what they are permitted by law to call their own. The Israeli government has perfected the art of turning a blind eye to illegal settlement expansion over the last decade, and the settlers make use of the scant attention paid to their activity by ceaselessly annexing more land and hastily constructing houses on it. By calling their new settlements merely &quot;outposts&quot; of existing ones, the settlers get away with their actions, and the government can still attest to no &quot;new settlements&quot; having been erected during the last ten years. But this duplicity fools no one on the ground, least of all the advocacy groups such as Peace Now whose main aims are to challenge the illegal settlement activity and try to reverse the current expansionist trends. However, with every report published, the cards look increasingly stacked against the activist movements&apos; call to arms. They sound more and more like the proverbial tree falling in a forest with no one there to hear. The Israeli public knows how to mobilise and take action when it sees fit - the people have a long history of rising up against detested policies when they feel the government is leading the country up the garden path. However, given the reaction to Peace Now&apos;s efforts - reaction which ranges from silent apathy to outright opposition, depending on the recipients&apos; political leanings - it would appear that no stack of paperwork hurled at the electorate is either detailed enough nor damning enough to stir them out of their indifference. The settlers know this, which is why they continue to mill about like well-drilled Doozers, building wherever they see fit, safe in the knowledge that nothing of significance is likely to come of Peace Now&apos;s posturing. There is, perhaps, another way for the Peace Now camp to proceed in their struggle. Instead of preaching to the converted, as they do when firing off their missives via Haaretz and its ilk, they could take their allegations and meet the settlers head on. By engaging in dialogue with those that they are taking to task, they might find that there are those on the settler side willing to take up their cause from the inside. After all, several of the settlers we&apos;ve met with on our trip claim to have Meretz voters as neighbours in their settlements - strange bedfellows they may be, but they could prove invaluable for the likes of Peace Now. However, given the outright hostility that exists between the two camps, there isn&apos;t much likelihood of Peace Now drumming up much useful support among the West Bank&apos;s Jewish residents. Incendiary rhetoric employed for years by the peace camp against the settlers, and vice versa, has ensured that these two groups are doomed to do nothing but lock horns for years to come. And, in the absence of the army or government stepping in to quell the illegal construction, there&apos;s really no one left to turn to for assistance in remedying the situation. I&apos;ve heard it suggested that for every illegal outpost that springs up overnight, a group of leftwing activists could arrive the next morning and take it down brick by brick just as swiftly. Both actions are equally extrajudicial (in fact, if anything, the dismantling would be slightly more justifiable by law), hence both require the participation of activists undeterred by the threat of arrest and imprisonment. The settlers have this type of determined supporters in spades, which is why they are so adept at this kind of activity. The left, on the other hand, always appears content to hand-wring in newspaper columns or in bourgeois Tel Aviv cafes, without achieving anything concrete in its quest. In the absence of a responsive or concerned government, this kind of armchair protesting is pretty futile and does nothing to alter the facts on the ground. Peace Now can trumpet its findings all it likes, and it will, but it needs to find another way to take on the might of the settlement juggernaut. Because this road leads nowhere, as the leftwing well know. The only winners are the settlers, who can, once again, thumb their noses at the law and continue unhindered in their illegal expansion, as the left boos and hisses ineffectually from the sidelines.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-10T08:30:00Z", "title": "Reports won't stop Jewish settlers", "sentences": ["The left, on the other hand, always appears content to hand-wring in newspaper columns or in bourgeois Tel Aviv cafes, without achieving anything concrete in its quest."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/10/peacenowreport"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Trade unions", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Out pounding the streets of Efrat the other day, (my cousin and co-blogger) Josh and I walked past a building site where a few labourers toiled away in the afternoon sun. As we turned the corner, we saw another of the workers sitting down in the shade of an olive tree eating his lunch, so we stopped and struck up a conversation with him. What we learned from the brief chat served to reaffirm to us the atrocious state of affairs that exists for Palestinians who are &quot;lucky&quot; enough to find employment with Israeli contractors, who shamelessly exploit them with no regard for anything other than their own profit margins. Clad in a ragged t-shirt emblazoned with the logo of an Israeli building company, Boel [not his real name] glanced furtively around him, then agreed to talk to us for a few minutes, while the coast was clear. And the coast needed to be clear for him to be able to converse with strangers, since the state of play in Efrat is such that Palestinian labourers are banned from every activity other than silently doing the job that they were employed to do. Contravention of the rules will result in his permit to work being instantly withdrawn, said Boel, &quot;and I&apos;ll end up sitting outside my house all day, with no way to feed my family&quot;. &quot;If I want to go to collect supplies from the gate, the guard must come with me&quot;, he told us. &quot;If I want to go to the toilet, the guard must come with me too. If I want to speak to anyone other than my fellow workers, the guard must be present. In fact, I can&apos;t even walk more than 20 metres away from the guard, otherwise he&apos;ll call the police and have me kicked out of the area.&quot; To all intents and purposes, Boel is afforded as much freedom as a rottweiler chained to a gatepost; his invisible shackles are closely monitored by the gun-toting guard, upon whose whims rest Boel&apos;s entire livelihood, and who must be treated with suitably fawning respect by Boel. Boel receives 100 shekels (\u00a311.75) a day for an eight-hour shift - equivalent to the pittance that the &quot;basket children&quot; earn in the Mahane Yehuda souk in downtown Jerusalem. However, even though the basket children&apos;s wages are pitiful, it is somewhat more understandable given that they are underage, unskilled workers. Boel, on the other hand, is in his mid-30s and has a wife and kids to feed - plus he&apos;s been working in the building trade for years. Naturally, given the indifference of his employers - as well as the government, which refuses to enforce the labour laws - there is no insurance policy in place to assist Boel and his friends in the result of accident or injury. Boel laughed bitterly at the idea that anyone would care enough to provide such cover. &quot;If I get hurt, then I don&apos;t work and I don&apos;t earn,&quot; he said. &quot;Plus I have to deduct any medical expenses from the hundred shekels I earned that day.&quot; Despite all of this, Boel actually feels fortunate to be working on the Efrat project. There is no work whatsoever for him in his home village, and the alternative to this job would be to seek employment illegally in Tel Aviv or Haifa. There, he said, the exploitation is even more severe, where those hiring know that they have the workers over a barrel, since Palestinian ID-holders aren&apos;t allowed in those areas at all. &quot;Over there, the work isn&apos;t even fit for dogs or donkeys,&quot; Boel said. &quot;And any Arab who tries to sleep on the site overnight will get attacked by the soldiers on patrol. I have a friend from my village who was heavily beaten with a stick by a soldier - he ended up in hospital, and he can&apos;t even see anymore, let alone work.&quot; The abuse isn&apos;t always physical, Boel told us. &quot;Here in Efrat, the guards empty out my food containers every day searching for weapons, even though they&apos;ve known me for 20 years. Everything that the Israelis do to the Arabs is no good,&quot; he stated flatly, instantly conflating his parochial experiences with a far wider assessment of how the two sides interact. &quot;In the Qur&apos;an, it says that the Israelis will do this to us for years,&quot; he said, finding solace for his predicament through his religious learning. &quot;But it also says that our time will come. This won&apos;t go on forever.&quot; The chicken-and-egg situation in the region means that both sides can excuse their own abhorrent behaviour toward one another. Efrat residents we met told us &quot;it&apos;s a shame we have to treat the Arab workers like that, but they&apos;ve attacked us from within before&quot;, referring to several murders that were perpetrated by Palestinian workers over the last few years. And, on the other side, when the likes of Boel see and experience the rampant racism and oppression that he&apos;s on the receiving end of every day, it&apos;s little wonder that the more militant among his community rise up and lash out against their subjugators. There&apos;s no way out of the impasse while these perceptions persist. If we keep Palestinian workers chained up like dogs while they work, we&apos;re never going to win their hearts and minds. If they, in turn, resort to indiscriminate violence against Israelis to exact revenge for their mistreatment, they&apos;ll find their pleas for a better life falling on deaf ears among those who once might have heeded their calls. In the meantime, however, a wage increase and insurance cover for workers such as Boel would go some way to alleviating his valid concerns that his Israeli employers couldn&apos;t really care less about his welfare. However, he - along with anyone else familiar with the status quo here - won&apos;t be holding his breath for change any time soon.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-12T11:00:00Z", "title": "A dog's life", "sentences": ["There is no work whatsoever for him in his home village, and the alternative to this job would be to seek employment illegally in Tel Aviv or Haifa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/12/adogslife"}, {"tags": ["Photography", "Culture", "Art and design"], "article": "Kinneret was a gorgeous 22-year-old girl who was putting herself through college by working in a coffee shop in Tel Aviv.

She doesn&apos;t remember anything, but she was standing beside bottles of alcohol and wearing synthetic clothes, so her entire back and every inch of her body suffered burns. The doctors didn&apos;t think she would live. Three months later, I met Kinneret for the first time. When I walked into her hospital room, she had this amazing smile. It lit up the room, even though she was incredibly difficult to look at. I thought: &quot;Wow, if she can sit there and say she feels lucky to be alive, with no anger inside her, then this is somebody I can really learn from.&quot; I don&apos;t want to make out that she&apos;s not human, because obviously she suffers, but her allowing me to take this picture a year and a half later was a big deal for me. This is her bedroom in Tel Aviv. She&apos;s wearing a pressure suit, which she wore for two years after the bombing to hold the skin together so that it would heal. She was in constant pain, but you never really heard her complain. It was taken at around 4am. Besides her physical rehabilitation, Kinneret couldn&apos;t be outside in the sun. So she and her friends became nocturnal: during the day, she would sleep, and everyone would come to her house at 11pm. She was just getting her life back together, though she and her boyfriend were in the process of breaking up. I hope that the picture is not about her actual wounds. That was the hardest thing, making a picture that wouldn&apos;t sensationalise her injuries, but would show that she transcends them.

An African-American Hasid calling for unity. Another Israeli-Palestinian in favour of two states for two peoples. An Ashkenazi from Jerusalem, complaining about his failure to get on to television. And, presiding over it all, a Modern Orthodox DJ who, without a trace of irony, sports a T-shirt saying &quot;Settlement&quot;. Everyone together, despite all the differences. This is neither the start of a bad joke or a beautiful dream. Rather, it&apos;s an illustration of the power of hip-hop. Last week Levantin 7 in Tel Aviv hosted another instalment of the Hip-Hop Sulha. Sulha is the term for the traditional Arabic reconciliation ceremony. The idea is to get all the disputants together in one place for a mediation ceremony. In this modern version, the mediation takes place through hip-hop. The participants were Jerusalem MC Sagol 59, Saz and Dam from Ramle, Y-Love from Brooklyn, and DJ Handler from New York. As a bit of a hip-hop snob, wedded to New York traditionalism, I wasn&apos;t expecting so much. But, despite the earnestness, the show rocked. Particularly impressive was Saz, who had quite an extraordinary stage presence. Closer to the world&apos;s hip-hop heartlands, he would be a star. More striking than the music, however, was the incredibly plurality of ideas on display. And I couldn&apos;t help thinking that this sulha literally illustrated the validity of Amartya Sen&apos;s thesis in Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny. In the book, Sen argues a third way between the divisions caused by nationalism/ethnocentrism and the banality of stating: &quot;at heart we&apos;re all the same.&quot; Instead, he argues, we must focus on emphasising the plurality of ways in which we identify ourselves. We may be Jews or Israelis or Muslims or Palestinians. But we are also men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, jazz fans or literature lovers, football supporters or baseball followers. By promoting these different identities, we can subsume the violence caused by extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism. In the case at hand, what brought everyone together was hip-hop. In other contexts, the political divisions between the MCs might have been too much to handle. But at the sulha everyone was able to come together under the banner of hip-hop, providing a perfect umbrella for opinions to be aired freely. So Dam called for a one-state solution while reprimanding Israel for murdering people in Gaza and Saz called for two-states. Sagol 59 preferred to bemoan his lack of star status. But at the end, everyone came together to freestyle, to honour the hustle that is incumbent upon Israelis and Palestinians that dare to express themselves through rap. I don&apos;t know what the boycotters would make of it. Would they welcome the Hip-Hop Sulha to Britain? No doubt they would require Sagol 59 and DJ Handler to withdraw, which would kind of defeat the purpose of the whole thing, but there you go. Either way, I know that getting Israeli-Jews to sing along to a song in Arabic that calls for one state is far more subversive than the constant efforts to ban Israeli academics. To appreciate this, though, you need some sense of irony, which is sadly lacking in the pro-boycott movement. The Hip-Hop Sulha is a model for peacemaking: bring people together on the basis of a shared passion that is not dependent on their national identity. Let them air their views freely. And let the punters go off into the night with challenging food for thought.

The first I heard of the incendiary campaign was an email on Monday urging me to sign my name and help prevent the impending calamity - in the three days that followed the floodgates burst and my inbox overflowed from the deluge. Incredulous at the sheer force of the electronic crusade I was witnessing, I replied to one of the senders and asked him if he had included me on his list by accident. &quot;You must be joking if you think I&apos;m signing this&quot;, I told him, &quot;I&apos;m a Guardian boy - remember?&quot; His response spoke volumes about the extent to which he and his fellow cyber-warriors had lost the plot: &quot;It&apos;s for a mosque ... do you want to see a big mosque when you fly into London?&quot; A mosque? Not just a mosque, but a big one to boot? And one so thoughtlessly placed that it could impede my enjoyment as my plane headed for the tarmac at Heathrow? Much as I tried to share his horror at the prospect of the proposed structure, I found myself struggling to raise much more than an arched eyebrow at the scenario he was depicting. On the other hand, the fact that this was the 12th copy of the petition I&apos;d received from a fellow Jew within 72 hours got my hackles rising quicker than an El-Al 747 taking off from Tel Aviv. What business is it of the Jewish community whether the mosque is built or not? And more to the point, how could those engaged in flinging that petition around north London and beyond (at lightning speed) not see the unashamedly discriminatory nature of their campaign? As Inayat Bunglawala pointed out in his article yesterday, most of the &quot;facts&quot; being disseminated about the planned shrine are false - but this is beside the point when it comes to the bandwagon-jumping by certain elements of the Jewish community, hell-bent on halting the project. Whether the mosque is slated to hold a hundred or a hundred thousand people is immaterial, given the underlying message that here was a group of Jews joining forces to oppose another religion&apos;s place of worship. For a minority group more than familiar with hostile opposition and unfettered persecution, it is an utter disgrace that they should sink to the same level in such an unabashed manner. Do they not remember their own history? Are they completely unaware that the sentiments behind repugnant campaigns such as &quot;scrap the mega mosque&quot; are no different from those of the book-burning mobs who engineered Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany? There&apos;s no point pulling punches on this issue - the vicious racism fuelling the anti-mosque appeal is no different from anything the Jews have suffered for the bulk of their history. So, for sections of the Jewish public not only to stay silent on the issue, but actively to jump aboard, is as abhorrent as it is absurd. For my part, I couldn&apos;t care less one way or the other whether the mosque is built, since it has absolutely nothing to do with me and its erection wouldn&apos;t impact on my world in the slightest. If the Jews campaigning against it can&apos;t see that, then they&apos;ve allowed their paranoid delusions to run away with them. It&apos;s a mosque, for heaven&apos;s sake, not an al-Qaida training camp. For Jews to cry wolf when a mosque is planned demonstrates how very completely they have tarred the entire Muslim community with the same demonising brush. And, if the tables were turned and a super-synagogue was scheduled to be built in the middle of Golders Green, you can bet that those Jews expressing outrage today would be the ones dancing in the streets when the new shul opened its doors. They wouldn&apos;t complain for an instant that the money could be better spent on the NHS or London transport. They wouldn&apos;t bat an eyelid at how many incoming tourists would notice the complex dominating the London skyline as their plane descended through the clouds. And they certainly wouldn&apos;t stand idly by as a barrage of hate-filled emails raced around the country calling for the public to take up their cudgels and derail the project. If, as was reported, over 260,000 people have shown their true colours and signed the &quot;Christian population&apos;s&quot; petition, then that&apos;s pretty reprehensible in its own right and well worthy of condemnation in the press. But if, as is the case, even a single signatory comes from the community that I grew up in, then there is an urgent need for those appalled by their actions to distance themselves entirely from the situation. We Jews should be speaking out in droves against the vicious petition and all it represents. However, if we don&apos;t, then the least we could do is stay silent, and not take the opportunity to stick the knife into the Muslim community ourselves.

A new Home Office report reveals among other things, a significant upswing in alcohol-related crime between the hours of 3am and 6am since the licensing laws were overhauled in November 2005. And a survey carried out at St Thomas&apos;s in London, the city&apos;s largest accident and emergency department, records similarly alarming trends, in particular that the number of alcohol-related admissions at night has trebled since the so-called 24-hour European-style drinking laws came into effect. Of course, it all sounded perfectly plausible on paper. Before the reforms, Britain&apos;s pubs were packed with drinkers racing against the clock and the government naively thoeorised that by doing away with that ticking clock, the country&apos;s drinkers would kick back and drink more slowly. Drinking slowly would mean less rapid intoxication, which in turn would do away with the mass national public drunkeness that historically accompanied closing time. That, in turn, would take the pressure off the police and A&amp;E departments, who would instead be able to tackle alcohol-related crimes and cases over a broader time frame - and hopefully fewer of them. So far, logical enough. But what the government failed to factor in was that in relaxing the licensing laws, all they were doing were treating the symptoms of our sickly national drinking culture, not the root cause. And the findings of these new reports seem to offer the first blocks of evidence for a compelling case arguing that Britain has a massive cultural problem with alcohol. The government needs to wake up and realise that it is not going to cut alcohol-related crime, alcohol-related injuries, alcohol-related admissions at A&amp;E departments and rising rates of adolescent binge drinking, adult alcohol dependence and alcoholism, by reforming licensing laws or reviewing the pricing of alcoholic drinks. The problem lies with us, as a nation. We&apos;re obsessed with alcohol; it sits at the centre of our culture. With few other exceptions, perhaps Poland, Russia, Australia and Germany being obvious examples, we&apos;re practically alone in the world in terms of how much we revel in drinking as a people. I&apos;ve got friends in France, Spain, Italy, the States, Brazil, Algeria, Iran, Israel - and all of them at one time or another have expressed disbelief and disgust at the British drinking culture. One of my wife&apos;s relatives came to visit from Tel Aviv and she actually asked if we could show her the &quot;drunken crazy British people on a Saturday night&quot; that she&apos;d heard about. It&apos;s world famous, this culture of falling about and punching strangers and being sick in the street, as British as fish &apos;n&apos; chips. We&apos;re raised from a young age, here, to think drinking is a laugh, the benchmark of a good time. Alcohol, we&apos;re told, is fun. As teenagers, it&apos;s all about being sick and forgetting what you did last night. Later, as adults, you notice the country&apos;s vernacular is teeming with drinking references. Just a quick half then. A few pints. Got quite a thirst on me. Oh go on then. Big night, last night. If you want to have a social life, you quickly learn to speak the language. You also soon learn that drinking&apos;s a good career booster too. For instance, I once got promoted for getting drunk at a company party. Inebriated beyond belief, on a dare, I chucked a jug of cream in the managing director&apos;s face. In any other country in the world, I would have been fired for such behaviour. But instead, here, I was toasted as a &quot;lad&quot; the following morning, given a promotion that afternoon, because the MD, a notorious lunchtime drinker, apparently thought I was &quot;a laugh and rather cheeky&quot;. The same company eventually fired me. Not because I was always hungover or because I ended up in hospital with alcoholism, but because I got sober and became thereafter stubbornly and necessarily avoidant of pub lunches and boozy dinners. No longer a laugh or evidently cheeky, they let me go. Which brings me on to how, at large, socially, we&apos;re a people who struggle with the concept of the non-drinker. Go to a dinner or a party in the States or Italy, for example, and you won&apos;t be out in the cold for not drinking. Here, people treat the non-drinker with paranoia, suspicion, fear even. To not drink in Britain, is to not play the game. As a recovering alcoholic, when I go to parties, dinners, meetings and so on, when I order water or a soft drink, there&apos;s always a collective gulp among the drinkers at the table. Don&apos;t spoil our fun, their faces seem to say. As per the stereotypes of our international reputation, we&apos;re also often an uptight people, reserved, tense, not very good at confrontation, afraid to complain, unfriendly, wary of strangers and so on. That&apos;s where alcohol comes in. It holds a special place in our culture as the means by which we let our hair down, air our grievances, speak what&apos;s on our minds, say what we really think. It&apos;s the great social lubricant, icebreaker, entertainer. And above all else, it&apos;s synonymous with fun. If you don&apos;t drink, you won&apos;t have fun, goes the unofficial national anthem. Assessing the findings of these reports, it&apos;s becoming clear that the government is wasting its time playing about with licensing laws and pricing and so on. Treating the symptoms of our drinking culture will achieve nothing. They need to somehow treat the cultural root itself. Maybe they need to impress a different message on school age children about alcohol which challenges the mythical position that drinking holds in our culture. Maybe it&apos;s not a government issue at all, but instead a matter for this generation of parents who need to pass along a different message about drinking to their children - to tell them that yes, it can be fun, it can be relaxing, it can be a pleasure, but it can also hurt people, destroy reputations and wreck lives.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-20T16:00:00Z", "title": "Having a good time?", "sentences": ["One of my wife&apos;s relatives came to visit from Tel Aviv and she actually asked if we could show her the &quot;drunken crazy British people on a Saturday night&quot; that she&apos;d heard about."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/20/havingagoodtime"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "Tony Blair", "Labour", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Jordan"], "article": "Tony Blair flew into the Middle East today for his first visit as a special international envoy hoping to produce a fresh peace initiative from long-stalled negotiations.

For 50 years he wrote for the liberal daily, Ha&apos;aretz. From the 1970s onwards, Schiff wrote numerous books and participated in secret talks with Egyptians, Syrians, north Africans and latterly Iranians. Though a confidant of the powerful, Schiff reserved his right to criticise them publicly. After the 2006 war in Lebanon, for instance, he chastised &quot;belligerent statements&quot;, systemic incompetence, hasty decision-making, and leaders who allowed six years of policing the intifada to distort military strategy. &quot;The IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) once excelled as a regular army. The territories ruined it,&quot; he wrote. Generals and lay people alike turned to Schiff, and not only in Israel. His books were translated into Russian and Arabic, and his articles, which the Saudi-owned news-site Elaph praised as &quot;controversial and fascinating&quot;, appeared in the New York Times, Middle East Journal, Washington Post, Lebanon&apos;s Daily Star and the journals Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs. Authoritative, astute, encyclopaedic in his knowledge and rigorous in his assessments, Schiff rendered complicated concepts in clear, accessible prose. Through contacts in Amman and Cairo he offered Israelis insight into their neighbours&apos; aspirations. His holistic approach considered how water disputes, psychology and economic factors all underpinned military decisions. While discreet and soft-spoken, Schiff seldom minced his words. Just as he criticised a future Palestinian state bereft of Jews, so he called the occupation a &quot;cancer&quot; on Israeli society. In 1987 he characterised army units dominated by settlers as a security threat, and demanded their disbandment. A stickler for integrity, decades earlier he lacerated military governors who arbitrarily rescinded travel permits to Arab citizens. Schiff, or &quot;Wolfy&quot; to his friends (Ze&apos;ev means wolf in Hebrew), was hard to pigeonhole. At times he could sound apocalyptic. &quot;Misreading history risks catastrophe,&quot; he warned in 2001. Israel&apos;s precipitous May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon, he felt, stoked the Palestinian uprising five months later. In mid-2006 he openly called for the destruction of Hizbollah. Yet he also said things other Israeli journalists dared not utter, precisely because of the esteem in which he was held. Unilateral disengagement was by definition impossible, argued Schiff. While decrying &quot;murderous Palestinian terrorism&quot; he was equally scathing about the number of innocents killed in retaliatory raids. As early as 1994 he called Israel, Palestine and Jordan &quot;one geographic and demographic bloc&quot;; thus only tripartite agreement could ensure peace. Schiff and his protege Ehud Ya&apos;ari wrote about Israeli-abetted &quot;war crimes&quot; in their much-praised Israel&apos;s Lebanon War (published in English in 1985). The book blamed Ariel Sharon for pursuing a foolhardy personal campaign. Twenty years later Schiff accused Sharon of &quot;causing chaos&quot; by hiding behind the mantra &quot;there is no one to talk to&quot;. Why not speak to the currently imprisoned Marwan Barghouti, a &quot;charismatic, popular and worthy Palestinian negotiating partner&quot;, he asked. He also chided the 2004 Bush-Sharon concord for disregarding Palestinians over cardinal matters. Ya&apos;ari and Schiff followed Lebanon War with Intifada: the Palestinian Uprising, which appeared in English in 1990. An international bestseller, Intifada revealed how the revolt caught PLO chief Arafat by surprise, and how Israel had myopically funded Islamic groups that in 1988 turned into Hamas. Schiff never let political disagreements descend into personal animosity. Affable, generous, and charming, he always remembered everyone&apos;s name. Despite his ubiquitous internet presence, he remained old school, preferring notepads to laptops, and direct contact to emails. Sometimes Schiff&apos;s strongest pieces were deceptively quiet - such as his description of a plane flight over Israel that he shared with Iraqis, Palestinians and Gulf Arabs in 1995. Taking advantage of Jordan&apos;s 1994 peace treaty with Jerusalem, Schiff&apos;s Arab colleagues were viewing the &quot;enemy&quot; for the first time. Schiff was born in France, and arrived in Mandatory Palestine as a three-year-old. He sent carrier pigeons to sources in Jordan while working for IDF intelligence. He joined Ha&apos;aretz in 1955 after studying Middle East affairs and military history at Tel Aviv University. Having served as a correspondent in Vietnam, the Soviet Union, Cyprus and Ethiopia, Schiff returned to become a reporter during the 1967 war, and Israel&apos;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In this role he raised the alarm about Sabra and Shatilla, and was a key source at the subsequent inquiry into the massacre. Renowned for his scrupulousness, in 1977 Schiff moderated Israel&apos;s first televised debate between aspirant prime ministers, Shimon Peres and Menachem Begin (obituary, March 10 1992). He was a trustee of Britain&apos;s International Institute of Strategic Studies, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and held the Brochstein chair in peace and security at the James Baker III Institute for Public Policy, Rice University, in Houston, Texas. In March 2003 he concluded that the Middle East was &quot;standing at the edge of an abyss&quot;. Only war could force Saddam Hussein&apos;s compliance with proper weapons inspection, he argued. But it should be timely, swift and restricted in its aims. Just a month later, Schiff presciently warned of pitfalls in America&apos;s Iraqi venture. He spoke of arrogant behaviour by GIs, the inadvisability of occupation, the danger posed by insurgents and ignorance of local feeling. Schiff also co-wrote Fedayeen: Guerrillas Against Israel (1972); October Earthquake and the Yom Kippur War (1974); and A History of the Israeli Army: 1874 to the Present (1974, revised in 1985). Then followed Entebbe Rescue (1977) and The Year of the Dove (1979, with Eitan Haber), about the Egyptian/Israeli peace breakthrough. He also wrote The Saladin Syndrome: Lessons from the Gulf War (1991); A Lexicon of the Israeli Army; and, together with Hussein Agha, Shai Feldman and Ahmad Khalidi, Track II Diplomacy: Lessons from the Middle East (2003). Schiff could oscillate between hope and gloom. Days before his death from heart disease, he lamented Israel&apos;s failure to stop Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza as a &quot;national disgrace&quot;. Increasingly he wrote of Iran as Israel&apos;s greatest threat. Yet he marked the 40th anniversary of the six day war with optimism. While the Arab League&apos;s 1967 conference in Khartoum had rejected peace, their 2007 Riyadh summit pledged recognition of Israel. Schiff wrote how a &quot;bumpy 40-year ride strewn with bloody wars&quot; had led to a fundamental attitudinal change - one that demanded &quot;wise, courageous policies&quot; and &quot;compromise&quot; on Israel&apos;s part. Ultimately Schiff believed that true security came from talking - or &quot;making peace, despite the risks&quot;.

Opinion polls showed unprecedented public support for the conflict. Politicians and pundits crowded television studios to argue that Israel was fighting for its survival in its battle to wipe out Hizbullah. But one Israeli MP saw it differently. Hizbullah, he wrote, was a resistance movement, fighting a war brought on by an Israeli government led by &quot;mediocrities, cowards and opportunists&quot; who were responsible for &quot;barbaric vandalism and the deliberate targeting of civilians&quot;. After a decade as a member of parliament in the Knesset, Azmi Bishara, politician, author and academic, had long established a reputation as the most outspoken political figure to emerge from Israel&apos;s Arab minority. Soon after the war was over, Bishara and a handful of MPs from his Balad party travelled to Syria and Lebanon, both &quot;enemy states&quot;, where he continued to denounce his government. He did not have to wait long for a reaction: in September the Israeli attorney general ordered police to begin a criminal investigation. It wasn&apos;t the first inquiry into Bishara&apos;s activities, and so he was not surprised when six months later he was called in to Petah Tikva police station, near Tel Aviv, for questioning. He twice met two police officers and then left for what he insists was a prearranged speaking tour to Jordan. It was only while he was away that investigators leaked details of the case to the Israeli press. Although Bishara has not been charged, it has now emerged that he is under investigation for money laundering, contact with a foreign agent, delivery of information to the enemy and, most seriously, assistance to the enemy during war - a charge that can carry the death penalty. These are some of the most serious allegations ever levelled against an Israeli MP and effectively mean that Bishara must either remain in exile abroad, or return to face the prospect of a lengthy jail sentence, or worse. But Bishara is also the most prominent advocate of Arab political rights within Israel, and the investigation has exposed a widening rift in Israeli society between the Jewish majority and the 20% Palestinian minority. Bishara has not returned home. In April he handed in his resignation from the Knesset at the Israeli embassy in Cairo. For now he is living with his wife and two young children in a friend&apos;s empty flat in an apartment block in Amman, Jordan. &quot;The symbolic action of bringing me to trial and condemning me - they want it. I know they want it,&quot; he says, in a rare interview with the Guardian. &quot;I&apos;m not going to let them succeed; I&apos;m always two steps ahead.&quot; He sits back on the sofa, dressed in a polo shirt and chinos, with his mobile phones laid out on the coffee table. On a desk behind him is a laptop and on it the draft of a new book he is writing about democracy in the Arab world. Bishara denies the accusations brought against him, and argues that the real reason for the investigation is not his actions during the Lebanon war but his long-held and widely published call for a fundamental change to the nature of the Israeli state: his belief that the country should no longer be a Jewish state but must protect Arab rights and become a &quot;state for all its citizens&quot;. &quot;They want to condemn the whole political ideology and put it as if it&apos;s a cover for another kind of activity, which is not true,&quot; he says. In March, the Israeli mass-market Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper published a story reporting that wire-tappings conducted by the Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s domestic intelligence service, had recorded Bishara&apos;s conversations during the war. It said he spoke to &quot;Hizbullah contacts&quot; and directed them to &quot;optimal targets for their rockets&quot;. It also reported that he had obtained &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash&quot; through money-changers in east Jerusalem, using such codewords as &quot;book&quot;, which the newspaper said meant $50,000, &quot;English&quot;, which it said meant dollars, and &quot;Hebrew&quot;, which it said meant shekels. &quot;Investigators said they knew Bishara was using codewords because he suspected he was being wire-tapped; they said they burst into fits of laughter when Bishara placed an order for &apos;Half a book, in English,&apos; meaning $25,000,&quot; the newspaper reported. Bishara insists the allegations are untrue. He says he did not speak to anyone from Hizbullah during the war. &quot;Is it true I have been on the phone? Yes, and people were listening. But was I speaking to Hizbullah? The answer is no.&quot; He did speak to politicians and journalists in Syria and Lebanon, but said he had no secret information to pass on. &quot;We don&apos;t have that kind of information to pass to anybody,&quot; he says. &quot;What could I say that&apos;s not in the media? It&apos;s unbelievable. It&apos;s not serious at all.&quot; The allegations of money laundering, he says, are &quot;nonsense&quot;, and when he used the word &quot;book&quot; in his phone conversations with a money-changer he says he was talking only about books they had lent each other. &quot;It was about books, really about books. He kept taking books from me and giving me books. He&apos;s a real book collector. He reads. But that&apos;s all,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a whole case of turning political, ideological, intellectual activity into a security suspicion.&quot; Bishara is a Roman Catholic and a leftist, born into a lower-middle-class family in Nazareth. His father was a health inspector, trade unionist and one-time communist, his mother a teacher. During the 1948 war, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes, Bishara&apos;s family stayed on in the country that became Israel. Bishara studied at Haifa and Hebrew universities, and his Communist party connections offered him the chance to take a doctorate in philosophy at Humboldt University in East Berlin in the 1980s. Like most Arabs in Israel, he rejects establishment definitions and describes his nationality as simply Arab Palestinian. Born in an Israeli city eight years after the creation of the state of Israel, he holds Israeli citizenship, which makes him part of the country&apos;s 20% Arab minority and entitles him to vote and to stand for election to parliament. He can trace his family back hundreds of years to a village north of Nazareth, in what is today northern Israel. Before his resignation, his Balad party held only four seats in the Knesset in a country where many Arab Israelis still tend to vote for the mainstream political parties, particularly Labour - now part of the ruling coalition. Even Bishara admits there is not widespread public support for his ideas among his own community. One opinion poll earlier this year found that three-quarters of Arab Israelis would support a constitution describing Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. However, in recent months, that has begun to change. For a start, racism against Arabs in Israel is rising, according to at least one recent poll. In a survey for the Centre Against Racism, a poll of Jewish Israelis found that more than half believed it was treason for a Jewish woman to marry an Arab man; 40% said Arabs should no longer have the right to vote in parliamentary elections; and 75% opposed apartment blocks being shared by Jews and Arabs. At the same time, more and more prominent Arab Israelis are adopting ideas similar to Bishara&apos;s and proposing a fundamental challenge to the Jewish nature of the state. Four separate documents have emerged since December, each making a similar case. Adalah, a human rights group, issued a draft constitution that said Israel should be defined not as a Jewish state but as a &quot;democratic, bilingual and multicultural state&quot;. It called for an end to the Law of Return, which gives automatic citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent, and it called on Israel to &quot;recognise its responsibility for past injustices suffered by the Palestinian people&quot;. Then, earlier this month, in a remarkable interview with the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper, Avraham Burg, a Jewish former speaker of the Knesset and former chair of the Jewish Agency, delivered his own denunciation of Israel&apos;s structure. &quot;It can&apos;t work any more,&quot; he said. &quot;To define the state of Israel as a Jewish state is the key to its end. A Jewish state is explosive. It&apos;s dynamite.&quot; Burg too called for a change to the Law of Return and was highly critical of what he called Israel&apos;s &quot;confrontational Zionism&quot;. For Bishara, such comments only reinforce his long-held opinions. &quot;Everything is said as if there is an elephant in the room that nobody wants to speak about, which is called a state of all its citizens,&quot; he says. &quot;But the idea won. This idea now is the real rival of the Zionist state. This is the first time you have a real challenge.&quot; The Law of Return, he argues, is a fundamental problem, as is the idea of a state both Jewish and democratic. &quot;The problem with this state is that it cannot grant equality. It cannot separate religion and state, and it will always have an ideological mission that will keep it from integrating in the region or serving its citizens.&quot; He describes Israel as a &quot;colonial democracy&quot;. &quot;The basic relationship between a state and its citizens should be citizenship, not ethnic or religious affiliation,&quot; he says. &quot;Who is a citi-zen of Israel? Is my cousin in Lebanon who left the country in 1948 allowed to come back or not? This is basic. But somebody who can prove that his mother is Jewish, from Brooklyn - he can come.&quot; However, the reality is that there is little chance that any of these ideas will become law in the near future. Israel does not have a constitution and, though there are frequently talks about how a draft might look, there remain wide differences on other issues beyond Jewish-Arab relations, particularly the fraught question of the relationship between secular and religious Jews. There has been a harsh reaction to this ideological challenge. Yuval Diskin, head of the Shin Bet, was reported earlier this year as warning that a radicalisation of Israel&apos;s Arab minority was a &quot;strategic threat to the state&apos;s existence&quot;. In March, a rightwing MP introduced a bill in the Knesset that would in future require all MPs to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state and to its national anthem and flag. &quot;We have to do everything to keep Israel as a Jewish state,&quot; said Arnon Soffer, head of Geostrategy at Haifa University and a leading advocate of the argument that Arab Israelis and Palestinians constitute a &quot;demographic threat&quot; to the Jews. &quot;It is clear for me that to be a minority in this region is the end of the Jewish people, of the Jewish dream, of the Jewish state,&quot; he said. &quot;They use words like &apos;democracy&apos;, but if they are in power, it is the end of democracy. We have to stop being naive.&quot; Bishara is dismissive of those who argue that Arabs already have sufficient rights within Israel - notably citizenship, the right to vote and the right to speak out. These are no more than concessions, he says. &quot;You took the land and gave me freedom of speech,&quot; he says. &quot;Who&apos;s winning here? Let&apos;s revise the deal. Take your freedom of speech and give me back Palestine. How about that?&quot; The longer the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues, he says, Arab Israelis and Palestinians in the occupied territories will draw closer and the argument for a single, binational state will grow stronger, an argument that he openly favours. &quot;If it continues like this, in the end the issue of the Arabs in Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza will meet,&quot; he says. &quot;Binational means that the Arabs also should recognise that the Jews are a nationality. It doesn&apos;t mean the destruction of the state. It means two political entities will have to live together. It&apos;s a huge compromise.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-07-24T02:31:12Z", "title": "In a rare interview, Israeli MP Azmi Bishara talks to Rory McCarthy", "sentences": ["It wasn&apos;t the first inquiry into Bishara&apos;s activities, and so he was not surprised when six months later he was called in to Petah Tikva police station, near Tel Aviv, for questioning."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/24/israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "Middle East timeline", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Tony Blair flew into the Middle East yesterday for his first visit as a special international envoy, hoping to spark a fresh peace initiative at a time of long-stalled negotiations.

So far, of course, there have been no takers for either the fantasy break - illustrated by a pretty young woman only partly covered by a stylish hijab against a background of desert sands - or for the negotiations. Another poster in the series suggests spending a Jewish holiday visiting Roman ruins in neighbouring Syria. But today&apos;s visit to Jerusalem by two Arab foreign ministers is a timely reminder from the real world that there is a way to move towards peace in the Middle East. Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Abdulelah al-Khatib represent Egypt and Jordan, two of the three Arab countries which already have peace treaties with Israel (the third, Mauritania, is too small and remote to matter). But the visitors are representing the entire Arab League, whose 22 members all signed up to the Saudi initiative at last March&apos;s Riyadh summit. In it they called for peace with Israel as a &quot;strategic option&quot; - reiterating a call first made in Beirut in 2002, and a remarkable stance for an organisation that then included Saddam Hussein as well as Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad and the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy. Since the Saudi plan was re-endorsed, the Israeli government has made some positive noises but has refused to embrace the plan: the problem is less the Arab call for a return to the 1967 borders (maybe) than the demand for a &quot;just solution&quot; for Palestinian refugees (the key issue is whether they should be allowed to return not just to a future Palestinian state but to areas considered part of Israel since 1948). These are more than just details and go to the very heart of the world&apos;s most intractable conflict even though the experience of past negotiations suggests that both conditions should not be an insuperable barrier to starting talks - if the will was there to make them succeed. Still, there is real excitement in Jerusalem at today&apos;s Arab League mission - &quot;historic&quot; says the foreign ministry (though the Saudis and others refused to take part and there is some ambiguity about its precise terms of reference. Overblown or not, this is a vivid reminder of Israel&apos;s craving for some sort of acceptance in the Arab world. Thirty years on, it is hard to forget the enormous enthusiasm when Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem and addressed the Knesset, promising &quot;no more war&quot; in his first meeting with Menachem Begin. The Egyptian leader came &quot;with pyramids in his eyes and peace in his pipe&quot;, went a poignant Israeli song of the time. Sadat, handsomely paid by the US, settled in the end for the return of the Sinai desert, satisfying Egyptian honour if not Arab solidarity, leaving the Palestinians to reject an offer of limited autonomy (&quot;to collect garbage and exterminate mosquitoes&quot;, as they predictably scorned it). King Hussein of Jordan followed suit in 1994 after Yasser Arafat&apos;s Oslo agreement with Israel. It is hard today to imagine Assad or any other Arab leader doing the same while the Palestinian issue remains so dangerously unresolved, or Egypt and Jordan moving beyond their &quot;cold peace&quot; to encourage their citizens to visit the nightspots of Tel Aviv or see the desert bloom in the Negev.

Adam Resurrected, based on a darkly comic 1969 novel by popular Israeli author Yoram Kaniuk, tells the story of Adam Stein, a Jewish-German clown who is forced to entertain inmates in a Nazi concentration camp. His life is spared only because he plays his violin for the prisoners being sent to the gas chamber. Jeff Goldblum is to play the part of Adam, while Willem Dafoe will play the concentration camp commandant who forces him to act like a dog. Goldblum has described it as &apos;the most difficult role I have ever had to play&apos;. Directed by Paul Schrader, who is best known for his screenplay for Taxi Driver, and produced by the Israeli Ehud Bleiberg and the German Werner Wirsing, the harrowing film has been compared to Roberto Benigni&apos;s Oscar-winning Holocaust &apos;black comedy&apos; Life is Beautiful. One German critic wrote that Adam Resurrected was a &apos;risky tightrope walk which, if it is too funny, is in danger of mocking Holocaust survivors, if it is too serious, misrepresents the character of the book&apos;. Top German actors such as Moritz Bleibtreu and Veronica Ferres also have starring roles along with several Israeli household names such as Ayelet Zurer, who was in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Munich Much of Adam Resurrected is set in an asylum for Holocaust survivors in Israel&apos;s Negev desert where Stein is sent to recover from a nervous breakdown after he goes in search of his last surviving family member. To research the role Goldblum visited Israel and spoke to Holocaust survivors. He also spent time in Berlin. He also took violin lessons so he could properly portray his character. When Kaniuk published his novel in Israel it was a flop.

The handful of Hasidim that do stumble towards the distant throbbing, enveloped in large white prayer shawls and a divine distraction, promptly stumble away again when they reach the hedonism that lies before them. The lane between the small, old cottages is closed to traffic, pedestrianised by a hundred or more drunken ravers, who are being thrown about by the stinking cacophony of bass lines filling the street. A door leads into a studio apartment, the furniture replaced by another hundred or so people dancing to the same infected beat. Beer, rum and vodka generously add to the confusion. I stand outside chatting with Ravit, a Yemenite architect, whose grandmother was born a few blocks away in the first years of the 1900s. Looking up, Ravit laments the garish new skyscraper that has imposed itself on the low-rise region, a brash signal of things to come. So it is with developing cities everywhere - culture and beauty are frequently sacrificed for the sake of a quick penny, with regret typically featuring as a powerless afterthought. Looking back down, Ravit takes a pull on a joint and adamantly expounds on why Zionism equals racism, before telling me, with typical Israeli bravado, that Tel Aviv is the most dynamic place in the world. She exhales smoke and turns around to snog her girlfriend. Apparently that&apos;s the end of the conversation. Beside us dances an Ethiopian rasta in Goan getup, flitting about like he&apos;s groping for the light switch. Some poor guy next to me whips out a recorder and begins to play, oblivious to my amusement. In this country, it seems, recorders are not just for children under the age of seven. Liquid suddenly hits me square on the head, which, judging by the cleanliness of the party is not a welcome sign, but I turn to see some kind of giant Iraqi with a water pistol, now squirting the small blonde kid running bare-footed through the melee. This, it turns out, is the child&apos;s home - his dad and pregnant mother, the hosts. As the day blackened and the Tel Aviv skyscrapers lit up along the sea front, the narrow lane closed in on us and the party continued - appalling dancing made up for by the fact that there was not an angry face to be seen. People were even pleased to see one another and at no point did I witness a short bloke seeking a fight. I had to wonder just what it was about London that made this bonhomie so remarkable to me. The drinks flowed from a makeshift bar beside the speakers and friends and strangers came and went. The neighbouring houses opened up and their owners came to dance, while the kids sat with their parents&apos; friends, thrilled to be up so late. A couple of guys walked past holding hands, as an American guy screamed above the bass to tell me how much he loves Bethnal Green. His friend agreed, &quot;But there&apos;s something about Tel Aviv,&quot; he added. He had a point. And it&apos;s a something that people outside Israel don&apos;t hear enough about, because, quite simply, it doesn&apos;t fit into the clear opposition of black and white, right and wrong that absolves people from thinking too deeply. Plus it gives character and life to a people whom it is far easier to condemn. In short, it is awkward to admit that Israel is alive. But if America and Britain are allowed to have colour, despite their occupation and destruction of Iraq, and if Germany and Italy are permitted complexity despite what they did 60 years ago - which, of course, they should be - then Israel should be recognised as embodying a similar multiplicity of meaning, its various elements seen as an organic, vital being, rather than as a two-dimensional machine. Nevertheless, as the police cars came to break up the party after a hard day&apos;s night of partying, and Israel&apos;s various punters, ravers and guests made their many ways home, there was little concern over what the outside world thought. After all, these people didn&apos;t need the world to tell them what the occupation means; they didn&apos;t need them to tell them about Palestine, and they certainly didn&apos;t need to have their own country explained to them. They were here, living it, in real flesh, blood and time. And save for a catastrophe, they&apos;ll be living it here again next week, just like they would in any other city, in any other country in the world.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-29T12:00:00Z", "title": "Behind the headlines", "sentences": ["It is Shabbat afternoon, but the narrow lanes of Tel Aviv&apos;s artists&apos; quarter, Neve Tzedek, are throbbing with Israeli-grown trance; the unholiest of street parties in the most unholy of cities.", "Looking back down, Ravit takes a pull on a joint and adamantly expounds on why Zionism equals racism, before telling me, with typical Israeli bravado, that Tel Aviv is the most dynamic place in the world.", "As the day blackened and the Tel Aviv skyscrapers lit up along the sea front, the narrow lane closed in on us and the party continued - appalling dancing made up for by the fact that there was not an angry face to be seen.", "His friend agreed, &quot;But there&apos;s something about Tel Aviv,&quot; he added."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/29/behindtheheadlines"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Over the past five years the Israeli peace camp has dwindled. Last month marked the occupation&apos;s 40th anniversary, and no more than 4,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv to protest against Israel&apos;s longstanding military rule. Of the demonstrators who did show up, only a few hundred are what one could call ardent activists - people who have dedicated their life to peace and justice Among the most committed of these are Israel&apos;s anarchists. Yet, over the past two years they have been under attack, and it is becoming more and more difficult for them to continue their struggle. Established in 2003, the anarchists are made up of young Israelis, mostly in their twenties, who work closely with the Palestinian popular village committees in order to resist Israel&apos;s occupation. They have no official leaders, no office, and no paid staff, and yet they have managed to accomplish more than many well-oiled NGOs and social movements. They are perhaps best known for their efforts in the small village of Bil&apos;in, where for more than two years weekly demonstrations have been staged against the wall that Israel is building on Palestinian land. The anarchists are active in numerous other villages and towns as well. Day in and day out, they travel in small groups through the West Bank, supporting non-violent direct action that helps Palestinian farmers gain access to their fields and crops, while opposing the construction of the separation barrier and the confiscation of occupied land. One of the most remarkable qualities of these young Israelis is their subversive use of their own privilege, employing it not for self-interested social, economic or political gain - as most people do - but rather in order to stand up to power. The anarchists, in other words, exploit the privilege that comes with their Jewish identity and use it as a strategic asset against the brutal policies of the Jewish state. As Jewish activists they are well aware that the Israeli military behaves very differently when Israeli Jews are present during a protest in the West Bank and that the level of violence, while still severe, is much less intense. Indeed, according to Israeli soldiers the military has more stringent open fire regulations for demonstrations in which non-Palestinians participate. So when a village&apos;s public committee decides to carry out non-violent protests against the occupying power, the anarchists mingle with the demonstrating villagers, thus becoming a human shield for all of those Palestinians who have chosen to follow the path of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Even though the anarchists are frequently beaten and arrested, they do not desist. To date, about 10 Palestinians have been killed in demonstrations against the separation barrier and thousands have been wounded, a number that would no doubt have been much greater had it not been for the fearless dedication of the anarchists. These unsung heroes are currently regarded in Israel as a fifth column. And when the Israeli police began to realise that beating and detaining them would not stop their stubborn resistance, a different strategy was adopted. Scores of legal indictments were issued by the state prosecutor. The anarchists took this as a new challenge. They have launched a legal campaign, whose aim is to defend the basic civil right of all Israelis to resist their government&apos;s rights-abusive policies. Leading this battle is Gabi Lasky, an energetic lawyer, who spends many of her weekends releasing anarchists from detention and her weekdays representing them in court. Unlike the struggle inside the Occupied Territories, the legal battle to protect civil liberties requires financial resources, which the anarchists do not have. The state knows this is the anarchists&apos; Achilles heel and has been trying to undermine their peace-building activities by making them pay hefty legal fees. Although Lasky is working for little more than minimum wage, the anarchists&apos; struggle cannot be sustained without help from concerned individuals around the world.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-30T08:00:00Z", "title": "Anarchists under fire", "sentences": ["Last month marked the occupation&apos;s 40th anniversary, and no more than 4,000 people gathered in Tel Aviv to protest against Israel&apos;s longstanding military rule."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/30/anarchistsunderfire"}, {"tags": ["UK news", "US news", "World news", "Poland", "Europe"], "article": "The British political class loves to talk of the special relationship between the US and Britain based on the &quot;common values&quot; the two countries share. But cross the Atlantic and you&apos;ll hear very little said of this &quot;special relationship&quot;. As Victor Bulmer-Thomas, former Chatham House director, puts it, &quot;The bilateral relationship with the United States may be &apos;special&apos; to Britain, but the US has never described it as more than &apos;close&apos;.&quot; No doubt, Britain is an important ally of the US. But it is by no means the sole, weightiest, or closest of the many allies the US has across the world in Europe, Asia, or the Middle East. Currently, the US is busy forging a strong alliance with India that includes close nuclear cooperation, as part of a longer-term containment strategy toward China, aimed at checking its growing influence in Asia. In Europe, it is tightening its relations with former communist states, with plans to build a radar system in the Czech Republic and a bank of interceptor rocket missiles in Poland. These two countries, like others in eastern - or new - Europe, have become crucial for the American project of Nato enlargement, largely aimed at encircling Russia. Here lies one of the principal causes of the continuing deterioration in relations between Russia and the US - and consequently Britain. Neither does Britain&apos;s relation to the US compare with what binds the latter to Israel. Unlike the UK, Israel is not only a functional ally at the service of the US. It is a definer of its policies in the region, on whom Washington lavishes all kinds of support, financial, military and political. The strength of these ties is such that Washington has been prepared to risk its relations with the region as a whole, governments and nations, for Tel Aviv&apos;s sake. If any relation qualifies for the title of &quot;special&quot;, surely this one does. Political language is not neutral or transparent. What it conceals tends to be greater than what it reveals. Talk of &quot;values we share with the US&quot; is no exception. Britain is an ally of the US - albeit not its closest, or most important, but this has little to do with culture, and much to do with power balances and geo-political interests. In the aftermath of the second world war, these &quot;common values&quot; our politicians incessantly blather about did not stop the US seeking to dismantle Britain&apos;s imperial inheritance, marginalise its influence and occupy the position it had long held on the international stage. Neither did they prevent the Eisenhower administration forcing a ceasefire on Britain during its war on Nasser&apos;s Egypt in 1956. Dealing a deadly blow to Britain&apos;s dominance in the region, the US demanded that the invasion stop, sponsored resolutions in the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and threatened to precipitate the collapse of the pound by selling its reserves of the currency. Humiliated, Britain withdrew in the space of a week, Eden resigned from office, and America emerged as the principal player in the Middle East. And today, after years of good service, Blair has failed to convince the Bush administration to broaden his job description to include mediation between Israelis and Palestinians. Instead of a Middle East envoy empowered to negotiate a peace agreement as he had hoped, Blair&apos;s mandate was trimmed to helping &quot;build the economy and the state institutions&quot; of a non-existing state. Blair, the &quot;special friend&quot;, had no choice but to accept his humble post and its modest funding derived not from the US, but largely from the EU. In international politics, as he is coming to learn the hard way, loyalty counts for very little. It is time that we shook off the myth that what binds Britain to the US is the lofty values the two share. After all, culturally America is no closer to the UK than Ireland, New Zealand, or Sweden. The truth, unpalatable as it may be, is that since the second world war, Britain has had to swallow its pride and accept that the sun had set on the empire where it never sets, and that it now shone on the other side of the Atlantic. Thus was born the lie of &quot;the special relationship&quot;. Pragmatic old Britain resigned itself to the new &quot;politics of regress&quot;. If it can&apos;t beat the new big boys on the field, it might as well join them. It may not do the dividing, but it will do all it can to have a slice of the cake. That&apos;s all very well when the going is good. The trouble for the UK, however, is that this strategy no longer yields benefits and an easy share of the spoils. Today, it has turned into a growing burden on Britain&apos;s interests, damaging its international standing, overstretching its military capabilities and devouring the lives and limbs of its soldiers. The cost of the &quot;special&quot; relationship escalates with every American crisis on the ground, with the bloodbath in Iraq and insurgency in Afghanistan, as well as with the growth in public resentment towards the US and decline in its &quot;soft power&quot;. As America sinks into the quagmire, Britain inevitably follows suit. The price of this &quot;unique&quot; alliance is such that in countless angry protests across the world, the union flag is being burnt alongside the stars and stripes. And if the US is a superpower, capable of absorbing its shocks, the same is sadly not true of the UK. It is an ageing power that can take few more strikes or blows, try to delude itself with the &quot;special relationship&quot; myth as it may.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-01T10:00:00Z", "title": "The special relationship myth", "sentences": ["The strength of these ties is such that Washington has been prepared to risk its relations with the region as a whole, governments and nations, for Tel Aviv&apos;s sake."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/01/thespecialrelationshipmyth"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Airline industry", "Heathrow airport"], "article": "Recent reports claim that UK airport security is even slower than Israel&apos;s. Stop complaining and get used to it, says Toby Greene  Is this really necessary? ... people queue to check in at Heathrow airport. Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PA International air travel involves standing in lines, for ages. Everyone knows that. Everyone except British passengers who are up in arms about having to wait as many as 20 minutes for a security check at Heathrow airport. &quot;Twenty minutes,&quot; they cry. &quot;Just to check I&apos;m not an international terrorist? Is this really necessary?&quot; Personally, I&apos;m happy to wait as long as 25 or even 30 minutes for the peace of mind of knowing the person I&apos;m sitting next to isn&apos;t a knife-wielding maniac.  Recent reports of unacceptable security delays at UK airports have drawn unfavourable comparisons with Israel&apos;s main international airport, Ben Gurion, where passenger screening is famously rigid. In truth, visitors to Ben Gurion know that, though queuing for security can be expected, the airport is so well stocked with duty-free that it is well worth the wait. Most will turn up early just to have more time browsing the flat-screen TVs, or to indulge in one of the world&apos;s very few kosher McDonalds. But, before getting to the fun of the departure lounge, everyone flying from Tel Aviv will get the full on cross-examination from airport security staff. Questions such as, &quot;Does the luggage belong to you?&quot;; &quot;Have you been with your bags the whole time?&quot;; and &quot;Has anyone given you anything to take on the flight?&quot; may sound standard, but in Israel, they tend to take a more intense approach to security.  Take my advice, if your auntie Myrna gave you a wedding present to pass on to your cousin Danny, don&apos;t mention it to the security staff. They will want to know how long you have known your aunt, her full name and address, if she is of sound mind, whether she has ever shown tendencies to violence or has any rudimentary knowledge of explosives. And that starts you thinking. Lets face it, how well do you really know your auntie Myrna? Your mother always told you that side of the family was a bit eccentric. By the time you&apos;re finished, the security guard will have you convinced that you are an unwitting mule for a demonic terrorist plot, and you are genuinely amazed that they let you on the flight at all. But after you&apos;ve been through the grinder a few times, you come to accept that it is all part of the Israel experience. When they ask you if you are carrying a weapon, the main thing to remember is not to attempt, however strong the urge, to crack a joke. They will not be amused - even if it&apos;s funny. Unlike at Heathrow, there are no special restrictions on carrying liquids on to flights from Ben Gurion. It does seem confusing that an airport should confiscate your plastic bottle of water and your nail scissors as you go through passport control, and then entice you to buy glass bottles of highly flammable liquid at &quot;Three for the price of two&quot; once you are in the departure lounge. Couldn&apos;t the duty free bottle of Vodka be a sharp implement and an explosive liquid all rolled into one? And it is this kind of apparent inconsistency, and a general lack of trust in the airlines, that probably contributes to the sense of dissatisfaction at Heathrow and other UK airports. That and the impatience of the average tourist who can already smell their first sangria. Most passengers at Ben Gurion are no more patient than the Brits, but they put up with the security checks because they know that the procedure is proven to be effective and they trust that their flight is going to be safe. Everyone else had better get used to it, because the threat is not going away, and neither will the queuing.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-01T14:05:00Z", "title": "Why airport queues are here to stay", "sentences": ["But, before getting to the fun of the departure lounge, everyone flying from Tel Aviv will get the full on cross-examination from airport security staff."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2007/aug/01/whyairportqueuesarehereto"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "For decades, Israel&apos;s heroes were its soldiers and pioneers who fought to build and protect the state, but now its cultural icons are models and singers likely to have dodged military service. The new trend was graphically demonstrated last week when it emerged that five out of eight contestants in A Star is Born, a talent contest on the lines of Pop Idol, had not served in the army. In Israel, military service for men and women is compulsory, but increasing numbers of young people are opting out by claiming to be religious or feigning mental illness. Recent figures revealed that 43 per cent of women and 25 per cent of men do not perform their military service, which lasts three years for men and two years for women. Some of Israel&apos;s biggest celebrities have never served in the forces, such as the model Bar Refaeli, girlfriend of Leonardo diCaprio, and Avi Geffen, a pop star. Earlier this year, the Israeli Chelsea footballer, Ben Sahar, was exempted from national service to pursue his career. The new trend has led to a chorus of disapproval from Israeli leaders, who see the army as the essence of Israeli society. Ehud Barak, the defence minister and former prime minister, said last week that he intended to try to end draft-dodging. &apos;I will act to reduce draft dodging. As a society, we must not turn draftdodgers into heroes,&apos; he said. Israel&apos;s military strength is based on the theory that it can react to any threat by mobilising the entire country. Male soldiers continue to perform annual reserve duty until they are 45. Barak, like many Israeli politicians, served in the army all his life, rising to chief of staff before entering politics. &apos;From the people&apos;s army, the IDF is gradually turning into the army of half the people. When he goes into battle, a soldier should not have to feel that a portion of our society regards him as a sucker. A soldier cannot charge forward with all his might if he feels that the home front is not unreservedly behind him A society that lives under existential threat will survive only if it is able to respect those who defend it,&apos; he said. Two major sections of Israeli society are exempt from military service - Arab Israelis and ultra-orthodox Jews. Ultra-orthodox Jews are exempt because their profession is the study of Torah. On Friday, a small group of marchers demonstrated in Tel Aviv for new laws that would make draft-dodging more difficult. Miri Brown, a member of the Forum of Parents for Equally Sharing the Military Burden, said that it was vital that all Israelis performed some kind of compulsory service. &apos;We don&apos;t want two societies. We want people to share the burden, either militarily, or through civil service. We are all in the same society, and there need to be equal rights and duties,&apos; said told Ynet, an Israeli news website. Among the marchers was actor Shlomo Vishinski, whose son was killed last year in Lebanon while serving in the IDF. &apos;The country boasts something it doesn&apos;t have, saying the draft is mandatory,&apos; he said. &apos;Those who can&apos;t accept orders aren&apos;t responsible enough to drive a car either. That is a responsibility, too. Those who don&apos;t enlist should have their licence taken away.&apos; At the same time in Tel Aviv&apos;s Sheinkin Street, thousands of young Israelis were shopping and drinking coffee in the city&apos;s most fashionable thoroughfare. Over a period of two hours, only two soldiers could be seen in uniform, both women, a novelty for Israel, where soldiers returning home for the weekend can be seen everywhere. In spite of what Barak said, it was difficult to find young people who wanted to avoid military service, though few were interested in joining combat units. Amit Ben Israel, 15, said that he wanted to serve in the information technology or intelligence sector of the army. &apos;Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I want do my military service because it&apos;s a service to my country. I have been protected by others up to now and I want to do the same when I am 18,&apos; he said. Ilit, 23, said she had just finished her service in the intelligence corps and felt that military service was an essential component of being an Israeli. &apos;One of my friends did not serve because she did not see the point in it. It does bother me that so many celebrities did not serve because children look up to them and emulate them,&apos; she said. Roi Adar, 27, also of the intelligence corps, said that Ben Sahar&apos;s exemption from military service was acceptable, but felt that other celebrities were a disgrace to their country.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-05T00:25:56Z", "title": "Israelis are up in arms at celebrity draft dodgers", "sentences": ["On Friday, a small group of marchers demonstrated in Tel Aviv for new laws that would make draft-dodging more difficult.", "Those who don&apos;t enlist should have their licence taken away.&apos; At the same time in Tel Aviv&apos;s Sheinkin Street, thousands of young Israelis were shopping and drinking coffee in the city&apos;s most fashionable thoroughfare."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/05/israel"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "It is appalling, if unsurprising, to read the neoconservative cheerleader Oliver Kamm arguing in these pages that the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki 62 years ago saved lives and ended suffering. The same camp whose vocal endorsement led to the present catastrophe in Iraq are now hawkishly gazing at Iran. The same absurd and dangerous logic that defends the nuclear atrocities of 1945 can now be used to support the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons against Iran - the threat of which in turn makes the idea of a conventional attack appear more palatable. Now, more than ever, we should be unequivocal in our moral position: as Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has said, the mere possession of nuclear weapons today should be viewed with the same condemnation and horror as we have regarded slavery and genocide in our modern civilized world. Astonishingly, the calamity of Iraq has failed to dampen the belligerent clique within the White House. The arrival of an IAEA team in Tehran yesterday to discuss inspections is equally unlikely to dissuade advocates of a strike, nuclear or conventional. Such an assault would be in flagrant breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but it would hardly be the first time the US has disregarded the 1968 accord. The treaty obliges nuclear states to pursue negotiations in good faith towards cessation of the nuclear arms race and on to disarmament. It also guarantees non-nuclear states help with and access to peaceful nuclear know-how and technology. All five original nuclear states are in violation of the treaty for failing to take effective action towards disarmament. The US systematically contravened the treaty in the 1980s and 1990s by successfully bringing pressure to bear on western governments and companies, as well as China and Russia, not to enter nuclear collaborations with Iran - which, as a signatory of the treaty, has been entitled since 1970 to receive material, technology and information for the peaceful use of nuclear power. This eventually drove Iran, after the bombing of Iraq&apos;s Osirak nuclear plant by Israel in 1981, on to the black market in order to pursue its nuclear programme. The subsequent partial concealment of Iran&apos;s nuclear activities gave rise to western suspicion of its nuclear ambitions, but rarely does the media characterisation make reference to the context in which the recourse to the black market took place. It is rare, too, to see mention made of the fact that the IAEA has found no evidence of a weapons programme after over 2,200 hours of snap inspections of Iranian nuclear plants. In marked contrast to western suspicion of Iran, the real nuclear programme in Israel has been eagerly sponsored by the governments of France, Britain and the US. They have actively supported Israel&apos;s development of an arsenal estimated to include more than 200 warheads. It is a weapons programme Tel Aviv is determined to shroud in secrecy. Mordechai Vanunu served an 18-year prison sentence, including 12 years in solitary confinement, after speaking publicly of Israel&apos;s possession of nuclear weapons in 1986. Last month he was sentenced to a further six months in prison for speaking to foreigners . Even as Iran discusses renewed inspections with the IAEA, the risk of a military attack on its nuclear facilities remains high. Israel&apos;s threat to deploy nuclear bunker busters to destroy Iran&apos;s weapons potential is in line with the US&apos;s national security strategy of 2006 and the Pentagon&apos;s doctrine for joint nuclear operations which justifies use of tactical nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states as a &quot;deterrent&quot;. The ultimate irony is that the leading violator of the treaty, the US, and the region&apos;s sole nuclear power and non-signatory, Israel, are contemplating nuclear strikes on the pretext of nuclear limitation. Last year John McCain, a Republican presidential hopeful and an advocate of keeping the military option against Iran on the table, was asked what the consequence of an attack on Iran would be. His response was only one word: &quot;Armageddon.&quot; After three devastating wars driven by the US, Britain and Israel since 9/11, the prospect of a catastrophic war against Iran hangs over the region. While the world remembers Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an international statement endorsed by dozens of leading peace, anti-nuclear and community organisations in the UK, US and Israel, as well as five Nobel laureates, calls for a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction. Israel could do the region a great service by announcing immediately that it is to disable its nuclear arsenal. \u00b7 Abbas Edalat is professor of computer science and mathematics at Imperial College London and founder of the Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran; Mehrnaz Shahabi is the campaign&apos;s executive editor www.campaigniran.org \u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2011.

This provided him with enough anecdotes to ghost four books for the comic, including his autobiography, Don&apos;t Shoot, It&apos;s Only Me (1990), and to produce his own account of the first trip by an American comedian to the Soviet Union. He wrote, produced and directed a string of Hope movies and films for Doris Day, Sophia Loren, Cary Grant, Lucille Ball and Danny Kaye, and worked for all the studio moguls. The 1950s were good times for making movies. Shavelson was a busy man when the studios were each turning out up to 52 films a year - and he was still writing, producing and directing after the system had radically altered. He liked to adopt a sports metaphor to describe the changing scene in Los Angeles - &quot;There used to be Giants in this town,&quot; he said. &quot;Now all we have are the Dodgers.&quot; Other giants who worked with him included Frank Sinatra, Groucho Marx, Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Kirk Douglas. Shavelson was born in Brooklyn, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, and worked at his father&apos;s general store. He was educated at Cornell University, and early writing for American radio led to him meeting Hope, who recruited him for his &quot;joke factory&quot;. Hope&apos;s demands made them hard times for a writer - and never more so than on his first day. &quot;It was Billy Wilder&apos;s The Apartment come to life,&quot; he told me once. &quot;I had rented an apartment that very morning. Bob said to me, &apos;Have you got somewhere to live?&apos; I said, &apos;Yes&apos;. &apos;Are you married or living with someone?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; &apos;Good,&apos; he said, &apos;leave the key under the mat. It&apos;ll be waiting for you at midnight.&apos; When I got back home, I could see the marks of two sets of feet leading from the bed to the shower - and another two sets in the opposite direction.&quot; But it was the beginning of a good training period for Shavelson. He wrote his radio scripts when Hope entertained the troops during the second world war and was still doing so into the 1950s. By then, he had become head of the team and started writing Hope&apos;s movies. The first, in 1944, was The Princess and the Pirate for Sam Goldwyn. Five years later he wrote two Hope films, The Great Lover and the Damon Runyon story, Sorrowful Jones. In 1955 he wrote for and directed Hope in The Seven Little Foys - the story of the American vaudevillian who took his seven children on to the stage when his wife left him. James Cagney was also in the film, for which Shavelson was nominated for a screenplay Oscar. Two years later, Shavelson fulfilled the same roles for Hope&apos;s other biographical venture Beau James, based on the life of New York&apos;s colourful Mayor, Jimmy Walker. By that time, he had cemented a similar relationship with Danny Kaye and wrote two of the early Kaye classics, Wonder Man and The Kid from Brooklyn, which he said he worked on &quot;as a kid from Brooklyn myself&quot;. In 1959, he directed and wrote (with his frequent partner Jack Rose, who was producer) Kaye&apos;s The Five Pennies, the story of the trumpeter Red Nichols. The most famous scene in that movie was Shavelson&apos;s own idea - teaming Kaye (miming to Nichols&apos; actual trumpet playing) and Louis Armstrong in their duet of When the Saints Go Marching In and he was writer-director for Kaye&apos;s On the Double two years later . He wrote some of Doris Day&apos;s earliest movies, including On Moonlight Bay and I&apos;ll See You In My Dreams in 1951 and April in Paris in 1952. In between he wrote one of the last films to star Groucho Marx, Double Dynamite, which also featured Frank Sinatra, with whom he built up a long friendship. There was great variety in his work. In 1958 he wrote Houseboat for Sophia Loren and Cary Grant, for which he was again Oscar-nominated. Two years later he worked with Loren again on It Started in Naples, with Clark Gable. (Two decades later, he wrote a novel , Lualda, a racy piece about the love of a film producer for an Italian femme fatale, born in Naples. He never denied that he had Loren in mind.) He made a romantic comedy, A New Kind of Love, with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in 1963. In 1966, Sinatra asked to be included in the cast of Shavelson&apos;s most significant movie, Cast a Giant Shadow, shot in Israel about the country&apos;s war of independence, which Shavelson wrote, produced and directed. Starring Kirk Douglas, John Wayne, Yul Brynner and Angie Dickinson, it had Sinatra in a minor role. The star paid his own expenses to ensure that he would be &quot;allowed&quot; to play the part. His antics during filming - like breaking off from the dedication of a youth centre both he and Shavelson were attending because he had found a couple of girls in Tel Aviv - formed a large part of the bestselling book Shavelson wrote about the making of the picture, How to Make a Jewish Movie (1971). His most successful box-office venture was Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, but perhaps his best movie, which he wrote, produced and directed was The War Between Men and Women (1972), based on a James Thurber story, with Jack Lemmon and Barbara Harris. He claimed that his favourite feature film was his last, Mixed Company (1974), a baseball story that he also wrote, directed and produced. The most successful of his TV mini-series, Ike, the War Years, was based on the memoirs of Kay Summersby, General Eisenhower&apos;s driver, with Lee Remick and Robert Duval. He continued to write books, including an autobiography released on his 90th birthday this year - How to Succeed in Hollywood Without Really Trying: PS - You Can&apos;t!. His first wife, Lucille, to whom he had been married for more than 60 years, died in 2000. He is survived by their son and a daughter, and his second wife Ruth.  \u00b7 Melville Shavelson, writer, producer and director, born April 1 1917; died August 8 2007", "publicationDate": "2007-08-09T23:20:17Z", "title": "Obituary: Melville Shavelson", "sentences": ["His antics during filming - like breaking off from the dedication of a youth centre both he and Shavelson were attending because he had found a couple of girls in Tel Aviv - formed a large part of the bestselling book Shavelson wrote about the making of the picture, How to Make a Jewish Movie (1971)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries1"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "A flurry of diplomatic activity has in recent weeks renewed hope of an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Yesterday, Mike Gapes MP suggested in these pages that those efforts should include Hamas. Gapes, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, is held in highest esteem by Israelis and Palestinians alike for his efforts to foster reconciliation in our region. But by calling for dialogue with extremists, he risks damaging the peace process just as a few green shoots are beginning to show. I can only suppose that, like the rest of us, he is frustrated by the lack of substantial progress towards our common goal: an independent Palestinian state existing peacefully side by side with Israel. But following Hamas&apos;s coup in Gaza, a window of opportunity has opened for the formation of a new moderate Palestinian government. If we can build on this momentum, the regional summit planned for this autumn could bring real results. In the Palestinian president, Fatah&apos;s Mahmoud Abbas, we believe we have found a partner who can fulfill the national aspirations of the Palestinian people and deliver a meaningful peace. Contrast this with Hamas, which, despite its public relations successes, remains an extremist group motivated by a murderous ideology, using violent and criminal means to meet its ends. Abbas himself has described Hamas members as terrorists, ruling out direct talks following the bloody coup in Gaza. Any attempt to do differently will undermine him, damaging both his ability to negotiate and to govern. After the disengagement from Gaza, it was Hamas that terrorised Israeli civilians with a near-constant barrage of rockets fired from the very areas Israel had returned to Palestinian control. The world has seen the terrible damage that these attacks can do to everyday life in a small town like Sderot. Now Hamas has its sights set on the West Bank. What rockets fired from there could do to Tel Aviv, only a few miles inside the Green Line, does not bear thinking about. Abbas and his prime minister Salam Fayad have the chance to show their people what a future Palestinian state could look like: peaceful, prosperous and democratic. Of course, Israel&apos;s expectations of Abbas are not unrealistic. We do not expect him to achieve change overnight. But should the West Bank fall into the hands of the extremists, ordinary Palestinians and Israelis alike will be the ones who suffer. In order to prevent this happening, Israel&apos;s prime minister has proved himself willing to take courageous steps. The first Israeli premier to visit the Palestinian Authority since the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, he took a personal risk in his meeting with Abbas last week to deliver the message that Israel is committed to helping the Palestinians build a viable and durable state. We should not lose sight of the importance of this change. And Ehud Olmert brought far more than just words to Jericho. Israel has put its money where its mouth is, releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and freeing huge sums in revenues. Now it is up to Abbas to provide the reassurances that will allow Israel to go further in easing restrictions on the West Bank. He bears a heavy burden of responsibility. But with the backing of the international community, he can succeed. The international community has a moral duty to support those who would bring peace and deny succour to those who would make war. We must continue to make clear to all the Palestinian factions that political progress cannot be achieved through violence. Britain has a proud history of opposing extremism.

Time after time the pet was cited as reason for denying us entry, and it took us a good half hour till we found an employee sympathetic enough to turn a blind eye to our four-legged companion. At the time, we mused that this must be how it felt to be a Palestinian turned away from buses, cafes and malls for security reasons - and so it seemed last night, when I saw first-hand that exact scenario play itself out at the Tel Aviv bus station. It was nearly 11 o&apos;clock, and nine of us were sitting on a sherut, waiting for one more passenger to arrive and fill the last seat so that we could set off up the motorway to Jerusalem. After nearly a quarter of an hour&apos;s delay, to our relief a middle-aged man finally strode up and clambered aboard, and we looked expectantly at the driver hoping that we could at last get going on our journey home. But he had other ideas, and beckoned for the new arrival to come forward and present his papers for inspection - as though the driver himself was some kind of de facto border policeman. Muttering angrily to himself, the wanted man pushed his way to the front of the van, thrusting his documents into the driver&apos;s hands, though his blue ID card was conspicuous by its absence. Pouncing on the lack of legitimate paperwork, the driver ordered the man to alight immediately, causing an almighty row to erupt between the two of them, as well as most of the other passengers on the bus. A driver of another minibus joined the fray at this point, declaring that he&apos;d ridden with this particular Palestinian many times and that he was legally allowed to be in Israel, regardless of his having not brought his ID with him. That wasn&apos;t enough for our by-now furious driver, who switched to Arabic and let fly with a torrent of abuse at both the Palestinian and his supporter, both of whom eventually backed down and walked away defeated. Another, more legitimate, passenger soon arrived and we drove off, the departed Palestinian gone - but not forgotten. Two men behind me continued debating the driver&apos;s actions long into the journey, vehemently accusing each other of ignorance and heartlessness when it came to what should have been done to remedy the situation. In the red corner was a burly man who, apparently, was &quot;deeply hurt to see the driver have to throw the man off - but he did what he had to do&quot;. His assertion was born out of experience, it turned out. &quot;I drive a truck, and once picked up a Palestinian hitchhiker who was still with me when we arrived at a checkpoint. The soldiers found he didn&apos;t have Israeli papers, and not only arrested him, but hit me with a 1,000 shekel fine as well.&quot; His lorry was impounded for a month, he said, until he paid the fine - &quot;and that&apos;s exactly what would happen here if the driver had taken that man and got caught&quot;. As the man next to him shook his head in disagreement, the truck driver asked him: &quot;Why should the driver&apos;s wife and kids suffer, just so that your Palestinian friend gets home quicker?&quot; &quot;What about the Palestinian&apos;s wife and kids?&quot;, replied his opponent. &quot;And anyway, it&apos;s not as though the man even had a bag with him, so he couldn&apos;t have been carrying anything dangerous.&quot; As I sat quietly listening to their argument rage on, what struck me most was how totally the conflict has penetrated even the most mundane activities such as boarding a bus, and how hard it is for the average Israeli to come to terms with the constant threat of terror in every public arena. I am often accused on the threads of not articulating the fears of the Israeli man on the street - and last night&apos;s scene was a perfect example of how intensely the ordinary Israelis feel the shadow of danger. At the care home where I volunteer, the head social worker implored me to get the message across that she, &quot;like the majority of the population&quot;, still feels the fear and anxiety every time she gets on a bus and finds herself instincitively casting an apprehensive eye over her fellow passengers, to reassure herself that none of them is a terrorist wolf in civilian sheep&apos;s clothing. &quot;I&apos;m still too frightened to go to the Old City [of Jerusalem]&quot;, she told me, &quot;and even in the malls and cafes I&apos;m still on edge&quot;. Granted, the IDF and government often utilise the media to good effect to stoke up public fear, in order to justify their continued policies of subjugation and heavy-handed security measures, but at the same time the public has good reason to be cautious. They have long memories, and the scars of the last intifada are still fresh in many people&apos;s minds. What was so instructive about the minibus incident was not the fact that the Palestinian man was ejected from the bus - after all, the driver had every right not to break the law, and acted well within his remit to refuse entry to an illegal passenger. More eye-opening was the fact that so many people on the bus cared enough about the situation to argue the toss between themselves for the next half hour, demonstrating quite how deeply the conflict has embedded itself in the public&apos;s consciousness. No one enjoyed seeing the Palestinian man&apos;s humiliation - that much was clear. But the fact that the driver&apos;s actions were not met with unanimous outcry from the passengers showed that the shadow of terror still looms large over the average Israeli. The public&apos;s fear of attack still trumps all other emotions - and to dismiss their trepidation is to do them a massive injustice. In my last piece, I complained about the cruelty of some soldiers on checkpoint duty - but never suggested for one minute that the checkpoints themselves be dismantled. For all that there is much wrong with the behaviour of elements of the IDF and security forces, the underlying necessity for tight security is indisputable. Anyone who thinks differently only needs pay heed to the daily streams of murderous rhetoric from the extremist groups on the other side of the security wall. Israelis do - which is why they view incidents such as last night&apos;s as terribly painful, but totally justifiable.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-16T06:00:00Z", "title": "Driven towards injustice", "sentences": ["Last year, a friend and I tried in vain to convince driver after driver to allow us to board their sherutim (minibuses) from Tel Aviv to Haifa with a dog in tow.", "At the time, we mused that this must be how it felt to be a Palestinian turned away from buses, cafes and malls for security reasons - and so it seemed last night, when I saw first-hand that exact scenario play itself out at the Tel Aviv bus station."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/16/driventowardsinjustice"}, {"tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2007", "Theatre", "Stage", "Festivals", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival"], "article": "David Rees&apos; sly internet comic strip, Get Your War On (Assembly @Aurora Nova), is niftily animated in Rude Mechs&apos; 70-minute agitprop-style show, which skims over events from the period immediately after 9/11, when the US is &quot;supersizing its grief&quot;, to the bombing of Afghanistan and the current mess in Iraq.

The Kommersant newspaper said the plans were a long way from implementation. Analysts believe that given its still-depleted resources, the Russian navy would have difficulty extending operations to the Mediterranean, even with help from its northern and Baltic fleets as envisaged by Admiral Masorin. But as the Kyiv Post noted, the Russian Black Sea fleet&apos;s lease on its Sevastopol base is hostage to Ukraine&apos;s volatile relations with Moscow - and will in any case expire in 2017, necessitating a renegotiation or a move to new quarters. Wary of Israel&apos;s possible reaction, Syria denies it has any intention of hosting a new Russian military presence. But in the murky world of Middle East politics, such statements are not taken at face value. Syria&apos;s previous collaboration and arms purchases from Moscow, and the two countries&apos; common friendship with Iran, are taken as evidence that a new base agreement could be a logical step at some stage. On some readings, Damascus could threaten to give a go-ahead to the Russians if its increased cooperation with the US over Iraq fails to extract concessions on Lebanon or desired guarantees that Washington will not pursue regime change. President Vladimir Putin, involved in a bare-chested global game of military and diplomatic one-upmanship with the US, may also be using the Syrian naval bases as pawns.

Psychology News Press \u00a39.99, pp192 The 33-Day War by Gilbert Achcar and Michel Warschawski. Saqi Books \u00a312.99, pp136 Annette Levy Willard, a senior reporter with the French newspaper Liberation, kept a diary of life in Israel during last summer&apos;s month-long conflict with the Hizbollah militia of Lebanon. The result, Summer Rain, is an immediate and intimate portrait of a tiny country at war: militarily mighty, hated and feared by its neighbours and living in a permanent state of fear itself. On 12 July 2006, Hizbollah, whose members operate a &apos;state within a state&apos; in south Lebanon, fired rockets into kibbutzim over the border while their fighters sneaked into Israel, killed three soldiers and kidnapped two others, expecting to then trade prisoners with Israel. Unusually, neither the Israeli Prime Minister nor its defence or foreign ministers had military backgrounds. &apos;They will want to show they have balls,&apos; explains a friend of Levy Willard&apos;s. So Israel used the kidnapping as the excuse it needed to launch a long-prepared war plan, dubbed &apos;Operation Exterminator&apos;, for the destruction of Hizbollah. During the following 33 days, more than 1,500 people were killed, two-thirds of them Lebanese civilians. The aerial bombardment left Lebanon in ruins and on the verge of civil war and the Israeli military&apos;s reputation badly damaged, as it failed to dislodge Hizbollah and regain its captured soldiers. Hizbollah, whose weaponry and tactics far exceeded Israeli expectations, was politically strengthened. As Levy Willard puts it, having spent time under the whistling Katyusha rockets: &apos;this is not a band of suicidal terrorists in scruffy jeans who squabble among themselves&apos;. Levy Willard interviewed Israeli commandos on a 48-hour leave from combat. &apos;Some of the soldiers chose to injure themselves so that they wouldn&apos;t have to go back ... some fell down stairs deliberately in the hope of breaking a bone.&apos; Summer Rain is partly a parody of the machismo of war reporting - Levy Willard has to argue with her children to let her go to the front line. It also includes intriguing apercus on modern warfare - the general who secretly sells his stock portfolio, the war photographer caught &apos;Photoshopping&apos; more dead babies into his pictures, a song said to be popular with teenage Israelis: &apos;Our Country is Crap But It&apos;s the Only One We Have&apos;. All this captures how fluid political opinions have become with modern media coverage. At first, many of the Israeli Arabs living in Haifa were on the side of their government, but as images of the devastation in Lebanon were fed back by satellite TV, this changed. Ditto many non-Arab Israelis. Novelist David Grossman, whose son was killed in the conflict, made a powerful speech in Tel Aviv months later, stating: &apos;We have discovered in this war that military power cannot ultimately guarantee our existence.&apos; On Israeli TV, an amateur video was screened showing an officer telling exhausted soldiers about the terrorists they will face in Lebanon. &apos;Why call them terrorists?&apos; says one of his men. &apos;They are soldiers like us.&apos; On 16 August, a UN-brokered ceasefire was implemented and both sides declared victory. &apos;The military offensive has eliminated Hizbollah&apos;s state within the state of Lebanon,&apos; claimed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. He subsequently survived an inquiry into the war&apos;s failings by the skin of his teeth. According to Gilbert Achcar and Michel Warschawski&apos;s The 33-Day War, a poll of the &apos;Arab street&apos; conducted after the war found that Hizbollah&apos;s leader Hassan Nasrallah was the most popular political figure in the region. The most unpopular figure, President Bush, had broadcast his private beliefs by mistake six days into the conflict. The US government was refusing to join the EU and UN in calling for a ceasefire, saying Israel must be allowed to root out the &apos;A-team of terrorists&apos;. Then, in his &apos;Yo Blair&apos; conversation, Bush set out a road map for the UN to end the conflict. &apos;What they need to do is get Syria to get Hizbollah to stop doing this shit and it&apos;s all over ...&apos; The degree of ignorance in Bush&apos;s formulation is made clear in this dry but penetrating book. The self-proclaimed pacifist academics (one from Lebanon, one from Israel) paint a picture of an exceptionally complex and politically fluid Lebanon, the most religiously and ethnically mixed country in the region, racked by a 15-year civil war. Hizbollah was born in this period and became the force best equipped to resist Israel&apos;s occupation of the country&apos;s south, eventually driving them out in 2000. Although Hizbollah is funded by Iran and Syria and receives its armaments via the Syrian border, it is a broadly independent organisation which runs schools, hospitals and social services in south Lebanon and enjoys huge support there, not only among the Shias, Lebanon&apos;s largest sect. Hizbollah enjoys far greater autonomy and popular support than characterised in the neocon world view. Looking at Israel, the authors draw the controversial conclusion that its recent military failings and willingness to kill Lebanese civilians stem from the same source: a &apos;colonial&apos; inability to respect their adversary. In former Prime Minister Ehud Barak&apos;s words, Israel is &apos;the modern and prosperous villa in the jungle&apos; of the Middle East, and Israel now formulates its fight for survival as a battle of civilisation versus brutality. This concept is used to justify the apparent imbalance in the value of Arab and Israeli life, which, incidentally, cuts both ways. Hence 429 Hizbollah prisoners were exchanged for one kidnapped Israeli businessman in 2004 and in last summer&apos;s conflict, the civilian body count was 1,070 Lebanese and 43 Israelis. According to this book, Barak&apos;s &apos;civilisation&apos; analysis seems to have been bought wholesale by Washington and by Tony Blair in the wake of 9/11. Blair, somewhat incredibly now a Middle East peace envoy, described the fighting last year as part of an ongoing struggle between &apos;democracy and freedom&apos; against an &apos;arc of extremism right across the region&apos;. Something which ignores the fact that popular feeling in the Middle East, as expressed democratically in the election of Hamas, supports so-called &apos;extremism&apos;. While Hizbollah leads the reconstruction effort in south Lebanon and digs a new set of fortifications, and Israel tops up on bunker-busters ready for the next round, both of these fine books make it clear that the region&apos;s increased stock of fear is keeping no one safe.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-18T23:06:11Z", "title": "Review: Summer Rain | The 33-Day War", "sentences": ["Novelist David Grossman, whose son was killed in the conflict, made a powerful speech in Tel Aviv months later, stating: &apos;We have discovered in this war that military power cannot ultimately guarantee our existence.&apos; On Israeli TV, an amateur video was screened showing an officer telling exhausted soldiers about the terrorists they will face in Lebanon."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/19/politics"}, {"tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Professor Robert Winston Robert Winston is Emiritus Professor of Fertility at Imperial College, London. Best known for his research into human reproduction, he is also famous for his love of egg and chips. I got a lot of stick for supporting omega-3 fatty acids and I&apos;m not sure why, because each week new research comes out that says I was right. There is clear evidence that it is needed for brain development in children and it seems to improve behaviour in adults too. A very interesting study from Oxford University shows that these fatty acids fed to young offenders in an Aylesbury institution improved their concentration and lowered instances of aggression. All I advocated was that omega 3 was likely to help some children if given as an additive in milk, for example. I don&apos;t think I did anything that was in the slightest bit untrustworthy. I&apos;ve never really eaten healthily ... no, that&apos;s not strictly true. There have been times in my life when I&apos;ve made a serious attempt to lose weight and get fit and I&apos;ve done that. For a few months at a time I&apos;ve been eating fruit and not eating fats, being very religious about what I ate. But six months is the longest I&apos;ve done it for. My feeling is that we&apos;ve got genetic scars. We don&apos;t need a craving for fat: we shouldn&apos;t be eating crisps any more but we do. Why do we love them? I think it&apos;s deeply genetic. Right back in time, this love of salt, sweet things, high carbohydrate and high fat would have provided instant energy on the savannah. It might have been the difference between survival or not. It can be really difficult, quite painful, to keep kosher. During my childhood and teens, I was completely observant and I remember that I spent a lot of time hungry. I went to a non-Jewish school and we used to have fairly miserable vegetarian portions, so by the end of the day on the tube back to Arnos Grove I would be ravenous. Then, for about 10 years in my twenties, I didn&apos;t really keep any Jewish laws - it was to do with my social life, with falling in love. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever eaten pork but that&apos;s not the point really. I came back to it because Jewishness is a part of my basic identity and I have kept kosher ever since. Kaifeng is kosher Chinese - there&apos;s another place called Marcus&apos;s, also north London, a few in New York City, one or two in Jerusalem and at least one in Tel Aviv. The Jews of Kaifeng were a real entity in China. I&apos;m a bit hazy about the details, but there has been a Jewish presence in mainland China for centuries. I&apos;m not sure why they settled there but I imagine it was trading and the fact that the Chinese were quite tolerant of them. The restaurant opened about a dozen or so years ago and you will see there&apos;s a man floating around called a shomer who is basically the guy who ensures that all the dietary laws are being kept. Shomer means &apos;someone who guards or keeps&apos;. They wear some form of head covering, most of them have beards and they always look hungry. They usually look dishevelled actually, but I will get myself into trouble now. I&apos;ve never been very big on traditional Jewish food, things like salt beef, chopped liver or cholent, a meat stew that is the traditional Sabbath meal. These things don&apos;t attract me at all; I can&apos;t stand them. Chicken soup is an exception, and we have that at home most Friday nights. But there&apos;s no doubt at all that my favourite meal is fried egg and chips - I love it. When I come into the cafeteria at the House of Lords they don&apos;t ask me what I want, they don&apos;t show me the menu, they just say, &apos;Do you want egg and chips?&apos; They always look slightly upset really. There&apos;s a lot of discussion about the fast-food culture, but to me the main harm is that families are not eating their food together in a domestic environment. And that is quite a Jewish activity, it&apos;s a Chinese activity too, and I think it&apos;s a very cohesive force. My kids are grown-up now but we will come quite often to somewhere like Kaifeng or I will do a barbecue at home at weekends. My daughter, Tania, has been a vegetarian since she was four-and-a-half - I served her fish fingers and she turned around and said, &apos;I can&apos;t eat that. Fish swim&apos; - and she is very strong-willed. So I will be barbecuing some meaty thing for the family and Tania will have her own vegetarian section. And she will come and be a shomer too, to make sure that I am handling her vegetables with different utensils. She really is very strict. \u00b7 Kaifeng, 51 Church Road, London NW4 (020 8203 7888) Radha Jain, under-9 chess champion Radha Jain is the English Girls Under-9 chess champion and is representing England at the World Youth Championships in Turkey this November. Discipline is her middle name. It&apos;s really important to eat the right things before playing chess. I don&apos;t eat sugar, or sweets, and I don&apos;t eat just before my round, either, because that way you get sleepy. I don&apos;t even have sugar the day before a match. I drink a lot of water, because thinking really dehydrates you. Bananas are good for concentration, though, and I&apos;ll eat those between rounds. I love Indian food, and that&apos;s what we mostly eat at home, though sometimes we have pasta and pizza. My favourite dish is dosa - a big Indian pancake, with all sorts of fillings, such as paneer or samba, and they do great ones at the Indian Kitchen. I love the ambience as well as the food here, especially the big red flowers on each table. The staff are also really polite and helpful. Generally we don&apos;t go out to eat, though, and Mum does most of the cooking. She&apos;s a very good cook. My dad has an office in the house, and he stays there most of the day; he doesn&apos;t do much cooking. I do cook a tiny bit at home - mostly chapatis, filled with sabjis and dhal. I prefer Indian food - I like its spiciness, and I think it&apos;s healthier than English food. There are also lots of vegetarian dishes, which is good because of my religion - I&apos;m a Jain, and we do not believe in killing animals. I started playing chess when I was seven. I like the way the game challenges you all the time. My dad and my brother [Akash Jain, 13, currently Under-13 British Champion] also play chess. I started beating my dad about one-and-a-half years ago. He didn&apos;t mind too much. I probably practise about an hour a day - either on the computer, or against my brother. My brother&apos;s three years older and thinks he&apos;s much better than me at chess. When he was my age, though, he wasn&apos;t as good as I am now. One day I&apos;d like to be a Women&apos;s Grand Master. I&apos;ve played so much chess now that I don&apos;t really get nervous before matches. Sometimes playing against the clock can be stressful, though. Some games can go on a really long time; the longest one I ever played was four-and-a-half hours. I like the puzzle of chess. You have to stretch for tactics and chances to win. The person that plays the first move that comes into his head always loses. Normally I think about three moves ahead, sometimes more. My schoolfriends aren&apos;t that into chess. We just talk, really. And we play netball, and rounders. My favourite thing of all is when a cocky boy comes up to me and thinks he can thrash me because I&apos;m a girl, and I beat him easily. That&apos;s very satisfying. Edward Marriott \u00b7 The Indian Kitchen, 73 Ryefield Parade, Northwood Hills, Middlesex (01923 842647) Professor Steve Jones Steve Jones is Professor of Genetics at University College, London. His writing on evolution won him the prestigious Royal Society Michael Faraday prize, and his work as a biologist led to his becoming a vegetarian. We live in a unique time in history from the point of view of diet because for the first time the poor are fat and the rich are thin. It&apos;s quite arguable that my generation is going to be the longest-living in history because the next generation is suffering from the plague of obesity, which is going to shorten life expectancy by a lot. There are thousands of scientists working on obesity and there&apos;s a thing called the Human Obesity Gene Map. The last time I looked at it there were 560 candidate genes for obesity which means everybody has got some of them. What causes obesity? Overeating. I was talking to Sydney Brenner, who won the Nobel Prize in 2002, and he said, &apos;Steve, we discovered the gene for obesity years ago: it&apos;s the one that makes you open your mouth&apos;. I&apos;m always asked, &apos;Do you eat snails?&apos; I started collecting them as a biology undergraduate in the Sixties and, the last time I looked, I had killed about 400,000, so when I&apos;m asked the question I know the answer in about 15 different languages. In fact, I haven&apos;t eaten snails since about 1985. For one thing, I find them really quite beautiful and elegant, but I just don&apos;t like the taste and I know what they eat, which can be pretty disgusting. I&apos;m also a vegetarian now and have been pretty much since I went to teach at the University of Botswana in the mid-Seventies. On my first day in the country I ended up with a group of students at the largest slaughterhouse in the southern hemisphere. Botswana is a very big cattle-rearing country and we went to this very well-run place - these poor cows going &apos;Moo&apos; and getting shot and then opening them up to look for gut parasites. I am a biologist, I&apos;ve cut up plenty of animals, so it doesn&apos;t really worry me - I was splitting them open, pulling out tapeworms. But I kept hearing these heavy thumps and, I turned around, it was the students fainting: donk, donk, donk. I suddenly thought, &apos;You know something, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to eat meat again&apos;, and I never have. I eat lunch every day at the student cafeteria at UCL, and have done for almost 30 years. I always have the same thing, a boring vegetarian salad. When I&apos;m working I want lunch to be as simple as possible. The mathematical philosopher Wittgenstein came up with a phrase I often think of: &apos;I don&apos;t mind what I eat, so long as it&apos;s always the same thing.&apos; What people fail to understand about science, particularly biology, is that it is tremendously repetitive. If you are studying DNA variation, it involves coming in every morning, putting on the same goddamn lab coat, doing the same complicated, linear series of things, often 40 or 50 steps, and if any one goes wrong, that&apos;s it, the day&apos;s wasted. You do this for hundreds if not thousands of days, one after another. So when it comes to lunch, you don&apos;t want to think too hard. I come from a very ordinary lower-middle-class Welsh family, and growing up, I never thought too much about what I ate. When I was an undergraduate in Edinburgh, I began the Scottish Suicide Diet. I would get up at noon and have a pork pie and four cups of coffee, then I would have fish and chips for lunch and a Mars bar at 3am. After 10 years of that I thought, &apos;Maybe this isn&apos;t wise&apos;. The reason I enjoy cooking now is that when I was doing my PhD, I used to go off on field trips where you were in the middle of nowhere and were forced to cook. Lots of field biologists are like that. I do most of the cooking at home, but I&apos;m not averse to going out and spending a fair amount of money on a meal. A couple of years ago I went with my wife and her cousin to - what&apos;s that one in Chelsea? I think it&apos;s Gordon Ramsay. I have never got nearer to getting up and punching a waiter in my life. The food was very good - it was a bit mucked around for my tastes - but if there&apos;s one thing that drives me mad it&apos;s having a meal as if you are in intensive care. In other words, little metaphorical bleeps going on all around you, people with grey faces waiting for the next crisis. If that&apos;s what you want why not get hooked up to a drip in hospital to go through the full experience? \u00b7 The university canteen is not open to non-students Dr Alice Roberts Dr Alice Roberts is a clinical anatomist and osteoarchaeologist teaching at Bristol University. She presented Don&apos;t Die Young on BBC2 and is strongly committed to public engagement with science and medicine. Many issues of health and food are very complicated and I don&apos;t want to preach or set myself up as a paragon of virtue - that wasn&apos;t what Don&apos;t Die Young was about at all. My main concern is the rising levels of preventable diseases, like cancer and heart disease. It&apos;s bizarre and shocking - we know the risk factors and still they are on the increase. Two years ago, my partner, Dave, and I moved into a 1930s farm-worker&apos;s cottage a few miles outside Bristol. The garden is not huge, but it&apos;s big enough to grow vegetables in, and from June to around Christmas last year, we didn&apos;t have to buy any vegetables. The provenance of food is really important to me, and that&apos;s one of the reasons I like the Primrose Caf\u00e9 in Clifton. They are great proponents of the Slow Food movement and organic produce, and there are loads of options if you&apos;re a vegetarian, which I have been since I was 18. After I made up my mind to become vegetarian, I went on holiday to Greece and ate a lot of lamb - because I absolutely love the way they cook lamb in Greece - and then I came home and gave up meat. However, in May, Dave and I found a deer on the road that had been knocked down and killed. We rang some friends who turned up and we lifted it into the boot. The following day, we went around to Nick and Miranda&apos;s, where they had hung the deer in their garage. Using my anatomical skills, and being careful to avoid the hundreds of ticks, we gutted the deer into a wheelbarrow. Some days later we went back to skin it and cut it up, so there&apos;s now a pile of venison in Nick and Miranda&apos;s freezer, and we&apos;re planning a roadkill dinner party. I&apos;m wrestling with the idea of eating this meat, as there doesn&apos;t seem to be any ethical objection: I wasn&apos;t responsible for the animal&apos;s death and I have always enjoyed the taste of meat. But I&apos;m worried that I might like it too much. Although the process of converting the dead animal into joints of meat was a messy, mechanical business, there was also something quite moving about it. At the moment, I have no idea if I&apos;ll eat it. I imagine I will decide on the day. \u00b7 Primrose Caf\u00e9 and Bistro, Boyces Avenue, Clifton Village, Bristol (0117 946 6577) Professor Susan Greenfield Susan Greenfield is Professor of Synaptic Pharmacology at Lincoln College, Oxford. She has been awarded a CBE for her contributions to the public understanding of science, and the French L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur. She doesn&apos;t miss the Spam fritters of her youth. I find it very encouraging that science is starting to find its way into food preparation. For a long time scientists were thought of as non-sensual people, like Mekons, and science was not considered relevant to everyday life. Chefs like Heston Blumenthal show that food should be fun, you should take time to eat, that a table should be for something much more than ingesting calories. Fifty years from now, I can see us having a vastly improved knowledge of nutrition. I also think we will see a decline in obesity, simply because it is becoming such a problem. I have a big problem in that I adore eating and hate cooking, so I love restaurants like Le Manoir. I&apos;m a Baby Boomer and grew up in the Fifties, before food was interesting. My mother used to say, &apos;I can&apos;t see the point in cooking because it&apos;s all gone in half an hour.&apos; I&apos;m sure that brainwashed me slightly. For me, being able to produce food like Raymond Blanc does at Le Manoir would be as possible as jumping off a cliff and flying. When I was a child, we would eat things like salad with salad cream, Spam fritters and Vesta chow mein - standard fare, really. But, perhaps more than the average family, my parents liked to experiment with Indian and Chinese restaurants, both of which were starting to come in to England at that time. The other special meal was Sunday lunch. I&apos;m half-Jewish, on my father&apos;s side, and culturally it has been a big influence on me. We would eat gefilte fish, smoked herring and coleslaw and your school reports would be handed round the whole family. The culture is similar to what I see in my Asian students now, where the extended family is very engaged in the education of the next generation. I have fond memories of getting my school report back from my uncle and there was a ten-shilling note inside, because I had done well. My early cooking experiences were Mary Baker cakes - they were marketed as &apos;just add an egg&apos; because the housewife of that time would not want instant cakes but, as long as she was doing something, that was fine. As a kid, my mum let me do this and I remember the magic - that when you put them in the oven, they expanded and became golden and changed properties. I suppose that was an early grounding in science. My cooking never really developed from there, I think mostly because I&apos;m a very impatient person. Everything changed when I lived in Paris for a year when I was 27. I didn&apos;t learn to cook - in France you can go to any old supermarket and serve a fabulous lunch of pat\u00e9, saucisson sec, camembert and a baguette. I lived near the market on Rue de Seine in the Latin Quarter and the French housewives would make such an effort to get the absolute best produce: they would pick food up, pinch it, smell it, push it. It had a real influence on me. When I arrived, I was a typical scruffy Oxford student but within two weeks I was making sure that I had painted my nails and that my shoes matched my handbag. I usually have the 10-course Menu D\u00e9couverte when I come here, which is fantastic because you get to try so many things. I like eating a lot and I have quite a high metabolic rate. For me, it would be torture to go on a diet of any type. I&apos;m just a pig. I used to be a smoker and I cruised through life at seven-and-a-half stone with beer and ice cream and three-course meals, aided and abetted by cigarettes. Since I stopped, I&apos;ve rocketed up to eight-and-a-half, nine. But for me, starving yourself means cutting off the most wonderful sensual experiences. As someone once said, &apos;Food is the sensuality of old age&apos;. My great vice now is coffee - it has become the surrogate cigarette. When I gave up smoking, I realised that I was missing the reward system - if there was a particularly hard phone call or I had finished a paragraph, I would light up a cigarette. I can see that I have now substituted the coffee for the cigarettes. I know I should cut back but life is short and I think we mustn&apos;t get so po-faced and self-righteous that we throw out the fun with everything else. \u00b7 Le Manoir aux Quat&apos; Saisons, Great Milton, Oxford (01844 278881) Professor AC Grayling AC Grayling is Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck University, London. He is devoted to making the basics of philosophy available to all. I do think there is a strong correlation between the food you put into your body and your mental wellbeing. I&apos;m very fond of saying to people, I repeat it endlessly, that a normal human lifespan is less than a thousand months long. That means that you have got to make the best use of everything you&apos;ve got. So if you were to be very irresponsible about your body and became incredibly obese or drugged to your eyeballs or drunk all the time or hardly able to breathe because you smoke too much, then you would be failing yourself in this little bit of equipment that helps you to process thoughts. Eating right and exercising right is just obviously the right basis. My mother was a very neurotic, anxious, bad-tempered, difficult person. She was nervous about a lot of things. We lived in Africa, so she was worried about snakes and spiders, and she thought the Africans among whom we lived would murder us one day. It&apos;s amazing they didn&apos;t, considering the way that expats lived in central Africa in those days. But she was also nervous about people swallowing fish bones and choking to death, or meat going off in the hot weather, so I have early memories of anxiety, food being a source of worry and a potential threat. And I&apos;ve never been a great fish-eater, very probably because of my mother. We had a number of servants, but our cook, who was with us for a very long time, was very good indeed. He had the whole range: he could cook the roast and two veg, but he would also make delicious puddings and pastries and bake bread. It was a good British diet, better than most people were eating in Britain at that time because of the aftermath of war. There was no difficulty getting food and there were also a lot of local foods such as sweetcorn, sweet potatoes and yams and we had a very big garden with lots of fruit trees. The one fruit we didn&apos;t eat was avocado pear. My mother had never come across it before in England or anywhere and she thought it was horrible, green and slimy. Our time in Africa ended in a very, very tragic way. I had a sister, seven years older than me, who was murdered by persons unknown. She had married somebody not long before and he was indicted for her murder but acquitted, so if he didn&apos;t do it we don&apos;t know who did. And it was an absolutely horrible thing because she was missing for some time and finally they found her body in a river in South Africa. My mother wasn&apos;t well at the time, she had a heart complaint, and she and my father had to go and identify my sister&apos;s body. It made my mother very ill and shortly afterwards she had a heart attack and died. I was here at university and I had to fly out to be with my father and brother. My father, as you can imagine, was completely devastated, and my brother and I had the responsibility of propping him up, and my brother, who is older than me, had to organise my mother&apos;s funeral. Neither of us had the opportunity to grieve properly, and it took a long time to come to terms with it. And I found that, when I got back to the UK a couple of months later, the only fruit I could eat that had any tropical association was avocado, because we never ate it when we were in Africa. To this day, I don&apos;t eat bananas or mangoes or anything like that - they bring back memories. I am a vegetarian now and have been for about 30 years. I must have become one in my late twenties, and it was quite a process. I spent a long time thinking about it, considering the pros and cons, before I came to a decision that, for me, is part ethical and part aesthetic. For a short while, smoked salmon was an honorary vegetable; I found it a little bit difficult to give that up. But when I became completely vegetarian, about two weeks after I last had any meat or fish, I was going for a walk in Regent&apos;s Park and feeling absolutely wonderful, full of energy and clarity and light. And I was thinking to myself, &apos;What&apos;s going to go wrong now?&apos; But that feeling of energy and lightness has stayed with me ever since. I stopped drinking alcohol a little before, just because I always found that it disagreed with me. At that very early stage, I became interested in what I am mainly interested in now, which is Italian, Indian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern food. All those four cuisines are absolutely as easy as pie for vegetarians. If you walk into an ordinary Italian restaurant you can eat very tasty food in unfussy, inexpensive circumstances, whereas in order to eat really well if you eat meat, you have got to go upmarket. You are going to get a piece of leather if you go into a cheapo place and order a steak. Cantina is a bit upmarket as Italian restaurants go, but the food is simple, fresh and delicious, and I like to come here with friends and family. I don&apos;t really cook myself, although I do find the textures, colours and perfumes of raw food really rather lovely. Sometimes I think I&apos;d like to do it, but there&apos;s only a thousand months, you know. \u00b7 Cantina del Ponte, Butler&apos;s Wharf, London SE1 (020 7403 5403) \u00b7 For more food news, gossip and recipes, go to our blog, Word of Mouth", "publicationDate": "2007-08-19T14:29:30Z", "title": "Tim Lewis asked top food boffins to reveal their eating habits", "sentences": ["Kaifeng is kosher Chinese - there&apos;s another place called Marcus&apos;s, also north London, a few in New York City, one or two in Jerusalem and at least one in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/aug/19/healthandwellbeing.foodanddrink"}, {"tags": ["Health", "Health & wellbeing", "Society", "UK news", "Life and style"], "article": "Here comes the No 1 gruesome invention of the century: the bra you wear 1cm under your skin, called Cup&amp;Up. Dr Eyal Gur, head of microsurgery at the Sourasky medical centre in Tel Aviv, has thought up this ghastly procedure, and claims that droves of women are clamouring to have it done for a few thousand pounds. They must be raving mad because this is what it entails: two sling-shaped silicone cups are inserted through slits beneath each breast. Then, to hold them up, threads are stitched on and attached to your upper ribs with titanium screws. Ouch. What&apos;s more - and this is meant to be a bonus - you can have it done under local anaesthetic. You can be aware of the process, and be home in time for tea. I tell everyone about this grisly plan; their jaws drop open and they all ask the same question. &quot;Why?&quot; Why indeed. What is wrong with droopy bosoms? If you really, truly love them, then you should surely love them throughout their gentle decline, but throughout history there seems to have been an ongoing quest to have them hauled up around your neck, overflowing in some way or other and divided by a Grand Canyon cleavage. Howard Hughes - in desperate straits in 1943 with his film project The Outlaw about to collapse before filming had even begun and an unknown starlet, Jane Russell, as main protagonist - knew that he needed the Grand Canyon effect to save his bacon. He called in aeronautical engineers to design an appropriate brassiere, and bingo - La Russell became an overnight star and the film a winner. With just your common, external brassiere. We don&apos;t need Dr Gur. He is going too far. His plan doesn&apos;t even seem to be just for huge, or particularly pendulous bosoms. It&apos;s for anyone who desires an &quot;enhanced cleavage&quot;, and does not wish to wear a bra - except when doing sports. Can it be worth it, just so that persons can stare in a glazed way at your chest? Notice that a man invented Cup&amp;Up. Perhaps men should keep out of the world of breasts and brassieres. It is a female world and we should be in charge of it. My friend Clayden entered it recently. He was obliged to help a friend by collecting her giant bra from a specialist shop. Down he went into the warm basement to join the queue - the only chap among dozens of women with tremendously large bosoms, some confidently popping in and out of their cubicles wearing the brassieres. &quot;There was an atmosphere of worship of the breast - a sort of pride, no embarrassment,&quot; says Clayden. He felt rather intimidated, in a heavenly sort of way, but tried his best not to show it or stare. &quot;It was a strange situation,&quot; he said, &quot;unique rather than thrilling. I was seeing another world. Like being a plumber in the harem.&quot; This world is no place for Dr Gur. But women determined to go ahead with his grisly &quot;Minimally Invasive Mastopexy&quot; (the first one is planned for this autumn in Belgium) may like to know that the implants have been tried inside a pig&apos;s chest wall. &quot;Pigs&apos; skin most closely resembles human skin, and the Cup&amp;Up held in place nicely,&quot; says Adi Cohen, the head of the company promoting the procedure. Not really kosher for Tel Aviv. Not really kosher for anywhere. Parents who smoke spliffs in front of children can now be arrested, taken to the police station, given a formal warning and allowed home again. That&apos;s all. Shadow home secretary David Davies and his followers are outraged. They presumably want a harsher punishment. But what? Flogging? Prison? That&apos;s too brutal. And why even tick them off? It won&apos;t make the weeniest difference. I know because I have tried. Once upon a time, I had a partner who insisted on smoking dope, binge style, for days on end. It made him babble rubbish ceaselessly, day and night, gobble up my mother&apos;s cakes and offer my child, struggling with GCSEs at the time, the odd spliff. Or he might ponce spliffs from her chums, while using what he thought to be hip language that he felt would endear him to the young and make him seem cool. The young were not impressed. And it all brought great shame upon me, for having such a clot of a partner. How many times did I tick him off, reprimand, break down, ban him from the house, scream and shout, extract promises of abstinence which were never kept, explain that my daughter was at a vital stage of her life in which drugs were to be avoided, insist that he not undermine me? Hundreds of times. And did it make a difference? Not the slightest. I feel fairly bitter about all this, and guilty for not sacking him at once. I longed at the time for the harshest of punishments - the rack, the stocks, the wheel or a fetid dungeon. But it wasn&apos;t allowed, and our relationship mouldered on and eventually died, poisoned mainly by dope. I was never all that keen on the stuff, and naturally I now can&apos;t bear it, but this is a difficult problem because there are different ways of smoking dope in front of children. There&apos;s the rather poncy &quot;aren&apos;t we liberal and laid back - we let our children share a joint at dinner&quot; sort, and there are street druggies hoping to recruit disciples and runners and wreck a few more lives. Formal cautions will stop none of them. Perhaps our best hope is the young themselves. They always try their very best to distance themselves from grown-ups. In these cases, they must try harder.

That may sound supercilious but the reinstatement of the former captain, who should feature in the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers so long as his injury clears up and his form holds up, actually showed a manager drilling down to the bedrock truth of his job. He initially dreamed of a reborn England who would perform with pace and movement, making Beckham obsolete. A year on from McClaren&apos;s first fixture, the 4-0 beating of Greece in a friendly, reality has set in and the immediate thought is simply of reaching the finals, not of leaving the rest of the continent awestruck if and when the side get there. McClaren must understand his predecessor better than ever, appreciating Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s devotion to whatever worked relatively well, even if the limitations would ultimately be exposed in the quarter-finals of competitions. The Premier League and Champions League are always elbowing England priorities out of the way, and a manager of the national team has to make do as best he can. That was precisely what happened in the last match, when Beckham set up two goals and England, winning 3-0 against Estonia, enjoyed a better result than any other Group E visitor to Tallinn. It brought some calm to supporters and respite to McClaren. The four remaining qualifiers at Wembley began to look like advantages that England truly might exploit. None the less the manager was never supposed to let the situation become so interesting. When the draw was made, in January 2006, a joshing Eriksson said: &quot;At least I did my job today...&quot; and added that his successor could be &quot;happy&quot; since England might have landed in a far harder group. He was right about that. At the outset, McClaren enjoyed encouragement. Greece were compliant opponents, John Terry eased himself into the captaincy, Steven Gerrard played as if he really was convinced that there was enough scope on the right, Stewart Downing supplied orthodox width on the other flank and Peter Crouch scored twice. There was another gambol for the Liverpool striker and the rest of the team against Andorra at Old Trafford and Crouch struck again to down Macedonia in a gritty away match four days later. It was all as freewheeling as Eriksson had indicated. No one would have anticipated McClaren&apos;s initiation into the dark aspects of his post coming at home to Macedonia. A 0-0 draw sent doubt racing through the country and the derision towards Downing&apos;s efforts was the start of a broader hostility. The response was disproportionate from the management as England chose to experiment with 3-5-2 for what had always looked certain to be the toughest game, against Croatia in Zagreb. Paul Robinson&apos;s fresh-air kick at a Gary Neville pass-back for the second goal in a 2-0 defeat was one embarrassment among many. Terry Venables was presumed to be the champion of 3-5-2 and the talk of an estrangement from McClaren intensified when he offered a different explanation from the manager by saying that Downing had been omitted because the hostility of England fans had hit his confidence. Supporters, too, had confronted Wayne Rooney and other members of the squad following the defeat by Croatia. It was time to take cover and McClaren was wise to cancel a trip to the US where he had meant to learn about NFL methods. Better to be seen at Manchester United v Liverpool. A moderately encouraging draw with Holland in one friendly was followed by defeat to Spain in the next and the manager continued to be under siege in Tel Aviv. Many visitors struggle there, but the witlessness in the 0-0 draw was an affront and the idea of letting the squad have a night out in the city was cancelled. England needed all the seclusion they could find. So raw was the antagonism before kick-off against Andorra in Barcelona that the shock scattered concentration and self-belief. The three goals did not come until the second half with the character of Gerrard, scorer of two, redeeming the side. It had better be true that the adversity has enhanced camaraderie. McClaren appreciates that there can be no prospect for some time of a new vision for England and nor can he expect to be perceived as the innovative leader he wishes to be. The horizons have closed in and points are all that matters. So far as status is concerned, Wembley was opened satisfactorily even if Brazil equalised in stoppage-time. There is no new system, no new dawn and, when both men are available, he may have to concur with Eriksson that the problematic partnership of Gerrard and Frank Lampard is the best on offer in central midfield. Injuries have stopped him from seeing a young winger like Aaron Lennon emerge. His handling of individuals has been flawed and by preferring Ledley King, whose body is racked with problems, McClaren alienated Jamie Carragher. Visions of transformation are in storage and delighting the public is no priority at all. England, by whatever means necessary, have to get through in Group E if McClaren is to survive in his job.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-22T01:23:06Z", "title": "McClaren's annual report reveals little scope for error", "sentences": ["A moderately encouraging draw with Holland in one friendly was followed by defeat to Spain in the next and the manager continued to be under siege in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/aug/21/mcclarensannualreportreveal"}, {"tags": ["Life and style"], "article": "Just as every yin must have its yang, so Hadley&apos;s priceless &quot;A Jew Writes&quot; item - a new Lost in Showbiz strand, I pray - must be complemented by the worthless outpourings of a shiksa.

Chris Dodd called the comment &quot;tasteless&quot; and liberal bloggers are savaging her for, in their view, caving to the Republican framing of the terror issue. These critics are being extraordinarily historically naive. If all Clinton meant was that a genuine terror attack would empower Republicans, then under the current social consensus, her comment is in poor taste. (Though this notion, that examining the possible domestic fallout of terror attacks is vulgar or unpatriotic, is one of those quasi-Victorian conventions that does not serve the vigorous debate needed in a time of crisis). But if Clinton is also trying to warn voters about something even more difficult for us to talk about, then she is absolutely right, even brave, and her critics are frighteningly ill-informed about the past. Clinton is right to caution voters to consider the domestic outcome of a possible terror-related event before the election if you factor into her caution this forbidden subtext: if the terror scare in question is exaggerated, or even manufactured, to serve a domestic political purpose. Even as I write those words, I understand I am breaching a major social taboo. There is a general polite consensus right now that maintains two no-debate areas. Firstly, you are not, if you are a serious person, allowed to note in public that it is possible that this White House or any US leader might conceivably distort or hype the terror threat for political purposes - although plenty of serious people discuss this possibility in private. Secondly, if you are a serious person, you are not allowed to suggest in public that it is remotely possible that in America elections could possibly be deliberately thrown off course any more directly than, say, the vote recount of 2000. Sadly, these two taboos fly in the face of history, both of the history of weakening democracies overseas and the history of our own nation. It is standard practice for corrupt leaders who are seeking a certain political outcome to hype or manipulate a terror threat or a threat of violent domestic subversion. While sometimes the threat is manufactured, frequently the hyped threat is based on a real danger. Stalin warned of &quot;sleepers,&quot; covert agents of capitalism who would rise up at a signal and wreak mayhem arming peaceful Soviet citizens, in an invented threat. But General Pinochet secured his coup in Chile in 1973 by elaborating upon a genuine threat: citizens were told that armed Unidad Popular insurgents, who were real, were planning a terror attack - a mass assassination of national leaders - a charge which was not real. He even showed their purported arms caches neatly lined up on TV and released, to the horror of Chileans, faked documents planning the alleged attack, the sinisterly named &quot;Plan Z&quot;. Similar tactics have been duplicated by corrupt leaders in many contexts worldwide. Has the US itself never hyped a threat for political purposes? When it seemed as if there would be a war with France, the Sedition Act of 1798 was passed after President John Adams had managed to scare Americans about French refugees in the US who were dead set, he warned, on &quot;sedition.&quot; President Wilson&apos;s committee on public information churned out propaganda in the form of unsubstantiated, terrifying atrocity stories to prepare the ground for reluctant American citizens to support our entry into the first world war. The justice department during the sceond world war generated support for the internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans with suggestions that they might otherwise engage in &quot;espionage&quot; and &quot;sabotage.&quot; While General Eisenhower did not participate in senator Joe McCarthy&apos;s red-baiting directly leading up to the 1952 election, he did not repudiate the tactics. Moreover, by calling Democrats &quot;traitors&quot; in its party platform, Eisenhower&apos;s Republican party exploited the senator&apos;s alarming national iteration that a secret network of subversives had infiltrated the state department, Hollywood and even the army, intent on a bloody revolution to install a Communist regime in the US - a charge that, as Ted Morgan exhaustively noted in his history Reds: McCarthyism in Twentieth-Century America, was a violent inflammation of a partial truth. Has the US never used agents provocateurs or fake documents to provoke, demonstrate or hype a threat for political purposes? David Cunningham, in his magisterial study There&apos;s Something Happening Here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI Counterintelligence, documents the extensive use of agents provocateurs by the FBI during the 1960s and early 1970s. These provocateurs were trained to infiltrate groups such as the civil rights movement and, later, the anti-war movement, and engage in destruction of property and violence - thus casting these entities in the public eye as scary, destabilizing threats to American values and social order. As for fake documents to hype a terror threat - well: sometimes the elephant is just right in the middle of the room. One only has to mention the yellowcake charge that led us straight into the Iraq war. This administration has already distorted a terror scare for political purposes in a fairly substantial way. As Frank Rich, in his book The Greatest Story Ever Sold, and many other commentators - including the Italian journalists who originally rejected the forged documents - have proven, the documents that the White House used to under gird its warning that &quot;we don&apos;t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud&quot; were identified to the administration as flat-out forgeries by level after level of journalists, intelligence staff, State Department employees, and so on. These documents were used to scare the heck out of us anyway, and almost 4,000 young people are now dead. Finally, I am sorry to say, there is the fact that, historically, when leaders are seeking to close down an open society, the months leading up to an election are traditionally the most unstable time - the period most likely to see reports of a frightening purported threat &quot;just-foiled,&quot; an apparent awful breach &quot;just-averted,&quot; or even a dramatic actual provocation - which requires, then, a strong hand to restore &quot;public order.&quot; Hillary Clinton pointed out that even though it is a &quot;horrible prospect,&quot; sometimes you have to ask: &quot;what if?&quot; At the conclusion of my argument about the closing down of our democracy in The End of America: A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot, there is a series of &quot;what ifs?&quot; positing various scenarios, based on the historical record about closing societies, that could realistically play out - yes, even here in America - in the run-up to the election. To put it mildly: you want to know and think about the history of such scenarios in advance, since such tactics depend upon the element of surprise. Let&apos;s also compare the way this White House talks about the terror threat with the way other societies that have decades-long experience with terrorist attacks do. And let&apos;s use our common sense. Anyone who has ever lived in Israel - a country where, since its very birth, sophisticated terrorists have been targeting the civilian population day and night - knows that you never get the equivalent of broad-anxiety-inducing alerts in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem like the &quot;red alert&quot; or &quot;orange alert&quot; system in the US. At the most, in Israel, you get practical, low-key, usable information from the state - for example, &quot;avoid the Machaneh Yehudah marketplace this Friday afternoon&quot; - no matter who is in power. Israelis, consequently, experience, on the day-to-day level, the possibility of terror attacks as a specific, real danger - but not as a state-produced existential condition, a matrix of helpless fear. Indeed, avoiding national fear from terror attacks is a point of pride in Israel that transcends party lines. Nor do Israelis get our regular-as-rain triumphalist narratives in the press about this or that terrorist&apos;s creepy bio, his sinister face, or this or that thwarted, grandiose attack on this or that cherished national monument. There is not a constant struggle between the Knesset and the party in power over the declassification of intelligence, comparable to our struggle here at home. Rather, when there is something the people need to know, Mossad lets the people&apos;s leaders - whatever party is in power - know it. Everyone in Israel understands that terror is too serious to mess with politically - that intelligence about attacks is too important to disclose or to conceal for political purposes - and that Mossad is always, very quietly, at work. Anyone who has lived in the UK during the years of regular, bloody IRA bombings has experienced similar restraint. Nations that have long been primarily intent on tracking and thwarting terrorists - rather than, perhaps, driving policy with fear - just don&apos;t talk about terrorism in the same way (or nearly so much). Even now, fighting the very same &quot;bad guys&quot; that we are fighting, Gordon Brown has reminded his nation and ours that &quot;terrorism is not a cause, it is a crime.&quot; Finally, if this administration did not have a six-year track record of violating other major democratic principles that stand in its way, it would be easier to dismiss the need for a warning of this kind. Is it irrational to consider the possibility of a hyped threat or even a provocation before the election? If this White House had no actual major record of hyping a threat - if the U.S. had no record of inflating various fears for political ends - and if weakening democracies worldwide had no record of manipulating terror narratives to drive certain outcomes, it would indeed be illogical, even paranoid, to worry about a possible hyped threat or provocation that is politically driven. But given the current administration&apos;s record of lying to congress, the American people and to the UN about such threats, given that it used fake documents to do so, given that it has often splashed out widely-reported terror charges that then vanish or subside, given our own nation&apos;s history of not being immune to the temptations on the part of leaders of using fear to drive a political outcome, is it not, rather, almost criminally naive to refuse even to consider the possibility of a hyped threat or provocation close to the election? The consequences of maintaining this denial may be nothing - or they may be very serious indeed. It is never smart, even in a strong democracy, to declare some debate off limits. In a weakening democracy it is catastrophic. Our refusal to look squarely at the possibility that our American president might manipulate our fears has an element of pathology to it: we are like an abused woman who wants to believe that surely this time he will do what is right, or a child in an abusive family who can&apos;t look at the fact that daddy might not be an ever-benign protector. Such collective blind spots are dangerous always, but especially now. Dan Goleman, the author of Emotional Intelligence and Vital Lies, Simple Truths (and, in disclosure, my maternal uncle) points out that every group observes what he calls &quot;The Four Attentional Rules.&quot; &quot;In any group,&quot; he notes, &quot;from the family, to organizations, to entire societies, there are these unstated rules that we learn tacitly about the questions that can&apos;t be asked.&quot; The four rules are: (1) Here&apos;s what we notice; (2) Here&apos;s what we call it; (3) Here&apos;s what can&apos;t be noticed, and; (4) We are at a loss to talk about it because we can&apos;t admit we see it. Number four is just too serious to risk at a time such as this. Let&apos;s dare to release our immature fantasies of a magically faultless US system and a magically protected election process. We have been lucky as a nation but sometimes continued luck depends on action. Hillary Clinton&apos;s rivals should back down. She was the first to dare to imply what we must all directly consider. Sometimes collective blind spots - agreements not to look - are not a problem. But sometimes, in a dramatically weakening democracy, such blind spots can become big enough to prove self-destructive indeed.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-29T11:00:08Z", "title": "The threat of a threat", "sentences": ["Anyone who has ever lived in Israel - a country where, since its very birth, sophisticated terrorists have been targeting the civilian population day and night - knows that you never get the equivalent of broad-anxiety-inducing alerts in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem like the &quot;red alert&quot; or &quot;orange alert&quot; system in the US."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/29/thethreatofathreat"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Madonna", "Culture", "Malawi", "Africa"], "article": "Fellow handcart travellers, there&apos;s just so much Madonna news this week that it seems apt to begin with a summary.

I hope you&apos;re sedated. First, then, to reports that the singer is planning to adopt a young orphan girl from Malawi, the same country in Africa-land from which she obtained an orphan-effect boy last year. Apparently, she has selected a 13-month-old called Mercy from the Kondanani Orphan Care Centre in the Malawian city of Blantyre, and will file adoption papers in February, having viewed 10 girls from the facility. On the basis of no evidence whatsoever, Lost in Showbiz imagines this process as a kind of Orphan Idol-style whittle-down: something fun for the little mites to get involved in to distract from their life of impoverished obscurity, certainly, but a personal growth adventure that must ultimately end in heartache for all but one picturesque infant, whose charisma and responsiveness to bowdlerised Kabbalah texts are deemed to beat all the other young hopefuls. As for the disappointed runners-up, their only task following elimination is to declare tearily that &quot;it&apos;s been an amazing journey&quot;, before giving a mournful, penny whistle-accompanied rendition of Close Every Door to impassive judges from Madonna&apos;s entourage.

It sounds just the sort of adorable form of folk communication that could be co-opted as a musical influence for a future Madonna album, upon which we&apos;ll confer the working title We Are One Tribe.

As I sit staring out of my window at a typically grey and overcast London sky, I&apos;m already counting down the days till I&apos;m once more lounging on the golden beaches of Tel Aviv, or kicking back in the sun-bleached Jerusalem parks. But, for all that life in the Holy Land is an aesthetically pleasurable experience and one that I&apos;m more than grateful for, Wednesday night&apos;s game at Arsenal brought home to me the &quot;paradise lost&quot; aspect of the land I now call home. There was nothing about the evening&apos;s entertainment that I haven&apos;t encountered countless times over the years I&apos;ve been faithfully trekking to Highbury to watch my team - except that now I see the whole excursion through the prism of Israeli eyes. And the ability to see things through the eyes of the &quot;other&quot; is something sorely lacking in many people who criticise and condemn Israelis for their nervous traits, many of whom are the same people demanding that Israelis do just that when judging the Palestinians for their actions. The simple act of walking into the tube station and not being forced through a metal detector; the complete nonchalance with which I viewed my fellow passengers once aboard the train; the distinct lack of machine-gun wielding soldiers on every street corner - all a telling reminder of how far removed from normality Israeli life is for those who live it on a daily basis. Whatever your political views, there is no denying that the mere act of existing in the Israeli entity puts you on edge in a way that no resident of Europe can ever truly comprehend. Which is why it&apos;s no wonder that many Europeans can&apos;t even begin to deal with why Israel allows its army and government to act with the iron fist that they do. I&apos;m a regular and outspoken critic of the way the IDF carries out its defensive duties, but I&apos;m also under no illusions that they are acting with a carte blanche granted by a fearful and paranoid public. In the aftermath of Britain&apos;s own brush with Islamist terror a couple of years ago, the true colours of Londoners shone through, as suspicion and anger swept through a city hurt and confused that such atrocities could take place so close to home. From what I gather on my brief sorties back to the motherland, that mood is still present, although far diluted from what it was in the aftermath of 7/7. So to then blame Israelis for reacting to their lot with similar paranoia smacks of duplicity and double standards - and doesn&apos;t help move things forward in the slightest. Sharing the teeming streets of Finsbury Park on Wednesday night with fellow supporters of all creeds and colours, I also realised quite how hermetically sealed Israelis are from those of other nationalities. I was shocked to find myself instinctively on edge when I saw two women walk past me clad in burkas, assuming that I - as a born and bred cosmopolitan Londoner - wouldn&apos;t bat an eyelid at any kind of religious garb being sported. But that just goes to show how quickly the Israeli mindset takes hold. Israel might be full of people from every corner of the earth - from Iraq to Ethiopia, Belarus and beyond - but the difference is that they&apos;re all Jews, and thus seen as no threat whatsoever to whoever passes them by. Familiarity might breed contempt, but it also helps destroy prejudices if applied in an all-encompassing way, something that the average Israeli has been deprived of after years of being kept apart from their non-Jewish peers. One of the more salient pieces of graffiti on the Bethlehem section of the security wall bears the legend &quot;fear builds walls&quot;, which may be trite but is also an important lesson to those who have allowed their trepidation to literally interpret the slogan&apos;s message. While I understand the circumstances that allowed such a divisive structure to be erected, I believe it to be an utterly counterproductive measure for precisely the reasons that London&apos;s open-door policy is not. Sitting amongst 60,000 Arsenal fans in total calm and relaxation (draconian smoking ban notwithstanding) as the team cruised to a 3-0 win over Sparta Prague, I found myself yearning for the liberty of my formative years on London&apos;s streets. For all the hysteria over gun crime, stabbings, illegal immigration and the rest, there is a freedom afforded to those resident in the capital that Israelis would, or should, love to enjoy themselves. However, for obvious reasons, that isn&apos;t likely to happen any time soon. And, while the situation remains as tense and volatile as it is in the region, it would do people on the outside well to try and imagine what it&apos;s like for Israelis to have to live under such fear - and not just empathise with the plight of the Palestinians when looking for someone to feel sorry for.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-31T11:15:00Z", "title": "Paradise lost", "sentences": ["As I sit staring out of my window at a typically grey and overcast London sky, I&apos;m already counting down the days till I&apos;m once more lounging on the golden beaches of Tel Aviv, or kicking back in the sun-bleached Jerusalem parks."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/31/paradiselost"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Everton", "Europa League", "Uefa Cup 2007-08"], "article": "Everton were paired with Ukrainian outfit Metalist Kharkiv in the draw for the first round of the Uefa Cup.

Not only have injuries hit some of his key players, but he will be up against Dror Kashtan, the Israeli Sir Alex Ferguson. Kashtan is the man, Israelis hope, who will take them to their first major championships since they joined Uefa in the early 1990s. The 63-year-old is the most successful coach in Israeli history, with six league titles - with four different clubs - and five State Cup wins. He is fiercely competitive, can often appear grumpy and is certainly not averse to using the hairdryer treatment on his players. Like Ferguson, Kashtan is a disciplinarian who has very little time for players who do not share his commitment. When Yaniv Katan and Michael Zandberg missed internationals with injury then appeared for their clubs soon afterwards, they were dropped. Another player was omitted, according to the coach, because he was &apos;not trying hard enough&apos; in training. &apos;I am not afraid of challenges,&apos; he said when asked about facing England, Croatia and Russia in qualifying Group E. &apos;I am filled with adrenaline and willpower to face this challenge and the level of expectations - to guide Israel to its first major achievement in 36 years.&apos; Israel took part in the 1970 World Cup finals but belonged to the Asian Football Confederation then, which made qualifying easier. In their first European qualifying campaign - for the 1994 World Cup - they won only one out of 10 games and conceded 27 goals. But the team improved under the guidance of Shlomo Scharf, who guided them to the Euro 2000 play-offs. The last time around, in qualifying for Germany 2006, they did not lose a game, drawing in France, Ireland and Switzerland and missing out on the play-offs only because they had scored fewer goals than the Swiss. They are no longer overawed and come to Wembley confident of getting at least a draw. Kashtan is a more attacking coach than his predecessor, Avraham Grant, now director of football at Chelsea, and on Saturday can call on Roberto Colautti, the Argentina-born striker who was suspended for England&apos;s dire 0...#8209;0 draw in Tel Aviv in March. He joined Maccabi Haifa from Boca Juniors in 2004, becoming the league&apos;s top scorer in his first season and was granted citizenship after marrying his Israeli girlfriend. He scored the only goal of the game eight minutes into his international debut, last September&apos;s qualifying win in Estonia. The star and captain of the team is Liverpool&apos;s Yossi Benayoun. &apos;I have played for the national team for quite some time now and it is an honour trying to help the younger players come through and improve. We have a good team,&apos; says the 27-year-old, who impressed in his club&apos;s Champions League qualifying win against Toulouse on Tuesday. England also have to look out for the 19-year-old Nigeria-born Toto Tamuz, who caused England severe problems down the right in March and Chelsea&apos;s forward Ben Sahar. The 18-year-old is on loan at Queen&apos;s Park Rangers and after four international appearances has already scored twice. Two other players - Chelsea&apos;s Tal Ben Haim and Deportivo La Coruna&apos;s goalkeeper Dudu Aouate - stand out, but otherwise most of the players come from the Israeli league. The domestic competition has not substantially improved despite the continued investment of Beitar Jerusalem owner Arkady Gaydamak - the father of Portsmouth proprietor Alexandre Gaydamak - and his competitors. Beitar could not get past the second qualifying round in the Champions League and Maccabi Tel Aviv&apos;s failure was even more spectacular - they lost to Turkish second-division side Erciyesspor in the second qualifying round of the Uefa Cup. England should win against Israel, but matters are rarely that straightforward under McClaren.

McClaren could never understand the minority who booed Lampard at Wembley last month and a glance at the England stats shows why. Of the current squad, only Michael Owen has scored more England goals and the torn thigh muscle Lampard suffered in training with Chelsea on Friday means the England manager has had to rip up a plan to build an attacking five-man midfield around him. With Gerrard nursing a toe injury, Peter Crouch suspended for Saturday&apos;s fixture against Israel and Owen, Andrew Johnson, Alan Smith and Jermain Defoe all struggling to hit form for their clubs, the normally reliable Lampard was to have been England&apos;s gamebreaker. When asked what Lampard brought to the England party, McClaren summed up his importance in a single word. &apos;Goals,&apos; was his reply. That might sound a little desperate - Lampard has scored 13 times in 56 appearances - though given the sickliness of McClaren&apos;s orthodox attacking options he deserves credit for recognising England are in a desperate situation. They cannot afford any more mistakes and McClaren is right to realise that goals have to come from somewhere. With Lampard unavailable, the onus will fall on a barely fit Gerrard, since goals are unlikely to be delivered by Owen Hargreaves, though now there are likely to be two strikers in the front line instead of just one. England could probably have done without a holding midfielder against Israel had Lampard and Gerrard both been available, but McClaren was planning to play all three of his &apos;big match players&apos; on the grounds that there is no substitute for experience. &apos;We&apos;ve got something in mind for the Israel game, we know how they will play and we know what we have to do,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;We have to score, first and foremost, otherwise we can&apos;t win. When the big games come around, the ones you must win, you need your big players to step forward and deliver.&apos; McClaren was talking about Gerrard and Lampard here, though now Joe Cole must also bring his not inconsiderable experience to bear. In the absence of Wayne Rooney and David Beckham, and with Owen still to prove he can be the spearhead he once was, England currently have no bigger players. Certainly not attacking ones, and McClaren is aware England will have to take the game to Israel and be prepared to break down a 10-man defence. Lampard scored England&apos;s only goal against Germany; Gerrard missed the friendly after playing for Liverpool three days earlier with a pain-killing injection, though he has not appeared for his club since. McClaren is prepared to incur Rafa Benitez&apos;s displeasure by playing Gerrard if at all possible, although even the Liverpool manager acknowledges his captain wants to play, and while the doctors will make the final decision, a showdown is unlikely. Dropped points at home to Macedonia and away to Croatia and Israel could mean England have to win all five of their remaining games to qualify for Austria and Switzerland next year. Other results might simplify that equation slightly before the end of the campaign, though England certainly have to pick up nine points from the three consecutive home games before the trip to Russia in October - Israel and Russia this month and Estonia four weeks later. McClaren is relaxed about the prospect, much more relaxed than he appeared in Tel Aviv and Barcelona, where England played Andorra, six months ago. &apos;One of the things I&apos;ve learned is that you have to trust the players,&apos; he explained. &apos;There might be twists and turns to come but the bottom line is that we have to win our home games. That&apos;s not really pressure, it&apos;s what you&apos;re in the game for. I want the players to relish it, use it as a positive. When I worked with Sir Alex Ferguson all he used to say every season was that he wanted to be in contention when it mattered, when the last 10 league games came around. We are in that position now. The big games are here, and we are in contention. I&apos;ve been looking forward to these games. These are what will count.&apos; It would be possible to take issue with this statement and point out that, actually, the games already played against Macedonia and Israel counted for just as much, but McClaren wants to feel the whole country will be behind England at Wembley and disloyalty would not be appreciated at this juncture. &apos;Everybody&apos;s main aim is the same, it is massively important that England qualify,&apos; he said. &apos;We all want the same thing, so I hope the fans are fully behind us at Wembley. I&apos;ve been involved with England for six years and travelled to plenty of countries where passionate support for the home side makes it very intimidating for the visitors. There is no reason why Wembley cannot be like that. It should not be the case that opponents look forward to playing at Wembley.&apos; In his heart of hearts McClaren must be aware that from a fans&apos; point of view the new Wembley has become more soulless and corporate than the old, while from a playing perspective the elegant renovation cannot help but invite visitors to raise their game. But full marks for trying. A coach who was bitterly abused by his own fans in Barcelona deserves a break in his first competitive game at the new stadium. He is owed a decent performance by a few of his players too, not least Rio Ferdinand, unimpressive again against Germany. &apos;Rio has the potential to be one of the best players in the world in his position,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;There&apos;s quite a few in the squad you could say that about. What we need right now is for them to step up and deliver.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-02T22:36:04Z", "title": "Gerrard is England fallback", "sentences": ["McClaren is relaxed about the prospect, much more relaxed than he appeared in Tel Aviv and Barcelona, where England played Andorra, six months ago."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/02/newsstory.sport3"}, {"tags": ["Iraq", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Abdul-Rahman Aref, who has died aged 91, was last president of Iraq (1966-68) before the Ba&apos;athists, led by Saddam Hussein (obituary, January 1 2007), took power. Given the 35 years of generally brutal rule that followed, observers might see his era as a halcyon age, but it hardly felt blissful at the time. Aref, wrote Syrian analyst Sami Moubayed, was &quot;the weakest president ever to rule Iraq since the officers came to power in 1958 - a harmless (leader) who tried to befriend everybody, Nasserist Egypt, Ba&apos;athist Syria, the United States and the Soviet Union&quot;. During his presidency he battled to maintain control. Initially, he favoured democratisation, but resorted to draconian measures when rivals threatened his position and he lacked a firm base beyond the army. Even there, he found himself bereft of friends. When defence minister Hardan al-Tikriti telephoned a still dozing Aref to tell him that he was no longer president in the early hours of July 17 1968, he offered little resistance. Two of Aref&apos;s once trusted colleagues immediately assumed power: Ibrahim al-Dawud, head of the republican guard, and Abdul-Razzaq al-Nayif, chief of military intelligence. A fortnight later they were ousted; Ba&apos;ath party operatives, their co-conspirators in the first coup, now installed Hassan Ahmad Bakr as president with his younger cousin Saddam as deputy. The 1968 coups were dubbed the &quot;white revolution&quot; because they were, initially, bloodless. Aref slipped into exile unharmed; by contrast some of his colleagues were later reportedly tortured to death at Abu Ghraib. He flew to London where his ailing wife was being treated, and then settled in Turkey. There he remained until returning to Iraq in 1979 - the same year Saddam assumed full power. In many respects Abdul-Rahman Aref was an unlikely ruler. He came to office after the president, his mercurial younger brother, Abdul-Salam Aref, died in a helicopter crash in April 1966. Abdul-Salam - who once called Iraq &quot;a factory for coups d&apos;\u00e9tat&quot; - had survived at least six attempted rebellions, so it was quite possible that sabotage was involved. Two other candidates were bidding for the job: defence minister General Abdul-Aziz Uqaili, who dreamt of crushing rebellious Kurds; and Iraq&apos;s debonair prime minister, Abdul-Rahman Bazzaz, who distrusted pan-Arabism and favoured a mixed economy. At Egypt&apos;s instigation, both men withdrew in the second ballot of a civilian election, and the milder-mannered Abdul-Rahman Aref was returned unopposed. Concerned over his inexperience, he reappointed Bazzaz, a seasoned diplomat and former law school dean, as premier. But the army forced Bazzaz to resign in September 1966, and Aref replaced him with the anti-British retired general and Sandhurst graduate, Naji Taleb. Aref was born in 1916, and Abdul-Salam five years later. Their father was a Sunni textiles trader in Baghdad. A coterie of Hashemite royals, grand merchants and feudal landlords dominated Iraq then; for ambitious boys of humble background, the army offered one of the few paths for advancement. Both brothers studied at Baghdad Military College, and in 1957 joined the clandestine &quot;free officers&quot; movement. They wished to emulate Gamal Abdul Nasser&apos;s similarly named Egyptian cabal, which had unseated King Farouk in 1952. Their opportunity came in July 1958: ordered to back King Hussein in Jordan, Abdul-Salam instead marched his troops into Baghdad, where they killed King Faisal II, the regent, Abdul-Ilah, and virtually all the royal family. Street crowds dismembered the unpopular premier, Nuri Sa&apos;id. Abdul-Salam and his populist co-plotter, Abdul-Karim Qasim, quickly jettisoned the Baghdad Pact that tied Iraq to Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Britain. But Qasim resented Abdul-Salam for favouring union with Egypt, and fired his deputy after he brandished a gun in his office. Biding their time, the brothers joined Ba&apos;athists in arresting, and killing, Qasim within a day in February 1963. Abdul-Salam became nominal president, and Abdul-Rahman a divisional commander. After months of anarchy, fighting between Ba&apos;athists and Communist party members, and a hopeless war against Kurdish pershmerga guerrillas, in November, Abdul-Salam ousted the civilian radicals. He appointed Abdul-Rahman his acting army chief of staff, and later made him ambassador to Moscow. In September 1965, with his brother in Morocco for an Arab League summit, Abdul-Rahman Aref won plaudits for blocking a coup attempt by Iraq&apos;s Nasserist prime minister, Aref Abdul-Razzaq. As president himself after 1966 he advocated &quot;careful socialism&quot;, and in 1967 inaugurated the much-praised Iraq Museum. Unlike Abdul-Salam, who loathed non-Sunnis, he promised Kurds, his &quot;blood brothers&quot;, limited autonomy. However, peasants were angered when he froze agrarian reforms, and democrats peeved when he delayed long-promised elections. Iraq&apos;s economy stagnated after a pricing dispute led Syria to block Iraqi oil exports from Syrian ports. Abdul-Razzaq, meanwhile, tried twice more to take power. In the fervour that preceded the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Abdul-Rahman Aref vowed to &quot;wipe Israel off the map&quot; and overturn &quot;the ignominy&quot; of 1948. &quot;God willing we will meet soon in Tel Aviv and Haifa,&quot; he told troops with unwonted passion. In the event, he hardly had time to commit them to battle. Baghdad crowds rose in revolt after the devastating defeat of June 5-13. Having made himself prime minister in May, he transferred that post to Tahir Yahya - another blunder, as the corrupt Yahya was deemed the &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;. Aref kept a low profile in Iraq after 1979 and moved to Jordan following the American-led invasion of 2003. In a rare interview last year, he urged Iraqis to forget the past, strive for national unity and look to the future. After he died, the current Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, hailed Aref as a &quot;model of integrity and tolerance&quot;. Aref&apos;s sister, Sabiha, was killed in 2004 by flying glass when a car bomb exploded near her Baghdad home. He is survived by his wife Faiqa, two sons and three daughters. \u00b7  Abdul-Rahman Aref, politician, born 1916; died August 24 2007", "publicationDate": "2007-09-03T23:03:48Z", "title": "Obituary: Abdul-Rahman Aref", "sentences": ["&quot;God willing we will meet soon in Tel Aviv and Haifa,&quot; he told troops with unwonted passion."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/04/guardianobituaries.iraq"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Israel&apos;s coach, Dror Kashtan, yesterday revealed the squad that will arrive in England today for Saturday&apos;s crucial Euro 2008 qualifier, but admitted that he was expecting defeat. &quot;Any result other than a loss will be one of the greatest achievements for Israeli soccer,&quot; he said.

Whose fault is it? Is it my fault?&apos; &quot;I love playing for England - that feeling you get when you have had your first call-up never diminishes for me - but I&apos;ve been frustrated ever since I&apos;ve been in the squad because I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve fulfilled our potential. We&apos;ve never brought our club form together as a unit. Every manager I&apos;ve been involved with has been trying to find an answer and up to now has not been able to pin it down. This manager is trying to do that and he&apos;s working in the right direction.&quot; The next week may go a long way towards deciding whether the course Steve McClaren has plotted takes England to the European Championship. Pivotal qualifiers await against Israel and Russia at Wembley, starting tomorrow, with points to be made up if the initial group favourites are to clamber out of fourth place. Both opponents perch above them at present. For those in England&apos;s patched-up side, and for Ferdinand in particular, the time is ripe to prove their underlying pedigree. The centre-half has 60 caps but he was not selected for Euro 2000 and missed Euro 2004 while serving a ban for missing a routine drug test, and his place in the first-choice side has come under some scrutiny in recent weeks. He was substituted at half-time in the recent friendly defeat to Germany suffering from a groin injury but his presence alongside the captain, John Terry - an &quot;untouchable&quot; with the management of club and country - too often magnifies his every error, however slight. Jamie Carragher&apos;s retirement from international football and Micah Richards&apos; emergence have similarly thrust more focus on the United defender&apos;s form. For the 28-year-old the consequences of failing to reach the tournament in Austria and Switzerland are unthinkable. &quot;The players feel it is win or bust as well,&quot; he says. &quot;If we, God forbid, failed to qualify for this tournament it would be a catastrophe really - a massive disappointment for the country itself and the fans - and I can&apos;t even contemplate not qualifying. If we didn&apos;t get there I&apos;d go underground. I&apos;d be devastated. I wouldn&apos;t watch any games on telly, and even walking into the training ground at United and seeing the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson, a proud Scot] would kill me. &quot;But it&apos;s been reiterated a few times that it is in our hands: with four games out of five at home, we couldn&apos;t ask to be in a better position in terms of the games to come. My mind-set is all about qualifying. I&apos;ve been to a few World Cups but, if we get there, the European Championship would be a real opportunity for this generation of players. &quot;In the tournaments I&apos;ve always done quite well. I&apos;ve done what has been asked of me. In qualifying and the friendlies there can be indifferent performances but, in the main, in an England shirt I&apos;ve never let my country down. &quot;But I&apos;d love it if, at the end, we were able to hold our heads up high and say we achieved something with England. Each individual in this squad can play fantastic football for their club. &quot;We need to bring that into the England team and generate the kind of confidence we have in our club football. You can&apos;t do that overnight, but we&apos;re working in the right direction.&quot; It has been something of a crawl. In the decade since Ferdinand made his debut as a substitute against Cameroon the side have consistently flattered to deceive at major tournaments even if qualifying has been achieved relatively smoothly. Now, though, with Croatia, Russia and Israel above them, even that has been reduced to a stuttering process. The Israelis will shuffle out at Wembley intent upon stifling as they did in Tel Aviv in March, their objective apparently no more than a draw which, they insist, would represent a major achievement. That in itself is worrying given the loss of Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney, David Beckham and Peter Crouch. &quot;They will play with their backs against the wall all game and it will be up to us to break them down,&quot; adds Ferdinand. &quot;They&apos;re quite a resolute team. They showed in Israel they&apos;re good at defending and putting their bodies on the line, and they have some experienced players. They know what it&apos;s like to try to grind out a result. But we know what we have to do. The pressure is on to get results. Results are more important than performances and we have to go out there and produce. That&apos;s the be all and end all. We have to put our stamp on things.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-06T23:05:44Z", "title": "If we miss out I won't be watching it, says Ferdinand", "sentences": ["The Israelis will shuffle out at Wembley intent upon stifling as they did in Tel Aviv in March, their objective apparently no more than a draw which, they insist, would represent a major achievement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/07/newsstory.sport1"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea"], "article": "Tal Ben Haim will be in familiar company at Wembley tomorrow evening but the Israel centre-half has warned his Chelsea team-mates to expect no favours in their attempt to advance England&apos;s campaign to qualify for Euro 2008.

Steve McClaren felt that chill in the years beside Sven-Goran Eriksson and he understands the bleakness to come if his team should fail in today&apos;s match with Israel or Wednesday&apos;s game against Russia. It is conceivable for England to win a couple of matches at Wembley, but McClaren&apos;s brief time in the post has left him exposed and doubted. That long period as Eriksson&apos;s sidekick has barely been of help and the comparison with his predecessor is dismaying. The Swede took England to two World Cups and a European Championship by dropping a mere 11 points out of a possible 72. McClaren has let slip seven already and his side have another five Euro 2008 qualifiers yet to negotiate. In theory Group E should not be fiendish, but the whole experience must be torturous to McClaren. After all, he was 40 by the time he got his first job as a manager, at Middlesbrough in 2001. While he had been good enough as a coach to earn the respect of a curmudgeon like Roy Keane, promotion has sometimes taxed him. Jim Smith, who played a significant part in McClaren&apos;s rise by making him his assistant at Derby County in 1995, has noticed the novelty of the younger man&apos;s situation. &quot;I&apos;ve told him myself,&quot; said Smith, &quot;that in a funny kind of a way he became a club manager a little late and an international manager a bit too early. You&apos;d be better doing that job when you&apos;re in your sixties.&quot; McClaren comes across as being uneasy with his vertiginously public role and, on a bad day, his press conference remarks are a daisy chain of motivational slogans. All of that would be an irrelevance if results had not deteriorated under McClaren. It would be dishonest now to reimagine Eriksson as a virtuoso, but he did possess credentials far beyond those of his successor. The strength of McClaren&apos;s candidacy lay purely in the comparison with his own countrymen. By winning the League Cup in 2004 he became the first English manager of a Premier League club to land a trophy since Brian Little&apos;s Aston Villa won the same competition eight years before. There is a debate to be had about McClaren&apos;s record. How come, with Steve Gibson spending energetically, he only got Middlesbrough into the top half of the table once in five seasons? Does the clobbering by Sevilla in the 2006 Uefa Cup final devalue the helter-skelter adventure of the previous rounds? McClaren himself embodies uncertainty. He began his England tenure with idealism as he paid off some members of the old guard, such as David James, Sol Campbell and David Beckham. That left him open to derision when he started to reinstate them. It would, in reality, be fairer to say that he discovered the England job to be tough enough without trying to incorporate visions and ideals. For much of his career, McClaren had the luxury of thinking about football without being held accountable for results. Jim Smith jokes that he was first impressed by his future assistant when McClaren was pouring him a glass of red wine in the office of Oxford United&apos;s then caretaker manager Maurice Evans. McClaren evidently had more to offer than that. He went from working with reserves and youth players to receiving considerable credit at Derby County as the club reached the Premier League and settled there for a period. A reputation for innovation was earned and his interest in the emerging technology of ProZone ensured he was known as a bright spark. Sir Alex Ferguson gave much thought to the replacement for Brian Kidd at Old Trafford and two months elapsed before McClaren began working as his assistant in February 1999. From then until the summer of 2001, United won, among other things, three Premier League titles and the Champions League. It is only fair to assume that McClaren&apos;s efforts in the background and on the training field were important to those achievements. &quot;Football doesn&apos;t get much bigger than it was at United then,&quot; argues Smith, scoffing at the suggestion that England duties might be overwhelming for McClaren. The true issue, none the less, was whether he could extend that accomplishment when he alone was accountable for results. His record at Middlesbrough is ambiguous. Indeed, he had to pull off a remarkable recovery to survive as a candidate for the post of England manager. During that season Boro lost 7-0 at Arsenal and a fan marched towards the dug-out during the 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa in February to throw away his season ticket. It looked likelier that McClaren would be dismissed rather than promoted as Eriksson&apos;s heir. A week later at the Riverside, Chelsea were trounced 3-0. That is the sole occasion in Jose Mourinho&apos;s reign that any English club has scored three times against his side in the league. Some put Middlesbrough&apos;s feat down to the eloquence of McClaren in motivating the team and others, in a more grudging interpretation, handed the credit to the influence of senior players. Whatever the cause, there had been a spectacular recovery and Middlesbrough went on to an FA Cup semi-final as well as the Uefa Cup final. If he hopes to remain England manager McClaren needs to show in the next few days that the transformation of 2006 was no fluke.

Bobby turned to me and said: &apos;At least that will keep people quiet until the next one.&apos; In other words you live by your results. Steve&apos;s side will find it difficult to overcome the negative atmosphere. If you compare England&apos;s squad to those of Israel and Russia on paper, most would agree England have the better chance. But that&apos;s on paper, and paper teams win paper cups.

If England drop any more points their chances of qualifying for Austria and Switzerland look very, very remote. Six points must be taken, especially at home. I say this with the experience of 1994, when we failed to qualify for the World Cup. Everybody says it was away to Norway and to Holland that we blew our chances, but it wasn&apos;t; it was the points dropped by drawing with them both at Wembley. Against Norway we dominated but drew 1-1, and against the Dutch we drew 2-2, having been 2-0 up. England have already dropped points against Macedonia, Croatia and Israel and if they drop any more then I think the Russia away game next month, which people are billing as pivotal, could be irrelevant.

All three were quality strikes, the scorers offered a pleasing mix of youth and experience and this was certainly the most impressive England performance in a competitive game under McClaren. That said, Israel were so poor you wondered how they ever managed to come to Wembley in second place in the group and how England could work themselves into such a state about having to beat them.  A few more results like this and McClaren might have the &apos;Fortress Wembley&apos; he desires, though it would be wise not to get carried away until Wednesday, when Guus Hiddink&apos;s Russia can hardly fail to be more threatening opponents. &apos;I expected a tough game, but our players made Israel look ordinary,&apos; was McClaren&apos;s explanation. There might be a more prosaic one, though genuine highlights for England included the performances of all three goalscorers as well as Emile Heskey and Gareth Barry mounting convincing cases for staying in the team.  McClaren had appealed for fervently patriotic backing, and the fans before kick-off responded enthusiastically. Every England player&apos;s name brought a deafening cheer, even Heskey&apos;s, and there was a particularly approving roar for Steven Gerrard.  When Owen Hargreaves failed his fitness test Barry found himself in the middle of midfield alongside Gerrard, with the task of keeping an eye on Walid Badir and Yossi Benayoun. There is no doubt the Barry deserved his chance, only players of the quality of Gerrard, Hargreaves and Frank Lampard ahead have him have restricted the international appearances of one of the Premiership&apos;s most consistent and capable players.  Gerrard was prominent from the start, launching 40-yard passes towards Wright-Phillips, who reached the dropping ball better than he controlled it. England&apos;s first chance arrived after 10 minutes when, in a reversal of the intended order, Michael Owen knocked the ball back for Heskey. The finish showed why it might have been better the other way round. Israel were not doing much attacking, but when Joe Cole gave the ball away with the England cover stretched Richards needed all his pace to come to the rescue.  The goal England needed to take the pressure off themselves and force Israel to come out and play came just before the middle of the first half and, after Gerrard and Heskey had threatened from set- pieces, was a well-worked opportunity from open play. The two Coles combined cleverly on the left, Ashley racing forward and committing two defenders in flicking the ball back for Joe, who steadied himself through a challenge and had the awareness to pick out Wright-Phillips&apos; run into the box with a perfectly flighted cross. Having timed his run carefully to stay onside, Wright-Phillips was just as precise with his finish, volleying past Dudu Aouate for his first competitive England goal.  Owen was unable to be quite as lethal from an even more promising position on 37 minutes when with only Aouate to beat he needed two attempts and hit the goalkeeper both times. England were piling on the pressure in the minutes before the interval, perhaps mindful that one goal was insufficient reflection of their superiority and missed chances had cost them in Tel Aviv.  Perhaps McClaren said as much in the dressing room at half time, for England came out and scored a second goal to kill the game four minutes after the restart. Or rather Israel invited them to do so, first standing back in admiration as Heskey anchored himself in their half and brought down a high ball without a hint of a challenge, then standing off Barry as he surveyed his passing options 10 yards from the edge of the area. Nothing was moving for Barry at first, though he was allowed so long he spotted a chink of light and played a low pass forward to Owen, whose smart turn and alert eye for goal did the rest. Israel discovered the price for defending on the 18-yard line is being picked off from the 18-yard line by a master sniper.  The visitors&apos; defending was also questionable for England&apos;s third goal, when the only competition Richards faced in leaping to meet Barry&apos;s corner was Heskey, though Aouate, who was booked for complaining, did seem to have a point in suggesting he was impeded by Owen. Heskey and Gerrard departed shortly after that, both to huge applause, the latter limping slightly after taking another bang on the foot.  There was almost a second for Owen four minutes from the end, as a result of a lightning break by Andy Johnson, but Yoav Ziv got back in time to clear his goalbound effort off the line. Four goals would not have flattered England, and three brought a welcome boost to the goal difference. Talking of which, Paul Robinson had next to nothing to do, when he might have preferred to make a save or two to redeem himself. Israel have somehow amassed 17 points from nine games without having the nous to at least test a goalkeeper supposed to be a bag of nerves. If Robinson is as comfortable on Wednesday night, England will have taken a significant step towards Austria and Switzerland.

The group of eight Russian immigrants aged between 18 and 21 appeared in court following an 18-month investigation into attacks on two synagogues in which swastikas were painted on the walls of the buildings. The men covered their heads with their shirts during the hearing, revealing arms tattooed with Nazi imagery. More than a million people from the former Soviet Union have emigrated to Israel, which has a population of seven million, since 1990, taking advantage of Israel&apos;s Law of Return which allows anyone to claim citizenship if they have a Jewish grandparent. Many of the new immigrants have little connection to Judaism and emigrated for economic reasons. Many Russians live in large communities in Israel&apos;s cities in which they have little interaction with other Israelis. They have their own supermarkets where pork is available, unlike in the majority of stores. Russians feel they are victims of discrimination in Israel and many are denied the right to marry by the Jewish authorities. Police named the leader of the neo-Nazi gang as Eli Boanitov, 19, from Petah Tikvah, a city next to Tel Aviv. Boanitov, who was known as &quot;Eli the Nazi&quot;, told police: &quot;I won&apos;t ever give up. I was a Nazi and I will stay a Nazi, until we kill them all I will not rest.&quot; In one conversation recorded by the police, Boanitov tells one of his fellow gang members: &quot;My grandfather was a half-Jewboy. I will not have children so that this trash will not be born with even a tiny per cent of Jewboy blood.&quot; During the investigation, police seized video recordings of the suspects attacking foreign workers. One of the videos shows the gang members attacking a Russian drug addict, striking him until he bled and forcing him to ask forgiveness of the Russian people for being a Jewish drug addict. The search also revealed photographs of the suspects wearing Nazi clothing, using the Nazi salute and calling for the burning of Jews. Explosive materials were found in the home of one of the suspects. Police also found recordings of conversations between gang members, in one they planned how to celebrate the F\u00fchrer&apos;s birthday, and in another they planned a Nazi ceremony at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. The Anti Defamation League, a New York-based group that fights anti-Semitism, praised the arrest of the neo-Nazis but warned Israelis not to stigmatise the whole Russian community for the actions of a few members. &quot;The suspicion that immigrants to Israel could have been acting in praise of Nazis and Hitler is anathema to the Jewish state and is to be repelled,&quot; the organisation said in a statement. &quot;Members of the group were reportedly from the former Soviet Union and were religiously identified as Christians. &quot;They were allowed to immigrate to Israel on the basis of law of return which grants even grandchildren of Jews sanctuary in the Jewish state. &quot;The tragic irony in this is that they would have been chosen for annihilation by the Nazis they strive to emulate.&quot; The ADL said that the phenomenon appeared to be marginal and was more a reaction to anti-Russian discrimination in Israel. Israeli politicians reacted with anger to the revelations and proposed several changes in the law to prevent a repeat of neo-Nazi actions. Effi Eitam of the National Religious Party said he would propose a bill in the Knesset that would restrict the rights of non-Jews to emigrate to Israel. Ahmed Tibi, an Arab Israeli member of the Knesset, said that the case illustrated the absurdity of Israeli laws which give extensive rights to newcomers from Russia while denying them to Arab residents who had lived in the region for generations.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-09T23:04:18Z", "title": "Israeli neo-Nazi ring caught after attacks on synagogues", "sentences": ["Police named the leader of the neo-Nazi gang as Eli Boanitov, 19, from Petah Tikvah, a city next to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/10/israel.internationalcrime"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "For most England followers Saturday&apos;s facile victory over a dismally negative Israel made for a pleasant spectacle.

Now, however, with England&apos;s qualifying campaign reaching its endgame and both recuperating from injury, they face permanent displacement by a young duo whose careers were developed across Manchester in City&apos;s sky blue. McClaren has been here before of course. He tried to break the Neville-Beckham duopoly when he succeeded Sven-Goran Eriksson, dropping Beckham from his first squad claiming the former captain did not satisfy his new priorities of pace and width. Within a year it looked an empty gesture as several potential successors including Wright-Phillips failed to establish themselves. Beckham was recalled in June, apparently certain to fulfil his ambition of 100 England caps. Three months on and stalled on 97 caps he cannot be so sure. A knee injury is expected to keep him out until mid-October when McClaren will announce his squad for the qualifiers against Estonia and Russia, leaving November&apos;s tie against Croatia as the final competitive game ahead of Euro 2008. Should Beckham miss that too his prospects of travelling to the finals may rest on his value as a squad player. Neville&apos;s prognosis is not quite so bleak - he is expected to return to training later this month - but while a berth in the squad is not seriously in question his place in the starting XI is. The reason, simply, is that Wright-Phillips and Richards have seized their chance. They were at the heart of England&apos;s best competitive performance under McClaren, providing dynamism and an attacking threat, and aged only 25 and 19 respectively they have the opportunity to monopolise the positions to the 2010 World Cup and beyond. Wright-Phillips was a constant menace to Yoav Ziv, providing a steady supply of chances to Michael Owen and Emile Heskey. If Wright-Phillips&apos;s performance was that of a player who has taken time to acclimatise to international football, Richards&apos;s was that of a prodigy. He appears utterly unfazed by the step up and, as he did when playing with Beckham against Germany last month, spent almost as much time beyond his winger as he did in support. And the few times he had to deal with Israel attacks he did so with ease. McClaren, at last enjoying the luxury of competition for Beckham&apos;s place, was delighted with Wright-Phillips and equally effusive about Richards. Worryingly for Neville he did not list the Manchester United club captain among the five &quot;major players&quot; that were missing at the weekend. &quot;You always get a feeling from the first day of training,&quot; he said of Richards. &quot;You can tell whether you have a character. Can they handle the occasion? Can they mix well? Have they got the character?.&quot; Rio Ferdinand backed up his manager&apos;s praise for Wright-Phillips. &quot;At the moment Shaun is probably the most important player going forward in the Premier League. He is playing very well for his club and bringing that on to the international scene as well.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-09T23:55:40Z", "title": "Thriving right-side blend threatens Neville and Beckham partnership", "sentences": ["Fluid and well-balanced, Steve McClaren&apos;s side were unrecognisable from the XI whose lumpen display against the same opponents in Tel Aviv contributed so much to their perilous position in Group E.

This week was no exception, but, as the pendulum swings from hostility to detente and back again on the political level, the people on the street are less keen on conflict than those who represent them. At least, not if the quartet of artists I met recently in Tel Aviv is anything to go by. Coming together under the banner of a &quot;peace delegation to Syria&quot;, the group has recently returned from a trip to the Syrian embassy in Amman, Jordan, where they applied for entry visas, in the hope of becoming the first Israelis to set foot legally on Syrian soil. Sitting in a local cafe and swigging from bottles of malt beer, the foursome grew more and more animated as they enthused about their mission for rapprochement between the &quot;ordinary folk&quot; on both sides of the divide. &quot;Our optimism is infectious,&quot; declared Chicky, and it appears his assessment is spot on, given the amount of media interest the group&apos;s plans have attracted. Members of the delegation were interviewed on national television and managed to convince one of their sceptical hosts that their campaign was far more than the pie-in-the-sky dreaming of starry-eyed youngsters, to the point that he asked if he could accompany them on their journey. Another member of the group, Ari Libsker, had to overcome resistance from closer to home. &quot;When my father saw us on TV and realised how serious we were, he told me &apos;you&apos;re not my son anymore&apos;,&quot; laughed Ari. &quot;But he soon came to terms with it, even comparing me to the legendary Abey Natan.&quot; The Natan comparison is not one that the group take lightly. Natan was an Israeli pilot who made a clandestine flight to Egypt to meet with President Nasser, long before the peace deal between the two countries. His two sorties to Cairo airport met with all kinds of hostility from his fellow countrymen, but he later became viewed as one of the most important peace pioneers of his day. As their eyes blazed with righteous zeal at the thought of becoming modern-day Natans themselves, it was clear that these four trailblazers see their quest as just as essential for peace to occur. And, given the current state of play on a diplomatic level between the two nations, the timing of their message of conciliation could not be better. &quot;War is being pushed every day in the media,&quot; said Nimrod Kramer, &quot;so we want to go as soon as possible - it&apos;s the most patriotic thing we can do for our country.&quot; The group are less than enamoured with the Israeli leadership&apos;s sabre-rattling of late. &quot;Look atBarak&apos;s campaign slogan, that he&apos;s the best equipped to lead the country to war,&quot; complained Chicky. &quot;We don&apos;t need leaders like that; we need them to say they&apos;re the best equipped to lead the country to peace.&quot; According to Ari: &quot;It should have been a good thing we lost the war last summer, because it forces us to come to the negotiating table rather than rely on military might.&quot; However, it appears that the still-smarting IDF top brass are now looking for any excuse to flex their military muscle once more and prove their critics wrong, regardless of whether they are acting with the backing of the public. The four of them don&apos;t appear overly concerned about the dangers they could face if they do end up crossing the Syrian border. Syria doesn&apos;t have the best track record in hospitality towards Israelis, but the group are sanguine about how they themselves will go down in Damascus. &quot;I&apos;m certain people will be nice to us on a one to one level,&quot; said Chicky. &quot;Just as I know people who say they &apos;hate&apos; Palestinians, but when they actually hang out with Palestinians in Tel Aviv on an individual basis, they get on famously with them.&quot; Crucial to their plans is keeping it real; meeting the people on the street, and not being trapped in the artificial bubble that more official peace delegations often find themselves in. &quot;Other peace groups stay in five star hotels - castles - and so never meet the real people,&quot; said Nimrod, &quot;whereas we&apos;ll be in five-dinar-a-day hostels, with no barriers to communication.&quot; Chicky agreed: &quot;We don&apos;t want to be in a sterilised atmosphere, with walls, security guards, and so on, because that only encourages the participants to be afraid.&quot; &quot;People ask us if we&apos;re afraid to go,&quot; said Ari, &quot;but that&apos;s because they have been conditioned to see Syrians as devils. They demonise them even more than they do the Palestinians, because at least they&apos;ve had contact with Palestinians, so they are forced to see them as human at least.&quot; For all their optimism, the chances of them actually being granted visas by the Syrian authorities have to be viewed as slim. There is no precedent for such a visit, and the chances are that the Syrians have bigger fish to fry at the moment than dealing with a collective of poets and filmmakers trying to make waves in the Damascus backstreets. However, the mere fact that there are a group of Israelis willing to put their lives on the line to serve their country in a way other than militarily could be just the tonic for those on the Syrian side who have been conditioned to fear Israelis as much as the Israelis fear them. Whether the group become latter-day Abey Natans will depend entirely on the whims of the Syrian visa officials, but - whether they make it or not - there is solace to be taken from their vocal opposition to the road to war that both sides appear determined to march down.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-11T06:00:00Z", "title": "Dreaming of Damascus", "sentences": ["At least, not if the quartet of artists I met recently in Tel Aviv is anything to go by.", "&quot;Just as I know people who say they &apos;hate&apos; Palestinians, but when they actually hang out with Palestinians in Tel Aviv on an individual basis, they get on famously with them.&quot; Crucial to their plans is keeping it real; meeting the people on the street, and not being trapped in the artificial bubble that more official peace delegations often find themselves in."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/11/dreamingofdamascus"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Goodness knows how, given the shambles witnessed in Tel Aviv and Barcelona only six months ago, but England can hold up their heads again in the community of world football. With a second victory in four days, this time over opposition of respectable quality, Steve McClaren&apos;s team have given themselves the opportunity to claim the place that seemed to have been lost in next summer&apos;s Euro 2008 finals. The two head coaches were in the spotlight during the build-up, but it took only seven minutes for last night&apos;s match to provide a reminder that, in the end, it is players who decide football matches. Michael Owen&apos;s ability to get himself into the right place at the right time also paid a rich dividend later in the first half, as he gave England a two-goal lead that was no more than their enterprising attacking deserved. In defence they were a different proposition, at least to start with, and McClaren could have had no complaints if each of his team&apos;s first-half goals had been answered by a Russian score. Steered by Andrei Arshavin, the little No10 from Zenit St Petersburg, Guus Hiddink&apos;s side made early inroads into the home rearguard with disturbing ease.  England refused to be rattled, however, and proceeded to continue the good work begun, to the surprise of many, in last Saturday&apos;s defeat of Israel. Fielding an unchanged side for the first time in two and a half years, McClaren was able to watch a display of assurance in the forward and midfield areas that spoke of the benefits of continuity.  Having deployed three centre-backs to nullify the threat of England&apos;s two strikers, Hiddink must have winced at the amount of time Owen was given to shape his shot for his first goal, and the markers were again absent without leave when he drifted away to await Emile Heskey&apos;s knockdown for his second. This was Owen&apos;s 14th goal in 14 starts alongside Heskey for England, a statistic that would appear to speak for itself - at least until Wayne Rooney raises his voice again. For the moment, Owen is thriving on the reliability of the service provided by the tireless and egoless Heskey, who came close to a goal of his own when Vyacheslav Malafeev smothered his shot after 10 minutes. Owen&apos;s feeling for the geometry of the penalty area and his predatory instinct are clearly back in full working order - and for once a club manager, in this case Newcastle United&apos;s Sam Allardyce, can be thankful for the rehab opportunity provided by a week spent with the national squad. On the assumption that Russia are a decent team, directed by a gifted coach with a rich record of success, then last night&apos;s match appeared to endorse England&apos;s adherence to a simple, comfortable 4-4-2, a formation all their players understand. Russia&apos;s 3-5-1-1 looked fussy and cumbersome everywhere except the final third, where they showed frequent glimpses of quick-footed menace. Their three central midfielders, who might have been expected to outnumber Steven Gerrard and Gareth Barry, were never able to erect an effective barrier. The understanding that ran throughout the various departments of the England team was as impressive as it had been against Israel. Asked after that match about the reunion of Owen and Heskey and about the instant success of the partnership between Gerrard and Barry, McClaren said he thought he had seen the signs of promising two-man combinations throughout the team. That impression was confirmed last night by the duos of Shaun Wright-Phillips and Micah Richards down the right, the two Coles on the left, and - to a lesser extent last night, at least in the opening stages - John Terry and Rio Ferdinand in the centre. One way of building a functioning team is to create a series of linked units, and England currently look closer to that ideal than for several years. When Russia came out and took England on at the start of the second half, the defensive imperfections of McClaren&apos;s side were again exposed. But apart from giving England a nervous moment when he left a back-pass short, Barry&apos;s calmness as he went about the clean-up work was as impressive as it had been four days earlier. So was his dovetailing with Gerrard, which allowed the Liverpool captain to concentrate on breaking forward whenever the opportunity presented itself. The matter of Gerrard&apos;s partnership with Frank Lampard, a failure against strong and weak opposition alike, now looks very much like a dead issue. Gerrard and Barry have played together twice, and succeeded twice. As important as the complement of Barry&apos;s preference for his left foot and Gerrard&apos;s for his right, the combination of temperaments seems to be a natural fit. That should be enough to allow the coach to turn his mind to other matters. After two satisfying wins, England are not suddenly a wunderteam for the new century. This is not the finest collection of players ever to put on the white shirt. But no one can deny that they have become a football team again, a prospect that seemed horrifically remote as they stumbled to a shaming victory against the amateurs of Andorra. Still bruised by that experience, McClaren is unlikely to switch to triumphalist mode just yet, and England&apos;s revived cheerleaders would be well advised to follow his example until the job has been done. Which, at least, now looks a lot more likely.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-13T00:17:04Z", "title": "Richard Williams: Owen's goals lead the way as England become a team again", "sentences": ["Goodness knows how, given the shambles witnessed in Tel Aviv and Barcelona only six months ago, but England can hold up their heads again in the community of world football."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/13/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Money", "Work & careers"], "article": "I&apos;ve always had a soft spot for the England football team. Their inability to win a single tournament since 1966 has turned them into the patron saints of losers. In particular, their loss of a succession of penalty shootouts embodies our collective tendency to fall at the final fence. For people like me - who don&apos;t count themselves among life&apos;s winners - there is something touching and lovable about them. In my book, it is precisely because they never win anything that they are national heroes, up there with Tim Henman and Eddie the Eagle. You can imagine how pleased I was, therefore, when I secured tickets to England&apos;s game against Russia last Wednesday. Not only would I witness England&apos;s failure to qualify for Euro 2008 - as joyous an occasion as the 2-0 defeat to Holland that saw them fail to qualify for the 1994 World Cup - but I would do so at our brand new \u00a3798m stadium. With luck, the first 90 minutes would see no goals and then, in the 91st minute, England would win a penalty which Michael Owen would promptly miss. As England&apos;s &quot;lethal striker&quot; (ha, ha) fell to the ground with a twisted ankle, the rain would fall and 80,000 spectators would start whistling Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. What an evening it would be! I had every reason to be optimistic. In March, I travelled to Tel Aviv to watch England fail to score against a dismal Israeli side. On that occasion, the players - including such colossi as Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Owen Hargreaves - put on such a feeble display that the fans chanted &quot;What a load of rubbish&quot;. If we couldn&apos;t score against a team ranked 38th in the world, what hope did we have against Russia, particularly as Rooney, Lampard and Hargreaves were injured? Steve McClaren certainly filled me with confidence. In Israel, virtually the only &quot;tactical&quot; decision he made was to take off Aaron Lennon. Given that Lennon looked the only player capable of scoring, it was strangely reminiscent of Graham &quot;Turnip&quot; Turner&apos;s decision to substitute Gary Lineker in England&apos;s crucial match against Sweden which saw them crash out of Euro 92. I joined in the chant of &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing&quot;, pleased that our team was now managed by the footballing equivalent of Iain Duncan Smith. Admittedly, we did better against Israel when we played them again last Saturday. Owen had actually managed to score in that game - producing a bona fide &quot;wonder goal&quot; in the 49th minute - but that was surely a fluke. In a strange departure from form, McClaren made the sensible decision to field the same side against Russia. The atmosphere in the stadium as the game got under way was subdued, and I turned to my companion and suggested we start chanting &quot;You&apos;re not fit to wear the shirt&quot; straight away. After all, it was only a matter of time before the team revealed their true colours - a white cross on a white background. Then something remarkable happened. England actually looked like a team. The second-choice players - Emile Heskey, Gareth Barry, Shaun Wright-Phillips - were combining much better than their first-choice counterparts. Thanks to a well-placed pass from Barry, Owen scored in the seventh minute - and then again before half-time. &quot;Watch us go 3-2 down in the second half,&quot; I said as the team trooped into the dressing room - but it wasn&apos;t to be. England continued to cope remarkably well with everything Russia threw at them and even scored a third goal. What on earth has got into the players? Have they no sense of history? It&apos;s beginning to look like England might actually progress to the next stage of the tournament. I&apos;m crestfallen. If McClaren continues to show such good judgment - and the team continue to perform - I&apos;ll have to switch my allegiance to Northern Ireland.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-15T22:54:08Z", "title": "Toby Young on failure", "sentences": ["In March, I travelled to Tel Aviv to watch England fail to score against a dismal Israeli side."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/sep/15/work.workandcareers3"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The head of Israel&apos;s airforce, Major-General Eliezer Shkedi, was visiting a base in the coastal city of Herziliya last week. For the 50-year-old general, also the head of Israel&apos;s Iran Command, which would fight a war with Tehran if ordered, it was a morale-boosting affair, a meet-and-greet with pilots and navigators who had flown during last summer&apos;s month-long war against Lebanon. The journalists who had turned out in large numbers were there for another reason: to question Shkedi about a mysterious air raid that happened this month, codenamed &apos;Orchard&apos;, carried out deep in Syrian territory by his pilots. Shkedi ignored all questions. It set a pattern for the days to follow as he and Israel&apos;s politicians and officials maintained a steely silence, even when the questions came from the visiting French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner. Those journalists who thought of reporting the story were discouraged by the threat of Israel&apos;s military censor. But the rumours were in circulation, not just in Israel but in Washington and elsewhere. In the days that followed, the sketchy details of the raid were accompanied by contradictory claims even as US and British officials admitted knowledge of the raid. The New York Times described the target of the raid as a nuclear site being run in collaboration with North Korean technicians. Others reported that the jets had hit either a Hizbollah convoy, a missile facility or a terrorist camp. Amid the confusion there were troubling details that chimed uncomfortably with the known facts. Two detachable tanks from an Israeli fighter were found just over the Turkish border. According to Turkish military sources, they belonged to a Raam F15I - the newest generation of Israeli long-range bomber, which has a combat range of over 2,000km when equipped with the drop tanks. This would enable them to reach targets in Iran, leading to speculation that it was an &apos;operation rehearsal&apos; for a raid on Tehran&apos;s nuclear facilities. Finally, however, at the week&apos;s end, the first few tangible details were beginning to emerge about Operation Orchard from a source involved in the Israeli operation. They were sketchy, but one thing was absolutely clear. Far from being a minor incursion, the Israeli overflight of Syrian airspace through its ally, Turkey, was a far more major affair involving as many as eight aircraft, including Israel&apos;s most ultra-modern F-15s and F-16s equipped with Maverick missiles and 500lb bombs. Flying among the Israeli fighters at great height, The Observer can reveal, was an ELINT - an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft. What was becoming clear by this weekend amid much scepticism, largely from sources connected with the administration of President George Bush, was the nature of the allegation, if not the facts. In a series of piecemeal leaks from US officials that gave the impression of being co-ordinated, a narrative was laid out that combined nuclear skulduggery and the surviving members of the &apos;axis of evil&apos;: Iran, North Korea and Syria. It also combined a series of neoconservative foreign policy concerns: that North Korea was not being properly monitored in the deal struck for its nuclear disarmament and was off-loading its material to Iran and Syria, both of which in turn were helping to rearm Hizbollah. Underlying all the accusations was a suggestion that recalled the bogus intelligence claims that led to the war against Iraq: that the three countries might be collaborating to supply an unconventional weapon to Hizbollah. It is not only the raid that is odd but also, ironically, the deliberate air of mystery surrounding it, given Israel&apos;s past history of bragging about similar raids, including an attack on an Iraqi reactor. It was a secrecy so tight, in fact, that even as the Israeli aircrew climbed into the cockpits of their planes they were not told the nature of the target they were being ordered to attack. According to an intelligence expert quoted in the Washington Post who spoke to aircrew involved in the raid, the target of the attack, revealed only to the pilots while they were in the air, was a northern Syrian facility that was labelled as an agricultural research centre on the Euphrates river, close to the Turkish border. According to this version of events, a North Korean ship, officially carrying a cargo of cement, docked three days before the raid in the Syrian port of Tartus. That ship was also alleged to be carrying nuclear equipment. It is an angle that has been pushed hardest by the neoconservative hawk and former US ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton. But others have entered the fray, among them the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, who, without mentioning Syria by name, suggested to Fox television that the raid was linked to stopping unconventional weapons proliferation. Most explicit of all was Andrew Semmel, acting deputy assistant Secretary of State for nuclear non-proliferation policy, who, speaking in Rome yesterday, insisted that &apos;North Koreans were in Syria&apos; and that Damascus may have had contacts with &apos;secret suppliers&apos; to obtain nuclear equipment. &apos;There are indicators that they do have something going on there,&apos; he said. &apos;We do know that there are a number of foreign technicians that have been in Syria. We do know that there may have been contact between Syria and some secret suppliers for nuclear equipment. Whether anything transpired remains to be seen. &apos;So good foreign policy, good national security policy, would suggest that we pay very close attention to that,&apos; he said. &apos;We&apos;re watching very closely. Obviously, the Israelis were watching very closely.&apos; But despite the heavy inference, no official so far has offered an outright accusation. Instead they have hedged their claims in ifs and buts, assiduously avoiding the term &apos;weapons of mass destruction&apos;. There has also been deep scepticism about the claims from other officials and former officials familiar with both Syria and North Korea. They have pointed out that an almost bankrupt Syria has neither the economic nor the industrial base to support the kind of nuclear programme described, adding that Syria has long rejected going down the nuclear route. Others have pointed out that North Korea and Syria in any case have also had a long history of close links - making meaningless the claim that the North Koreans are in Syria. The scepticism was reflected by Bruce Reidel, a former intelligence official at the Brookings Institution&apos;s Saban Centre, quoted in the Post. &apos;It was a substantial Israeli operation, but I can&apos;t get a good fix on whether the target was a nuclear thing,&apos; adding that there was &apos;a great deal of scepticism that there&apos;s any nuclear angle here&apos; and instead the facility could have been related to chemical or biological weapons. The opaqueness surrounding the nature of what may have been hit in Operation Orchard has been compounded by claims that US knowledge over the alleged &apos;agricultural site&apos; has come not from its own intelligence and satellite imaging, but from material supplied to Washington from Tel Aviv over the last six months, material that has been restricted to just a few senior officials under the instructions of national security adviser Stephen Hadley, leaving many in the intelligence community uncertain of its veracity. Whatever the truth of the allegations against Syria - and Israel has a long history of employing complex deceptions in its operations - the message being delivered from Tel Aviv is clear: if Syria&apos;s ally, Iran, comes close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and the world fails to prevent it, either through diplomatic or military means, then Israel will stop it on its own. So Operation Orchard can be seen as a dry run, a raid using the same heavily modified long-range aircraft, procured specifically from the US with Iran&apos;s nuclear sites in mind. It reminds both Iran and Syria of the supremacy of its aircraft and appears to be designed to deter Syria from getting involved in the event of a raid on Iran - a reminder, if it were required, that if Israel&apos;s ground forces were humiliated in the second Lebanese war its airforce remains potent, powerful and unchallenged. And, critically, the raid on Syria has come as speculation about a war against Iran has begun to re-emerge after a relatively quiet summer. With the US keen to push for a third UN Security Council resolution authorising a further tranche of sanctions against Iran, both London and Washington have increased the heat by alleging that they are already fighting &apos;a proxy war&apos; with Tehran in Iraq. Perhaps more worrying are the well-sourced claims from conservative thinktanks in the US that there have been &apos;instructions&apos; by the office of Vice-President Dick Cheney to roll out support for a war against Iran. In the end there is no mystery. Only a frightening reminder. In a world of proxy threats and proxy actions, the threat of military action against Iran has far from disappeared from the agenda.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-16T00:03:25Z", "title": "Was Israeli raid a dry run for attack on Iran?", "sentences": ["The opaqueness surrounding the nature of what may have been hit in Operation Orchard has been compounded by claims that US knowledge over the alleged &apos;agricultural site&apos; has come not from its own intelligence and satellite imaging, but from material supplied to Washington from Tel Aviv over the last six months, material that has been restricted to just a few senior officials under the instructions of national security adviser Stephen Hadley, leaving many in the intelligence community uncertain of its veracity.", "Whatever the truth of the allegations against Syria - and Israel has a long history of employing complex deceptions in its operations - the message being delivered from Tel Aviv is clear: if Syria&apos;s ally, Iran, comes close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and the world fails to prevent it, either through diplomatic or military means, then Israel will stop it on its own."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/16/iran.israel"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea", "Avram Grant"], "article": "If Roman Abramovich is expecting free-flowing, attacking football after putting Israeli Avram Grant in charge, then he could be in for a nasty shock. If there has been one constant in Grant&apos;s career, it is the practicality of the sides he coaches. The appointment provoked a mixed reaction in Israel, some seeing it as evidence of Grant&apos;s exceptional skills, others prophesying the beginning of the end for him. Eyal Lachman, manager of Hapoel Acre and a close friend, said: &quot;Anybody who knows Avram Grant shouldn&apos;t be surprised. He&apos;s got a football brain and a deep understanding of the game. He deserved it. He was in line with new trends in European football and is highly valued by top managers. He can cope with the professional and mental demands of any job. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll do well. He&apos;s got so many opponents in Israel because of his qualities. Only grey, mediocre people are loved by all.&quot; \u00a0 Never a professional player, Grant began as a youth coach at Hapoel Petakh Tikva, winning the national championship and then becoming head coach at the modest club. He led the team to second place in the league before moving to Maccabi Tel Aviv, one of Israel&apos;s three biggest clubs, then in a long decline. Grant managed to transform the underachieving side. Tel Aviv played modern and aggressive - some would say brutal - football and won the championship in 1992 and 1995. The fans nicknamed him &quot;The Magician&quot;, but neutrals preferred the more aesthetically-pleasing football of Maccabi Haifa. After four years Grant left the club hailed as a savour, but his return in 1996 after one year at Hapoel Haifa came amid controversy. His successor at Maccabi Tel Aviv, Dror Kashtan, was sacked to clear the way for Grant despite having just won the double. This time the magic had gone and formerly adoring fans began calling for his head.\u00a0 A move to Maccabi Haifa, the powerhouse of Israeli football, in 2001 got his career back on track. There Grant had an outstanding team containing Yossi Benayoun, Aiyegbeni Yakubu, most of the Israeli national team and a host of foreign internationals. They won the championship comprehensively in 2001 and 2002, but exciting play was at a premium. To his credit, Grant can claim that he brought the best from a dressing room packed with stars and turned Benayoun from a brilliant but erratic midfielder into the best Israeli player of his era. He gave Benayoun the lead role at Haifa and later at the Israel national team - of which he became the manager in 2002 - and was rewarded by great performances. Under Grant, Israel drew all their World Cup qualifying games against France, Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland and almost made the play-offs. It was not pretty. Israel played with 10 players deep in defence, hardly had a shot at goal but, in light of their recent shambolic performance in Wembley, at least showed some fighting skills. The fans were, as ever, divided: some thought Grant did exceptionally well not to lose to top European teams, others suggested he was lucky and unambitious. However, one man was impressed. &quot;Grant met Roman Abramovich at the right time,&quot; says one Israeli journalist. &quot;Unlike the rest, he wasn&apos;t looking for a job or money at the time and he was a successful manager of the Israeli national team. Abramovich is a warm Zionist, Grant can be charming and engaging, and he schmoozed his way and they became close friends.&quot; Abramovich was planning to take over Hapoel Tel Aviv and install Grant there, but the deal fell through. Grant set his eyes on England, rejected an offer from Queens Park Rangers and, with the help of Pini Zahavi, became director of football at Portsmouth. At games, he used to sit on the bench next to Harry Redknapp. &quot;I am the only one taking the decisions,&quot; clarified Redknapp. Grant appeared mainly to be taking care of training sessions and helping with the transfer policy. Grant is known to have a good working relationship with top managers in England and Europe, including Sir Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, having taken short learning trips to the major clubs while coaching in Israel. &quot;I have known him for many years, we&apos;ve been to Fifa and Uefa congresses together and he is a very clever man,&quot; said Sven-Goran Eriksson today. &quot;A nice, calm man with a large knowledge of football. &quot;He has a lot of experience. He knows the English game and when he was the manager of Israel he saw at least as many Premier League games as I did. He&apos;s ready for this job. Whether he can do it as well as Mourinho, better or worse, I do not know, but the people at Chelsea obviously trust him, and good luck to him. But if you are the manager of a club like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United, the pressure is there. If you don&apos;t do exceptionally well you are out.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-20T16:54:07Z", "title": "Football: Shaul Adar profiles new Chelsea manager Avram Grant", "sentences": ["He led the team to second place in the league before moving to Maccabi Tel Aviv, one of Israel&apos;s three biggest clubs, then in a long decline.", "Tel Aviv played modern and aggressive - some would say brutal - football and won the championship in 1992 and 1995.", "His successor at Maccabi Tel Aviv, Dror Kashtan, was sacked to clear the way for Grant despite having just won the double.", "Abramovich is a warm Zionist, Grant can be charming and engaging, and he schmoozed his way and they became close friends.&quot; Abramovich was planning to take over Hapoel Tel Aviv and install Grant there, but the deal fell through."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/20/sport.comment4"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea", "Roman Abramovich", "Avram Grant"], "article": "In the warmth of an exclusive restaurant on a cold evening in Moscow in early November 2004, Roman Abramovich was sitting with friends at a private table, talking up the following night&apos;s game between CSKA Moscow and Chelsea, which the Londoners would win 1-0. Before dinner Pini Zahavi, the &apos;super-agent&apos; who played a key role in player recruitment for Abramovich in his early days at Chelsea, introduced the Russian billionaire to a friend who was also in Moscow to watch the game. It was the first meeting between Abramovich and Avram Grant. Back then Grant was head coach of Israel; less than three years later he is manager of Chelsea. &apos;Gradually, as they continued to meet, they developed a friendship,&apos; says a close friend of Grant. A fundamental element of that relationship has been, according to that same close friend, that they are both Jewish. &apos;Grant is orthodox, though he is not especially religious. It&apos;s the same with Abramovich. It is a question of identity rather than belief with the two, as if they are from the same family.&apos; When Israel visited Dublin for a World Cup qualifier seven months after that Moscow meeting, Zahavi took Abramovich to meet Grant at the team hotel. By January 2006 the Russian had become impressed enough to insist that Grant become the new manager of Hapoel Tel Aviv, a club he had an interest in. Lev Leviev, an Israeli billionaire with no interest in football, appeared close to buying the club. &apos;But it was really Abramovich,&apos; says an expert on Israeli sport. &apos;He was behind it. The idea was to sign all the best Israeli players so that they could get used to working together. This way it would improve the national team. Abramovich felt an affinity for Israel, he wanted to do something for them. But Leviev pulled out because football is played on a Saturday, which goes against his strong religious beliefs.&apos; Instead Grant moved to Portsmouth and then to Stamford Bridge this summer as director of football. Now, though he must seek a dispensation to work without some of the required coaching badges, he is manager. Thirty-five years after beginning his working life running the children&apos;s team at Hapoel Petah Tikva, his hometown club with a ground known as The Stable, Grant will send out the Chelsea team in front of 75,000 at Old Trafford today. Grant, 52, has never played professionally or taken charge of a team outside his native country. He won two league titles at both Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa, earning the latter a place in the Champions League for the first time in 2001. In four years as national coach Israel did not make it to the finals of a European Championship or a World Cup, finishing third in a qualifying group for the latter competition that contained France, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Cyprus and the Faroe Islands. &apos;It&apos;s a big challenge, he knows that,&apos; says Grant&apos;s friend. &apos;This is a huge, huge test. But Avram is clever. He is good with psychology and an accomplished man manager.&apos; He will need to be. Grant&apos;s lack of top-class pedigree means that his first vital battle is to convince a Stamford Bridge dressing room dominated by John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba that he has the right to replace Mourinho. The England captain&apos;s furious dispute with Mourinho over his form led to their bust-up last Tuesday ahead of the Rosenborg game, and was used by the board against the manager. Abramovich is content to gamble on a man who, though smarter than most in football - his three years of military duty were undertaken in the Israeli secret service - is already being seen as the &apos;yes man&apos; Mourinho could never be. Mourinho&apos;s three-year tenure was supremely successful, producing five trophies. Grant&apos;s almost impossible task is to better it. Abramovich wants two Champions League trophies in the next six years, and Chelsea to play show-business football . Grant will have to live up to his nickname of &apos;the Magician&apos;, bestowed on him by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans during his successful first spell there between 1992 and 1995. &apos;Oh, he will play entertaining football,&apos; insists the friend. But Grant&apos;s record suggests otherwise. Although unbeaten during the qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup, Israel drew all six games against Ireland, Switzerland and France. &apos;He was criticised, sure. But that&apos;s football.&apos; How does Grant, whose ideas on football are influenced by the American basketball he constantly watches, set up his teams? &apos;We would play 4-5-1 or 4-3-3,&apos; says Everton&apos;s Yakubu of his time at Maccabi Haifa under Grant. &apos;He played different systems depending on the match. We&apos;d practise them in training, we were always well drilled.&apos; The Nigerian striker credits Grant with playing a crucial role in his development after his arrival in Israel. &apos;He likes to chat one-on-one, wants to know what&apos;s going on. Avram told us that if we had any problems we could call him.&apos; Can he handle Lampard, Terry, Drogba and company? &apos;Yes. He&apos;ll be able to communicate with the big names. To become national-team manager is not easy. He is a good man.&apos; Avram Grant was born on 6 May 1955. Petah Tikva, which means gate of hope, was then a small town 10 miles from Tel Aviv but is now a suburb of the city. Grant is the only child of his late Iranian mother and Polish father, who spent time in concentration camps during the Second World War. He has two children and is married to Tzofit, an actress and TV personality. While Grant is quiet, his wife can occasionally surprise with her antics. On a chat show she hosted until recently Tzofit has drunk urine and bathed in a tub of chocolate. Having lived alone at a central London hotel for a while, Grant has been reunited with Tzofit, who finally moved over in the summer. They have bought a place in St John&apos;s Wood, &apos;because it&apos;s a Jewish neighbourhood and he can send his children there&apos;, adds his Israeli friend. Yesterday, according to Chelsea, Grant observed Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, rather than take his new players for morning training before the journey up to Manchester. Grant&apos;s remarkable journey to the top began at the age of 17, when he started coaching children. After 10 years in youth football he was appointed head of the senior side at Hapoel Petah Tikva. Three second places in four seasons and two league cups attracted Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he signed a lucrative deal by Israeli standards. That was in 1991. The first title came in his opening season. When he left four years later Grant had also won another league cup and an Israeli FA Cup. After a year at Hapoel Haifa, he signed on as Israel under-21 coach, then returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv. His second spell was not successful but Grant rescued his reputation by moving to Maccabi Haifa in 2000 and winning the club a first title in six years. The following season he delivered a second. &apos;We had a party after the game,&apos; Yakubu remembers. &apos;To win it twice was unbelievable.&apos; Less rewarding, though, was the campaign in the preliminary stages of the Champions League in 2001. &apos;We would have played Liverpool,&apos; says Maccabi Haifa owner Jacob Shahar. &apos;We beat the champions of Finland [FC Haka] away and at home. But in the second game a player who was suspended came on for the last 10 minutes. This was unfair.&apos; Grant left in 2002 for the Israel national team before moving to Portsmouth in the summer of 2006 to become director of football. &apos;Pini Zahavi had to really persuade Harry Redknapp that Grant was not going to bring trouble,&apos; says a member of the club&apos;s hierarchy. The manager wondered why Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak - who also has a Russian-Jewish background - had appointed Grant. Redknapp relaxed soon enough, but when Abramovich took Grant to Chelsea, Mourinho had his own suspicions that his employer was bringing in his &apos;nark&apos;. Grant is, by all accounts, a good guy. Asked if he stabbed Mourinho in the back he says: &apos;I worked with Jose for two months and I think our friendship was good. I enjoyed working with him and I respect what he did for the club. I came as another job, I didn&apos;t plan to be the manager, it came to me very quickly.&apos; That job begins today in Manchester. What reception does he expect? &apos;That the Chelsea fans will support the club as they did before, that they will support the team. Players come and go, coaches come and go, but the fans stay forever.&apos; He will have to live up to his nickname and work his magic if he is to convince those fans, and his players, that he really is the man for the job.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T23:10:55Z", "title": "Football: meet the magician", "sentences": ["By January 2006 the Russian had become impressed enough to insist that Grant become the new manager of Hapoel Tel Aviv, a club he had an interest in.", "He won two league titles at both Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa, earning the latter a place in the Champions League for the first time in 2001.", "Grant will have to live up to his nickname of &apos;the Magician&apos;, bestowed on him by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans during his successful first spell there between 1992 and 1995.", "Petah Tikva, which means gate of hope, was then a small town 10 miles from Tel Aviv but is now a suburb of the city.", "Three second places in four seasons and two league cups attracted Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he signed a lucrative deal by Israeli standards.", "After a year at Hapoel Haifa, he signed on as Israel under-21 coach, then returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/23/newsstory.chelsea3"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "In his careful analysis of what is and is not known about the reason for Operation Orchard, the Israelis&apos; 6 September bombing raid into northern Syria, Peter Beaumont notes that the &apos;message being delivered from Tel Aviv is clear: if Syria&apos;s ally, Iran, comes close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and the world fails to prevent it, either through diplomatic or military means, then Israel will stop it on its own&apos;. ( &apos;Was Israeli raid a dry run for attack on Iran?&apos; News, last week.) But if this can be explained away as a harbinger of Israel acting &apos;on its own&apos; to &apos;stop&apos; other states from &apos;acquiring a nuclear weapon&apos;, are other states then permitted to act on their own to cause damage to Israel&apos;s nuclear weapons programme and capability? How about to the United States&apos;s nuclear weapons programme and capability? And if not, why not? Does this right to engage in a breach of the peace under the United Nations charter apply to all states when nuclear weapon are at issue? Or only to some states on a highly selective basis? David Peterson  Chicago, USA Your leader, &apos;Time is running out to avert war with Iran&apos;, suggests that, given the rhetoric coming out of Washington, Iran may as well develop nuclear weapons. After all, the Iranians have grounds for believing that &apos;whatever they do, they will be attacked&apos;. This hardly squares with the North Korean experience. The likelihood of war has receded dramatically since North Korea began to close down its nuclear facilities. Turning a blind eye to the rhetoric that comes out of Tehran and placing no responsibility on the Iranian government for the prospects of peace makes no sense at all. Ivor Morgan Lincoln It is absolutely breathtaking that a leader on the dangers posed by Iran&apos;s possible future development of nuclear weapons makes no mention of the fact that Israel has covertly developed a huge nuclear armoury. How can other Middle Eastern states be expected to eschew nuclear status while hostile, expansionist Israel is quietly left to its own devices? Iran has attempted to conform with international conventions: it has signed up to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and welcomed International Atomic Energy Authority inspectors. Israel has never done as much: it even kidnapped and imprisoned the man who revealed its nuclear-weapons programme to the world. No demands are being made of Israel to put its nuclear weapons on the negotiating table or even to open its nuclear programme to inspection. Should we be surprised if other states in the region detect double standards and are unwilling to allow such an unbalanced situation to continue? David Richardson  Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex Your editorial last week seems to state that Iran refuses to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. It is important to note that neither the United States nor the IAEA has been able to provide any substantial evidence to prove that Iran currently has a nuclear weapons programme. Darian Meacham  Brussels Pakistan is a military dictatorship under growing pressure from Islamic extremists. Why are its real nuclear weapons less of a concern than Iran&apos;s imaginary ones? Is it because Iran has more oil or because its independence is seen as a threat to US and Israeli dominance of the region and its resources? Your leader claims that &apos;Britain&apos;s diplomatic leverage in Washington is also waning&apos;. Surely, the one thing we have learnt over the last few years is that Britain never had any diplomatic leverage in Washington.

For the God-fearing devout, the 25-hour fast is spent ensconced in prayer and penitence, pouring out confessions in synagogue and begging the Almighty&apos;s forgiveness for sins committed over the previous 12 months. White robes are worn to symbolise purity; leather footwear and other trappings of elegance are foregone in order to maximise the atmosphere of contrition and humility; and nothing other than fervent supplications passes the lips of the congregants as they sway back and forth in the aisles. However, while the faithful are shut away inside their places of worship, an equally committed section of the public spend the day worshipping their deity in their own, very different, way. Thousands of Israelis strap on helmets, saddle up their bicycles and take to the streets in droves, in a symbolic gesture that has become synonymous with their proud secularity in the face of the religious half of the Jewish state. On paper, it makes sense that &quot;Bicycle Day&quot; is held on the one day a year when there is literally not a single car on the streets, allowing cyclists to enjoy the one-off opportunity to ride unimpeded up and down high streets, main roads, and even motorways. Delighted children wheel around the city centres with their stabilisers keeping them upright, and their more proficient parents take to the hills via roads normally off-limits to riders and their mounts. But the phenomenon is more than just a celebration of a vehicle-free day in the summer. After all, it&apos;s not as though there aren&apos;t places for people to cycle during the rest of the year should they so desire. Instead, the taking to the streets in such numbers is a declaration of intent by those taking part. It is a defiant rallying cry to those who refuse to give in to what they see as an unwanted religiosity creeping ever further into their daily lives, dictating what they can do in their own country and when they can do it. The divisive chasm between the orthodox and secular in Israel is never far from the front page of the papers. Rows about whether state-owned businesses such as El-Al, the national airline, can operate on Shabbat are frequently contested either through the courts or via the airwaves of the TV networks. Violent incidents on buses sporadically occur when outraged haredim decide to forcibly move a non-compliant woman to the &quot;female side&quot; of the bus in order not to breach modesty laws. Pitched battles take place between orthodox youth and their gay counterparts every time a gay pride march is staged in Jerusalem, resulting in ever-more-bitter divisions between the two camps. But, despite all this, it&apos;s not as though Israel is run in anything resembling Taliban-style fashion. By and large, the religious are toothless when it comes to dictating the state of play for the rest of the nation, and instead are reduced to ruling the roost only in the areas where their numbers are in the majority, such as the black-hat stronghold of Bnei Brak. And it cuts both ways - for example, the fiercely defiant secular areas of Tel Aviv, where the residents take no notice of pleas for observance from their religious counterparts, and party all through Shabbat and the holy days as though Judaism was a mere irritant in the back of their collective consciousness. For my part, I&apos;ve got a foot in both worlds - quite literally, at the moment. Whilst I spend most of my time in my flat in the fairly orthodox German Colony of Jerusalem, I&apos;ve also got a flat for the summer on the beach in Yafo, which, thanks to its largely Arab populace and proximity to downtown Tel Aviv, is the complete antithesis to my main residence. And, having seen both sides of the coin for weeks now, it&apos;s becoming more and more clear that this country is irredeemably polarised when it comes to bridging the gulf between the opposing communities. For all that I mourn the lack of contact between Israelis and Palestinians, the internecine conflict within Israel&apos;s borders is as, if not more, pressing an issue in terms of social cohesion and communal stability. The ultra-orthodox, by virtue of their strength in numbers are a force to be reckoned with for anyone taking them on in the political arena. They cast block votes in elections, according to the directions of their spiritual mentors, and can make or break government coalitions according to whether or not their demands are met, be they for extra funding or for blanket exemption from the army for their offspring. Their ability to force the hands of those in the Knesset results in open hostility on the part of their secular neighbours, who see the state&apos;s pandering to the religious as an intolerable insult to the rest of the country. And so they do what they can to show that they&apos;re not cowed, such as pedalling their way through the deserted streets on Yom Kippur. And, though their energetic protest goes unchallenged by the fast-weary orthodox making their way to and from the synagogue, their actions certainly don&apos;t go unnoticed. Another year, another Day of Atonement, and another reminder that all is certainly not forgiven or forgotten on the streets of the Holy Land.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "Day of division", "sentences": ["And it cuts both ways - for example, the fiercely defiant secular areas of Tel Aviv, where the residents take no notice of pleas for observance from their religious counterparts, and party all through Shabbat and the holy days as though Judaism was a mere irritant in the back of their collective consciousness.", "Whilst I spend most of my time in my flat in the fairly orthodox German Colony of Jerusalem, I&apos;ve also got a flat for the summer on the beach in Yafo, which, thanks to its largely Arab populace and proximity to downtown Tel Aviv, is the complete antithesis to my main residence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/24/dayofdivision"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "Roman Abramovich", "Football"], "article": "So what was the first decision Avram Grant took as the new, allegedly permanent manager of Roman Abramovich&apos;s Chelsea? He dropped Shaun Wright-Phillips, the club&apos;s most effective attacking player this year, for Sunday&apos;s match against Manchester United. What did that do for the team? Nothing, evidently. And what did it do for Wright-Phillips, whose eventual success in casting aside the burden of that absurd \u00a321m transfer fee made fools of those of us who, believing him to have suffered a catastrophic and probably irreversible failure of confidence, had long since written him off? The reappearance of Wright-Phillips as a force in the Premier League was the result of Jose Mourinho&apos;s refusal to toss the tiny winger on to the scrap heap, and a tribute to real managerial nous. It also worked to England&apos;s benefit, giving Steve McClaren a straightforward option when David Beckham proved unfit to continue his own international renaissance. It made Grant&apos;s decision to leave him on the bench at Old Trafford seem inexplicable, except in terms of some self-defeating tactical game of chess. By appointing Grant, Abramovich has made fools of us all. He has shown that if you have enough money and power, you can do anything you like with an English football club. You are answerable to nobody, least of all the fans - who may not have liked everything about Mourinho, or the way his team played, but who - whatever some of them may claim - enjoyed the three years of success a whole lot more than the half-century of very mixed fortunes that preceded them. Had Abramovich announced a Marcello Lippi or a Guus Hiddink as Mourinho&apos;s successor, there would have been few complaints. But when he put the fortunes of one of England&apos;s contenders for Champions League honours into the hands of a man of such limited experience, Abramovich might as well have sent an insulting postcard to every one of Chelsea&apos;s season ticket holders. Grant is said to be an amiable and hard-working fellow with many friends inside football. He is clearly a first-class networker. He also understands one of the meanings of the word &quot;nexus&quot; - the means of connection between things linked in series - and that the most effective nexus in big-time professional football currently runs between Moscow, Tel Aviv and London. Which is why he is unlikely to make a fuss if he witnesses his employer handing out tactical advice to a player, as Abramovich is alleged to have done last Wednesday, when - through Andriy Shevchenko&apos;s skill as a translator - he is said to have instructed Michael Essien to pass the ball forward more often, rather than out to the wings. Or possibly vice versa. Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of AC Milan, may be few people&apos;s idea of an ideal choice as a holiday companion, but at least he understands the boundaries of presidential power in football. In the early 90s he used to chivvy Fabio Capello to pick Dejan Savicevic, a player too lightweight for the coach&apos;s tastes, just as today he is always telling journalists that he wants Carlo Ancelotti to abandon his natural caution and play two strikers, rather than one. But he never insists (although he did have his day of glory when Savicevic dominated the 1994 European Cup final). Chelsea, however, seem to have landed themselves with an owner to whom the proper limits of that influence have not been explained, probably because there is no one around him brave enough to do it. And that way disaster lies. Toyota still on fast lane to nowhere after five years If the management of the Toyota formula one team can summon up the common sense that has been absent from their long and fruitless campaign to establish themselves among the frontrunners, they will pay Fernando Alonso whatever it takes to put his name to a driver&apos;s contract for next season. Toyota came into formula one five years ago, with a mediocre car and drivers to match. Having rid themselves of Mika Salo and Alan McNish after a single season, they did little better with two years of Olivier Panis and Cristiano da Matta. For 2005 they pushed the boat out and signed Jarno Trulli, one of the fastest drivers of the generation, if not one of the most aggressive (although certainly the best wine-grower), and, on a truly exorbitant salary, Ralf Schumacher, who is definitely the sulkiest driver of his time. Still no wins. The lack of results is not just the drivers&apos; fault. The cars, too, have always seemed half a step behind their rivals. The technical problems would disappear if they managed to persuade Ross Brawn, the brain behind Michael Schumacher&apos;s championships at Benetton and Ferrari, to take over the guidance of the team. The rest of their worries would be solved by the capture of Alonso&apos;s combination of experience and ambition. Since Toyota are now the biggest carmakers in the world, with a bottomless purse, it&apos;s hard to see what might be stopping them. La Baule&apos;s young triathletes steal England&apos;s thunder England&apos;s rugby team spent the weekend in La Baule, at the very hotel that provided a headquarters for Glenn Hoddle&apos;s footballers throughout their World Cup campaign in 1998. La Baule, however, had other things on its mind. Sunday was devoted to the Atlantic Triathlon meeting, a series of events ranging from elite seniors down to local eight-year-olds. It began 20 years ago when a group of students from a business management college in nearby Nantes organised a competition for themselves on La Baule&apos;s beautiful 7km beach. Now it is sponsored by the college, and attracts Olympic-standard athletes from all over Europe to a field of 2,000. But the most fun was provided by the hundreds of children who competed in four age-group categories with the highly vocal support of their parents: &quot;Allez, Loulou!&quot; &quot;Allez, Guillaume!&quot; &quot;Allez, Fabienne - allez, ma cherie!&quot; The most poignant sight was that of an eight-year-old girl who set off on the swimming leg but decided that up to her armpits was quite far enough. Returning to the shore, she was quickly surrounded by five middle-aged officials, among them a paramedic. They could not have shown more concern had she been an Olympic champion. New Camp Nou will be good enough for Mourinho Congratulations to Sir Norman Foster, whose design for a \u00a3175m remodelling of the home of Barcelona FC was unveiled at the weekend and will be completed in 2011. No Wembley-style arch for this project: the new Camp Nou will be cocooned in a mosaic of blue, maroon, scarlet and yellow, an apt visual metaphor for the team&apos;s style of play. But will they still be playing that way under Jose Mourinho? One grey strip is bad enough, but two . . . Whoever allowed Scotland and New Zealand to wear such similar strips at Murrayfield on Sunday should have his eyes tested.

Grant was then Israel&apos;s coach and, when Brown scouted Ben Haim in international action, the pair enjoyed each other&apos;s company. &quot;I know Avram certainly had the respect of the Israeli national team and I think he&apos;ll soon have the respect of Chelsea&apos;s players,&quot; insisted Hull&apos;s manager. The 48-year-old Brown is hoping he gets the chance to show off his own managerial potential tonight - and he has not neglected his homework. &quot;I was at Old Trafford on Sunday, mainly to watch the interaction of the Chelsea management team and their players and I&apos;ve come away with one or two ideas,&quot; he explained. &quot;I was measuring how quickly Chelsea&apos;s players had adjusted to the new manager and his tactics, to see the bench and the team exercise the tactics they had been working on for the previous few days. That interaction is very important.&quot; Despite spotting a couple of potential chinks in Chelsea&apos;s new armour during their defeat to Manchester United, Brown was generally impressed. &quot;I don&apos;t think Avram had the rub of the green because major decisions went against them and they weren&apos;t that creative because of the sending-off. But they gave a very good defensive account of themselves and were organised, sharp and bright.&quot; Even so, the briefings Brown has delivered to his staff behind the door bearing a sign declaring &quot;War Room&quot; at Hull&apos;s training ground have contained cause for optimism. &quot;We plan our attack in the &apos;War Room&apos;, we close the door and work out our strategy,&quot; said Brown, right, whose assistants discuss less highly charged matters in &quot;The Bunker&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m not underestimating Avram&apos;s ability but Chelsea have just lost one of the best managers in the world and our opportunity to win this tie is probably a little bit greater than it would have been with Jose Mourinho at the helm. &quot;Suggestions that Chelsea are in disarray are ridiculous but there is a little period of transition going on and, if we play to our best and they don&apos;t, we maybe have a chance.&quot; Such hopes are enhanced by the presence of Jay-Jay Okocha, the former Nigeria captain, among the home ranks. Bored by a lucrative life in Qatar&apos;s fledgling league, the midfielder accepted Brown&apos;s invitation to renew a relationship which began at Bolton. &quot;I don&apos;t think Chelsea will look forward to coming to a place like Hull, some of their players won&apos;t even know where it is,&quot; reflected Okocha yesterday but his manager demurs. &quot;The Chelsea players will love the KC,&quot; Brown countered. &quot;It&apos;s a Premiership stadium and that could work against us.

One of its numbers is a presidential campaign song, including the lines: &quot;He&apos;s the man the people choose,/ Loves the Irish, loves the Jews . . .&quot; Since then, ethnic-minority or hyphenated-American interest groups have become ever more influential. When President Harry Truman decided to recognise the new-born state of Israel immediately after it was proclaimed in 1948 - against the advice of the State Department, the secretary of state, George Marshall, and the great foreign-policy oracle George Kennan - he explained his decision with commendable frankness: &quot;In all my political experience I don&apos;t ever recall the Arab vote swinging a close election.&quot; No one doubts that American politicians assiduously court the Jewish vote (to which Truman was of course alluding), nor that there are a number of very effective groups in Washington lobbying for Israel, nor again that self-proclaimed neoconservatives have played a large part in the administration of Bush the Younger, nor that, in the tragic and intractable conflict in the Holy Land, American policy has been heavily biased towards Israel. Does that mean that, as the authors of The Israel Lobby claim, the bias is the work of that lobby? This book has now become part of its own story. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt are well-known and well-respected American scholars, at Chicago and Harvard universities respectively. They were commissioned by the Atlantic Monthly to write an essay on the influence of the lobby, but when the piece was delivered the magazine thought better of it. It then found a home at the London Review of Books, where it detonated an explosion in the spring of last year, as the authors relate in this book, which has grown out that essay. One of their contentions was that critics of Israel, and of the lobby, are bullied, browbeaten and blackguarded, not least by the unscrupulous charge of anti-semitism. With a wondrous lack of self-irony, numerous people came forward when their essay appeared to confirm the authors&apos; very point for them. &quot;Yes, It&apos;s Anti-Semitic&quot;, shouted a column in the Washington Post by Eliot A Cohen; Alan Dershowitz compared the essay with &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, Martin Peretz called the authors &quot;obsessives with dark and conspiratorial minds&quot;, and Christopher Hitchens said the piece was &quot;smelly&quot;. Doesn&apos;t this sound like protesting too much? Another stick used to beat the authors was the claim that their work was methodologically faulty. I&apos;m not sure that is so, but their book is longer and more ponderous than it need have been. They make a tactical mistake when they examine the moral case for supporting Israel. This question is really so subjective - who knows which country &quot;deserves to exist&quot;? - that they would have done better to leave it aside. As it is, even raising the subject might make them appear in some eyes to be relentless foes of the Jewish state. They have no difficulty at all in citing a long list of neoconservative supporters of Israel, some of them in the Bush administration, who ferociously and repetitiously demanded an invasion of Iraq. Linking the dots, Mearsheimer and Walt suggest that the war was thus fought because of the lobby, but this does not necessarily follow. After all, Tony Blair took Britain into what many of us then said would be, and most people now concede has been, a needless, illegal and disastrous war, but while he did so for various reasons, almost all of them discreditable, he was not trying to win Jewish votes or gratify an Israeli lobby, since none comparable exists here. And the authors concede - which should always be remembered - that Jewish Americans in general were more opposed to the war than the national average. Where Mearsheimer and Walt are on their strongest ground is in saying, as foreign-policy realists, that the Israeli alliance is very costly for the United States, and that&apos;s where American supporters of Israel are on their weakest ground. Those supporters sometimes claim that the alliance is based on the affinity so many Americans supposedly feel for Israel, but at the same time they &quot;bend over backward to help people understand that help for Israel is also in America&apos;s strategic interests&quot;, as Hyman Bookbinder of the American Jewish Committee put it. But by now it must be obvious to an intelligent 12-year-old, in Baghdad, Jenin, Tel Aviv or even Washington, that the Israeli alliance, far from advancing American interests, gravely damages them and has hindered every American endeavour in Arab countries or the whole Muslim world. The alliance could still be defended in terms of loyalty and sentiment - America and Israel &quot;contra mundum&quot; - but the lobbyists and the neocons have painted themselves into a corner with that exorbitant language of &quot;strategic interests&quot;. Even so, whatever may be said about Israel or its advocates, the people who come out far and away the worst from this story are American politicians; and The Israel Lobby had the most unusual effect of making me rather proud of my country and its parliament. The Palestinians have friends on both sides of the Commons and, while there are also Labour and Conservative Friends of Israel, there is nothing remotely like the craven grovelling habitually displayed by Democrats and Republicans alike. Although the Iraq war may not have been &quot;fought for Israel&quot;, it is demonstrably the case that the lobby can turn Congress on and off like a light switch. At the height of the bombardment of Lebanon in the summer of last year (which ended up by weakening Israel more than Hizbullah), the House of Representatives passed a resolution of unconditional support for Israel by 410 votes to eight. As Mearsheimer and Walt show from polls, this did not even reflect opinion in America, let alone in Europe or Asia. There&apos;s nothing wrong in principle with &quot;loves the Jews&quot; as in the Gershwin number, but it&apos;s a pity if that ends up being the answer to the anguished question Americans ask about the rest of the world: &quot;Why do they hate us?&quot; \u00b7  Geoffrey Wheatcroft&apos;s books include The Controversy of Zion, which won an American National Jewish book award, and Yo, Blair!

If you splat me, I&apos;ll splat you - in our Mad old world. (That&apos;s Mad as in &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot;.) But now the madness is more miasmic, dementia lacking discernible doctrine or even plain speaking. Take Iran, North Korea and the missile defence row currently consuming much of eastern Europe. And while you&apos;re at it, take Pakistan too. Prague, Warsaw and Moscow are racked in rowdy debate because George Bush wants to site 10 missile interceptors in Poland (facing east), served by a new early-warning radar station inside Czech borders. But whose prospective attacks would those interceptors intercept, pray? Why, threats from Pyongyang and Tehran, says Washington. In these uncertain times, we&apos;ll keep Europe safe from harm. Just shut up and let us move our heavy metal in. It&apos;s thin stuff, of course, rendered ever more flimsy with passing events. North Korea - remember? - has bowed out of the nuclear game, at least on America&apos;s own recognisance. And Iran continues to declare no intention of joining the game anyway. (Trust that or not, there are plenty of other responses on offer that don&apos;t come near Poland.) So what on earth is the White House up to? President Putin thinks he knows as he ponders installing more buttons of his own. This is 20th-century arms racing returned to post-millennium duty. This is a fresh beginning for the madness we once understood. Superpowers great and diminished still need their nuclear fix. But why not say so openly? Why not lay out a revised doctrine that voters from Krakow to Chicago can understand as they pay their taxes? It&apos;s not possible, apparently, because we&apos;ve totally lost the plot. Two investigative reporters well known to Guardian readers - Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott-Clark - have written a chilling new book. Deception, published this month, returns AQ Khan, the &quot;father of Pakistan&apos;s bomb&quot;, to centre stage. It demonstrates, in dismaying detail, why Khan wasn&apos;t the lone ranger of political legend, building nukes he could peddle round the Middle East and Asia for cash. It fixes Khan firmly inside the Pakistani establishment - and, worse, it shows how Washington, anxious to keep Islamabad sweet through the years of cold war Afghanistan conflict, actively assisted Khan&apos;s team to make WMD. In short: Pakistan joined the nuclear club - pointing its missiles at India&apos;s missiles - because the west gave it a covert helping hand for anti-Soviet Kabul purpose. The west helped a patently unstable Islamic nation, ruled for most of its time by permutating generals, to get WMD. The west watched AQ Khan trying to flog its knowhow and kit to rogue states. And yet now, in the midst of a supposed war against terror, the west dare not confess to past errors nor address present perils. There&apos;s a real, pervasive delirium here. Perhaps Pakistan itself is more internally chaotic than the precise scenario Deception paints. Perhaps happenstance is the real signpost at many crossroads. But a land of 160 million plus, ruled for the moment by a president weakening by the minute as he takes his medals off, a leader who can&apos;t make his writ or the writ of army run in huge tracts of tribal territory along the Afghan border - areas where al-Qaida operates with impunity - is at least as threatening as an Iran that hasn&apos;t got a bomb yet or a North Korea that&apos;s given it up: or a Moscow welcome whenever the G8 assembles. Nearly two decades after the Berlin wall came down, nukes new and old litter our earth. Some of them are in &quot;safe&quot; hands (as in &quot;Good Old Gordo&quot;). Some of them are in supposedly more febrile hands beyond the Urals. Some - attention Israel - aren&apos;t talked about in politic company. Some - untested, perhaps unusable - could get into the &quot;wrong&quot; hands, be popped into a suitcase and render all America&apos;s defence mechanisms redundant in archetypal Tom Clancy fashion. But one thesis doesn&apos;t begin to cover all. One thesis slithers into another. And danger, minus any linking idea, is a merely a cry of confusion, a reason to shake fists at Iran, but never to shake up our own rootless thinking. Wise countries that could have made a bomb have declined to try. Countries, such as Britain and France, that happen to have a bomb for reasons embraced long ago haven&apos;t begun the new thinking that has to count most in a different era. Thriller writers and CIA budget boosters have licence to chill. The Mad we survived on for decades, that still applies to India v Pakistan, somehow doesn&apos;t apply when Tehran and Tel Aviv enter the frame. Is Prague supposed to look out for blips heading west in case they were launched in Waziristan?

It is the story of the princess who defies authority and gives the corpse of her brother, deemed a traitor by the state, the burial that she believes is his due. In the process she challenges the authority of her uncle, King Creon, and loses her own life. Seamus Heaney&apos;s The Burial At Thebes has only just finished its London run and now up pops another new version of the drama that gives a contemporary spin to the age-old play. David Levin is the former artistic director of the Habima National Theatre in Tel Aviv, but he now lives in Scotland and he will bring his experience of the Middle East to a production which, like its teenage heroine, refuses to lie down and be quiet. Lyn Gardner \u00b7  Tron Theatre, Wed 10 to Oct 27 Chatroom/Citizenship  Salford Teenagers are often ignored or vilified in our culture, but they take centre stage at the Lowry in the National Theatre&apos;s double bill alongside the premiere of Innit The Musical, a fledgling work by Micky Dacks about being a 17-year-old in Salford. The NT&apos;s Chatroom &amp; Citizenship combines the talents of leading playwrights Enda Walsh and Mark Ravenhill. Their combined ages must be pushing 70, but the great thing about these plays - a chilling tale of cyberspace bullying and a coming of age story about a boy struggling with his sexuality - is that you feel the writers are telling from some place inside themselves that will forever be 15. LG \u00b7  Lowry, Tue 9 to Sat 13 Flower Girls Ipswich Disabled-led theatre is still considered by some to be second rate, but anyone who caught Graeae&apos;s recent revival of Sarah Kane&apos;s Blasted will know that just isn&apos;t true. Now Richard Cameron, who had a huge hit with The Glee Club, has written this work inspired by the stories of the disabled women who lived and worked at The Crippleage in Edgware. Set against a changing society in the years between the early 1940s to the mid-60s, it is likely to be distinguished by an emotional honesty and the mix of the gritty and the tender that marks all of Cameron&apos;s work.

City types will be beating a path to the Arts Theatre to see Alex, the animated tale of an investment banker who started life on the pages of the London Daily News in 1987 and now adorns the front page of the Daily Telegraph&apos;s business section. Robert Bathurst, best known for TV&apos;s Cold Feet, takes the title role and, thanks to digital projection and direction by Improbable Theatre&apos;s Phelim McDermott, will interact with the drawings of Charles Peattie. Familar characters include Alex&apos;s sidekick Clive, boss Rupert and his wife Penny. Alex has become something of a role model for bankers, notably for his deviousness and manipulation.

Mark Cook \u00b7  Arts Theatre, WC2, Thu 11 to Dec 8 The Blacks remixed  London Jean Genet&apos;s The Blacks was considered radical and contentious even in 1959. It was inspired by the independence of Ghana, the first black African country to break away from colonialism, and was a violent assertion of black identity using a play within a play - the re-enactment of a rape and murder before a kangaroo court - to tackle themes of oppression and racism. Now, to mark the 50th anniversary of Ghanaian independence and the 200 years since the abolition of slavery, The Blacks remixed is an overhaul of that piece, using slam poetry and hip-hop music. In this new translation by Robert David Macdonald, directed by Ultz and Excalibah, the Queen (actress and comedian Tameka Empson) comes to a Command Performance at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, but what she sees is nothing like the Royal Variety Show. MC \u00b7  Theatre Royal Stratford East, E15, Fri 12 to Nov 10 Alphabetical Order  Salisbury Philip Wilson takes over the reins of Salisbury Playhouse and begins with a revival of Michael Frayn&apos;s enjoyable 1975 play set in the clippings library of a provincial newspaper. Frayn, who had a distinguished career on the Guardian until he turned all his attention to writing fiction and plays, knows this territory intimately, making this tale of order versus chaos and heart versus head all the better. Setting up a conflict between library manager Lucy, who files articles as the fancy takes her, and newcomer Leslie, who wants to bring order to the library as well as the entire world, Frayn&apos;s perky comedy offers two opposing views of life which are both put to the test when it is announced that the newspaper is to close. While Frayn&apos;s scenario may seem a little old-fashioned in an era in which the clippings library has been replaced by instant online access, his dissection of the human heart remains entirely true. LG \u00b7  Salisbury Playhouse, to Oct 27 Nicholas Nickleby  Edinburgh Jonathan Church&apos;s revival of this old Royal Shakespeare Company hit from more than a quarter of a century ago is a real crowd-pleaser for those who love their Dickens and have seven hours to spare. David Edgar&apos;s adaptation cleverly fillets the epic novel into two parts and is as English as roast beef as it tells the story of Nickleby, his wicked uncle, the brutal schoolmaster Wackford Squeers and the doomed, brain damaged orphan Smike. The entire show is a bit like a really early Christmas card combining decent sentiments and sentimentality to good effect within a framework that recognizes the abundant theatrical nature of Dickens&apos; original. Even if you can only catch the first half, this production is well worth a look.

Sheibani, whose recent productions include Bola Agbaje&apos;s Gone Too Far at the Royal Court and Laura Wade&apos;s Other Hands at Soho, clearly has an excellent eye for a good play and may well have picked up a cracker in this one about two brothers - one hard-working and the other fresh out of jail - whose lives are about to take a turn for the worse. At 25, US writer Tarell Alvin McCraney has already won himself a mighty reputation in New York, where the Brothers Size originally premiered. Heading into London for a month-long residency at the Young Vic later in the year, the play, set in present-day Louisiana but drawing on Yoruba myth, ushers in a new era for ATC, a company which in recent years has seemed a little uncertain of its identity. No surprise to see it popping up at the Drum, which has its fingers on the pulse of new writing.

Our conversation ranged over the trials and tribulations of the life of a member of TIPH, the very large amounts of money he seemed to be making, and the merits of Jerusalem when compared with other cities in the region. An offhand remark he made concerning the political balance of power in Hebron turned the conversation from mildly interesting to memorable. I asked him if Hamas was gaining ground in the city of Hebron. He replied wearily that the fastest-growing political force in the city was not Hamas, nor any of the other well-known Palestinian political movements. Rather, the most notable and noticeable development on the ground in Hebron was the sudden and rapid rise in support for the Islamist party Hizb ut-Tahrir. Subsequent months have attested to the truth of my Swedish friend&apos;s unexpected claim. Hizb ut-Tahrir (the &quot;party of liberation&quot;) is indeed growing in strength and visibility in the West Bank, especially in the areas of Jerusalem and Hebron. So what does the Hizb&apos;s emergence as a political factor mean, and what implications may it have (if any) for the future direction of events between Israelis and Palestinians? Hizb ut-Tahrir was founded in Jordanian-ruled Jerusalem in 1952 by a sharia court judge, Taqiuddin al-Nabhani. The party inscribes on its banner the goal of the restoration of the caliphate - the Islamic government established after the death of Muhammad in 632, and abolished by Kemal Ataturk in 1924. The party wants the imposition of sharia law - eventually worldwide - and is in favour of the destruction of Israel. However, it sees this as the job of the conventional forces of the restored Islamic caliphate. The party has thus not employed the methods of terror attacks against Israelis, as favoured by other, more prominent Palestinian Islamist currents, such as Hamas and Islamic jihad. Hizb ut-Tahrir has grown from its beginnings in Jordanian Jerusalem into an international force, with branches in 45 countries in the world. It has achieved particular notoriety in central and southeast Asian countries, in particular in Uzbekistan and Indonesia. It has also come to prominence in western European countries - particularly in Britain, where a branch was established in 1986. A number of the best-known British participants in Islamist terrorism attended meetings of the group or one of its offshoots at certain stages of their trajectories. These include Omar Khan Sharif, who tried to bomb the Mikes Place bar in Tel Aviv in 2003, and the &quot;shoe bomber&quot;, Richard Reid. In the Arabic-speaking world, Hizb ut-Tahrir was long regarded as an obscure, eccentric current. Some analysts saw its failure to place the Palestinian issue at the centre of its concerns as contributing to its marginality. This is now changing. In the West Bank in the last months, Hizb ut-Tahrir has held a series of successful events, which mark its entry onto the stage as a significant player in Palestinian politics. In early August, the party organised a number of mass rallies in the West Bank, including a gathering of 10,000 people in the town of Al-Bireh, and similar-sized rallies in Hebron and Ramallah. These took place under the slogan &quot;The caliphate is the rising force&quot;, and coincided with similar gatherings held by branches around the world. The rallies followed a year of frenetic activity and growing prominence for the movement in the West Bank, which saw activists, for example, protesting against the establishment of a new mission school in Hebron in May, 2007 and organising demonstrations in protest at the Danish cartoons of Mohammed in October, 2006. What does the rise of Hizb ut-Tahrir among Palestinians imply? First, it indicates that the assumption over the last two decades that Palestinian politics was essentially a two-horse race between nationalist Fatah and Muslim Brotherhood/Hamas may be beginning to fray at the seams. More profoundly, the emergence of the movement raises a question over the optimistic scenario recently raised in some quarters, according to which once Islamist movements such as Hamas are tested in office and fail, previous, predominantly secular patterns of politics will re-emerge. It may well be that a deep, and profoundly significant &quot;Islamisation&quot; of the politics of the Arab world is taking place, the implications of which are only beginning to be glimpsed. Looking around the region, the wall-to-wall dominance of Islamist groups in opposition politics appears to attest to such a process. Hizb ut-Tahrir itself may well end up being only one of many symptoms of this broader trend, all trying to ride the wave. Such a shift, if it takes place, would have severe implications for hopes of a consensual peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and for wider regional stability. A Fatah official I spoke with recently told me that in his view Abu Mazen was &quot;the last Palestinian,&quot; whose failure would mean the emergence to prominence of a new brand of chaotic, rejectionist politics among the Palestinians. So had my Swedish friend - enjoying his weekend off in a west Jerusalem bar - revealed a dot on the horizon, indicating the approach of something new? It&apos;s too soon to tell, of course. But interested parties among both Israelis and Palestinians will no doubt be keeping a close eye on the activities of Hizb ut-Tahrir in the West Bank in the period to come.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-09T13:30:00Z", "title": "The rise and rise of Hizb ut-Tahrir", "sentences": ["These include Omar Khan Sharif, who tried to bomb the Mikes Place bar in Tel Aviv in 2003, and the &quot;shoe bomber&quot;, Richard Reid."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/09/theriseandriseofhizbuttahrir"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Bolton Wanderers", "Europa League", "Uefa Cup 2007-08"], "article": "Bolton Wanderers were handed the marquee tie of today&apos;s Uefa Cup group stage draw when they were drawn alongside Bayern Munich in Group F.

Although the criticism is water off a duck&apos;s back to me now, earlier on in my Cif career I was a somewhat more sensitive soul, leading me to turn to my moral guide - Alex - for help in countering my detractors. I asked him what I should say to the people who demand I write about a hospital that treats both Jews and Arabs. &quot;Look,&quot; he replied, leaning back in his chair as he attempted to continue eating hummus at the same time as imparting his wisdom. &quot;If there&apos;s a hospital in Britain that treats both white and black people, then that&apos;s not a story - but if you find a hospital that refuses to treat black people, then that&apos;s worthy of comment.&quot; His words came to mind again yesterday as I sat in a marquee in the Israeli-Arab village of Sakhnin, where a friend of my parents was donating a new emergency medical centre to the town&apos;s residents in a blaze of pomp and circumstance. The dedication ceremony was the result of several years of planning on the part of MDA (Magen David Adom - the Israeli Red Cross) and the Sakhnin municipality, and was feted as the first time MDA had funded a casualty station in an Arab village. In light of this historic moment, the townspeople put on a serious show in honour of the donors, with everything from a marching band to a guard of honour to a troupe of dancing children - all laid on to mark the occasion. The head of the Jordanian Red Crescent Society also made an appearance, alongside various other Arab luminaries, and the afternoon-long event culminated in a sumptuous feast once the sun set and the Ramadan fast was over. Wide-eyed children from the village stared at the proceedings from behind the iron railings around the courtyard, watching in awe as the lavish celebrations continued long into the evening. Also present were dozens of international delegates from Friends of Magen David Adom, who had been convening all week in Tel Aviv for their annual fundraising conference. Representatives from the States, Europe, South America and beyond all looked on beatifically as their British colleague unveiled the centre in honour of his late wife Irene. Decked out in their off-duty finest - pastel Ralph Lauren polos for the men, daytime diamonds over T-shirts for their wives - they basked in the collective plaudits being laid at their feet by the grateful mayor and dignitaries of Sakhnin, and with good reason. For all that many outsiders would like to tar all supporters of Israel as inherently racist towards the minorities of the country, this was a perfect example of a group of Jewish philanthropists extending a helping hand to the local Arab community and building bridges of coexistence at the same time. As the principal donor said in his speech, MDA &quot;does its life-saving work for anyone, regardless of race&quot;, before going on to dedicate the ceremony to &quot;our forefathers Isaac and Ishmael - we&apos;re all brothers and sisters here&quot;. Another patron of the project praised MDA for &quot;bringing together all sections of Israeli society to work as one - religious, secular, Muslim, Jew&quot;, suggesting that the building of the Sakhnin centre should set an example to the entire Middle East region in terms of cross-communal partnership. In response, the head of the Jordanian Red Crescent Society showered the benefactors with praise, saying that the whole event reminded him of an apposite Chinese proverb. &quot;To have peace, we must first have peace with ourselves, then peace with our family, then with our neighbours, then with our village, then with our city ... and so on until the whole world is at peace.&quot; Recognising the importance of grassroots projects such as the Sakhnin centre, he expressed hope that this groundbreaking scheme would open the floodgates for similar enterprises to materialise. As I broke bread with the doyens of the Friends of MDA over dinner, I was encouraged to get the story out to as many people as possible - &quot;especially those who don&apos;t think Jews help non-Jews, because it&apos;s vital that their eyes are opened to the reality here&quot;. I agreed wholeheartedly with their sentiments regarding this particular project, since those involved were motivated by nothing but altruistic and philanthropic intentions, and deserved all the accolades due to them for their actions. However, Alex&apos;s words came back to haunt me as I considered the day&apos;s events on my return home. Here was the moment that the hospital that treated both black and white patients actually became the story - and that&apos;s not to Israel&apos;s credit at all. That the majority of the speakers felt it necessary to mention the Jew-Arab link in the project speaks volumes about how divided and fractured the country really is. It&apos;s not the fault of MDA that their fundraising endeavours take on such a political slant on occasions such as this (although it could be asked why this is the first such project in all their years of donating vast sums to the State of Israel). As the speakers said, the donors of MDA aren&apos;t motivated by race or politics, but rather by the overriding desire to save the lives of anyone in need. At the same time, that the Jews-helping-Arabs element needed to be highlighted to the onlookers at all means that this kind of action is still considered an oddity; something so unusual that it needs to be held up to the light and shown off to an amazed public for their approval. Granted, it&apos;s almost unthinkable that a mirror-image occurrence would transpire in the Arab world with a group of Arab donors raising money for a Jewish cause - but that&apos;s not the point. Israel&apos;s supporters have to move on from comparing themselves to other unsavoury states in the Middle East. Israel aspires to be a true example of democracy and tolerance in a region bereft of suitable role models, hence it looks to the west to take its lead and move forward. And, while nothing should be taken away from the sterling work of MDA&apos;s supporters in this case, the fact that we are still bowled over by Jews assisting Arabs means we&apos;ve got a long way to go till we&apos;re a truly equal society.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-10T18:30:00Z", "title": "Wounds still need to be healed", "sentences": ["Also present were dozens of international delegates from Friends of Magen David Adom, who had been convening all week in Tel Aviv for their annual fundraising conference."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/10/woundsstillneedtobehealed"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli army is continuing to bar Palestinian students from Israeli universities, in spite of an order from the Israeli high court that it relax its restrictions. The army was asked to explain its policy in March 2006, but it has so far asked for delays on seven occasions. The delays mean that Palestinian students will miss the start of the Israeli term on October 15. As the discrimination against Palestinian students continues, the UK University and College Union (UCU) announced last month that it would not be legal for it to discriminate against Israeli academics, students and institutions in protest against Israel&apos;s treatment of Palestinians. Sari Bashi, the director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that has challenged the army ban, said: &quot;No one should be denied access to higher education based on nationality. Academics - not army generals - should decide who studies at Israel&apos;s universities.&quot; Palestinian citizens of Israel and holders of East Jerusalem identity cards are allowed to study at Israeli institutions, but residents of the West Bank and Gaza face restrictions. It is not clear how many students have been affected because the army refuses to reveal how many permits it granted in the past. There are a number of Palestinian universities in the West Bank and Gaza, but they do not offer doctorates or MBAs. Many Palestinian students live in easy commuting distance of the Israeli universities they want to attend. Earlier this month, the Israeli supreme court refused to intervene to help Palestinian student Khaled Mudallal return to his studies at Bradford University. Mr Mudallal returned to Gaza to get married, but was trapped when the borders were closed because of the outbreak of violence between Palestinian factions. Israel&apos;s terminal at Erez is open, but the army claims it cannot process requests to leave Gaza. And restrictions are equally harsh in the West Bank. Ms Bashi said that the army ban appeared to begin in 2006. She said no change in policy was announced, but the army started refusing permits to Palestinian students who wanted to study in Israel. Gisha petitioned the high court, but each time the army was expected to explain its criteria, it sought and was granted a postponement. &quot;On seven occasions the army has postponed,&quot; Ms Bashi said. &quot;These delays serve to perpetrate the ban. The court has now asked the army to attend a hearing on November 1. It is already too late for this term, but hopefully we can get a change for next term.&quot; Saed Hasan, an information technology consultant from Ramallah, was refused entry to Israel to take up a scholarship awarded to foster better relations between Israeli and Palestinian businesses. Mr Hasan was due to study for an MBA at Tel Aviv University on a course that was sponsored by Northwestern University in the US. &quot;The programme would allow me to study and work closely with executives from a neighbouring strong economy - Israel&apos;s - and help me contribute to the Palestinian economy. Our societies are interdependent,&quot; he said. Last week, the Israeli army restated its ban on Mr Hasan, saying he had no right to enter Israel and adding for the first time that they had secret information that he had ties to terrorist groups. &quot;I was very disappointed but I kind of expected it,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have been a dream to do this MBA because it has so many meanings for me and my colleagues at the business. It would have shown that you can still have normal personal and business relationships between Israelis and Palestinians in spite of everything.&quot; Mr Hasan, speaking while on a business trip in California, said it was nonsense to suggest that he had any ties to militants. He said the best proof of this is the fact that he has been allowed to travel freely all over the world for his work. &quot;I am just a normal person trying to do my job. If the Israelis suspected that there was anything wrong, I would be in jail, not crossing borders and going to Israeli airports,&quot; he said. Palestinians studying at Palestinian institutions also face a range of difficulties from the Israeli army. Increasingly, Palestinian students are confined to studying in their home towns. Birzeit University, near Ramallah, is less than an hour&apos;s drive from An-Najah University in Nablus, but it can take a Palestinian student all day to make the journey. Students travelling to An-Najah from surrounding villages and towns have to leave their homes three or four hours early to make the short journey to class. Obstacles include the separation barrier, checkpoints, and road barriers that are opened at the whim of young soldiers. Palestinian universities used to have students from all over the West Bank and Gaza, but now they are more local in character. This prevents the universities from becoming national cultural centres because their potential audience is restricted to people from the surrounding areas.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-11T10:35:54Z", "title": "Palestinian students continue to face exclusion", "sentences": ["Mr Hasan was due to study for an MBA at Tel Aviv University on a course that was sponsored by Northwestern University in the US."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/oct/11/highereducation.uk1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Politics", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Friday lunchtime in the upmarket strip of Dizengoff Street, Tel Aviv, is like walking onto the set of a Vogue shoot. Every girl strutting by looks like Nicole Scherzinger, reminiscent of the restaurant scene in Being John Malkovich where the entire room is filled with clones of the balding actor, and seeing and being seen is the only thing on their minds. People sprawl on sofas outside cafes, eyes hidden behind aviator lenses and mobiles perma-clamped to their ears as they while away the opening act of another weekend&apos;s laconic performance. Today, right in the heart of the whole show, a small group of earnest activists gathered around a cluster of olive trees on the corner of Ben Gurion and Dizengoff, hoping to draw the masses&apos; attention to their heartfelt protest. Organised by the Coalition of Women for Peace, they were marking the opening of the olive harvest season by performing a symbolic reaping in the heart of Tel Aviv from trees they claim were stolen from Palestinians. Their cause was just, their aims were true, but they never stood a chance when it came to waking the beautiful people from their apathetic slumber. Part of the problem was that they were hidden from view by exactly the trees that formed the centrepiece of their demonstration, meaning most of the passers-by didn&apos;t have a clue that any kind of action was taking place yards from where they walked. However, even those who sat eating their lunch at the outdoor tables on the same strip of the boulevard were utterly uninterested in what was going on next to them. Turning their noses up at the flyers being proffered by the hopeful protesters, they went straight back to admiring one another&apos;s clothes and fawning over their latest partners. They were, as Alex put it, &quot;far too busy being agonisingly beautiful to worry about Palestinians&apos; trees being nicked.&quot; I went olive picking with a similar group in the West Bank last year, and I&apos;m full of admiration for those dedicated to aiding the Palestinian farmers. At the same time, however, they must have known today&apos;s exercise was doomed to fail in terms of rallying public support for their cause. This generation of bourgeois Tel Aviv residents just doesn&apos;t care - and the lack of interest is endemic the length and breadth of Israel. For a country that used to brim over with political activists and protestors, the speed with which the youth have turned indifferent and lethargic is as alarming as it is dangerous. Alarming, because it shows how swiftly a state founded on zealousness and enthusiasm can morph into just another lackadaisical westernised country. Dangerous, because the majority&apos;s ennui leaves a vacuum in the political sphere which the extremists are only too eager to fill with their own beliefs. In Israel&apos;s case, it is the right wing who have seized on the opportunity quickest and most effectively. I said as much in a recent piece when considering whether anything was likely to stop the settlement juggernaut, and - on the strength of today&apos;s performance - the malaise has set in deeper than I first thought. Watching the complete disdain with which the public treated a serious political protest shocked me, given the gravity of the conflict that has engulfed these Israelis their whole lives. If they were forced to think about the issue of the IDF wantonly destroying Palestinian olive groves in order to annex their land, most of the Dizengoff diners would likely express some sympathy for the farmers&apos; plight on a humane level. However, it&apos;s precisely because they&apos;re too busy with their cappuccinos and tuna salads that they don&apos;t ever get made to address what&apos;s happening on their own doorstep. The right wing knows this, and capitalises on it in spades. When they put on a protest - such as the incendiary march I went on during the summer - they do so knowing full well there won&apos;t be a counter protest by their opponents. They&apos;re also gradually wresting control of the army too, with 45% of officers now coming from the &quot;knitted kippa&quot; religious Zionist camp. And, like it or not, their ability to play the game is paying off big time. As reported in the Guardian this week, the expansionist policies of the government are continuing unchecked; the stranglehold of the security wall is still firmly in effect; and the punitive measures taken against the Gazans are barely opposed by the people on the Israeli street. That doesn&apos;t mean to say that the left wing isn&apos;t alive and kicking. It is - all of today&apos;s protestors will doubtless spend much time over the next few months getting their hands dirty as they help the Palestinians gather their crops. Likewise, the grassroots projects of the likes of Machsom Watch, Yesh Gvul and their counterparts will continue at their usual pace, helping the people who really matter at the heart of the issue. But the dispiriting spectacle I witnessed today in the heart of uptown Tel Aviv leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. The silence of the majority leaves the field wide open for the fervent and dedicated minority to impose their will on the political course that the country charts. I genuinely don&apos;t believe that most of Israel&apos;s citizens want to pursue a path of war, intolerance, expansionism and injustice, regardless of how many times readers tell me just that on the threads. What I do believe, instead, is that too many Israelis - especially amongst the younger generation - have just stopped caring. The post-army opium-trail through the far east quickly detaches them from what they&apos;ve witnessed during their national service, and by the time they come back to reality they&apos;re too busy with their own career and bettering their own status to care about the conflict. And when the only olives they care about are the ones adorning their fettucine alfredo, all the flyers in the world aren&apos;t going to paper over the cracks in their consciences.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-13T15:00:00Z", "title": "Not a care in the world", "sentences": ["Friday lunchtime in the upmarket strip of Dizengoff Street, Tel Aviv, is like walking onto the set of a Vogue shoot.", "Organised by the Coalition of Women for Peace, they were marking the opening of the olive harvest season by performing a symbolic reaping in the heart of Tel Aviv from trees they claim were stolen from Palestinians.", "This generation of bourgeois Tel Aviv residents just doesn&apos;t care - and the lack of interest is endemic the length and breadth of Israel.", "But the dispiriting spectacle I witnessed today in the heart of uptown Tel Aviv leaves a bitter taste in my mouth."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/13/notacareintheworld"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Stadiums were booked, the celebrity endorsements lined up, but a week before Canadian rocker Bryan Adams and Brad Pitt were due to launch twin peace concerts in Tel Aviv and Jericho, an extravaganza &apos;against violent extremism, occupation and terror&apos;, organised by the group One Voice, has been cancelled amid a welter of recriminations.

Citing security concerns as the reason that the Jericho show was called off, the paper reported that &quot;Palestinian participants were threatened&quot;, requiring the organisers to pull the plug on the event. The concerts, organised by the OneVoice organisation, hadn&apos;t appeared on my (admittedly weak) radar until I read the Post&apos;s article, but reading of the cancellation put me in a defeated mood as I headed off to catch my plane back to London. This seemed to be yet another case of extremists taking umbrage with a centrist movement&apos;s pleas for rapprochement, and putting the frighteners on the organisers until they caved in and cancelled their efforts. Nothing new, I thought to myself, it&apos;s been this way for years in the region - the minute anyone puts their head above the parapet, the snipers come and silence their opponents through violence or threats. It&apos;s as though the moment a light of hope flickers to life in the gloom of the interminable conflict, hordes descend on the flame blowing furiously to extinguish it and leave the situation mired in darkness once more just as the fundamentalists like it. In the case of the Jericho concert, it was Palestinian extremists who had headed off the event&apos;s organisers at the pass - but at the same time, the Post reported that Chief Rabbi Metzger had also been leaned on by his flock to withdraw his support from the Tel Aviv show. He&apos;d initially agreed to participate because he &quot;thought [OneVoice&apos;s] goal was to voice moderate views on the conflict&quot;, but after being harassed by right-wing rabbis and MKs, he decided to step back due to the group&apos;s &quot;political agenda which includes territorial compromises&quot;. So, here was a movement with apparently massive support from both the Israeli and Palestinian camps, trying to unite the two sides and getting a kicking from every angle in return for its efforts. A year&apos;s work organising the summits, which were to have had Bryan Adams perform as well as local artists and were due to be screened around the world, was up in smoke and beyond repair. And, as I found out when I contacted the organisers on my return to London, the whole debacle was the result of a thoroughly orchestrated, and thoroughly misleading, smear campaign by the hard left, One-State camp. According to Jake Hayman of OneVoice, members of the boycott-Israel group PACBI decided that OneVoice were pushing a &quot;secret agenda&quot; advocating the Palestinians giving up the right of return, among other things. They issued a release effectively denouncing OneVoice&apos;s efforts in the region, which was immediately picked up by hardline groups, including the notoriously intransigent ISM. &quot;Some of the boycotters got hold of a set of surveys we did five years ago,&quot; said Hayman, &quot;and have changed questions into statements and manipulated them to suggest that we do have a secret agenda of our own final status negotiation.&quot; By distorting the facts in this way, he said, the boycotters set into motion a chain of intimidation and intense pressure that resulted in the safety of the OneVoice people involved being put in intolerable jeopardy. Hayman also commented that &quot;they missed the point entirely that we are about empowering the process instead, because - as it stands - even with the perfect &apos;answer&apos;, the leaders are too weak and hardliners too strong to see it implemented&quot;. That&apos;s the raison d&apos;etre of OneVoice, and makes the theoretical argument that derailed the summits look even more absurd than it appeared at first glance. &quot;It&apos;s heartbreaking,&quot; Hayman said. &quot;Not only has the Palestinian street been conned, but also the Israeli public and international community, who will now think that the Palestinian grassroots won&apos;t even attend a conflict-resolution event such as this&quot;. OneVoice&apos;s efforts had, thus far, been making significant inroads into the region&apos;s consciousness, with more than 600,000 Israelis and Palestinians having signed up to the group&apos;s mandate. Hayman&apos;s distress will doubtless be shared by everyone connected with the organisation, but it&apos;s the people the group are trying to reach who will also suffer the consequences of the concerts&apos; stifling. The events would have bolstered the confidence of the moderates on either side of the divide, making them believe that the middle-ground peace camp was gathering momentum and taking centre stage in both the hearts of Israel and Palestine. Instead, those - like me - reading of the event&apos;s cancellation in the national press will shake their heads in disappointment before turning the page and reading of the &quot;success&quot; of other, more violent groups as they push their own solutions on the troubled area. And, when it turns out that those purportedly helping the Palestinian cause (ISM, PACBI, and the like) are the ones who&apos;ve done the most damage to OneVoice&apos;s pleas for peace, hopefully the penny will drop that it&apos;s time to ignore the extremists once and for all. From the right-wing rabbis to the flag-burning ISMers, there has to be a mass awakening that neither side will ever have their every last demand met when it comes to a conflict as complex as this. As Tony Klug pointed out in his brilliant analysis of the situation, there will need to be very heavy, and very painful, concessions from both sides before peace really has a chance to envelop the region. Until they do, however, the lights of peace will continue to be snuffed out whenever they&apos;re lit, and the likes of OneVoice will continue to be beaten down whenever they try to rise above the maelstrom and bring the warring factions together. And, if they&apos;re kicked down every time they try, one day they&apos;ll just stop bothering - and when that day comes, the ISM and Israeli hardliners will only have themselves to blame for what follows.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-17T07:00:00Z", "title": "One Voice - unheard", "sentences": ["As I sat in my house yesterday waiting for my cab to the airport, I came across a small article in the Jerusalem Post announcing the cancellation of two upcoming &quot;peace concerts&quot; in Jericho and Tel Aviv.", "In the case of the Jericho concert, it was Palestinian extremists who had headed off the event&apos;s organisers at the pass - but at the same time, the Post reported that Chief Rabbi Metzger had also been leaned on by his flock to withdraw his support from the Tel Aviv show."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/17/onevoice"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Batman"], "article": "Nicolas Cage will star as the father of an American-born Muslim who disappears while overseas, in the forthcoming The Vanished.

A sublime opener was followed by the inane offence that triggered Russia&apos;s comeback for an ominous victory. He will be in anguish over a lapse by the referee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, since the player&apos;s foul was committed a fraction outside the area, but the risk was immense and it was no surprise that a penalty was awarded. Those minded to castigate the official should recall that he also erred by not disallowing Rooney&apos;s beautiful goal, which was fractionally offside. The wonderful Manchester United forward has many years left to redefine himself but today he is, with much over-simplification, the embodiment of the lapses that could well cost his country a place at Euro 2008. In fairness he was not alone. The goalkeeper, Paul Robinson, is to be blamed for the winner. Steve McClaren will rue his faith in the accident-prone Tottenham keeper but the manager must be distressed, too, by the fact that the current alternatives are the veteran David James and the uncapped Scott Carson. England will almost certainly fail now if Guus Hiddink&apos;s side beat Israel and Andorra. Victory is inevitable in the latter of the two away fixtures and McClaren will be reduced to telling himself how hard Tel Aviv is for visiting teams. The likelihood still is that it will be on his watch that England do not reach a major tournament for the first time since 1994. His tenure could turn out to be short. McClaren has made mistakes on other occasions but his destiny in the Luzhniki Stadium was cruel. Much that England did was sound until the 68th minute when Rooney&apos;s judgment proved brittle. The clich\u00e9s about the menace of attackers attempting to defend does not begin to cover this folly. Reaching out, he stopped the run of Konstantin Zyryanov by manhandling him on the verge of the box. Roman Pavlyuchenko, a substitute, converted the penalty for the first of his goals. Since an aberration even on the scale of Rooney&apos;s cannot be the sole factor, it must be stated that England were going through a difficult spell then. The desperation of the opposition was at last leading to penetrating moves and England were becoming frantic but they might have survived. Hiddink raised the stress level with the introduction of Pavlyuchenko. At his home ground the Spartak Moscow striker brought with him a physical presence and a combative mentality. The visitors, belatedly, were ruffled. Had a Russian equaliser been delayed for a while, a beneficial draw might in any case have been teased out of the evening. Robinson was found wanting once Pavlyuchenko had levelled the score. While Alexei Berezutsky&apos;s drive was strong in the 73rd minute, it was well within the reach of the goalkeeper. He should have been capable of beating the ball far away or putting it behind for a corner. As it was, the goalkeeper patted the ball down in the goalmouth and Pavlyuchenko bundled home the winner. The opener from Rooney felt remote then, despite its memorable beauty. After half an hour Micah Richards hit the ball long, Michael Owen headed it in one of his few contributions and Rooney controlled with his chest before putting a dipping volley into the net. There was no sustenance left, though, after Russia had taken the lead. England could not react, except with the usual set pieces that were never quite headed on target. Neither McClaren nor his deflated men had any good ideas left. Maybe it is hard to rally when you cannot believe the predicament that has, all of a sudden, engulfed you. Hiddink commented that he had targeted England&apos;s left flank because, with Joleon Lescott tucking inside as an auxiliary centre-half, there was no genuine defender outside him.  McClaren was ultimately forced to witness a total lack of reward for the well-laid schemes that had been prepared for this fixture. It looked as if Hiddink&apos;s run of failure against English teams at club and international level would reach 10 games without a win but England supporters had forgotten about John Terry&apos;s absence and the alleged iniquity of an artificial pitch, absorbed instead by the efficiency of their side. A five-man midfield did not deliver worthwhile width for Russia then, because England&apos;s wingers were judicious in rationing their breaks forward. Steven Gerrard curbed himself, staying deep to form a barrier with Gareth Barry. Russia, at that juncture, could not turn the visitors and were reduced to playing fecklessly in front of them. As if that were not heartening enough, Hiddink&apos;s defence seemed fearful. A simple win was in prospect. That might have been achieved in another keynote incident. Barry piloted a free-kick deep in the 49th minute and Gerrard must have been bewildered by the amount of space he enjoyed. What else could explain the volley by the stand-in captain that was hit wide. It did not take long until Russia were at last showing the pace and touch to distress England. There was desperate resistance, as when Sol Campbell had to deal with a treacherous low ball from the substitute Dmitry Torbinsky. The escapes did not continue. England&apos;s future seems grim, as does McClaren&apos;s.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-18T20:53:43Z", "title": "Euro 2008 qualifier: Russia 2-1 England", "sentences": ["Victory is inevitable in the latter of the two away fixtures and McClaren will be reduced to telling himself how hard Tel Aviv is for visiting teams."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/18/match.englandfootballteam"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "A bizarre conspiracy theory has been coming out of London since Wednesday night. If anyone thinks that Israel will throw their game against Russia next month because of Roman Abramovich&apos;s connections with Israel, they are talking nonsense - and that is putting it mildly. Abramovich is a nonentity in Israeli culture and his appointment of Avram Grant as Chelsea&apos;s manager caused his reputation here more harm than good. England fans should also be aware that even though there are more than a million Israelis who emigrated from the former Soviet Union, the majority of the country wants England to qualify. Support for England in Israel is not a new trend. When Moshe Sinai, assistant to the current Israel coach, Dror Kashtan, was asked during his playing days what his hobbies were he said: &quot;Football, and English football.&quot; Many people here feel the same. The two most popular foreign teams in Israel are Manchester United and Liverpool, and many Israel fans grow up watching the English league on a regular basis. Or maybe it is the heritage of the British mandate: the legal infrastructure, the law that every house in Jerusalem should be covered in stone which gave my city its unique character, and many other things the Brits gave us. In any case, we love you. There are few national teams that Israel would care about but England are one of them. Had France been in England&apos;s place, Guus Hiddink and Abramovich could have booked their summer in Austria and Switzerland yesterday. Thanks to Grant, most England fans know about Israel&apos;s heroics in the last World Cup qualifying campaign. Israel played France, the Republic of Ireland and Switzerland twice each and lost none. The problem was we won none as well. Actually, Israel have not beaten a quality team in donkey&apos;s years. A win against Russia on November 17 looks a non-starter, then, but can we draw? Sadly Israel are out of the Euro 2008 qualifying picture. Although the crowd&apos;s favourite chant is &quot;War!&quot; it is rare to see the players fighting if they don&apos;t have to. Terms such as &quot;garbage time&quot; and &quot;a team that has finished the season&quot; are fundamental to Israeli football jargon and usually the team who need the points more will get them. Russia desperately need three points when they play in Tel Aviv. But motivation should not be missing for Israel. Kashtan is already talking about the 2010 campaign, which is an attempt to shift the focus from his current failure but has brought about changes. About half the side from last month&apos;s fiasco at Wembley, when England won 3-0, have lost their place and Israel are now built around youngsters and the three leading players: Yossi Benayoun, Tal Ben Haim and the goalkeeper, Dudu Aouate. The revolution will probably bring relatively high motivation, as in last Saturday&apos;s 1-0 defeat in Zagreb, but not much confidence, experience or quality. Still, for a home draw, energy and motivation may suffice. Only 4,632 fans came on Wednesday to see Israel play a friendly against Belarus. Ticket price: free. It looked so bad the TV cameras were moved to catch some fans in the frame but the optical illusion didn&apos;t help. The national team are important only when they still have a chance of qualifying. Once that chance is over, you can hear the air escaping. The stadium may be full next month but don&apos;t expect electricity in the stands. Not unless speculation that dozens of oligarchs and thousands of Russia fans will attend proves accurate. A mini- invasion of Russians - many from within Israel - might provide the spark that Israel need. There is nothing like being an underdog to get the best out of the Israelis. It would also help if in England you told your organisations of academics to stop talking about boycotting Israel. You don&apos;t want to mess with us now when we hold your Euro 2008 destiny in our hands. In Israel it&apos;s never just about football, and that&apos;s maybe why we haven&apos;t qualified for a major tournament since 1970.

Everything just goes on too long and fractious tears must fall. The side led in quarter-finals at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, yet there were tantrums by the close. Now the attempt to reach Euro 2008 has gone badly awry and the FA is again reduced to wondering how this team is ever to stay the course. One of the punishments for failing, in Moscow, to make use of an opening goal lies in the fact that England are riddled with a sickly hope. Steve McClaren&apos;s squad can still advance if Russia are denied full points in Tel Aviv before the formality of their victory over Andorra. Should Guus Hiddink&apos;s side take care of business, England might get to the finals in Austria and Switzerland at the expense of Croatia. That, however, would require Slaven Bilic&apos;s players to lose in Macedonia and get beaten by a three-goal margin at Wembley. That latter outcome would be quite some coup, considering that England have long been dogged by an incapacity to get the best out of their players. McClaren is crashing into that same barrier. Even in triumph, Russia probably had a single footballer, in the captain Andrei Arshavin, who could demand a place in the England team. There is little likelihood of survival for McClaren, who has not corrected the exasperating syndrome of anticlimax. References to a &quot;golden generation&quot; are made satirically these days, now that everyone knows that the sheen of these footballers is a bad paint job which flakes at the merest scratch. Some call for an immediate sacking of the manager but that would be futile. Where would the benefit lie in installing a caretaker? Any long-term successor to McClaren who was available would balk at taking over for the fag end of a sorry campaign. Most likely McClaren will scoop \u00a32.5m or so in compensation and the new man will be blooded in a summer tour, conceivably to South America or Japan. The recruitment process surely cannot be as protracted again, since the FA already went through all of this in 2006. With luck the chief executive, Brian Barwick, has held on to his notes. A tradition of running in the opposite direction from the latest disappointment implies a surge away from a native manager and back towards candidates from the continent. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, a Frenchman steeped in English football for 11 years, would be viewed as the ideal choice, but there is no proof he is any more available than he was in the past, particularly now that the Arsenal project is entering another riveting phase. Luis Felipe Scolari, Fabio Capello, Hiddink, Jose Mourinho and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann would appear on the list of those targets whose roots are in the culture of mainland Europe, but the quest need not necessarily be conducted via the Channel tunnel. Should the priority be to locate someone whose prime gift lies in getting the very best out of every player, then Sam Allardyce or, even more likely, Martin O&apos;Neill would be the ideal person to galvanise underachieving England. McClaren, until Wednesday, had been getting somewhere in the endeavour to prove that he could develop England. In general managers are praised overmuch in the aftermath of good results and damned extravagantly when a game goes wrong. There are always causes for complaint and no exemption is ever going to be granted the person in charge of England. The preference to let Joleon Lescott start his first England match was a curiosity, in the light of his nerve-racked debut as a substitute against Estonia. Some, including the Russia manager Hiddink, detected opportunity in his inclination to drift from the left-back position and stick close to the veteran centre-back Sol Campbell, who proved not to require such aid. None the less Russia, for a long time, made little of the space on that flank, where Joe Cole attempted to be an auxiliary defender. Even in the second half, Hiddink&apos;s team menaced more on England&apos;s right, where Shaun Wright-Phillips was stationed. No matter what criticism is made, the 1-0 lead for McClaren&apos;s side was intact with the game approaching the closing 20 minutes. Can a manager legislate for the ardent Wayne Rooney, who had dropped back to cover after Cole pushed up, clutching at Konstantin Zyryanov? The body language of the Manchester United striker announced that he too thought it was a penalty, although replays show it to have been marginally outside the box. So Russia were level, but a draw would have satisfied England. McClaren has kept on picking Paul Robinson and it was his gamble that the side would qualify for Euro 2008, giving him the chance in the spring to install another goalkeeper, whether it was to be Aston Villa&apos;s Scott Carson or Manchester United&apos;s Ben Foster. Robinson messed up when the England manager was 17 minutes short of a draw he would have seized with relief. McClaren has had several faults as an international manager, but one of the failings is to have been unlucky at the decisive moment.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-19T00:21:48Z", "title": "McClaren may be doomed but was damned unlucky", "sentences": ["Steve McClaren&apos;s squad can still advance if Russia are denied full points in Tel Aviv before the formality of their victory over Andorra."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/oct/18/mcclarenmaybedoomedbutwas"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "We&apos;ve had Live 8 and Live Earth, and this week, albeit on a smaller scale, we almost had One Million Voices. Organised by the OneVoice group, the declared aim was to bring together Palestinians and Israelis in simultaneous events in Tel Aviv, Jericho, London, Washington and Ottawa to voice support for the &quot;moderates&quot; and call for a negotiated two-state solution. The plans fell through, amid bitter claim and counter-claim, as artists lined up for the Jericho event cancelled, and the Tel Aviv concert followed suit. This followed grassroots pressure by Palestinians who objected to what they see as yet another attempt to promote a false peace that fails to address the structural injustices driving the conflict. Indeed, despite the peace rhetoric - and the claim that they represent a unique popular call - OneVoice&apos;s approach suffers from the same flaws that have bedevilled official &quot;peace&quot; efforts from Oslo to the Quartet. Such errors were amply demonstrated in Seth Freedman&apos;s column, which implied that the main obstacle to peace is the &quot;extremism&quot; that exists on both sides. This interpretation of the situation in Palestine/Israel is only possible through a heavy airbrushing of history and a fundamental misreading of the present. Strikingly, the Tel Aviv concert was scheduled to take place in Hayarkon Park - the same location where, almost 60 years ago, the Palestinian village of Jarisha was wiped off the map by Jewish armed forces. Its residents shared the same fate as almost 800,000 other Palestinians, expelled from what became Israel and prevented to this day from returning home, their land confiscated. Yet official OneVoice material gives the impression that the conflict only began 40 years ago, when Israel occupied the rest of Palestine (the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem). Condemning the &quot;extremist minority&quot; of both sides sounds laudable. Of course, &quot;both sides&quot; use violence, and of course, there is hatred and religious extremism among both Palestinians and Israelis. The crucial point, however, is that Israel has all the power. Israel is occupying and colonising Palestinian land, not the other way round. Palestinian cities are besieged by a modern, hi-tech Israeli army and subjected to closure, raids and bombardment - not the other way round. Zionist colonisation is not the preserve of a fanatical fringe in Israel - it is fundamental to the state&apos;s identity and practice. As Martin Luther King said: &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot; Since Israel continues to show no intention of relinquishing its role as colonial overlord, it&apos;s no good to condemn &quot;both sides&quot;, as if there is equality between occupier and occupied. Unsurprisingly, those with intimate firsthand experience of this apartheid are under no illusions about the usefulness of toothless &quot;peace processes&quot;. Earlier this week, the UN human rights envoy for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, John Dugard, condemned the Quartet for failing to safeguard Palestinian rights. The BBC&apos;s Tim Franks noted that many diplomats and officials based in the region &quot;would agree with Mr Dugard&apos;s political analysis&quot; yet refrain from agreeing publicly. The language of moderation is all the rage, from OneVoice to Condoleezza Rice, from the aborted peace concerts to the forthcoming November peace conference. It&apos;s a seductive dichotomy; on the one side are those who light the flame of peace, who strive for a &quot;mass awakening&quot; to the &quot;forces of light and friendship and love&quot;. On the other side are the extremists who threaten, smear and mislead; they are wickedly intransigent - they stifle, snuff out hope and burn flags. But what is a &quot;moderate&quot;? In recent times, &quot;moderate&quot; has been applied to some rather unlikely characters in the Middle East. For the US, UK and Israeli governments, these include states like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. None of these permit much genuine freedom of expression; all of them oppress opposition movements. In fact, Saudi Arabia is one of the world&apos;s most repressive regimes. It seems &quot;moderation&quot; has nothing to do with whether you refrain from the torture of political activists or the flogging of &quot;deviants&quot;, and everything to do with your obedience to US policies and Israeli interests. That is what unites the Saudi royals, the Egyptian president and the Jordanian king. Meanwhile, groups like ISM, and Another Voice are condemned by Freedman and OneVoice as &quot;extremists&quot; out to &quot;eradicate the other side&quot;, and accused of making unnamed and unspecified threats. Yet these groups are committed to the defence of human rights and international law, and are made up of tireless Israelis, Palestinians and internationals. Their categorisation as &quot;extremists&quot; then, is actually a reflection of their refusal to accept sugar-coated apartheid or well-meaning platitudes that serve the status quo. It may be an uncomfortable truth, but peace for both peoples comes no closer if the fundamental power disparity between Israel and the stateless, occupied and dispossessed Palestinians is obscured. Confronting the vested interests that perpetuate Palestine&apos;s conquest may not win you awards from Jordanian monarchs or praise from the US state department; but it ultimately brings you a lot closer to peace.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-19T06:00:00Z", "title": "The moderate blindfold", "sentences": ["Organised by the OneVoice group, the declared aim was to bring together Palestinians and Israelis in simultaneous events in Tel Aviv, Jericho, London, Washington and Ottawa to voice support for the &quot;moderates&quot; and call for a negotiated two-state solution.", "The plans fell through, amid bitter claim and counter-claim, as artists lined up for the Jericho event cancelled, and the Tel Aviv concert followed suit.", "Strikingly, the Tel Aviv concert was scheduled to take place in Hayarkon Park - the same location where, almost 60 years ago, the Palestinian village of Jarisha was wiped off the map by Jewish armed forces."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/19/themoderateblindfold"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jose Mourinho would rebuild the England team around Frank Lampard if the Football Association responded to public demand and asked him to become the next national team coach. The FA have publicly backed Steve McClaren in the wake of the midweek defeat in Russia, which takes qualification for Euro 2008 out of England&apos;s own hands. But it is widely accepted that McClaren&apos;s position would be untenable should his team fail to reach the finals. Mourinho, the most successful young coach in world football, would be a popular replacement. Observer Sport first revealed the Portuguese&apos;s interest in taking on the post on 23 September, four days after his departure from Chelsea. Though Mourinho has been the victim of prurient tabloid interest in his personal life since then, his interest in managing England has not diminished. &apos;Nothing has changed,&apos; said a source close to Mourinho yesterday. &apos;If something happened to McClaren and the FA invited Jose to do the job he would be very interested in taking it on. It is a real possibility.&apos; Lampard has been the target of criticism recently and was left out of McClaren&apos;s starting XI in Russia. The midfielder, who was booed by England fans last weekend, received a message from Mourinho after the defeat assuring him he would be central to the manager&apos;s plans should he take charge. Lampard was one of Mourinho&apos;s most trusted campaigners during three seasons in which he brought five major trophies to Stamford Bridge. How Mourinho would work with John Terry, currently England captain, is a moot point. As part of a severance deal with Chelsea worth \u00a310.5million after tax, Mourinho cannot take a managerial position at another English club before the start of next season. There is, though, no clause preventing him from coaching the national team. A major attraction of the England position is that it would allow his family to return to London, where they had settled well and recently purchased a house. The reluctance of his two children to leave the city played a significant role in Mourinho&apos;s ultimately ill-fated decision to remain at Chelsea last summer despite the multiple problems of the 2006-07 season. Chelsea are struggling to regain their equilibrium post-Mourinho. Didier Drogba last week further unbalanced the squad by telling France Football magazine of his desire to leave the club and that &apos;something is broken with Chelsea&apos;. Drogba added that he knew exactly what had caused Mourinho&apos;s departure, saying &apos;I find it hard to look certain players in the eye without getting angry.&apos; The striker also confirmed The Observer&apos;s report that he considered missing Chelsea&apos;s Champions League victory at Valencia to facilitate a January transfer. &apos;It is true,&apos; said Drogba. &apos;When you are as disappointed as I have been you sometimes take impulsive decisions.&apos; The methods of the man who replaced Mourinho, Avram Grant, have disconcerted much of the squad. Grant is considered by many to be a placeman of owner Roman Abramovich, who has taken an increasingly hands-on role in team selection and started giving tactical instruction to senior internationals. Eyebrows were raised again last week when Chelsea announced the appointment of Michael Emenalo as chief scout. Though Emenalo, 42, is a former Nigeria international, he never played top-level European football and his most recent position was as director of player development at Tuscon Soccer Academy in the United States. His coaching responsibility there was for one of the academy&apos;s girls&apos; teams. He did, though, spend the final two years of his playing career under Grant at Maccabi Tel Aviv.Emenalo&apos;s brief as tactical scout is to observe and compile reports on Chelsea&apos;s opponents. He replaces Andre Villas Boas who was known for delivering some of the most comprehensive reports in the business. A Chelsea spokesman said: &apos;We regard the coaching issue as totally irrelevant to his job and he has the total confidence of Avram and everyone at the club.&apos; Drogba was not the only player to express discontent with Chelsea last week. His friend Florent Malouda also criticised the club&apos;s decision to dispense with Mourinho. &apos;Jose&apos;s departure saddened me a lot,&apos; said Malouda in an interview with ESPN. &apos;I really felt like his departure was more a personal issue than anything else, the club wanted him out. &apos;We cannot say the club is back on track and not in crisis. Honestly, right now we can&apos;t pretend we can win the Premier League. Even if we won in Valencia and Bolton, we are not dominating and we didn&apos;t really control the game.&apos; Like Michael Essien, Malouda was lectured by Abramovich in the aftermath of Mourinho&apos;s last match in charge, the home draw with Rosenborg. The \u008020million (\u00a314m) summer signing was told to &apos;stop preparing for the Olympics in your lane, play again like you did at Lyon&apos;. The Russian is also reported to have shouted &apos;fantastic football&apos; sarcastically at Mourinho after the match. Grant, however, argues that there are no problems within the squad. He said: &apos;I have read many things that were not true about problems in the dressing room. I am very happy with the atmosphere and the attitude of the players until now and I am sure that it will continue.

Not just any sand - the trickle of fine grains that I emptied onto the damp, south London pavement was more silver than orange or yellow. It had come from one of the world&apos;s most fabled wildernesses, the Empty Quarter - a sand sea covering 250,000 square miles of southern Arabia, a place which less than 80 years ago hadn&apos;t been crossed or mapped by a European. A place T E Lawrence referred to as &apos;the great unsolved question of geography&apos;. A place Wilfred Thesiger, the legendary explorer of Arabia, called &apos;a bitter, desiccated land that knows nothing of gentleness or ease ... a cruel land that can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match&apos;. I&apos;d been for the weekend. Insane as it now seemed, that very morning I&apos;d been in the Empty Quarter, close to where the borders of Yemen, Oman and Saudi Arabia meet, sitting alone astride a towering dune and watching the sun rise. Thesiger would be turning in his grave. He spent five years getting to know the Empty Quarter, living with its tribes and travelling as one of them. He despised the thought of fast travel, hated machines, and bitterly resented news of the first crossing of the Sahara by car (it took 21 days). What would he have made of a trip to the Empty Quarter that only required two days off work?  For the past few years, the &apos;exotic short break&apos; has been one of the travel industry&apos;s key growth areas. It started with weekends in Marrakesh, and before long Monday morning chat (around the water coolers in law firms and bank HQs, at least) was full of blase references to the weekend&apos;s wine tasting in Cape Town, clubbing in Tel Aviv, or safari in Kenya. It&apos;s not hard to see the appeal - such fleeting trips are the closest we get to the thrill of teleportation, deliciously disorientating breaks from the routine. But until now, nothing has offered quite the same degree of dislocation, of utter melon-twisting discombobulation, as this tiny dose of the colossal, timeless, unknowable, Empty Quarter.  Just to add further spice to the culture clash, this long weekend visit to what remains a very wild part of the world (where a war with communist rebels was still raging in the 1970s), is conducted in a degree of luxury that verges on the surreal. I&apos;d come down from my dune that morning, for example, to enjoy a shower, then a bowl of Crunchy Nut cornflakes, melon, fresh coffee and orange juice and a choice of breads, all served at a proper wooden table, with cloth, set up in the middle of nothing but endless sands.  The trips have been dreamt up by Mike Wilson and Sean Nelson, two British expats and former army colleagues. They launch in earnest this week, but three weeks ago I was given a preview.  We land in Muscat, capital of Oman, on Saturday morning after an overnight flight from Heathrow, then fly on to Salalah, a port city in the far south. Mike is waiting at the airport. Tall and rake-thin, with greying hair, sparkling blue eyes, a pointy beard and twirling moustache, he&apos;s dressed in sand-coloured shirt and trousers, and a black shamagh, the local Arab headdress. He speaks in a deep, burbling voice that puts you in mind of Alec Guinness or an RSC Othello, if with a slightly bluer turn of phrase.  We jump into one of two waiting Nissan Armadas, giant 4x4s painted a sexy military matt beige, and head to our first camp. Unlike luxury safari camps in Africa, this one is mobile, designed to be pitched and struck every few days. We&apos;re on a shortened itinerary because of Ramadan, but most guests will spend two nights on the beach, then move into the Empty Quarter for a further two.  We may be poncy short-breakers, but the more we talk in the car, the more Mike sounds like a match for Thesiger or Lawrence. He came to Oman aged 23 to join the army and help to fight the communist insurgency (&apos;my mother was horrified - she kept screaming &quot;mercenary! You&apos;re going to be a mercenary!&quot; My dad said, &quot;you couldn&apos;t point out Oman in the school atlas with a pitchfork!&quot;&apos;). He spent a full year sitting on a sand dune guarding the Yemen border, passing the time listening to Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, learning to be a great raconteur and inventing elaborate euphemisms for bodily functions (&apos;I&apos;m just off to shed a tear for Milosevic&apos;).  An hour-and-a-half later we arrive at a crescent-shaped bay, where the Arabian Sea crashes against the white sand, framed at either end by black volcanic outcrops. Stately brown canvas tents are spread out along the curve of the bay, their porches facing the waves, and in the centre is a majlis, a covered but open-sided sitting area, full of cushions. It&apos;s 32C but there&apos;s a delicious sea breeze.  After lunch we lounge about, then go out by boat to snorkel. Four dolphins swim up alongside - although they scarper when we flop into the water.  When we return to our tents, which have proper beds, carpets, stacks of fluffy towels and robes, they are lit with hurricane lamps. The sun is setting on the Jebel Qara, the mountain range that runs parallel to the coast and saw fierce fighting between insurgents and the Sultan&apos;s army, supported by the British SAS. Communist rebels used to throw dissidents to their deaths from the cliffs, but tonight the range is beautifully silhouetted against the purple sky and, ooh, don&apos;t mind if I do, here&apos;s a nice cool vodka cocktail.  A long table, cloth held in place by ornate miniature weights, has been set up on the beach and is surrounded by flaming torches and bedecked in candles. Frankincense smoke billows across from a little charcoal burner. It&apos;s all quite overwhelmingly beautiful for our first night, although as Mike points out: &apos;A beach is a beach; the Empty Quarter is the jewel in our crown.&apos; We set off at 6am, heading west from Salalah along the coastline. Flamingos stand in the shallows of Mughsail Beach, a three-mile stretch of white sand with high cliffs, draped in morning mist, at either end. Mike tells us an old Arab saying: &apos;Rise early, for the hour after dawn is borrowed from paradise.&apos; The road swoops and soars through the mountains, barren and empty but for the occasional gnarled and stunted frankincense tree. Their resin, which slowly oozes out and forms into little translucent gobbets, was once more valuable than gold and made this the world&apos;s richest area in 1000BC. The trees look wild, but the sap from each is still harvested. The stuff sold in the souk in Salalah is the best quality available (though quite what I&apos;m going to do with the five packets I brought home is another matter.)  The tarmac soon gives out and we descend into a succession of wadis, whose pebbly floors have been worn by ancient rivers and now carry the bumpy roads.  We&apos;re a few miles from the Yemeni border, heading north, when we come to a barrier across the road. A soldier emerges from a hut, and approaches the car, machine gun in hand. He&apos;s suspicious: few vehicles pass this way, probably none containing five white, grinning, Europeans. He asks us what we&apos;re doing, where we&apos;re going, what arms we are carrying. Mike starts talking in fluent Arabic, then produces his identity card.  It works like Dr Who&apos;s magic paper. Suddenly the soldier&apos;s demeanour changes, he snaps upright and salutes. It turns out Mike is still in the army, a lieutenant colonel no less (running the tour company occupies his lengthy periods of leave). The same thing happens three more times that day. Perhaps we would eventually have got through without Lt Col Wilson - this area isn&apos;t officially off-limits - but I&apos;m not sure. The desert flattens out, all shade vanishes and the temperature climbs to 39C. We could rig up an awning between the two 4x4s and have lunch under that, but instead Mike calls ahead on the satellite phone to the barracks at Al Mazyunah, a dusty frontier town a couple of miles from the Yemen border crossing.  Suddenly we find ourselves out of the baking, dusty desert, and walking across the deep-pile burgundy carpet of the air-conditioned officers&apos; mess, deserted on account of Ramadan. Four AK47s are decoratively attached to the walls, beside floor-to ceiling portraits of the Sultan and some smartly upholstered yellow armchairs. I did say this was quite a surreal holiday.  Lunch is seafood quiche, after which we retire to the games room to play snooker on the full size table. Between turns we look out of the window at the pancake-flat plains that presage the start of the Empty Quarter&apos;s dunes.  The road gets more and more bumpy for a few hours, then we turn off it altogether, driving across the desert trusting GPS co-ordinates to find the camp that Sean has set up. We are speeding across the sand, the dunes beginning to rear up beside us, when suddenly a pick-up truck appears alongside, its driver motioning for us to stop. Two armed men get down - more soldiers, scrambled after we passed a lookout post miles back. They have been following the plume of dust from our wheels.  Twenty minutes later, we arrive at perhaps the world&apos;s most isolated luxury camp. People rush out and present us with cold towels and drinks. It feels like coming upon a colonial-era expedition - we have a retinue of no fewer than 14. No wonder this is such a phenomenally expensive trip - at least \u00a3500 per person per day, not including flights.  After sundowners, we sit down for an alfresco dinner. As I pull my chair out I notice a scorpion, completely white, sitting where I was about to put my feet. I squeal. Mike, who sleeps outside without a tent, comes over laughing and stands on it with his flip-flop, but the poncy British press eat with our feet up on the table legs. Later, as we sit round the fire, a camel spider, six inches across, runs between us at great speed. Sean reassures us they are harmless, but when a second and a third scoot past I bolt up and stand on my chair. I don&apos;t think Thesiger would have thought much of me. After dinner we wander away from camp to look up at the mess of stars. Mike is in wistful mood: &apos;I love it, I never get tired of this. Well, as long as I&apos;ve got some booze with me.&apos; I get up at first light to climb the dune and take some photos. But my camera&apos;s got sand in it and the lens won&apos;t open, so I&apos;m forced to sit without distraction and wait for the sun. Faced with a moment of such cliched perfection, I&apos;m slightly at a loss - coming here on such a whistlestop pilgrimage puts you under a terrible pressure to feel something meaningful on command. This is it, the jewel in the crown, the view we&apos;ve taken two flights and a 10-hour drive on desert tracks to reach, the sight that tourists are being asked to pay \u00a33,000 to glimpse. I stare into the distance, feeling distinctly emotionally constipated. To be brutally honest, it&apos;s just a load of dunes - and dunes that are strikingly similar to ones you can see in lots of easier-to reach spots.  But a faint laugh from the waking camp far below distracts me, and I realise that of course there is something truly special here. Our little camp is the only sign of human life for miles, and in a few hours that will be gone, my footprints will be erased by the wind and I&apos;ll be back in London. That contrast prompts a sort of emperor&apos;s new clothes realisation, albeit in reverse: the whole point is that there&apos;s nothing there. It&apos;s as if all those soldiers were protecting an ever more scarce and precious resource - complete, silent, empty space.

The Everton captain was among the substitutes last Wednesday as England slipped to a 2-1 defeat in Russia that left their place in next summer&apos;s finals hanging by a thread. Should Russia beat Israel in Tel Aviv on November 17, they will secure a spot in Austria and Switzerland at England&apos;s expense four days later by overcoming the Group E whipping boys Andorra. It is a bleak scenario and would mean England failing to reach a major finals for the first time since they sat out the 1994 World Cup. If such an event unfolded, it would almost certainly cost Steve McClaren his job and leave the Football Association looking for their third England manager in the space of 18 months. However, Neville is not as pessimistic as some. &quot;I still believe we will qualify,&quot; he said. &quot;I think Israel will do us a favour against Russia and I am still really positive we will get through.&quot; The worry for McClaren and his men is that Israel, with nothing to play for, will lack motivation, allowing the Russia coach, Guus Hiddink ,to add another notable entry on his impressive CV. Events in Tel Aviv will certainly overshadow England&apos;s friendly in Austria on November 16 and could render their final group game against Croatia at Wembley virtually meaningless. However, one thing the 30-year-old Neville is not blaming for that is the Luzhniki Stadium&apos;s notorious synthetic pitch, on which England were beaten last week. &quot;I thought the pitch was unbelievable,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone loved playing on it.

But these allowances are made available to me to do my job as the democratically elected MP. Halfon ignores the fact that such resources are also available to all Conservative MPs and not to their Labour and Lib Dem opponents. He is concerned that &quot;My MP regularly writes letters to members of the public&quot;. My constituents would be rightly concerned if I didn&apos;t write to them. Taking up constituents&apos; concerns and responding to local issues are important aspects of any MP&apos;s role. Are my constituents to presume that, if they elect Halfon, he won&apos;t be writing to them? MPs&apos; allowances are criticised by Halfon even though he knows that they cannot be used for party-political advertising purposes. Items paid for from the allowances are vetted by an independent officer in the Parliamentary Fees Office to ensure the rules are adhered to. The debate about the Ashcroft money is not a &quot;red herring&quot; when it is this money and that from other Tory financiers that is creating the unlevel playing field in marginal seats like Harlow. In recent years, since it became compulsory for donations to be declared to the Electoral Commission, the Conservative party in Harlow has received \u00a3143,229. The bulk of this has come from Tory financiers such as Ashcroft and corporations with registered offices as far afield as the British Virgin Islands, Tel Aviv and New York. In contrast, Harlow Labour party in the same period has received \u00a314,375, most of which has come from trade unions with branch links in Harlow. This huge funding imbalance enables my Tory opponent to pay for glossy mailings and weekly front-page party-political advertisements in the local papers. In Harlow the Tories have been paying for these adverts for over two years, and no one vets what they print. Corporations have always made donations to political parties at national level. But the Ashcroft money is being poured into a small number of marginal constituencies in an attempt to buy the seat. Most of the donors have no interest in or connection to the constituencies. More worryingly, Ashcroft and the other corporate donors are hand-picking which candidates they support, raising questions about their independence should they be elected. Would these Tory MPs be there to represent their constituents or the interests of Ashcroft? I don&apos;t believe people want financiers to be able to buy parliamentary seats. It&apos;s not levelling the playing field as Halfon contends but a dangerous distortion of our democracy. I admit to having a vested interest as a Labour MP on the receiving end of this financial avalanche. But I believe most reasonable people will be worried about the impact of this on our politics.

Control orders are currently in operation against 14 individuals, including eight British citizens, according to the Home Office. Four of those live in the London area. Three of the 14 have absconded - one in January 2007 and two in May 2007. One more absconded in June 2007 but his control order expired on 31 July 2007. Another three have previously absconded. One out of the 30 has had his assets frozen. One of the &quot;abscondees&quot; is in police custody. There are reporting restrictions against naming many of those subjected to the controversial orders. Here are some of the key cases. JJ, KK, GG, HH, NN and LL  These are six of the 10 men at the heart of the House of Lords challenge over whether or not the control order regime breaches the right to liberty. All the men were described in court to be Iraqi nationals although one of them, LL, insists he is Iranian. He later absconded and the BBC won a legal battle to name him as Bestun Salim. Mr Salim is accused of links to the late insurgent leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and was the first placed under an order to abscond, disappearing from his flat in Manchester in August 2006. The men were all originally held under the Terrorism Act 2000, then released, redetained pending deportation, and finally placed under control orders. In their joint appeal, the men said the control orders breached their right to liberty because the regime contradicted protections against unreasonable detention in human rights law. Their control orders included 18-hour curfews and severe restrictions on their movements. E E is Tunisian but stateless and one of the first placed under an order. He lives with his family in north-west London. His order was taken out on 12 March 2005, the day after the legislation came into force. Before then, he had been held in prison without charge, under the system subsequently ruled illegal by the law lords. The control order was renewed in March 2006 - but he then challenged its further renewal in February 2007. In the original order, the home secretary said E was a member of the Tunisian Fighting Group and actively supported people involved in terrorism. One particular intelligence allegation links him to people blamed for the assassination in Afghanistan of a senior enemy of the Taliban and to al-Qaida days before the 9/11 attacks on the US. MB and AF MB is a naturalised British citizen who was made subject to a control order in September 2005. Police stopped him at Manchester Airport in March 2005 as he tried to board a flight for Syria. After being released, he was stopped the following day at Heathrow from where he was thought to be heading to Yemen. The security services believed MB was planning to fight in Iraq, the home secretary said. MB is single and his control order restricts him to a home in South Yorkshire. He took his case to the high court last April, claiming that the manner in which he was placed under the restrictions breached his right to a fair trial. AF is a dual UK-Libyan national who lives in Manchester. He was put under a control order on 2 June 2006. He has a banking degree and had previously planned to be an accountant in the UK. He is divorced and has a fiancee in Libya. The home secretary alleged that he was linked to extremists in Manchester who were members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Zeeshan Siddiqui - previously known as AD A former tube worker who was allegedly approached to become a suicide bomber on the London underground. He is one of the men who absconded and his anonymity order was lifted in June, after an application by the Guardian. Mr Siddiqui, 26, escaped from a mental health unit in Hounslow, west London, last October, after jumping out of a window. During a terrorism trial, in which five men were jailed for plotting a series of fertiliser bomb attacks in the south-east of England, the jury heard that Mr Siddiqui - referred to as Imran - was asked to carry out a suicide attack on the underground, where he worked as a cleaner. Mr Siddiqui, the son of a Heathrow airport worker and a supply teacher, was born in London and grew up in Hounslow in the west of the city. He became involved with al-Muhajiroun, the Islamist organisation established by Omar Bakri Muhammad, the fundamentalist cleric banned from re-entering Britain in the wake of the July 7 attacks in London. Among his friends, both at college and in al-Muhajiroun, was Asif Hanif, who killed himself and three others in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv in May 2003. Mr Siddiqui, who has a history of mental illness, vanished from his home shortly after that attack. He is now known to have travelled to Pakistan, where he has attended terrorism training camps. He trained alongside members of the fertiliser gang. Mr Siddiqui was arrested in May 2005 in Peshawar by the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI, and later alleged that he underwent weeks of torture. The control order was imposed when he was eventually freed and deported to the UK. Lamine and Ibrahim Adam, and Cerie Bullivant The Adam brothers and Bullivant were named by Scotland Yard in May after they failed to report to police. Lamine Adam, 26, and Ibrahim Adam, 20, are the brothers of Anthony Garcia, 25, who was jailed for life in April after being convicted at the Old Bailey of conspiring to commit a terrorist attack in Britain. The Adam family live in Ilford, east London, and are of Algerian origin. Bullivant, 24, is also from Dagenham, east London. He was formerly known as AG. Lamine Adam was repeatedly mentioned as an associate of those convicted during the &quot;fertiliser bomb&quot; terrorism trial, which exposed plots to blow up Bluewater shopping centre, the Ministry of Sound nightclub and synagogues. A key witness alleged that Lamine Adam was planning a separate attack on a British target. He worked for London Underground alongside Mr Siddiqui. On at least two previous occasions, Bullivant had been granted bail by a senior district judge. The Adams brothers were put under control orders in February 2006, while Bullivant&apos;s control order was issued in July last year.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-31T16:49:51Z", "title": "The control order detainees", "sentences": ["Among his friends, both at college and in al-Muhajiroun, was Asif Hanif, who killed himself and three others in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv in May 2003."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/31/terrorism.politics1"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Budget travel"], "article": "Revellers in Rabin Square, in Israel&apos;s 24-hour party city, Tel Aviv. Photograph: Havakuk Levison/Corbis Uzi Gafni, the head of the Israeli tourist board, proclaims himself &quot;delighted&quot; with the news. The budget airline Thomsonfly has introduced the first low-fare flights from the UK to Israel&apos;s &quot;24-hour party city&quot;, Tel Aviv. Ancient ruins plus clubs galore, beaches and a museum of the Jewish diaspora could now be yours in a single city break for a lead-in fare of \u00a3139.98 return. Passengers begin making the four-hour flights, from Luton and Manchester, today. Actually, &quot;news&quot; is not quite right as far as the Israeli government is concerned because, as is often the way with these things, the tourist board itself has helped to bring the budget flights into being, by covering a percentage of Thomson&apos;s marketing budget. Why, I ask Mr Gafni, should people go to Tel Aviv? It is, he answers, not only a &quot;business centre&quot; but also a centre of culture. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra is based there; there is an embarrassment of restaurants and bars; you can wander around the intriguing neighbourhood of Old Jaffa; and Jerusalem and the Dead Sea are a mere drive away. It is, Mr Gafni says, the &quot;ideal city break&quot;. More broadly, Israel itself has one of the highest concentrations of World Heritage Sights in the world, and that would have been far more of a draw to tourists already were it not for the violence with which the region is also intimately associated. On that point, I ask Mr Gafni, is Tel Aviv safe? &quot;I live there,&quot; he replies, &quot;and you can walk down the street at night without fear.&quot; He has, apparently, misunderstood me. I don&apos;t mean crime; I mean bombs.  Travellers face such dangers elsewhere in the world, Mr Gafni points out, and adds that there have been no attacks in Tel Aviv for a year. Guy Stephenson, from Thomsonfly, argues that Egypt, Turkey and Morocco have suffered more from terrorism recently, although he concedes the perception remains that Israel is particularly badly afflicted.  But he claims that this is precisely what his airline&apos;s budget fares could remedy. Once the first visitors have descended upon Tel Aviv, discover what an exciting city it is and return home to spread the news, the exaggerated perception of eternal enmity and strife will begin to crumble. None of these arguments, of course, will convince people who abjure travel to Israel because of the country&apos;s stance on Palestine. Yet travel could form part of the very solution to that grievous conflict. Modern, money-generating tourism, with its clich\u00e9 bromides, might be precisely what is needed to lull the warring parties into passive prosperity.

Perlman, especially in America, is not just a famous musician, he is the famous musician for millions of people - the personification of classical music. So while you can trace his life and career through acclaimed recordings, legendary concerts and learned articles, you can also view his progress through half a century of popular culture via clips on YouTube. There is plenty of footage of Perlman in concert white tie and tails, performing solo or with major orchestras all over the world. But more striking is his American debut in 1958 on the Ed Sullivan television show, aged just 13 and newly arrived from Israel, his childhood polio forcing him to sit while he played Mendelssohn&apos;s violin concerto. Then there&apos;s Perlman on Sesame Street - playing a Beethoven duet with the Telly Monster on tuba - or performing John Williams&apos;s Oscar-winning Schindler&apos;s List score at the Academy Awards ceremony, or introducing the three tenors concert at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Just a few weeks ago, Perlman was the avuncular host of the live network television opening of the new Lincoln centre season in New York. &quot;Television was how I came to the States and I&apos;ve always felt very comfortable doing it,&quot; he explains. &quot;Of course, there are battles. Television will always err on the side of making something not quite as classy as it could be. I try to put my foot down because people in the mass media often don&apos;t give audiences credit. To bring a large audience to a piece of serious music and make it accessible does not mean reducing it in any way. And I&apos;ve learned that if something is good, even if it is a little difficult, people will get that it is good.&quot; Perlman will be in the UK later this month performing Schubert, Beethoven and Strauss at Birmingham Symphony Hall (November 11) and the Barbican (November 13). But he says that, in recent years, playing music has been only a part of his creative life. Conducting and, perhaps most importantly, teaching have become increasingly important. They came together at the prestigious annual summer school for young musicians organised by Perlman&apos;s wife of 40 years, Toby Friedlander, when she asked him to coach the orchestra. &quot;In fact, &apos;coach&apos; was a code word for conduct. But I turned up and used a pencil rather than a baton to make the point that I wasn&apos;t conducting. However, we did get some good results and that&apos;s how it started for real. And the conducting and the teaching have changed the way I think about music and the way I play. In retrospect, I see that it was very logical and predictable that each would complement the other. There&apos;s a lot of teaching in conducting, a lot of conducting in playing, and a lot of playing in teaching.&quot; Perlman is speaking in a non descript studio in the Juilliard School of Music in New York, where he was a student from the age of 13 under the legendary teachers Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay. He has taught there himself since 1999. Although there are a few photos on the wall of him with the likes of Pavarotti and Isaac Stern, he says that this room was, and to some extent remains, &quot;Miss DeLay&apos;s studio. Nothing much has changed. This is her desk and chair, and that closet still has a bunch of stuff that is hers. There are even the dolls she had for the younger students. It&apos;s a little bit spooky.&quot; He has followed DeLay&apos;s teaching technique, which he describes as essentially consultative. &quot;She believed in involving the student in the process. She asked students what they thought about the performance and how it might be improved. I&apos;m the same in that I like to analyse why something is good or not so good. But when I first came here, Mr Galamian was very different. &apos;Do this, do that, that&apos;s no good, change that.&apos; He&apos;d say if we did as he told us we&apos;d play the fiddle. There was no debate. It was a more old-fashioned way of doing things, which was much closer to my first teacher in Israel, Mrs Goldgart. I started off when I was around five and studied with her for eight years. While I don&apos;t teach in the same way, I think she was very good and I appreciate what she did for me.&quot; Perlman was born in Tel Aviv in 1945, and while he shies away from the word &quot;prodigy&quot;, there is no getting way from his precociousness. He gave his first solo recital aged 10 and was soon appearing with the Israel Broadcasting Orchestra. Such was his burgeoning reputation that when superstar violinists such as Jascha Heifetz or Isaac Stern were passing through, he was asked to play for them. And then came the Ed Sullivan invitation. &quot;What&apos;s interesting is that, up to the age of 13, I was exposed to hardly any recordings,&quot; he says. &quot;When we lived in Israel, we didn&apos;t even own a record player. But we did listen to the radio at atime when the radio played a lot of classical music. I particularly remember listening to H eifetz and Ida Haendel, who was very popular in Israel. Then we came to the States, registered for a record club that sent us an LP every month, and the explosion really started.&quot; He remembers endlessly playing a series of 78s by Fritz Kreisler, but says that while &quot;it was good to put something else in my ear which gave me a new sort of sound, the really important thing is not to latch on to one particular favourite and try to imitate them. There are people who get a sound implanted in their brain and then can&apos;t play any other way. It&apos;s a real shame.&quot; Perlman makes a point of exposing his students to archive recordings in an eff ort to teach them &quot;where they came from. Unless you are aware of this heritage, your style of playing can become very narrow. It doesn&apos;t mean you have to slide like Kreisler used to slide, but it&apos;s good to know that&apos;s what they did back then. It&apos;s very easy to be technically brilliant in the modern manner and not realise that you could still make a sound so pure it ends up like white bread.&quot; But when viewing some of the videos of great performers he admired as a young musician, Perlman has found himself doubting his own youthful judg ment. &quot;When you go back to these fi lms of Heifetz or Oistrakh, they are not always as good as you remember. Either I am becoming a miserable grouch or I have learnt a few things along the way. But that doesn&apos;t mean they weren&apos;t important to me at the time; on lots of occasions they were very helpful to me.&quot; There was never a doubt in his own mind that he would become a professional musician, but he says his polio - today he uses a combination of walking sticks and an electric wheelchair - prompted people to question whether he could travel enough to have a career. &quot;But for me, and for my family, it never had anything to do with being disabled or anything like that. We always figured that the way you make a career is through the quality of your performance.&quot; He made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1963 and won the prestigious Leventritt competition the following year. The prize was to play with the New York Philharmonic and Cleveland orchestras. &quot;And then the rest was up to me. The challenge is not getting a fi rst date, it&apos;s getting a second date. I was aware that I had to prove myself constantly. In my fi rst season, I had 15 dates and in my second season 20. The third season I had 35 and that meant I was doing something right. That&apos;s basically been the story till today.&quot; Perlman has gone on to win 16 Grammy awards, and three Emmys for music television programmes. He has even sung - &quot;for about 20 seconds. It was my farewell debut&quot; - on James Levine&apos;s recording of Tosca starring Renata Scotto and Placido Domingo. He has been involved with comparatively little contemporary music, although he has had work written for him. &quot;Everybody&apos;s job is to do certain things,&quot; he says. &quot;And anyway, sometimes music doesn&apos;t have to be newly written to be made new.&quot; His move into conducting echoed his early performing career. &quot;They had no obligation to invite me again after the initial curiosity of wondering whether this guy who plays the violin quite well can conduct. But it&apos;s gone OK.&quot; The similarities between teaching and conducting have been helpful. &quot;I&apos;ve been lucky to conduct the very best or-chestras in the world: New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Berlin, the London Philharmonic. What can you tell them about Brahms two or Beethoven five? So you have to work out in your own mind what you want to hear from a performance. It&apos;s the same with my students. The standard is extremely high, so what on earth do you tell them? You have to really think about it.&quot; He says that encountering young musicians at Juilliard and at the summer school - Maestro Perlman is known as Mr P at both establishments - leaves him cautiously hopeful for the future of serious music. &quot;The level of violin playing is much higher than it has ever been. But maybe establishing a career is more diffi cult. I advise people not to narrow their goals, but to get involved in chamber music and recitals and a little bit of solo work and orchestra and whatever else is going on. The idea that either they play Carnegie Hall or they do nothing is extremely harmful. I also encourage them to teach, even the youngest kids work with beginners, because it does help you as a player.&quot; The only thing he can&apos;t advise on or teach, Perlman says, is whether a musician &quot;can get through to your guts. They have to find that themselves, and some of them never do. Sometimes in this room we break through to that with a student and it sends a chill through your body. The important thing is never to play a piece &apos;because that is the way it goes&apos;. There is no way it goes until you play it. If you can read, then you can recite Shakespeare. But that&apos;s not acting.&quot; He adds that knowing how to play the violin is not playing music: &quot;The Beethoven violin concerto is just a bunch of arpeggios and scales. No mystery there. But if you put your mind in a different groove and tell the story of the music as it reveals itself to you, then you&apos;ve really got something going on.&quot; Inspirations Ryvka GoldgartIvan GalamianDorothy DeLayJascha HeifetzFritz Kreisler", "publicationDate": "2007-11-03T23:42:00Z", "title": "A life in music: Violinist and conductor Itzhak Perlman", "sentences": ["While I don&apos;t teach in the same way, I think she was very good and I appreciate what she did for me.&quot; Perlman was born in Tel Aviv in 1945, and while he shies away from the word &quot;prodigy&quot;, there is no getting way from his precociousness."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/03/classicalmusicandopera.music"}, {"tags": [], "article": "Nobody really knows how much information there is in the world. According to one extremely rough estimate, if you took every book, newspaper, magazine, TV and radio programme, every music album, every handwritten letter, every filed-away document and every other piece of recorded data in existence, and you stored them all on computer hard drives, the amount of disk space you would need would be somewhere in the region of 2,100 exabytes, or 2,100bn gigabytes. If it helps - and it probably doesn&apos;t - this is more than 100m times the amount of data that is thought to be stored, in print form, in the bookstacks of the world&apos;s largest library, the Library of Congress in Washington. What is certain is that only a tiny proportion of all this information is currently available on the internet. We joke darkly that Google knows everything - but even Eric Schmidt, Google&apos;s chief executive, admits that it probably knows less than 10% of everything that is publicly available to be known. Putting all the world&apos;s books and old newspapers and broadcasts on the web is a project of almost unimaginable scale: Schmidt has estimated that it might take another 300 years. Still, a few weeks ago, on the 12th floor of an office building just outside Tel Aviv, a small group of Israeli technologists finished making a modest contribution to that task, by digitising every page of every edition of the Guardian since its launch in 1821 up to the 1970s, along with thousands of editions of the Observer - about 900,000 pages in all. Yoni Stern, co-founder of Olive Software, which carried out the work, is a man of diffident bearing, but his ambitions are not exactly restrained. &quot;For years, I kept thinking, well, what about all this content that isn&apos;t on the internet?&quot; he said on a blazingly hot day in Israel last week. &quot;Maybe, one day, all of the content in the world that was ever created will be connected online. And maybe my destiny is to help this process of connection.&quot; The Guardian Digital Archive, launched today, allows users to search the full text of the newspaper from 1821 to 1975, and the Observer from 1900 to 1975 - the first time a national UK newspaper has made its paper archive available to the public online. The second phase, early next year, will see the addition of the Observer from 1791 to 1899, and both papers from 1976 to 2003. Instead of merely calling up the text of news stories, the system enables users to view articles as they appeared in the newspaper, then to browse the rest of that day&apos;s edition. And so you can, should you wish, discover, on the same front page of the Guardian that reported the abolition of slavery, an advertisement for Lessey&apos;s Carbonated Seidlitz Powder (&quot;recommended for the relief of the nausea, heartburn, debility of the stomach, and other symptoms induced by the heat of the weather&quot;). One side effect of the internet is that it can be almost too easy to find exactly what you want, and to ignore everything else, eliminating the pleasure of finding things you didn&apos;t know you were looking for. The digital archive permits precise searching, of course, but being able to browse entire editions is addictive; it makes searching a newspaper archive far more similar to the experience of reading a newspaper. Recently, I&apos;ve been following a dastardly tale of postal-order forgery in 1960s Manchester - a classic cat-and-mouse game between the police and a shadowy criminal mastermind - but only because I found a report on it a few pages after Alistair Cooke&apos;s front-page splash about the assassination of JFK. &quot;The real brains behind this is a man called John McAllister. I have not yet been able to trace him,&quot; a frustrated Detective Inspector C Mellor grumbled to the Guardian at the time. There is nothing new about computer software which can recognise words on the printed page. This is the technology behind Google&apos;s controversial effort to scan and make searchable at least 15m books at a reported rate of 3,000 a day, including much of the stock of the Oxford and Harvard university libraries. But books are simple things, full of uniformly designed slabs of continuous text. Newspapers, by contrast, are a cacophony of columns, headlines, adverts, photographs, captions, crosswords and weather maps; in earlier centuries, there wasn&apos;t uniformity in the width of a column, or the size of a headline, from one page to the next. If you can&apos;t tell all these elements apart, it&apos;s impossible to build a useful archive. Olive Software&apos;s secret ingredient is its system of &quot;componentisation&quot; - a set of mathematical algorithms that allow its computers to learn how to make sense of the cacophony and thus, in effect, to learn how to read a newspaper. The system acts as a bridge between the electronic realm and the realm of printed words on paper, which Stern has an alarming tendency of referring to as the &quot;legacy world&quot;. Most of the other firms considered for the job by the Guardian proposed a different method of componentisation: they planned to use hundreds of human beings to plough, bleary-eyed, through digital images of every page of the paper, marking by hand where one story stopped and the next one began. Few places belong more definitively to the legacy world than the Stockwell Deep Level Shelter, a former air-raid shelter so far beneath the streets of south London that you can hear underground trains rumbling past overhead. At ground level, it doesn&apos;t look like much: a circular white concrete pillbox building with a blank metal door. But behind the door is a lift-shaft, and at the bottom of the lift-shaft - reached using an old-fashioned cage lift, highly unsuitable for claustrophobics - is an extensive network of tunnels that once accommodated up to 8,000 people at a time. The shelter opened in 1944, offering protection from V-1 flying bombs, and was later used as a camp for soldiers en route through London. It isn&apos;t open to the public, and stepping into the two main tunnels, each nearly half a kilometre long, is unsettling: you get the irrational but distinct feeling that the voices of its wartime occupants might only just have died away. Today, the shelter is operated by the archiving company Recall Total Information Management, which houses many of its customers&apos; boxes of documents on the original six-person metal bed-frames. Among the collections are around 250 leatherbound volumes of the Guardian and Observer, dating back to the early 1800s. (Other volumes are stored in the Newsroom, the paper&apos;s archive and visitor centre.) These very oldest copies demonstrate that paper doesn&apos;t last forever. Even in Stockwell&apos;s dark, cool conditions, the archives are slowly disintegrating: gingerly opening one volume from 1846, I released a cloud of acidic dust which settled all over my clothes. (Underneath the dust, from the top of the front page of Saturday, July 18, 1846, where these days the lead story would be, it read: &quot;Found, a purse, which the owner may have by describing it. Apply at the Clarence Hotel.&quot;) &quot;If you put a copy of today&apos;s Guardian in the strong sunlight for three days, it&apos;ll no longer be white,&quot; says Ed King, head of the British Library&apos;s newspaper collections at Colindale in north London. &quot;What is happening in libraries and archives, as a general phenomenon, is that paper is degrading - more slowly, but the process is normal and inevitable. Controlled temperature and humidity can slow it down, but not eliminate it entirely.&quot; Counterintuitively, the oldest copies of the Guardian are in a better state than some newer ones, because older paper was made largely of fibre from rags. But overall the situation is grave. Fifteen per cent of Colindale&apos;s historic newspapers already can&apos;t be touched by the public, because their condition is too poor. From the 1950s, libraries and newspaper firms thought they had found the solution: microfilm. In his 2001 book Double Fold, the novelist Nicholson Baker launches an unlikely tirade against the practice, accusing an overzealous band of library modernisers, mainly in the US and Britain, of having sold off or destroyed countless shelves of books and newspapers in pursuit of their crazed vision of libraries consisting of rack upon rack of neatly stored rolls of cellulose acetate. The &quot;problem&quot; of libraries, said the leading American microfilm crusader of the 1950s, Verner Clapp, was to prevent the past from &quot;clogging the channels of the present&quot;. His ideas led to the establishment of America&apos;s $358m (\u00a3172m) Brittle Books Program, which saw thousands of books ripped from their bindings in order to be photographed. Baker&apos;s book makes plain the limitations of microfilm: it is fiddly to use, the film stock itself is fatally subject to the effects of ageing, and reading a newspaper on microfilm is nothing like reading one on paper. But even today, it is the only standardised, agreed-upon remedy for dealing with the problem of disintegrating paper, which is why the British Library, despite having launched a major web archive of its 19th-century newspapers, continues to use microfilm. It would be too risky to stop, Ed King argues, while we still can&apos;t be sure that any given digital format is really going to last. Try accessing the data on a 5.25-inch floppy disk these days, or from a file created in the defunct program WordPerfect. And so the newspapers arriving at Colindale each day are dutifully photographed - after having been ironed, to get rid of the folds and crinkles. The Guardian still uses microfilm, too. A full run of the paper is maintained and updated by ProQuest, a Michigan-based company, and it was copies of those rolls of film that were shipped to Israel late last year, to begin the mammoth task of putting the newspapers&apos; archives online. One of the hazards of working for Olive Software, which is busily digitising the archives of scores of newspapers from the US, South America and Europe, is the risk of getting distracted. You might sit down at a computer to adjust the image sharpness on a batch of digitised pages, only to find that it is two hours later, and that you&apos;ve spent the intervening time immersed in coverage of the Battle of the Somme. &quot;My first day of training, I got through two to three pages in the whole day,&quot; said Chezkie Kasnett, a sales manager. &quot;I was, like, &apos;This is just amazing stuff!&apos; I was reading the Irish Times, I think, right around 1942 - the invasion of the allies. Detailed descriptions of the battles. You can very easily get into the material.&quot; Partly as a result, the operators who oversee the automated process on a day-to-day basis, in two shifts of eight hours each, are trained to understand the structure of a newspaper without reading the content - to see it, like the computer does, as a smorgasbord of jostling components. &quot;If you had to start reading material to understand it, a project would take us decades,&quot; said Kasnett. &quot;We did have one operator who would read every newspaper,&quot; his colleague, Yael Arbel, recalled. &quot;He is no longer an operator.&quot; Olive likes to describe its process as a hybrid of human and machine - 80% automated, but with real people providing a level of accuracy that computers still can&apos;t attain. Their offices, in a palm-lined business park in Hod Hasharon, north-east of Tel Aviv, are essentially a conveyor-belt for information. The rolls of microfilm are scanned onto computers by human operators, then cleaned up by computer with human assistance. Then - the heart of the process - the pages are divided up into components in Olive&apos;s password-protected server room, where banks of processors hum 24 hours a day, processing up to 1m pages a month. What emerges at the other end are images of newspaper pages covered with translucent rectangles of different colours, each intended to identify a different story, advertisement or other element. These images are inspected by still more humans, to correct the computers&apos; mistakes. Text recognition comes last. For 20th and 21st century newspapers, the process is relatively simple: when I visited, the system had no problem reading almost every word of a Guardian front page featuring reports from 1950s Rhodesia by the foreign correspondents Hella Pick and Ian Aitken. For older editions, it is more of a challenge, and for some European newspapers, printed in Gothic text, the character recognition software has had to be significantly rewritten. The finished data is stored in standard graphics files and in the simple, general-purpose, open-access computer language, XML - part of an effort to increase its lifespan as technology changes. The sheer volume of data required that the Guardian archive be shipped to the paper&apos;s headquarters in London on hard drives, not DVDs. Yoni Stern&apos;s co-founder is a professorial Russian computer scientist named Emil Shteinvil, who emigrated after the collapse of communism with three children, no ability to speak English or Hebrew and, he says, $300 in his pocket. Like the firm&apos;s other senior staff, he makes no pretence of being interested solely in the technical side of things. &quot;This is history, OK?&quot; he said, over lunch in the building&apos;s communal canteen. &quot;You can feel all this life, and this is very interesting! You can see all about this war, this election, this day! You can see a piece of writing on how to care for your slaves!&quot; For Stephen Marks, the London-born executive who runs Olive&apos;s Israel offices, the digitisation of the world&apos;s newspaper archives promises nothing less - though he is biased, naturally - than a transformation of the concept of history. &quot;History is written by the victors, and then history books are authored, and then they&apos;re put on a syllabus,&quot; he said. Conventional wisdom gets entrenched. But give people direct access to a multiplicity of viewpoints from the time of the events themselves, and everything changes. &quot;It&apos;s not that newspapers don&apos;t have an ideology; it&apos;s that there are lots of them. The bombing of Dresden: how was that being reported from the UK? From Dresden?&quot; &quot;A newspaper today might be full of bullshit,&quot; says Yoni Stern, &quot;but it&apos;s all a part of the history of culture - the bullshit, too, no less than the reality. You can&apos;t get that from history books.&quot; From Olive&apos;s offices, you can look down over eastern Israel, across to Palestinian villages and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and a chainlink portion of the hugely controversial security barrier. When you do, it suddenly seems no coincidence that this technology reached its zenith in Israel, where conflicting versions of history permeate present-day life so completely. Digitisation represents &quot;a big opening-up of history,&quot; Marks said. &quot;For the last 350 years or so, we&apos;ve recorded our history by the day, from all sorts of different viewpoints, but it&apos;s always been hard to get at before now. This is like the Dead Sea Scrolls for the last few centuries of humanity.&quot; The Guardian, so far, has documented 186 of those years.

Rival protesters screamed insults at each other outside Rimonim Prison as the ceremony took place. The ceremony capped a saga that has caused turmoil in Israel since the baby was born last week. Rabin&apos;s family, and much of the public, opposed a court decision allowing assassin Yigal Amir to attend the circumcision of his son, while a vocal group of Israeli ultra-nationalists voiced solidarity with Amir. &quot;He killed a prime minister - he is not like any other murderer,&quot; said Matan Josefor-Berg, 25. &quot;He tried to destroy our democracy by assassinating Rabin.&quot; When Amir&apos;s wife and baby arrived in a grey van protesters started shouting. The baby&apos;s face was concealed behind a white blanket as a crowd of photographers swarmed around, pushing at each other to get a picture of the child. The circumcision came a day after more than 100,000 Israelis gathered to remember Rabin and condemn his killer at the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv where Amir, an Orthodox Jew, assassinated Rabin after a peace rally on 4 November, 1995, because he opposed the prime minister&apos;s policy of ceding land for peace with the Palestinians. Amir was sentenced to life in prison and has been held in isolation since. But over the past year, he has been permitted conjugal visits with his wife, Larissa Trimbobler, whom he married while in prison. The boy was born last week, and according to Jewish tradition, a Jewish male is circumcised eight days after his birth. An Israeli court rejected a request by Amir to leave jail to attend his son&apos;s circumcision, but said the ceremony could take place inside his prison. The birth comes at a time of growing sympathy for Amir. Israeli extremists and Amir&apos;s family have launched a campaign to have him released from prison, and a recent newspaper poll indicated that about a quarter of Israelis, including almost half of religiously observant Jews, think Amir should be pardoned in 2015 after serving 20 years.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-05T00:02:38Z", "title": "Rabin assassin's son circumcised in prison amid furious protest", "sentences": ["The circumcision came a day after more than 100,000 Israelis gathered to remember Rabin and condemn his killer at the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv where Amir, an Orthodox Jew, assassinated Rabin after a peace rally on 4 November, 1995, because he opposed the prime minister&apos;s policy of ceding land for peace with the Palestinians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/05/israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "On Saturday evening, as I have done every year since that fatal night 12 years ago, I went to Rabin Square in the heart of Tel Aviv, opposite the municipality, to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It feels like a tribal ritual, but it is an act I am compelled to carry out each year, whatever the weather or my own state of mind or wellbeing. I was there on the night of November 4, 1995, 12 years ago. At the time there was a feeling that we were taking the streets back from the extremists on the right. The former Tel Aviv mayor Shlomo Lahat was the head of the organising committee, and the French Jewish philanthropist Jean Friedman also played a major part. As a member of the national leadership forum of the Peace Now movement, our role was to help bring out the demonstrators. There had been concern that not enough people would come, and that perhaps there would be hostile snipers stationed on the rooftops around the square - but the people came, over 100,000, to take back the night from the rejectionist forces of darkness. I remember being particularly upbeat after Rabin spoke. He was not a great speaker, and tended frequently to place the wrong emphases within his sentences, perhaps due to the fact that he had never totally gotten used to the necessities of public life. This time, I remarked to those around me, he spoke well, perhaps gaining strength from the masses below him. His call for peace and against violence, with his familiar deep voice, sounded as if it was expressed from the depths of his being. And at the end, he even seemed to smile as he sang Shir Lashalom, (Song for Peace) together with blond singer Miri Aloni and the other politicians on the platform. In recent years, the memorial gathering has always begun with a video image and recording of excerpts from Rabin&apos;s final speech, followed by the chilling announcement by his bureau chief Eitan Haber that &quot;the Government of Israel, announces, with astonishment, that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has been shot, killed by a Jewish assassin.&quot; This time, the 12th anniversary of that tragic night, 150,000 gathered in the square, the largest number in recent years. Perhaps they were motivated to come as a counterpoint to the fact that the assassin, Yigal Amir, was about to celebrate the birth of a son in prison. And perhaps they came to demonstrate an expression of hope as we near the Annapolis Conference, another crossroads in the quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace. One of the signs that floated over the square read: &quot;Olmert, the time has come to decide.&quot; And perhaps they came to gain strength from each other. The oldest demonstrator, at the age of 91-plus, was probably Fiska, the legendary cultural impresario, who ran the Tzavta Club for progressive culture and politics for many years, and used to record five hours of performances for Israeli television in its infancy in the late 60s and early 70s. He is always there, at every memorial demonstration. But the most encouraging element of this demonstration was the fact that the clear majority of the crowd were teenagers or in their early 20s. As both President Shimon Peres, who was at Rabin&apos;s side as his foreign minister on that other night 12 years ago, and Rabin&apos;s son Yuval said looking out at the audience - you, the younger generation are the key to the future. Perhaps there will be some in the audience who will take those words seriously, and will consider their presence at the evening a formative experience in their lives. There were veterans who have been burned out from too many demonstrations and too few results, who decided not to come. And there were others who didn&apos;t like the fact that Labor party leader and defence minister Ehud Barak was one of the invited speakers. The Meretz party held up signs saying: &quot;Barak, you have fogotten Rabin&apos;s legacy.&quot; In response, for the first time since his return to politics, Barak declared that the Annapolis Conference was an opportunity, and that he was committed to seeking peace. The most interesting moment in the evening took place in the middle of the speech by the Orthodox religious mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski. His appearance was a surprise, and an anomaly amid the overwhelmingly secular speakers, singers and crowd. Lupolianski decided to remind the audience that two weeks before his death, Rabin had declared that the one thing that unites all Israelis is their belief in a united Jerusalem. He then paused ... and was greeted by total silence. Not a single clap. If he had said this in Jerusalem, or at a rightwing rally, he would have been greeted by thunderous applause. But here, in the heart of Tel Aviv, just silence. A silence which projects hope for the future. People are tired of slogans, and want solutions that work. Peres was tired, Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai said the correct educational words reading from a text, Barak was clearly uncomfortable, trying to recapture the support of the camp he lost when he declared that there was no Palestinian partner for peace, and when he ran away from politics to make money. The singers sang their songs, to give peace a chance. And the powerful emotional tone was set by Yuval Rabin. Everyone wanted to quote the Song for Peace. But Peres and Lupolianski were only capable of quoting the first lines: &quot;Let the sun rise / and the morning bring forth its light.&quot; The younger Rabin had the courage to conclude his presentation with the final words of the second verse: &quot;Don&apos;t say that a day will come / Bring forth that day / And in all the city squares / Shout only peace.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-06T08:00:00Z", "title": "At Rabin Square, 12 years on", "sentences": ["On Saturday evening, as I have done every year since that fatal night 12 years ago, I went to Rabin Square in the heart of Tel Aviv, opposite the municipality, to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.", "The former Tel Aviv mayor Shlomo Lahat was the head of the organising committee, and the French Jewish philanthropist Jean Friedman also played a major part.", "But here, in the heart of Tel Aviv, just silence.", "Peres was tired, Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai said the correct educational words reading from a text, Barak was clearly uncomfortable, trying to recapture the support of the camp he lost when he declared that there was no Palestinian partner for peace, and when he ran away from politics to make money."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/atrabinsquare12yearslater"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Gaza"], "article": "Khaled al-Mudallal expected to spend this autumn sitting in lectures and writing papers for his final year in business and management studies in Bradford, the town he has lived in for six years. But when Mr Mudallal, 22, went home to visit his wife and family in Gaza this summer he found himself trapped. Within a few days of his return Hamas, the Islamist movement which won Palestinian elections last year, seized control of the Gaza Strip. Israel closed the crossings out of Gaza and six weeks ago declared the small stretch of land a &quot;hostile entity&quot;. He is one of 670 Palestinian students in Gaza with places on university courses abroad who are unable to return to their studies. Supported by an Israeli human rights group, Gisha, the students have brought a second petition to Israel&apos;s supreme court demanding the right to travel after a first petition was rejected. A response is expected today. &quot;This is my final year, it counts for 70% of my degree. It&apos;s the most important year of my life,&quot; said Mr Mudallal. &quot;I feel I&apos;ve been denied my right to education, my right of movement.&quot; He moved to Bradford as a teenager to join his father, who was studying at the city&apos;s university. He went to school and then on to the university&apos;s school of management. He returned to Gaza last December to marry and came back again this summer to bring his wife, Dua&apos;a, to Bradford for his final year. He has a visa for Britain that runs until 2010. However, because the crossings were closed he had to cancel a one-year paid placement at a Bradford charity that was part of his course and is still paying \u00a3300 a month rent on his flat in the city. &quot;We&apos;re living in limbo,&quot; he said. The Israeli government has allowed a limited number of Palestinians to leave Gaza through the Erez border crossing, which leads into Israel, and from there on to Tel Aviv airport or overland into Jordan. In August, Israel began taking students out through Erez and driving them by bus to the Nitzana crossing, which leads into Egypt. However the bus ran only four times, allowing fewer than 550 people to leave, of whom about 80 were students. It has not run since early September. Mr Mudallal&apos;s first petition to the supreme court, on September 17, was rejected because the court was told the bus service would resume. It did not. There are now 6,400 Palestinians waiting to leave Gaza and Mr Mudallal is number 4,845 on the waiting list. Mark Regev, Israel&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, said: &quot;We are working to find an expeditious solution. We want them to go and study and help build a better future for the Palestinians.&quot; Many others fear losing their university places. Mona Bkheet, 26, won a scholarship for a PhD on civil engineering at Southern Illinois University, in Carbondale. When she came home to Gaza for the summer, she too found herself trapped. Hassan el-Nabih, 46, who won a place at Boston College, in Boston, Massachusetts, to study a PhD in linguistics under a US government scholarship for Palestinian university academics has a US visa that runs until June 2010 and a permit to cross through Israel from Gaza, but was twice turned back when trying to leave.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-06T14:16:12Z", "title": "Closure of crossings traps students in Gaza", "sentences": ["The Israeli government has allowed a limited number of Palestinians to leave Gaza through the Erez border crossing, which leads into Israel, and from there on to Tel Aviv airport or overland into Jordan."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/06/israel"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Tottenham Hotspur"], "article": "Dimitar Berbatov&apos;s future at Tottenham Hotspur appears increasingly uncertain after Juande Ramos last night declared that he had no intention of keeping an unsettled player. The Tottenham coach&apos;s comments will fuel speculation that Berbatov might be sold despite Tottenham&apos;s sporting director, Damien Comolli, insisting earlier in the week that the Bulgarian was not seeking to move to another club in January and that he remained part of Ramos&apos;s plans. That might be the case in the short term, with Berbatov likely to partner Robbie Keane against Hapoel Tel Aviv tonight, but there will need to be a radical change in the player&apos;s attitude if he is to start next season at the club. &quot;I believe you can&apos;t force players to stay in the team if they don&apos;t want to,&quot; said Ramos. &quot;It is not good for the team or the player, so I wouldn&apos;t stand in anyone&apos;s way if they want to leave. I think he is happy, but that is a question you need to ask him.&quot; Tottenham had hoped talks on Monday between the player&apos;s agent, Emil Dantchev, and Comolli might quell rumours of unrest but Berbatov&apos;s father has since claimed his son &quot;doesn&apos;t feel happy any more and wants to leave&quot; and his brother Asen was quoted in the Sun last night as saying: &quot;I think he will stay in England. He likes the style of football. He has outgrown Spurs. He needs to find a bigger club.&quot; For the time being, however, he remains at Tottenham. &quot;He is a Spurs player and he needs to help and support the team,&quot; added Ramos. Tonight would be a good time to start.  Having suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Getafe a fortnight ago - when Martin Jol finally learned that his reign at White Hart Lane had come to an end - Spurs can ill afford another slip-up in Israel. Ramos is expected to select his strongest line-up as the former Sevilla manager renews acquaintances with the competition that has done much to shape his standing in the game. The Spaniard won the Uefa Cup in his first season at Sevilla, beating Middlesbrough in the final, and repeated the success last term. He might have to do the same with Spurs this season to ensure that European football stays on the White Hart Lane radar. He insisted that qualification through the league &quot;is still an option&quot; but there will have to be a considerable improvement if that is to be realised, given that Spurs sit one place above the relegation zone. There is a sense, though, that Ramos is beginning to make his mark on the club; he is understood to have told the midfielder Tom Huddlestone that he needs to lose weight if he is to regain his place in the side. The Spaniard was careful not to claim Tottenham had the potential to reprise Sevilla&apos;s achievements in the Uefa Cup, claiming &quot;it&apos;s too early to say&quot;, but a squad replete with internationals ought to be more than capable of reaching the later stages. That theory will have more support should Spurs win tonight.  The Israeli side have an impressive record in European competition, where they are unbeaten at home in six matches, but their position at the foot of Ligat ha&apos;Al and a record of five consecutive defeats ought to embolden Spurs.

For Steve McClaren, the sight of the Israel captain returning to form provided rare but rich encouragement for the England manager ahead of the contest in Tel Aviv next Saturday that may well decide his fate. In a season of Champions League torment, injuries and stuttering form at Liverpool the frustrations of the \u00a36m summer signing from West Ham have often been ignored. Occasional flashes of ingenuity and a superb match-winning goal at Wigan have indicated his worth to Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s squad, but a meagre seven starts and an admission that he has struggled to accept his manager&apos;s selection methods is a more telling reflection of Benayoun&apos;s Liverpool career thus far. Until Tuesday night&apos;s rout of the hapless Turks, that is. A hat-trick and two assists in the record Champions League victory arrived at a perfect moment in Liverpool&apos;s European campaign. Benayoun&apos;s English team-mates, whose European Championship qualification prospects rest on a positive Israeli result against Russia next weekend, were keen to offer more than their congratulations in the Anfield dressing room afterwards. &quot;Both me and Stevie [Gerrard] have been on at him constantly and we told him to stay fresh and do the same again in the Israel game,&quot; said Peter Crouch, one of Liverpool&apos;s four goalscorers against a Besiktas team whose misery on Merseyside did not end at Anfield. They did not fly out of John Lennon Airport until yesterday morning, just in time to be confronted by laughing ex-pat Liverpudlians making their own way home and disappointed Evertonians en route to Nuremberg. Sheepish would best describe their departure. Crouch added: &quot;I was delighted for Yossi. It was fantastic to see him getting the hat-trick and he was involved in almost everything. We need him to play that well for Israel, too, and do a job against Russia. It would be great to see him make a hero of himself to the England fans as well as those at Liverpool.&quot; Where Liverpool differ from England is that progress is in their own hands, with qualification to the knockout stages of the Champions League almost certainly theirs should they defeat the Group A leaders Porto and Marseille in the final two games. But amid the acclaim for Tuesday&apos;s historic result and reinvigorated display, one nagging doubt filled Anfield. How did Liverpool lose to Besiktas in the first place? &quot;I must admit that there is a little bit of frustration that we are in this position, because a couple of our performances have not been as good as they can be,&quot; said Crouch. &quot;They gave us a massive awakening at their ground but we always felt we could beat them here. Yes, it was a fantastic result, but we need to play like that more often. &quot;It seems to be the way that you only see the true Liverpool when we are up against it. We&apos;ve had our backs to the wall and produced the goods before and now we&apos;ve done it again. But although it was an emphatic win it is still only three points and we have a lot of work still to do.&quot; While Benayoun&apos;s input raised hope for the England manager, the prospect of Gerrard playing his ninth game in 28 days against Fulham on Saturday will be a concern, despite the subsequent break until the Croatia game on November 21. The workload prompted Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers&apos; Association, to claim the RSPCA would be called to investigate were Gerrard a racehorse, but the Liverpool captain has told Taylor to mind his own business. &quot;It is not up to anyone else but the manager, the Liverpool coaching staff and myself to decide if I am playing too much,&quot; responded Gerrard. &quot;I have just played eight games in 24 days and I suppose that is a heavy workload, but I am not the type of player who looks for a rest. I would play every game if I could. &quot;I have worked with Rafa for over three years so he knows my physical condition better than anyone and he will know when the time is right for me to have a rest.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-08T00:10:41Z", "title": "Buoyant Benayoun urged to answer England's SOS", "sentences": ["For Steve McClaren, the sight of the Israel captain returning to form provided rare but rich encouragement for the England manager ahead of the contest in Tel Aviv next Saturday that may well decide his fate."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/08/newsstory.sport"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Tottenham Hotspur"], "article": "Dimitar Berbatov has criticised reports he is unhappy at Tottenham and denied he is about to leave the club.

It&apos;s bottom against second-from-bottom here in Group G, with Tottenham having lost 2-1 at home to Getafe on the infamous Night of the Long Knives at White Hart Lane, and their hosts, Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv having gone down 2-0 to Anderlecht in their first outing in this group. Tottenham&apos;s new manager Juande Ramos steered Sevilla to victory in the last two Uefa Cups, but will have his work cut out for him to get a tune out of his new rabble to make it a hat-trick. Spurs and Hapoel Tel-Aviv have never met in European competition, but Hapoel have played four games against English opposition in European club competition before, winning one, drawing one and losing two. Their best result against English opposition came in 2001-02, when they knocked Chelsea out of the Uefa Cup, in the process becoming the first Israeli side to make the third round of the competition. None of the current Hapoel squad played in that game. The teams Hapoel Tel-Aviv: Enyeama, Bakshi, Chen, Gabriel, Shish, Natcho, Mazowa, Abutbul, Dego, Badir, Fabio Junior. Subs: Ben Shaanan, Antebi, Doani, Oved, Manzor, Srur, Abedi. Tottenham: Robinson, Stalteri, Chimbonda, Dawson, Lee, Lennon, Zokora, Jenas, Malbranque, Berbatov, Keane. Subs: Cerny, Kaboul, Tainio, Boateng, Defoe, Huddlestone, Bent. Referee: Grzegorz Gilewski (Poland) 1 min: Spurs get proceedings underway, playing in pristine, virginal white. Their hosts are wearing diabolical red shirts, shorts and socks. Hapoel Tel Aviv are having a torrid time of it at the moment - they&apos;re even worse than Spurs and currently prop up the Israeli first division. Possibly because of this, Juande Ramos has decided to give them a sporting chance by playing Pascal Chimbonda alongside the woefully out-of-form Michael Dawson in Tottenham&apos;s central defence. 3 mins: Spurs are having most of the possession early doors, but aren&apos;t doing anything productive with it. They&apos;re also looking rather nervy at the back, with Chimbonda and Dawson having already combined twice to gift possession to Fabio Junior. On the second occasion, the Hapoel man sends a shot looping into the air, but Paul Robinson deals with it capably. No, really.  8 mins: Good work from Fabio Junior, who does well to hold up the ball before laying off to Natcho, who has a pop. His low drive from 20 yards whistles just wide of Paul Robinson&apos;s left upright. 9 mins: Free-kick for Hapoel, about 60 yards from the Tottenham goal. They could have scored for all I know, because the picture on my telly&apos;s just gone and I&apos;m stuck watching top DJ Colin Murray and his Scottish sidekick Pat Nevin mugging frantically in the Five broom-cupboard. 11 mins: Hapoel didn&apos;t score, but Spurs should have. Steed Malbranque runs at the Hapoel defence, releases Dimitar Berbatov down the left channel with the ball at his feet. Foregoing a perfectly good opportunity to cross for the unmarked Robbie Keane, he takes too much out of the ball and is dispossessed by Bakshi, who concedes a corner. Nothing comes of it. 14 mins: &quot;I think Berbatov will score a hat-trick and prove his loyalty,&quot; writes Harry Bronsdon. 15 mins: &quot;Colin Murray is annoying,&quot; writes Archi Campbell. 17 mins: Good link-up play between Robbie Keane and Dimitar Berbatov. Positioned just outside the Hapoel penalty area, between the two centre-backs with his own back to goal, the Irishman tees up the Bulgarian, who shanks a surface-to-air pot-shot high and hopelessly wide. 21 mins: Apologies for the delays, but while attempting to type this report, I&apos;m being simultaneously pestered for (a) bits of today&apos;s Fiver and (b) text advice from somebody who&apos;s trying to mend a broken television set. Everybody wants a piece of me this afternoon. 23 mins: This match is as mind-numbing as you&apos;d expect and could really do with a goal to liven things up. Tottenham are just about in the ascendancy, but are also looking decidedly jittery at the back. Their new manager certainly isn&apos;t happy with their performance and is looking even more morose than usual. 25 mins: GOAL! Hapoel 0-1 Tottenham Robbie Keane volleys Tottenham ahead, volleying a Dimitar Berbatov cross past Vincent Enyeama in the Hapoel goal from about 15 yards. Good strike, even if it did bounce off his right shin. 27 mins: &quot;Every game Robbie Keane starts, he scores,&quot; exclaims the Five commentator, who clearly hasn&apos;t seen too many of the Republic of Ireland&apos;s Euro 2008 qualification matches. 29 mins: &quot;In reply to Harry (14 mins). Isn&apos;t it always easy to prove your loyalty in between transfer windows?&quot; asks David B. &quot;I&apos;m really bored at work by the way. Don&apos;t even like Spurs.&quot; Me too and me neither. 30 mins: GOAL! Hapoel 0-2 Tottenham A direct, fast build-up results in another Malbranque cross from the byline. This time Dimitar Berbatov is on send a downwards header past Enyeama. 33 mins: &quot;If you&apos;re here, does that mean you&apos;re not doing the podcast again?&quot; asks Paul McElroy, along with a disturbing number of other people. As I have mastered the powers of bilocation, I would say there&apos;s a very good chance I&apos;ll be featuring on Football Weekly Extra, which should be going up on the site soon, once the lads in the editing suite have removed all the profanity and inserted jokes, informed comment and canned laughter. As you can imagine, it takes a while to make us sound coherent. 36 mins: Hapoel have an 18-year-old named Bakshi playing at right-back and he&apos;s having the mother of all shockers. When he&apos;s not getting turned inside-out or skinned by Steed Malbranque, he&apos;s over- or under-hitting passes to give the ball away. His nerves look to be completely shot already. 38 mins: At last - a glimpse of the Robbie Keane us Rep of Ireland fans are more familiar with these days. Dimitar Berbatov put his head down and sprinted for goal, leaving several defenders trailing in his wake. Shooting venomously from about 10 yards, he brought an excellent save out of Enyeama, who could only parry the ball into the path of the onrushing Keane. With two defenders standing between him and the gaping goalmouth, the Tottenham captain somehow manages to send the ball wide, before complaining at great length to the referee that he should have got a penalty for a handball he spotted, but I didn&apos;t. Going on Robbie&apos;s recent form, I&apos;m surprised he didn&apos;t blame the media for his miss. 42 mins: From a Tottenham free-kick wide on the right, Pascal Chimbonda out-jumps Shish at the back post and heads just over the bar. A few moments previously, Shish and Berbatov were booked for handbags in the Hapoel penalty area. Soon after that, Hapoel defender and James Richardson lookalike Gabriel Dos Santos was also booked for pushing and shoving Berbatov. 45 mins: &quot;I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re multi-tasking during a Spurs game!&quot; shrieks Al Masood. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine you&apos;d be doing that if Man U or Arsenal were playing!&quot; I&apos;m not multi-tasking out of choice, Ali. Normally it&apos;s all I can do to uni-task successfully. Half-time Paul Jaines has a good idea: &quot;This competition is a waste of time, space and effort,&quot; he writes. &quot;You can&apos;t turn shit into strawberries and the fans know this - that is why most clubs hardly get a half full stadium for these games. Every club bangs on about getting into Europe but the grim reality is that the fans don&apos;t really care that much. Lets just put this competition out of its misery.&quot; Or give the winners a place in the Champions League, where stadiums are always packed to capaci ... oh. A critic critiqued: &quot;The current edition of When Saturday Comes describes Guardian Unlimited&apos;s minute-by-minute coverage as &quot;clever dick&quot; commentary,&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;That&apos;s not right at all. The minute-by-minute commentary is smart arse commentary.&quot; I saw that review, Naylor. It was the most begrudging, mealy-mouthed positive review of anything I&apos;ve ever read. I think the worst thing they could find to say was that somebody at Guardian Unlimited once referred to Ukraine as &quot;the Ukraine&quot;.  46 mins: Five are covering three matches tonight and giving away \u00a35,000 to one lucky viewer, we&apos;re covering one match and giving away nish all. But where would you rather be - in the office reading my pristine prose, or sat at home in front of the television with a can of ale in your hand, monitoring Colin Murray&apos;s costume changes? Yeah, me too. 48 mins: The second half has started, by the way. 49 mins: But it&apos;s over for Hapoel defender Shish, who&apos;s just been sent off for a second bookable defence. Already on a yellow card, he went through the back of Aaron Lennon with a tackle that was as unnecessary as it was clumsy. Off he trots and he can have no complaints. Assuming his manager skewers him for his stupidity afterwards, he&apos;ll be a Shish kebab. 52 mins: &quot;Are you a Gooner by any chance - 35 in his last 30 or something like that,&quot; writes Tom Barnett. I have not got the foggiest idea what you&apos;re talking about, Tom, but I can assure you that I am no Gooner. 53 mins: Tottenham corner. The ball is swung in to the near post, where Michael Dawson is busy pushing his marker in the back and conceding a free to get a decent flick on the ball. 55 mins: Tottenham Hotspur substitution: Steed Malbranque, who&apos;s been excellent, off. Jermain Defoe on. Aaron Lennon moves to the left wing, Berbatov moves to the right, while Defoe joins Robbie Keane up front. 59 mins: Hapoel spurn a half-chance when Fabio Junior latches on to a high ball pumped in to the Tottenham box and shoots from a narrow angle. His effort is well wide. 61 mins: &quot;Our office has started to smell like sewage,&quot; writes Colin Greer. &quot;We can&apos;t open the windows. What do we do?&quot; Well, you could try leaving through the door, Colin. Alternatively, you could stop working in Canary Wharf and get a job somewhere more fragrant. 63 mins: It&apos;s all Tottenham here at the moment. They&apos;re enjoying the vast majority of the possession, but doing sod all with it. In the meantime, I&apos;m losing the will to live as the game has died a death since Mr Shish was ordered down the tunnel. 65 mins: Just outside the Hapoel penalty area, Jermaine Jenas releases Keane with a good defence-splitting pass. Having beaten the Hapoel offside trap, the Irishman shanks the ball across the face of goal and harmlessly wide. A truly dismal effort. 67 mins: Tottenham substitution: Jermaine Jenas and Robbie Keane off, Kevin Prince Boateng and Darren Bent on. 69 mins: &quot;Are Spurs fans are calling themselves &apos;yid army&apos; tonight and if so, how do the Tel Avivians feel about that?&quot; asks Luke Kelly. 71 mins: A neat pass from Boateng enables Aaron Lennon to cross from the left, but Vincent Enyeama gets down well to prevent Darren Bent from pounc ... ah, dis anyone even reading this anymore? Let&apos;s face it, we&apos;re all bored here. The Spurs players are bored, the Hapoel players are bored, the spectators are bored, the people watching on Five are bored, I&apos;m bored, you&apos;re bored ... 76 mins: &quot;I&apos;m watching at home on the sick and was looking forward to an unexpected treat in an afternoon game,&quot; writes Iain, whose surname I won&apos;t divulge in case I get him into trouble. &quot;They&apos;re playing like 30 years ago in international football. Why isn&apos;t anyone running? Maybe I&apos;m just going off football.&quot; Iain&apos;s not wrong when he talks about how pedestrian and old-fashioned this is. The only thing missing is the commentary coming down the phoneline.  77 mins: Two wake-up calls in quick succession for Tottenham, whose defence is fast asleep. Put clean through on goal after Dawson was beaten in the air, Fabio Junior should have scored for Hapoel, but was foiled by a good save from Paul Robinson, who rushed off his line and prevented the striker from lifting the ball over him and scoring. Earlier, Stalteri was forced to the come to the rescue of his defence, who seemed happy enough to let Dos Santos walk the ball into the net from the halfway line, until the Canadian rolled up his sleeves and got stuck in. 81 mins: The only thing preventing Tottenham from routing this rabble would appear to be bone idleness. They just can&apos;t be bothered putting in the necessary legwork that would see them rip 10-man Hapoel asunder. For their part, the hosts are doing what Rangers did in Camp Nou against Barcelona last night - playing with a view to not getting hammered by too much. Seeing as they&apos;re only playing Wigan on Sunday, if I was Juande Ramos, I&apos;d call treble-training tomorrow and run these players around the pitch until every single one of them had deposited the contents of his stomach on the ground and was begging for mercy. Then I&apos;d start the session. 87 mins: Corner for Hapoel. Dos Santos heads, Robinson&apos;s claims. The Spurs goalkeeper sets up a quick counter-attack, Defoe plays Darren Bent through and he takes it around the goalkeeper. Having tipped it too far to one side, by the time he gets around to poking it goalwards, there&apos;s a defender on hand to deflect what should have been an easy chance on to the post. 92 mins: Peep! Peep! Peep! The referee puts us all out of our misery. Thank God - that was dull. Thanks for your time and your emails - although if you&apos;re still reading this, you should probably think about getting psychiatric help. Next up for Spurs it&apos;s Danish side Aalborg BK on November 29. It&apos;s the anticipation of mouthwatering fixtures like that remind us why we fell in love with football in the first place.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-08T18:25:53Z", "title": "Football: Hapoel Tel-Aviv v Tottenham - live!", "sentences": ["Hapoel Tel Aviv are having a torrid time of it at the moment - they&apos;re even worse than Spurs and currently prop up the Israeli first division.", "69 mins: &quot;Are Spurs fans are calling themselves &apos;yid army&apos; tonight and if so, how do the Tel Avivians feel about that?&quot; asks Luke Kelly."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/08/minutebyminute.tottenhamhotspur"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "It is rare for an England manager to name his squad while wondering if there is any purpose to the exercise. Steve McClaren will not own up to such misgivings but the party he announces today can no longer know what meaning their endeavours will have. Should David Beckham be included, the former captain will be conscious that appearances in the friendly with Austria in Vienna next Friday and the Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia at Wembley the following Wednesday might see him stranded on 99 caps. If results go wrong, sentiment alone would allow him another game. The emphasis then would be on a future without the 32-year-old, who did get nearer to fitness after his knee injury with a 70-minute outing for LA Galaxy against Vancouver on Wednesday. Beckham&apos;s concerns, none the less, are trivial by comparison with the pressing subjects. The main advantage of the friendly must lie in keeping the players&apos; minds off a destiny beyond their control. If Russia beat Israel and Andorra, with Croatia taking a point in Macedonia, England will be absent from Euro 2008. That outcome, despite world-weary talk of match-fixing, is not inevitable and visitors to Tel Aviv have seldom won in recent years. McClaren and his men will be reminding themselves of that. Any idea of extensive experimentation in Vienna must have been abandoned because England will need to be fully prepared if that fixture with Croatia does offer a chance to rescue themselves. But a degree of alteration is inevitable. Rio Ferdinand is suspended for the game against Croatia. His customary partner in central defence, John Terry, was ruled out of the fateful game in Moscow and is yet to make his comeback from knee surgery. Ashley Cole, likewise at Chelsea, has not made an appearance since October 13. At least another Stamford Bridge left-back, Wayne Bridge, can be named by McClaren. The manager&apos;s midfield options ought to be widened, too, by the availability of Owen Hargreaves and Michael Carrick, who missed the match with Russia. That area of the side, indeed, should allow McClaren some agreeable deliberations. Frank Lampard was dropped from the starting line-up by McClaren and England did seem to achieve greater balance in midfield by pairing Steven Gerrard with Gareth Barry. McClaren may need to review that issue since Lampard has rediscovered his best form at club level, scoring four times in his last three appearances for Chelsea. Reflection of another sort will occupy the manager elsewhere in the team. He has been determined to stand by Paul Robinson but it was the goalkeeper&apos;s mistake that led to Russia&apos;s winner. McClaren, however, has not identified a wholly convincing rival for the position. The veteran David James has been vilified in the past and Scott Carson is yet to be capped. Will the manager see these fixtures as the right time to start conducting experiments? There may, of course, be few decisions left for McClaren to take. England, since failing to get to the 1994 World Cup, have come to take it for granted that they will feature at all major finals. Missing out at Euro 2008 would constitute a wretched campaign for the manager who succeeded that qualification expert, Sven-Goran Eriksson. McClaren should have some hope of success in the next two games, especially since Austria, who stage Euro 2008 jointly with Switzerland, are tipped to be the worst hosts ever of a major tournament. None the less McClaren&apos;s prospects really depend on the level of performance Israel give against Russia.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-09T00:10:15Z", "title": "Kevin McCarra: McClaren picks his tools for a job that may not matter", "sentences": ["That outcome, despite world-weary talk of match-fixing, is not inevitable and visitors to Tel Aviv have seldom won in recent years."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/09/sport.comment2"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "&quot;There&apos;s something in the air&quot;, shrugged the caf\u00e9 owner when asked why the plaza was deserted at noon on Friday. What should have been his busiest spell of the week - Friday lunchtime, when pre-Shabbat shoppers usually swarm round the city centre - turned out to be as dead as any other day of the week. The reason was, as he said, down to what was in the air, or, looked at another way, what could be arcing its way through the air en route from Gaza at any moment. This was Sderot, and this was the other side of collective punishment - an entire town held hostage by the actions of a bloodthirsty enemy across the border. At the behest of a reader who took issue with my recent piece about Gaza, I took him up on his offer to drive me down to Sderot to witness the harsh reality of life under near-daily rocket attack. What I found there could have been straight out of Studs Terkel&apos;s chronicle of Depression-era America - a town utterly devoid of hope, a people feeling completely abandoned by their government, and an air of resignation that things aren&apos;t going to get better any time soon. Kassams or no Kassams, Sderot has never been a prosperous place to live. Isolated from the more salubrious parts of Israel, its mainly-immigrant population consists of decidedly blue-collar types. Consequently, the seven year long barrage of rockets has dragged Sderot&apos;s already precarious economic situation into the realms of disaster. Factories have closed, businesses have relocated out of range of the onslaught, and no company in its right mind would think of investing in such an imperilled area. While the casualty figures have, fortunately, remained relatively low (thanks to the crude nature of the missiles being fired), the town is effectively under constant siege, with no one knowing when, where or why the next barrage will be launched. Pockmarked pavements and shattered buildings bear the scars of war, and the dozens of ugly concrete bomb shelters on every street are a constant reminder of the Sword of Damocles that hovers above the town. One heavily-pierced teenaged boy I spoke to painted a bleak picture of the future for him and his friends. &quot;There&apos;s nothing for us here,&quot; he said as he languidly smoked a cheap cigarette. &quot;We all want to leave after we&apos;ve finished the army. Where would I go? Anywhere - it doesn&apos;t matter. Just as long as I don&apos;t have to live here.&quot; Two of his friends appeared, and - after they&apos;d all kissed one another&apos;s cheeks in typically flamboyant Sephardi fashion - they concurred with their mate&apos;s opinion. &quot;Anyone with money gets out of here,&quot; said one boy. &quot;There&apos;s no work here, especially now the Kassams are raining down.&quot; The day before nine rockets had been fired at the town, but the boys were reluctant to think about the political climate that was breeding such hate from the Palestinian side. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why they do it,&quot; said the most vocal of the trio. &quot;And I don&apos;t care either - I&apos;ve got enough problems of my own here [to worry about what they&apos;re thinking in Gaza].&quot; He said his nephews had begun to stutter, and that other kids started wetting their beds, all as a result of the constant state of fear that grips the town. The boys&apos; gallows humour came out as they told of a major gaffe on the part of phone company Cellcom. Earlier in the week, Cellcom - who have donated a lot of money for youth activities in Sderot - decided to put on an impromptu firework display for the residents, without telling a soul of their intentions. The result was all too predictable. &quot;Everyone went mad, thinking the Kassams were coming,&quot; laughed one boy. &quot;People called the police, ran to the shelters - you can imagine the scene.&quot; While many companies and individuals have been quick off the blocks to donate money to the embattled town, the residents complain bitterly of apathy on the part of the government. Racism, elitism and plain indifference to an &quot;unimportant&quot; town were among the various accusations levelled at the authorities, with people scornfully asking if anyone would have let bombs fall on Tel Aviv for seven years running. &quot;Our blood is different,&quot; according to bitter graffiti sprayed on one shelter in the heart of town. &quot;We are not second class,&quot; it continued, reflecting the deep resentment many feel for those meant to protect them from the terrorists. At the emergency room, Sderot&apos;s chief paramedic preferred to praise the town&apos;s Blitz spirit rather than dwell on the government&apos;s half-hearted response to the situation. &quot;We all know that we have to be strong in the face of the terror,&quot; he declared, &quot;and we must not hold up our hands to those trying to kill us.&quot; He reminded us that &quot;Israel is the strongest country in the region now, when once we thought the Arabs might make it all the way to Tel Aviv [in the 1973 war].&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t have any other land&quot;, he went on, &quot;so we have to fight for every inch.&quot; Although he hoped his children would grow up to join combat units of the IDF, he still said that &quot;we have to believe that peace will happen, and that we&apos;ll one day live side by side.&quot; His frontline work treating the rocket victims meant that he could &quot;go to bed every night knowing he&apos;d done a little bit more for his country&quot;. Fortunately the terrorists were having a day off while we were there, so Avi had plenty of time to talk to us about his take on the conflict. But, a day later, the bombs were back and the town was clearing up the debris once more. Collectively punishing the Palestinians is still not the answer, however frustrated the government is at being unable to halt the rockets. However, those who point the finger at the IDF for proposing, or carrying out, war crimes against the Palestinians ought to be just as vocal in their condemnation of the Kassam launchers. Too many people play the numbers game, suggesting that things aren&apos;t anywhere near as bad in Sderot as they are in Gaza because fewer people are dying violent deaths. But that view is myopic, as well as unhelpful in terms of solving the crisis. Whatever the casualty figures, there is an entire town suffering in silence, and an entire generation of children whose only experience of the Palestinians is terror and hate. They deserve as much sympathy as those trapped in the quagmire of Gaza, because they&apos;re as undeserving victims as any other civilians caught up in the conflict.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-09T10:33:00Z", "title": "The other side of collective punishment", "sentences": ["Racism, elitism and plain indifference to an &quot;unimportant&quot; town were among the various accusations levelled at the authorities, with people scornfully asking if anyone would have let bombs fall on Tel Aviv for seven years running.", "&quot;We all know that we have to be strong in the face of the terror,&quot; he declared, &quot;and we must not hold up our hands to those trying to kill us.&quot; He reminded us that &quot;Israel is the strongest country in the region now, when once we thought the Arabs might make it all the way to Tel Aviv [in the 1973 war].&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t have any other land&quot;, he went on, &quot;so we have to fight for every inch.&quot; Although he hoped his children would grow up to join combat units of the IDF, he still said that &quot;we have to believe that peace will happen, and that we&apos;ll one day live side by side.&quot; His frontline work treating the rocket victims meant that he could &quot;go to bed every night knowing he&apos;d done a little bit more for his country&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/09/theothersideofcollectivep"}, {"tags": ["Georgia", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian billionaire accused of plotting a coup, today said he was considering running for president in January&apos;s election to prevent his country sliding into &quot;dictatorship&quot;. Mr Patarkatsishvili told Reuters in written answers from Tel Aviv, Israel, that the president, Mikhail Saakashvili, had lost legitimacy and was no longer the real leader of the Georgian people.  Asked if he would run for president, Mr Patarkatsishvili said: &quot;I am seriously thinking about it. I think the opposition understand that now - as never before - unity is essential. Georgian society needs one single candidate from the opposition.&quot;  A flamboyant businessman who earned a fortune in Moscow as the Soviet Union crumbled, Mr Patarkatsishvili initially supported Mr Saakashvili when he came to power in 2003 on the back of the Rose revolution protests. Mr Patarkatsishvili later turned against the US-educated president and has been funding the opposition. He said he would continue to do so.  Earlier, Georgia&apos;s parliament voted to back Mr Saakashvili&apos;s state of emergency order following clashes between police and opposition supporters.  The 15-day emergency decree, which bans independent media and mass meetings, won easy passage because Mr Saakashvili&apos;s party and its allies have around two-thirds of the seats. &quot;The threat that existed until now is still present despite the calm that has been restored,&quot; the speaker, Nino Burdzhanadze, told parliament. &quot;I do not exclude [that] we will rescind today&apos;s decision before these 15 days expire.&quot; Mr Saakashvili, a pro-western leader who was swept to power during the 2003 Rose revolution, disappointed his supporters in the west by sending out riot police to crush a mass protest this week. Under western pressure, he yesterday announced that an early presidential election on January 5. Analysts said the move would give opponents little time to unite behind a leader. The opposition leader, Tina Khidasheli, told Reuters that she welcomed the early election, but challenged Mr Saakashvili to reopen independent media outlets in order to ensure a fair vote. &quot;We will have a common presidential candidate very soon,&quot; she said. &quot;We can eject Saakashvili from Georgia&apos;s political scene.&quot; The coalition is made up of 10 parties which united last month in an attempt to force 39-year-old Mr Saakashvili from power. The group has called off protests during the state of emergency to avoid supporters clashing with police. Opposition parties mainly supported Mr Saakashvili during mass protests in the 2003 revolution, but now accuse him of heading a corrupt and authoritarian government that has mismanaged the economy. As part of the crackdown on the opposition, the prosecutor general said billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili, who finances opposition parties, was suspected of plotting a coup and was wanted for questioning. &quot;The prosecutor&apos;s office will take actions to bring Patarkatsishvili to the investigation body and to question him as a suspect,&quot; a statement said. Earlier, Mr Patarkatsishvili, who co-owns the Imedi radio and television channels with Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corporation, condemned Mr Saakashvili&apos;s decision to impose a state of emergency. He described the action as undemocratic, saying it was designed to gag the opposition ahead of presidential elections. The unrest in Georgia has inflamed tensions with Russia, with the relationship between the two countries being difficult at the best of times.

The Spurs head coach is keen to implement the attacking philosophy that brought him such success at Sevilla but he claimed those plans will have to remain on hold ahead of tomorrow&apos;s Premier League match against Wigan at White Hart Lane. &quot;We are still a long way away from achieving what we want to do, as much in defence as in attack,&quot; he said. &quot;The team is very low on confidence and the team needs security. We need a few really good results to relax the team and to make them start believing in themselves again. &quot;It is all to do with bad results the team has had. That takes away the security and the confidence of the players. But if we can put a few results together, let&apos;s see if we can get that self-belief back.&quot; The Spaniard does not appear to be suffering with the same problem. Paul Robinson, the Spurs goalkeeper, revealed after the 2-0 victory over Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Uefa Cup on Thursday night that &quot;the manager is a very confident person. The players respect him and are playing for him straight away.&quot; That might be so but Ramos is demanding far more from a squad that has benefited from major investment after finishing fifth for a second successive season. He insisted he has not given up on repeating that feat and qualifying for Europe through the league. &quot;At the moment we&apos;re a little far away from that,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the next game is going to be crucial in terms of joining the teams in the middle of the table and from there, in the second half of the season, we will try to get in the European places. It is so important for us to get a victory against Wigan because if we don&apos;t we miss out on the chance of making it to mid-table.&quot; Gary Megson was hardly a universally popular choice when he became manager of Bolton a fortnight ago but he has quickly won the dressing room over. Indeed Kevin Davies believes that Sammy Lee&apos;s successor shares much in common with Sam Allardyce. &quot;Everybody could see confidence was low when the new manager came in,&quot; explained Bolton&apos;s centre-forward, who scored a late equaliser as Megson&apos;s men claimed a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich in Thursday&apos;s Uefa Cup group stage game. &quot;But Gary Megson is good at man-managing players and he&apos;s good around the dressing room. He&apos;s just what we needed. He&apos;s got the same attributes as Big Sam.&quot; Allardyce steered Bolton into Europe before leaving for Newcastle last spring but Lee&apos;s brief stewardship has left the club in trouble and desperate to beat fellow strugglers Middlesbrough at the Reebok tomorrow. &quot;Nobody can put their finger on what went wrong under Sammy,&quot; admitted Davies. &quot;But Gary Megson has come in and stressed we need to be difficult to beat. We&apos;ve gone back to 4-5-1 - [from Lee&apos;s 4-4-2] getting men behind the ball when we&apos;re defending and going to 4-3-3 when we&apos;re attacking and it&apos;s working. I&apos;d gone nine or ten games without scoring and it was wearing me down but the new manager&apos;s given me confidence.

Nothing could discourage him, not even the news that he will be without Wayne Rooney for next Friday&apos;s friendly in Vienna and the potentially crucial qualifier against Croatia at Wembley the following Wednesday. The Manchester United attacker injured ankle ligaments yesterday and left the Carrington training ground on crutches. He is expected to be out for a month. It is a serious blow, but McClaren had been taking a long-term view before the news broke. He argued that he should remain as manager even if England do not reach Euro 2008 and even predicted that results are about to turn in his team&apos;s favour. Since conviction alone cannot suffice there was manoeuvring as well. McClaren shrewdly referred to the backing he had received from Noel White and Sir Dave Richards, chairman and vice-chairman of the international committee, as well as Geoff Thompson and Brian Barwick, chairman and chief executive of the FA itself. The manager said they had each encouraged him after the match with Andorra in March, when England were booed by their own fans. In effect, they are being challenged to stay true to their word. There was a barely suppressed emotion to McClaren, whose side may be out next Saturday if Croatia and Russia get the results they want. England are not in action then. &quot;I hope to God we&apos;re in it and need a result,&quot; McClaren said of the consequences of his rivals&apos; matches. &quot;Then the Croatia game will take care of itself.&quot; Croatia will advance if they take so much as a point in Macedonia, so England&apos;s hopes lie mostly with Russia&apos;s trip to Tel Aviv. Guus Hiddink&apos;s team need to win there, prior to an inevitable victory over Andorra, to take their berth at Euro 2008. Otherwise, England can overtake them by beating Croatia. The England scout David Geddes will be in Skopje, but McClaren will not attend either fixture. He talked wistfully of Brian Clough&apos;s Derby County learning, while on holiday, that they had become League champions in 1972 courtesy of their rivals&apos; results. &quot;Going away to Israel is very, very tough - we proved that,&quot; said McClaren, wryly, of his side&apos;s goalless draw. &quot;They are a proud nation. They have a great home record. The whole of Europe will be looking at that game. Israel will know that. They will know they have to perform.&quot; McClaren also claimed that England are progressing and can control their own fate in future. To that end, the manager implied that the squad was still burdened with the disappointments of the World Cup in the early stages of the European Championship qualifiers. McClaren feels that particular harm was done by the goalless draw with Macedonia at Old Trafford in October 2006. &quot;It was difficult coming into the job and building the confidence back up. We took some hits,&quot; he said. The aim is to suggest an extreme contrast with current circumstances. &quot;We are playing with attitude,&quot; McClaren said of the current situation. &quot;We are playing good football, we have competition for places. I love this job, I love working with this team. And this team will go on in the future and be successful.&quot; He can highlight results such as the 3-0 win over Russia at Wembley. It is as valid, though, for sceptics to refer to other games. England took one point from fixtures in Croatia, Israel and Russia. Nor are these all events from the distant past. McClaren&apos;s men were beaten 2-1 in Moscow last month. &quot;Things out of our control changed,&quot; he said, thinking of a 1-0 lead that was lost when the referee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, awarded a penalty for a tug by Rooney that started outside the area but continued inside the box. McClaren, though, would hardly have been inclined to castigate a productive forward who had opened the scoring. When Rooney turned his ankle yesterday, the Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, was relieved that the damage proved less severe than it looked. &quot;We have to deal with it,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;It is an opportunity for someone else to come in and do a job.&quot; That man is likely to be Peter Crouch. The captain, John Terry, was ruled out of the Austria and Croatia matches following knee surgery and another centre-half, Rio Ferdinand, is out because he is suspended for the Euro 2008 qualifier. David Beckham, though, does return. &quot;We need as many big-game players as possible,&quot; said the manager. Should England fail, the FA are expected to make a quick decision about McClaren&apos;s future before the draw for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in Durban on November 25. There is no appetite for another recruitment process. However, public opinion will be taken into account and the FA would need to be convinced that McClaren can get England to the next World Cup. The manager genuinely supposes Euro 2008 is within reach. He claims always to have believed that the outcome would depend on Croatia&apos;s visit to Wembley. His own prospects may also hinge on that vision of heart-stopping success at the very last moment.

We&apos;re in north London&apos;s Golders Green, outside Sir Ronald Cohen&apos;s childhood house. Whoever lives here now must be doing all right, I say. Look at the size of that Mercedes. It sits in the driveway, shiny as a button on a sailor&apos;s jacket. The multimillionaire businessman gives it the once-over. &quot;Ah, but it&apos;s old,&quot; he says. He turns to his chauffeur: &quot;Adam, can you tell us the age of that car?&quot; Soon enough both the Merc and me are put in our place. That tells us two things about the super-rich. First, they can afford far higher standards than the rest of us. Second, they can outsource any argument to their servants. But it&apos;s the aspiration thing that brings us here today. Sir Ronald is on a mission to make Britain a more enterprising society, and this tour of his suburban hinterland suggests that even someone who came here as a refugee can end up a powerful financier - and have a relationship with the prime minister that makes others either jealous or suspicious. His Jewish family were kicked out of Nasser&apos;s Egypt in a wave of anti-Jewish persecution when he was 11. &quot;On the plane out, my father had tears in his eyes; he had lost everything.&quot; They wound up here in middle-class Golders Green, in a three-bed semi. It is well-kept and pretty, the sort of thing that lots of people pray to the property gods to provide. Others may hanker after such a life, but for Sir Ronald it is nostalgia. He was out of there by 18, and now has homes in Notting Hill, Manhattan and Tel Aviv. There&apos;s nothing shabby about Golders Green; it&apos;s just that it no longer suits Sir Ronald. He is every inch the alpha-businessman, with his lemonade hair, perfect blue suit, shiny shoes and eyes dancing in constant appraisal. But the edge is softened by an elaborate courteousness that is almost balletic: doors are held open with something close to heel-clicking; thank-yous are swiftly returned with my-pleasures. At one point, he denies being part of the establishment and reminisces about when Notting Hill was a kind of stucco-fronted bohemia. It sounds odd coming from someone with a knighthood and a fortune estimated at \u00a3260m. But he has been treated with huge suspicion, especially over his links with Gordon Brown. In the countdown to Brown taking over as prime minister, it was widely speculated that Sir Ronald would become his fundraiser. He would be &quot;Brown&apos;s Lord Levy&quot;; a reference to Tony Blair&apos;s chief bagman, who just happened also to be Jewish. Since Levy had been arrested in the cash-for-honours investigation, the implication was obvious: a scandal was brewing. His view on the rough treatment from parts of the press? &quot;There has been some innuendo - references to secrecy and working behind the scenes - part of the stereotype that goes with antisemitism. There have been occasional comments that seem to be drawing attention to my Jewish identity, rather than the policies I espouse.&quot; Next stop his old school, where he enrolled speaking barely any English. The modern-day incarnation, Mill Hill county high school, looks comfortingly normal, even down to the kids in the canteen chewing pizza by a sign reading Eat More Healthily. We settle in a classroom and talk about his new book - part of the enterprise drive, it is about how to be a successful entrepreneur, with lessons drawn from his decades running the private-equity investment group Apax. Thousands of businesses have pitched their ideas to his firm, in a process that sounds like the TV programme Dragons&apos; Den, but on less snazzy premises. Successful candidates included bookseller Tim Waterstone (&quot;very charismatic&quot;) and Chris Evans, when he needed funds to buy Virgin Radio (&quot;he didn&apos;t look it, but he was a very sensible bloke&quot;). There are lots of good stories, and the occasional slogan that reads like motivational verse for the suicidal sales rep: &quot;Stop worrying about failure and put that energy into winning the race&quot;. A big obstacle to a more entrepreneurial Britain, he thinks, is the government&apos;s proposed changes to the tax system, especially the rise in tax on capital gains. It may claw back money from the &quot;big boys&quot; of private equity, but he thinks it will hurt vulnerable start-ups far more. Short of cash, new firms often offer their workers shares - except the tax on cashing those in is about to go up by 80%. &quot;Entrepreneurs need to recruit executives who know how to run a business. They&apos;re on big salaries with big companies that offer pensions. A 10% rate enables someone with a big income to take a chance and work with an entrepreneur.&quot; Coming from one of Labour&apos;s biggest champions in finance, this is that fabled thing, a stinging attack. Another big change in last month&apos;s pre-budget report was the tax on non-doms, those who live here but pay the majority of their tax to another country. Does he support that? &quot;Sure, tax is not a Procrustean bed&quot; (a reference to the Greek bandit Procrustes who would amputate the head or feet of people if they did not fit his bed, implying a fixed, unchangeable level). But squeeze the non-doms too hard and they will leave. &quot;You&apos;ve got Frankfurt and Paris and Geneva trying to attract the people working in London. These sorts of skills fly in and out of the UK on an aeroplane.&quot; For all his influence on our government, Sir Ronald is often accused of himself being a non-dom. Will he deny that? I get the usual reply: his tax affairs are confidential. A lot of people don&apos;t like Sir Ronald simply because he is one of the super-rich. Even Tatler magazine has had a pop at his ilk. This is &quot;the aristocrats, or old money&quot;, he says, who are annoyed at being overtaken in the rich lists. Yet he has warned before that the gap between super-rich and super-poor could lead to riots. Should something be done? &quot;The markets don&apos;t deal with their social consequences, they deal with business consequences. Those who become extremely wealthy should feel an obligation to put something back.&quot; That obligation comes naturally to some, he says, but for others, it&apos;s enlightened self-interest: &quot;They realise that for an entrepreneurial system to work, you&apos;ve got to avoid government having to step in and say, look, we will redistribute, we will tax.&quot; So what does he want government to do? &quot;The essential thing of helping those who are at the bottom of the ladder to climb up.&quot; No more. This is well thought out, and sincere; Sir Ronald has been doing heavy-duty charity work for years. But it&apos;s hardly progressive. Yet this is a man who has Brown&apos;s ear and has donated \u00a31.8m to the Labour party since 2001. But that allegiance may not be as rock-solid as is normally assumed. When asked what has gone wrong for the new prime minister, he replies with an honesty refreshing from one of Brown&apos;s insiders: &quot;All of a sudden what looked like a one-horse race is now a two-horse race.&quot; How does he feel about David Cameron becoming the next PM? &quot;I am a businessman who supports a political party for two reasons: whether it supports entrepreneurship and social investment. If you said to me today, am I concerned about the possibility that a Conservative government would come back in and overturn the entrepreneurial system that we&apos;ve worked so hard to do or seriously break the growth of social investment, I&apos;d say no.&quot; One of the school&apos;s teaching staff comes in, hoping the godfather of private equity will say a few words to the business studies class. Polite as ever, he goes in. He starts with a question: Have they heard of &quot;private equity&quot; or &quot;venture capital&quot;? A girl nods her head, but she&apos;s the only one, and, as if to confirm her swot status, she&apos;s sitting at the front. What about entrepreneurship? A pause, before one boy timidly ventures: &quot;We ran a Christmas stall about two years ago.&quot; OK, how many of these teenagers want to run their own business? Two of the students look slightly scared, but the other six shoot up their hands. &quot;Splendid,&quot; beams Sir Ronald and the light comes streaming through the windows. \u00b7 The Second Bounce of the Ball: Turning Risk into Opportunity, by Ronald Cohen, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson at \u00a320", "publicationDate": "2007-11-10T23:55:24Z", "title": "Enter the dragon", "sentences": ["He was out of there by 18, and now has homes in Notting Hill, Manhattan and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/10/uk.conservatives2"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steve McClaren"], "article": "Fate continued to kick Steve McClaren in the goolies even after he had named what will probably be his last England squad. Not everyone will have sympathy for the England manager but the gods appear to have taken against him. When the bad news filtered through about Wayne Rooney on Friday, after McClaren had named his squad for the meaningless friendly in Austria on Friday night and the final Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia at Wembley the following Wednesday, it was the second time this season he has had to deal with such disappointment. Two months ago, the training-ground injury victim was Frank Lampard. Rooney&apos;s absence against Croatia would not matter much should Russia gain the win they anticipate in Tel Aviv on Saturday, but the striker will be sorely missed of the Crotia game is still &apos;live&apos;. Other players McClaren is having to do without include John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville, Emile Heskey and probably Ashley Cole, while at various times in the past 18 months he has been deprived of Rooney, Lampard, Michael Owen, Owen Hargreaves and David Beckham. The last is in the squad for Austria and Croatia because McClaren values his experience and ability to influence big games. McClaren still believes in the ability of big-name players to win big games, despite the failure of his biggest favourite, Steven Gerrard, to accept the chance that would surely have seen off Russia in Moscow. &apos;Beckham is only in the squad; he knows he&apos;s not guaranteed a place in the starting line-up,&apos; McClaren kept insisting. &apos;He knows he needs to be fitter, he&apos;s under no illusions. I don&apos;t think the England team is set in stone any more, either. People like Gareth Barry, Micah Richards and Emile Heskey have forced their way in and done very well. That has pleased me and I dismiss the idea that we don&apos;t have enough quality players or the back-up isn&apos;t good enough. But I just think David Beckham is different, in the fact that these games are big games and he&apos;s a big-game player. When you are coming to play Croatia, needing a result, there&apos;s nothing better than having David Beckham available for you, who has proved that he&apos;s done it before and can do it again.&apos; Some of this might not make much sense, but it would be cruel to be overly critical at this stage. McClaren can be excused for not knowing whether he is going forwards or backwards. He knows he is facing a Russian firing squad, and Beckham might usefully be considered the blindfold. He might yet get the luck in Tel Aviv that has eluded him so far, but should England be out by the time they face Croatia on Wednesday week he will need his Andorra earplugs at Wembley. He would love to stay on, but a coach who said at the outset he would be happy to be judged by results may ultimately be judged by the public. Is he happy about that? &apos;Hopefully public opinion won&apos;t come into it,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;But I accept it is now out of my control.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-11T00:14:02Z", "title": "Paul Wilson: Is McClaren's luck running out?", "sentences": ["Rooney&apos;s absence against Croatia would not matter much should Russia gain the win they anticipate in Tel Aviv on Saturday, but the striker will be sorely missed of the Crotia game is still &apos;live&apos;.", "He might yet get the luck in Tel Aviv that has eluded him so far, but should England be out by the time they face Croatia on Wednesday week he will need his Andorra earplugs at Wembley."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/11/sport.comment"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Yossi Benayoun spoke of his devastation last night after learning that he will miss Israel&apos;s European Championship qualifier at home to Russia on Saturday. The feeling was no doubt shared by Steve McClaren, who will become the first England manager not to lead his side to a major tournament since Graham Taylor and the 1994 World Cup should the Israelis lose to Guus Hiddink&apos;s team. England require an Israel win or draw against the Russians to regain control of their own destiny in Group E before their final qualifier against Croatia at Wembley a week on Wednesday but are now reliant on a team without its captain after Benayoun tore an adductor muscle in Liverpool&apos;s 2-0 win over Fulham on Saturday. The 27-year-old will be out for three weeks with the problem, missing Liverpool&apos;s trip to Newcastle on November 24 and a must-win Champions League fixture at home to Porto four days later. Unlike Liverpool, however, Israel are not blessed with options to compensate for the loss of the in-form midfielder and the repercussions for England are potentially enormous. &quot;I have a slight tear of the groin,&quot; said Benayoun, who scored a hat-trick in Liverpool&apos;s rout of Besiktas last week and had been urged by Steven Gerrard and Peter Crouch to carry that form on to the international stage. &quot;I just felt it tear 10 minutes from the end of the game. I am devastated to miss the game because I was desperate to do well. I am fully aware of what the game means to everyone in England but it is not up to me.&quot; Benayoun cancelled his scheduled flight to Tel Aviv yesterday to undergo a scan on his groin, in the hope of receiving permission to join his international colleagues today. Those hopes were thwarted when Liverpool&apos;s doctors decided he must remain on Merseyside and rest for the next three weeks. &quot;A scan has confirmed Benayoun sustained a tear against Fulham,&quot; confirmed the Liverpool spokesman, Ian Cotton, last night. Liverpool&apos;s manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, said there was no prospect of Benayoun making a rapid recovery to return against Russia. &quot;He tried to make three runs at the end of the game and couldn&apos;t go,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;He was clearly injured and he cannot play for Israel next week. With the adductor muscle you can keep the ball and you can run straight but you cannot turn. In the last five minutes against Fulham he was limping and the doctor has said his injury is very clear.&quot; McClaren&apos;s problems worsened on Friday when the Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney injured his ankle playing head tennis in training. He, along with England&apos;s captain John Terry, will miss the friendly against Austria on Friday and the Croatia match.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-12T00:00:46Z", "title": "McClaren's fears confirmed by Benayoun blow", "sentences": ["I am fully aware of what the game means to everyone in England but it is not up to me.&quot; Benayoun cancelled his scheduled flight to Tel Aviv yesterday to undergo a scan on his groin, in the hope of receiving permission to join his international colleagues today."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/12/newsstory.sport3"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Wigan Athletic"], "article": "If Tottenham Hotspur played like this every week there would never be a doubt about Dimitar Berbatov&apos;s future. The problem, though, is getting Berbatov himself consistently to play like this. When he does, Spurs purr, but there is a persistent feeling that this languid forward cannot be bothered if results are not going his way. Even the manager, Juande Ramos, admitted that his \u00a310.9m striker is high maintenance. &quot;He&apos;s a player who when the team are winning he&apos;ll be happy and when the team is playing well he will want to stay,&quot; said Ramos. &quot;He has said he wants to stay. At the end of the season he will make a decision and hopefully then he will want to stay. I think Dimitar played exceptionally, like the rest of the team today.&quot; His failure to score at least meant there was no opportunity to pick over the player&apos;s body language as there had been when he scored against Hapoel Tel Aviv on Thursday. Then his unsmiling celebration was interpreted as a snub to his club. Sang-froid or sulk? It seems that Berbatov is keeping even his manager guessing on that one. Of course when, as last week, members of the striker&apos;s own family are quoted saying that he is unhappy at White Hart Lane it makes the situation even harder to read. But Ramos would surely settle for more of this. Even without scoring the Bulgaria international was the fulcrum of everything good about this performance. There were pretty flicks and tricks but it was his perspicacity that mattered most. Ever aware of his team-mates&apos; movement, Berbatov prised open the defence at will. On 25 minutes he collected a ball from Jermain Jenas and played it back with a through pass that put him and Robbie Keane two against two with Kevin Kilbane and the goalkeeper, Chris Kirkland. Jenas was calm as he jinked round Kirkland and flicked in at the near post to double the lead he and the Spurs captain had already engineered. That had come on 12 minutes, when Keane beat Andreas Granqvist to the byline on the right side of the goal. As the Irishman prodded the ball across the goal, Kirkland inexcusably allowed it to squirm underneath him, giving Jenas the opportunity to walk the ball into the net from a yard. Jenas, having scored only once previously this season, should have had a third before the first half was out. In the move of the match Pascal Chimbonda found Aaron Lennon, who touched it on to Jenas. Berbatov gave himself as the wall for the pass but did so with such exquisite artistry as to take the breath away. His first-time back-heel flick found Jenas, who glided inside Kilbane and outside Titus Bramble. His shot, with the outside of his right foot, struck the outside of the post when it seemed easier to score, denying Jenas the opportunity to celebrate the birth of his daughter this week with a hat-trick. But by then Spurs were already three goals to the good, again courtesy of Berbatov&apos;s assistance. He picked up a high ball on the corner of the 18-yard box, cushioning it back for Lennon. The winger sent a ferocious, sweeping half-volley past Kirkland. Wigan could not get the ball out of their own half by now. For all his effort, Marcus Bent cut a lonesome figure up front and was isolated as his team-mates in midfield failed to provide the necessary support. At one point, as he dropped into his own half to pick up the ball, all 11 Wigan players were within 35 yards of their own goal. Antoine Sibierski was brought on for David Cotterill as the visitors&apos; caretaker manager, Frank Barlow, sought an attacking outlet. Statistically the tactic seemed to work, since Spurs added only one goal after the break, the substitute Darren Bent converting Jenas&apos;s through-ball off a post. But it alleviated only some of the pressure and Kirkland tipped Berbatov&apos;s 81st-minute drive against the post, Younes Kaboul hitting the bar with the rebound. &quot;The thing that I am more happy about is that we kept a clean sheet in three of the four matches I am here,&quot; added Ramos, whose side moved to 14th with this win. Against Blackpool, Tel Aviv and now Wigan - Ramos will learn that like Berbatov English football is not like this every week. Man of the match Dimitar Berbatov (Tottenham) Whelan hunt widens Wigan Athletic will use the international break to appoint a new manager, meaning the next incumbent will take his bow at Arsenal. The chairman, Dave Whelan, who was in Barbados yesterday, has made overtures towards Scotland&apos;s manager, Alex McLeish, and England&apos;s Under-21 manager, Stuart Pearce. Both have indicated that the job is not for them.  Although reports have linked Graeme Souness with the position it is understood the former Newcastle United manager has not been approached. Instead Whelan will redouble his efforts to persuade Paul Jewell, the man who kept Wigan in the Premier League on the final day of last season, to return to the club.

Israel, he said, will treat their match with Russia in Tel Aviv on Saturday as the &quot;most important&quot; game in the qualifying Group E. If England are to have any chance of qualifying going into their final match, against Croatia at Wembley next Wednesday, they need Israel to at least draw with Russia. Israel cannot qualify for the finals but Aouate said yesterday that his side would not do Russia any favours and that Uefa points, professionalism, pride and personal friendships are all at stake. &quot;I&apos;m not bothered that people are saying we don&apos;t care about the result,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t pay any attention to comments like that but anyone who says we don&apos;t care about winning this match is wrong. England can rest assured that we will do everything we can to win this match. &quot;My favourite is England. I like England, I like English football and I have English friends. My mate Yossi Benayoun, our captain, also has a lot of English mates at Liverpool and although he&apos;s not playing [on Saturday] I know he&apos;s keen for us to give England a helping hand. &quot; &quot;But first of all we want to win for ourselves. Not for England, for Israel. We know that we can&apos;t qualify but the points could be useful for us in terms of our ranking when it comes to the World Cup qualifiers: whether we&apos;re in pot A, B, or C [in the draw on November 25] could depend on how many points we manage to rack up this time round and that could have an important bearing on our chances. Besides, we are always professional about every match we play and Israel is a really proud country. At home that&apos;s all the more important: we want to give our fans something to cheer about. &quot;We will approach this game as if it was the most important match in the group. We will all be together in a hotel before the game as usual, we will prepare in the right way, train hard and watch videos of Russia just like we did before playing England or Croatia. &quot;We drew with Russia away and we are not an easy team to beat at home. We have a very good record in Israel and it won&apos;t be at all easy for Russia. We drew with England [at home] and we felt we should have beaten Croatia - we paid dearly for our mistakes in that game and we were really annoyed about that. We always, always want to win and at home we can beat anyone.&quot; Aouate said that &quot;England still have to beat Croatia, you know&quot; and suggested Steve McClaren&apos;s side had failed to use the talent at their disposal. &quot;I think England are better than Russia when you look at the names in their side but they have not been able to prove that they are as good as those names suggest,&quot; he said. &quot;Russia are an improving, emerging team with a lot of promise and they are more of team than England - they work as more of a collective unit.&quot; Benayoun, however, said he was more interested in getting fit than helping England. The midfielder suffered a groin injury in Liverpool&apos;s 2-0 victory against Fulham last Saturday and is expected to be out for three weeks. Benayoun was expected to play a key role against Russia and, according to the player, some Liverpool team-mates are disappointed. &quot;Steven Gerrard and Peter Crouch have been driving me crazy in the last few weeks,&quot; Benayoun told Israel&apos;s Sport 5 television. &quot;But my health is more important than England&apos;s needs and I must rest and take care of myself.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-13T00:10:15Z", "title": "Football: Aouate says Israel will do all they can to keep English hopes alive", "sentences": ["Israel, he said, will treat their match with Russia in Tel Aviv on Saturday as the &quot;most important&quot; game in the qualifying Group E.

For all the excitement and the tension, this has, after all, been a scruffy Russian championship. Zenit St Petersburg won&apos;t care - and nor should they - but nor should it be denied that when Radek Sirl&apos;s 14th-minute shot deflected past the Saturn goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky on Sunday, it rather summed up this season. &quot;We were lucky,&quot; Zenit midfielder Konstantin Zyryanov admitted. &quot;But sometimes you need that.&quot; This was Zenit&apos;s first championship since 1984, only the second in their history, and the first time the title has gone outside Moscow since 1995. A packed Petrovsky Stadium watched the game via a beam-back in St Petersburg and, if not excusable, it was understandable that their celebrations should spill over into clashes with riot police that led to around 50 arrests. Yet even in their glee, there must be a slight sense of hollowness, for the blunt truth is that Zenit are not great champions. They are not even as good as they themselves have been at times in the recent past, but what they have had is consistency. Dick Advocaat has brought a tactical discipline, and the Ukraine international Anatoliy Tymoschuk, after an uncertain start, has added steel to the midfield. Those are laudable qualities and had it simply been that Advocaat had brought success by eliminating defensive sloppiness there would have been few complaints. But there have been more than a few complaints - many, it must be said, emanating from the Moscow press. That Zenit have been &quot;dry&quot; has been a common criticism. For the past month or so it has been routine in Moscow when discussing the title race to point out that Vladimir Putin was born in St Petersburg, although why that should matter given he has shown virtually no interest in football is unclear. Perhaps it does suit some vague policy of supporting the regions, but quite how that should have been brought about - other than by the obvious investment from Zenit&apos;s sponsors, Gazprom - has never been explained. The more valid criticism is that this was a title won almost by default. The headlines in Sovetsky Sport and Sport-Express both punned on the Peter the Great/Peter the First theme, but the truth was that this season was more about Spartak the Second. This was the third season in a row the Moscow club have finished as runners up, and this season they have only themselves to blame. Twice they outplayed Zenit this season, and twice they beat them 3-1, but they were undone by sloppiness in other fixtures. The 3-0 defeat to Khimki was a particular embarrassment, but they will look also at the 4-3 reverse against Lokomotiv in a game in which they had led 2-0, and even to the two points dropped in injury time against CSKA. CSKA themselves will wonder what might have been had they not lost Daniel Carvalho and Igor Akinfeev to lengthy injuries, and Jo and Wagner Love to the Copa America. The biggest underachievers, though, were Lokomotiv, who finished a lowly seventh and responded by sacking their coach Anatoly Byshovets on Monday. Remarkably he wasn&apos;t even the first coach to go after the season&apos;s end, with FK Moskva getting rid of Leonid Slutsky despite finishing fourth, the best placing in their brief history. But for all the quibbling, what Zenit have had, beyond question, is the best player in the Russian league: Andrei Arshavin. He began slowly, apparently pining for his former strike partner Alexander Kerzhakov, who was sold to Sevilla, but by the end of the season he was being granted the curiously back-handed compliment of being named by the British press as the only Russia player who might get in the England team. Although Roman Pavlyuchenko took most of the plaudits, Arshavin was probably Russia&apos;s best player against England in Moscow last month, his touch and awareness central to the red surge that overwhelmed Steve McClaren&apos;s side in that final half hour. It is perhaps a sign of his growing maturity that he looked better once Kerzhakov had gone off, and he found in Pavlyuchenko a counterpoint with bulk as well as guile. Given his evident flair and creative spirit, it is perhaps no great surprise to learn that Arshavin holds a university diploma in fashion design. After the England game, Patrick Barclay of the Sunday Telegraph made the observation that he reminded him of Deco, and the comparison is valid. Although Arshavin plays higher up the pitch, he shares with the Barcelona midfielder a similar slightness of physique, deftness of touch and willingness to work even outside his natural position; it would be no great surprise were he to follow Kerzhakov west. The other revelation this season has not been one of the vaunted imports, but Zyryanov, a player who has overcome the tragedy of losing his wife and daughter five years ago. A holding player at Torpedo, he has been given a more advanced role this season, and has responded with nine goals. His reward has been a regular starting berth in the national side. It was his goal incorrectly ruled out at Wembley, and his shirt Wayne Rooney rashly tugged to concede the penalty at the Luzhniki. For both he and Arshavin - as well as Vyacheslav Malafeev, Alexander Anyukov, Vladislav Radimov and Pavel Pogrebnyak - it has already been a wonderful year, but on Saturday in Tel Aviv an even bigger prize awaits. &quot;Words can&apos;t describe how happy I am,&quot; said Pogrebnyak. &quot;But if Russia now can beat Israel as well...&quot; Then, barring a catastrophe (or miracle, depending whose side you&apos;re on) in Andorra, Russia will be at Euro 2008, and England will not.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-13T11:10:43Z", "title": "Jonathan Wilson on Zenit St Petersburg's Russian championship", "sentences": ["For both he and Arshavin - as well as Vyacheslav Malafeev, Alexander Anyukov, Vladislav Radimov and Pavel Pogrebnyak - it has already been a wonderful year, but on Saturday in Tel Aviv an even bigger prize awaits."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/13/europeanfootball.zenitstpetersburg"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Guus Hiddink has said he expects a tough game in Israel, where victory would all but secure his Russia team a place at Euro 2008, almost certainly at England&apos;s expense.

Silkman is refusing to respond to a 60-page document sent by the FA, demanding that he explain 123 payments into and out of his bank accounts from January 2004-January 2006, the period covered by Quest&apos;s Premier League inquiry. &quot;I do not see that they have the right to this personal information,&quot; he argues. &quot;The Quest inquiry was supposed to be into whether bungs were paid to club managers or chief executives, but they cleared them all, so no bungs were paid. That means the questions they are asking me have nothing to do with them.&quot; Still recognisably the restless cockney who played, socks rolled down, for Crystal Palace and Manchester City in the 1970s - although his hair has thinned a little, and tummy thickened - Silkman took me to a north London caff last week with some of the paperwork to explain his objections. He had replied to Quest&apos;s initial inquiries in July last year, then Quest wrote back on November 1 2006 to say his response was incomplete. It said he had told it that he had acted during the period only in the transfer of the Brazilian midfielder Fabio Rochemback from Barcelona to Middlesbrough, when in fact Quest had discovered he worked on seven other moves: DJ Campbell (to Birmingham City, January 2006), Mikael Forssell (also to Birmingham, June 2005), Doriva (to Middlesbrough, new contract June 2005), Nwankwo Kanu (to West Bromwich Albion, July 2004), Luis Rodr\u00edguez (to Ipswich Town, August 2005), Abel Xavier (to Middlesbrough, January 2006) and Yakubu Ayegbeni (to Middlesbrough, July 2005). Silkman denies that he withheld information, but Quest asked him to confirm he had been involved in those transfers and to complete standard questionnaires for them. It also asked for further details on the Rochemback transfer, including an explanation of why, out of the fee he received from Middlesbrough, Silkman paid the Israeli agent Pini Zahavi. Quest asked him, more generally, to &quot;please clarify your relationship with Pini Zahavi&quot;. He was similarly asked to &quot;clarify&quot; his relationships with Birmingham City and Middlesbrough. Quest asked to see Silkman&apos;s bank statements and was allowed to inspect them on May 11 this year. It responded in June, asking him to explain 123 payments and asking to see a further bank account, into which Zahavi had paid him money after Yakubu&apos;s transfer. He did not have time to respond - his solicitor only sent the queries on to him on June 19 - before the Quest inquiry stopped and Lord Stevens&apos; company wrote its final report. On June 15 the Premier League released a &quot;key findings&quot; summary, 2\u00bd pages which named Silkman, Zahavi and others, calling on the FA and Fifa to investigate. On Silkman, it said there were questions relating to &quot;[Zahavi&apos;s] relationship with and payments to Barry Silkman&quot; and &quot;Barry Silkman&apos;s failure to initially disclose his involvement in all the transactions in which he received fees&quot;. The &quot;key findings&quot; report did not, though, say whether he should be investigated or disciplined for either of those questions. Quest then handed its paperwork to the FA, which was supposed to investigate further, and Silkman says the FA wrote to him in September listing the same bank payments, asking him again what each was for - whether it related to a player transfer, what service was provided for the money, and for a copy of the invoice supporting it. He rejects it as an unreasonable invasion of his affairs, not supported by any concrete findings or suspicions that he may have paid a bung, which was the purpose of the Premier League&apos;s inquiry. The amounts highlighted include several which are comparatively small, about which Silkman is vitriolic. &quot;Why do they want to know who a cheque for \u00a33,000 was for?&quot; he fumed. &quot;Do you pay someone a bung with a \u00a33,000 cheque?&quot; Other fees illustrate the riches attainable by football agents; the largest was \u00a3238,199.26, paid to Silkman on August 12 2005 by the Turkish club Besiktas. He said it was for the Brazilian midfielder Kleberson&apos;s move from Manchester United, for \u00a32.5m, four days earlier. &quot;It looks a lot,&quot; he acknowledged, &quot;but I had to pay other people; there were about eight agents involved. When you do a deal abroad you don&apos;t just pull it out of thin air. But the Quest inquiry was about transfers of players into Premier League clubs, so what has a transfer to a club abroad got to do with them?&quot; On some payments, the FA noted &quot;no clarification necessary&quot; - \u00a3174,961.03 was Silkman&apos;s fee for Doriva&apos;s move; \u00a329,375 the Forssell fee. The money paid out of his account also varied, between several of a couple of thousand pounds to larger ones, with some, such as two payments of \u00a3148,900 in April and May 2004, transferred to foreign bank accounts. &quot;I had to pay people, other agents I worked with,&quot; he explained. As for his relationship with Zahavi, it dates back 27 years, to when Zahavi, then a football journalist in Israel, brokered Silkman&apos;s loan move from Manchester City to Maccabi Tel Aviv and so discovered that the pay for such work is just a tad more generous than the going rate for sportswriters. When Silkman retired he became a licensed agent, and he and Zahavi work together on some deals. Silkman explained that Rochemback&apos;s move was the most complicated he had ever worked on; the Brazilian was signed to Barcelona but on loan at Sporting Lisbon; they had to persuade Barcelona to part with him, find a replacement player for Sporting Lisbon, who came eventually from the Portuguese club Braga, then persuade both players to join their new clubs. &quot;Pini knows Barcelona well, and I paid him half my fee, \u0080500,000, because without him the deal couldn&apos;t happen. I had Steve McClaren and Steve Gibson constantly calling me in the early hours, and we did it minutes before the window closed. Afterwards Pini invoiced me and I paid his fee into his bank account.&quot; When Yakubu signed in July 2005, Middlesbrough paid Zahavi a fee rising to \u00a33m and he gave Silkman a cut, a long-standing arrangement because Silkman was instrumental in spotting Yakubu early in the striker&apos;s career. &quot;Pini is a trusted friend,&quot; Silkman said. &quot;I owe him my position in football, the house I live in, everything. What does my relationship with Pini have to do with Quest, or with bungs?&quot; The FA would not comment on its post-Quest inquiries, except to point to regulations requiring agents to cooperate with requests for information or face a misconduct charge. Silkman objects. &quot;My cooperation is over. I&apos;m tired of it. If they found a manager or chief executive who received money from me, then let them pursue me. But they haven&apos;t. They&apos;ve cleared all the club officials. If they have something to accuse me of, they should do it. If not, they should leave me alone.&quot; Incomplete inquiry Barry Silkman&apos;s correspondence with Quest reveals how far from complete the Premier League&apos;s inquiry into alleged &apos;bungs&apos; was, both in December 2006, when it released an interim report, and in June this year, when the inquiry was closed. In December 2006, Quest &apos;cleared&apos; 345 of the 362 deals, including several moves on which Silkman worked, yet at that point the investigators had not even seen Silkman&apos;s bank statements, let alone traced the flow of his money. On June 15 2007 the Premier League announced the inquiry was being handed over to the Football Association, and released &apos;key findings&apos; from Quest&apos;s final report. It raised questions about several agents, including Silkman, and managers, but cleared all club officials of receiving bungs. Yet even by then Quest had only just asked Silkman further questions about his bank statements, and Quest had similarly not received full details from other agents. A Premier League spokesman confirmed that the \u00a31.1m inquiry closed before Quest completed its investigations. &apos;It moved to this new phase, in which the FA is pursuing questions for agents, because the clubs had all given their full cooperation,&apos; he said. If, though, new evidence came to light, questions for the clubs could be reopened.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-14T00:33:04Z", "title": "Football: David Conn: Silkman refuses to assist FA", "sentences": ["As for his relationship with Zahavi, it dates back 27 years, to when Zahavi, then a football journalist in Israel, brokered Silkman&apos;s loan move from Manchester City to Maccabi Tel Aviv and so discovered that the pay for such work is just a tad more generous than the going rate for sportswriters."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/14/sport.comment"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock"], "article": "Hometown: Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem and Brooklyn.

Over the next two years of constant gigging in dives barely visible to the naked eye as well as proper big outdoor festivals and medium-sized dancehalls, Apples songs took shape.

It&apos;s Israel v Russia this weekend - are your boys going to help England out of a Steve McClaren-sized hole? I hope so. They will be trying very hard. The more the media is involved, the more motivation you have. All Israeli players want to play in England, and this game is a huge chance to prove themselves. But there&apos;s nothing in it for Israel is there? You might think that Small Talk, but I was myself involved in a match in 1993 against France. We had nothing to play for, but we tried everything to win the game and we did win - maybe the best win in Israeli history. I have to put myself in the position of the players. They are professional. They want to win the game, to do their best because it&apos;s good for their career. That&apos;s enough to suggest that Israel are going to try to win the game, regardless of the situation with England. And of course you beat them in Moscow ... No, we drew. Ah. Moving swiftly on, what are you up to these days? I live here [in England]. I&apos;m a football consultant, so I just try to give the best advice for the clubs - not only in England, but abroad. I help them find foreign players. I cannot help them with local players - they know them already - but they know less about players abroad. So who have been your big successes? Listen, I don&apos;t want publicity. I had enough when I was a player. It&apos;s enough that you say I am a football consultant. Right you are then. So what are you doing in London when you could be swanning around a beach in Tel Aviv? I&apos;ll tell you why I&apos;m here. My two boys, they were born here. They are like normal English boys. My wife is not Israeli, she is Belgian. So we feel at home here. Also, my son is playing for the Watford academy. Oh yes. Is he any good? It&apos;s still early days - he&apos;s only 11. He&apos;s playing in midfield but they play a bit all over. But every year that any player, not only my son, survives in the academy it&apos;s a good sign, because it&apos;s hard. You&apos;re looking a bit different these days - you&apos;ve got no hair, for a start ... Yes, I&apos;m shaving my head. It has not fallen out. Is that some kind of disguise so no one recognises you and asks you about that miss against Villa? Listen, I&apos;m used to it. If you asked me if I&apos;d want to do it again I&apos;d say yes, because it put me on the map. I laugh. Really? Yes, Small Talk, I do. You know why people don&apos;t forget this? When a player who never played at the top misses a goal, no one ever remembers. You only remember a miss of a player who made it to the top. Do you ever get asked about that hat-trick for Spurs against Southampton? Yes, but it was not for me the best. That was the hat-trick on my full debut for Liverpool. That was the better one because it really boosted my career. But the one against Southampton was in a live game - more people were watching, so it became a little bit famous. It&apos;s always nice to be remembered. Now on to the important stuff. Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger? [He answers in a jiffy, and with great confidence] A lion! So confident! But why? Because if they are the same age the lion is supposed to be bigger. Stronger. Very well thought out. Paris Hilton or Scarlett Johansson? Listen, I&apos;ve never heard of this Scarlett, and I don&apos;t know Paris Hilton either - but I read about her in the newspaper. I will say my wife. Fair enough. Cheese or chocolate? That&apos;s a good question. Yes, that&apos;s what we think Yes. Because I like both of them. But I think in the end chocolate would win for me.

They have a great home record.&quot; Something a little more tangible to the home coach&apos;s players, however, might be the \u00a350,000 Mercedes that Betfred&apos;s owner, Fred Done, is offering to any Israel player who scores the winning goal against Guus Hiddink&apos;s side. Done, moreover, is confident England will qualify somehow. His firm will lay you 12-1 about McClaren&apos;s side winning Euro 2008 with the insurance that if they do not qualify punters&apos; money will be returned, with the caveat that all bets must be placed before the Israel v Russia kick-off. Although that price has shrunk from the 20-1 available last Saturday, when the concession was first announced, it remains a bet to nothing. Should England qualify bettors can lay the bet off at a shorter price thus guaranteeing profit whereas if they fail the money is returned. Those with more faith can back England at 20-1 (Bet Direct and Ladbrokes) to win Euro 2008 or 9-4 (Totesport) to qualify for the finals. Ladbrokes offers just 2-5 they miss out featuring at the finals of a major tournament for the first time since 1994. At the head of the outright market, Germany are 11-2 (Coral) favourites, Italy 7-1 (Ladbrokes), Holland 8-1 (general), France 8-1 (general) and Spain 9-1 (Ladbrokes). A better bet to win Euro 2008 could be Portugal at 10-1 (general). They lost to Greece in the final in the last European Championship before reaching the semi-finals in last summer&apos;s World Cup so a speculative each-way ante-post punt at double-figure odds could reap rewards. For the game all England fans will be watching tomorrow, Russia are 8-15 (Stan James), Israel 13-2 (Bet365) with the draw 16-5 (Bet365). The pair drew 1-1 in Moscow just over a year ago, but then Israel, obviously, had something to play for. Without the injured Yossi Benayoun Israel look short of creativity and, as they have not scored in their last two qualifiers, they probably will not trouble a Russian side that have managed seven clean sheets in 10 Group E fixtures. Paddy Power&apos;s offer of 4-5 about Russia shutting out Israel, therefore, looks worth taking. Of course McClaren will be hoping Israel can also keep a clean sheet (9-2 with Paddy Power) as their defeat could mean the end of his reign as England&apos;s head coach. Ladbrokes offers 4-6 that tonight&apos;s friendly with Austria will be his last in charge of the national side, with Martin O&apos;Neill 5-2 favourite to take over. England are 4-5 (Totesport) to beat Austria, who trade at 9-2 (Bet365) with the draw 5-2 (Boyle Sports and Power). Whether next Wednesday&apos;s qualifier against Croatia will have any meaning is unknown, so bookmakers are reluctant to price it up. Paddy Power, though, go 5-1 about Slaven Bilic&apos;s side winning at Wembley, with England 1-2 and 5-2 the draw. Scotland are 5-2 (Power) to make it to Austria and Switzerland next year and 1-3 (general) not to. They will definitely qualify if they defeat Italy. Alex McLeish&apos;s men are rated as 11-4 (general) to do so, the world champions 11-10 (general) and the draw 9-4 (Betfred). The Azzurri have won their last four away qualifiers but a draw would almost certainly be enough for them to qualify as they play the Faroe Islands next Wednesday at home in their last Group B fixture. Scotland are unbeaten at home during qualification and have not failed to score on home turf for more than two years. The last two meetings at Hampden Park between these two sides ended all square and that looks the best bet tomorrow.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T00:02:32Z", "title": "Dan Roebuck: Beat Russia and win a Merc - that's a Done deal for Israel and punters", "sentences": ["For that to happen, of course, Israel must take points off Russia in Tel Aviv tomorrow."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/16/sport.comment"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Rarely can an England fixture have felt this irrelevant but when Steve McClaren&apos;s mind drifts away from Tel Aviv and his future job prospects and back to team selection and tactics he will face an unfamiliar problem at the Ernst Happel stadium this evening.  His team have been shorn of two mainstays for next Wednesday&apos;s qualifying finale against Croatia and, in case that fixture still offers a route to Euro 2008, the defensive deputies would do well to prove their abilities in this evening&apos;s friendly against Austria. McClaren would conjure a wry smile at the idea that if the Croats must be beaten it will have to be by a side denied the suspended Rio Ferdinand and the injured captain John Terry. Too often during his 16-month reign, the manager would suggest, he has been robbed of key personnel and now, in what could prove to be his final week in charge, he must send out a team lacking both of his defensive linchpins for the first time. Either Terry or Ferdinand has played in each of the six combinations McClaren has employed at the heart of the team&apos;s defence to date. Instinct suggests that to be without both would render his team even more fragile. McClaren would argue otherwise, however. Indeed, of all the positions in which England are occasionally found wanting, there must surely be optimism at the options available for central defence. &quot;This team may have benefited from the continuity having players like Terry and Ferdinand has offered,&quot; said the former England defender Gary Mabbutt. &quot;But if you actually look at the list of players who are waiting for their chance and, in my opinion, could fill in effectively and successfully, centre-half is an England strength, not a weakness.&quot; A seventh combination will be flung together tonight, with McClaren having chosen to pair the vastly experienced Sol Campbell with the relative rookie Joleon Lescott. The Portsmouth centre-back is 33 and will win his 72nd cap against the Austrians, his knowhow at this level stretching back 11 years and through the reigns of five full-time England managers. Lescott is still establishing his credentials at Everton having endured something of a torrid baptism in his first international, the Wembley win against Estonia, and on his first start, at left-back against Russia. He would have been considered seventh choice at best at the start of the current qualification campaign, when Everton had signed him from Wolves in the Championship and the established order was Ferdinand, Terry, Jonathan Woodgate, Ledley King, Campbell and Jamie Carragher. Yet his presence in tonight&apos;s line-up hardly gives England a soft underbelly. &quot;He&apos;s given us all the right signs that he will flourish at international level,&quot; said Everton&apos;s manager, David Moyes. &quot;He has pace and strength, is young and is a very good listener. He wants to improve all the time, so he will learn and keep getting better.&quot; Lescott, 25, himself admitted to being &quot;a bit disappointed&quot; with his performance in Russia. &quot;But when you play behind him you have no doubts as to his ability,&quot; said his club goalkeeper, Tim Howard. &quot;He&apos;s got the ability and size to be a tremendous defender and he shows that at club level. There is a composure that makes him stand out. Playing at left-back will actually have helped him but he has all the attributes you would want as a centre-half.&quot; That combination will have their opportunity against Austria tonight, although there are other central defenders in the wings to back up the conviction that England boast strength in depth.  Micah Richards&apos; physique, even at 19, and his leaping ability suggest he is a centre-back in the making at international level, having already excelled there with Manchester City this season. &quot;Micah may end up thriving there, and there&apos;s even Wes Brown in the current squad, but look outside that group and you see there is a wealth of talent out there,&quot; added Mabbutt, who won 16 caps. &quot;We have players of the calibre of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate injured, Michael Dawson at Spurs, then the younger generation of Steven Taylor at Newcastle, Nedum Onuoha at Manchester City and even David Wheater at Middlesbrough. &quot;There must be 13 centre-halves out there who would be capable of filling in in that position, either now or in the near future, all playing in probably the best league in the world and definitely against the best strikers in the world. &quot;That is offering the kind of depth you need if you are attempting to win silverware. Teams don&apos;t win championships; squads win championships. The manager will look at the options available to him and he should be encouraged that we have enough quality to cover even when players as good as Terry and Ferdinand are unavailable.&quot; For now the onus on England is simply in attempting to qualify for a major championship, but in the deputies McClaren can trust.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T00:39:53Z", "title": "Beware: England box contains hard centres", "sentences": ["Rarely can an England fixture have felt this irrelevant but when Steve McClaren&apos;s mind drifts away from Tel Aviv and his future job prospects and back to team selection and tactics he will face an unfamiliar problem at the Ernst Happel stadium this evening."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/16/newsstory.sport6"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "For Steve McClaren, whose job prospects hang by the gossamer hopes of England qualifying for Euro 2008, tomorrow&apos;s fixture between Russia and Israel in Tel Aviv is the worst conceivable combination of opponents. If the large Russian-immigrant population in Israel binds the two nations, the links between their football cultures run even deeper. Predictably it is the Israeli agent Pini Zahavi and Chelsea&apos;s Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, who form the hub of the network. Zahavi&apos;s contacts delivered the west London club to an oligarch looking for a foothold in football and from that moment on, the connections between Israel and Russia in the game have been galvanised. The highest-profile element was the appointment of Avram Grant to the post of Chelsea manager, a seemingly meteoric rise to the top table for the former Israel manager. But Abramovich&apos;s influence on Grant&apos;s career extends further. Zahavi had introduced Abramovich to Grant at Israel&apos;s World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland and the pair struck up a rapport that led to his recruitment as Portsmouth&apos;s director of football. Pompey&apos;s chairman, Alexandre Gaydamak, agreed to the move as a favour to Abramovich, who like his father, Arkady, is a member of the Russian billionaires&apos; circle. Gaydamak Sr ploughed more than \u00a320m into Beitar Jerusalem, transforming them into the Ligat ha&apos;Al leaders and the national team&apos;s most represented club. He is also behind the Social Justice political party and is only one of many football investors to consider the game useful in currying popular support. Hopes were raised in Israeli football boardrooms that similar ambitions might draw other super-rich businessmen to the game after a tournament involving Russian, Ukrainian and Israeli clubs here in February. The Channel One Cup attracted ministers, MPs and oligarchs and again Abramovich took centre stage. The Chelsea owner&apos;s Football Academy Foundation, which has financed numerous football facilities across Russia, provides the $8m (\u00a34m) funding for the tournament. If England are effectively put out of Euro 2008 tomorrow, conspiracy theorists might focus on how that money indirectly goes towards funding youth development programmes in Israeli football. A $1m share went to the winners, CSKA Moscow, and $500,000 to their city rivals Spartak. The other four participating teams, which included Hapoel Tel Aviv, who coincidentally have the hammer-and-sickle motif for their logo, and Maccabi Haifa, shared a further $500,000 of which half must be spent on youth development. Stories emerged in the Russian press that Abramovich was seeking a purchaser for Hapoel after a deal involving Lev Leviev, an ultra-Orthodox multi-millionaire property developer, fell through, although the reports were denied. Rumours also circulated earlier this year about a possible takeover of Maccabi Tel Aviv. It was said that the Spartak Moscow director, Sergey Shavlo, was putting together a consortium with the Israeli businessmen Meir Shamir and David Federman with a view to buying the club. Zahavi&apos;s name is never far from such talk. Alongside his partner Eli Azur, Zahavi is a significant investor in the Mirkaei Tikshoret media group, whose football rights include those to the World Cup. The agent is currently working on a project in the far east and was unavailable for comment. Everybody connected with tomorrow&apos;s match denies that there will be any suggestion of foul play, with many stating that Israel are a difficult team to beat at home. But it will be hard to distinguish which is the home team: Abramovich is rumoured to have purchased 1,000 tickets himself, and the Israeli federation yesterday announced that with less than \u00a31m worth of gate receipts having so far been generated, more than \u00a3500,000 worth of tickets had been sold to Russians. McClaren blamed the French referee for awarding a penalty against Wayne Rooney in Moscow last month rather than analysing his own errors.

Tonight&apos;s friendly with Austria cannot truly dominate Steve McClaren&apos;s mind. His life is hedged by events that are about to happen elsewhere. The vigil continues in the run-up to the matches that Russia and Croatia play tomorrow, but the air is also full of conversations that will be given voice if England fail to reach Euro 2008. McClaren himself referred to a &quot;nice little chat&quot; he had recently with the FA chief executive, Brian Barwick, about routine topics. The manager reported that his future had not been under review. &quot;I believe I&apos;ll survive,&quot; he said. None the less, he seems to sense that the tempo of events is quickening. Asked about the situation should England&apos;s interest, in effect, be ended tomorrow by a Russia win in Israel and a draw for Croatia in Macedonia, he said: &quot;We&apos;ll find out on Saturday night and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll get a statement, a response, if that happens.&quot; That might really be a breach of protocol by the FA since Russia would still have to complete the formality of beating Andorra next Wednesday, but the yearning on the part of McClaren and his employers to settle matters is almost overwhelming. The manager will retreat to the reassurance of his own living room and watch the other group matches with the company of his sons in Yarm tomorrow. He draws strength from the recollection that he was at risk of being dismissed by Middlesbrough in 2006, not long before he was appointed England manager. &quot;I&apos;ve come through adversity in the past and I believe I will again,&quot; he said. There is little else to be done but restate his conviction that Russia will not win in Tel Aviv, meaning that England can qualify for Euro 2008 by defeating Croatia at Wembley. In the meantime there is an air of re-establishment to tonight&apos;s team selection. Frank Lampard, at the expense of Gareth Barry, reclaims the central midfied spot beside Steven Gerrard. David Beckham, who has not been capped since the friendly with Germany in August, is over his knee injury and starts on the right. The major innovation lies in a debut for Scott Carson. McClaren, having watched him in the England Under-21s, had promised him a cap whenever circumstances allowed, This, all the same, is no token honour for the Aston Villa goalkeeper. The manager, who has so often championed Paul Robinson, flatly declined to guarantee that the accident-prone Tottenham player would be between the posts against Croatia. Robinson&apos;s errors, culminating in a mistake for Russia&apos;s winner in Moscow, have done significant harm. Outfield players are blameworthy, too, but there is a starkness to a goalkeeper&apos;s existence. Other players, including Ashley Cole, Ashley Young and David Bentley, will feature as substitutes this evening. It is wintry in Vienna but the team will hope that the game can distract them from the blizzard of doubt over the Euro 2008 campaign. The derided opponents may have to be treated seriously. This match might not count for much but it is typical of England&apos;s luck that Austria should be exhibiting faint signs of life just as they arrive. A 3-2 victory over Ivory Coast in Innsbruck last month was Austria&apos;s first win in 10 matches. No one will want to brood on the fact that the score was 1-1 until the visitors&apos; defender, Steve Gohouri, was sent off. Josef Hickersberger&apos;s side have the humble ambition of escaping the infamy of being renowned as the most inadequate team ever to host a major tournament, when Euro 2008 comes to Austria and Switzerland. There is an incongruity about Hickersberger, who has been through such a gloomy period, now popping up to wish McClaren luck. When a person in the Austria coach&apos;s position feels sorry for you it confirms that you are in terrible, and conceivably terminal, trouble. The most comfort the England manager can hope for this evening would come in a respectable showing that put him in a good mood before he subjects himself to torment by television tomorrow.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T01:07:56Z", "title": "McClaren crosses his fingers and prays", "sentences": ["There is little else to be done but restate his conviction that Russia will not win in Tel Aviv, meaning that England can qualify for Euro 2008 by defeating Croatia at Wembley."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/16/newsstory.englandfootballteam"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Slaven Bilic, the Croatia coach, has identified overconfidence as the principal reason behind England&apos;s struggle to qualify for Euro 2008.

Maybe your [England&apos;s] approach was a little bit too self-confident in this campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;Because it is not easy to come to Croatia and to get something from a game. It is not easy to play in Russia. It is not easy to play Macedonia. And it&apos;s very difficult to play in Tel Aviv. So maybe you were expecting to cruise the group but it&apos;s a very difficult group.&quot; Bilic did, however, lend his support to the England manager, Steve McClaren: &quot;As a club manager you need a couple of years to make or build a team. In a national team you need three or four years because you do not have them every day. You have them once a month for five days. It&apos;s not Steve McClaren&apos;s fault and I really feel for him and hope he is going to continue.&quot; Croatia need a point against Macedonia in Skopje tonight to secure a place at next year&apos;s finals before Wednesday night&apos;s game against England at Wembley. And Bilic, who has seen his side win eight and draw two of their 10 games in Group E, is confident his side will perform in Skopje. &quot;We have a strong desire, motivation and great character which should ensure we make it,&quot; he told uefa.com. &quot;We play attacking football, more than half our team are attack-minded and we can play attacking football precisely because we have a good defence which opens up a number of options for us. We have not just conceded few goals but also limited our opponents to few opportunities.&quot; Croatia have conceded only four goals in 10 qualifiers and will be confident of another clean sheet today as Macedonia are without their top striker, Lazio&apos;s Goran Pandev. &quot;Of course I am glad that he is not playing,&quot; Bilic admitted. &quot;He is a great player and Macedonia look weaker without him on paper. However, it won&apos;t make our job much easier. Even without Pandev they are a good and strong team.&quot; Bilic has been forced to promote the Under-21 striker Marijo Mandzukic to his squad as three strikers - Dinamo Zagreb&apos;s Bosko Balaban, Hajduk Split&apos;s Nikola Kalinic and Parma&apos;s Igor Budan - are injured and a fourth, Borussia Dortmund&apos;s Mladen Petric, has only recently returned to training after concussion. England will be hoping Croatia suffer a shock defeat tonight, a result which would mean they could overtake them and qualify for Austria and Switzerland if they win by a three-goal margin on Wednesday - regardless of what Russia do in Israel. There is hope. Croatia struggled at home against Macedonia and drew 1-1 with Malta in an away game late in qualification for the 2006 World Cup. &quot;We are without Goran Pandev and we know what he means for our team but we&apos;ll try to give our best,&quot; said the Macedonia coach, Srecko Katanec. &quot;Croatia are the favourites but we will try to stage a surprise.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-17T00:06:50Z", "title": "Bilic accuses England of being too confident", "sentences": ["And it&apos;s very difficult to play in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/17/newsstory.sport3"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Russia"], "article": "The Israeli nation owes a debt of gratitude to Guus Hiddink&apos;s family, the national manager, Dror Kashtan, said yesterday. Kashtan&apos;s side take on Russia today with England&apos;s Euro 2008 ambitions effectively depending on the result and he took the opportunity to draw attention to the wartime actions of Hiddink&apos;s father. Gerrit Hiddink was an unemployed teacher in the Dutch village of Varsseveld during the second world war whose responsibility was organising the distribution of food vouchers to locals. According to Hiddink&apos;s brother, Hans, their father would fake break-ins at the depot so that he could take vouchers to pass to Jewish people hiding in nearby farm buildings. That courage was yesterday applauded by Kashtan. &quot;It is a matter that is part of the history of the Holocaust and that gives a warm place in our hearts for him and his family,&quot; he said. &quot;We all have a warm place in our heart for what they did to help the Jewish nation during the Holocaust.&quot; Hiddink Sr is now in his 90s and the Russia manager believes his father&apos;s charitable endeavours were only natural. &quot;My father is still alive and where you are born as a human being it&apos;s normal to help people in danger or in need,&quot; said Hiddink. &quot;It&apos;s curious when you talk to your father about this subject; 20, 30 years ago he wouldn&apos;t talk much about it. But getting older and with a little bit of provoking from me he started talking about the situation in the region where I was brought up. But I would say it is normal to help people in need.&quot; But despite Kashtan&apos;s gratitude, Hiddink does not anticipate that there will be any favours from the Israeli team. &quot;Being here we do expect a difficult game because Israel&apos;s record at home is rather strong,&quot; he said. &quot;The reason I was saying we&apos;re happy still to be in the competition is that over the past 1\u00bd years there have been changes in the Russia national team and we have been building with a young team. &quot;It would be good with youngsters to qualify for 2008 because they will get a huge acceleration in their young career. We know we face a difficult game but it&apos;s good for everyone to be here and to try to get a result that keeps us still in control for the upcoming games.&quot; Hiddink guarded against stating that the game is already up for Steve McClaren&apos;s men but he was willing to evaluate what the achievement would mean. In a gilded career that has seen Hiddink lift the European Cup with PSV Eindhoven, guide South Korea to a World Cup semi-final - matching what he managed with Holland in 1998 - and Australia to the knockout phase of the competition for the first time, Hiddink has already won many accolades. But he would draw much personal satisfaction from taking Russia to the European Championship in England&apos;s place. &quot;We have not got that far yet,&quot; he said. &quot;But, if it did happen, it would be a tremendous achievement from the team. &quot;It would be a tremendous improvement and acceleration of the process we are in in Russia. We are turning into a young, modern, more attractive-playing team with an average age of 24.&quot; Once that is delivered, Russia&apos;s football development - aided by the financial backing of Roman Abramovich - will enter a new phase. &quot;It will accelerate the process of improving the infrastructure in Russia,&quot; said Hiddink. &quot;The building of facilities, stadiums, training grounds; of renovating, of improving the youth-development structures, of scouting. It will accelerate this hugely if we can do so.&quot; It&apos;s all England&apos;s fault, says Israel captain Dudu Aouate, Israel&apos;s stand-in captain, last night told England that they have only themselves to blame if their European Championship hopes are effectively ended with an Israeli defeat in Tel Aviv today. The prospects look bleak for Steve McClaren&apos;s men after Shimon Gershon, who was due to take over the captaincy from the injured Yossi Benayoun, yesterday withdrew from the match. If Russia prevail here they have only to beat Andorra - whose 10 defeats in 10 Group E matches have brought 39 goals for opposition teams - to secure their place in the finals, and Aouate believes it will be England&apos;s deserts. &quot;All the talk of incentives: it is obvious people are trying to add more colour and spice,&quot; said the Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a keeper. &quot;England don&apos;t trust us. They had their fate in their own hands but that is not the case now. &quot;There is always talk of incentives, even in Spain. People in England say we haven&apos;t beaten a big team in a long time. England should have relied on themselves, they are big enough without needing a favour from anyone else. We will go and try to beat Russia.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-17T00:06:51Z", "title": "Hiddink expects no favours from a grateful Israel", "sentences": ["It will accelerate this hugely if we can do so.&quot; It&apos;s all England&apos;s fault, says Israel captain Dudu Aouate, Israel&apos;s stand-in captain, last night told England that they have only themselves to blame if their European Championship hopes are effectively ended with an Israeli defeat in Tel Aviv today."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/17/newsstory.sport5"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "When organising warm-up gigs for the forthcoming, final leg of my current tour my tour manager, Ian (City), and manager, Nik (United), asked if I wanted to keep Wednesday night free for the England match. Whether the game against Croatia is of any relevance will be determined tonight in Tel Aviv when Israel play Russia - if Russia don&apos;t win then England can still qualify for the European Championship with a victory against the group leaders at Wembley. In effect, my response to this inquiry will define me either as a patriotic optimist or an indifferent pessimist. Or, as is often the case in these times, there is a third way: I could remain essentially optimistic but affiliate myself only with the claret and blue corner of England where Bow bells chime and bubbles blow, like a Cornish separatist imagining new borders around a principality of the heart. We all know of the pledge, of course, where we swear to never again be seduced by a national side that only ever lets us down, an oath that is easier to remain faithful to if you&apos;re a fan of Manchester United or Arsenal and have a happy and successful domestic football life than if you follow Huddersfield, no disrespect, or even West Ham. But perhaps that constituency is now being diminished. Fans of the MK Dons could find more joy and triumph following their local team than by going to all the bother of daubing a St George&apos;s cross with Milton Keynes and traipsing off to Vienna. I can&apos;t seem to give up my England habit: although I&apos;ve never seen them play I have been inveigled by the trappings. Esso World Cup coins, for example, which bore the faces of the Italia 90 squad were as prized as richly as golden doubloons by my teenage self and while people fret and query the benefits of adopting the euro I campaign tirelessly in my mind to have them made our sole legal tender - a Peter Beardsley for a loaf of bread, a Chris Waddle for a day pass at Thorpe Park and a weeping Gazza for unlimited lap dances at Spearmint Rhino (they were very rare). Last week only 38 Englishmen played in the Premiership. Now I don&apos;t want to get all Oswald Mosley but is that enough? We&apos;re approaching the point where if you are a top-flight English footballer you can assume you&apos;ll be in the squad, just turn up at the airport in your PE kit and demand a chance. So perhaps Michel Platini and the brave Steven Gerrard are right, that there ought be a cap on foreign players or players should run out for the nation in which they earn their money. That might be quite good actually, not just because then &quot;England&quot; would be bloody brilliant but also David Beckham would have to play for the United States, probably as skipper, affording me the delightful opportunity to write an article entitled &quot;Captain America to the rescue&quot; which would be a breeze. It might even help to loosen the stranglehold that nationalism still has upon us, and our atavistic tribal instincts, to the point where we abandon the concept of the individual and gather in stadiums just to cheer the idea of collective consciousness - it would be much harder to tell who&apos;d won or when the game had finished and some people would still struggle with the offside rule but it might herald an age of global peace. When I was a lad and Liverpool won everything, folk would harp on about Sammy Lee being the only English player because that side was made up largely of home nations players. Others would say he was like a little barrel that had come to life in a Disney film set in a brewery but they contribute nought to this argument and can just eff off. I suppose what I&apos;m saying is that England will always underachieve, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be something we can correlate to club football in a direct way. If we don&apos;t qualify there is talk of having a home nations tournament, presuming that Scotland are also available, and some of my mates are more into that idea. &quot;Four meaningful matches,&quot; said John (Liverpool) and I&apos;d be interested to watch such a tourney, but it might feel a bit like the third-place matches in the World Cup where two teams of disillusioned failures vie for mediocrity. We&apos;d be pretending to care about our mini-matches but actually in our heart of hearts we&apos;d know we were watching a consolation cup, for little girls in their mum&apos;s high-heels tottering around, fancying themselves all adult but not contributing to the gas bill. I&apos;m doing my warm-up gigs on Monday and Tuesday night and keeping Wednesday free because I make decisions with my heart (especially now my goolies are out of action) so Wednesday I&apos;ll be watching England and I hope it&apos;ll be consequential. I know it&apos;ll be a lot more relaxed than the front room in Yarm where Steve McClaren will watch tonight&apos;s other group matches with his sons and a loudly ticking clock. russell.brand@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2007-11-17T00:09:31Z", "title": "Russell Brand: I need a new way to feed my England habit", "sentences": ["Whether the game against Croatia is of any relevance will be determined tonight in Tel Aviv when Israel play Russia - if Russia don&apos;t win then England can still qualify for the European Championship with a victory against the group leaders at Wembley."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/17/newsstory.sport19"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "The folly of playing a friendly fixture five days before a match in which England could, against the odds, secure a place in Euro 2008 was cruelly exposed last night when Steve McClaren saw Michael Owen limp off with a thigh strain that rules him out of the final qualifier against Croatia. An early assessment of the injury suggests Owen will be missing for up to a month, which represents not only a significant setback for his Newcastle United club, but also another hammer blow for the beleaguered McClaren. The England coach will watch Russia take on Israel this evening at his home in Yarm with the national side&apos;s fate effectively being played out in Tel Aviv. However, if the Russians offer a reprieve by failing to win, McClaren will now be taking on Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday without his most experienced striker. &quot;It means we will be going into what could be our biggest game for some time without our first-choice strikers [Owen and Wayne Rooney] and our two regular centre-backs [John Terry and Rio Ferdinand],&quot; said a deflated McClaren after the 1-0 win over Austria in Vienna, a victory secured by Peter Crouch&apos;s 13th goal in 24 international appearances. &quot;These things can happen - Wayne Rooney gets an ankle injury playing head tennis,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;It&apos;s a big blow, but you have to deal with it. There&apos;s a possibility we&apos;ll call up another striker into the squad, but I think there&apos;s enough in that dressing room, anyway.&quot; The only obvious replacement would be Tottenham&apos;s Darren Bent, a player yet to score at top international level. Owen&apos;s injury happened in attempting to dispatch his only goal opportunity, pummelling a shot just after the half-hour mark from Crouch&apos;s clever lay-off and seeing Alex Manninger palm the ball away. His discomfort was immediate, and Jermain Defoe rose from the bench to replace him. &quot;It was a strange one,&quot; said McClaren. &quot;It was his standing foot and he pulled his thigh, and it leaves us short for strikers. We just seem to be plagued with injuries. We have certainly had our fair share of not having our best players available. It is a reason, but it&apos;s not an excuse. The conditions didn&apos;t contribute to it. We trained at Arsenal on Thursday and it was just as cold, if not colder. But it&apos;s been a difficult week and a difficult preparation for this game. In the circumstances, I thought the players came through well.&quot; The logic in playing this friendly could be called into question, even if the Football Association could not have envisaged England having their destiny taken out of their hands going into the final round of qualifying games. The Croatia match could be rendered meaningless - should Russia win, with the formality of a visit to Andorra to come, and Croatia not lose in Macedonia tonight - but, on the off-chance that England retain hope beyond this evening, this was McClaren&apos;s nightmare scenario. He clung instead to the hour played out by David Beckham as the former captain strives for some kind of match fitness - &quot;He&apos;ll be better for that,&quot; McClaren said - although the midfielder was well off the pace throughout the match. The displays of Joleon Lescott at centre-back, Crouch up front and the substitute Ashley Young offered glimmers of encouragement on a drab occasion, with many of England&apos;s 4,000 travelling support forced to leave the stadium early because their return flights were diverted via Bratislava. &quot;I&apos;m as confident as anyone can be that Israel will give it their all against Russia,&quot; added McClaren. &quot;It&apos;s turned into a big game for them. There&apos;s so much media attention. Believe you me, the Israel players won&apos;t see this as a meaningless game. There&apos;s a lot riding on it for them - their home record, their pride, but also the focus of attention on them.&quot; Owen and out April 1999 Misses Euro 2000 qualifiers against Sweden and Bulgaria with hamstring and tendon injuries June 2000  Withdrawn at half-time as England lose to Portugal at European Championship September 2001  Hamstring trouble rules him out of England&apos;s final 2002 World Cup qualifier against Greece December 2005  Breaks metatarsal and makes only four further appearances before the 2006 World Cup June 2006  Ruptures knee ligaments against Sweden, below, in England&apos;s final group game at the World Cup.

What&apos;s not to like? Sing the right song  Leaving aside the politically contentious and the parochial, the favoured chant of the Israeli football fan is probably &quot;El, El, Israel!&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;Go, Go Israel!&quot;. It might not be up there with You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone but maybe Baddiel, Skinner and that bloke out of the Lightning Seeds could do something with it. Failing that, simply repeat several hundred times in a loud voice or until the man from next door comes round to complain. Eat the right food  Your typical Israeli terrace snack tends to be felafel (deep fried pureed chickpea ball) wrapped in pitta bread with tahini. Goes well with salad, yoghurt, sour grapes and the bitter taste of eventual elimination from Europe&apos;s greatest football beano. Wash down with a Maccabee beer and then round things off with a Noblesse, the classic Israeli cigarette. Have a half-time cup of tea  Never mind the PG Tips. You&apos;re best off with a traditional mint tea or a cup of thick, grainy &apos;botz&apos; coffee. From the look of the way the home team shaped up in England&apos;s 0-0 in Tel Aviv, you might need more than one of these as the game progresses. Run with the Green Apes  Warning: one for the hardcore casual fan only. The Green Apes is the collective name for the ultras of the Maccabi Haifa support, a Mediterranean Israeli resort equivalent of the Chelsea Headhunters. All you need is a green T-shirt, a grudge against the big city hegemony and the lyrics to the song &quot;Everybody Jump&quot; (which also involves everybody jumping). As the Green Apes&apos; website points out: &quot;With our unstoppable cheer and our support we can bring the team to success.&quot; That includes you too. Offer them a free David Beckham  Beckham may be as English as warm beer, roast beef and swanking around in Los Angeles modelling underpants but he doesn&apos;t have to stay that way. Anybody with a single Jewish grandparent has the right to Israeli citizenship, something Dave qualifies for through his dad. Sounds like a decent way to kill two birds with one stone: they get the kudos of hosting brand Beckhams&apos; quest for world domination. And we don&apos;t have to have the kudos of hosting brand Beckhams&apos; quest for world domination any more. Do it for us, Becks. Back an Argentinian  Most likely to stick one in the Russian net: Roberto Colautti, an Argentinian-born striker who has scored six goals in eight games for the Israelis, including two in a 4-3 defeat by Croatia last November.

Victory in Tel Aviv for the visiting Russians and England will be knocked out of the tournament in disappointment and humiliation; success for Israel and England will still be knocked out of the tournament in disappointment and humiliation, but not until next June. Unaccustomed as you no doubt are to being an Israel supporter, you may need some detailed instructions to help you on your way - so here is a handy print-out-and-keep guide: Refreshments You won&apos;t be needing beer (let&apos;s call it an optional extra), crisps, king-size Mars bars or a burger cooked in a hazardous trailer parked in a garage forecourt on the way to the ground. You do however need sunflower seeds, in their shells. In Israel they are called garinim. Eating them can be a tricky business, but follow these simple steps and you should be all right: 1) Hold the seed so that the edges face up and down 2) Insert into the mouth and nibble with your front teeth, splitting the shell 3) Still holding the shell, use your tongue to extract the seed 4) Eat the seed, and drop the shell on the floor 5) Repeat 6) At the end of the game, leave a large pile of shells on the floor for somebody else to clean up. Alternative match-time eating includes pitta bread filled with (kosher) salami or cold omelette and salad (just close your eyes and think of chicken balti pies and you&apos;ll be fine). With cans and bottles banned from grounds, fans are forced to buy paper cups of fizzy drinks or to sneak in those pouches of vaguely orange-tasting stuff you pierce with a straw before drinking. If you must drink beer, consider tracking down one of the big Israeli brands, Goldstar or Maccabi. What to wear No expensive outlay required: replica kits haven&apos;t really taken off in the Holy Land, but a light blue T-shirt would help you look the part. The anthem The first verse of Ha&apos;Tikva (the hope) will be sung before kick-off. Up in the stands, the fans will sing it slightly faster than whichever washed-up Israeli pop star is holding the microphone, and in the resulting musical confusion a little hopeful humming is unlikely to be noticed. The whole thing is supposed to sound something like this, but if you&apos;re actually at the ground it&apos;s actually more like this. If absolute authenticity is your goal you&apos;re going to need the lyrics, helpfully transliterated into an alphabet you, and your computer, might be able to cope with: Kol od balevav p&apos;nimah Nefesh Yehudi homiyah Ulfa&apos;atey mizrach kadimah Ayin l&apos;tzion tzofiyah Hatikvah bat shnot alpayim L&apos;hiyot am chofshi b&apos;artzenu Eretz Tzion v&apos;Yerushalayim You may find humming a little easier. Chants Local fans have settled on just two handily brief and simple chants. There&apos;s nothing to stop you getting stuck into these at home: El El Yisrael - Upwards, upwards Israel! Yisrael, Milchama - Israel, war! You may also hear these ones: Someone&apos;s Name Ben-zona - Whoever it is is a son of a bitch Russiya zona, Russiya zona, Russiya motzetzet le&apos;kol ha&apos;shchunah - Russia is a whore, Russia is a whore, Russia sucks off the whole neighbourhood (they&apos;re a subtle bunch, those Israelis) Who to cheer Somewhat more problematic, but Israeli - and with it English - hopes are largely in the hands of two individuals. The goalkeeper Dudu Aouate (local media spell it Awat, presumably because it&apos;s pronounced the same but is a lot easier to spell) plays for Deportivo La Coruna and is very good indeed, and the Argentina-born striker Roberto Colautti has got seven goals in six qualifying games, but is only just back from injury.

They enabled him to survive the perils of a peculiarly perilous life to die in his bed in his 65th year, but they did not bring him serenity or fulfilment. Never was an autobiography more aptly titled than Hussein&apos;s Uneasy Lies the Head. Unease is the inescapable leitmotif, too, of this remarkable new book. Its major theme is Hussein&apos;s lifelong quest for a peace settlement between the Arabs and the Israelis of the Middle East, but this enlightened purpose was entangled with hidden intentions and cross-purposes. Hussein was inspired always by loyalty to his family, the Hashemite descendants of the Prophet himself, and in his mind the Arab cause was synonymous with the idea of a united Araby under the aegis of his own grand pedigree. Of course this antagonised those many Arabs who felt no loyalty to the Hashemites at all, and certainly did not recognise their suzerainty. This meant that all too often his struggle for a just peace was a lonely one, and his negotiations with the Israelis were necessarily covert. Nobody could be better qualified to pursue this murky trail than Avi Shlaim, a distinguished Israeli historian of generous sympathies and Oxford connections, who has worried his way through subterfuge and mendacity, terrorist threat and open warfare, to establish Hussein&apos;s credentials as a genuine champion of peace. The young Hussein&apos;s first encounter with the vicious fury of the Arab-Israeli struggle occurred in 1951 when his beloved grandfather Abdullah, the first king of Jordan, was murdered at his side by an Arab militant as they entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The assassin believed the old monarch to be in cahoots with the Israelis, and it says a lot for Hussein&apos;s courage that during his own reign he had more than 40 clandestine meetings with Israeli leaders in his efforts to conclude a peace - often in London at the home of his Jewish doctor there, sometimes in a frontier tent, or on board a boat in the Gulf of Aqaba. And it says much for his charm that the meetings nearly always ended, if not in political agreement, at least in social goodwill. But while this protracted peace initiative provides the true theme of his book, Shlaim does not shirk the squalors and dangers that always attended the royal progress. Successive Arab-Israeli wars are analysed in detail, with terrorist outrages on both sides, disputes regarding frontiers, or water supplies, or the Holy Places of Jerusalem and the tragic mass of Palestinian refugees who swarmed into Jordan. The ambiguous growth of Palestinian ambitions; the fluctuating loyalties of the Jordanian army; incessant domestic corruptions and political rivalries; the Iran-Iraq war; the emergence of Saddam Hussein; the brooding threats of the cold war - all is happening in the pages of this book, as the brave and courteous little king pursues his dynastic intentions. Nor are his weaknesses disregarded. He could be indecisive. He was said to be not above corruption himself. He totally misjudged Saddam, at the temporary cost of friendship with America. He never quite outgrew his playboy youth (he divorced two of his four wives), his love of fast cars and aircraft - when in 1975 he flew his own helicopter to welcome Henry Kissinger to Jordan, Kissinger said the royal aerobatics were so alarming that he would have signed any document as the price of getting Hussein back to earth. But still, as Churchill said of his own political progress, Hussein &quot;buggered on&quot;. His truest Israeli friend, Itzhak Rabin, was assassinated by an Israeli zealot in 1995, ironically at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. Hussein&apos;s relations with his neighbouring Arab rulers were seldom straightforward. He depended variously and precariously, for arms as for finance, upon the British, the Americans, the Saudis and the Gulf states. He could never be sure, the Israeli democracy being what it was, that the enemy government he dealt with one year would still be in power the next, and his relations with his own politicians were snarled up in rivalries and delusions. Uneasy lay the head ... Shlaim tells this singular story in great detail. He starts with the first emergence of the Hashemites from their desert kingdom, under the impulse of the Arab revolt against the Turks in the first world war. He ends with the death of Hussein, cruelly debilitated by cancer, in the presence of all his family at Amman in 1999. It is an exhausting tale, but Shlaim tells it, for all its complicated scholarship and historical allusion, with genuine compassion. Hussein died much loved and widely admired, not least for his courtesy, and his memorial service in St Paul&apos;s Cathedral was the first time the Koran had ever been read in that temple of the Christians. The story, though, has no happy ending. Hussein thought that when, in 1994, a peace treaty was at last signed between Jordan and Israel, it was the true beginning of a general peace process. His task was done, he thought, the task he had inherited from Abdullah and the long line of his forebears. He said it was the happiest day of his life. It was not to be. A general peace between Arabs and Israelis is still no more than a dream. Jordan is the last fief of the Hashemites and when, in 1997, operatives of Mossad openly tried to assassinate a Jordanian citizen in the streets of its capital Amman, Hussein said he felt as though somebody had &quot;spat in his face&quot;. It was history spitting at him, with its insomniac sneer.  \u00b7 Jan Morris&apos;s Hav is published by Faber", "publicationDate": "2007-11-17T23:56:48Z", "title": "Review: Lion of Jordan by Avi Shlaim", "sentences": ["His truest Israeli friend, Itzhak Rabin, was assassinated by an Israeli zealot in 1995, ironically at a peace rally in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview12"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "article": "And so it came to pass that Ingerland fans were dependant on the sons of Israel in order to reach the Promised Land, which is a bit of a stretch in many ways, not least because, if Austria-Switzerland is as good as travel gets, then there is a strong case for staying at home. This was an arguably demeaning predicament, but at least it was a novel one. And it allowed The Sun to put some new life into old jokes. Not least on its front page: &apos;Yeltsin, Gagarin, Lenin, Polonium, Ivan The Terrible, Tolstoy, Gorbachev, Ra-ra-Rasputin, Sharapova, Tchaikovsky, Abramovich. Israel will give your boys a hell of a beating.&apos; The inclusion of a chemical element associated with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko between a couple of old politicos was a stroke of near genius. The jokes continued in a leader headlined &apos;Come on Israel&apos; in which the paper exhorted everyone to cheer on &apos;the Middle East minnows&apos;. And in the centre pages they kindly inserted a cut-out-and-keep Star of David flag &apos;to wave in front of the telly&apos;. All fun and games, but the television wing of the operation were more concerned with darker arts. &apos;Should we believe in conspiracy theories?&apos; asked Richard Keys with a gravitas more becoming the definitive programme on the Kennedy assassination than a Euro qualifier. Such talk flew over the heads of Glenn Hoddle and Trevor Francis, neither of whom would convince as colleagues of George Smiley. They just wanted to establish their Zionist credentials. &apos;I say &quot;we&quot; because we&apos;re supporting Israel, of course,&apos; said Trevor Francis. &apos;Good man,&apos; said Glenn Hoddle before going on to talk about &apos;we&apos; &apos;having a problem away from home&apos;. But weren&apos;t Israel at home? How many first-person plurals can one have in one lifetime? Over in the stadium, Rob Hawthorne was worried that there were &apos;plenty of empty seats. And most of those that are occupied appear to be occupied by Russian supporters.&apos; He was obviously, and perhaps blissfully, unaware that millions of supporters of &apos;the Middle East minnows&apos; were in Britain and waving Star of David flags in front of the telly. Hawthorne, meanwhile, was seated next to a less starry David. &apos;I think he should have pulled the trigger there,&apos; said Platt after Elyaniv Barda had fannied about around the grassy penalty spot. A minute later it was irrelevant as Israel scored. &apos;The dream start. It&apos;s Barda,&apos; said Hawthorne. &apos;What a start for England,&apos; said Platt. That&apos;s the trouble with conspiracy theories in today&apos;s 24/7 globalised culture: they have a very short shelf life. And if it were to be a conspiracy, it was going to have to be an extraordinarily subtle and sinuous one. Platt, however, remained suspicious, criticising Ben Sahar for &apos;electing to pull the trigger too early&apos;. You can see why Sky paid good money to fly Platt from Vienna to Tel Aviv. When the theme of your night is conspiracy a pundit whose catchphrase is &apos;pulling the trigger&apos; is an obvious choice. Russia, meanwhile, were looking limpid. Could the conspiracy theorists have been looking in the wrong direction? What if JT, Lamps and the Coley had put some heat on The Roman? What if Abramovich had responded to that deep heat? What if he had put club before country? A lot of &apos;what ifs&apos;, admittedly, but Glenn and Trevor declined the bait. And then Russia equalised and there was talk of &apos;the increasing Russian threat&apos; and what destructive weapons they might launch in the next 30, not even 45, minutes. The threat proved illusory. Although it was close. &apos;He&apos;s hit the post, the post saves England,&apos; said Hawthorne. Before exulting &apos;Golan it is, who has hit the heights&apos;.

Israel delivered a massive favour by beating Russia 2-1 in Tel Aviv to leave England still alive in Group E as they go into their final game against Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday, answering all McClaren&apos;s prayers at once. &apos;Once things are out of your hands, you are in a vacuum, and that&apos;s not a good place to be,&apos; he said. &apos;Any football manager&apos;s job is 24/7, but this has been a difficult week. I&apos;ve been waking up thinking about it and going to bed thinking about it. It&apos;s been a long wait and I&apos;ve been anxious to get it over. I always said this group would not be over until it&apos;s over, people were jumping the gun in predicting the result from Israel but I know how difficult it is to go away from home and come back with a result.&apos; What England need to do now is remember McClaren&apos;s words about nothing being over until it&apos;s over. They have been granted a reprieve, but still must avoid defeat against Croatia in what should be the best atmosphere yet in the new Wembley. However, with Croatia now through thanks to Russia&apos;s failure tonight, McClaren will hope they lack the desire his own side must show if they are to make the most of such an unexpected reprieve. Omer Golan&apos;s stoppage-time winner in Tel Aviv, just seconds after Dmitri Sychev had struck a post with a shot which looked destined to send England out, must have raised the roof not only off the Ramat Gan Stadium but the Grove Hotel in Watford, where McClaren was watching on, accompanied by his coaching staff. McClaren must have been shredding his fingernails as, for 29 long minutes, Israel resisted their increasingly desperate visitors after Diniyar Biyaletdinov had levelled Elianiv Barda&apos;s early effort. Yet it appeared all the hard work would be wasted when Sychev broke through. Amazingly, the Russian&apos;s seemingly goalbound shot bounced off the outside of the Israeli post and, as they poured forward looking for a winner, Guus Hiddink&apos;s side were caught with the perfect sucker punch as Golan scored the goal that could mean so much to McClaren. Russia seemed disabled by nerves when the home side took the lead, unable to stem the flow of Israeli attacks. It would have been no surprise and in no way unjust had the hosts doubled their lead, although the closest they came was when Barak Itzhaki and Barda failed by inches to convert Maor Bar Bazaglo&apos;s outswinging free-kick to the far post. But, as soon as the second half began, it was obvious Hiddink had prompted a revolution in belief. Suddenly, it was Russia on top and creating all the chances. Although Dudu Aouate stood firm for a while, it was only a matter of time before the visitors levelled. The equaliser was a fine example of team play, with four men involved on the edge of the area before Andrei Arshavin rolled a pass into the path of Biyaletdinov which invited the finish. Israel were now on the retreat and McClaren must have had his head in his hands as he watched Sychev flash a 20-yard shot just wide. Another shot from Sychev followed, along with yet more Russian pressure. Indeed, throughout the final half-hour, Israel mustered just one chance, with Gal Alberman&apos;s flick just off target. But, in a gut-wrenching finale, Sychev came so close to knocking England out before Golan finally managed, implausibly, to finish Russia off. England typically had managed to make life more difficult for themselves by losing Michael Owen - a thigh injury will keep him on the sidelines for a month - in Friday&apos;s ill advised and not really necessary friendly in Austria, which they won 1-0. With Wayne Rooney and Emile Heskey already injured that leaves McClaren with a striking problem for Wednesday. Peter Crouch, scorer of the only goal in Vienna is certain to play: the big question is who plays alongside him, if anyone. The only other fit striker in the squad is Jermaine Defoe. McClaren does not seem to have much more faith in him than the Tottenham player&apos;s two club managers this season and may feel the little and large partnership is somewhat lightweight. He has the option of playing Crouch alone up front, which would perhaps be too conservative, so he may compromise, as he has done before, by giving Steven Gerrard a free role and asking him to play ahead of midfield as a second striker to his clubmate. That would allow him to field a better balanced midfield than he did in Austria, with Gareth Barry or Owen Hargreaves able to come in to play alongside Frank Lampard in the middle. Even without Owen, McClaren will feel a weight has been lifted from his shoulders at Wembley. The crowd will be optimistic and supportive whereas until Israel&apos;s surprise win, watched by Chelsea&apos;s Russian owner Roman Abramovich, the mood had threatened to be hostile. Whatever the Football Association&apos;s private reservations about England&apos;s qualifying campaign McClaren&apos;s employers will be able to support him to the end, and perhaps even the European Championship in next summer. None of this was foreseeable in Austria on Friday, when McClaren was even asked whether he would tender his resignation in advance to avoid leading out a hopeless team in a dead match. He said he would decide nothing until the results from Israel and Macedonia came in, and events have proved him right. So if the Croatia game really does take care of itself - as McClaren and some of his players have already been rashly predicting - the manager should be set fair until summer at least, when England&apos;s performances in Austria and Switzerland will determined his future. No one who has followed England for the last 16 months is going to run away with the idea that one result on a foreign field suddenly transforms McClaren into an ideal manager or the right man for the job, though it is not as if there are many other outstanding candidates waiting in the wings. Martin O&apos;Neill, the Aston Villa manager, might be an improvement but he is not English, while the stock of all the other candidates interviewed last year has slumped in the past 12 months. The appetite for a foreign coach has also shrunk noticeably in the same period, not least because there are now so many foreign players and managers in the Premier League. The feeling is growing that because of the increasingly international nature of the Premier League the England team and everything around it needs to be kept English. The debate has moved on since Sven-Goran Eriksson was courted in 2000, or even since Luis Felipe Scolari and Hiddink were sounded out last year. Now people are saying the commercial success of the Premier League is entirely due to foreigners and that England only hosts the competition in the same way Germany hosted the last World Cup. Simultaneously, the England manager has been complaining that barely three dozen English players perform regularly in the Premier League and way too many of those are centre-halfs. When your domestic league is essentially an imported success, your national side becomes your only source of national pride. There is probably truth in the suggestion too that the Football Association&apos;s international committee do not fancy going through the whole process of selecting a new manager all over again, so soon after the last time. They too have been spared a difficult decision by that winning goal in Tel Aviv. Perhaps McClaren&apos;s stroke of luck should not be such a surprise, though. He has been cursed by injuries to almost all his key players, he saw a refereeing decision go the wrong way and cost England in Russia and when he went to Austria to fine-tune his players for the Croatia game he came back without his key striker. Some would say McClaren was lucky just to have the job in the first place. He was simply a compromise choice, not strongly preferred by anyone but not actively disliked either. Crucially, however, what the FA overlooked in opting for continuity with a coach who had worked as Eriksson&apos;s assistant, was that McClaren had not achieved all that much as a manager in his own right. His record of one Carling Cup win and one Uefa Cup final was as good as any other of the home-based candidates, though there were plenty who suggested he could have done rather better with the money and the players Steve Gibson had made available at Middlesbrough. Unlike some of the other contenders last year, McClaren specifically did not have a reputation for getting the best from a small, restricted group of players. Like it or not, that is what the England job now boils down to. They might be very good players - at least they look it in the Premier League - but there are not very many of them, certain positions are much better covered than others, and the best ones keep getting injured. There should be no more talk of golden generations or world-class individuals until the players do more on the pitch to justify their manager&apos;s high opinion of them. The fans who watch their games are more realistic about what to expect. If England make the European Championship they will be lucky to be there. Start by acknowledging that bottom line truth and McClaren and his players might be able to build on their outrageous fortune. &apos;We&apos;ve had some bad luck, to say the least, but I don&apos;t want to make excuses, we had enough games,&apos; McClaren said. &apos;We all share the responsibility but, as the manager, the buck stops with me. I accept that. Ultimately it&apos;s my job, and in this job you live and die by the players, you live and die by results.&apos; Almost unbelievably, England are still in the land of the living.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-18T21:31:18Z", "title": "Football: How lucky can you get", "sentences": ["Israel delivered a massive favour by beating Russia 2-1 in Tel Aviv to leave England still alive in Group E as they go into their final game against Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday, answering all McClaren&apos;s prayers at once.", "Omer Golan&apos;s stoppage-time winner in Tel Aviv, just seconds after Dmitri Sychev had struck a post with a shot which looked destined to send England out, must have raised the roof not only off the Ramat Gan Stadium but the Grove Hotel in Watford, where McClaren was watching on, accompanied by his coaching staff.", "They too have been spared a difficult decision by that winning goal in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/18/sport.comment1"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Steven Gerrard"], "article": "Steven Gerrard said last night that England were gearing up for &quot;the game of our lives&quot; as they seek to confirm passage to next summer&apos;s European Championship in Austria and Switzerland by avoiding defeat by Croatia on Wednesday.

Croatia are through to Austria and Switzerland but jubilation is tinged with frustration after the loss of their unbeaten qualifying record in the rain and mud of Macedonia on Saturday evening. Kranjcar insists that the team who reached the World Cup semi-finals nine years ago want to show they can be contenders again next summer. &quot;We want to prove how good we really are,&quot; said the midfielder. &quot;We know the pitch on Wednesday will be brilliant and it will suit the way we play. This is our opportunity to take on a big nation like England at a great arena like Wembley and let the world see they can count on us to play well at the Euros. We want to send a message. We will get respect if we do that.&quot; That desire for respect has been boosted by Israel&apos;s surprise 2-1 victory against Russia in Tel Aviv. Kranjcar admits he did not expect the home side to put up a strong fight against Guus Hiddink&apos;s team but the fact that they did so - and as a consequence cleared Croatia&apos;s path to Euro 2008 - has set a standard. &quot;Israel gave their maximum even though they had no chance of qualifying for the Euros so we must now give our maximum against England also,&quot; he said. &quot;We have an obligation to do so.&quot; The promise of being on the front foot against England is partly based on the belief within the Croatian camp that they will be penned into their own half on Wednesday if they do not attack. Kranjcar, a regular at Premier League Portsmouth, says he has told his team-mates that England are a side unable to play for a draw even though that outcome would ensure Steve McClaren&apos;s men also qualify for the European Championship. &quot;England showed in their match in Moscow [the 2-1 defeat to Russia] that they cannot be satisfied with a draw,&quot; Kranjcar said. &quot;They were at 1-1, which would have been OK, but still went for a second goal. They kept attacking. &quot;It will be an interesting game on Wednesday. We will play how we did against England in Zagreb when we won 2-0 and try to dominate possession. We always feel more comfortable when we have the ball than when we do not. That&apos;s our style.&quot; Kranjcar admits that when the qualifying groups were chosen he expected the national side of the country where he plays rather than the one where he was born to dominate proceedings. &quot;I&apos;m surprised by the way England have performed so far. I expected them to do better,&quot; the 23-year-old said. &quot;England definitely have the squad to do better. &quot;Their players have proven that week in, week out in the Premier League and in the Champions League. They are a top, top side.&quot; Croatia had to wade through ever-deepening mud on Saturday evening, searching for a football which refused to be found at times and, when it did appear, was reluctant to move. &quot;The worst pitch I have ever played on,&quot; Kranjcar said after his side&apos;s 2-0 defeat. Macedonia&apos;s goals came from Goran Maznov and Ilco Naumoski but their best performer was Vlade Lazarevski, whose powerful runs down the waterlogged right flank had the beating of Croatia&apos;s left-back Josip Simunic time and again.

Hardly. No England head coach facing the defining match of his career without more than half of his first-choice team - Neville, Ferdinand, Terry, Rooney, Owen and Heskey - can be called that. But the results elsewhere on Saturday night made McClaren appear fortunate by granting him a glimpse of the one thing he looked as though he was going to be denied: the chance to make a fresh start. On Wednesday night the fans will be supporting the players. With qualification for the Euro 2008 finals now a distinct possibility, they are unlikely to waste their breath abusing the man whose mistakes put that ambition in such obvious jeopardy. Only if things go badly wrong will Wembley hear the sort of derisive abuse aimed squarely at McClaren when his team performed so poorly against Israel in Tel Aviv and Andorra in Barcelona. Should England secure their passage to next summer&apos;s tournament by gaining at least a draw against Croatia, the head coach will be included in the applause, albeit in a probationary sort of way. Even in their hour of unexpected joy the supporters would be unable to forget that he has spent much of the past year showing himself to be unequal to the task of international management. Even the memory of that run of five 3-0 wins in qualifying matches was swept away by 10 minutes of defensive mismanagement against Russia in Moscow. With qualification, however, would come his chance to overturn posterity&apos;s verdict. Reprieved from the prospect of being removed from the job by a group of Football Association committee men who will be happy not to be discussing the prospect of a large pay-off, he has the opportunity to show us that this year&apos;s McClaren was merely a Mark 1 prototype and that Mark 2 will demonstrate the benefit of all the lessons learnt in a first year of trial and error. This will be no easy task and so far he has done little to suggest that he is capable of making the transformation. But Don Howe and other experienced judges, using the early travails of Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson as evidence, are convinced that it takes time to learn the job of international management. McClaren, they believe, can only have benefited from his experiences and to cast him aside in favour of a Martin O&apos;Neill or a Sam Allardyce would be to start from scratch once again, with no guarantee of improvement. If England qualify, McClaren will no doubt remain at his post at least until the end of next summer&apos;s matches. It would be wise of the FA to announce its intention of taking a month after that tournament to assess its outcome and England&apos;s performance before deciding whether to exercise the two-year option which, prudently, was built into the Yorkshireman&apos;s contract. At this point it would probably help McClaren&apos;s cause if the Republic of Ireland were to succeed in their rumoured aim of taking Terry Venables off his hands. Imprisoned for too long by a gruesomely transparent desire to be seen to be doing and saying the right thing, McClaren needs to back his own instincts, to say what he really believes and to let people know that the switched-on smile and the shopworn soundbites have been hiding the thoughts of a real football man. Then we might see a glimmer of the originality that any successful international coach needs to bring to bear on his available resources. The real question will be whether Euro 2008 represents a final opportunity for the generation of David Beckham, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard to fulfil their long-advertised promise or whether qualification itself would represent an opportunity to make the transition to a new group of players that McClaren himself appeared to promise in his opening address to the nation in August 2006. To put it bluntly, are the members of the &quot;golden generation&quot; too old or too stale for the job? Were he able to pick all those players currently absent through injury or suspension, the average age of his starting line-up would be just under 28. For an international side, that sounds about right - although Italy, the reigning world champions, took the field at Hampden Park on Saturday with a team averaging just the wrong side of 30, and no player younger than 26. But the possibility of a fresh start, and the example of Micah Richards&apos;s successful emergence this year, should encourage McClaren to look ahead. Owen&apos;s latest injury was a sign that the striker, like others in the squad, will not be getting any fitter as he gets older. The head coach might consider it time to thank Beckham for coming to his aid at a time of crisis while making it clear that he is not a part of England&apos;s long-term planning, which must incorporate new thinking. After McClaren and his players watched Israel beat Russia on Saturday night, did they stay tuned for Argentina&apos;s 3-0 win over Bolivia in a South American qualifying match for the next World Cup? If so they will have seen a better way to play, one from which it is not too late to extract important lessons. Alfio Basile, Argentina&apos;s head coach, put two holding midfield players, Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Mascherano, in front of his back four, with Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme in the playmaker&apos;s role behind a front three of Lionel Messi on the right, Carlos Tevez on the left and the 19-year-old Sergio &quot;Kun&quot; Ag\u00fcero, the replacement for Fernando Torres at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, in the middle. Ag\u00fcero scored on his senior competitive debut, the wonderful right foot of Riquelme supplied the other goals and the contrast between McClaren&apos;s 4-4-2 in Vienna on Friday and Basile&apos;s 4-2-1-3 in Buenos Aires 24 hours later was the difference between a typewriter and a laptop. McClaren himself mentioned the possibility of reacting to Owen&apos;s absence by calling up Theo Walcott, the outstanding performer in England&apos;s under-21 victory over Bulgaria, while Gabriel Agbonlahor, another member of that team, is also knocking on the door of the senior squad. Given the stodgy performance of the reunited midfield quartet in Vienna, the continued inability of Jermain Defoe to establish himself and the distinctly promising second-half debut of Ashley Young, an alternative pattern could be allowed to emerge: Gareth Barry and Owen Hargreaves as the holding partnership, Frank Lampard as the playmaker, and an interchanging front three of Walcott, Agbonlahor and Young. With a bench, that it is to say, including Gerrard, Joe Cole, Peter Crouch and possibly Beckham. For an expression of that kind of faith in youth, pace and skill to match Basile&apos;s, however, we might have to wait until after Wednesday, or even after next summer.

When Omer Golan scored the winner against Russia, giving England a lifeline in Euro 2008 and manager Steve McClaren a lifeline in his job, Golan&apos;s father Yaacov had extra reason to celebrate - not only had he seen his son clinch the winner in Tel Aviv, he could also look forward to taking delivery of a new Mercedes. British bookie Fred Done had offered the \u00a350,000 car as a bonus to whichever Israeli player scored a winner against Russia, thereby meaning England need only draw against Croatia at Wembley this week to qualify for the tournament. But before Golan Sr could get his hands on the ignition keys, the Israeli Football Association ruled that the 25-year-old would not be allowed to accept the gift, branding it an inappropriate bonus. Golan&apos;s father drives a Suzuki jeep. &quot;The car was just a bonus,&quot; his son said yesterday. &quot;A Mercedes would have been a nice present for my father. But the main thing was to score after four years in the national team and to win the game. I hope it will help me to move to England. It&apos;s funny to find out I have became a national hero over there.&quot; Golan recently trained with west London Championship side Queens Park Rangers. In a seven-year career playing for Maccabi Petah Tikva at the unfashionable end of the Israeli first division, he has never scored a more significant goal than Saturday&apos;s injury-time winner. Had Russia beaten Israel, England&apos;s chances of qualifying for the finals of Euro 2008 would have ended, leaving McClaren out of his \u00a32.5m-a-year job and free to start circulating his CV to club chairmen. While McClaren contemplates his unlikely redemption, Golan is hopeful that the winner against Russia will revive a career that had stalled. The goal was his first for his country for four years, and earlier this year a theory was circulating that his international career owed more to his connections than his talent. His club chairman, Avi Luzon, is also chairman of the Israeli FA, and conspiracists suggested the chairman wanted Golan to receive enough international caps to make him eligible for a work permit in Europe and, thus, a lucrative transfer. &quot;When they said I was playing in Israel&apos;s colours just because of Avi Luzon, it hurt me,&quot; Golan said. &quot;Avi Luzon supported me my whole career and I&apos;m grateful, but I&apos;m in the national team for my merits.&quot; A hard-working player who is planning to marry his childhood sweetheart next May, Golan&apos;s previous career high was a hat-trick two years ago against Partizan Belgrade in the Uefa Cup. Now his agent is eyeing up opportunities in England. &quot;That&apos;s his dream ever since he started playing football when he was six,&quot; said Golan&apos;s father. &quot;He is going to be the next big thing in English football. Yesterday he played for the nation and for the team, and not for the car, but the real bonus would be a chance to play in England.

The policy was agreed by the FA because of Owen&apos;s nine-month absence after rupturing knee ligaments at last year&apos;s World Cup and spiralling Premier League wages.

Sir Alex Ferguson will wait until Thursday before deciding whether to force Nemanja Vidic to pull out of Serbia&apos;s final Euro 2008 qualifier to play in Manchester United&apos;s game at Bolton Wanderers. Vidic is in danger of missing the match because Serbia&apos;s game against Kazakhstan, scheduled for last Saturday, was postponed by a week due to heavy snow in Belgrade. Uefa confirmed yesterday that United have the power to recall the defender because it is not an international weekend. However, Ferguson intends to wait until after tomorrow&apos;s qualifiers, when Portugal can confirm their place in next summer&apos;s tournament - and eliminate Serbia - by drawing at home to Finland. In that event Vidic would return to play at Bolton. The dilemma for Ferguson is if Portugal leave the door open for Serbs to qualify.

By the time revolution came, it was too late for Kentridge to be anything other than an artist, actor, film-maker, playwright, puppeteer, theatre and opera director. Born in 1955, he is arguably South Africa&apos;s best-known artist. The painter Marlene Dumas, two years older than Kentridge, has as large a reputation, but has worked in the Netherlands since 1975 and is only now having her first exhibition in Cape Town, which opened a week ago. Kentridge has lately turned to opera: his 2004 production of Mozart&apos;s The Magic Flute has toured to Brussels, Lille, Naples, Tel Aviv and New York, and he is currently working on a production of Dmitri Shostakovich&apos;s 1927 opera The Nose (based on a short story by Gogol) for New York&apos;s Metropolitan Opera. But essentially, Kentridge remains a draughtsman and a storyteller. He is best known for his charcoal animations, for which he would draw, erase and redraw successive images on the same sheet of paper, photographing the process as he went. His most famous series of these, the Soho Eckstein films, follow the life and crimes of a white South African industrialist through the last years of apartheid and into the new democratic era. In the last Eckstein film, Tide Table (2003), the fat, ageing magnate expires in his deckchair on a beach while the world goes on around him. Writing in the Village Voice, Barbara Pollack compared the Eckstein films - none more than nine or 10 minutes long - with The Sopranos. The story seems as vast as a continent, but largely consists of what Kentridge leaves out, what is intimated but unseen; you have to make it up yourself. What is magical is how much Kentridge does with an animation technique that he has himself described as stone-age. Which is probably why Kentridge&apos;s animations are as good as they are. His art has an affecting, hand-made, do-it-yourself quality that is matched by a natural storytelling ability and a critical intellect. If his adoption of stop-motion animation and his almost expressionist, graphic use of charcoal appear old-fashioned, they are purposefully so. The more one looks, the more references pile in. The University of Brighton has now mounted a show of Kentridge&apos;s recent work, including much that has never before been seen in the UK. It is the largest British exhibition of the artist since an international touring show came to London&apos;s Serpentine Gallery in 1999. The most impressive work here is a group of 2003 films based on the cinematographer (and one-time stage magician) Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, whose 1902 Voyage Dans la Lune remains one of the best-known early films. Whose childhood has not been haunted by M\u00e9li\u00e8s&apos; bullet-like space rocket landing in the man in the moon&apos;s eye? Kentridge&apos;s own Journey to the Moon and his Seven Fragments for Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s return us not only to the clunky, experimental days of early cinema, and to a sense of childhood wonder, but also to the artist&apos;s studio. Kentridge realised that M\u00e9li\u00e8s&apos; films were as studio-bound as any artist&apos;s work. Drawing together ideas from M\u00e9li\u00e8s&apos;s film-making, the studio life of Jackson Pollock, and the studio films of Bruce Nauman, and combining them with Kentridge&apos;s own solitary working experiences, he created a work about &quot;wandering around the studio waiting for something to happen&quot;. These seven short, looped vignettes are never boring. They mix live action with animation; Kentridge gives himself a charcoal-and-chalk doppelganger who looks back at his creator with a wary eye. It is difficult not to see these fragments as a single story, an attempt to take flight by the power of imagination alone. In this way, Kentridge echoes not just Nauman or Pollock but also Ilya Kabakov&apos;s drawings and installation about escaping his Moscow flat during the Soviet era in a homemade spaceship. Kentridge goes to the moon, or imagines he does, with a stove-top coffee-pot for his space capsule, an expresso cup screwed to his eye for a telescope. It is a world, then, of the everyday, of make-believe and of play. Running film backwards as well as forwards, doing and undoing his actions (the same way he draws), even performing backwards as Chaplin did in some of his early silents, Kentridge gives his actions an unearthly strangeness. At times he moves about with the slowness of a man walking on the sea bed. There are lots of tricks in these little films, but we know all of them. Or most of them: on one screen, there is a sort of Brownian motion of little white dots against a black background. At first, I think it is a film of busy microbes under a microscope, then of fields of restless stars in a jangling universe seen through a telescope. In fact, they&apos;re ants - projected in negative, purposefully seeking out then following an invisible trail of sugar with which Kentridge has coaxed the insects to draw straight lines, curves, a human being. (He even tried to &quot;teach&quot; the ants calligraphy.) One thinks of Bruce Nauman&apos;s video installation Mapping the Studio, an idea that sprung from an infestation of mice in his studio. Kentridge uses the summer invasion of ants, turning them into constellations and star fields. But while the studio can be a magical place, it can also be where an artist comes up against his or her own limitations. Kentridge said making his own Journey to the Moon was an attempt to escape. All these films are visible, after dusk and throughout the night, on Brighton&apos;s Grand Parade, being projected on the full-length windows of the arts faculty of the University of Brighton. Entertaining though this is from the street, I don&apos;t think it is the best way of watching these films. From inside the gallery, they appear back to front. This is annoying. The rest of the gallery spaces are used to display Kentridge&apos;s prints, which always strike me as secondary to his drawings and animations, even when he makes stereoscopic images that lurch into three dimensions when we look at them with the aid of a small viewing apparatus. More interesting by far is Kentridge&apos;s new work, being shown along the seafront in a ramshackle, partially restored Regency terrace house in Hove. In a darkened room, a film doesn&apos;t so much unfold as revolve in a spot-lit circle on a tabletop. The atmosphere is rather like attending a particularly raucous seance. Distorted, uglified forms turn about the circle of light, orbiting a static, shiny metal cylinder. Reflections of Kentridge&apos;s images are reflected in the curved surface of the cylinder, where they assume their natural shape. The weirdly extruded charcoal forms reveal themselves as African villages, a tree, a vast landscape, a bird, a great fat fly, a rhinoceros, a gun. A story is being told, both in images and in sound. Martial music blares, an Italian tenor croons, voices fade in and out, a gas mask looms in the mirror, there is a murder. Suddenly everything is blown apart, in a virtual explosion of smudged charcoal and bruised paper. This 35-mm film from 2006, titled What Will Come (Has Already Come), ultimately takes as its subject the 1936-7 annexation of Ethiopia by Mussolini&apos;s troops, and the later exodus of Ethiopian Jews to Israel during the famine of 1984-5. In almost all of Kentridge&apos;s animated films, as soon as we recognise an image, it is replaced by another, in a tide of erased and redrawn charcoal. Kentridge lays waste to his images in order for them to tell their story. His use of anamorphic images - rather like the phantom skull in Holbein&apos;s The Ambassadors, that weird extruded shape that only reveals itself for what it is if we stand in a particular relationship to the painting - is meant to alert us to the fact that how we see things, and interpret events, depends on where we stand. Our judgments do not escape history. But Kentridge&apos;s filmic anamorphosis is also great fun. It is mesmerising, even though its subject is grim, as was Holbein&apos;s, reminding us that death is no respecter of persons. As Kentridge&apos;s range gets bigger, his focus just gets more acute. \u00b7 William Kentridge: Fragile Identities is showing at various site in Brighton until December 31.

When all the available evidence points so strongly in the opposite direction, we think we are such a big footballing country with such talented players that merely appointing the right coach would quickly see us soaring back where we belong. Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Arsene Wenger and even Jurgen Klinsmann are all being mentioned. Luiz Felipe Scolari and Guus Hiddink have receded somewhat in the betting, partly because their own qualification campaigns were not that great and partly because they will be occupied until summer at least. &apos;Unbelievably arrogant,&apos; was Manchester City&apos;s Croatian defender Vedran Corluka&apos;s summary of the English condition, and it is hard not to agree. No sooner had Israel gifted England a get-out-of-jail card they scarcely deserved than Peter Crouch was talking up the possibility of winning the tournament. While still praying for a miracle in Tel Aviv, Steve McClaren actually suggested that if England were handed a lifeline the game against Croatia at Wembley would &apos;take care of itself&apos;. Yet Croatia, as Corluka acidly pointed out, came to Wembley top of the group. The lack of respect they received from England provided their main motivation, very much to England&apos;s cost. It was not just McClaren&apos;s dismally parochial outlook or the childish booing of the Croatian anthem at Wembley, it was the reaction of the English media to the initial defeat in Zagreb, when it was almost universally suggested that Slaven Bilic did not possess a single player capable of getting into the England team. &apos;Wake up, gentlemen,&apos; was Bilic&apos;s politely restrained message in the Wembley press room after trouncing England even more convincingly a second time. Not being a manager, Corluka saw no need to tread as carefully. &apos;We&apos;ve shown again that we are a better team and it&apos;s a real pleasure to kick England out of the European Championship.&apos; That is how the rest of the world sees us and the rest of the world will now watch with amusement as we try to find a manager worthy enough to meet our high ideals. The gap between how anyone perceives themselves and how they are viewed by others is often amusing, sometimes in these very circumstances. A few years ago a vox pop of Sunderland fans about who should be their new manager produced names such as Johan Cruyff, Marcello Lippi and George Graham. They ended up with Howard Wilkinson and Steve Cotterill. In addition to being monumentally arrogant, England are staggeringly unoriginal in these matters, too. Never mind the usual suspects, the name staring them in the face is that of Bilic. He spent a good while playing here, something few of the other foreign candidates can say, has proved himself in international management quickly and has a perfect head-to-head record against England. He is not ideal FA material in that he smokes, drinks and is more of an outspoken maverick than Brian Clough would ever have been, yet in his favour he is young, relatively cheap and keen on England. So if England are looking for a foreign coach they should put in a call to Zagreb right now and, bearing in mind the Scolari fiasco last year, keep everything under their hat until after the finals. Bilic may not be the best coach around but he knocks spots off McClaren, has put Hiddink in the shade and is certainly good enough for England. If nothing else, we would be in for an entertaining few years. I still remember interviewing him at Everton 10 years ago, when he decided against a chat at the training ground and drove a couple of us instead to a local pub, where he insisted on buying beer and cigarettes for the party before sitting down to talk. McClaren never did that once, even after dragging the nation&apos;s football scribes to North Yorkshire for press conferences in his home village of Yarm. Which is a lovely place, by the way. There must have been some other reason why the words &apos;No more Yarm&apos; were practically being sung in chorus in the press areas at Wembley on Wednesday. There is only one flaw in the Bilic plan and it is quite a big one. England, at this juncture, should not be looking for a foreign coach. If we have any pride as a football nation we should be responding to the humiliation of Wednesday by reinventing and reinvigorating ourselves, not hiring someone from abroad to do it. It is debatable, anyway, whether one man can really make a difference when the pool of players is so small and so many of them are always injured. But importing success is what we do in the Premier League. England may have the richest and most entertaining league in the world, yet increasingly we are seen merely as hosts to that competition. We have all the conditions for commercial viability in this country but the Premier League is a league in England, in no sense is it an English league. Unless we want to be seen simply as an attractive venue, like Wimbledon for tennis, we cannot afford to franchise out the England team as well. Were the Premier League more of an indigenous source of pride, pulling in viewers while still producing healthy crops of young English players and managers of the future, then there would be no harm whatsoever in importing ideas and guidance. It is often forgotten in football discussions that we are an island race, with all the detachment, resistance to change and, yes, insularity that implies. We are bound to be less receptive to new ideas than the rest of Europe; our whole culture is one of sticking to what we know and doing what we always have done. English football could exist for centuries without ever producing a manager in the mould of Mourinho or Wenger, just as our teams could happily play from here to eternity without seeing the need to change from 4-4-2. Like it or not, the archetypical English manager is Sam Allardyce. A friend with a child involved in youth football at the moment reports that week in, week out, on park pitches all over the country, the players of tomorrow are being supervised by morose, shouty types with big coats and a gruff manner who play big lads at the back and at the front and like to keep things as simple as possible in between. Grassroots football in England produces Allardyce clones by the dozen. We seem genetically incapable of even imitating anything more stylish or original. That is, of course, an excellent reason for importing foreign talent, freshness and thinking into our well loved and somewhat fossilised game. And we have. The Premier League is full of it. It is a long time since any of the top-four clubs looked to England for a manager, Arsenal regularly play without any English input, and even mid-ranking clubs can boast only a handful of local players. It could be said that the Premier League is at saturation point with imports, which is exactly why the national team must remain an expression of English ability. It may not be a shortcut to success, but appointing another English coach is simply the right thing to do. That would not necessarily exclude Martin O&apos;Neill, or even Sir Alex Ferguson or Mark Hughes. They are all products of English football - Fergie&apos;s 21 years at Manchester United is exactly the same length of time Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson spent at Ipswich between them - and though pedants may argue about birthplaces, what is important now is for English football to be seen to be replenishing itself. McClaren was not the best of the British candidates last time, so his failure does not necessarily mean the cupboard is bare. Neither should the FA hawk the job around Europe when there are pressing problems at home. Chief of those is that not enough good players are being produced. Second is that English football has lost all confidence in its own ability. If the Germans had a brainwave with Klinsmann, then what we should do is not go for Klinsmann ourselves, but have a brainwave of our own. Come on down, Teddy Sheringham! Or Tony Adams. Or Harry Redknapp. Anyone, really, just to show that we have some ideas left.

While Toritti gets on with the business of making the world safe for democracy and capitalism, by planting juicy disinformation in the path of the suspected mole and waiting to see if he snaffles it (known in the trade as giving a barium meal, a piece of jargon that clearly so pleased all the boys involved in the making of The Company that it gets repeated 83,467 times), Jack gets on with sleeping with Lili. In the post-coital haze, she announces that, &quot;The moment I treasure most is when I wake from heavy sleep . . . For a few delicious seconds I am in a huge void, free of gravity. At such moments I dance as I have never been able to before. That is what it is like when I am with you.&quot; This raises two suspicions. One is that the writer of The Company, Ken Nolan, is rather more interested in scripting the dirty, rotten, espionagey parts of his endeavour than the romantic bits, and two, that, as Jack does not run screaming from the room at the prospect of listening to that load of old ballons for the rest of his life, all the rumours about the willingness of ballerinas to exploit their professional bendiness in the service of personal pleasures must be true. Another complication - I am already bleeding from the ears at this point - is Yevgeny Tsipin. He was a friend of Jack&apos;s at Yale, but returned to Mother Russia for his real mother&apos;s funeral, only to find that his father had been a KGB spy all his life, the Kremlin had paid for his education and now felt the time had come for him to start giving something back to the communist community. Or, as recruitment bod Pavel Zhilov put it, &quot;I am offering you the chance to follow in the footsteps of men who carve out history from blank stone!&quot; And mix their metaphors like a Molotov cocktail, comrade, but that need not, I suppose, concern us here. What does concern us is that he is helping the MI6 double agent called Parsifal, and Toritti is closing in on him. Eventually, after a visit to Simon Callow in London and Antony Sher in Tel Aviv, and after much muttering among men in trenchcoats and shadows, and an ambush by more men, this time in period cars and hats, Toritti learns that Parsifal&apos;s real name is Kim Philby. Duh-duh-duuuh! Then Jack learns that Rainbow is not Lili but Helga La Fuente (which goes some way to explaining why she jet\u00e9-ed towards a career big on pseudonyms), and that she is in fact working for the KGB, altering the messages the Professor gives her without his knowledge, in order to protect him in return for him saving her from drunken Russian soldiers as they rampaged through Germany. Look, do at least try to keep up - I had to. She begs him to save them both and he, presumably still in thrall to the power of the pli\u00e9, agrees. But the KGB get to them first and Rainbow- Lili-Helga ends up killing herself. I suspect he is secretly relieved, but I may just be projecting.

At first you fear it is going to buckle under the weight of its own importance, as Alfred Molina (Harvey Torriti, the CIA&apos;s station chief in Berlin) sits in an artfully lit window looking out on to a chiaroscuro scene, talking about &quot;this dirty, rotten rainwash of a city&quot; and the &quot;Goths at its gate&quot;. But soon the need to keep track amid the gloom - apparently light was rationed throughout the cold war - of all the agents, double-agents, crosses, double-crosses and intentionally and unintentionally hybridised European accents becomes a far more pressing concern. Toritti knows there is a KGB mole in MI6. He tells James Jesus Angleton of his fears, partly because Angleton is his boss and partly because he is played by Michael Keaton and it would otherwise be a bit of a waste of the fee. He also tells his colleague Jack McAuliffe, but he isn&apos;t really listening because he has been given the job of &quot;handling an asset&quot; - in this case, collecting decoded messages from an enigmatic ballerina called Rainbow. At first she requires him to turn away decorously while she fishes about in her cleavage for the scraps of silk on which the mysterious Professor, with whom she lives, has printed lots of information that will help Jack and Harvey purge the world of communism.

They would have been joined in victory by two of last Wednesday&apos;s three substitutes, Jermain Defoe and Darren Bent, had the former not screwed up his stoppage-time penalty kick at Upton Park. The third man, David Beckham, was presumably resting in preparation for the LA Galaxy&apos;s exhibition matches in Australia and New Zealand next week. They can&apos;t be all that terrible, then. Because the Premier League is the best league in the world, isn&apos;t it? That&apos;s certainly what you&apos;d have thought, anyway, if you&apos;d listened with your eyes shut to the television commentary on the 1-1 draw between West Ham and Spurs on Sunday, the kind of match that keeps a full stadium on the boil and has Sky&apos;s pundits drooling over the non-stop action. Had you opened your eyes and actually watched the match with a measure of objectivity, you might have reached another conclusion altogether. It was hectic, at times abrasively combative, and almost completely lacking in coherent design. In technical and tactical terms, it wasn&apos;t all that much better - give or take a few touches from Dimitar Berbatov and Carlton Cole - than the FA Cup first-round tie between Hampton and Richmond Borough FC and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge that I watched a couple of weeks ago. The players were fitter, of course, and could run hard for longer, but all that achieved was to reduce the time and space for anyone to put his foot on the ball and impose a sense of order on the game. Yes, it was a London derby, and one with a history of high emotion. If the influx of foreigners has influenced any aspect of the English game, however, surely it must have been in injecting a little calmness and technique into such heated confrontations? On this evidence, emphatically not so. It is true that 10 of the starting 22 were qualified to play for England, an unusually high number in the Premier League these days, but the likes of Pascal Chimbonda, Didier Zokora, Lucas Neill and Nolberto Solano appeared just as charged-up as their English team-mates. With only a few exceptions, the Premier League has reshaped the play of its foreign imports, rather than allowing them to usher it into a new age of enlightenment. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is virtually alone in building an entire philosophy that runs against the traditional currents of the English game. Even Jose Mourinho favoured directness and used to throw Robert Huth or John Terry up front when Chelsea were chasing the game, a ploy associated with the industrial era of English football management. In his Bolton days Sam Allardyce persuaded players with foreign-bred skills to play the English way, and now he appears to be trying the same thing at St James&apos; Park. From that perspective, you might conclude that the foreign invasion has had very little impact on the general approach of teams in the Premier League. It remains a brand of football based on pace, commitment, instant excitement and a desperation born of the fear of relegation, which is why it is so popular around the world. But, as we saw last week, that will not do in today&apos;s international environment, any more than it was good enough to prevail during the visits of Puskas&apos;s Hungarians in 1953, Netzer&apos;s West Germans in 1972 and Cruyff&apos;s Dutch in 1977. A player such as Cesc F\u00e1bregas is clever enough to flourish in the English league and then take his place in his national team without missing a beat. It is not hard to imagine Luka Modric, the delicate mainspring of Croatia&apos;s counterattacks, adapting to life here. But England&apos;s own players, inadequately taught and never encouraged to broaden their horizons, continue to assume that the same approach will do for every occasion. It is hard to see any new head coach, however brilliant, breaking that pattern until after the rest of the world has tired of the Premier League, moved on to the next spectacle, and demolished the basis of the freakish prosperity that now hinders the evolution of the English game. Time to blow the whistle on never-ending anthems The singing of Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika and Die Stem before Saturday&apos;s rugby international in Cardiff prompted the thought that nations which insist on turning their national anthems into medleys should pay a price for trying the patience of their hosts, if they are playing away, or their guests, if they are at home. The tariffs could be calculated on a sliding scale. In rugby, for example, a double anthem such as that favoured by the Springboks could incur a penalty of five points. A country like Argentina or Italy, whose anthem is preceded by a mini-overture, could forfeit three points. Then there might be special categories: the dirge-like Flower of Scotland, for instance, would warrant a 10-point penalty. And isn&apos;t it time, incidentally, that South Africa reversed the order of its medley? As things stands, the gloriously sonorous ANC anthem sounds like a mere prelude to the old Afrikaner hymn. Perhaps rugby could take a lead and do what this column has already advocated in respect of football, abolishing the whole problem by appointing Pavarotti&apos;s recording of Nessun Dorma as a kind of pan-national anthem, expressing all the loftier aspirations and none of the darker underside of humankind&apos;s competitive instincts. Three strikes and Hunt will be as good as out The dreadful foul perpetrated by Stephen Hunt, the Reading midfielder, on Gelson Fernandes of Manchester City at the weekend earned him only a yellow card from the referee but must have prompted many observers to re-run the mental images of Hunt&apos;s collision with Petr Cech, the Chelsea goalkeeper, just over a year ago. As a result of the damage he suffered in that incident, Cech now wears a helmet to protect him against further head injury. Opinions were divided at the time, but most observers concluded that it had been a 50-50 collision. After Saturday&apos;s studs-up horror, from which the victim was fortunate to emerge unscathed, it might not be so easy to give Hunt the benefit of the doubt next time. Pendleton earns herself a shot at the BBC podium Congratulations to the track cyclist Victoria Pendleton, named Britain&apos;s woman athlete of the year by the Sunday Times this week, a choice fully justified by her three gold medals at this year&apos;s world championships. Pendleton&apos;s achievements are also a tribute to British Cycling&apos;s exceptional success in developing talent. She won&apos;t beat Lewis Hamilton or, depending on the outcome of next week&apos;s fight, Ricky Hatton, to the BBC&apos;s sports personality of the year award, but she deserves a place on the podium, at the very least. Hiddink over the hump and heading for the Alps  Apologies to Guus Hiddink, belittled in this column last week for the failure of his Russia team to get something from their visit to Tel Aviv. The day after those words appeared, England imploded at Wembley and Russia beat Andorra.

But for the taciturn Avram Grant, Chelsea&apos;s record has failed to pipe up loud enough. Grant has 10 wins in 14 matches and is undefeated since the first of them, a 2-0 reverse at Old Trafford after only three days at the helm. These are impressive statistics but he still has his doubters and detractors in the game. Most recently came Alan Curbishley&apos;s criticism on Thursday. The West Ham United manager was speaking ahead of his team&apos;s trip today to Stamford Bridge and he remarked that when you compare the Chelsea of Jose Mourinho and that of his successor, Grant&apos;s impact has been negligible. &quot;They&apos;re talking it up but if you care to look at it, there&apos;s not much difference,&quot; Curbishley said. &quot;They are talking as if it&apos;s a different game but the foundations and squad are what Mourinho left.&quot; Of course such comments could be aimed at rattling his opponent: the kind of barb most managers aim at their adversaries before important matches. It could also be motivated by Curbishley&apos;s trade unionist&apos;s instinct as a leading member of the League Managers&apos; Association, railing against a man perceived to have undermined Mourinho before taking his job. But take up Curbishley&apos;s challenge to examine how Grant has gone about his work behind the scenes and it is clear that care has been taken to ensure that as much as possible of what the Portuguese put in place is preserved. When Mourinho left he took with him one of his assistant managers, Baltemar Brito; his conditioning coach, Rui Faria; his chief scout, Andre Villas Boas; and his goalkeeping coach, Silvinho Louro. When Grant stepped in to Mourinho&apos;s shoes he had the continuity of Steve Clarke as assistant manager and new men were hired for old roles. In came Michael Emenalo, a former Nigeria international who has stayed in touch with Grant since a shared spell at Maccabi Tel Aviv. Then there was Henk Ten Cate, Frank Rijkaard&apos;s European Cup-winning assistant at Barcelona who quit his post as Ajax manager to become Grant&apos;s assistant. Mick McGiven, the former reserve-team manager, was promoted to match observer scout and charged with checking out opposition teams in a role previously occupied by Villas Boas. &quot;Basically it&apos;s been people filling in the roles from the void left by what there was before,&quot; said one dressing-room source. &quot;There was a foreign coach and a British coach and that&apos;s what there is now. Everyone&apos;s just filled in the positions vacated by Mourinho&apos;s people. And it&apos;s the same style of people.&quot; So for the quiet but occasionally abrasive Brito there is now the combustible Ten Cate. McGiven takes his computer where the Championship Manager-addicted Boas once went and Emenalo is, like Faria, the trusted lieutenant who might be called upon to act suspiciously under a big woolly hat if ever his manager is given a touchline ban. There is nothing wrong with adopting the Portuguese prototype that has fostered so much success. But how much influence does the man at the top really have for his reported \u00a32.8m-a-year contract? Marcel Desailly, the former Chelsea captain who remains intimately connected with some in the Chelsea dressing room, believes the answer is very little. &quot;He is lucky that he has such professional players,&quot; said Desailly when asked for his opinion as a Match Of The Day pundit. &quot;The players said to themselves, wasn&apos;t it beautiful when we were winning everything? Come on, let us do this again.&quot; The one area where Grant drew applause from Desailly was in having done away with the divisive &quot;untouchables&quot; policy to which Mourinho previously clung and it is something that those who know Grant expected. Ronen Harazi, a former Israel player who declares himself a Grant admirer, says that the Chelsea manager is a &quot;master psychologist - he makes every player feel like they are the best in the world&quot;. But it is debatable whether that kind of deft touch is necessary in Chelsea&apos;s dressing room, which is dominated by English players who have apparently bullet-proof self-belief - confidence that led to some reportedly engaging in extreme excesses of drunkenness at Shaun Wright-Phillips&apos;s birthday celebrations last month. And besides, one club insider tells the story differently. &quot;I don&apos;t know what Grant does,&quot; said the source. &quot;He doesn&apos;t take the training sessions, Ten Cate and Clarke do that. There&apos;s no patterns to the teams he&apos;s picked: one minute Shaun plays and he&apos;s man of the match, the next he&apos;s dropped and not even on the bench. &quot;All this about him being a psychologist and having the best man-management is rubbish too. He never spoke to Shaun when he dropped him. He asked Steve Clarke to tell Tal Ben Haim he was going to drop him - he wouldn&apos;t do it himself because they are from the same country and he said it would be better if it comes from somebody else. &quot;I believe he thinks that if he plays everybody, everybody will be happy. It&apos;s early days at the moment and the players are getting on with it, but one day that will be a problem.&quot; Results should, of course, be the guide. But for all his team&apos;s victories, at the moment Grant cannot win.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-01T00:08:14Z", "title": "The Grant effect: a bright new start or more of the same?", "sentences": ["In came Michael Emenalo, a former Nigeria international who has stayed in touch with Grant since a shared spell at Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/01/newsstory.chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Life and style"], "article": "The security expert, Bruce Schneier, is fond of pointing out that there are several fairly straightforward ways to hijack or bomb an aeroplane. Garottes can be made from fishing line or dental floss, and the snapped-off handle of a wheeled bag makes &quot;a pretty effective spear&quot;. Alternatively, you could buy some steel epoxy glue from a hardware store: it comes in two tubes, one containing steel dust and the other hardener, which can be combined in-flight and moulded into a stubby steel knife, using a metal teaspoon as a handle. (Neither steel epoxy glue nor metal teaspoons are prohibited in hand luggage on flights departing from the UK or the US - unlike, say, snow globes, which are banned under US rules.) If you would rather use liquid explosive, simply label the bottles &quot;saline solution&quot; and board in the US, where you are allowed to travel with as much saline solution as you wish. Or you could risk it at a British airport: when security staff find liquids in volumes greater than 100ml - and they have been known to seize an estimated five tonnes nationwide in a single day - all they usually do is place them in an open bin and let the offending passenger continue unpenalised. Nor is it a problem if you&apos;re on the US &quot;no-fly list&quot;, the register of people deemed too dangerous to fly (&quot;But too innocent to arrest,&quot; as Schneier puts it). Just target a flight for which you don&apos;t need photo identification, and no one need ever know you&apos;re on the list. Schneier tested this recently, taking a domestic flight from Minneapolis with no photo ID and little hassle. The terms and conditions of at least one British budget airline suggest the same may be possible here. &quot;There are precisely two things that have made air travel safer since 9/11 - locks on cockpit doors and teaching passengers that they have to fight back,&quot; says Schneier, who is chief technology officer for the security consultancy Counterpane, owned by BT. He is 44, a computer scientist by training, with a greying ponytail and the quiet voice of someone secure in his opinions and unconcerned about winning you over. &quot;You can argue there&apos;s a third, sky marshals. But, actually, once you tell people you have them, you don&apos;t really need them. It&apos;s the idea of sky marshals that makes us safer, not the marshals themselves.&quot; From time to time, Schneier chalks up a victory in the war against what he calls the &quot;silly security season&quot; of the post-9/11 era. For example, last July, US authorities lifted a ban on cigarette lighters, conceding it was pointless, given that matches or batteries could just as easily be used to ignite a bomb. Mainly, though, he sees irrationality and wasted money, including in the measures recently announced by Gordon Brown to beef up security at UK airports, railway stations and elsewhere, constructing barriers around buildings and improving their blast-resistance at a cost of \u00a31bn. A posting on Schneier&apos;s blog, describing how this would affect Liverpool Lime Street, but not less busy stations nearby, was called &quot;UK Spends Billions To Force Terrorists To Drive A Little Further.&quot; Talking to Schneier and reading his essays does something strange to your brain: you start seeing security loopholes and idiocies everywhere. You will be at Heathrow&apos;s terminal three, for example, having passed through the main security check, and you&apos;ll be shuffling in line towards a second search point, where people are taking off their shoes to be x-rayed, when you&apos;ll realise that they are queueing for the shoe-check only because everyone in front of them is doing so: inexplicably, it appears to be optional, and you can just step around it - as I did - with no apparent adverse consequences. You might then begin to share Schneier&apos;s suspicion that the whole system of air security is based on a set of misunderstandings, not complex or technical but so obvious that even most professionals in the field - perhaps especially the professionals - can&apos;t see them, or don&apos;t want to think about them. You might even come to understand the frustration of Elwood Menear, a pilot with US Airways, who was escorted to jail in January 2002 after asking a security screener at Philadelphia International Airport the following question: &quot;Why are you worried about tweezers when I could crash the plane?&quot; What they refer to at Heathrow simply as &quot;the crisis&quot; began at 2am on August 10 last year, with the arrival of a fax from the Department for Transport. It informed BAA that they had until the next batch of passengers started arriving - at 4am - radically to change security procedures, banning liquids and all other carry-on items except money, essential documents, medicines and baby food. By 3am, BAA executives were arriving at the airport to be there in advance of the 2,000 security staff about to show up for their shifts with no idea about the changes. In the hours that followed, police raided homes in London, Birmingham and High Wycombe, and announced, in time for the morning news, the foiling of an alleged plot to destroy up to 10 transatlantic jets. Almost immediately, Heathrow became a hellhole of static queues and furious passengers. Sheer volume of people is its biggest problem at the best of times, and neither the staff nor the buildings could cope - especially inside terminal two, built in the 50s, when there were no security procedures at all. &quot;One of the criticisms put to us was that we didn&apos;t have a contingency in place,&quot; a BAA spokesman said as we toured the terminal&apos;s cramped security screening area. &quot;Well, our workload increased fourfold. If the argument is that we didn&apos;t have a contingency that allowed us, in the space of two hours, to quadruple our manpower, I think we&apos;d say, &apos;Fair cop.&apos; I don&apos;t think you could ask any business to do that. But that&apos;s not to say we couldn&apos;t have done some things better.&quot; Transit passengers arriving with bottles of duty-free alcohol had them confiscated. &quot;People were really, really mad, as you can imagine.&quot; Heathrow has since hired 500 additional security staff. The legacy of August 2006 is today&apos;s ban on liquids in volumes larger than 100ml, and the requirement for all liquids to be carried in a clear plastic bag. (The one-bag-per-person carry-on restriction is likely to be lifted next year.) It all feels unprecedentedly severe, an impression encouraged by John Reid, the home secretary at the time, who spoke of the need to respond to an unparalleled level of threat. But, seen from another perspective, the clampdown was far more predictable. It was just another move in a cat-and-mouse game between terrorists and the authorities that began in the late 60s - exemplified best by the enduringly mysterious tale of Dan Cooper. The man who called himself Dan Cooper was wearing a dark suit and raincoat when he boarded a Boeing 727, operated by Northwest Airlines, in Portland, Oregon, on the night of November 24 1971. Once the plane was in the air, headed for Seattle, he lit a cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda. Then he passed a note to the 23-year-old stewardess, Florence Schaffner, who at first assumed he was flirting, and didn&apos;t bother to read it. &quot;Miss, you&apos;d better look at that note,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;I have a bomb.&quot; She unfolded the piece of paper. &quot;I have a bomb in my briefcase,&quot; it read. &quot;I will use it if necessary. I want you to sit beside me.&quot; Schaffner sat down, and Cooper opened his bag, revealing a mass of batteries and wires. Via Schaffner, Cooper communicated his demands to the captain. When the plane landed at Seattle, he wanted $200,000 in cash and four parachutes. He got them, and released everyone except the captain and another stewardess. Then he ordered the plane back into the air, flying in the direction of Mexico City and keeping to an altitude of below 10,000ft. He strapped on two of the parachutes, pocketed the money, and asked the stewardess how to lower the 727&apos;s rear steps. Somewhere over Washington state, he climbed into the freezing night and vanished. The case has never been solved. In 1980, a family picnicking in the Washington countryside found almost $6,000 of the ransom money, but that was all. (This may be about to change: earlier this year, the FBI managed to extract DNA from a tie that Cooper abandoned on board, and a retired postal worker has presented convincing evidence that his deceased brother, a former Northwest employee, was the culprit, according to New York magazine.) Since then, the evolution of airport security has been a simple matter of back-and-forth: terrorists exploit a weakness, governments address the weakness and terrorists look for a new one. The Dan Cooper affair led to the invention of the &quot;Cooper vane&quot;, a wedge to stop stairways being lowered in flight. From the early 70s, metal detectors and x-ray machines made it hard to smuggle guns onboard. In the 80s, terrorists starting smuggling bombs into the hold, but not boarding the flights themselves, so passenger bag-matching was introduced. In 1985, a Hezbollah front group used cleaners at Athens airport to place guns in the lavatory of a TWA plane, so screening of airport employees began to be taken more seriously. In 1986, an Irish chambermaid working at the Park Lane Hilton in London was stopped at Heathrow in possession of a bomb, placed in her bag without her knowledge by her Jordanian boyfriend. Ever since, security staff have asked passengers, &quot;Did you pack your luggage yourself?&quot; and &quot;Has anybody asked you to carry anything?&quot; In the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001, the terrorists rewrote the rules again, this time more comprehensively than ever before, by proving themselves willing to die. &quot;This is the security game,&quot; Schneier says. &quot;We take away guns, so they use bombs. We take away bombs, they use boxcutters. We take away boxcutters, they hide explosives in their shoes. Take away shoes, they use liquids.&quot; Take away liquids, he might have added, and they attack airports, as at Glasgow earlier this year; Brown&apos;s plans for barriers and parking exclusion zones follow the rules of the game perfectly. The authorities&apos; next moves are being put in place at Heathrow&apos;s new terminal five, due to open in March. At the moment, the terminal&apos;s vast main hall is almost silent, the cathedral-like calm broken only by small groups of British Airways staff on introductory tours, and the movements of thousands of pieces of dummy luggage to test the baggage-handling system. When passengers arrive, they will encounter the state of the art in security systems, including machines that can identify liquids and explosives hidden in bags, giving staff a 3D view of the contents, and highlighting questionable materials with a red rectangle. Travellers will also have their fingerprints taken and their faces scanned. Ian Hutcheson, BAA&apos;s director of security, is proud of the new system, but even he concedes it&apos;s far from perfect. &quot;It&apos;s not utopia. Utopia looks like a portal that you&apos;d walk through, carrying everything, and you get a red or a green light, and if you get a green light you keep on walking to the plane. We&apos;re a long way from that.&quot; Technology is only part of the problem: utopia would also mean more space and staff than even terminal five will provide. Already, there are full-body &quot;backscatter&quot; scanners that can see under clothes, and sealed glass pods in which passengers are blasted with jets of air to displace stray particles that can be analysed for traces of explosive. But they are not much use if employing them on a large scale would slow queues to a halt. And even the best detection systems rely on alert human operators; on several recent occasions in the US, screeners have missed a clear majority of items placed in baggage by security officials as a test. Besides, Hutcheson is the first to concede that security isn&apos;t really a question of advancing towards utopia. It can never be perfect: it&apos;s a trade-off. We spend billions of pounds and tolerate airport queues in order to feel safe, &quot;but the debate that&apos;s never had is, how much risk are you prepared to accept?&quot; The question is crucial, because air security obeys the law of diminishing returns. The more money we spend, and the more we slow down the process of travel, the smaller the added security benefit we obtain each time. The basic bag-check is by far the most important deterrent measure; everything else merely targets one specific method of attack. But since anything can be a weapon - even a pair of bare hands, used skilfully - there&apos;s no conceivable end to the back-and-forth; we just invite terrorists to concoct new tactics. Meanwhile, queues lengthen and people become more edgy - which was the terrorists&apos; goal to begin with. &quot;It&apos;s a game we can&apos;t win,&quot; Schneier says. &quot;We should stop playing!&quot; Which leaves one more option, largely absent from the British approach to security, and fraught with ethical difficulties: if you can&apos;t stop people bringing bad things on to aircraft, why not try to identify the bad people instead? Replace technology with psychology, in other words. &quot;The way to prevent aeroplane terrorism is not to keep objects that could fall into the wrong hands off aeroplanes,&quot; Schneier says. &quot;A better goal is to keep those with the wrong hands from boarding aeroplanes in the first place.&quot; In October, I flew from Heathrow to Tel Aviv and back on El Al, the Israeli national airline. Since the first and only successful attack on an El Al plane, in 1968, the airline has earned a reputation as the world&apos;s most secure. In part, this is thanks to armed marshals disguised as passengers on every flight, advanced bag-scanning systems and cockpit doors that cannot be opened in flight. But it is also a result of El Al&apos;s psychology-focused approach to assessing the risks posed by passengers - as I discovered on my return flight from Ben Gurion International Airport. I was one of the first to arrive for the flight, and before I could reach the check-in desk I was ushered aside to another counter, where a thirtyish airline employee addressed me from behind a computer display. I explained the purpose of my trip - interviewing the employees of a software company - and where I had stayed and for how long. She asked to see my notes and tape recorder, and listened to a minute or so of my interviews. &quot;Is there someone at the company who we could call?&quot; I gave her the managing director&apos;s name and mobile phone number; she left a message on his voicemail. &quot;So,&quot; she said, &quot;you were working in Tel Aviv but you went to Jerusalem as a tourist?&quot; Her tone throughout was one of polite amusement. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Did you meet anyone in Jerusalem?&quot; &quot;I had a drink with the Guardian&apos;s correspondent.&quot; &quot;Do you have a camera? Some photos from Jerusalem?&quot; I handed over my camera and, at her request, showed her how to display the date of each photograph. She flicked through the pictures, then narrowed her eyes. &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; she said. &quot;You said you were in Jerusalem. This is a picture of boats on the sea. There&apos;s no sea in Jerusalem.&quot; &quot;I took that from my hotel window in Tel Aviv. It&apos;s the marina.&quot; &quot;Did you go to any private homes in Jerusalem?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Do you know anyone there?&quot; &quot;Well, like I said, I had a drink...&quot; More questions about Jerusalem followed. &quot;And did anybody ask you to carry anything?&quot; she asked at last. &quot;No,&quot; I said. She looked suddenly stern. &quot;You do realise I&apos;m asking you in case somebody might have used you to put a bomb in your bag?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; She beamed at me. &quot;Thanks. Enjoy your flight.&quot; The exchange took almost half an hour - not long, compared with many anecdotes of flying El Al, but much longer than it would have taken to search my bag by hand, or to put me through a body-scanner. Nor was any of the information I gave recorded, as far as I could tell. The airline&apos;s sole calculation appeared to be that reading my body language - and seeing if I could keep my story straight in the face of being asked the same questions, over and over again - was a better way to judge if I posed a threat. El Al refuses to discuss its security procedures, but judging by comments from former staff, however, its employees would have started constructing a psychological profile of me from the moment I booked my ticket, then watched me up to the gate. &quot;We study the way people walk around the airport, we make a careful note of the kind of language they use, the dialect, and their behaviour,&quot; Leo Gleser, a former El Al security officer, said shortly after 9/11. &quot;We see if they are on their own and with whom they have contact. And we study their eyes. There are many ways in which terrorists betray that they are not feeling comfortable ... The whole point of profiling is to concentrate effort where it is most needed.&quot; The word &quot;profiling&quot;, however, invokes the spectre of ethnic profiling, a charge El Al has not escaped: it is widely maintained that passengers with Arab names or appearances are singled out for tough questioning, while Hebrew-speakers are classed as low-risk: leaving London for Tel Aviv, I was asked if I spoke Hebrew. Even apart from ethical considerations, the overwhelming conclusion of studies by US criminologists is that racial profiling simply doesn&apos;t work: it does not result in more guilty people being identified. But person-by-person psychological profiling is a different matter. It need not be racist at all. It just takes a lot of time and money. &quot;The El Al model is a totally different model, based on differentiation,&quot; says Ian Hutcheson at Heathrow. &quot;They differentiate through questioning. And if you have one or two flights a day from Heathrow - three at the very maximum - you can do that. But if you&apos;re British Airways, and you&apos;re operating God knows how many flights, you can&apos;t.&quot; So could El Al&apos;s approach ever be adapted to cope with the volume of an airport such as Heathrow, through which 63m passengers pass each year? To find out, I had lunch with Paul Ekman, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California. This was a disconcerting prospect, because Ekman is the world&apos;s leading expert in the study of &quot;microexpressions&quot; - the fleeting expressions that flash involuntarily across our faces, in response to people or events, in the split-second before we consciously gain control of our features. Disgust, guilt, anger: our true emotions are exposed before we can repress them - which means that when you dine with Ekman, you can&apos;t shake the suspicion that he might be able, in effect, to read your mind. &quot;Well, once you learn to read microexpressions, you can&apos;t really turn it off,&quot; smiled Ekman, a vigorous 73-year-old who is celebrated as the co-creator of the Facial Action Coding System, a catalogue of every one of the 10,000 expressions it is possible to make with the 43 muscles of the human face. &quot;But you have to be careful with how you use it, because it&apos;s stolen information.&quot; He has been hired to teach microexpression-recognition skills to the CIA, the FBI, Scotland Yard and airport staff around the world. The basics can be learned in around an hour, he says - resulting in measurable improvements in the ability to detect when people are lying. In the 60s, Ekman conducted studies among isolated tribes in New Guinea, and communities in south America and Japan, which established that the basic repertoire of human expressions is universal. Contrary to the opinion of sceptical anthropologists, notably Margaret Mead, it turns out that we all express happiness, anger, fear, disgust and guilt in essentially the same way. Subsequent studies demonstrated that police officers were often little better than university students in identifying liars. Ekman is training airport staff to pay close attention to microexpressions during routine interactions with passengers, and to scan queues for suspicious behaviour, though he won&apos;t specify the expressions that indicate danger - &quot;because terrorists read newspapers&quot;. Don&apos;t we all feel and act a bit guilty, though, when we pass through security or customs, just because we feel watched? &quot;Yes, but as best one can tell, from accounts of people who encountered the 9/11 terrorists, and from other terrorists, guilt was not what they were feeling about what they were about to do. So the fact that you&apos;re looking guilty is probably not going to draw anyone&apos;s attention.&quot; Earlier this year, it was reported that Glasgow airport had installed cameras tailored to allow the close study of passengers&apos; faces. If you trust the science, and can stomach the total loss of privacy within the airport, the potential is clearly great. &quot;Behavioural profiling has enormous value,&quot; Schneier agrees. &quot;It&apos;s hard to do right, and if you do it wrong, it quickly turns unpleasant. But done right, it has enormous value.&quot; Still, even behavioural psychology is only part of the answer. If an extremely serious plot was indeed disrupted in August last year, it was disrupted by intelligence work, not airport security. In any case, the efficacy of security can never be properly evaluated: if a stretch of time passes with no attacks, does that show that security measures are deterring attackers, or that the measures are unnecessary? In his book The Black Swan, the probability specialist Nassim Taleb points out that if some US legislator had driven through a law to seal cockpit doors before 9/11, he or she would never have received any credit when 9/11 failed to happen. As long as we believe technology will solve our problems, Schneier says, we will be subject to &quot;silly security&quot;. In his book, Beyond Fear, he recounts a story that became popular on the internet in the months after 9/11 about a plain-clothes sky marshal employed by a major airline to help protect its flights. One day the marshal was passing through security, following the special procedures that enabled him discreetly to bring his loaded firearm on to the flight, when a security screener stopped him. The gun was fine, the screener said - but the marshal would have to surrender his nail clippers. The story has never been confirmed. More than likely, it never happened.

Israel sets its own agenda as it has always done, with invariable use of the US veto at the UN and disregard for international law, as exemplified by the comment made by Ehud Olmert&apos;s spokesman Mark Regev: &quot;Israel will abide by all its obligations under the road map. Its obligations apply to the West Bank, Jerusalem is different. Jerusalem is our capital. It is Israeli sovereign territory.&quot; In fact, under the original UN general assembly resolution 181, which partitioned Palestine, the Greater Jerusalem area, including Bethlehem, was to come under international control as a corpus seperatum. Since 1967 metropolitan Jerusalem consists of unilaterally annexed areas, which have not been recognised as legal, by any country, including the US. Most foreign embassies are in Tel Aviv, the de facto capital of Israel. The surrounding suburbs of East Jerusalem are not only annexed, but are on mainly Palestinian owned and sequestrated land, which constitutes land theft. But international law, the Geneva conventions and UN resolutions 242, 446, 452 and 465 to name a few, all emphasise the &quot;inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;, for Israel to cease the establishment, construction and planning of settlements in the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and call on Israel to dismantle these settlements. Har Homa (or Abu Ghneim) constitutes part of an outer ring of settlements that cut off East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank. It was a beautiful forested mountain owned by Palestinian families from Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, as well as from the villages of Um Tuba and Sur Baher. Apart from the criminal and total deforestation of it to build the Har Homa fortress, houses there are now being sold at Israeli real estate expos in the UK and the US, which also could be deemed to constitute aiding and abetting a war crime under the Geneva convention. What is worse is the continual and cruel demolition of Palestinian houses designated as illegally built by a plethora of Israeli land laws, and the denial of planning permission to Palestinians to build on their own property. The aim is to boost the demographic superiority of the Jewish population in Jerusalem at the expense of the Palestinians. Architects and planners in Israel who design all these projects are contravening international professional codes and are complicit in this illegal political and military enterprise. In fact despite Oslo and the roadmap, and now Annapolis, settlements have been and will be expanding at an accelerating pace - not only the smaller outposts but the cities of Ariel and Maale Adumim which an earlier Peace Now report showed to be mainly on expropriated Palestinian-owned land. Even the Israeli Civil Administration in the OPT&apos;s designated &quot;state land&quot; is not Israeli land but part of what is supposed to constitute a future &quot;viable&quot; Palestinian state in the West Bank. The E-1 corridor plan, designed by the architect Shlomo Aronson to build 3,500 homes, links Jerusalem to Maale Adumim and was announced shortly before Annapolis. It is particularly ill-considered, as this will cut the West Bank into two, and sound the death knell of any future viability. More East Jerusalem land in Abu-Dis and Azaria is being expropriated to build a Palestinian-only road to skirt around Maale Adumim, and to complement the apartheid wall which will also surround this illegal mega-city-to-be, while confiscating more land, again dispossessing the Bedouin of Jahalin from their grazing areas. Israel&apos;s facts on the ground have in effect made the two-state solution impossible, creating a de facto one-state solution, but one in which half the population live under unquestionable apartheid conditions, and not the feature of a true democracy. Even within Israel, &quot;unrecognised&quot; villages that were there before the founding of the state are being demolished in the Galilee and the Negev, to complete the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and destruction of the hundreds of Palestinian villages that occurred pre- and post-1948, land now owned by the JNF, which is pursuing their well advertised &quot;Negev Challenge&quot;. It is interesting that Gordon Brown is now a patron of JNF-UK, which sponsors the new Negev settlements for Jewish-only citizens, thus compromising his position as an honest broker in the peace process. Whatever President Bush said in his famous letter to Ariel Sharon, even the major blocs, as all settlements in the West Bank, are completely illegal under international law and the Geneva convention. Promises to dismantle even the small outposts (as with the checkpoints) have been ignored - they were simply re-erected on the next hilltop. The year of negotiation to final status talks will see a completion of the wall, the major settlements, and the total annexation of the Jordan Valley. Without international pressure, the cessation of the colonial enterprise of frantic settlement construction, their evacuation by the settlers, recognising the refugees right of return, and a return to the Green Line, there will never be peace, and thus security, for Israel or Palestine.

However, it is widely assumed Israel would need at least American approval if not cooperation for any bombing mission. In particular, Israel&apos;s air force would need the US flight codes that would allow its planes to cross safely into Iran. When Israel requested those codes in 1991, to attack Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq during the first Gulf War, the United States refused and there was no Israeli strike.

Without a second thought, my friend said: &quot;Come on, get your stuff - we&apos;re going to see it for ourselves.&quot; We jumped in his car and drove to the scene of the crime, where a hushed crowd was gathered outside the decimated cafe, the street bathed in red neon from the dozens of emergency vehicles strewn along the pavement. This was, he told me, one of the most important lessons he could teach me about life in Israel. He wanted me to witness the cold reality of the conflict up close and personal, and see what emotional reactions it would trigger when I had to confront the violence in the flesh, rather than from behind the shield of my television or newspaper. And he was right - it opened my eyes far more than any number of media reports could, and was as important an experience as any other I went through in the build-up to my moving to Israel. Similar thinking was behind our group&apos;s journey to Auschwitz last week - to try and evoke the true horror of the Holocaust by placing us in the heart of where it actually took place. And the significance wasn&apos;t lost on the leaders&apos; 18-year-old charges, all of whom were in a state of severe apprehension the night before our visit. Their trepidation ranged from worrying about whether it was acceptable to bring cameras to the site, to whether it was bad form if they didn&apos;t break down in tears, to deeper concerns about &quot;not being sure if we&apos;re going there to mourn, or to understand, or both - or neither&quot;. Their fears were allayed by Jeremy, the group&apos;s educator, who calmed them down in the style of a football manager pacifying his team before a cup final. In the event, the whole experience threatened to be overshadowed by the inauspicious start to the day, in the sanitised and soulless grounds of the work camp, Auschwitz I. There the group was confronted with the uncomfortable truth of what Auschwitz has become - as much a tourist trap as a monument to the worst evil to which mankind can sink. On posters depicting barbed wire and guard towers, the legend &quot;Auschwitz: 1940-45&quot; was emblazoned, as though it was no more than a concert tour performed by a world-renowned rock band. Dozens of tour groups jostled for space among the narrow corridors of the original barracks, now converted into morbid museums depicting the horror of the Shoah. Men posed next to wooden signs reading &quot;Halt! Stoj!&quot; above a skull and crossbones motif, as their girlfriends aimed digital cameras at them to record the moment for posterity. There was the feeling that Auschwitz had gone the way of many other sites of historical evil and become merely a place for people to exercise their collective love of rubbernecking. The phenomenon&apos;s nothing new - from the public hangings at Tyburn to the bizarre way in which the London Dungeon has become a torture-based theme park, the world&apos;s fascination with other people&apos;s misery has inevitably drawn even Auschwitz into its web. On top of the Disneyland-style crowds, there was the problem that we knew what to expect, hence the impact of many of the exhibits was severely diluted. The kids had all seen the piles of shoes, spectacles and even human hair in their textbooks and in documentaries, long before being forced to confront them behind the glass walls in the camp, and consequently were left colder by the sight than might have been expected. However, all that changed once we left the crowds behind and headed up the road to the far emptier and far more chilling site of Birkenau, the death camp of the Auschwitz complex. There, bathed in the weak glow of a winter sun and covered in impossibly beautiful virgin snow, stood the scores of burnt-out buildings and crematoria where so many met their tortured ends at the hands of the Nazis. And, as we trudged through the ankle-deep drifts alongside the infamous train tracks, the true scale of the mass murder was brought home to us all. There, sandwiched between a pregnant sky swollen with snow and desolate earth similarly heaving with the ghosts of the Shoah, the enormity of the crime screamed at us all through the silence of the camp. Wrapped up in our winter warmest, appetites sated from the healthy lunch we&apos;d just consumed, we were of course in no way able to comprehend the true horror of life for those misfortunate enough to pass through Birkenau&apos;s gates into the hell within. But we took the opportunity to read aloud witness testimonies and extracts from academic texts to try to at least bring to life in a small way the suffering of the victims. We walked the length and breadth of the camp until the sun sank behind the barren trees of the forest, and then carried out our own private post-mortems in silence on the coach home. For me, as I&apos;ve alluded to before, it&apos;s not the genocidal intent of the Nazis that elevated the Holocaust to such a unique level, but rather the ruthless efficiency with which they managed to carry out their crimes. Plenty of other ethnic groups convinced of their own superiority have attempted similar atrocities over the course of history, but none managed to scale the dizzy heights of the Nazis&apos; achievements in terms of death and destruction. And it&apos;s precisely for that reason that a pilgrimage to the site of Auschwitz and Birkenau is an essential tool for anyone seeking to come to terms with mankind&apos;s ability to plumb the depths of depravity. Which is why, when we implore one another to &quot;Never Forget&quot;, it&apos;s actually to the world&apos;s credit that the crowds flock to Auschwitz I, regardless of the side-effects that this kind of macabre tourism inevitably brings. Even worse than thousands of camera-wielding sightseers would be a deserted and empty Auschwitz, because for the tree to make a noise when it falls in the forest, there has to be someone around to hear - and, fortunately, that&apos;s still the case in Auschwitz today.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-08T10:00:00Z", "title": "Confronting the past", "sentences": ["Train tracks, Auschwitz About five years ago, I was sitting with an Israeli friend in a bar in Herzliya when reports came through that a suicide bomber had struck in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/08/confrontingthepast"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Iran", "US news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "US military"], "article": "Senior Israeli officials warned yesterday that they were still considering a military strike against Iran, despite a fresh US intelligence report that concluded Tehran was no longer developing nuclear weapons.

Her arrival in Tel Aviv last week, announced by the Jewish Agency that encourages immigration to Israel, has seen Reinhardt lionised by the Israeli media and attaining an instant celebrity that has bewildered her, according to her son Sacha, but which she says the flamboyant Oskar Schindler himself would have thoroughly enjoyed. Speaking to The Observer last week from a hotel in Tel Aviv, where she plans to settle in sheltered accommodation close to her son and his family, Oskar Schindler&apos;s sometime secretary recalled the genesis of the list that would save so many lives, and her own part in it. &apos;I had been picked up in Krakow [where Schindler&apos;s factory was] for being a Jew and sent to Plaszow concentration camp, commanded by the notorious SS officer Amon Goeth. Schindler hired people from the camp to work in his factory. Speaking perfect German, and being able to write shorthand, had already proved her salvation in the slave labour battalions. &apos;My mother had insisted that I learn something useful, so I learnt to type. In the camp there were not so many people who spoke German and could do shorthand and type, so I was put into the administrative barracks. &apos;When the Germans came with Schindler&apos;s list of the workers that he wanted to take to Sudetenland [western Czechoslovakia] it was given to me to note and type up.&apos; That list was the group who came to be known as Schindler&apos;s Jews, 1,300 or so individuals that at first perhaps for financial motives, but later for increasingly humanitarian reasons, Schindler would defend with his often aggressive charm against the SS, sheltering them first in his enamel wares factory in Krakow, then, as the Russian front advanced, in a factory in Sudetenland making bullets. It was at this moment that Schindler and his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, who had helped to motivate Schindler, prepared the &apos;list&apos; of essential workers - all of them Jews - for relocation to his new factory. &apos;I was given the list to type up,&apos; recalled Reinhardt last week. &apos;And when I typed it up I put my name and the name of two friends on it to make up the quota.&apos; In doing so amid the accelerated extermination of Poland&apos;s Jews that was under way in 1944, she almost certainly saved all their lives. A perilous journey, including a stop-off in Auschwitz, followed before Schindler&apos;s Jews made it to his new factory in Brunnlitz. There, despite reservations about being in the office of the womanising and hard-drinking Schindler, Reinhardt was persuaded to work for him. She met Schindler only once after the war. &apos;It must have been around 1953. I had gone to Vienna and I was walking along a street with an uncle. We were passing a coffee house where there was a group of people sitting. This large man ran across and hugged and started kissing me, saying: &quot;Mimi, Mimi...&quot; It was then that I realised that it was Schindler sitting with some of the Jews he had rescued.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2007-12-09T23:45:48Z", "title": "Schindler typist adds her postscript", "sentences": ["Her arrival in Tel Aviv last week, announced by the Jewish Agency that encourages immigration to Israel, has seen Reinhardt lionised by the Israeli media and attaining an instant celebrity that has bewildered her, according to her son Sacha, but which she says the flamboyant Oskar Schindler himself would have thoroughly enjoyed.", "Speaking to The Observer last week from a hotel in Tel Aviv, where she plans to settle in sheltered accommodation close to her son and his family, Oskar Schindler&apos;s sometime secretary recalled the genesis of the list that would save so many lives, and her own part in it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/09/secondworldwar.germany"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The first formal Middle East peace negotiations in seven years got off to a tense start today with the Palestinian Authority demanding a halt to Israeli plans to build settlements on disputed territory.

We have agreed to meet again, nothing else,&quot; negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo told Reuters after the meeting in Jerusalem. Fellow Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat added: &quot;If you want to restore the credibility of the peace process, the Israeli government must revoke this order.&quot; An Israeli official criticised the Palestinians&apos; complaints, claiming they had cast a shadow over the negotiations. &quot;We really wanted to see it as a procedural meeting in good spirit. They created a tense atmosphere,&quot; he said. The Israelis, in turn, complained about ongoing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Militants fired 16 homemade rockets toward Israel early today, causing minor damage and slightly wounding one woman, Israeli officials said. Israel&apos;s army chief today warned that a large military offensive would be needed in Gaza to end the rocket attacks. Speaking at a conference in Tel Aviv on security issues, Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi said: &quot;We are operating in Gaza on a daily basis. Yesterday we returned from a broad operation (...) this brings a reduction in the ground threat and the firing of rockets but does not stop it. We will come to the point where we will have to carry out the big operation.&quot;  Ashkenazi&apos;s comments came a day after Israel mounted one of its biggest raids into Gaza since Hamas seized control in June, killing five militants and pushing tanks and armoured cars a mile into the territory. Troops withdrew early today to a buffer zone along the Israeli border. Ashkenazi said he believed that there was &quot;military value&quot; in repeated strikes on militants but that they probably could not be completely effective in stopping attacks against Israel.  Israel has been mulling a large-scale military operation in Gaza for months, but has made do with limited incursions and air strikes for fear of disrupting the new peace talks. Hamas, which routed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas&apos;s Fatah faction in Gaza, has rejected negotiation with Israel, and its grip on the territory could also complicate the new peace talks. The negotiations were the first since Israel and the Palestinian Authority formally restarted peace talks at an international conference last month in the United States.

In the spirit of a creative encounter between the graphic explorations of Leonardo Da Vinci and the architectural inventiveness of Buckminster Fuller, Pickering has built up a body of work out of the geometric Inversion Principle. From painstaking intersections of banal cardboard, plaster, acetate and steel wire, Pickering conjures architectural enchantments. These wonderful constructions deserve to be built, full size, and lived in. rc \u00b7 New Art Gallery, to Jan 27 Keren Cytter London This is the first exhibition for the Israeli film-maker Keren Cytter, an artist who creates dynamic portraits inspired by the trivial events of everyday life. Something Happened is a work based on Natalia Ginzburg&apos;s 1947 novel, \u00c8 Stato Cosi, and depicts two lovers arguing. The film swerves between a Hollywood love story and a behind-the-scenes documentary as the artist gets the couple to repeat their lines endlessly, echoing earlier art works by the legendary American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman. Born in Tel Aviv in 1977, Cytter studied in Israel and Amsterdam, where she is now based. jl \u00b7 Cubitt, N1, to Jan 6 Loner&apos;s Island Cardiff This exhibition, curated by art agency Mermaid And Monster, is for the alienated and footloose.Six artists washed up on Loner&apos;s Island offer their responses to this imaginary world.

Here it presents neon works by Fiona Banner, Alec Finlay, Richard Meitner and Vong Phaophanit. All four artists adapt neon&apos;s use in urban signage and advertising to a fine art agenda more inclined to enigmatic seductions. Neon is recognised for its haunting allure, its atmosphere of nocturnal writing on the wall. Fiona Banner simplifies neon&apos;s potential back to its calligraphic basics in an illumination of the 26 letters of the alphabet. In contrast, Vong Phaophanit presents Neon Rice Field (pictured), made for the Turner Prize exhibition of 1993. Reminiscent of the artist&apos;s origins in Laos, a former French colony bordering on Vietnam, the installation&apos;s unsettling neon resonance is half muted beneath a field of American long grain rice. rc \u00b7 National Glass Centre, to Mar 24 Pat Graham London Graham is best known as a chronicler of the indie scene in Washington DC in the early-90s. Shooting the likes of Royal Trux, Fugazi and touring with the Make-Up and Modest Mouse, Graham captured a gang of musicians as extreme in their performances as their politics. While on the road, he began to document the detached world of the peripatetic, overnight staying traveller. This exhibition coincides with the publication of a new book that charts the evolution of Washington&apos;s underground music scene, and Graham&apos;s candid images offer us unrestricted access to this world. From the euphoria of being onstage to the dingy motels and remote gas stations, it&apos;s as much a personal diary as a record of an era. jl \u00b7 Rough Trade East, E1, to Feb 1 Thomas Zipp London Black Sabbath provide inspiration for Thomas Zipp&apos;s new show Planet Caravan.

My parents embarrassed me in different ways. They were Hungarian immigrants in Los Angeles and they were nothing like my friends&apos; parents. Their accents were so thick and their mistakes so extreme. When buying our first car in America, my mother took advice from a friend who suggested she ask for a &quot;strip-down car&quot;, which meant no unnecessary extras. By the time she arrived at the car dealer&apos;s, &quot;strip down&quot; somehow turned into requesting a &quot;drop-dead car&quot;. It wasn&apos;t only their English that embarrassed me, but their terrible dress sense. It was the 1960s, and clothes had become wild, wonderful and colourful. To see my dad in high-waisted trousers when all the world seemed to be in hip-huggers was too much to bear. There were advantages, however. Whatever I wanted within reason, as long as I convinced them that it was normal in America, I got. &quot;Every kid in America has a pony,&quot; I insisted. Fred, my father, couldn&apos;t bear the possibility of not fitting in, and so bought me my first pony. I was a Jewish, urban cowgirl in the hills of the San Fernando Valley, far from the Jewish Hungarian lifestyle my parents understood, and it gave me tremendous freedom. My parents were survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. From an early age, I was aware of the traumas that happened &quot;over there&quot;, even though they were never spoken about. Somehow the experiences penetrated me through some inexplicable osmosis. My mother suffered constant anxiety; she worried that at any moment she could lose her family as quickly as she had lost her parents when arriving at Auschwitz. That dreaded separation point when those directed to the right went to the gas chambers and those to the left to the camps. Every moment in our lives was another potential separation point. Every morning when my sister and I went to school, and my father to work, my mother found herself back at the &quot;point&quot;. My father, seemingly less damaged by his experiences, responded to her anxiety with anger, and often retreated further into his business. Our story was similar to many immigrant families in the 60s. We had arrived in New York from Israel with $50 in our pockets. Someone told Fred about the possibilities in Washington DC. After trying and failing there, we headed for LA, where my parents found friends from their home towns in Europe. Families from concentration camps had few extended members, so we often collected together and created our own, with only a similar language and history to bind us. Fred worked as a lorry driver, studying at night until he became an accountant, and later a real-estate agent. Within no time he had bought a house, installed a swimming pool and joined the ranks of middle-class Jewish life in LA. My memories of him as I grew up are mainly of watching him reading the paper, listening to the news, and shouting in Hungarian. He and my mother argued a lot, but always in Hungarian, so the meaning of their rows was a mystery to me. He was relieved to have daughters rather than sons because, in his eyes, this meant he didn&apos;t really have to spend time playing with us. Although he was awkward in the role of a father, I never doubted his love for me, and I often ran to him for comfort, hoping he could put some sense into my mother&apos;s irrational outbursts. In his business dealings, he had great ambitions, but they often failed. One exception was a mobile-home park he built in Victorville, California. To mark his success, he named the streets after family members. There was Ruth Street, Alice Avenue, Fred Street and Naomi Avenue - our family, for ever remembered, on the road to Las Vegas. It wasn&apos;t a bad life, until his health started to deteriorate. Perhaps it was his experience in the Holocaust, the stress of a bad marriage, or just an unhealthy lifestyle. He smoked two to four packs of cigarettes a day, over-ate to the point of obesity, and found that he couldn&apos;t control his mood and temper. In his 40s, he had a massive heart attack. After quadruple bypass surgery, he gave up smoking and took up exercise, which involved walking around our swimming pool 120 times - he carried a counter to keep track. But slowly, his weight crept up again; he made some poor business decisions, and went bankrupt. The house with the swimming pool went and with it his American dream. He had another massive heart attack and was told he would not survive unless he checked into a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Whatever magic happened to him in those six weeks, Fred was never the same again. It took me years to recognise the man who emerged. The high-waisted trousers had been replaced by jeans and an &quot;I Love to Hug&quot; T-shirt. His hair and beard were long and grey. Suddenly, he wanted to embrace everyone; stress was the poison, and hugging was the medicine. Group therapy had changed his life. He didn&apos;t have to follow the American dream and chase the mighty dollar, he could give it all up and live his own dreams. So Fred announced he was divorcing Mum and became a health guru, a role that was to attract considerable media interest. Time magazine interviewed him for a cover story on cardiac rehabilitation, and he became America&apos;s role model for life after cardiac surgery, giving talks in local universities and on TV shows. We, his family, simply didn&apos;t recognise him. In his local beach community, someone must have mentioned that with his flowing beard and warm, rounded belly, he would make a good Santa Claus. He leapt at the offer, and was soon fitted out with a costume. Not just one for winter, which didn&apos;t exist in southern California, but a shorts and T-shirt option too, with surfboard accessories to match. He even changed his car licence plate to read &quot;H Santa&quot;, meaning Hungarian Santa. The rest of the family may have been bewildered by his transformation, but somewhere in all of this, I believe my father really did find himself. The compassion he felt towards children was real and deep, and in his new guise as Santa he was able to visit and entertain deprived children - the homeless, the terminally ill and the abused. He opened his heart to them and brought them moments of real joy. I, however, still could not forgive him the anguish he had caused my mother. Perhaps I was jealous that these children were getting the love I felt I had missed. But mainly I was confused. How could my father, a Jewish camp survivor who had lost his parents in the Holocaust, who participated in building the state of Israel, suddenly turn into the Christian mythological figure of Santa Claus? In his often-fabricated accounts of his life, the time from his deportation to Auschwitz to when he was standing next to the Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion in a military hospital in Tel Aviv, utterly vanished. I was furious. Then, in the mid 1980s, I moved to London and, with distance, our relationship began to heal. Instead of feeling anger, I began to feel grateful that this extraordinary man was my father, and I wanted to understand the magic he carried. Sadly, there was little time left. The phone call that children who live abroad from their parents fear the most came. Fred had suffered another heart attack and died. As all my grandparents were killed in the Holocaust, I had never before experienced a death. As a family, we had no idea even how to plan a funeral. Fred was not a religious man - indeed my sister and I had been brought up to scorn religion - but of course there would be a rabbi. Someone mentioned that he had wished to be cremated, and so that is what we did. It was only afterwards that I realised cremation was against Jewish law and I bitterly regretted turning my father to ashes after his parents had been burned in the gas chambers. All his friends and followers attended. I&apos;ll never forget the look on their faces when they arrived and discovered that Santa Claus was a Jew. They still wanted to remember him as they knew him best - by singing Christmas carols. So the Hungarian Jews and their offspring sailed off on a boat to scatter his ashes in the Pacific Ocean, off the coastline that brought him so much happiness, while the gentile community remembered Fred as they wanted to - with a good Christmas sing-song on a boat of their own. Years later, as I found myself desperate for extra income in order to fund my training as a psychotherapist, I became an entertainer at children&apos;s parties, dressed as a clown. Despite years of therapy and self-development, there was no mistaking it - I was becoming my father.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-15T23:57:02Z", "title": "First person: Naomi Shragai on her Jewish father's colourful history", "sentences": ["In his often-fabricated accounts of his life, the time from his deportation to Auschwitz to when he was standing next to the Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion in a military hospital in Tel Aviv, utterly vanished."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/15/familyandrelationships.family1"}, {"tags": ["Comedy", "Stage", "Culture", "Judaism"], "article": "As far as we know, Lenny Bruce never had sex with an Orthodox Jew, but if he had he would have produced Yisrael Campbell. The child of this improbable union is sweating on stage before me, underneath the 18th-century robes and black hat of a true believer. But he is quipping, not praying. &quot;I could do this routine in Hebrew,&quot; he says with a self- deprecating wince, &quot;but it would be 35 words long.&quot; He plays with his long black side-curls - &quot;They&apos;re the beginning of a comb-over&quot; - and follows the rhythm of Jewish comedians everywhere. He starts with a whisper, then he waggles his arms, grins and soars up to a shout. &quot;The Nazi Pope!&quot; he announces. &quot;Oh yeah, they say he quit the German army in 1945. Hitler quit the German army in 1945 - 1945 was a bad a year to be in the German army.&quot; Sitting backstage, staring into the eyes of this calm 44-year-old, I realise why this is, for him, an important joke. Yisrael&apos;s real punchline is that he grew up a Catholic in 1960s Philadelphia. &quot;I hated it because nothing ever happened there,&quot; he says. &quot;So I moved to Jerusalem, where too much happens.&quot; When I first heard this, I couldn&apos;t believe it. I have been a Jew all my life, and pride myself on my impeccable Jewdar. And this man is as Jewish as anyone I have ever seen. It is not just his outfit: it is his face. He looks so Jewish. He talks so Jewish. He is so Jewish. How is it possible he was born into another world? &quot;I&apos;m the first-born son of a manic-depressive Italian woman and a pathologically silent Irishman,&quot; he explains. &quot;This makes me wildly emotional ... in a very quiet way. My aunt is a nun. Which makes Jesus my uncle.&quot; He slugs back a Coke. &quot;But I was Catholic enough to know I was going to hell.&quot; Before she gave birth to Yisrael, or Chris, as he was known then, his mother had a crisis of faith. She entered a convent, and she &quot;saw the wizard behind the screen&quot;, the mechanics of Catholicism behind the spirituality. &quot;She was angry with God, she was angry with the Pope. She left the faith and she never found a spiritual solution.&quot; So he grew up with a pathologically furious mother raging at the non-existence of God - she sounds oddly Jewish too. His first religious experience was alcohol. Campbell was 13 when he took his first communion in beer. &quot;It was my own spiritual crisis,&quot; he says. &quot;What I was searching for in alcohol and drugs,&quot; he says, &quot;was what I found in religion.&quot; After he had dried out and moved to Los Angeles, where he was trying to become an actor, a girlfriend handed him a copy of Leon Uris&apos;s novel Exodus. It is the story of the founding of the Jewish state, told through rose-tinted spectacles. He clutched it and &quot;had visions of waiting while a beautiful woman with long dark hair rode towards me on a horse. I had fantasies of plucking avocados out of the earth. I didn&apos;t know they grew on trees.&quot; So he replaced his addiction to alcohol with an addiction to God. Over the next 10 years he skated from liberal Reform Judaism to Conservative Judaism to Orthodox Judaism - or, as the Orthodox describe this trajectory, wrong-wrong-right. He told his mother recently that he is thinking of becoming a rabbi. &quot;You&apos;ll do anything to avoid getting a proper job,&quot; she told him. He began to churn through rabbis, finding he quickly tired of them: they never offered enough ritual. He was circumcised four times. The first time was as a baby, when his foreskin was cut away. Then each time he upgraded to a new level of Judaism they insisted on ritual bloodletting of the penis. &quot;Four times isn&apos;t a religious ritual,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s a fetish.&quot; Orthodox Jews often ritually cleanse themselves in a pool of water called a mikvah. Yisrael&apos;s first mikvah was the palatial pool in Bel Air. &quot;They didn&apos;t have a wave machine, but you could see where they would put it if they did.&quot; When he followed the Zionist Yellow Brick Road to Israel seven years ago, he discovered the Bel Air mikvah had been heaven. &quot;The Jerusalem mikvah is full of big fat hairy Jews, and you can wait for them to get out but there&apos;s no point because more will come in. So I go in and I say my prayer. My prayer is, &apos;Please don&apos;t let them touch me. And don&apos;t let me touch them.&apos;&quot; His other major problem in Israel has been the response of the El Al check-in desk to a man dressed as an Orthodox Jew whose passport was in the name of Chris Campbell. &quot;They didn&apos;t ask to check my luggage,&quot; he says. &quot;They asked me where the bomb was.&quot; So he changed his name to Yisrael and formed a comedy troupe called the Israel-Palestinian Comedy Tour. It was a rag-tag army of two other Jews (one a black convert) and a Palestinian called Ray Hanania, who announces at the start of their act: &quot;I don&apos;t think of you as an audience, I think of you as potential hostages.&quot; When the tour began in January, they were the closest thing the Middle East had to a peace process. Hanania would stand on stage and say, &quot;My friend wants to know why we&apos;re not playing occupied Palestine. I say - I&apos;m in Tel Aviv, it is occupied Palestine.&quot; Then Campbell launched on to the stage and prodded Hanania in the chest. Hanania prodded back, and they fell to the floor while the compere declared, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you have enjoyed the show.&quot; He really has acquired the manner of an Orthodox Jew: he shakes my hand, but warily - Orthodox Jews don&apos;t shake strange women&apos;s hands because the Bible forbids &quot;endearing contact&quot; between strangers - and only because he doesn&apos;t want to embarrass me, he admits later. He has that fixed, distant beneficence of a man of God. I tell him I&apos;m a mamzer, the product of a forbidden relationship - to the Orthodox, I am an outcast because my grandmother did not divorce her first husband in Jewish law before she married my grandfather. I am not allowed to marry an Orthodox Jew, and neither are any of my descendants. He looks at me and - with genuine pity and horror, as if he can see my soul floating off in a bubble - he says, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; And he sits there, remote as a distant planet under his hat, a serene smile on his face. The gags have fled. I yearn to have Lenny back. Campbell is no fun off-stage. As he talks on in sentences soaked in Orthodox platitude, I think back to his routine. &quot;Do you remember when the Israeli army killed a Hamas bomb-maker? He has one arm and no legs. If you went to master bomb- making class and the teacher had one arm and no legs, wouldn&apos;t you want to defer?&quot; And with that thought, he ambles out the door and back to Israel - where he is pursuing his strange, successful dream of being more Jewish than the Jews. \u00b7 You can hear Yisrael Campbell on the Guardian&apos;s monthly podcast, Sounds Jewish at theguardian.com/podcasts", "publicationDate": "2007-12-17T10:22:50Z", "title": "Yisrael Campbell is not your average Orthodox Jewish comedian", "sentences": ["I say - I&apos;m in Tel Aviv, it is occupied Palestine.&quot; Then Campbell launched on to the stage and prodded Hanania in the chest."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/dec/17/comedy"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Defying the stares of the disapproving masses, I bravely read the Guardian from cover to cover en route from London to Tel Aviv last week - including Ahmad Samih Khalidi&apos;s weighty critique of the post-Annapolis situation. In his piece, he took aim at Ehud Olmert&apos;s apparent attempts to force the Palestinians to &quot;give up their history&quot;, by encouraging them to settle for a two-state solution rather than allowing them the right of return to Israel. While there is no denying his logic, by focusing merely on the Palestinians&apos; aspirations to return to their land there is an implicit suggestion that the right to live in Israel is something that only the Palestinians are entitled to. If ever there is a time and place to counter this opinion, it is on a flight into Ben Gurion airport, witnessing the unchecked anticipation and excitement of the Jewish passengers as the plane touches down on the tarmac. There is a palpable sense of joy as the pilot taxis along the runway, as spontaneous applause breaks out, and the more exuberant on board begin impromptu singing of Hava Negila. So it was last Thursday, and - as the &quot;leftwing by Israeli standards&quot; man next to me remarked - it&apos;s because &quot;this is our land, after all&quot;. According to him, &quot;the only proof we have is that it says so in the Torah&quot;, but that is enough to convince him that relinquishing control over the territory is anathemic to the survival of the Jewish people. Once I&apos;d collected my luggage and boarded a sherut to Jerusalem, I was treated to a similar view by a particularly over-excited American man in his 40s. It was clear from the off where he stood politically, after we passed an army jeep and he forcibly swivelled his young son&apos;s head towards it, shouting: &quot;Look, look, look - there&apos;re our boys, God bless &apos;em.&quot; He repeated the trick as we caught sight of the security wall for the first time. &quot;That&apos;s what Ariel Sharon built to keep us from being blown up by the Palestinians,&quot; he informed his son proudly. Turning to me, he asked if it was my first time in the country, clearly looking to impart some of his wisdom to as wide an audience as possible. I casually remarked that I&apos;d served in the army, assuming that such an admission would be the best lubricant to grease the wheels of our acquaintance. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;, he cried to his son. &quot;This boy&apos;s a hero too! He did God&apos;s will by fighting against the dark Nazis for us.&quot; &quot;Who are the dark Nazis?&quot;, I inquired, though it was clear what he meant. &quot;That&apos;s what I call the Palestinians,&quot; he replied smugly, evidently delighted with the epithet he&apos;d conjured up for our neighbours. &quot;I mean, I know they&apos;re not all dark, but it sums them up pretty well otherwise.&quot; I observed that they weren&apos;t all Nazis either, but was too late to stem the inevitable tide that poured forth from his lips now that he was in full flow. After a week in the relative calm of London, his diatribe was a sobering reminder of the aggression and passion that courses through the veins of those with even the most tenuous of links to this troubled region. My new friend hailed from Atlanta (&quot;though I&apos;m desperately trying to convince my wife that we should move here&quot;), and relied on a heavy ratio of cliches to reason in order to overrule any objections I made to his shaky logic. &quot;They&apos;re all animals,&quot; he assured me, after I&apos;d opined that perhaps the violence wasn&apos;t a one-way street as he&apos;d liked me to have believed. &quot;In fact, they&apos;re worse than animals, since animals only kill in order to eat.&quot; I asked if that meant he could never get on with Palestinians himself. &quot;If you were an Arab,&quot; he replied, with pleading eyes, &quot;I&apos;d beg you to stop hating me just because I&apos;m a Jew. The problem is that they&apos;re all taught to hate us from the minute they&apos;re born, and nothing we can say will convince them otherwise.&quot; I asked whether he could see a similarity in their supposed blanket hatred of us, and his definite generalisations about them - but, unsurprisingly, he couldn&apos;t. &quot;Look, I don&apos;t hate them - I just don&apos;t want to be a victim. I don&apos;t want them to chop my head off.&quot; Getting beheaded was evidently a major concern to him, as he worked the &quot;head chopping&quot; scenario into a further three doomsday scenarios that he painted on my behalf. In the 20 minutes that followed, he managed to dismiss the UN as &quot;the children of the people who tossed us into the gas chambers&quot;, accused Muhammad of &quot;twisting the Torah in order to steal the land from us&quot;, as well as assured me that Jewish extremists &quot;are not following God&apos;s word, so they&apos;re not really our problem&quot;. As the driver pulled up to his stop, he gave me a personalised blessing &quot;that God should protect you when you encounter those savages&quot;, before bidding me goodbye and stepping out into the Jerusalem night. As I digested his words - which were neither unique nor particularly unexpected - I realised that, love it or hate it, the man&apos;s devotion to the concept of a Jewish state in Israel is every bit as tangible as that of his Palestinian counterparts. While I abhor many of the sentiments he expressed - just as I similarly despise the rhetoric of the extremist Palestinians - there is no doubting that his claim to the land is no simpler to dismiss just because it is based on an earlier period of history than that of the Palestinians. And, from the commenters on Cif to the likes of Ahmad Samih Khalidi and beyond, there must be a collective realisation that if Israelis are expected to take the Palestinians&apos; yearning to return seriously, then so too must they respect the desires of the Jews both in Israel and in the Diaspora. To do otherwise is, to paraphrase Khalidi, &quot;to demand that the Jews give up their history&quot; - and to go down that route is as unconscionable as forcing the Palestinians to do the same.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-18T07:00:00Z", "title": "Two sides to every history", "sentences": ["Defying the stares of the disapproving masses, I bravely read the Guardian from cover to cover en route from London to Tel Aviv last week - including Ahmad Samih Khalidi&apos;s weighty critique of the post-Annapolis situation."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/18/twosidestoeveryhistory"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Half way along the route from my house and the town centre, the bus approaches the walls of the Old City before swinging sharply to the left and heading up Jaffa Road. As it veers round the corner, the spot we call &quot;the edge of the world&quot; comes into view - the invisible divide between East and West Jerusalem, which effectively marks the city limits of the Jewish part of town. Barely any Jew has reason to venture beyond the junction, since - whatever the diehard nationalists claim - Jerusalem is a divided city already, in all but name. Which is why there really is no good reason for Israel to continue to hold on to the Arab half of the city, especially given the mileage the government would gain from relinquishing their grasp. The political significance of acceding to Palestinian demands to hand over half of Jerusalem would mark a watershed moment in relations between the two peoples, and provide enough momentum to carry peace negotiations to previously uncharted waters. Not that we should be motivated by political manoeuvring alone. As a friend of mine commented while we ate lunch near the Kotel (Western Wall): &quot;We ought to be proud to give the Palestinians their half of the city, so that they can experience the same joy at gaining their spiritual capital that we did in &apos;67.&quot; In his eyes, not only would we be &quot;lifting a great weight from our own shoulders&quot;, but also bestowing on the Palestinians the same gift of pride and self-worth that so inspired the Israeli public when Jerusalem was conquered 40 years ago. Anyone with a real desire to grant the Palestinians a viable, independent state is all too aware that East Jerusalem must be included in the package, if there is to be any chance of a successful resolution. Just as Israeli Jews didn&apos;t feel their country was complete until the Old City was captured in the six-day war, so too will the Palestinians feel eternally short-changed if they are expected to live in a state that doesn&apos;t have East Jerusalem as its capital. However, even in what some describe as the post-Annapolis state of optimism, the issue of dividing Jerusalem is still an incredibly thorny one - to Israelis, at least. According to the November peace index published by Tel Aviv University, 39% of Israelis interviewed saw Jerusalem as the most difficult hurdle to overcome in the quest for peace between the two camps. Although this figure has declined considerably since 1999 (when it stood at 57%), there is no denying that decades of nationalist propagandising has left a significant impact on Israeli psyches when it comes to the prospect of carving up the holy city. But, while many Israelis are happy to let their hearts rule their heads, the plain facts are that East Jerusalem is of no importance whatsoever in either practical or religious terms. As Ruth Meisels pointed out in Friday&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz, &quot;there is no commandment mandating Jewish political sovereignty in Jerusalem&quot;. Just because the orthodox have adopted Jerusalem as a symbol of Jewish independence and autonomy, does not mean that the rest of the country should be duped into believing the hype. Jerusalem is no more required to be under Jewish control than Herzliya or Tel Aviv, as far as the Bible is concerned. Therefore, given the potential for reconciliation with our Palestinian neighbours by agreeing to share control of the city, it takes a particularly hard heart to demand that not one inch of Jerusalem is ceded in the interests of peace. Whether we like it or not, the only way forward in the search for true harmony is to treat the Palestinians as equals when it comes to negotiations, and that means acknowledging that their claims to Jerusalem are just as worthy as our own. Consenting to such a deal doesn&apos;t have to mean that the we revert to the pre-1967 situation, when Jews were all but denied access to the Western Wall. As I wrote in June, the Kotel is the focal point of world Jewry, and consequently we can never allow it to become off-limits again to those who wish to pray there. But that stipulation doesn&apos;t preclude the possibility of turning the Old City into an international protectorate, where Jews and Muslims alike would be able to roam unimpeded. If that were to happen, the rest of the puzzle would fall into place pretty easily. The area lying to the east of the Old City, which is all but entirely Palestinian, should be handed over to serve as capital of the new Palestinian entity, whilst all that lies to the west would remain under Jewish control. And then, in the conciliatory climate that would inevitably follow such a move, perhaps the world would finally recognise West Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital - something it has understandably refused to do until now. Until the issue of Jerusalem is resolved fairly, there is little chance of any of the post-Annapolis green shoots thriving and producing any kind of worthwhile harvest. The Palestinians have said as much, and - along with the refugee dilemma - there is no way that any Palestinian leader can be expected to deliver peace without having brought his people an honourable resolution to the problem. And, painful as it may be to admit, the Israelis know that if they are to ever do justice to their downtrodden neighbours, they will have to part with much of their beloved city. To not do so will mean prolonging the conflict for another half century and another two or three generations - and that would be far too heavy a price to pay just to protract the myth that Jerusalem is &quot;united&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T08:00:00Z", "title": "A tale of two cities", "sentences": ["According to the November peace index published by Tel Aviv University, 39% of Israelis interviewed saw Jerusalem as the most difficult hurdle to overcome in the quest for peace between the two camps.", "Jerusalem is no more required to be under Jewish control than Herzliya or Tel Aviv, as far as the Bible is concerned."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/21/ataleoftwocities"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Airline industry", "Transport"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday January 3 2008  Newcastle airport is not owned by BAA and so would not have been affected by strikes planned for this month as we suggested in the article below. The seven UK airports operated by BAA are Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Southampton and Aberdeen. This has been corrected.   More than 1 million air passengers face a miserable start to the new year after staff at Britain&apos;s largest airport owner voted for a wave of strikes next month. BAA runs Heathrow and Gatwick plus five other UK airports, which it will shut if unions go ahead with planned 24-hour walkouts from 6am on January 7 and 14, followed by a 48-hour strike on January 17. The industrial action will affect at least 1.3 million passengers, who will either have to book flights from alternative airports or journey by other means, while travel from BAA airports will also be disrupted on the days immediately after the strikes. Unite represents 5,800 BAA staff, and the union called the strikes because the airport group closed its final salary pension scheme to new entrants. Brendan Gold, Unite&apos;s national aviation secretary, said: &quot;Without doubt, in my view, it will result in the closure of those seven airports during that timeframe [and cause] a huge amount of disruption.&quot; BAA was holding out for an amicable solution to the dispute yesterday and asked for the &quot;understanding of passengers&quot; as it continued talks with union representatives. British Airways, BAA&apos;s largest airline, told travellers not to cancel bookings: &quot;We are speaking to BAA to understand its operational contingency plans if industrial action goes ahead. We have not cancelled any flights at this stage, and therefore we aim to operate as normal.&quot; However, the world&apos;s busiest international airport, Heathrow, will close if the strikes take place. The majority of staff who voted to strike are deployed on security checkpoints, plus firefighters whose presence is mandatory in an airport. It is expected BAA will be unable to recruit auxiliary guards or firefighters from the army - an idea mooted during the airport security crackdown in 2006 - because they are not trained to use x-ray machines or to handle civilian aircraft. BAA&apos;s other UK airports are: Stansted, Southampton, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Its terminals account for nearly two-thirds of all airport arrivals and departures in the UK. The Association of British Travel Agents said that it would work with airlines to ensure that holidaymakers got to their destinations. An ABTA spokeswoman said: &quot;Other non-BAA airports such as Luton, Birmingham and Manchester may be able to help out.&quot; A January walkout will be the latest in a list of setbacks for BAA. It has struggled to recover from the disruption of the alleged liquid bomb plot in August last year, which cause a security clampdown which brought its biggest airports, including Heathrow, to a standstill. Unite blamed BAA&apos;s Spanish owner, Ferrovial, for the dispute yesterday. Gold said BAA executives wanted to avoid strikes but were &quot;dictated to&quot; by Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino, who oversaw the \u00a310.3bn takeover of BAA last year and is attempting to refinance the company&apos;s \u00a39bn debts. &quot;They have bought the business and they are trying to screw the money out of it,&quot; said Gold. BAA has assured government ministers that the decision to close the final salary pension scheme to newcomers was arrived at independently by its board, which includes three Ferrovial representatives. A Ferrovial spokesman said that the pension move was a &quot;BAA decision&quot;. Gold said BAA could easily afford to finance its pension scheme and defended the size of its strike mandate, which saw a third of BAA&apos;s Unite staff backing a strike on a 53% turnout. The British Chamber of Commerce said the strikes would be a dreadful start for the economy in 2008, and cost millions of pounds at a time when the UK needed to &quot;pull together&quot; to avert an economic downturn. &quot;The reputation of our airports in the eyes of international travellers will be further diminished when travellers get to the UK and are met by chaos,&quot; said David Frost, BCC director general. Staff will be joined on strike by members of the PCS union, which represents managerial staff at BAA. Cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic are staging separate 48-hour walkouts on January 9 and January 16, which will ground 10% of the airline&apos;s flights. Other options Airports not affected by the strike include: East Midlands Flights to Acapulco, Gambia, Bratislava, Jersey, Norway, Tunisia as well as many European cities.

In Mary and Joseph&apos;s day, accommodation was a major headache in Bethlehem, but thanks to Swedish ingenuity those problems are behind us. To be honest, getting hold of a bed took more than Swedish ingenuity. There was a fair amount of Palestinian ingenuity involved, too. The nearest Ikea store is in Tel Aviv, some 50 miles from Bethlehem and, more pertinently, on the other side of a large concrete wall. According to the Israeli government, the wall was built solely to prevent Palestinians moving at will between Palestine and Israel. Without doubt, driving a removal van from Bethlehem to Tel Aviv and back again - with a kingsize bed, a double mattress, two bedside cabinets, a small chest of drawers and a pair of Ikea slippers - took some ingenious planning and quite a bit of expense. But it was far from insuperable. Would one really expect a group of Palestinian DIY enthusiasts to show more cunning and dedication than a militant terrorist cell? If the Ikea trip demonstrated anything, it is that the wall has nothing much to do with security. In saying this, I am not simply echoing the views of my Palestinian neighbours or the international court of justice, two groups that Israelis instinctively mistrust. The wall is ineffective as a security measure because it is not finished. Nor will it be finished, as long as there are Israeli settlers and soldiers on the &quot;wrong&quot; side. On our trip to Ikea, we took the roads that the settlers and the army use as they move back and forth between Palestine and Israel. Those who defend the wall as a security measure point to the complete cessation of suicide bombings since construction began. But this is tantamount to arguing that it was the idea of the wall that stopped terrorism, rather than the wall itself, or that imaginary security measures are as effective as real security measures. Terrorism against Israel ended as a result of a combination of factors. The election of a Palestinian president who rejected both armed struggle and terrorism, played a key part. Israeli army actions also played a role. The Israeli army is now in Palestine in far higher numbers than at any point during the occupation. The army currently operates 500 military checkpoints, and it is these that help make the wall look like a success. It is a con trick, and an expensive one. Some Israelis have blamed the army&apos;s poor performance in the last Lebanese war on the investment of manpower in the occupation. They argue that the army needs to spend more time training for Hizbullah, rather than policing an unarmed or lightly-armed Palestinian population. This is the catch-22 of the wall; it was supposed to release Israel from the burden of occupation, but instead it radically increased it. And still, we can travel from Bethlehem to Ikea, if we try hard enough. The 500 checkpoints make traffic between Palestinian cities as tortuous as our trip to Ikea. As a result, it is all but impossible to consider travelling to look for work or go to college, let alone run a business. This is the catch-22, squared. Israel&apos;s security also depends upon a sympathetic Palestinian government, but support for Abu Mazen&apos;s government depends upon the easing of Israel&apos;s restrictions. The longer the roadblock regime stays in place, the more chance that his government will fall and a new security threat will emerge, such as the Qassam rocket campaign being waged from Gaza. The wall has become a white elephant, so why does Israel remain wedded to it? Surely not for fear of looking stupid, having put so much time and expense into it? Most Israelis I speak to agree that the wall was never solely about security; it always had a dual role. It was conceived during the high watermark of Ariel Sharon&apos;s premiership and was a key piece of his plan to determine Israel&apos;s final borders by diktat. Today, Israelis accept that any hope of resuscitating the Sharon plan is as likely as resuscitating its author. But the wall is still with us, sketching an idea for a border that Israel no longer has confidence in, while failing to keep the determined Palestinian from their flat-pack furniture.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-22T16:00:00Z", "title": "The West Bank: flat-pack gridlock", "sentences": ["The nearest Ikea store is in Tel Aviv, some 50 miles from Bethlehem and, more pertinently, on the other side of a large concrete wall.", "Without doubt, driving a removal van from Bethlehem to Tel Aviv and back again - with a kingsize bed, a double mattress, two bedside cabinets, a small chest of drawers and a pair of Ikea slippers - took some ingenious planning and quite a bit of expense."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/22/thewestbankflatpackgridlo"}, {"tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "On the outskirts of Tel Aviv sits a sprawling mini-city, home to the largest medical centre in the Middle East. It has its own shopping mall, hotel and expansive fields. There are beds for 1,700 patients in dozens of different buildings across the 60-hectare site. Here, in a private room at the Sheba Medical Centre, lies Ariel Sharon, that most maverick of Israel&apos;s generals and politicians, a man who did so much to shape his country&apos;s past and future and who today remains in a long-term coma after a massive stroke two years ago. His room is guarded by two plain-clothes agents from the Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s internal security agency. He remains unconscious and is being fed artificially but although he is attached to a respirator, his friends say he is breathing on his own. Two years ago this month, at the age of 77, Sharon suffered a minor stroke. He was taken to hospital, was treated and went home. He seemed to recover and remained in office, but three weeks later, the night before he was due to go in for a heart procedure, he collapsed with a much larger stroke. &quot;It was a total shock. He was nearly 78 but we never considered him an old man,&quot; said Dov Weissglas, a Tel Aviv lawyer who has known Sharon as a close friend for many years. Sharon had had a cerebral haemorrhage and never regained consciousness. He underwent several operations at a Jerusalem hospital before he was transferred in May 2006 to the Sheba Medical Centre. In the months that followed he was twice rushed to the intensive care unit, once with pneumonia in his lungs, then with an infection affecting his heart. But each time he recovered and was allowed back to his room, where special nurses are on duty day and night. The bill, at 1,600 shekels (\u00a3200) a day, is reportedly met by the state. His doctors will not talk about his case but in a brief statement the hospital appeared to suggest there were signs of hope. It said that Sharon&apos;s medical condition had not changed dramatically since he was admitted but added: &quot;He was not in a deep coma on his admission and throughout this period there have been some signs of response to several kinds of stimuli.&quot; There is only a very small group who visit Sharon, partly to avoid the risk of infection. But nearly every day someone attends: his sons Omri and Gilad, Gilad&apos;s wife, Inbal, or a select few others. Sometimes they play music, or read to him. Among them is Reuven Adler, an advertising executive who has known Sharon for more than 30 years and who was instrumental in remoulding his public image ahead of his 2001 election victory. &quot;His children and the doctors who are treating him see different signs that he is aware, that he knows what is going on,&quot; said Adler. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to tell if he listens, if he sees. They tell me: &apos;We saw an improvement today&apos; or &apos;He reacted fantastically today.&apos; Now, the two sons are very serious guys. They are not imagining these things.&quot; Although connected to the machines around him, Sharon is not relying on them to stay alive and so, his friends say, there is no question of taking a decision to end his life. &quot;He is breathing spontaneously, not on a respirator,&quot; said Weissglas. &quot;If you disconnect him from the feeding machine it means he would die slowly out of hunger and thirst - no one on earth will do it. He is very much alive in terms of somebody who is in a coma.&quot; Weissglas meets regularly with Sharon&apos;s sons. He too is struck by their conviction that Sharon might recover. &quot;We are aware of stories of people who woke up after a year, two years, 10 years, 20 years,&quot; said Weissglas. &quot;His family are so healthy in their attitudes. They deeply believe that a day will come and one of the zillion miracles that do happen in this region will happen with him. That&apos;s all.&quot; However tough and controversial Sharon appeared in public, in private he commanded fierce loyalty, even from those who disagreed with him. Marit Danon had been the personal secretary to Israeli prime ministers going back more than a decade. &quot;When he was elected I was terrified because my political views are on the other side,&quot; Danon said. &quot;He seemed a very tough person.&quot; Yet Ehud Barak, Sharon&apos;s predecessor, convinced her to stay and she became one of Sharon&apos;s most loyal assistants, working long hours, talking to him as a friend, but always referring to him as &apos;Prime Minister.&apos; For three months after Sharon&apos;s collapse, Danon and another colleague went to his ranch in the Negev and spent nine hours a day cataloguing his papers, letters and papers from the army stretching back more than 60 years. Danon, who now heads the Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women, last saw Sharon when he left his office mid-afternoon on January 4, a few hours before his second stroke. &quot;I don&apos;t want to see him in hospital because I don&apos;t want my last memory of him to be of a person on a bed,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to remember him as strong, very confident and very funny - he had a great sense of humour. &quot;The fact that he is in a long-term coma is for us and for me personally much more difficult,&quot; she said. &quot;On one level he is absent and we miss him. He is not here with us. And on the other side he is still alive.&quot; Little has been said or heard of the former premier for months and yet, because he clings to life, there have been no formal ceremonies to mark his passing. None except an unusual commemoration granted at a modest opening ceremony two months ago when a vast former landfill site on the edge of Tel Aviv was renamed Ariel Sharon Park. Here, sandwiched between the commuter traffic on two of Israel&apos;s busiest highways, is a low, flat-topped hill of decaying garbage covered in soil and the occasional tree. An ambitious regeneration project, once championed by Sharon, will one day turn the site into a reclaimed natural wilderness and ecological study centre, a patch of green three times the size of Regent&apos;s Park in London. It is a most unexpected memorial for the iconoclastic hardliner and comes at a time when his legacy is still fiercely debated by Israelis. The public knew Sharon as the self-styled &quot;warrior&quot; general, a hard man who had fought in all of Israel&apos;s wars: he was injured in 1948, fought again in 1967, emerged a hero from the near-disastrous 1973 Yom Kippur war and was then forced to resign as defence minister in 1982, after being found indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in Beirut. But in the summer of 2005, Sharon surprised left and right when as prime minister he withdrew Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. His collapse a few months later brought to an end what was a dramatic but only half-completed strategy for resolving this most intractable conflict. &quot;It&apos;s like a movie, and at the most dramatic moment suddenly you get a sign saying &apos;The End&apos; and the music starts,&quot; said Adler. According to Sharon&apos;s vision, Israel would unilaterally impose its own borders with the Palestinians, giving up the settlements in Gaza in order to avoid compromising on the most sensitive issues for Israel: the desire to retain the whole of Jerusalem, to prevent Palestinian refugees ever returning to Israel and to hold on to the largest settlements in the occupied West Bank. Yet much has changed while Sharon has been in hospital. First Israel launched another war in Lebanon, attacking Hizbullah after two Israeli soldiers were captured in a cross-border ambush. The war was widely regarded as a failure in Israel because Hizbullah seemed to have survived largely intact. At the same time there were continued rocket attacks from Palestinian militants in Gaza, which Israel tried to suppress with a series of tough military incursions that left hundreds of Palestinians dead but failed to stop the rockets. Not long after, Hamas, the Islamist group that had won Palestinian elections, went on to seize full control of Gaza. The lesson of Lebanon and Gaza appeared to discredit the idea of unilateral withdrawals and for months the Israeli government, led by his former deputy, Ehud Olmert, seemed directionless. Just in the past few weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have returned to negotiations for the first time in seven years. But few expect this new rush of diplomacy will lead anywhere. Weissglas, who was closely involved in working out Sharon&apos;s strategy, argues the &quot;disengagement&quot; from Gaza was pragmatic. The warrior general had realised the only way to hold on to most of the prized Jewish settlements in the West Bank was to give up the dream of settling all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan. &quot;He used to say to us sometimes that he believed he was the last Israeli politician who could turn back to his public and say: &apos;Listen, we had a dream. What we managed to accomplish we did. What we did not, apparently we will not and that&apos;s it,&apos;&quot; said Weissglas. What may be recognised as Sharon&apos;s most important achievements is a letter of less than 1,000 words sent to him by President George Bush in April 2004, which in effect said Washington would let Israel keep its major West Bank settlement blocs, home to more than 100,000 settlers, in any final agreement with the Palestinians. &quot;At the end the overriding consideration would be safeguarding the future of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel for generations to come,&quot; said Eyal Arad, another friend who worked with Sharon when he was prime minister. &quot;There was a realisation that the dream that we can hold on to the entire Land of Israel is an objective that cannot be realised in this generation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-12-22T23:48:00Z", "title": "Is Israel still waiting for Ariel Sharon to wake up?", "sentences": ["On the outskirts of Tel Aviv sits a sprawling mini-city, home to the largest medical centre in the Middle East.", "He was nearly 78 but we never considered him an old man,&quot; said Dov Weissglas, a Tel Aviv lawyer who has known Sharon as a close friend for many years.", "None except an unusual commemoration granted at a modest opening ceremony two months ago when a vast former landfill site on the edge of Tel Aviv was renamed Ariel Sharon Park."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/22/israelandthepalestinians.mainsection"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "At Friday night dinner a week ago, the conversation inevitably turned to politics, and the table split neatly into two camps across generational lines.

That&apos;s just the way the brain works.&quot; With that in mind, there is something even more unusual about Combatants for Peace (CFP) than first meets the eye. The group is, as its name suggests, made up of ex-soldiers and ex-militants who have come together in search of the elusive grail of peace - and they take their message to the streets, as I found out last week. CFP had convened a meeting in Tel Aviv&apos;s Secular Yeshiva, bringing their campaign to the attention of a group of pre-army teens who study there voluntarily, having completed high school. Sitting in a large circle in a classroom, with the sounds of downtown Tel Aviv threatening to drown out the proceedings, the students spent two hours enthralled by the stories of war and peace being told. Two ex-combat soldiers sat alongside an ex-Fatah militiaman, and waxed lyrical about their own personal journeys from being teenage fighters to grown-up peacemakers. The session seemed to be as much for the benefit of the speakers as for the audience, as they exorcised their demons by speaking out about the violence and aggression that had blighted their formative years. Itamar Shapira, a 27-year-old Israeli who demobbed six years ago, spoke of the mental torment he&apos;s suffered ever since rejoining civilian life. After a fraught tour of duty - including participation in the notorious Operation Defensive Shield - he spent a year in &quot;blackout&quot;, using drugs and alcohol as an escape from the memories of what he&apos;d experienced during his service. &quot;It can send you crazy,&quot; he stated flatly, hollow eyes trained on the middle distance. &quot;You ask yourself &apos;who am I to have killed someone?&apos; and you even start to question what Zionism is about at all.&quot; As though participating in a truth and reconciliation commission, he spared the hushed room no detail about the grisly action that he saw during his spell on the front line. His lurid descriptions of opening fire on a jeepful of suspected terrorists was chilling - but was only half the story that he was trying to convey. He wanted the students to understand that, while in the short term their counter-terrorist actions may have seemed successful, in the bigger picture all of their efforts were in vain when it comes to ending the cycle of violence. &quot;You go to catch a bomber,&quot; he said, &quot;and during the mission someone unconnected starts shooting at your squad. So we respond and kill him, and then a week later there&apos;s another bombing, and it turns out to be the brother of the man we shot. And so it goes on [dragging more and more people into the fray].&quot; He was instrumental in founding CFP, hoping to redress some of the damage that the conflict had wreaked both on his own psyche as well as the others who had shared similar experiences. Usama, a stocky middle-aged Palestinian from Ramallah, is one such person who fits the description. After being arrested for &quot;throwing rocks and Molotovs&quot; in the first intifada, he spent three years in jail, finally being released at the age of 17. &quot;I grew up fast,&quot; he said. &quot;It was such a harsh punishment for someone of that age - when I was released I felt like I was already a man of 25.&quot; By the time the second intifada erupted, he&apos;d decided that non-violence was the only route to bring peace to his people, and opted not to take part in the uprising. However, he then began to feel that &quot;it was not enough just to abstain from violence - I had to be part of the peaceful solution as well&quot;. He attended the first meetings of the embryonic CFP, and gradually came to be an integral member of the organisation. While optimistic about the work that CFP do, he admitted that there is much work to be done convincing fellow Palestinians of the group&apos;s worth, &quot;since many don&apos;t believe in peace groups at all, as a result of years of occupation&quot; (a sentiment I&apos;ve heard expressed several times lately). Once the speeches were over, the students piled in with their questions, eager to glean as much from the speakers as possible in the hour they had left. &quot;Where&apos;s the anger gone after your jailing?&quot;, &quot;How can we get to the point where we live side by side in peace?&quot;, &quot;How did you make the first move to the militants on the other side?&quot; - the questions flooded in thick and fast, and were dealt with skilfully by Itamar, Usama and their fellow CFP founder, Ory. Whether you regard CFP as an effective tool against the warmongers or not, ultimately it fills a vacuum that may otherwise be occupied by less peaceful groups on both sides. Especially when working with children who will be the soldiers of tomorrow, and as such require as much first-hand knowledge of the situation as possible in order to be well-armed mentally when it comes to their own national service. In order to take down the organs of war, the word must continue to be spread to Israelis and Palestinians of all ages and all persuasions. Which is why CFP is so vital, in order to promote &quot;another way&quot; rather than just allow people to subscribe to the dominant notion that the only way to resolve the conflict is through violent means. And so, even though they&apos;re older and wiser than they were when they were front-line combatants, it&apos;s greatly to the CFP team&apos;s credit that they didn&apos;t become more entrenched and right wing with age - and to the benefit of the entire region as well.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-25T11:00:00Z", "title": "Combatants for peace", "sentences": ["CFP had convened a meeting in Tel Aviv&apos;s Secular Yeshiva, bringing their campaign to the attention of a group of pre-army teens who study there voluntarily, having completed high school.", "Sitting in a large circle in a classroom, with the sounds of downtown Tel Aviv threatening to drown out the proceedings, the students spent two hours enthralled by the stories of war and peace being told."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/25/combatantsforpeace"}], "docs": 383, "sentences": 523}
