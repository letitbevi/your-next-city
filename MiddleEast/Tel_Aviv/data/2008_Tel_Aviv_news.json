LEADING FROM BEHIND The Backbencher was hoping to bring readers a photo of a diminutive French president helping an ex-supermodel negotiate an awkward pyramid at Giza by applying gentle pressure to her behind, but picture copyright issues prevented it. In any case, she knows readers are far more interested in the progress of Sarko&apos;s labour reforms. Pending further news on those, here are the same players recreating a scene from The Godfather. Ensemble tout devient possible, eh? You wouldn&apos;t catch Gordon in shades, even in Egypt. It&apos;s almost enough to make the Backbencher miss Tony. Almost.

They could all have safe, clean water within 10 years, for just a tiny fraction of the cost of global military spending. Why isn&apos;t it happening? Most governments, especially rich white ones, would apparently rather buy weapons to kill other human beings than build water facilities to save the lives of black, brown and yellow poor people. According to the Stockholm international peace research institute, in 2006 total global military expenditure topped $1.2tn; with the US accounting for $528.7bn of this spending and the UK for $59.2bn. At a cost of about 5% of the world&apos;s military budgets, over a period of 10 years clean, safe water could be provided to every person on earth. But this won&apos;t happen because while the poor are deprived, the rich are depraved. Mega-rich individuals, corporations and nations rule the world. They worship the false idols of celebrity, money, profits, consumerism, speculation and conspicuous consumption. Love, compassion, mercy and human solidarity are largely alien ideals in the ruthless, cut-throat world of free markets and stockmarkets. The super-wealthy know the price of everything and the value of nothing. People are commodities, just like sacks of maize or barrels of oil. Human needs are not important. Money is everything, and since the poor don&apos;t have it, they are held in contempt. Hundreds of millions of non-white people are condemned to drink muddy, stinking water. If the have-a-lots care, they don&apos;t show it. Their unspoken message seems to be: let them drink shit. While children are dying all over the world every day from contaminated water, the rich world carries on regardless. And we, the people, are to blame. We let the rich get away with their greed. We keep electing governments who, at the drop of a hat, find billions to wage illegal, immoral wars, but who can&apos;t bring themselves to even marginally downsize their armaments budget to finance a truly just battle - the battle to give everyone on this planet what we, in Britain and the west, assume is a fundamental right: easy access to drinking water that tastes good and won&apos;t harm us. Our government would not tolerate people dying of waterborne diseases in the UK. So why should we tolerate such needless deaths in developing countries? Isn&apos;t a human being a human being, whoever they are and wherever they live on this planet? Aren&apos;t all people&apos;s lives equally precious? Apparently not, otherwise there would be concerted international action to tackle the shame of dirty water and the resultant obscene waste of human life. I recently interviewed Nick Edmans of the charity WaterAid for my online TV series, Talking With Tatchell. He confirmed that in the eighth year of the 21st century, at least 1.1 billion people have no fresh, safe water to drink. Before this day is over, 5,000 children will die from infected water, leaving up to 10,000 parents grieving - tonight, and every night. All in all, around 2.2 million people - 1.8 million of them children - are killed each year by waterborne diseases. A further 2.6 billion people have no secure, hygienic toilet facilities. They use rudimentary holes in the ground which breed disease. The human waste leaches into the soil, often contaminating the groundwater that supplies wells and despoiling rivers where people bathe, wash and fish. This morning I woke up and walked 12 feet to my kitchen tap. I drank a large refreshing glass of pure water. Alas, the easily accessible, clean, safe water that we take for granted in the west is only a distant dream for one-sixth of the world&apos;s population, especially in Asia and Africa. Hundreds of millions of poor people have to trek for many miles and hours every day to fetch often foul-smelling, diseased drinking water that can cause deadly dysentery, cholera, typhoid and intestinal worms and parasites. The lack of safe water supplies frequently impacts worst on marginal social groups, such as lower castes and ethnic minorities, who may be denied access to the best water sources and be forced to pay premium prices to private suppliers. Some tourist developments in developing countries, such as big hotels and golf courses, involve the private owners sinking their own bore holes to extract water from below ground. This often results in the depression of the water table, drying up wells and causing water crises in the surrounding villages. Water shortages and a lack of affordability in developing countries have, in some cases, been exacerbated by privatisation, which has usually benefited urban dwellers to the neglect of their rural counterparts, and has usually resulted in private monopolies and price hikes, to the detriment of low income families. With global warming and rising populations, the prospect looms of future disputes - even wars - over shortages of fresh water supplies. A foretaste of such disputes can be seen in the friction between Israel and the Palestine over Tel Aviv&apos;s diversion of water from the Jordan river to meet Israeli demand, leaving the West Bank under-supplied. It strikes me as utterly immoral that in the midst of a world of immense wealth and plenty, billions of people have so little - not even the basics of life like safe water to drink. Surely, it is time for a major global effort to redistribute wealth from rich nations to poor ones and to divert investment in weapons and wars to health-sustaining, life-saving development projects such as the universal provision of cheap, accessible, clean water? Safe water is a human right. Give them water, not war.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-03T18:00:00Z", "title": "Water not war", "sentences": ["A foretaste of such disputes can be seen in the friction between Israel and the Palestine over Tel Aviv&apos;s diversion of water from the Jordan river to meet Israeli demand, leaving the West Bank under-supplied."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/03/waternotwar"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "It is arguably an interesting reflection of the political debate about how to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that pro-Palestinian opponents of the two-state solution sometimes argue that their preferred vision of &quot;one secular democratic state in all of Israel and Palestine ... is a goal that the Israeli leaders fear more than anything&quot;. Does anybody really doubt that this &quot;one-state solution&quot; is not only &quot;Olmert&apos;s worst nightmare&quot;, but that it is a scenario that also the vast majority of Israel&apos;s Jewish citizens would view as an existential threat? Do any of the advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot; even notice that while they invoke the Palestinian right to self-determination, their &quot;solution&quot; denies Israeli Jews this very same right? Why would anybody feel it is legitimate to claim that international law confers on the Palestinians the status of &quot;a recognised people with a right to self-determination&quot; while denying that this same claim is valid for the Jews? But the most intriguing question is perhaps whether any advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot; realise how much they actually &quot;sound just like the far right in Israel&quot;. It truly is Israel&apos;s far right and the ideologically motivated settler movement, for whom &quot;eretz yisra&apos;el ha-sh&apos;lema&quot;, the &quot;undivided land of Israel&quot; is the sacred priority to which all else must be subordinated that provide both a paradoxical mirror image and an unexpected ally for the advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot;. To begin with, both groups espouse an astonishingly similar view of Palestinian history and identity. The settlers&apos; standard argumentation, which denies that there is any historical validity to Palestinian claims of a distinct identity and insinuates that the Palestinians have never been really interested in establishing a state alongside Israel, but only instead of Israel, is easily confirmed by some of the statements in a recent Guardian article by Ahmad Samih Khalidi: &quot;statehood as such is a relatively recent addition to Palestinian aspirations. The main Palestinian impetus after ... 1948 was that of &apos;return&apos;; it was more about reversing the loss of Arab land and patrimony, than the fulfillment of classical post-colonial self-determination, via statehood ... &quot;It was only after ... 1967 that a new Palestinian national identity began to take shape. At its core was the notion of the armed struggle as a galvanizing force. Armed struggle ... restored Palestinian dignity ... Statehood and state building had no real place in this scheme. Indeed, the first tentative proposals to establish a state ... were rejected as defeatist and a betrayal of the national cause.&quot; Another obvious similarity between the pro-Palestinian advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot; and their supposedly most bitter enemies among Israel&apos;s far right settlers is the notion of the indivisibility of the territory of historic Palestine and the resulting disdain for those who would rather have a compromise peace now than continue the conflict in order to fight on for the &quot;noble&quot; cause of getting it all. The Israeli right is full of contempt for the proponents of &quot;the pacifist and surrendering ideology of appeasement ... the grotesque imitators of Chamberlain and Deladier who promise &apos;peace and a new Middle East&apos;,&quot; while the advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot; are equally contemptuous of &quot;the methods of Abbas and Fayyad - the way of diplomatic privileges, backroom compromises and appeasement of Washington and Tel Aviv&quot;. To be sure, the two groups profess to have very different motivations, but there is again a surprising similarity in the tactics they hope to employ in pursuit of their final victory: the &quot;one-state&quot; advocates talk a lot about democracy, but it is a democracy that depends on demography - a state with a Jewish majority can apparently never be democratic and thus deserves to be denounced as resting on &quot;inherently discriminatory foundations&quot; enshrining &quot;ethno-religious supremacy&quot;; but once this Jewish majority will have been turned into a minority by demography, democracy will have triumphed. And while the settlers couldn&apos;t care less about democracy, they too know to appreciate what demography can do to further their aims. Ultimately, all those who dream of &quot;one state&quot; claim rights for themselves that they are not willing to grant others: both the Israeli settlers and the pro-Palestinian activists envision &quot;one state&quot; that would come at the expense of the other group&apos;s right to self-determination. And in both visions, the group that would loose its right to self-determination is meant to be a minority that will have to live by the rules set by the majority. In the war of words, eloquent academics may fare much better than gun-toting settlers, but while the settlers don&apos;t hide their willingness to fight for their goals, the one-state campaigners are content to quietly urge Palestinians not to give up until their demands for one state are met unconditionally. The argument that the dire situation in which many Palestinians find themselves &quot;deprived of their most fundamental needs, like food, shelter and basic services&quot; makes it imperative to work for a quick end to the occupation is rejected as &quot;patronising&quot;. For the advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot;, the notion of compromise for the sake of ending the occupation before the terms dictated by them are achieved only reveals the arrogant assumption &quot;that Palestinians, unlike humans everywhere, are willing to forfeit their long-term rights to freedom, equality and self-determination in return for some transient alleviation of their most immediate suffering.&quot; And this is perhaps the strangest twist: the settlers thus are the unwitting allies of the proponents of the &quot;one-state solution&quot;, who credit the occupation with having already created the &quot;one-state reality&quot;: &quot;There already is &apos;one state&apos; and the remaining question, and real debate, is over its character.&quot; But make no mistake: the settlers and Israel&apos;s far right don&apos;t mind at all if the Palestinians refuse compromises by insisting that the occupation will end only with a &quot;one-state solution&quot;. While pro-Palestinian campaigners for &quot;one state&quot; hope that the world will blame Israel for failing to end the occupation and delivering the two-state solution that is overwhelmingly supported by the international community, the Israeli far right hopes the world will eventually conclude that the Palestinians have indeed never given up their often candidly expressed opposition to the partition of Palestine and thus have never really wanted a two-state solution. And in this case, just as the &quot;one-state&quot; campaigners now claim that their vision is already reality, the far right will argue that the only realistic two-state solution was implemented long ago with the creation of the Kingdom of Jordan. Maximalists on both sides ultimately hope that their dreams will come true as the other side&apos;s worst nightmare, and while everybody else may be part of the sane majority, there is no doubt that this majority has been all too silent for all too long. But given Mideast realities, one can perhaps not blame the sane if they fear the nightmares too much to dream of a peace that would prove the maximalists wrong.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-04T14:00:00Z", "title": "A meeting of minds", "sentences": ["The Israeli right is full of contempt for the proponents of &quot;the pacifist and surrendering ideology of appeasement ... the grotesque imitators of Chamberlain and Deladier who promise &apos;peace and a new Middle East&apos;,&quot; while the advocates of the &quot;one-state solution&quot; are equally contemptuous of &quot;the methods of Abbas and Fayyad - the way of diplomatic privileges, backroom compromises and appeasement of Washington and Tel Aviv&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/04/ameetingofminds"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "US news", "George Bush", "Al-Qaida", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Israeli officials in Jerusalem are to deploy more than 10,000 police officers in a vast security operation ahead of the arrival this week of George Bush, the first US president to visit in a decade. Graffiti are being cleaned off walls, road markings are being repainted and hundreds of American flags are being put up across the city. The floodlights which illuminate the stone ramparts of the Old City will stay on for an extra two hours every night, until 2am, to give the president the chance to catch the view. Hundreds of hotel rooms across Jerusalem have been booked for Bush&apos;s group, as well as for the media and even Israeli officials, who fear they might not be able to make it home in the evenings. Bush, who arrives on Wednesday for his first visit as president, will stay at the King David hotel. Eight truckloads of equipment have already arrived in advance of his two-night stay. All the hotel&apos;s rooms will be taken by his entourage - tourists have had their bookings cancelled. The security precautions, dubbed Operation Clear Skies by the Israeli security services, are immense. Roads around the hotel will be blocked, despite the huge traffic jams that will entail. A force of 10,500 police and security staff will be deployed and Bush will be flown in to the hotel by helicopter from the airport near Tel Aviv. &quot;There will be so much security nobody will be able to get anywhere near the president,&quot; said Micky Rosenfield, Israel&apos;s police spokesman. Yesterday an American militant linked to al-Qaida, Adam Gadahn, released an Arabic language internet video calling for attacks on Bush during his Middle East visit. In Jerusalem some protests are expected from rightwing groups, particularly from a vocal organisation that lobbies for the release of Jonathan Pollard, who was jailed in the US in 1986 for spying for Israel. Pollard&apos;s supporters have taken out adverts on Jerusalem buses in Hebrew and English that read &quot;Bush, free your captive&quot;. The president is pictured alongside Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader, and Hassan Nasrullah, the Hizbullah leader. Beneath them are pictures of Pollard alongside three Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas and Hizbullah last year. Separately yesterday, the crisis afflicting Gaza worsened when Palestinian officials said they would now have to cut off electricity for eight hours every day, because Israel has sharply cut fuel supplies. Israel says the cut in supplies is to stop militants firing rockets into its territory. Kanan Obeid, chairman of the Gazan energy authority, said the strip, home to 1.5 million Palestinians, had only 35% of the power it needed because of fuel shortages. The power plant is to shut down one of its two gas turbines, reducing output further. Water and sewerage systems are now particularly vulnerable. Three Palestinians, civilians according to local officials, were killed in Israeli raids in Gaza yesterday.

Over a hundred vocal Peace Now protesters, dozens of banners and placards unfurled in the January wind and a sizeable press pack on hand to record the proceedings. The organisers whipped the crowd into life, shouting into loudhailers to get the chanting going, as others clapped and cheered the speeches of various leftwing luminaries. However, the one missing element was also the most crucial in terms of taking on the settlers and showing them that not all Israelis are willing to turn a blind eye to their misdeeds. Namely, access to the settlement itself, which the police had decided was well out of bounds for the busloads of demonstrators who had flocked in from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There were almost as many policemen and soldiers as there were protesters, so seriously did the authorities take their duty of preventing a head-to-head meeting between the two camps. Instead, they restricted the marchers to a desolate, windswept patch of ground a full kilometre away from the edge of the settlement, all but negating the impact of the protest on the very people at which it was aimed. In the event, they needn&apos;t have worried about a clash, since that was never on the agenda of those running the show. For my part, I&apos;d seen it all before: the left wing making a lot of noise, whistling and stamping their feet in condemnation of the settlers&apos; expansionism while the settlement juggernaut continued rolling on unchecked, deeper and deeper into the West Bank. What difference was a protest in the middle of nowhere going to make, if not a single settler was there to feel the force of their opponents&apos; rage? It was like the proverbial tree falling in a forest again; if no one was there to hear, then whether or not there was a noise was of little consequence. However, according to the organisers of the protest, this one was staged entirely for the benefit of the media, and neither party was let down on that front. Timed to coincide with President Bush&apos;s first visit to the country, the leaders of Peace Now were well aware that all eyes are focused on Israel this week, and realised the potential for exposure that such an event would offer them. The more incendiary the placards, the more the press lapped it up - filming and photographing the gathering for both local and international media. The police looked on benevolently, having realised that this was to be no more than a photo opportunity for the left, and not in the slightest bit likely to turn tense or violent. However, among all the stage-managed chanting and ever-so-civilised protesting, there were murmurs of discontent among the crowd, many of whom wondered whether their actions would have any real effect on curtailing the ongoing illegal construction. &quot;I&apos;m not very comfortable with this,&quot; one man told me as we looked up in the direction of the Migron outpost. &quot;After all, does our presence even register with the settlers over the hill?&quot; &quot;Where&apos;s the direct action?&quot; asked another. &quot;When they [the right wing] decide to take a stand, they throw up a new hilltop settlement overnight, and the army just look on. We need to fight fire with fire, rather than just moan about it a few weeks later.&quot; I agreed wholeheartedly. I&apos;d said as much after my tour of the West Bank last summer. However, according to one of Meretz&apos;s leaders, non-confrontational protest is still the watchword of the Israeli left, &quot;since we don&apos;t want to come across like a bunch of hooligans.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s the right decision,&quot; he told me, &quot;but it&apos;s the strategy that we&apos;ve chosen.&quot; I suggested that they could disrupt illegal settlement construction without violent means, such as staging sit-ins on the site of planned outposts. If the army chose to evict them rather than the settlers, it would prove in a most explicit fashion that the authorities do tacitly support the settlers&apos; activities. And, if the press were on hand to record such a scenario, it would at least have the effect of seriously embarrassing the government when confronted with the evidence. &quot;It&apos;s not a bad idea,&quot; he replied, as though considering it for the first time. &quot;Why don&apos;t you go and suggest it to Noa [one of the Peace Now organisers]?&quot; I was amazed they hadn&apos;t given this idea some thought before, but on reflection realised that this state of inertia among the left is hardly news to me or anyone else. Instead of going for the jugular - using the same hands-on tactics that have made the settler activists so successful - they are instead happy to sit back and take the easy option in order to salve their consciences. They have the press in their pockets - a few emails and text messages and they can mobilise as many reporters and camera crews as they desire, guaranteeing that they&apos;ll get good coverage in the next day&apos;s news. Which is all well and good, and clearly serves them well in the publicity stakes, but has a negligible effect in terms of cutting the head off the settlement snake. While the intelligentsia are shaking their heads in sympathy with the protesters as they read Haaretz or watch BBC World, the settlers are busily constructing more and more &quot;facts on the ground&quot;, which prove impossibly hard to deracinate once they&apos;ve taken root. Nothing changes for the better, and the cycle continues for another week, another month, another year. Bush&apos;s inaugural visit to Israel is the perfect time to shine the spotlight on the settlements and the left&apos;s opposition to their continued expansion. However, shying away from real action and just repeating the same tired old slogans seems an unworthy way to mark the occasion. Impotent chanting from the sidelines isn&apos;t what&apos;s needed now - it&apos;s got much too late for that. Fighting fire with fire may make for some uncomfortable alternative demonstrations but since it&apos;s the only thing that will make the authorities really sit up and take notice, perhaps it&apos;s the only potent weapon left in the peace camp&apos;s arsenal.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-09T08:30:00Z", "title": "A time for action", "sentences": ["Namely, access to the settlement itself, which the police had decided was well out of bounds for the busloads of demonstrators who had flocked in from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/09/atimeforaction"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Tottenham Hotspur"], "article": "Pascal Chimbonda is ready to leave Tottenham in fury at the club&apos;s moves to sign replacement right-backs in the transfer window. The Guadeloupe-born French international has seen Damien Comolli, Spurs&apos; sporting director, welcome Chris Gunter from Cardiff City and offer in excess of \u00a38m for Alan Hutton of Rangers.  Gunter, 18, is primarily a prospect for the future and Hutton has turned down the move - after Rangers accepted Spurs&apos; bid - but Chimbonda feels badly let down. The 28-year-old, capped once by France and an unused member of their squad at the last World Cup, feels he has done what has been asked of him this season, a trying one for the Tottenham defence, even filling in at centre-back under Juande Ramos when selection crises have arisen.  Chimbonda endured a torrid 45 minutes alongside Michael Dawson in the Uefa Cup tie against Aalborg before the new manger rejigged his tactics at 2-0 down. Given his dislike for that position - he also occupied it at Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Uefa Cup and Arsenal in the Premier League - Chimbonda feels it is unfair to mark him down on his performances there.  Yet Ramos considers that Chimbonda has fallen short generally of the required standards and he is content to replace him. The player has seen the writing on the wall and the revelation of his unhappiness and potential availability is sure to prompt interest in his signature. He would consider offers from any of the Premier League&apos;s top eight clubs.  Chimbonda left Bastia in France for Wigan in 2005 for a fee of \u00a3500,000 and he capped an impressive debut Premier League campaign by being voted on to the PFA&apos;s team of the season. He then forced through an acrimonious \u00a35.25m transfer to Tottenham and stepped up again, his swashbuckling style winning fans over.  Yet his relationship with the club has soured. He was courted by Chelsea last summer and the critics have claimed that their interest turned his head. But Ramos, who replaced Martin Jol at the end of October, has set him on a different course. These are turbulent times behind the scenes at Tottenham as the Spaniard, having assessed the squad he inherited, begins to consider changes. Jermain Defoe said on Monday that Ramos was willing to let him go, although the striker has resolved to stay and fight for his place, and Darren Bent, too, is concerned at his lack of regular first-team football.  The club fear that Dimitar Berbatov will leave them in the summer - the striker has his heart set on a move to Manchester United - and are making contingency plans, among them a move for Fred, Lyon&apos;s \u00a311m-rated Brazil international.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-10T02:16:28Z", "title": "Chimbonda desperate to quit Tottenham", "sentences": ["Given his dislike for that position - he also occupied it at Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Uefa Cup and Arsenal in the Premier League - Chimbonda feels it is unfair to mark him down on his performances there."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jan/10/newsstory.tottenhamhotspur"}, {"tags": ["US news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "It is a well-deserved irony for George Bush that his first presidential visit to Israel coincided this week with the storm of excitement produced by the unexpected outcome of the two New Hampshire primaries. Nothing could better highlight the irrelevance of the final year of the Bush presidency. The moment at which an incumbent becomes a lame duck fluctuates in every US administration, depending on circumstances. The day on which the first votes are cast is traditionally the symbolic date, even though the race has been under way in the media for months. This year&apos;s riveting contests in New Hampshire certainly proved that true, overshadowing whatever interest there was in Bush&apos;s plans for influencing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even before the president left Washington, expectations for his visit were low. His much-trumpeted meeting of Middle Eastern leaders in Annapolis in November produced a predictably tinny follow-up. Little happened in the subsequent six weeks, and it was only courtesy to Bush that impelled Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas to meet again in advance of the president&apos;s touchdown in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and produce the blandest pretence of progress. According to Olmert&apos;s spokesman, they agreed to &quot;authorise their negotiating teams to conduct direct and ongoing negotiations on all the core issues&quot;. Isn&apos;t this tautological statement merely a repeat of what they had already launched in Annapolis? Bush&apos;s engagement in the world&apos;s most intractable dispute is late, piecemeal and phoney. Above all, it is one-sided. As Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister, remarked this week: &quot;Palestinians agree that in the history of the United States, Bush is more biased toward Israel than any other American president.&quot; In any conflict, responsibility for making the largest concessions always rests on the stronger party, especially when most of the wrong is on its side. But, despite his rhetoric yesterday, Bush has not used Washington&apos;s enormous leverage over Israel to end the occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He has not even applied pressure for an end to the expansion of Israeli settlements or the dismantling of the spider&apos;s web of roadblocks that make normal life for Palestinians impossible. A US plan for benchmarks by which to judge Israeli progress was quickly abandoned last spring at the first whiff of concern by Olmert&apos;s government. Occasional state department pronouncements disapproving of settlement expansion are not followed by measures to reflect US anger when - as happened in Jerusalem again on Wednesday - Olmert makes it clear he will continue the illegal construction of Israeli homes. Any talk of dealing with &quot;core issues&quot; is meaningless without measures to reduce the daily hardships of Palestinians and end the kidnapping of hundreds of Palestinian leaders. About 40 Palestinian MPs who were seized after Hamas&apos;s election victory two years ago remain in Israeli prisons, uncharged and seemingly forgotten by Bush and other western governments. US and European policies towards Hamas remain hopelessly unjust and counterproductive. In the first phase of the so-called roadmap that Bush boasts of having revived, Palestinians are supposed to build the institutions of a responsible state. Yet Israel and the US continue to do all they can to undermine this laudable goal by blatantly taking sides in the rivalry between Fatah and Hamas. Bush&apos;s comment yesterday in Ramallah about the situation in Gaza was one of history&apos;s most extraordinary examples of tunnel vision. &quot;Hamas has delivered nothing but misery for Palestinians,&quot; he declared. Had he said, &quot;My reaction and that of my Israeli and European Union colleagues to the mandate given Hamas by Palestinian voters has delivered nothing but misery for Palestinians&quot;, he would have been closer to the truth. The human catastrophe deliberately inflicted on Gaza by western policies over the past two years is one of the great crimes of this century so far. It is especially unjustified since Hamas had been observing a truce in its attacks on Israelis for several months prior to winning the &quot;free, fair and open elections&quot; that the roadmap asked for. Hamas was, and continues to be, punished not for its occasional use of violence but simply for being popular. And, as often happens with sanctions, it is not the leaders who suffer, but the whole civilian population of the territory - deprived of medicine, adequate food, public services and jobs. Rather than pursuing the chimera of a final settlement that would mean nothing without Hamas&apos;s endorsement, western policy should focus on more manageable humanitarian and political goals: lifting the boycott of Hamas, promoting Palestinian unity, and forcing Israel to end its brutal siege of Gaza. Bush is not the first US president to take an interest in the Middle East in the last year of an eight-year period of office. Bill Clinton also applied his mind to it in the dying months of his second term. Yet his performance was very different: Clinton had endorsed the Oslo process early in his first term, and showed considerable energy in pushing it forward and supporting the new Palestinian Authority. Later, in spite of being a lame duck by the year 2000, he tried hard to get agreement between Arafat and Barak at Camp David, on a final settlement that was not loaded overwhelmingly in Israel&apos;s favour. It was a model of how American presidents can act more firmly when released from the pressures of seeking election. It only needs an effort of will for a lame duck to become the bald eagle of enlightened US power. In contrast, Bush&apos;s current visit to the region is nothing more than a display of partisan cynicism, coupled with the hope that if some sort of interim deal is signed this year between Olmert and Abbas, it would erase Washington&apos;s failures in Iraq. Where does that leave Palestinians as the gathering wave of US primaries prepares to reveal the last two candidates for the Bush succession? Will they have to wait as long as 2016 before President Clinton or President Obama is free enough to confront Israeli intransigence and to insist on concessions? Neither candidate has yet given any sign of breaking away from traditional pro-Israeli views of the problem, so once again Palestinians may have to wait for the eighth-year miracle. Windows of opportunity open so rarely, yet the need for early action has never been more urgent.  j.steele@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-01-11T15:15:40Z", "title": "Jonathan Steele: Welcome, Mr President, to the misery you've created", "sentences": ["Little happened in the subsequent six weeks, and it was only courtesy to Bush that impelled Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas to meet again in advance of the president&apos;s touchdown in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and produce the blandest pretence of progress."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/11/usa.world"}, {"tags": ["World news", "US news", "Iran", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "US politics"], "article": "President George Bush yesterday began canvassing Arab support for containing Iran as his Middle East tour moved to the Gulf amid concerns about escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran.

It&apos;s as if we defined all books as comics and, in this baggage of nomenclature, we lose sight of capability. The future of video games is to be a true medium, conveying all human life, that will educate, entertain and inform but above all engage. It is this power of engagement that means games will, in my opinion, eclipse TV and films, in the same way that they have eclipsed books and theatre. The test of a medium is the ability to touch all our lives. Games are not there yet, but you only have to see my octogenarian father-in-law rejoice at getting his brain age down to 34 on his Nintendo DS to realise that games are spreading to everyone. As in other media, games will serve many different audiences, providing high art as well as entertainment, violence and pornography. Rupert Murdoch has said that those over 35 years old are digital immigrants while those of us under 35 are digital natives. The problem is the rules and regulators that govern the growth of the digital world, including gaming, are being created by the first group, the digital immigrants. This means we are in a period of digital colonialism where the culture of one era tries to dictate the culture of another. Old attitudes and approaches born from linear media - books, broadcast TV and films - hold games back. If you are a parent rationing video games to your children, you are the same as a late 19thcentury parent saying &quot;get your nose out of that book and do something useful&quot;. You are, in fact, depriving them of the literacy of the 21st century.  Yossi Matias, director, Tel Aviv R&amp;D Engineering Centre, Google Two of the most exciting things happening on the web right now are the advent of the mobile internet and the shift toward &quot;cloud computing&quot;. Taken together, they represent fundamental shifts in the way people interact with the internet, with their own information and with one another and we will begin to see these shifts in 2008. Mobiles present some challenges, small screens and slower data connections, but they also offer amazing opportunities. There are three billion mobiles in use and the GSM Association predicts 90% of the world&apos;s population will live within range of a mobile network by 2010. Moreover, people typically keep their mobiles with them all the time, so mobiles have an edge in providing everything from basic information to location-based services. Cloud computing is sometimes called &quot;software as a service&quot; or web-native software, the key feature being that both the software and the information accessed through the software live on centrallylocated servers rather than on a single computer. This means information can be accessed from any web-enabled device and, if your laptop or phone dies or is stolen, you can still access the information you need. Cloud computing is a growing trend and it will increase the use of web-enabled gadgets, thereby turning Google and others into distribution platforms.  Neil Gaydon, chief executive officer, Pace Micro Technology How we watch and pay for TV is changing and the adoption of personal video recording (PVR), high definition (HD) TV and broadband TV are all significant trends. With some 200m video cassette recorders still in use in Europe, the personal video recording revolution has a long way to go. However, once people get used to recording and viewing what they want, when they want and pausing live TV, they won&apos;t go back. Eventually consumers will want these features throughout their homes and that will lead to the networked home. Whereas PVR has largely grown through word of mouth, high definition TV requires no explanation and is a &quot;wow&quot; visual experience. The adoption of more efficient video compression transmission technologies - known as MPEG4 and DVB-T2 - will enable HD on Freeview during 2009, a major step towards more HDTV in the UK. Meanwhile, major pay- TV companies such as Sky are showing more HD programming, which will lead to Europe catching up with the US. We will see steps in 2008 toward broadcast and broadband content delivered via a single, converged device and it won&apos;t be a PC.

But it&apos;s not Ringo drumming on the roof of Liverpool&apos;s St George&apos;s Hall - it&apos;s Norwegian stuntman Eskil Ronningsbakken cycling along a wire suspended over the tip of the icy fjord that bites into Stavanger harbour. Ronningsbakken appears to lose his balance. The crowd gasp then cheer as he executes a confident handstand. It&apos;s a spectacular moment that seems to sum up Stavanger&apos;s bid to become European Capital of Culture for 2008: a feat of almost preposterous audacity. The fact that Norway&apos;s fourth largest city was also celebrating over the weekend was, unsurprisingly, eclipsed in this country by coverage of Liverpool. But there is some reluctance on Liverpool&apos;s part to acknowledge that it is sharing its big year. Although the Stavanger 2008 website features a page wishing good luck to Merseyside, the Liverpool Culture Company&apos;s 200-page brochure does not make a single reference to its Scandinavian cousin. Stavanger&apos;s programme can hardly be expected to compete with Liverpool&apos;s in terms of scale. Its budget is only \u00a328.5m, just over a quarter of Liverpool&apos;s, and its population of 117,000 hardly competes with England&apos;s largest cities. Yet Stavanger has a history of punching above its weight: its imposing 12th-century cathedral was built when there were barely enough people to fill it, and offshore oil and gas in the 1960s transformed a small fishing community into a boom town. Stavanger has always been a model of Norwegian self-sufficiency. Before oil, there were sardines; the often surreal graphic designs on the 19th-century sardine tin labels are arguably the city&apos;s most influential contribution to visual culture. Wages are high, unemployment practically nonexistent, and the chances of Stavanger&apos;s opening celebrations coinciding, as Liverpool&apos;s did, with teenage gang shootings in the suburbs are remote. According to the Global Peace Index, Norway is the safest country in the world. &quot;Stavanger has what many would consider to be the perfectly functioning society,&quot; says Mary Miller, the Scottish director of Stavanger&apos;s 2008 celebrations. &quot;Yet that might equally be perceived as its problem. There&apos;s a danger that in a society where everyone is middle class, there will also be a certain insularity and a reticence to submit to new ideas.&quot; The city has a highly regarded symphony orchestra and a productive regional theatre, but unlike Oslo, which hosts the annual Ibsen festival, and Bergen, the birthplace of Grieg, Stavanger has no major figure to celebrate. Instead, the 2008 programme sets out to challenge parochialism by emphasising international influence, although there are no major celebrities or big names adding glamour to the bill. &quot;If you brought in the Berlin Philharmonic,&quot; says Miller, &quot;people would say, &apos;But we have a perfectly good orchestra here.&apos;&quot; Instead, Miller has devised a themed programme known as Open Port, based on a series of residencies from four companies that are nothing if not diverse: Tel Aviv&apos;s Inbal Pinto dance company, the Oskaras Korsunovas theatre company from Lithuania, the Belgian experimental opera group Transparant, and the Handspring Puppet workshop of South Africa. Each will create a new piece by working with local residents and artists. Miller&apos;s decision to import cultural practitioners has not gone unchallenged. In 2005, graffiti around the city demanded &quot;Ka ta ittepa?&quot; (What happens afterwards?), the slogan of a pressure group of local artists who felt excluded. &quot;The fact is,&quot; argues Miller, &quot;there simply are not sufficient Norwegian artists to create the work required for a project of this scale or ambition on their own. We have to remember that we are supposed to be delivering a European capital of culture, not a Norwegian one.&quot; Though the cultural landscape of Stavanger remains relatively small, the physical landscape is astounding, and many of the year&apos;s events belong to a unique genre that straddles dance, theatre - and extreme sport. Abseil specialists Bandaloop will hurl themselves off a rock face; 100 residents will take part in a light-and-snow spectacular, accessible only by ski lift; and Rogaland Theatre will colonise an entire island to present a site-specific work, Adventures in Landscape. Meanwhile, international artists have been challenged to turn the region&apos;s cluster of lighthouses into a linked light installation laced along the coast. Naturally, this being Norway, there are trolls. In bygone years, the citizens of Stavanger rang the church bells to keep the elfin folk away, but at the opening celebrations on January 12 they were out in force: stalking around the cobbled streets of the old town centre before converging on Breiavatnet, a lake at the heart of the city, which became the scene of a magical pageant featuring burning boats floating across the water. An estimated 60,000 people turned out for the festivities, which continued all night with concerts in churches and bars, concluding with a grand party at Tou Scene, a 19th-century former brewery that&apos;s the hub of Stavanger&apos;s alternative scene. Tou Scene is the home of the NuMusic Festival, a summer event that promotes art exhibitions alongside dance nights and visits from electronic music pioneers; two years ago the late Karlheinz Stockhausen was the guest of honour. A mini-festival last weekend included a set by Knut Jonas, alternately known as King Knut, a DJ and producer born in Stavanger and now living in London. Stavanger is proud of its status as the largest wooden city in Europe, though its 18th- and 19th-century clapboard houses now share the city with the concrete blocks of oil company headquarters. By the end of 2008, Norwegian Wood, the inevitable name for the competition for new timber constructions, aims to have completed a dozen building projects in the region, including 400 living spaces, two bridges, a kindergarten and a mountain lodge. The \u20ac20m (\u00a315m) invested in Norwegian Wood will be one visible legacy of the Capital of Culture long after the fireworks have faded. Though relatively modest, the project stands in striking comparison to Liverpool&apos;s failed plan to build a &quot;fourth grace&quot; on the waterfront. Stavanger&apos;s targets may be smaller than Liverpool&apos;s, but by expecting less it could end up achieving rather more, or seeming to. &quot;We are so much the little cousin of Liverpool that there are many areas where we cannot even hope to compete,&quot; says Grete Kvinnesland of the Norwegian Wood project. &quot;But there is one aspect of culture in which we cannot be beaten. What is the one thing that everyone who comes to Stavanger remembers? Little wooden houses.&quot; \u00b7 Details: www.stavanger2008.no", "publicationDate": "2008-01-16T10:08:05Z", "title": "Alfred Hickling reports from Stavanger - Europe's other Capital of Culture in 2008", "sentences": ["&quot;If you brought in the Berlin Philharmonic,&quot; says Miller, &quot;people would say, &apos;But we have a perfectly good orchestra here.&apos;&quot; Instead, Miller has devised a themed programme known as Open Port, based on a series of residencies from four companies that are nothing if not diverse: Tel Aviv&apos;s Inbal Pinto dance company, the Oskaras Korsunovas theatre company from Lithuania, the Belgian experimental opera group Transparant, and the Handspring Puppet workshop of South Africa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jan/16/europeancapitalofculture2008.theatre"}, {"tags": ["Dance", "Culture", "Theatre", "Stage"], "article": "The earliest credit for the actor and dancer Bob Smith, who has died aged 61 of lung cancer, was for the title role in Stravinsky&apos;s The Soldier&apos;s Tale at the Bluecoat Arts Centre in his native Liverpool. He was then aged 17. He had accompanied his girlfriend to a rehearsal for the production that I was directing. She had already been cast as the Princess; the part of the Devil had also been cast; and by the end of the rehearsal, Bob had become the Soldier. It was an experience that was to prove life-changing. He abandoned his plans to go from the city&apos;s Collegiate school to study modern languages at Manchester University (though not his lifelong enthusiasm for languages) and started training at the Shelagh Elliott-Clarke School of Dance and Drama in Liverpool, before heading off for London and training at the Ballet Rambert School. Within two years Bob was a member of the Ballet Rambert company, later the Rambert Dance Company. And for the next four decades he was at the heart of the changes that swept through British dance as the achievements, and the modern technique, of the American dance pioneer Martha Graham crossed the Atlantic. What made Bob so sought after by choreographers, and so popular with dancers in the late 1960s and the 1970s, was his all-embracing approach to his art. At a time when the British dance world seemed in danger of dividing into two opposing camps - contemporary dance and classical ballet - Bob was equally at home in both. In the ferment of that time he was literally here, there, and everywhere. He danced with Ballet Rambert - then venturing into an exhilarating mix of dance styles - and was outstanding in works by Glen Tetley (Pierrot Lunaire, Ziggurat, Embrace Tiger and Return to Mountain), and transcendent in Christopher Bruce&apos;s Black Angels. He appeared with London Contemporary Dance Theatre, most notably in Robert Cohan&apos;s Hunter of Angels and Shanta Quintet (in memorable duets with Namron in both productions), and in William Louther&apos;s Divertissements in the Playground of the Zodiac. He ventured to Tel Aviv to dance for a season with the Batsheva Dance Company under the direction and inspiration of a former Martha Graham performer, Jane Dudley. He toured village halls with the educational ensemble Ballet for All (a collaboration between London Contemporary Dance Theatre and the Royal Ballet). He performed in Britain, France, Egypt and the US with Galina Samsova, Andr\u00e9 Prokovsky and their New London Ballet company. Dancers tend to retire from performing in their mid-30s, and Bob would have had a distinguished career to look back on had he chosen to do so. But he saw no need to stop doing something that he enjoyed (a philosophical approach he extended to all areas of his life), and for which he continued to be in strong demand. Through the 1980s and beyond he appeared in operas at the Coliseum and Covent Garden in London, and toured nationally and internationally with the wonderful and wild (sometimes wonderful and weird) Lindsay Kemp Company. In the late 1990s, Bob&apos;s career was born again when he was cast in works by choreographer Darshan Singh Bhuller. In Recall, Bob portrayed Beckettian loneliness and decrepitude, and then his response to a vision of himself and his wife as a young couple, brought to life by youthful dancers in a tender, lyrical duet. &quot;His distress when the hallucination evaporates is truly moving,&quot; reported the Independent. In Planted Seeds, Bhuller&apos;s dance drama of a real-life tragedy in Sarajevo between a Serbian Romeo and a Muslim Juliet, Bob was cast in the pivotal role of murderer and rapist. The most good-humoured of companions offstage became the most luminous of monsters on stage. The Sunday Telegraph noted: &quot;It was particularly good to see Bob Smith on stage again. The years have not dimmed his dramatic power. He is nothing short of mesmerising as the older character who dominates the people around him, and shows all the malevolence, the bitterness, the hatred, as well as the fellow feeling for his own group that are part of Bosnia&apos;s tragedy.&quot; The work entered the repertoire of Phoenix Dance Theatre, with Bob reprising his role at The Place in London in 2003, and on tour in America in 2006. The New York Times saluted Bob, then aged 60, as &quot;a mainstay of modern British dance&quot;. Lucy Burge, a fellow dancer at Rambert, remembers him as &quot;the one you always watched whenever he was on stage&quot;. He is survived by his former partner, the arts administrator and dance teacher, Karen Burgin, their daughter Cleia Barton, and granddaughter Phoebe Barton; and by his partner, the theatre director Andrea Brooks. \u00b7 Robert Sinclair Smith, actor and dancer, born March 1 1946; died January 2 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-01-17T09:42:40Z", "title": "Obituary: Bob Smith", "sentences": ["He ventured to Tel Aviv to dance for a season with the Batsheva Dance Company under the direction and inspiration of a former Martha Graham performer, Jane Dudley."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/17/dance.culture"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Imagine a London where a sword of Damocles hangs over every street and every building. A London where the day is punctuated by missiles raining down indiscriminately on schools, homes, parks and gardens. A London where the difference between crossing the road or not could be the difference between having your face ripped to shreds by shrapnel from incoming rockets falling from the sky. For the last seven years, and especially in the wake of the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip, that has been the fate of Sderot, the beleaguered town on the edge of the Gazan-Israeli border. As the cauldron that is Gaza bubbles over with rage, Sderot finds itself in the firing line time and again, resulting in a city under siege and its people feeling utterly abandoned by their government and army. When I last visited Sderot, I was struck by the near-deserted streets, the empty malls and cafes, and the air of impending doom that hung over the city like a cloud. Today was no different, except that this time the sense of despondency and dejection in the residents I met was far more acute than a couple of months ago. The first person I spoke to, a Mizrachi man bedecked in jewellery scowling behind the counter of an empty shop, grimaced even further when I asked about the effect of this week&apos;s events. &quot;Look over there&quot;, he muttered sullenly, pointing at a mother hurrying her two children along the high street. &quot;See their suitcases? That&apos;s what it&apos;s come to now - they&apos;re all getting the hell out, and who can blame them?&quot; In the wake of the escalation of IDF operations in Gaza, and the increased salvo of Kassams fired at Sderot in response, the perennial white knight Arkadi Gaydamak has stepped in to pay for the evacuation of the local children. As he has done many times before - whether for altruistic reasons or for more self-serving ends - the Russian billionaire has filled the void left by the government&apos;s inaction, and funded respite care for the embattled city&apos;s residents. However, according to Ruth, the manageress of a local cafe, his actions only highlight the utter disregard with which the government treats the citizens of Sderot. &quot;What&apos;s going on is a war, isn&apos;t it?&quot;, she asked plaintively. &quot;Therefore they should evacuate us all until it&apos;s over&quot;. Only the day before, her sister made headline news after being hit in the head with shrapnel from a rocket, leaving her hospitalised in Beer Sheva and her family praying she&apos;ll overcome her injuries. &quot;And just now [when a Kassam landed without the warning siren being sounded], my daughter called me to say it had fallen right in front of her&quot;, she continued. Her other daughter was bussed out to a hostel in Jerusalem in the middle of the night, leaving Ruth seething at the chain of events that have wreaked so much upheaval and pain on her family. &quot;If this was happening in Tel Aviv, it would be dealt with in an instant&quot;, she declared forcefully, accusing the government of ignoring Sderot&apos;s residents simply because they were working class and poor. &quot;Even a third world country wouldn&apos;t stand by and take this kind of attack on its people&quot;, she said. &quot;We need to go back into Gaza and deal with the terrorists by force. There&apos;s no other way - there&apos;s no one on either side strong enough to bring peace through talking, so we have to let the army deal with the problem.&quot; Maor, a local man in his 20s eating breakfast in the cafe, agreed with Ruth&apos;s prescription for ending the rocket fire. &quot;We have to kill all the militants [who are launching the Kassams]&quot;, he said. &quot;It&apos;s the only way to bring quiet back to the town&quot;. He maintained: &quot;they had the chance to stop the rockets after we pulled out of Gaza, but they chose to carry on. I know they&apos;re suffering in Gaza too, but that doesn&apos;t excuse helping the terrorists attack us - they bring it on themselves.&quot; He said that around three thousand of Sderot&apos;s residents had left since the rocket attacks began, and that he too would go, given half a chance. &quot;If the government paid us to leave like they did in Gush Katif [during the disengagement], I&apos;d be out of here&quot;, he said. He, like many others in the city, doesn&apos;t want to live on the front line - they are in the line of fire more by accident than out of some kind of ideological desire to live on the final frontier of the country. These are not the zealous settlers of Hebron who intentionally plant themselves alongside the Palestinians in a drive to strengthen &quot;Greater Israel&quot;. Instead, by a cruel twist of fate, these are average Israelis trying to live normal lives in an atmosphere that is anything but. The war has been brought to their doorsteps, and while the politicians meander their way up diplomatic cul-de-sacs in their peacemaking efforts, they are the ones who suffer. And, at the same time, their neighbours across the border suffer similarly from the cycle of violence, which is why a military response doesn&apos;t seem the best way out of the impasse. Every Israeli incursion brings a heavier rain of Kassams down on Sderot in response, and it might well be that the only way forward is through negotiations if any long-term truce is to come to fruition. In the meantime, however, the residents of Sderot need to be taken under the wing of a government that, until now, has been woefully reluctant to come to their aid. Evacuating them to safety, whatever the cost, is the least they deserve until the dust settles. Because, as Ruth said sadly, &quot;the worst part of all this isn&apos;t the rocket fire - it&apos;s the fact that the government just doesn&apos;t care&quot;. And, just as she claimed that no other government in the world would allow attacks from across its borders, similarly no decent government should abandon its neediest citizens so in their hour of need.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-18T11:30:00Z", "title": "Sderot: beseiged and abandoned", "sentences": ["&quot;If this was happening in Tel Aviv, it would be dealt with in an instant&quot;, she declared forcefully, accusing the government of ignoring Sderot&apos;s residents simply because they were working class and poor."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/18/sderotbeseigedandabandoned"}, {"tags": ["World news"], "article": "At the Fabian Society conference this weekend, I took part in a panel discussion about how democracies should respond to terrorism. At the Fabian event, and at other similar platforms, I sense a reluctance among fellow panellists to define the beast to which we so often refer.

Or make elusive references to &quot;The Ideology&quot;. What ideology? Let&apos;s assume for a moment that al-Qaida was successfully dismantled. And Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri were put to sleep. Would there still be terrorist attacks? Emphatically, yes. Why? Because the mindset that inspired al-Qaida itself would remain intact. Long before al-Qaida, that mindset was manifest in wanton violence in Luxor, Cairo, Damascus, Algiers and Tel Aviv. And unless we uproot the worldview that underpins contemporary terrorism (the non-Eta variety) then we will continue to be dependant on counter-terrorism measures that threaten civil liberties. Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell are right and courageous to mention &quot;The Ideology&quot; behind terrorism. But somehow there is an assumption that local government, police, university authorities, and others will learn by osmosis about &quot;The Ideology&quot;. The palpable fear and reluctance in naming &quot;The Ideology&quot; speaks volumes about the malaise of the modern west. Worse, the patronising attitude that somehow naming Islamism will result in loss of Muslim support is based on the premise that &quot;the Muslim community&quot; is what the game-players of sectarian politics define it to be. Brits of all backgrounds deserve higher standards and greater transparency from the government. We are not stupid. We can distinguish between Islam the religion, and Islamism the political ideology. A Labour government should know better. I am acutely aware that, at home, candour can mean upsetting those who play the separatist, Muslim representation game. And abroad, the government risks the ire of the mighty Saudi petrol attendants. But being held hostage by these interests, and thus muzzled from explaining &quot;The Ideology&quot; to key stakeholders in public life means that in the long term the security threat will only increase. It is Qutbite Islamism, combined with extreme Wahhabism that produced jihadism. Al-Qaida is only one symptom of this deadly combination. Like most non-Muslims, Muslims are unaware of the difference between Islam and Islamism. Rather than assume that &quot;they won&apos;t get it&quot;, and spend millions of taxpayers&apos; money on foreign wars and domestic surveillance programmes, the government should be transparent and help raise awareness of the true nature of &quot;The Ideology&quot;. Without clearly defining the problem, we can&apos;t even begin to unravel it. Little wonder, then, that the terrorist threat level remains severe. It&apos;s still not too late. In democracies, governments should be transparent when dealing with terrorism.

People who like literature, coming together every so often to talk about the books they&apos;re reading. What on earth can be wrong with that? A lot, apparently, at least going by the reactions from various friends when I told them I was setting one up in Tel Aviv. I have to say that the venom surprised me. But what particularly interested me was the fact that the vitriol came particularly from people who had studied literature or who worked in some capacity in the publishing industry. I didn&apos;t study literature, preferring the seemingly sexier option of history and international relations. But over the last year or two, for a variety of reasons, my reading has almost entirely shifted from non-fiction to fiction. In my excitement, I even considered applying for PhD programmes in English Literature. For now, though, I&apos;m going to settle for my fortnightly book club, which I hope will develop into an opportunity for people passionate about novels to come together and develop a shared understanding of the text through dialogue. As ways of passing the time go, it seems pretty harmless to me. So why the criticism? I think it comes from the same raw nerve that drives the traditional print media&apos;s mistrust of the blog. There&apos;s a deep discomfort at people doing things themselves, for fun, with little concern for profit or fame. &quot;Professionals&quot; are supposed to explain the world to us, and we are meant to pay them for the privilege. By writing a blog, we are cutting out the middleman, and that&apos;s a threat. But book clubs are just talking-shops, not rivals to the Guardian Review. So why this particular antagonism? In the Review, novelist Rachel Cusk described her experience of joining a book club in her new town. What started out as an attempt to get to know new people became a disturbing insight into how most people read. &quot;As if for the first time, I understood that reading is a private matter. In this atmosphere the spell was broken. What remained was a cold, unyielding surface for a writer&apos;s imaginings to fall upon: the permafrost of organised ambivalence.&quot; Cusk found fault with the group&apos;s predilection for using literature as a form of escape from &quot;their ordinary experience of sorrow, of doubt, of morality, of time,&quot; in favour of books that &quot;bore no relation to their own existence&quot;. Eventually, after an impassioned speech extolling the virtues of Chekhov, she left, deciding that her seriousness was not beneficial to the group. Cusk&apos;s experiences are interesting, but they should be taken with a pinch of salt. It would be surprising if a serious, professional novelist like her would be stimulated by talking literature with people for who getting through one novel a month is a struggle. Such a group might not grab someone who has studied literature at university either. But that doesn&apos;t invalidate the enterprise. At the risk of earnestness, there&apos;s something really positive about people meeting up to talk literature, all the more so at a time when - for example - 40% of people in the US read one book or less last year. I am writing this before our first meeting, when we&apos;ll be discussing Anne Enright&apos;s The Gathering. And I have no doubt that I&apos;m not going to be stimulated by everyone&apos;s responses; some will downright irritate me. But that&apos;s to be expected; I&apos;m sure it was the same for my friends who studied literature in their university seminars. Tolerance and patience will hopefully get me through. The point is that it&apos;s exciting to be able to spend time with people who are hopefully as passionate about literature as I am. There&apos;s another critique, though, one I&apos;m not so comfortable with. It&apos;s spelled out in an unpublished letter to the New York Review of Books by Amy Bellette in Exit Ghost:  &quot;If I had something like Stalin&apos;s power, I would not squander it on silencing the imaginative writers. I would silence those who write about the imaginative writers. I&apos;d forbid all public discussion of literature in newspapers, magazines, and scholarly periodicals ... I&apos;d outlaw reading groups and Internet book chatter, and police the bookstores to be certain that no clerk ever spoke to a customer about a book and that the customers did not dare to speak to one another. I&apos;d leave the readers alone with the books, to make of them what they would on their own.&quot;  This elucidates Cusk&apos;s notion of reading as a &quot;private matter&quot;. If there&apos;s one thing that my shift from non-fiction to fiction has taught me, it&apos;s that literature is a humble, quietist activity, one that teaches you how to be comfortable on your own. A novel is written to be read, not to be discussed. Its elucidation is itself. I hope that, amid the chatter of the book club, this won&apos;t be forgotten. I&apos;ll keep you posted ...", "publicationDate": "2008-01-21T21:00:00Z", "title": "Join the club", "sentences": ["A lot, apparently, at least going by the reactions from various friends when I told them I was setting one up in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/21/jointheclub"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "In the last few weeks Bethlehem has played host to some rather unwelcome guests - at least, as far as the Israeli authorities are concerned. First up was a trio of Israeli citizens who were caught in the city, purportedly to &quot;see the town&apos;s fir trees,&quot; an excuse that didn&apos;t cut much ice with the Israeli police. One of the three, a serving soldier who decided to take his M16 along for the trip, received a month in military jail as punishment for his straying into enemy territory. Then, a few days later, another two Israelis were apprehended in the city after apparently going to get their car fixed in a local garage. An army official described their foray as &quot;stupid&quot;, claiming that they &quot;endangered the entire country [with their actions], because they could have been kidnapped&quot;. While accusing them of putting the entire state of Israel at risk might sound hysterical to some, his reaction is in fact par for the course and entirely understandable given the current climate of fear that reigns in the area. Against this backdrop, my flatmate and I decided to make a similar trip to the city this week, along with one of our closest friends, who was visiting from London. We opted to dispense with traditionally saccharine sightseeing - Jerusalem&apos;s Old City, the beaches of Tel Aviv, and so on - and take our guest to see the side of the region that Jews rarely get to see. Clutching our British passports tightly and hoping for an easy passage through the checkpoint, we jumped in a cab and headed for the security wall less than three miles from my house. We were in luck - a bored girl behind the bullet-proof glass of her cubicle waved us casually through, and we were in. Strolling in the weak January sunshine, we made our way to the centre of town, taking in the sights and sounds of the post-intifada version of Bethlehem. Despite being encircled by 30-foot-high concrete slabs and well-manned lookout towers, inside the city life goes on as normally as possible. This isn&apos;t Gaza, where gun-toting militants rule the roost, causing even the most hard-nosed journalists and intrepid aid-workers to think twice about setting foot there. Neither is it laced with the eerie, menacing air that hangs over Jenin&apos;s refugee camp, where years of vicious fighting have taken their toll on the collective psyche and made it a daunting place to visit. Instead, Bethlehem feels as safe and approachable as any town in Israel, no different from Yafo, Nazareth, Kfar Saba or Haifa. The only guns on display are in the hands of the Palestinian policemen patrolling the streets, the same policemen who, far from aiding and abetting a kidnap of the straying Israelis earlier in the month, handed them over to the Israeli authorities with a minimum of fuss. The streets of the souk heave with shoppers buying up everything from entire sheep&apos;s carcasses to six-inch stilettos, and couldn&apos;t feel less threatening to an outsider. Unless, that is, they&apos;ve been fed the propaganda that the Israeli government loves to serve up to its flock. Granted, there is of course previous when it comes to Palestinians attacking Jewish Israelis in the West Bank, but to paint the entire region as a cauldron of terror is a calumny, and done in order to keep Israelis fearful, and therefore in support of the occupation. Less than a decade ago, before the second intifada broke out, Israelis thronged to the markets and shops of the West Bank on a daily basis. They ate in their restaurants, sought bargains in their stores and made personal connections with their Palestinian neighbours that belied the notion that nought but enmity existed on both sides of the divide. Once the uprising broke out, however, the Palestinian-controlled cities became no-go zones for Israelis, and the once-strong links between the two communities were rent apart overnight. The restrictions made sense, in the light of the upsurge in violence, but - now that the intifada has all but died out - it seems entirely counterproductive to continue the separation. At least, it seems counterproductive to those who have an interest in rapprochement between the two peoples. Keeping the Palestinians out of sight behind the security wall allows the media and authorities to portray them in any way they see fit, knowing that no Israelis can challenge their stereotypes by going to see the situation for themselves. For all that Israelis know Bethlehem is a seething mass of gunmen and would-be bombers, just waiting for the chance to unleash their rage on the first Israeli who strays into their path. But, for those - like my friends and me - who ignore the restrictions and prefer to see the state of play for themselves, there is a hell of a lot to be learned by making the trip across, rather than relying on second or third-hand accounts. While I have no doubt that there are still residents of the town who would gladly take up arms for their cause, seeing the city quietly going through the motions on an average day makes a huge difference to my understanding of the conflict. Demonising the &quot;other&quot; is the easiest way to convince a public that an entire people are dangerous enemies who must be avoided at all costs. Israel&apos;s far from alone in its practising of this method - the Daily Mail&apos;s scaremongering about Polish immigrants, the Sun&apos;s rabble-rousing about Gypsies, and so on, are all perfect examples of England&apos;s own hysteria when it comes to people slightly different from themselves. However, when a wall&apos;s in place and a strict ban on even having contact with the &quot;other&quot; is enforced, the sense of separation and fear of what lies beyond the city limits is amplified many times over. And that is one of the most potent weapons in Israel&apos;s arsenal as it seeks to convince its people that we&apos;re better off alone, and better off doing anything we can to keep it that way for years and years to come.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-22T08:00:00Z", "title": "Beyond the city limits", "sentences": ["We opted to dispense with traditionally saccharine sightseeing - Jerusalem&apos;s Old City, the beaches of Tel Aviv, and so on - and take our guest to see the side of the region that Jews rarely get to see."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/22/beyondthecitylimits"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea", "Everton", "Carling Cup 07-08", "Avram Grant"], "article": "Avram Grant&apos;s first taste of Wembley has stayed with him for the wrong reasons. The Chelsea manager came over from Israel to support Liverpool in the 1977 FA Cup final against Manchester United but his limited means landed him in trouble. &quot;I was in the stands, I didn&apos;t have money for another ticket,&quot; he said. &quot;But the supporters almost killed me. I was in the Man United end ... supporting Liverpool. That was the problem by the way. I didn&apos;t know the hat was different.&quot; Grant offered the impression yesterday that he was in no great rush to return to the rebuilt stadium. Chelsea take a 2-1 lead to Everton tonight in the Carling Cup semi-final second leg and while Grant did stress that he wanted to win, as he always does, his priorities lie elsewhere. Chelsea are consumed with success in the Champions League and the Premier League and he suggested that this tie might mean more to Everton, who have not won a trophy since 1995. &quot;I cannot say that it [the Carling Cup] is not important but if you want a true answer, I cannot say that this is the main thing for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I cannot tell you that [winning] it will mean a lot to me. I want to win any game but for me, the main target is other targets. &quot;I understand Everton, I understand clubs that do not take a trophy for a long time. Even if it&apos;s not a major trophy, for them it&apos;s very, very important. I understand them, it&apos;s very reasonable but they need to understand us. We want to win anyway.&quot; Grant&apos;s attitude was not ever thus. The boot was on the other foot when he started out in management at Hapoel Petah Tikva, his home-town club. Having won promotion from the second division, his team reached the Toto Cup final in 1990 and 1991, where they played Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv and Beitar Tel Aviv respectively. The Toto Cup is Israel&apos;s equivalent of the Carling Cup and Grant savoured victory on both occasions. &quot;This is the reason why I understand Everton,&quot; he said. &quot;We were a very small club. We didn&apos;t have a budget even for the tea. We took on the best team in Israel, who were Beitar Tel Aviv, and we were very happy. This is the reason I understand a team like Everton who are not used to taking trophies. Even not major trophies are important to you.&quot; Grant&apos;s honesty might rile Evertonians and provoke a backlash from their team but he did appear to economise with the truth when asked how he celebrated his breakthrough silverware. &quot;I think I took my wife out ... no, I was not married!&quot; he said. &quot;I remember every training session that I made in my life but this I don&apos;t remember. I remember we were happy and that all the team went out to a few bars.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s Carling Cup triumph in 2005 was a breakthrough for Jose Mourinho, Grant&apos;s predecessor, and several members of the squad. The 3-2 victory over Liverpool in the final brought them their first trophy and players, including John Terry, the captain, and Joe Cole, have said that it increased their belief and set them fair for their subsequent honours. Grant has the opportunity to fire his tenure similarly, having only succeeded Mourinho last September, but he played down the parallels. &quot;If you can promise me that if we take the Carling Cup, we will take the Champions League, I will be happy but you cannot,&quot; he said. &quot;I was happy when I won my first trophy [at Petah Tikva] but I cannot say it changed something.&quot; Grant confirmed that Frank Lampard had sustained a further tear to his thigh and would be out &quot;between days to two weeks&quot; while he hoped that Terry, who is recovering from three broken bones in his foot, could be available in &quot;two to three weeks, more or less&quot;. Shaun-Wright Phillips&apos; ankle injury is not serious, although he will not feature tonight, but Grant remained in the dark over Andriy Shevchenko&apos;s back problem that has seen him on the sidelines since Boxing Day. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is too serious but I am not a doctor. Even Sheva doesn&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;My mother wanted me to be a doctor.

Sivasspor, in case you haven&apos;t been paying attention, are the surprise leaders of Super Lig, and the first team to threaten the Besiktas-Fenerbah\u00e7e-Galatasaray stranglehold in a generation. They have been propelled to the summit by incredible home form: played 10, won 10, scored 20, conceded three. In the second half of the season Sivasspor face each of the big three at home. A win over Fenerbah\u00e7e this Sunday will set up the most exciting Turkish title race in recent memory. Sivasspor actually owe much of their new-found success to Fenerbah\u00e7e, and have been rescued from obscurity by the former Istanbul Canaries&apos; midfielder Bulent &apos;The Soldier&apos; Uygun. The 36-year-old Uygun - once a tigerish, goalscoring midfielder in the Frank Lampard mould - has drilled Sivas into a formidable machine of the ugly-winning variety. &quot;We are a professional team,&quot; he explains. &quot;But we have the spirit of amateurs.&quot; A rookie coach, Uygun credits his managerial success to the influence of Carlos Alberto Parreira, the manager who schemed Brazil&apos;s unBrazil-like 1994 World Cup triumph and was responsible for Fener&apos;s mid-90s revival. But equally key to Sivasspor&apos;s success is Uygun&apos;s own training system (nicknamed &quot;Turbulence&quot;) in which players alternate between performance-enhancing fitness binges and prolonged rests, the idea being that form-sapping fatigue can be meticulously scheduled against breaks in the fixture calender. Sivasspor also go heavy on bonding sessions. As their president Mecnun Odyakmaz put it: &quot;Money is not a major concern. We are a brotherhood.&quot; Indeed, while over in neighbouring Greece it&apos;s taken awesome financial backing to move Asteras Tripoli into contention with the big Athenian teams, Sivasspor are a team of anti-stars very much like the Wimbledon of the past. They have a limited squad with average players. Their success depends on speedy counter-attacking football. It says it all that when the club announced they were ready to listen to offers for star player, Mehmet Yildiz, the silence was deafening. The team&apos;s recruitment policy also seems to depend on Fenerbah\u00e7e. During the current transfer window, Mahmut Hanefi and Onur Tuncer have further swelled the Sivas ranks of fallen Fener stars - ranks that have recently included Servet Cetin, Can Arat, Gurhan Gursoy, Ilgar Gurbanov and Gokhan Bozkaya. Despite Sivasspor having &apos;won&apos; the first half of the season, Turkish journalists are dubious they can last the distance. Ebru Koksaldi of Fanatik urges caution. &quot;Remember Real Sociedad in the 2002-03 season?&quot; he says. &quot;They had no stars but 13 or 14 players with incredible motivation. It still wasn&apos;t enough to beat Real Madrid. The next year, they collapsed. Now they are in the second division.&quot; Added to the lack of resources, injury to pivotal Israeli forward Pini Balili - the 28 year-old forward who has bagged seven goals in 29 games for his country, but who muffed his lines during England&apos;s dismal 0-0 draw in Tel Aviv - is also a serious dent to Sivasspor&apos;s chances. &quot;Nobody can say they will be the champions,&quot; says Koksaldi. &quot;But it is clear that they will be the new power in the Turkish league, like Genclerbirligi and Gaziantepspor once were.&quot; Still, from the very beginning, pundits have been expecting steady Sivas to fade as quickly as last season&apos;s great white hopes, Vestel Manisaspor, whose eye-catching start to the 2006-07 season ended in mid-table mediocrity and serious crowd trouble. They&apos;re still waiting. With Anatolian Sivasspor well placed to take advantage of a hostile home climate that can mean games are played in knee-knocking temperatures of below -10C, it may be that the dramatic loss of form never comes. A Uefa Cup place already looks nailed on, but victory on Sunday will further shorten the odds on Sivasspor becoming only the fifth Turkish club ever to win the league title.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-24T12:21:31Z", "title": "Football: Turkish delights continue to surprise", "sentences": ["Now they are in the second division.&quot; Added to the lack of resources, injury to pivotal Israeli forward Pini Balili - the 28 year-old forward who has bagged seven goals in 29 games for his country, but who muffed his lines during England&apos;s dismal 0-0 draw in Tel Aviv - is also a serious dent to Sivasspor&apos;s chances."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jan/24/europeanfootball.fenerbahce"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "In his later years, George Habash, who has died of a heart attack, at an age believed to be 82, was often known as &quot;the conscience of the Palestine revolution&quot;. He had been one of the very earliest founding fathers of that movement, which pioneered armed struggle and revolutionary violence as the sole means of liberating Palestine. Since it first emerged, in the 1960s as a potent new force on the Middle East stage, the movement suffered all manner of vicissitudes, and its ambitions were eventually reduced, almost out of recognition, to an endless series of surrenders to the exigencies of Pax Americana. But, out of sincerity, rather than the opportunism which has tainted other, lesser radicals of his kind, &quot;Al Hakim&quot;(the doctor or wise man), remained faithful to his original conviction that by force - and force alone - could the Palestinians recover their rights. In 1967 he had been the founder, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). and he was to be faithful to his conviction that the rights he was fighting for included the recovery of the whole of original, pre-1948 Palestine, not just the additional territories which the Israelis conquered in 1967. Born in Lydda, coastal Palestine, now part of Israel&apos;s second city Tel Aviv, to a family of Greek Orthodox grain merchants, Habash became a supreme example of that disposition, always latent in the Christian minority in those days, to display a greater militancy than the Moslem majority. There was already an idealistic strain in his choice of careers: like many others, he was a doctor before he was a politician. It was his personal experience of the 1948 disaster which, more than anything else, fired in him a determination to devote himself to the politics of struggle. In 1948, as a 22-year-old undergraduate in medicine at the American University of Beirut he rushed back to Lydda to serve as a medical orderly as the Zionists advanced on the town and drove out its inhabitants. Within three years he and fellow-students from various parts of the Arab world founded the Arab Nationalist Movement, which believed that the Arabs should find the strength-through-unity to throw off western domination: that, in turn, would be the key to the liberation of Palestine. He graduated from university in 1951, first in class. In the first of many a different place of exile, he settled in Amman, where he opened a &quot;people&apos;s clinic&quot; and a school for refugees. Accused of involvement in an attempt to overthrow King Hussein, and driven underground with a 33-year prison sentence on his head, he then fled to Syria, where, by a very natural transition, he became an ardent supporter of Egypt&apos;s President Gamal Nasser, the great pan-Arab hero of the times. But if the price of sincerity can be a certain dogmatism, it was this which - so typically of his subsequent career - brought him into collision with mainstream sentiment in the still clandestine &quot;revolution&quot;. Tiring of Arab inaction, Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrilla organisation had already embarked on their &quot;popular liberation war&quot;. Ironically, Habash at first opposed them, believing that Nasser should be permitted to make conventional war against Israel at a time of his own choosing. In a sense, the shattering defeat of the armies of Egypt. Jordan, Syria and Iraq in the six day war of 1967 proved him right. But then, converted to armed struggle himself, he characteristically took it those extremes which have marked him, ever since, as one of the great patrons of &quot;international terrorism&quot; - though he was never to take on the demoniacal stature of the Venezuelan, Carlos the Jackal (Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez), or his fellow-Palestinian, Abu Nidal. For a brief, heady span, Habash and his newly formedPFLP held the world in thrall. A series of hijackings included the events around Dawson&apos;s Field in September 1970. Two airliners, from Trans-World Airways and Swissair were hijacked to that former RAF base at Zerqa in the Jordanian desert, while an abortive takeover of an El Al airliner by the Nicaraguan Patrick Arguello, and the Palestinian Leila Khaled ended with Arguello dead and Khaled held at Ealing police station. A Pan Am jumbo jet was then hijacked to Cairo, via Beirut, and a British Overseas Airways Corporation VC10 to Dawson&apos;s Field to make the British free Khaled. This outrage helped precipitate Black September, King Hussein&apos;s assault on the guerrilla state-within-his-state, which ended with the King&apos;s victory, the first great strategic reverse in the fortunes of the Palestine &quot;revolution&quot;. An exchange deal at the end of the month followed, freeing the remaining hostages, Khaled, and three other PFLP members. Moving to Beirut, along with the rest of the PLO, Habash persisted in some of the more spectacular, publicity-seeking acts of violence - with the 1972 massacre of tourists at Lod (once Lydda and now Ben Gurion) airport by Japanese Red Army terrorists as perhaps the most successful, if ignoble, of them - but to less and less effect. The whole guerrilla movement was moving away from random terrorism of that kind, and, at the same time, looking more and more to diplomacy, first as a supplement to, then as substitute for, military action.  Habash, the radical, made it his business to resist every new stage of this growing moderation. But when, at the Palestine National Council (PNC) meeting in 1988, Arafat made his historic offer of a two-state solution to the Palestine problem, Habash did not walk out of the PLO altogether. Nor did he, three years later, when the PNC agreed to go to the 1991 Middle East peace conference in Madrid. He said he would respect the will of the majority, however fiercely he opposed it. That loyalty to Palestinian national unity, along with his personal modesty and simplicity, made him perhaps the most liked of the small, still surviving band of the revolution&apos;s original chiefs.  He stood down as PFLP leader in 2000, four years before the death of Yasser Arafat, and six years before the Islamicists of Hamas won their victory in the Palestinian election. Pax Americana meanwhile continues to make paltry progress in its regional diplomacy, and many of those who now so grudgingly support it may well in due course conclude that the &quot;conscience of the revolution&quot; had always been right in opposing it - and the whole concept of Palestinian moderation. In 1961, he married his wife Hilda, and they had two daughters, Mesa, a doctor and Lama, an engineer. \u00b7 George Habash, born 1926; died January 26 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-01-27T14:51:00Z", "title": "Obituary: George Habash", "sentences": ["Born in Lydda, coastal Palestine, now part of Israel&apos;s second city Tel Aviv, to a family of Greek Orthodox grain merchants, Habash became a supreme example of that disposition, always latent in the Christian minority in those days, to display a greater militancy than the Moslem majority."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/27/israelandthepalestinians.obituaries"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "European Union", "Human rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa"], "article": "Unnoticed by most of the world&apos;s news media, a bizarre quarrel has broken out between the EU and the awful Mubarak regime in Egypt. It began on January 17, when the European parliament approved a resolution criticising human rights abuses in Egypt. In particular, it called on the Egyptian government to end its harassment of journalists and human rights defenders, lift the state of emergency, investigate suspected cases of torture and guarantee the independence of the judiciary. Compared to what might have been said, this was pretty mild stuff and, as Bahieddin Hassan, director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, later remarked, its content was &quot;too true to be refuted&quot;. However, the response from President Mubarak&apos;s National Democratic [sic] party, which - thanks to various electoral shenanigans - has an overwhelming majority in the Egyptian parliament, was one of unmitigated fury. Indeed, it was a classic example of something I discussed in a recent article on Cif, where deadbeat regimes that engage in human rights abuses shelter behind specious arguments about religion, national sovereignty and cultural imperialism. On this occasion, it was the turn of Fathi Sorour, Egypt&apos;s parliamentary speaker, to mouth the familiar patter about meddling in internal affairs. &quot;The age of capitulation is over and Egypt no longer accepts the language of foreign dictates,&quot; he fumed, threatening to cut all ties with the European parliament. In the meantime, he would be raising the issue at a meeting of the Union of Muslim Parliaments, which would focus on &quot;Islamophobia in Europe&quot; and &quot;western hostility against Islamic values&quot;. &quot;Egypt is quite capable of opening the scandalous files of human rights abuses in Europe but it will not do this because it respects its historic ties with Europe,&quot; he thundered. No less predictably, other NDP members blamed Israel for the European resolution. Abdel-Ahad Gamaleddin, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary spokesman, said he suspected Tel Aviv of trying to kill two birds with one stone - embarrass Egypt and distract international attention from Israeli atrocities in Gaza. This display of verbal fireworks was presumably intended for domestic consumption by the Egyptian press, but the claim that Europe has suddenly embarked on unwarranted meddling in the country&apos;s internal affairs is unbelievably silly. In 1995, Egypt was one of a dozen non-EU countries - along with 15 EU countries - that voluntarily signed up to the Barcelona Declaration which aims to develop security, stability, trade and cultural cooperation in the Mediterranean region, and also to promote democracy, good governance and human rights. According to al-Ahram Weekly, Egypt receives \u20ac30m a year under the Barcelona process, supposedly for the purpose of developing human rights and good governance - so it can hardly complain if other signatories question what is being achieved with the money. Since 2004, Egypt and the EU have also had an association agreement - one of a series involving Mediterranean countries. These agreements provide important economic benefits but they are not purely about trade; they encompass &quot;cooperation&quot; in many areas, including &quot;political dialogue&quot; and &quot;respect for human rights and democracy&quot;. Again, this was something that the Egyptian government signed of its own accord. Obviously it wanted the economic benefits, but it can&apos;t plead ignorance about the other aspects; they were spelled out in the agreement itself (large pdf file) and the EU has always made clear that &quot;respect for human rights is a fundamental value&quot; of such agreements. At a joint meeting with Egypt in 2006, the EU explained (pdf) this in more detail:  The EU seeks to work with each partner [in Association Agreements] individually, at the appropriate pace, to achieve a significant degree of economic integration as well as deepening of political cooperation and achieve the objectives of a privileged relationship based on mutual commitment to human rights, including the rights of women and rights of persons belonging to minorities, and to shared values, principally within the fields of the rule of law, good governance and democracy ... The relationship will be shaped by the degree of commitment to these common values and principles ...  As part of this process, eight joint committees were set up, including a political committee that is now the official vehicle for EU-Egyptian dialogue &quot;on concrete human rights issues&quot;. This was the context of the European parliament&apos;s resolution on January 17 that got the Egyptian government into such a tizz: it was simply a preparatory step before a meeting of the political committee. Fortunately, not everyone in Egypt has been fooled by the government&apos;s blustering. Independent MP Gamal Zahran said the European resolution should be regarded &quot;not as interference in internal affairs, but as a warning that the state of human rights in Egypt is becoming an international issue&quot;. One particularly interesting reaction came from Hussein Ibrahim, parliamentary spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood, which last week saw hundreds of its supporters arrested (yet again). &quot;The issue of human rights has become a global language,&quot; he told al-Ahram Weekly. &quot;Although each country has its own particulars, respect of human rights is now a concern for all peoples&quot; - though he specifically excluded gay rights from that. Rather than deploring criticism from abroad, he said, the Egyptian government would do better to improve its human rights record - which would then leave less room for foreigners to cause embarrassment.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-28T12:30:00Z", "title": "Foreign dictates?", "sentences": ["Abdel-Ahad Gamaleddin, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary spokesman, said he suspected Tel Aviv of trying to kill two birds with one stone - embarrass Egypt and distract international attention from Israeli atrocities in Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/28/foreigndictates"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "In his later years, George Habash, who has died of a heart attack aged 81 or 82, was often known as &quot;the conscience of the Palestine revolution&quot;. He had been one of the very earliest founding fathers of that movement, which pioneered armed struggle and revolutionary violence as the sole means of liberating Palestine. Since it first emerged, in the 1960s, as a potent new force on the Middle East stage, the movement suffered all manner of vicissitudes, and its ambitions were eventually reduced, almost out of recognition, to an endless series of surrenders to the exigencies of Pax Americana. But, out of sincerity, rather than the opportunism which has tainted lesser radicals of his kind, &quot;Al Hakim&quot; (the doctor or wise man), remained faithful to his original conviction that it was by force - and force alone - that the Palestinians could recover their rights. In 1967 he had been the founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and he was to be faithful to his conviction that the rights he was fighting for included the recovery of the whole of original, pre-1948 Palestine, not just the territories the Israelis conquered in 1967. Born in Lydda, coastal Palestine, now part of Israel&apos;s second city, Tel Aviv, to a family of Greek Orthodox grain merchants, Habash became a supreme example of that disposition, always latent in the Christian minority in those days, to display a greater militancy than the Muslim majority. There was already an idealistic strain in his choice of careers: like many others, he was a doctor before he was a politician. It was his personal experience of the Palestinian disaster involved in the creation of Israel that, more than anything else, fired in him a determination to devote himself to the politics of struggle. In 1948, as a 22-year-old undergraduate in medicine at the American University of Beirut, he rushed back to Lydda to serve as a medical orderly as the Zionists advanced on the town and drove out its inhabitants. Within three years, he and fellow students from various parts of the Arab world founded the Arab Nationalist Movement, which believed that the Arabs should find the strength through unity to throw off western domination: that, in turn, would be the key to the liberation of Palestine. He graduated from university in 1951, first in his class. In the first of many exiles, Habash settled in Amman, Jordan, where he opened a people&apos;s clinic and a school for refugees. Accused of involvement in an attempt to overthrow King Hussein, and driven underground with a 33-year prison sentence hanging over his head, he fled to Syria, where, by a very natural transition, he became an ardent supporter of Egypt&apos;s President Nasser, the pan-Arab hero of the times. But if the price of sincerity can be a certain dogmatism, it was this that - so typically of his subsequent career - brought Habash into collision with mainstream sentiment in the still clandestine revolution. Tiring of Arab inaction, Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrilla organisation had already embarked on their popular liberation war. Ironically, Habash at first opposed them, believing that Nasser should be permitted to make conventional war against Israel at a time of his own choosing. In a sense, the shattering Arab defeat in the six-day war of 1967 proved him right. But then, converted to armed struggle himself, Habash characteristically took it to those extremes which marked him, ever after, as one of the great patrons of international terrorism - though he was never to take on the demoniacal stature of the Venezuelan, Carlos the Jackal (Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez), or his fellow-Palestinian, Abu Nidal. But for a brief, heady span, Habash and his newly formed PFLP held the world in thrall. A series of hijackings came to a spectacular climax at Dawson&apos;s Field in September 1970. Two airliners, from Trans-World Airways and Swissair, were hijacked to a former RAF base in the Jordanian desert, while the abortive take- over of an El Al airliner by the Nicaraguan Patrick Arg\u00fcello and the Palestinian Leila Khaled ended with Arguello dead and Khaled being held at Ealing police station, west London. A Pan Am jumbo jet was then hijacked to Cairo, via Beirut, and a BOAC VC10 to Dawson&apos;s Field to pressurise the British into freeing Khaled. This outrage helped precipitate Black September, King Hussein&apos;s assault on the guerrilla state-within-his-state, which ended with the king&apos;s victory, the first great strategic reverse in the fortunes of the Palestine &quot;revolution&quot;. An exchange deal at the end of the month followed, freeing the remaining hostages, Khaled, and three other PFLP members. Moving to Beirut, along with the rest of the PLO, Habash persisted in some of the more spectacular, publicity-seeking acts of violence - with the 1972 massacre of tourists at Lod (once Lydda and now Ben Gurion) airport by Japanese Red Army terrorists as perhaps the most successful, if ignoble, of them - but to less and less effect. The whole guerrilla movement was moving away from random terrorism of that kind, and, at the same time, looking more and more to diplomacy, first as a supplement to, then as substitute for, military action. Habash, the radical, made it his business to resist every new stage of this growing moderation. But when, at the Palestine National Council (PNC) meeting in 1988, Arafat made his historic offer of a two-state solution to the Palestine problem, Habash did not walk out of the PLO altogether. Nor did he, three years later, when the PNC agreed to go to the 1991 Middle East peace conference in Madrid. He said he would respect the will of the majority, however fiercely he opposed it. That loyalty to Palestinian national unity, along with his personal modesty and simplicity, made him perhaps the most liked of the small, still surviving band of the revolution&apos;s original chiefs. He stood down as PFLP leader in 2000, four years before the death of Arafat, and six years before the Islamicists of Hamas won their electoral victory. Pax Americana, meanwhile, continues to make paltry progress in its regional diplomacy, and many of those who now so grudgingly support it may well in due course conclude that the &quot;conscience of the revolution&quot; had always been right in opposing it - and the whole concept of Palestinian moderation. Habash married his wife Hilda in 1961. They had two daughters, Mesa, a doctor, and Lama, an engineer. \u00b7 George Habash, doctor and revolutionary, born 1926; died January 26 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-01-29T00:17:00Z", "title": "Obituary: George Habash", "sentences": ["Born in Lydda, coastal Palestine, now part of Israel&apos;s second city, Tel Aviv, to a family of Greek Orthodox grain merchants, Habash became a supreme example of that disposition, always latent in the Christian minority in those days, to display a greater militancy than the Muslim majority."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/29/israelandthepalestinians.obituaries"}, {"tags": ["Recommendation sites", "Technology", "Digital media", "Media", "Internet"], "article": "It&apos;s a busy space, that social/local field.

He was on to something. The Latin-splashed prose of the Marxist Perry Anderson, ex-editor of New Left Review, is a world away from the homespun wisdom of paleo-conservative Pat Buchanan. But when it comes to the idea that Israel controls US foreign policy, the ornament of European intellectual culture now chimes with the former Nixon speech writer. According to Buchanan, &quot;Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory&quot; and Congress is &quot;incapable of standing up for US national interests, if Aipac [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] is on the other end of the line&quot;. While &quot;America needs a Middle East policy made in the USA, not in Tel Aviv,&quot; &quot;Bush has pursued the neoconservative&apos;s agenda of endless wars on the Islamic world that serve only the interests of a country other than the one he was elected to preserve and protect&quot;. Writing in the latest New Left Review, Anderson echoes Buchanan. &quot;The Middle East is the one part of the world where the US political system, as presently constituted, cannot act according to a rational calculus of national interest, because it is inhabited by another, supervening interest&quot;. To understand US foreign policy one must first understand &quot;the grip of the Israeli lobby ... on the American political and media system&quot;. Such is the extent of Israel&apos;s power, according to Anderson, &quot;Had Israel opposed the war we can be fairly sure it would not have happened&quot;. The &quot;structural irrationality&quot; of US policy in the Middle East is the power of the Israel lobby. &quot;Circumstantial irrationalities&quot;, such as the invasion of Iraq, are mere surface reflections of this deeper problem. The case against the idea that Israel controls US foreign policy via its &quot;lobby&quot; has been made. (See this post at Jeff Weintraub&apos;s blog.) My concern is with the figure of Anderson himself, since the late 1960s one of the world&apos;s leading intellectuals and the mainstay of the &quot;flagship&quot; theoretical journal of the global left, New Left Review. Why is he now echoing Buchanan&apos;s conspiracy tale? Once upon a time, Anderson, with many of his generation, focused on the positive goal of achieving socialism. However, after 1989, his political and theoretical hopes - which were based on what he called &quot;the workers&apos; states&quot; - collapsed in rubble. Since then, he has been essentially uninterested in (and uncomprehending of) the democratic revolutions of our time, while remaining unreconciled to &quot;bourgeois society&quot; and &quot;liberal democracy&quot; - which he regards as either global evils or miserably cramped horizons which humanity must transcend. In other words, Anderson, along with many others, has retained his negative ontological critique of the entire human condition under capitalism, his militant spirit, and his yearning for transcendence, while lacking a positive political programme, a viable social agency or a cogent strategy. The result is nihilism of a sort. His fury is inchoate, his politics unanchored, and his radicalism is turning rancid. He has &quot;lost his way&quot;. Anderson is no anti-semite. But he has embraced a conspiracy story about an Israeli octopus spreading its controlling tentacles into the US political system and media. And he has decked it out in the language of Marxism, and lent it his lustre.

It wasn&apos;t just that he refused to condemn couples who suddenly discovered that they were, after all, religious churchgoers, with a child anxious to be baptised, for the sole purpose of gaining entry into a desirable, faith-oriented school. He went on: &quot;I think it&apos;s good for parents who want the best for their kids. I don&apos;t blame anyone who tries to get to get their children into a good school.&quot; However dishonestly, is the implication. So presumably it would be acceptable to Cameron for such parents to forge references, distort the kid&apos;s exam results, add a couple of nonexistent but impressive qualifications to their own CVs - provided their motive is to &quot;want the best for their kids&quot;. Should someone aspiring to be our prime minister be so cavalier in supporting - indeed, virtually praising - deception? The fact that Cameron has not been severely castigated for his remarks is itself interesting and depressing. I would hate to believe that the near silence is because his attitude is widely shared by the middle class, whose votes he is so eagerly seeking. I feel differently about those parents who buy property at a premium in order to enter the catchment area of a good state school. They are not doing anything dishonest or reprehensible in seeking the best education for their children. I even feel a little sorry for them. Increasingly, parents who have shelled out well over the odds to make sure of having a home of appropriate proximity are being told that their effort may have been in vain. The criterion for admission, according to a growing number of local education authorities, is no longer solely to be based on living in the catchment area. Instead, there is to be a lottery for some of the places, to give children in less favoured neighbourhoods a chance of going to a better school than the one they would normally be steered to. In terms of social integration and greater equality of educational opportunity, lotteries are a good thing. But the negative effects are equally obvious:a worthy child living near a good school having to travel inconveniently to a lesser one a mile or two away, and the other way round. Opponents of lotteries raise the emotive spectre of children being &quot;bussed&quot; long distances to fulfil political aims. There is injustice in retaining the status quo; equally, in rushing too enthusiastically into the lotteries model. I hardly need to add that this debate would not be needed if our state schools were of more or less equal standard, without the violent fluctuations of quality that bedevil our education system. \u00b7 The acres of media coverage given to the death of Heath Ledger has been excessively disproportionate, exaggeratedly hagiographical and, to me, wholly incomprehensible. In the most recent of the many manifestations of over-the-topness, Daniel Day-Lewis &quot;dedicated&quot; his win at this week&apos;s Screen Actors Guild Awards to Ledger - whom he had never met. I&apos;m not contesting that Ledger was a gifted and versatile actor, who might have - we will never know - developed into a colossus of the cinema. He will be remembered mainly for playing a gay cowboy in the somewhat overrated Brokeback Mountain, in which he was very good, but not stupendous; the same goes for some of his other films. But if he was not yet a great actor, was he - to justify the extraordinary reaction to his death - some kind of icon to a generation (as was James Dean, following Rebel Without a Cause), a symbol of an era, a sex symbol like Monroe, a national totem? None of these. He was a talented, admired, much-liked actor who died far too young in tragic circumstances. That is not enough to explain the inordinate adulation and media space that has been granted to him. \u00b7 We have become accustomed to governments promiscuously handing out apologies to any group that feels its members have not been treated well in the past, however long ago. Until now, the recipients of these sorry-notes have tended to be the descendants of victims of oppression based on race, religion, tribe or ethnicity. The state of Israel has now broken new ground in accepting that a &quot;group&quot; to which cruelty has been done can include a musical group, and that the cruelty involved can be the cancellation of a planned gig. Israel, through its ambassador in Britain, has sent an official letter to the two surviving Beatles, and to relatives of the deceased members (the one to John Lennon&apos;s sister delivered personally), apologising for the state&apos;s decision to ban the group from performing in Tel Aviv in 1965. The letter, quoted by an Israeli newspaper, doesn&apos;t merely say sorry. It provides motives and reasons, refers to a misunderstanding and a missed opportunity, and explains that the government of the time feared that the presence of the Beatles would corrupt Israeli youth. Of course, no apology can ever undo the grievous wrong done to the group, but at least Paul and Ringo can go to their graves freed of the great burden of injustice that has blighted their lives.

Around 50 people gathered on a prominent street corner in the centre of town, decked out in keffiyehs and waving oversized Palestinian flags, cheering noisily at the vitriolic rhetoric being shouted into a loudhailer by one of their number. Placards in English, Arabic and Hebrew were displayed proudly for the benefit of the onlooking photographers. &quot;Israel is committing war crimes,&quot; &quot;end the occupation&quot; and other such slogans were the order of the day, and the longer the demonstration lasted, the more energised the protestors became, singing and chanting incessantly as a couple of bored-looking policemen kept an eye on the proceedings. They had good reason to look relaxed - after all, similar protests had been taking place the length and breadth of the country in response to the recent escalations in Gaza, and the participants were not interested in violence, just seeking to voice their disapproval against the ongoing hostilities. But the difference here was that, although the members of the crowd were Israeli citizens, they were also Arabs - and that double status added a certain edge to the affair that set it apart from other demonstrations in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and elsewhere. Israelis have never quite come to terms with the Arabs in their midst, who remained within Israel&apos;s borders after the War of Independence and today represent around 20% of the country&apos;s population. Israeli Arabs don&apos;t serve in the army, something that causes consternation to many Israelis, who view their refusal to even do any kind of national service for the country as evidence that their loyalties lie elsewhere. At the same time, according to Abbas Zakur - an Israeli-Arab MK who was leading the protest in Akko - Israeli Arabs have good reason to distrust their Jewish counterparts in return, who &quot;continue to discriminate against our people, treating us as second class citizens.&quot; As far as he&apos;s concerned, once the conflict with the Palestinians is resolved - &quot;by way of two states for two people&quot; - he&apos;d be happy to remain living in Israel, &quot;but only when the government treats us as equal.&quot; Citing Akko&apos;s mixed community of Arabs and Jews as a model that the rest of the country should emulate, Zakur assured me that &quot;we all want peace - we&apos;re not traitors in the slightest.&quot; However, he was quick to point out that loyalty to Israel didn&apos;t mean that Israeli Arabs couldn&apos;t also be &quot;part of the Palestinian people, as well as the Arab nation.&quot; It is precisely this stance of having a foot in both camps that leaves the Israeli-Arab community stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to their status. One boy I know from the village of Abu Ghosh on the outskirts of Jerusalem complained that West Bank Palestinians refer to him and his family as &quot;coconuts&quot;, thanks to their decision to remain within Israel and play an active part in Israeli society. Similarly, given the physical separation that exists between Jews and Arabs in most parts of the country (with the notable exceptions of Haifa, Akko and a few other towns), it is no surprise that Israeli Arabs feel equally rejected by their Jewish counterparts. Interaction is reduced to weekend shoppers looking for bargains in Arab towns, or sightseers like myself who head to Nazareth or Akko to take in the scenery before heading back again to the other side of the divide. And in the vacuum that is left, it&apos;s no surprise that academics like Bernard Avishai warn of an internal intifada being on the cards, &quot;that will dwarf anything that&apos;s gone on in the West Bank and Gaza.&quot; Race riots instigated by communities feeling neglected or hard done by are hardly exclusive to this part of the world, and if the Israeli Arabs continue to be merely tolerated, rather than embraced, by the rest of Israeli society, then predictions of a violent reaction don&apos;t seem far fetched at all. In the meantime, however, although they have every right to protest the government&apos;s actions in Gaza, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder whether the protesters I witnessed weren&apos;t shooting themselves in the foot when it came to giving off positive signals to their Jewish neighbours. It shouldn&apos;t be that way - as in, Israeli Arabs should be just as free to show solidarity with the Gazans as leftwing Jewish Israelis are - but the truth is that a picture tells a thousand words. And the picture any passing Israeli saw in Akko was one of a group of Israeli citizens flying the flag of Israel&apos;s opponents, screaming slogans in Arabic and in doing so playing up to the stereotype used by racist politicians like Avigdor Liebermann who (falsely) portrays Israeli Arabs as the &quot;enemy within&quot;. Unfortunate though it is, when tensions are as high as they are at the moment, keeping out of the melee might actually be to the benefit of the Israeli Arabs, rather than giving their enemies more rope with which to hang them.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-02T16:00:00Z", "title": "Between a rock and a hard place", "sentences": ["But the difference here was that, although the members of the crowd were Israeli citizens, they were also Arabs - and that double status added a certain edge to the affair that set it apart from other demonstrations in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and elsewhere."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/02/betweenarockandahardplac"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Liverpool&apos;s Yossi Benayoun had a narrow escape yesterday when the southern Israeli town of Dimona was the target of a suicide attack.

Amnon Raz, the technical director of the Israeli FA, said: &quot;It will be hard to teach Avram Grant football but we don&apos;t look at the names of the coaches.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-02-05T01:25:05Z", "title": "Football: Grant starts Pro Licence studies", "sentences": ["Meetings mostly take place in Tel Aviv or at the coaches&apos; teams."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/05/newsstory.chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Arms trade", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "As Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, finalises his report on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, has been promoting the &quot;historic idea&quot; of a Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction. This overlaps with a goal adopted by the UN security council back in 1991 when resolution 687 talked about &quot;the establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the region of the Middle East&quot;. The resolution, approved after the expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, had eight paragraphs dealing with Iraq&apos;s programmes in biological, chemical, and nuclear arms, and made clear that sanctions were to be lifted if, and only if, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN inspectors had given Iraq a clean bill of health regarding its WMD activities. Paragraph 14 notes &quot;that the actions under paragraphs 8-13 of this resolution represent steps towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery and the objective of a global ban on chemical weapons&quot;. However, there is a subtle but important difference between a WMD-free Middle East and the establishment of a WMD-free zone &quot;in&quot; the Middle East as set out in resolution 687. The resolution does not attempt to define the zone (at least, not beyond Iraq) and the word &quot;in&quot; suggests such a zone might not apply to the whole of the Middle East. Presumably this omission was not accidental, though the idea of a WMD-free zone covering only parts of the region makes no sense. The objective of a Middle East free of WMDs can be achieved only if Israel is also declared free of them by IAEA and other UN inspectors. In defiance of the security council resolution 487 of June 1981, Israel has not placed its nuclear facilities, whether civilian or military, under IAEA safeguards. Indeed, while it is an open secret that Israel&apos;s nuclear facility at Dimona started producing atom bombs in 1968, and that it has built up an arsenal of some 200 nuclear bombs, it has not officially acknowledged the existence of such activity. Moreover, Israel has ongoing biological and chemical weapons programmes. The Israeli Institute for Biological Research (IIRB) at Nes Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, established in 1952, is the Israeli military and intelligence community&apos;s front organisation for developing, testing and producing biological and chemical weapons. Access to Nes Ziona is denied even to the members of the Israeli parliament&apos;s foreign affairs and defence committees concerned about the health risks to the residents of the area. The US Office of Technology Assessment for Congress reported in 1993 that Israel had &quot;undeclared offensive chemical warfare capabilities&quot; and was &apos;generally reported as having an undeclared offensive biological weapons programme.&apos; In that year the Israeli government acknowledged that Marcus Klinberg, deputy head of the IIRB, was given 20 years sentence in solitary confinement in 1983 for leaking information on Israel&apos;s biological weapons programme to the Soviet Union. In 1998, despite the protest by Nes Ziona&apos;s residents, the government extended the IIRB site by a further 41 acres. Unless Washington takes a lead on turning the spotlight on Israel&apos;s WMD, the idea of the WMD-free Middle East will remain empty rhetoric.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-07T10:30:00Z", "title": "A nuclear-free mirage", "sentences": ["The Israeli Institute for Biological Research (IIRB) at Nes Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, established in 1952, is the Israeli military and intelligence community&apos;s front organisation for developing, testing and producing biological and chemical weapons."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/07/anuclearfreemirage"}, {"tags": ["US news", "Barack Obama", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "I live in Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy, and yesterday I voted for Barack Obama, an inspired African-American, for president. Tears streamed down my face as I left the voting booth. I realised for the first time how much I hope that he wins, and I admitted to myself how vulnerable that makes me. At the Martin Luther King memorial I went to last month here at the University of Richmond, the speaker read from King&apos;s Letter from a Birmingham Jail: &quot;We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&quot; It hit me how true that was, and how much Americans get right. I grew up in Israel, and during my last visit there I felt the interconnectedness of the violence of that place in a way I never had before. I felt the hatred and the heartbreak and the hopelessness seeping like sap from everywhere, from the ambient near-fistfight atmosphere in every interaction. I felt it in the venom with which a minibus driver shouted at a migrant worker who didn&apos;t want to pay for her five year old son &quot;Go back to Africa,&quot; and from the look on the boy&apos;s face as he watched their shouting match quietly, resignedly, understanding that this is the world, a battle. I felt the poison walking on the beach in Tel Aviv - beautiful, sunny, blue skied Tel Aviv - because I knew that my mere presence there is so offensive to some people they want to kill me, want to kill themselves in order to kill me. And it hit me in Jerusalem, walking through bucolic, placid streets where Jews live in Arab houses, houses in which people who are still alive have memories. There are realities, a past that cannot be changed, but in Israel we have no hope, not now. We are in a holding pattern, watching as generals and bureaucrats sink us further into the mud. Imagine, just imagine what a leader with a heart would do for us. We are waiting. Flying back from Tel Aviv to Richmond was, as always, soothing. Richmond, where you get to a four-way stop sign and everybody stops. And marching through campus with students and faculty on MLK day, I thought: these American feel-good gestures, which the Israeli in me rolls her eyes at, there&apos;s something to them. These Americans, and the Richmonders I&apos;ve met in particular, they get something right. With good will and gentleness, they are working hard, imperfectly, but working hard nevertheless at healing this bloody, bloody history which here in Richmond is so recent. And what a gift it would be if we had a president who would stoke this flame. And what a shame these past seven years. Abu Ghraib and leaving the bodies of Katrina victims to rot in the streets while Brownie did a heck of a job and reading My Pet Goat as firefighters climbed up against the tide of fleers to rescue as many as possible. How have seven years of Bush affected our hearts? Imagine 9/11 with Obama at the helm? I woke up that morning in lower Manhattan to the sound of sirens, and I, like others, thought this might be the third world war, and it affected me and my relationships in ways I still do not understand. But I know that if we had someone who left that classroom and led us - led us with courage and heart - everything would have been different. Obama will win. We have to believe this.

In the course of that epic odyssey, I made the following entry in my notebook: &quot;The wind sucks and blows. The sea licks the lip of the rock, the constant, repeated, slightly shifting pattern of sound; partially sunk bottle lifting lightly in the transparent, sun-mottled sea. Mellow with sensations growing with food and wine. Grilled octopus, grilled fish of some kind; warm, slow, moving freckles of light on water; painted boat, stubby raised bows, dropping away to low sterns; heat, breeze; mind increasingly undecided; widening sense of grace and humour that alcohol at its best brings; Saki at lunch after a morning of Hemingway.&quot; OK, OK, it&apos;s a bit over the top. Totally over the top, actually, but I was young then, and full of hope, and I think it kind of captures some of the lyrical spirit that suffuses the soul when eating beside the sea.  My love of marine munching was kindled some years earlier, on a family holiday to Cervia on the Adriatic, where, every Thursday in the Hotel Mare e Pineta (Viale Dante 40, 0039 0544 992262), there was a buffet of Lucullan proportions, embracing every kind of seafood - lobsters, crabs, scampi, prawns, shrimps, mussels, clams of infinite variety and fish in as many forms as the chefs imagination could devise. But, to be truthful, it wasn&apos;t this that held me in true rapture at the time, it was the man walking along the beach with ice creams and fruits encased in a friable coating of caramel as delicate as a butterfly&apos;s wing, crying out &quot;ArroriviagelatievitaminiBB&quot;. Since then eating by the sea, on the sea, looking out to sea, has had an inexpressible magic for me, and the places where I have done it have a particularly happy niche in my gastronomic memory. I once ate five lobsters one after another on an island off the coast of Maine (gross, but I knew that I would never have the chance to do it again). I sat in a restaurant in Portonovo in Italy 40 years ago, waiting impatiently for the boats bringing fresh mussels for dinner. There was a wonderful fish and chip shop in Brighton run by an ex-policeman who would only use fish caught by the boats that were then drawn up on the shingle in front of Brighton. Long gone, now, sadly.  At the Osteria Antica Marina - which springs up when the great fish market in Catania in Sicily closes down each day - I feasted on crunchy little fried polpetti; sarde a beccafico; octopus affogato, with onion and potato in a white wine reduction; marinated anchovy fillets, soft as cooked pasta, light and clean; raw prawns peeled, baby-pink, made lively by a hint of chilli; more octopus, cold and springy in oil, parsley and trace of garlic; sarde in agrodolce, bread-crumbed, fried and then marinated in vinegar and sugar with onions and sultanas.  At the estuary of the Keiskamma river at Hamburg on the Siskei coast in South Africa I have spent long, luxurious hours sucking down oysters and dissecting piri-piri chicken at Dorego&apos;s, watching the pelican pottering on the sandy flats.  I remember The Three Chimneys on the Isle of Skye (Colbost, Dunvegan, 01470 511258, threechimneys.co.uk), where the langoustine and crabs and oysters from the sea lochs beyond the windows seem to have leapt from the chilly water straight on to the plate. I have lingered over spaghetti con ricci, spaghetti with sea urchins, vivid with a whole seabed of sea urchins&apos; roes at Da Vittorio in Portopalo in Sicily (via Friuli Venezia Giulia 9, +092 578 381, davittorioristorante.com). In Sri Lanka  I have stared out from an unnamed beach shack on stilts at the aquamarine waters of the Indian Ocean and watched fishermen haul in their catch for the day&apos;s shellfish curry.  What was it that fellow wrote? &quot;Mellow with sensations growing with food and wine... warm, slow, moving freckles of light on water.&quot; He hasn&apos;t changed that much.  \u00b7  Sweet Honey, Bitter Lemons: Travels in Sicily on a Vespa by Matthew Fort will be published by Ebury Press on April 3, \u00a310.99 paperback original. Kaikoura, New Zealand Kaikoura, up the wild eastern coast of South Island from Christchurch, is known for two sea creatures: the dusky dolphins that play offshore and the crayfish (kaikoura means &quot;cray food&quot;) which are caught in craypots along the coastline. In the summer months of October to April, several 100-800-strong pods of duskies come close to shore. Dolphin Encounter (dolphin.co.nz, \u00a360pp) takes boats out to view them - there are no artificial lures and no falsely engineered touching. Later, buy juicy crayfish the size of lobsters from roadside vans or at leisure at the Craypot Caf\u00e9 (0064 3 319 6027, craypot.co.nz). \u00b7  Hire a camper van from \u00a315 a day, from Escape Rentals (escaperentals.co.nz).  B\u00e9lon Estuary, France Every August Lorient, on the south coast of Brittany, hosts the Interceltic Festival of music (festival-interceltique.com) where you can live out your Asterix and Obelix fantasies. And the B\u00e9lon river estuary boasts the best oyster beds in the world. Hanging over the estuary, looking out at the oyster ropes, is the at times frenetic, at times peaceful Chez Jackie (0033 2 98 06 90 32, chez-jacky.com) definitely adventure playground food. \u00b7  For a range of g\u00eetes and B&amp;Bs, go to gitesbrittany.net. Orford, Suffolk The Suffolk coastal village attracts both nature and military history enthusiasts because of Orford Ness, the largest vegetated shingle spit in Europe (although that sounds like a lot of qualifiers, it is an impressive sight). It is home to birds such as the marsh harrier, bearded tit and, particularly, the little tern. But you can also see signs of weapons testing during both world wars and, later, by the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. Orford itself is a quiet village, home to the seafood treasure trove, the Butley Orford Oysterage (01394 450277, butleyorfordoysterage.co.uk). After dining on pints of prawns and skate in the 50s-style cafe, all benches and Formica, raid the smokehouse for eel, sprats and cod roe.  \u00b7  The Old Butcher&apos;s Shop B&amp;B (01394 450517, oldbutchers-orford.co.uk), doubles from \u00a360. West Coast Trail, Vancouver Island, Canada Regularly voted &quot;best hike in the world&quot;, this 50-mile path down the coast of Vancouver Island was first cut to maintain a telegraph line along the island. It then became a rescue route for shipwrecked sailors. Now, a limited number of permits are issued each day to hikers (independent travellers call 001 250 387 1642 and pay C$70). Along the way you see waterfalls and old-growth forest, cliffs and bogs; climb ladders, cross rivers on fallen logs and pull yourself across gorges on cable cars; and consult tide tables to avoid being trapped on beaches. Although you need to carry most of your food, there are two places to eat along the way - a crab shack selling salmon and other seafood and Chez Monique&apos;s, famous for its burgers. \u00b7  Frontier Travel (frontier-canada.co.uk) offers transfers to the trailhead, guiding, camping equipment, food on the hike and licence, from \u00a3880, not including flights or hotels, or from \u00a31560, including flights to Vancouver, three nights in Vancouver, one night in Victoria. Loch Linnhe, Argyllshire This sea loch is almost perfect enough to have been designed by commercial directors. It combines views of the western Grampians, including Ben Nevis, with those of the islands of Lismore and Mull. And in the summer, the sun sets at the loch&apos;s mouth, as if the water was lined up for it. Remote and beautiful as it is, Loch Linnhe is set up for activities: mountain biking, canyoning and rock climbing on land; sailing and sea kayaking on the water. All of these can be arranged by the Pierhouse Hotel - it has its own moorings for yachts. Scallops, crab, langoustines, mussels and lobster are all caught in the loch itself; smoked salmon comes from Inverawe, a few miles south. \u00b7  The Pierhouse (01631 730302, pierhousehotel.co.uk) doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B Kittery Point, Maine, US One of the less flashy spots on the eastern seaboard, Kittery Point is no Hampton&apos;s or Martha&apos;s Vinyard. It does have historical buildings dating back to the 17th century and the Rachel Carson national wildlife refuge. This 5,000-acre site, stretching 50 miles along the Maine coast, incorporates dunes, beaches, salt flats, tidal estuary and crashing Atlantic waves. It is home to terns, plovers and loons, as well as many species of hawk. You may also see white-tailed deer, moose, mink and even black bears. It is free to visit. This part of Maine is famous for its fisheries and lobster pots. As well as Maine lobster, the local speciality is clams (or, Family Guy fans, quahogs). Head to Chauncey Creek (16 Chauncey Creek Road, Kittery Point, 001 207 439 1030, chaunceycreek.com), a simple BYO shack on a pontoon off route 103, for \u00a32 clam chowder, half a dozen cherrystones (large clams) at \u00a34 and, if you&apos;re still hungry after that, lobster at market price. \u00b7  Stay at Chickadee B&amp;B (001 207 439 0672, chickadeebandb.net), a colonial clapboard house with veranda; doubles from $105 B&amp;B. Anegada Reef Hotel, British Virgin Islands Eating lobster on a pristine white sand beach, looking out on the Caribbean sea, is usually the preserve of those with the deepest of pockets, but Anegada, the northernmost of the British Virgin Islands, is different. The Anegada Reef is not a designer boutique hotel but it does have direct access to the beach. Offshore, Horseshoe Reef is the Caribbean&apos;s largest (and the world&apos;s third largest) barrier reef, and the coral atoll is home to a vast array of marine life (and a resting place for wrecks). The dive company at the hotel has exclusive rights to dive the reef, which is now protected. You can also go deep sea fishing for tuna, mahi mahi and marlin. Eat your catch barbecued, along with that lobster, on the beach. \u00b7  From US$120pp full board, diving or fishing extra (00284 495 8002, anegadareef.com). Wingjet (wingjettravel.com) has flights from \u00a3625. Old Port, Tel Aviv, Israel  It is the artistic centre of Israel, with a thriving beach, cafe and club culture, but Tel Aviv&apos;s history goes back only 99 years. It is the city Tel Aviv swallowed up, Jaffa, where real history is found - it has been a port for 4,000 years. It&apos;s also the centre of Tel Aviv&apos;s push for foodie recognition. At the top end, there are Michelin aspirants such as Catit (catit.co.il); but, according to Cooking In The Danger Zone presenter Stefan Gates, there are also restaurants which inspire queues, such as Benny Hadayag - Benny the Fisherman - (00972 3 681 3894), where people enjoy lingering, many-dished seafood meals. \u00b7  Thomsonfly (thomsonfly.com) flies to Tel Aviv from \u00a3140 return. The Bauhaus-style Center Hotel (atlas.co.il) doubles from US$95 B&amp;B. Cape Town, South Africa The coastline around Cape Town is heaving with excellent (and affordable) restaurants, most with great views - mountains behind, bays curving around you, long beaches and wildlife seemingly unbothered by your presence. Food writer Jenni Fleetwood recommends working up an appetite walking along the golden beach in Hout Bay, pausing to watch fur seals biding their time with a little backstroke before the fishing boats return to port. Then go to The Lookout Deck (Look Out Beach, 0027 44 533 1379, lookout.co.za), jutting out over the harbour, for grilled calamari, mussels or hake and chips with a Windhoek lager. In False Bay, go to The Black Marlin (Main Road, Millers Point,+21 786 1621, blackmarlin.co.za), where you have to compete with baboons to eat your fishcakes, prawns and kinglip.  \u00b7  Six nights at the four-star B&amp;B Tarragona Lodge in the hills overlooking Hout Bay, including flights and car hire, from \u00a31,125pp with African Pride (african-pride.co.uk).", "publicationDate": "2008-02-16T00:03:32Z", "title": "100 foodie breaks: seaside", "sentences": ["Old Port, Tel Aviv, Israel  It is the artistic centre of Israel, with a thriving beach, cafe and club culture, but Tel Aviv&apos;s history goes back only 99 years.", "It is the city Tel Aviv swallowed up, Jaffa, where real history is found - it has been a port for 4,000 years.", "It&apos;s also the centre of Tel Aviv&apos;s push for foodie recognition.", "\u00b7  Thomsonfly (thomsonfly.com) flies to Tel Aviv from \u00a3140 return."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/feb/16/top100foodbreaks.seafood"}, {"tags": ["Foreign policy", "Freedom of information", "Politics", "Israel", "Iraq", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "I, Neil Wigan, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1A 2AH, the United Kingdom, make this statement in support of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Appellant in these proceedings. Personal Background 1. I am currently the head of the Arab, Israel and North Africa Group at the FCO. I am responsible for bilateral relationships with countries in the above regions, including Israel. I have held this post since February 2006. Prior to holding this post I was head of the Political Section in the British Embassy in Tel Aviv, a post which I held from August 2002 until January 2006. The disputed information 2. I was shown a copy of the document which is the subject of this information request for the first time on Monday 15 October 2007. I have considered the marginal, handwritten notes on the document and have read those of them which are legible to me. I am not aware who wrote the notes. 3. On page 3 of the document, I refer to the marginal references in the first paragraph to Israel. The reference to Israel is linked (by a hyphen) to a sentence which reads: &quot;No other country has flouted the United Nations&apos; authority so brazenly in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction&quot;. I interpret this note to indicate that the person who wrote it believes that Israel has flouted the United Nations authority in a manner similar to that of the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. 4. I have read the remaining marginal notes in the document and those do not appear to me to relate to Israel. As such my concerns in relation to the marginal notes on the document are limited to those adjacent to the first paragraph on page 3 referred to above. 5. I believe that if these comments were released into the public domain, this would seriously damage our bilateral relations with Israel. In my view, Israel will, in seeing these comments believe that the FCO has firstly, compared the Israeli regime to that of Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq, and secondly, suggested that Israel has flouted the authority of the United Nations in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Although the author of the marginal notes is unknown, I believe that the Israeli government would consider it likely that they would have been written by a senior figure. The assumption could, and I believe would, easily be made that these marginal notes represent the views of the FCO in relation to Israel. 6. Both the comparison with Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq and an implied accusation of a breach of the UN&apos;s authority by Israel are potentially very serious. In my view it is inevitable that the relations between the UK and Israel would suffer if the reference in page 3 of the Williams draft were allowed to enter the public domain. 7. I am confident of this because of my extensive experience working in that region.  During the last five years or so working in both the British Embassy in Tel Aviv and as Head of the Arab, Israel and North Africa Group at the FCO here in London, I gained much experience of handling difficult bilateral issues concerning Israel, anticipating potential issues, and trying to minimise the damage from them.  I have seen that far more minor matters than this have been of great concern to the Israeli authorities. Unfortunately there is a perception already in Israel that parts of the FCO are prejudiced against the country. These notes would therefore confirm this pre-existing suspicion and would increase the damage.  During the last five years there were approximately 10 substantial incidents and 20 more minor ones relating to Israeli concerns over perceived attitudes about their regime within the British government. 8. I am certain that the release of this information would be given a large amount of attention in the media in the UK. Any news in relation to Israel is high profile at present, and in particular, and (sic) criticism of Israel receives a huge amount of media coverage. This would give the comments high profile. Not only that but in my view the Israeli government would also raise this with the foreign secretary and would brief the United Kingdom, Israeli and international media about the existence of the comments and Israeli concerns in relation to them. 9. That would be particularly damaging at this time. The region of Israel and Palestine is currently experiencing a time of extreme regional fragility and relations are particularly delicate.  Furthermore, in November this year there is a major conference taking place which will lead to a key period of diplomatic relations between those nations and the UK. The conference is a US sponsored conference on the Middle East peace process. The FCO will play an important role in supporting that conference and will be closely involved in events following the conference. Ensuring its success is a key priority for this department. Public interest 10. For the reasons given above I believe that our bilateral relations would be affected very seriously by the disclosure of this report. This would not be in the public interest test for the following reasons. 11. Harming our bilateral relations with Israel would in turn affect the UK&apos;s ability to pursue a wide range of international objectives as set out in a white paper entitled Active Diplomacy for a Changing World: the UK&apos;s International Priorities launched in 2006.  That white paper analyses the changes we are likely to see in the world over the next decade and the UK&apos;s role in the international system and identifies the international priorities for the UK over that period.  Of those international priorities my concern is that harming relations with Israel would undermine the FCO&apos;s ability to pursue &quot;strategic priority three&quot; the objective of which is preventing and resolving conflict through a strong international system. 12. Resolving conflict includes resolving both the Israeli/Palestine conflict as well as the Arab/Israeli conflict in the Middle East.  Both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have indicated that it is a priority for the UK to achieve a peaceful solution to conflict in that region, not only because of British interests in those countries (more than 10 British nationals have been killed in Israel and Palestine since 2000 and in the summer of 2006, around 2,500 British nationals were evacuated from Lebanon because of the Israeli/Lebanon conflict), but in our broader regional interest. There is also an important national interest in relation to counter-terrorism. 13. In his most recent statement to the House of Commons on Iraq [made on [ ] the prime minister referred to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and said that he had come back from the region convinced of the need to address the conflict as a priority. 14. The bilateral relationship between the UK and Israel is a key part of our ability to advance peace in relation to the Israel/Palestine and Arab/Israeli conflict. Good relations with Israel are essential in this regard; without active and constructive engagement and by (sic) Israel conflict resolution is impossible. 15. In my view it is almost certain that the release of this information would prejudice relations between the UK and Israel and that the public interest favours protecting it for the reasons given above. Statement of Truth I believe the facts stated in this witness statement to be true to the best of my knowledge and belief.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-21T02:26:00Z", "title": "The FO's case to the information tribunal", "sentences": ["Prior to holding this post I was head of the Political Section in the British Embassy in Tel Aviv, a post which I held from August 2002 until January 2006.", "During the last five years or so working in both the British Embassy in Tel Aviv and as Head of the Arab, Israel and North Africa Group at the FCO here in London, I gained much experience of handling difficult bilateral issues concerning Israel, anticipating potential issues, and trying to minimise the damage from them."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/israelandthepalestinians.iraq1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Since Talmudic times, Jews have been effectively prohibited from gambling by rabbinic authorities, who frowned on the pastime and called it an act of thievery. Gamblers were prevented from appearing as witnesses in Jewish courts, since they were deemed to be morally unfit to take the stand during a trial - and the proscription on betting has filtered down the centuries, permeating modern Israel&apos;s legislature as well. Despite the draconian measures taken to prevent Israelis gambling, it is estimated that over $3.5bn of illegal wagers are made every year within Israel&apos;s borders, and - since none of the money is taxed - the government is missing a golden opportunity to swell its own coffers and redress the appalling level of poverty in the country. However, whenever the spectre of legal casinos and betting shops rears its head, religious Israelis are swift to shout down the proposals and demand that no such action is taken, regardless of the positive effect it would have on the population. Make no mistake - Israelis love to gamble, and aren&apos;t impeded one bit by the official ban on the activity. For years, casino boats have drawn Israelis on board like moths to a flame, sailing into international waters and allowing them to sate their betting appetite to their hearts&apos; content. Similarly, by preventing Israelis physically walking into a betting shop, all the government does is drive them into the welcoming arms of the online bookies, or even into the still-legal world of foreign exchange trading - which is simply another form of roulette in all but name. I just got from back a weekend in Eilat, the southernmost city in Israel which sits on the Red Sea coast in an arid, desert plain. It is as far removed both physically and metaphorically from &quot;Israel proper&quot; as any other place in the country, and seems to only exist to provide a getaway for Israelis and foreigners to pursue hedonistic indulgences. Against the pitch black Negev backdrop, the glare of the hotel strip is immediately reminiscent of Vegas, which is what Eilat aspires to be, and - if the authorities saw sense - that&apos;s exactly what it ought to become. The city is crying out for a casino, which would send much-needed tax revenue the government&apos;s way, while at the same time appeasing opponents of gambling by keeping the vice well out of reach of the rest of the country. It would avoid the pitfall of the likes of the Edgware Road casinos, whose position in the centre of town provide an all-too tempting alternative to drunken revellers than retiring to bed with their money still in their pockets. Israel has a strange relationship with modernity and western values - at times embracing liberalism with a bear hug, and on other occasions rearing back from change like a startled mare. The recent controversy over the Sextival in Tel Aviv was one such incident where Israelis were forced to come to terms with their country&apos;s gradual shift towards laissez-faire ethics over the last couple of decades - and the event&apos;s success left a bitter taste in many disapproving mouths. Separating church and state was never going to be easy in a country ostensibly set up to cater for people of a certain religion rather than of a particular nationality. The country perennially wrestles with the thorny issue of whether state-owned companies can operate on Shabbat - such as public buses, the El Al airline, and even the national grid. However, given that Israel prides itself on being a democracy surrounded by a sea of religious or military dictatorships, it is high time that it put religion to one side and aped the actions of the real democracies that flourish to the west of its shores. It doesn&apos;t mean that casinos have to be legalised in order to demonstrate Israel&apos;s willingness to modernise, but given that the only real opposition is based on religious doctrine rather than on sociological grounds, it would set a valuable precedent if the gambling industry was brought in from the cold. And even some of the religious objectors might soften their stance this time round, given their fury at some of the past alternatives that sprang up in the vacuum left by the ban on gambling. When the Palestinian Authority sanctioned the Jericho casino in the wake of the Oslo Accords, Israelis flocked across the border in droves, pouring millions of dollars into the casino&apos;s coffers, which incensed many rightwing hardliners who described the phenomenon as no more than theft of Jewish money on a national scale. They can&apos;t have it both ways - as in, they can&apos;t stop gamblers gambling, so they should like it or lump it when it comes to where the bets are laid. Given that someone will always find a way to part fools from their money, and given that the house always wins, surely it would be preferable to the religious nationalists that their own country reaps the benefits of the gambling craze. And, if the government wakes up to this fact and rescinds the ban, it would be of great solace to those Israelis who want to feel that their country believes in personal freedom, rather than falling back on ancient religious dictates in order to frame the country&apos;s legal system. Since we are so quick to decry Muslim states that impose religious laws on their people, it is time that we put our money where our mouths are, and let democracy trump theocracy in the nationwide game of whist.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-21T07:00:00Z", "title": "Time to take a gamble", "sentences": ["The recent controversy over the Sextival in Tel Aviv was one such incident where Israelis were forced to come to terms with their country&apos;s gradual shift towards laissez-faire ethics over the last couple of decades - and the event&apos;s success left a bitter taste in many disapproving mouths."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/21/timetotakeagamble"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The mayor of Sderot, an Israeli town repeatedly targeted by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, says in order to save Israeli lives he is ready to talk to Hamas - despite the international ban on contact with the militant Palestinian organisation. &quot;I would say to Hamas, let&apos;s have a ceasefire, let&apos;s stop the rockets for the next 10 years and we will see what happens,&quot; said Eli Moyal, the mayor, who is a member of the rightwing Likud party. &quot;For me as a person the most important thing is life and I&apos;m ready to do everything for that. I&apos;m ready to talk to the devil.&quot; Last week a child lost a leg in a rocket attack on Sderot. Moyal&apos;s first response was to call for the assassination of the Hamas leadership and for Gaza villages to be razed. But now he is ready for a different tactic. His call for talks comes as Israel&apos;s blockade on the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip is under international pressure. Senior UN officials agree in private that a political deal with Hamas will be necessary to end the rocket attacks on Sderot. Without a political solution or a ceasefire, &quot;it&apos;s quite hard to see how it&apos;s going to change in the future except that possibly it will get worse,&quot; one official said. Over the past two months an average of 50 rockets a week have landed in Sderot, more than double the weekly average in 2006 when 946 rockets hit the town. Since 2001, when Gazan militants first launched makeshift rockets at neighbouring towns in Israel, 12 people have died in such attacks. And there have been increasingly vocal calls for the Israeli military to reinvade Gaza in response. A poll last week showed a majority of Israelis want the military to respond even though many do not believe it will stop the attacks. The army withdrew from Gaza in 2005 when Israel evacuated its illegal settlements. Air strikes targeting militants continue. It has made several incursions. Israel has tried to isolate Hamas since the group won elections in 2006, and imposed a crippling economic blockade on Gaza in June 2007 after Hamas violently seized control of the strip and ousted Fatah, which is headed by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. But Israel has continued negotiating for the release of Gilad Shalit, a soldier captured in 2006, which requires Hamas&apos;s approval. Pressure is mounting in the EU for Israel to end its blockade. On Thursday the European parliament passed a resolution calling on Israel to stop &quot;collectively punishing&quot; Palestinians in Gaza - a &quot;policy of isolation&quot; that dfailed, it said. Moyal said Israel was at risk of losing the moral high ground if political pressure for a massive military operation grows. &quot;Maybe one day in the future we will lose our patience and our values and invade,&quot; he said. &quot;Imagine 20 kids [in Sderot] being killed in a kindergarten by a missile - then the Israel government would have to act and would lose its morality. If we don&apos;t talk we go deeper and deeper into war. If we don&apos;t talk we should fight.&quot;  He added that a major military escalation would be needed to stop the rockets and that would come at the price of &quot;innocent people being killed on both sides&quot;. The rise in rocket attacks has triggered two weeks of demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by Sderot&apos;s residents. Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said there were no &quot;simple quick fixes&quot; but that Hamas could stop the rockets tomorrow. &quot;Obviously from the point of view of the people of Sderot we are not doing enough,&quot; he said, adding that Israel would talk to Hamas if it met the UN demands of renouncing violence, recognising Israeli statehood and supporting peace. Moyal said he was approached by an Israeli intermediary to engage in talks with Hamas in Egypt but the meeting fell through owing to it being &quot;complicated&quot;. &quot;I believe that if they call me again I will be ready to do it. I will do the best I can to have that meeting,&quot; he added. Israel holds the Hamas leadership responsible for all rockets fired from Gaza, including those launched by other militant groups.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-23T00:06:00Z", "title": "Israeli mayor of bombarded border town offers to talk to Hamas", "sentences": ["The rise in rocket attacks has triggered two weeks of demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by Sderot&apos;s residents."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/23/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "Football", "Liverpool", "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"], "article": "Sorry, but there is nothing enigmatic about Liverpool in Europe. They bore opponents and spectators into submission as efficiently as they always did. It took them a while to adjust to back-passing and outright time-wasting being outlawed, but now they have the infinitely patient coach, tightly organised defence and genuine goal threat necessary to go a long way in the Champions League every year. This is not criticism. When Italians play in that manner we tend to admire them. Liverpool worked out how to do well in Europe before most British clubs and now they have cracked how to play the latter stages of the Champions League. We will pass over their struggles in the qualifying group for now, just as we will draw a veil over recent events in the FA Cup. Liverpool play Europe very well. End of story. The only reason people were expressing surprise at the 2-0 defeat of Internazionale, and searching for words such as enigmatic and inexplicable, was because they had only five minutes in which to transform Rafa Ben\u00edtez&apos;s funeral into his second coming. In a way the turnaround at Anfield the other night was almost as stunning as the miracle of Istanbul. At least you could see that coming, once Liverpool made their way back into the 2005 final. On Tuesday, everyone turned up to bury Ben\u00edtez and ended up praising him. People were scratching their heads and wondering why Dirk Kuyt was still on the field, if not actively calling him a donkey, when he popped up with the crucial goal. And just when Inter were beginning to think a single-goal deficit might not be too bad, Steven Gerrard taught them not to let their minds wander in the last minute. This was textbook European stuff, along with getting the opposing centre-half sent off and making the most of an unfortunate injury to Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba 15 minutes from the end. Because that is what Liverpool did, too. Marco Materazzi might have been a silly boy, but you are not telling me Fernando Torres didn&apos;t make the most of light contact on both occasions. And while Inter losing a second central defender was a stroke of luck for Liverpool, at least Ben\u00edtez had already sent on the substitutes to take advantage: Peter Crouch with his height under crosses, and Jermaine Pennant to run into the spaces on the flanks. Put it this way, had an English team lost 2-0 to Italians in the same circumstances, the coverage would have mentioned bad luck with injury and majored on the infuriating foreign habit of falling to the ground at the slightest touch. The Italian equivalent of Ben\u00edtez would have been in the dock for pathetically waggling two fingers to remind the referee of his duties, and the Italian equivalent of Jamie Carragher would have been mocked for turning from a hard man into a serial whinger. That&apos;s how good Liverpool are in Europe. Not only do they play like all those foreign teams we rarely beat, they have started to concentrate on the European Cup at the expense of their domestic league. They may not mean to, but they do. And should they reach the final and play Milan again, it is their turn to win. Which they might well do with Torres in the side. Had Torres been around last season, Liverpool would have had a much better chance in Athens. But perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves on the strength of a mere five minutes. Perhaps Liverpool won&apos;t look so clever should they be drawn against familiar opponents such as Arsenal or Manchester United. Perhaps now Ben\u00edtez&apos;s faith in Kuyt has been vindicated he will start rotating him. Perhaps Liverpool won&apos;t even survive the San Siro, as Fabio Capello has just warned, in which case they will have to be content with five minutes when they silenced the doubters and stuck it to their critics. It may not be enough to save Ben\u00edtez, and it may not fully compensate Liverpool supporters if another season ends up without reward, though for neutral viewers it made compelling drama. One could describe it as the best five minutes of the season, had that award not been parcelled up and delivered before Christmas. The most exciting five minutes of the season undoubtedly came at the end of the Israel v Russia game in Tel Aviv in November. In fact it was more like two minutes. In the 90th minute, with the scores level at 1-1, Russia were pressing and Dmitri Sychev struck a post. Massive relief in England. Had that shot gone in, England would have been eliminated from Euro 2008 and Steve McClaren would have been sacked. Instead the ball rebounded from the upright and was worked to the other end of the pitch, where hugely against the run of play substitute striker Omer Golan flicked the ball nonchalantly over the Russian goalkeeper to seal an Israel win. England were alive again. All they had to do was hold Croatia at home and, well, you know the rest. Two of football&apos;s most endearing qualities are that it is incredibly difficult to predict eventual outcomes and that otherwise ordinary games can be transformed by just a few minutes of magic or mayhem. It is not a formula that needs changing. So let&apos;s have no more silly talk of exhibition matches, please. Wandering the world with a begging bowl would be slightly less degrading. Arsenal must show the flair to prove home draw has lost its sting So, in a two-legged European tie where away goals count double, if the scores are level, is a goalless draw at home in the first leg a good result or a bad one? Arsenal will find out at the San Siro next month, of course, but should they travel to Italy kicking themselves for not scoring at home or congratulating themselves on not allowing Milan the advantage of an away goal? This question is almost as old as European football itself, although with the shift towards attacking football promoted by the rule changes of 16 years ago, there has been a subtle change in thinking. In the old days any sort of draw away from home in the first leg was definitely a good result and teams held at home would travel for the second leg knowing their chances of progressing were reduced. Now, as long as you are set up to score goals, going into the away leg all square can be viewed as a slight advantage. If you score one, your opponents must score two, and so on. To demonstrate this has not always been the case, let me give you an example. In 2000, when they were defending European champions, Manchester United drew 0-0 in the first leg of a quarter-final against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u, and Sir Alex Ferguson was chuffed to bits. Still looking at it the old way, the United manager figured that having held Real on their own patch the job was more than half done. It was only when Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez, Fernando Redondo and Steve McManaman passed United to pieces to take a 3-0 lead at Old Trafford that Ferguson began to wish he had an away goal or two in the bank. Ra\u00fal&apos;s second goal left United needing to score four in 38 minutes. In the event they managed two and went out, leaving everyone marvelling at Real&apos;s sheer attacking boldness. As they did again three years later when Real, through a memorable Ronaldo hat-trick, repeated their trick of scoring three away goals in the first hour to kill United&apos;s slim chances (after losing 3-1 in Spain) of getting back into the tie. This time United managed four in reply, but it still wasn&apos;t enough. Ferguson now regards 0-0 away from home in the first leg as an unsatisfactory result. Presumably, so will Carlo Ancelotti. That must mean Arsenal, as the home side, are entitled to see it as a good result. As long as they believe in their ability to score. The key is the attacking punch you can deliver in the second leg. If Arsenal are the creative force everyone keeps saying they are, now is the time to show it. It&apos;s not always plain who to blame for the pain in Spain A fortnight ago Manchester City fans were kept behind for half an hour at Old Trafford for their own safety, only to find an absence of police protection when they were targeted by bottle throwers on emerging into the street. Spanish police have just gone one better than that, giving Bolton fans a whacking during the game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and still keeping them inside the Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium for a full hour afterwards. Bolton chairman Phil Gartside has made an official complaint about &apos;overzealous and disproportionate&apos; treatment of supporters by police, and Spain is once again being arraigned as a country incapable of modern standards of security. It&apos;s a good story, after the Lewis Hamilton unpleasantness acted as a reminder that Spain also has previous with racism in sport, though unfortunately Bolton may not prove whiter than white. &apos;The police were overzealous, there&apos;s no doubt about that,&apos; a Wanderers fan present at the game said. &apos;But they were not unprovoked. The baton charges only started when missiles began to be thrown, and I&apos;ve got to say the missiles were going from us to the Madrid fans. I didn&apos;t see any come our way. There was also horrendous drunkenness. Some people had clearly been boozing for a very long time. It was like being back in the 1970s actually, quite scary. The stewarding, the policing and the signage could all have been much better, but Bolton can&apos;t get on a high horse about it. We need to put our own house in order first.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-02-24T00:14:43Z", "title": "Rafa's resurrection worth the wait", "sentences": ["The most exciting five minutes of the season undoubtedly came at the end of the Israel v Russia game in Tel Aviv in November."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/feb/23/rafasresurrectionworththew"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Returning from a panel discussion on the question &quot;Is the media biased?&quot; at Tel Aviv University recently, I logged on to Cif to check out the debate on several threads about Israel. Unsurprisingly, all four of them had made it into the &quot;most active&quot; list - and sadly, three of them had been closed for comments because the debates had become too aggressive: Mick Dumper&apos;s piece, Gloom over Jerusalem, Ben White&apos;s What lies beneath, and Seth Freedman&apos;s Life under military rule. The one that was still open for comments, Andre Oboler&apos;s False prospectus on campus previously had been closed for the first night after its publication. For a website with the name &quot;Comment is free&quot;, this is undoubtedly a sad state of affairs. At the same time, it is also a telling reflection of the subject of the debates: it seems that when it comes to Israel and the Middle East conflict, Cif just imitates life - whether it is in Cif&apos;s cyber world or the real Middle East, the extremists get a veto over what the majority can do. Just like the extremists in real life have too often succeeded in sabotaging talks and peace efforts, in Cif&apos;s cyber world the extremists succeed in closing down debates. But perhaps, at least in Cif&apos;s cyber world, something good can come out of this dismal experience, because it also offers an opportunity to reflect on some crucial issues and questions. At the most basic level, one would obviously have to ask what it is that so often derails debates about anything to do with Israel. The long answer would require a book (I&apos;m working on it, but progress is slow because I spend too much time on Cif ... ), though, at least to my mind, The Economist once managed to explain rather concisely &quot;Why Europe, unlike America, finds it so hard to love Israel&quot;. Written just after the end of the Lebanon war in August 2006, The Economist concluded its piece with an observation by Emanuele Ottolenghi, who argued that &quot;Europeans see Israel as the embodiment of the demons of their own past.&quot; If it is at all possible to give a short answer to the question why debates about Israel tend to become so contentious, I would also suggest that it has a lot to do with the fact that for the political left it has become acceptable to regard Israel as a &quot;country in question&quot;. The Guardian certainly has done its share by giving a platform to people who claim that &quot;Israel simply has no right to exist&quot; - but then, you can also open Ha&apos;aretz and find an article entitled &quot;Israel should pack up and go&quot;. To be sure, if &quot;comment is free&quot;, no subject should be taboo - but it is certainly notable that no other country has its right to exist questioned or made conditional on good behaviour. Moreover, as everyone can check at the bottom of Cif&apos;s website, the famous CP Scott quote reads in its entirety &quot;Comment is free, but facts are sacred&quot;, and one fact that is often overlooked, or even outright denied, is that it is not just in Cif&apos;s cyber world that Israel&apos;s right to exist is questioned, but also in the real world of the Middle East. To give just one of the most recent examples, Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Imad Mughniyah, declaring that &quot;his blood will lead to the elimination of Israel&quot;. Of course Hizbullah by itself is hardly in a position to deliver on this threat, but it is perhaps worthwhile to note in this context that in the panel discussion I mentioned in the beginning, the European participants said that they had been unaware how deeply felt the sense of insecurity in Israel still is. It may seem reasonable to argue that both in the cyber world and in the real world, the extremists should be dismissed as representing just an ultimately irrelevant minority. But both in the cyber world and in the real world, extremists do have real power: on Cif they can kill debates, and in the real world, they can kill real people. One of the major issues that contributes greatly to the polarisation of debates about Israel is the question whether Israel does indeed face threats that might justify or at least explain some of its controversial policies, or whether these threats are actually a result of Israel&apos;s policies. Reasonable people can disagree on the answers to those questions, but reasonable people should also be able to debate about them, abiding by CP Scott&apos;s motto that the &quot;voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard&quot; - and maybe even heeding his observation that comment &quot;also is justly subject to a self-imposed restraint. It is well to be frank; it is even better to be fair.&quot; It is arguably a reflection of the alarming lack of self-imposed restraint, let alone fairness, that characterises debates about Israel not only on Cif, but also elsewhere, that the American Jewish Committee recently launched the online journal &quot;Z Word&quot; to counter the &quot;increasingly toxic&quot; public discourse about anything to do with Israel. When CP Scott wrote back in 1921, an online forum like Cif was utterly unimaginable, but his notion that comment should be &quot;subject to a self-imposed restraint&quot; remains remarkably relevant, because self-imposed restraint would seem much better than the restraint imposed by frustrated and exhausted moderators, not least because the decision to close a debate hands a victory to the extremists.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-25T10:30:00Z", "title": "The extremists' veto", "sentences": ["Returning from a panel discussion on the question &quot;Is the media biased?&quot; at Tel Aviv University recently, I logged on to Cif to check out the debate on several threads about Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/25/theextremistsveto"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Facts might have been sacred to CP Scott, but when it comes to the two bitterly divided camps in the Israel-Palestine conflict, very little weight is attached to hard evidence. At least, nowhere near as much as is paid to the way in which truth is interpreted and twisted to suit the political agenda of whoever&apos;s holding the conch shell. So it was this week, in the wake of the minor earthquakes that struck the region and prompted some ludicrous theories for their cause from both the Israeli and Palestinian camps. One girl I know who works in the West Bank told me that teachers had been quick to tell their pupils that the tremors were caused by the Zionist regime, who&apos;d detonated bombs under the earth purely to disrupt Palestinians&apos; lives and remind them who was boss. At the same time, an ultra-orthodox Jewish MK told a Knesset committee with an entirely straight face that the earthquakes were divine punishment for parliament&apos;s tolerance of homosexuality. Both stories are based on equally preposterous premises, but that means little to the acolytes of the teachers or politicians involved, who lap up their words and incorporate what they are taught into their own world view. And so to today, when I witnessed a similar two-way pull take place during an archaeological tour of Silwan in east Jerusalem. I attended the trip as a follow up to my recent piece about the controversial excavations being carried out by settlers in the heart of the Arab village. In the two weeks since I met the protesters, several had been arrested on trumped up charges of violence against the settlers, before being released without charge - but having been made fully aware that their objections to the digging were not going to be tolerated. &quot;The collusion of the police, the army and the settlers is more pronounced in Silwan than anywhere else in the country&quot;, one demonstrator told me today. &quot;The policemen tell the settlers &apos;kol hakavod&apos; [all our respect] for buying up Arab homes, and they do nothing when we present evidence of the settlers attacking us&quot;. The protest tent in the centre of town is still going strong, well-attended by both local Arab residents and sympathetic Israelis who come to show their support for the cause. Against this backdrop, it seemed apposite to go on a self-styled &quot;alternative tour&quot; of Silwan&apos;s ancient sites, run by a Tel Aviv university professor of archaeology who made no bones about where his sympathies lay in the dispute. He spent two hours walking our 30-strong group around the town, castigating the work of Elad - the settler organisation who, he claims, &quot;have a stranglehold over the entire area&quot;. Elad have been handed responsibility for excavations in the area, and use their position to prevent Arab construction, claiming that all open space is off limits to anyone but archaeologists. Of course, when it suits Elad, they overrule their own regulations and build new settler houses, as we witnessed on our walk through Silwan. However, the worst part about Elad&apos;s vice-like grip over Silwan&apos;s antiquities is that it is their narrative alone that is told to most of the half a million tourists who visit the area every year. &quot;They train all the guides in how to present the facts&quot;, said Professor Greenberg, &quot;who in turn pass on this version of events to the thousands of people who go on their trips&quot;. The IDF send all their soldiers on Elad tours, he said, where they are fed the line that Silwan has always had a Jewish presence, and by doing so Elad justify their reasons for &quot;Judaising&quot; the area in the present day. They make no bones about their intention to flood the village with Jews with scant regard for the Arab populace since, in the eyes of Elad, Silwan is the rightful inheritance of the Jewish descendants of their Biblical ancestors. Midway through the tour, I noticed one participant scowling at the guide and seemingly having a hard time keeping his thoughts to himself, and as I watched him I had a faint recollection of having met him before. As we wandered off down the road to the next site, I pulled him to one side and asked if something was wrong, to which he replied &quot;this is a far left, extremist tour - just listen to his language, and how all he cares about is the Palestinians&quot;. Casting a furtive look to check that none of the other participants were listening, he whispered to me that &quot;I&apos;m here undercover - I actually run my own tours of east Jerusalem, but they&apos;re very different to this one&quot;. The penny dropped immediately - I was face to face with Reuven, whom I had met when I was playing my own game of espionage last year by donning religious dress and joining the JCDF tour that he&apos;d led. However, he clearly had no idea who I was, and decided to unload his burden on me and tell me just where the professor was leading us astray with his &quot;suicidal&quot; language. &quot;There were never Palestinians living here before &apos;67&quot;, he told me firmly. &quot;In fact, there were no such people as Palestinians before &apos;67&quot;. He told me that he&apos;d sneaked onto this tour to check out his opposition for himself, and that he hoped I wouldn&apos;t give him away to our guide. I asked him if he ever worried that left wingers played the same trick on him, but he just shook his head and laughed, telling me &quot;I&apos;d spot them in an instant if they did&quot;. He said that his main interest was &quot;raising enough funds to move Jews back into these areas&quot;, and that the Palestinians &quot;should just learn to live alongside us&quot;. He didn&apos;t care about trying to educate the left to see his point, he said, &quot;since all we need is money - and there are enough right-wing supporters to provide that&quot;. In his eyes, settlers had as much right to move into Palestinian areas &quot;as blacks did when they moved into white areas in the 1970s&quot;, painting a ridiculously skewed picture of the settlers having to struggle for their rights in the wake of Palestinian oppression. In the case of Silwan, he told me, &quot;the Palestinians came to live here after &apos;67 - but even now they refuse to recognise the country they&apos;ve chosen to live in. It&apos;s like me putting up a tent in your front yard, then refusing to recognise that it&apos;s your front yard at all&quot;. Despite having heard it all from him before, it was shocking to hear the way he so adamantly insisted that the settlers were the injured party in all this. Whilst the likes of Reuven and Elad still insist that black is white, and whilst they are still able to skew the facts so brazenly in order to keep their coffers full, all the peaceful protests in the world won&apos;t make any difference on ground level. The settlement juggernaut will continue to thunder through the heart of Silwan and other Arab villages, as the noise of its engine drowns out any voices of reason that try to speak up against the injustice.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-26T07:00:00Z", "title": "Digging into trouble", "sentences": ["Against this backdrop, it seemed apposite to go on a self-styled &quot;alternative tour&quot; of Silwan&apos;s ancient sites, run by a Tel Aviv university professor of archaeology who made no bones about where his sympathies lay in the dispute."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/diggingintotrouble"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Moshe Katsav"], "article": "Israel&apos;s former president, Moshe Katsav, has escaped rape charges and a possible prison term after the country&apos;s supreme court today upheld a controversial plea bargain. Katsav left office in disgrace in June after four former female employees accused him of rape and other sex crimes. He insisted he was the victim of a witch hunt. Under the plea bargain, he avoids the most serious charges but pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence on two charges of sexual harassment. A panel of five judges ruled the deal was reasonable, rejecting claims Katsav had received lenience because of his prominent position. Israel&apos;s attorney general, Meni Mazuz, who originally said he would charge Katsav on all counts, suggested the state was uncertain it could convict him on the rape charges. The dropped charges carried a sentence of up to 20 years. Women&apos;s rights groups, bolstered by a public outcry, petitioned the supreme court to overturn the agreement shortly after it was announced eight months ago. &quot;This is a sad day,&quot; said Yifat Matzner, a lawyer for one of the groups. Kinneret Barashi, a lawyer for one of the women who accused Katsav of rape, said she was &quot;very much infuriated&quot; by the court&apos;s decision today. &quot;If the attorney general&apos;s decision was wrong, deficient, riddled with shortcomings, distorts reality, causes many people emotional upheaval and leaves a woman&apos;s body defenceless, then I think it would have been proper to intervene in such a vile plea bargain,&quot; she said. Katzav&apos;s lawyers welcome the ruling. &quot;President Katzav was accused of the most serious crimes: two rapes here, another rape there, and was presented... as a serial sexual offender,&quot; his lawyer, Avigdor Feldman, told reporters, calling the final charges &quot;a tiny, shrivelled-up indictment&quot;. &quot;Someone owes the president a deep apology,&quot; Feldman said. In announcing the plea bargain, Mazuz said one of his considerations was the reputation of the Israeli presidency and his desire to avoid a prolonged trial with embarrassing headlines. Opponents of the deal had hoped the supreme court would take the rare step of declaring the plea bargain unacceptable and either overturn it or send it back to Mazuz for revision. Katsav&apos;s accusers say he repeatedly fondled them, kissed them, exposed himself and in two cases raped them while he was president, and earlier as tourism minister. Israel&apos;s presidency is a largely ceremonial position, but the allegations shocked the country by portraying the man trusted as Israel&apos;s moral compass as a predatory boss who forced himself on female employees. Katsav stood down after the charges emerged in July 2006, but refused to resign until the plea bargain forced him to do so. Israeli elder statesman and Nobel prize for peace laureate Shimon Peres replaced him as Israel&apos;s ceremonial leader in July. In an interview after standing down, an unrepentant Katsav said he had gone through &quot;a full year of incitement, persecution, when we were not allowed a calm moment, and constant efforts to prove my innocence&quot;.

His tenure as Israel&apos;s chief of staff (1987-91) included the first Palestinian intifada and the successful launch of Iraqi Scud missiles into Israel. Shomron was in charge of Israel&apos;s paratroopers and infantry when news broke on June 27 1976 that four hijackers from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the German Revolutionary Cells had captured an Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris. The plane was diverted to Entebbe in Uganda, where it was held pending terrorist demands for the release of 53 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli and various European jails. The separation of Jewish passengers from among the hostages particularly alarmed the authorities in Jerusalem. Shomron&apos;s plan, initially codenamed Operation Thunderball but since renamed Operation Yonatan in memory of Yonatan Netanyahu, the only Israeli officer to die in the mission, was to fly four Lockheed Hercules C-130s from Israel to Entebbe, and then, under cover of darkness, to engage Ugandan guards in diversionary attacks while elite commandos rescued the captives. Shomron himself flew the first plane to land.  The operation was completed within an hour and the planes returned to a jubilant Israel. Only one hostage died, as did all hijackers and several Ugandan soldiers. Shomron later revealed that a Mossad agent posing as a private pilot had staged a crash-landing near Entebbe to send back vital information on the layout of the airport.  Charles Bronson played Shomron in the 1977 Hollywood film, Raid on Entebbe. However, Shomron himself was never comfortable with such adulation. Bluff and old-school in nature, soft-toned and blue-eyed, he held his emotions in check. His time as chief of staff was highly controversial. At first he relished the opportunity to propel the army into the hi-tech age. But within six months he found himself presiding over attempts to crush the intifada. The left chided him for allowing excessive brutality, the right for being pusillanimous in his bid to stifle unrest. He was criticised for allowing actions like clubbing demonstrators and demolishing homes of families whose children were arrested. Significantly, he issued his generals with copies of Alistair Horne&apos;s book Savage War of Peace, which described the FLN struggle against French rule in Algeria, and concluded that it was impossible to defeat a guerrilla movement through force alone. In Shomron&apos;s last year in office he implored prime minister Yitzhak Shamir to be allowed to retaliate for the Iraqi Scud missiles being fired on Israel. But Shamir chose restraint after US President George Bush Sr assured him that America would destroy the Scud launchers with its Patriot missiles. Two years later Shomron dismissed the supposed US success as &quot;a joke&quot;. Born on Kibbutz Ashdot Ya&apos;akov, near the Sea of Galilee in what was still British Mandate Palestine, Shormon joined the paratroops in 1955; his unit commander was the young Ariel Sharon. The following year he fought in the Sinai campaign, the Israeli element of the joint British, French and Israeli Suez invasion. Years later, according to his military r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he was the first Israeli paratrooper to reach the canal during the 1967 six-day war. By 1974 he had reached the rank of brigadier general. As head of the army&apos;s southern command (1979-83), he oversaw the withdrawal of troops from the Sinai peninsula following the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. After leaving the military in 1991, Shomron became chairman of the state-owned arms manufacturer Israel Military Industries. Two years ago, he emerged from retirement to chair an internal military inquiry into Israel&apos;s inconclusive Lebanon war.

But there was one country in the Middle East that didn&apos;t get off to a flier. In fact, Israel won&apos;t begin their campaign until September. For the tenth consecutive major international tournament, Israel will compete under the Uefa umbrella to reach the World Cup finals. The weird international anomaly no longer feels that unusual. England fans didn&apos;t bat an eyelid when they travelled to Tel Aviv for a Euro 2008 qualifier last year and Israel&apos;s best players can be seen regularly in the Premier League and La Liga. But the time may be right for Israel to rejoin its rightful home in the Asian Football Confederation. Why? This may sound grandiose but a shift in membership could see football at least kick-start a process that sees Israel and the Arab states that surround it normalise relations. Talk of peace through football is usually reserved for sickly sweet Fifa press releases, complete with Ronaldo in a black and white keffiyeh and Beckham kissing a Palestinian child, that have you reaching for a sick bucket. But bear with me. You see, thanks to two often ignored tennis tournaments in the Persian Gulf later this month, the time is right for sport to give Israel exactly what it craves most: recognition, albeit tacitly, from the countries it feels are working to destroy it. Until 1972, Israel was a fully paid-up member of the AFC, qualifying for the 1970 World Cup. They won the 1964 Asian Cup and came third when the competition was next held in Iran, losing to the hosts 2-1. It might sound weird now but Iran also beat Israel in Tehran at the 1974 Asian Games. But the same tournament embodied Israel&apos;s problem. Kuwait - and every other Arab state - refused to play Israel and the AFC cast the Jewish state into the wilderness. The Israel national team lived a nomadic existence, attempting to qualify for tournaments via various other associations, including Oceania, before Uefa found them a home in 1994. But three crucial things have changed since then. Firstly, Israel has gallantly failed, but failed none the less, to qualify for a single major championship since joining the European footballing family. The second is the political power that football yields in Middle Eastern countries. The third, and most important of all, is that the time is right. Last month it emerged that Israeli tennis players Shahar Peer, Tzipi Obziler, Andy Ram and Yoni Erlich will appear at two ATP and WTA tournaments in Doha, the capital of Qatar and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, starting next week. Both governments have long-standing bans on Israeli passport holders entering their countries, although in practice some quiet trade has been going on for years. Qatar has a particular vested interest in relaxing its stance towards Israel. After hosting the 2006 Asian Games, they hope to bid for the World Cup and the Olympics. A ban on Israeli athletes would put paid to that. Oman (who had a trade treaty with Israel between 1996 and 2000) and Bahrain (whose government moved to end an embargo on Israeli goods in 2005) have made encouraging noises while Saudi Arabia has more in common with Israeli foreign policy aims than it likes to admit - in particular, a fear of Iranian regional hegemony. All have similar objectives, to slowly normalise relations with Israel without antagonising their anti-Israel constituencies. Normalisation with Israel, after all, brings benefits, including US and EU free trade agreements and an easier ride to WTO membership. The invite to the Israeli tennis players is a political move designed to dip a toe in the water and see what bites. But back to the football. With Qatar and the UAE grasping the nettle, it&apos;s now possible to consider an Israeli national team playing on Muslim soil in a competitive match for the first time in three decades. It&apos;s great news for Israel. For one, they will have a far better chance of qualifying for the World Cup: only Saudi Arabia, Australia, Iraq and maybe Japan are anywhere near their level. But even more importantly, it will be a tacit recognition that would bypass intransigent Middle Eastern governments by appealing directly to the fans. Football is so important in Middle Eastern countries that governments dare not mess with it, especially when World Cup qualification is in question. Yemen and Kuwait have both been forced to amend their ways after Fifa suspended their membership for political interference. And which is the only international body to publicly force Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to back down? The UN? The EU? No, Fifa, when it suspended the Iranian FA after the president was caught drafting his own man into the top position. Imagine if Israel was drawn against Iran in a World Cup qualifier. Any government intervention would see the country lose three points and face further censure from Fifa. There would be riots on the streets as there were when Iran qualified for the World Cup in 1998 (which emboldened the reformist movement) and then in 2001 (when angry fans blamed the government for throwing a vital qualifier so that the same World Cup fever would not be repeated). An outright no-show would be unthinkable and the only choice would be to play - by doing so, Israel is recognised by the back door. For the first time many Middle Eastern football fans will see another narrative surrounding Israel. Rather than alien aggressors, TV audiences will see footballers and fans who don&apos;t look much different to them. It would break an important barrier. Age-old political differences matter, but for the average fan on the street, World Cup qualification matters more. The big issue is safeguarding the protection of the players. But this can be dealt with. For the tennis tournaments in the Gulf, both the UAE and Qatar have guaranteed that security won&apos;t be an issue for the players. Any incident would be hugely damaging for both countries. In the football world you have to deal with a different phenomenon: the away match. Trips to Riyadh, Tehran, Beirut and Damascus may pose problems, but there is a precedent here. Iraq and Palestine play all of their games away from home due to the security situation in their homeland. Why can&apos;t Israel play the most sensitive matches in Amman, Jordan? The Jordanian capital is a mere few hours from Jerusalem, through the West Bank and over the Allenby Bridge, and Israeli citizens are allowed in. Plus, if the Jordanian authorities can guarantee the security of Amman&apos;s Israeli embassy, why not its national football stadium? The 2010 World Cup has come too soon for Fifa to spark an outbreak of world peace. But the 2014 tournament could well see Israeli football coming home.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-27T14:42:29Z", "title": "Football: Time for Israel to return to Asian Football Confederation", "sentences": ["England fans didn&apos;t bat an eyelid when they travelled to Tel Aviv for a Euro 2008 qualifier last year and Israel&apos;s best players can be seen regularly in the Premier League and La Liga."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/worldcup2010"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Israel is under growing pressure to talk to the Islamist Palestinian group Hamas, which fired a barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel yesterday, killing a student. The strike followed the publication of a poll showing 64% of Israelis want their government to negotiate with Hamas to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was captured in 2006.  A Tel Aviv University professor, Camil Fuchs, who supervised the survey for Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper, said the results showed that Israeli&apos;s were fed up with the conflict. &quot;They&apos;re tired, they want a normal life,&quot; Fuchs said. For the past two months, Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired about 50 rockets a week but Hamas sharply escalated its attack yesterday, launching 26 rockets at the southern Israeli town of Sderot in less than two hours, according to the Israel Defence Force news desk. Hamas fired the salvo after Israel&apos;s air force killed five of the group&apos;s rocket launchers, including two key operators, and wounded several others.  &quot;It shows the bloody mindedness of the occupation,&quot; Hamas spokesman Taher Nunu told the Associated Press. Israel kills militants from various Palestinian fighter groups in the Gaza Strip almost daily. The Palestinian rockets are notoriously inaccurate but yesterday they struck a 30-year-old Israeli student sitting in his car on the outskirts of Sderot. Another student was wounded as was a 10-year-old boy on Tuesday. An elderly Palestinian man was killed in northern Gaza when the Israelis returned fire, a Palestinian source said. Israel&apos;s government resisted intense pressure from its citizens to reinvade Gaza in response to the rocket attacks. Instead it has tried to isolate Hamas with a crippling economic blockade on Gaza and almost daily air attacks and raids.  The Israeli government refuses to talk directly to Hamas because the militant group will not recognise its right to exist or the previous peace agreements which have been signed by more moderate Palestinian leaders.  However, it has been talking indirectly to Hamas via Egypt, to free Shalit and possibly about bringing about a lull in the attacks. But now it is under pressure to talk directly with Hamas, which has also refused direct talks, on these issues.  The head of Israel&apos;s Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre, Reuven Ehrlich said the poll reflected a pragmatic streak in the Israeli public. &quot;I don&apos;t think the public poll refers to a change in policy,&quot; Ehrlich said.  However, an analyst with Israel&apos;s Institute for Counter Terrorism and retired brigadier general, Shalom Harari, said Israel&apos;s strategy was working. &quot;The biggest pressure on Hamas is how to deal with the [Israel army] killing its activists.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-02-28T00:12:00Z", "title": "Talk to Hamas, Israelis tell government as attacks continue", "sentences": ["A Tel Aviv University professor, Camil Fuchs, who supervised the survey for Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper, said the results showed that Israeli&apos;s were fed up with the conflict."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/28/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "An Israeli minister today warned of increasingly bitter conflict in the Gaza Strip, saying the Palestinians could bring on themselves what he called a &quot;holocaust&quot;. &quot;The more Qassam [rocket] fire intensifies and the rockets reach a longer range, they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we will use all our might to defend ourselves,&quot; Matan Vilnai, Israel&apos;s deputy defence minister, told army radio. Shoah is the Hebrew word normally reserved to refer to the Jewish Holocaust. It is rarely used in Israel outside discussions of the Nazi extermination of Jews during the second world war, and many Israelis are loath to countenance its use to describe other events. The minister&apos;s statement came after two days of tit-for-tat missile raids between Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli army. At least 32 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed since the surge in violence on Wednesday. Today Israel activated a rocket warning system to protect Ashkelon, a city of 120,000 people, from Palestinian attacks. Ashkelon was hit by several Grad rockets fired from Gaza yesterday. One hit an apartment building, slicing through the roof and three floors below, and another landed near a school, wounding a 17-year-old girl. Located 11 miles from Gaza, Ashkelon has been sporadically targeted before but not suffered direct hits or significant damage. &quot;It will be sad, and difficult, but we have no other choice,&quot; Vilnai said, referring to the large-scale military operation he said Israel was preparing to bring a halt to the rocket fire. &quot;We&apos;re getting close to using our full strength. Until now, we&apos;ve used a small percentage of the army&apos;s power because of the nature of the territory.&quot; Israel would not launch a ground offensive in the next week or two, partly because the military would prefer to wait for better weather, defence sources said. But the army had completed its preparations and was awaiting the government&apos;s order to move, officials said. Until now, the Palestinian rocket squads have largely targeted Sderot, a small town near Gaza. Ashkelon, a big population centre only 25 miles from Tel Aviv, was caught unprepared, its mayor said on Friday. &quot;It&apos;s a city of 120,000 people, with large facilities \u2013 a huge soccer stadium, a basketball stadium and a beach. No one is ready for this,&quot; Roni Mehatzri told Israel Radio. Dozens of soldiers in orange berets from the Israeli military&apos;s home front command arrived in Ashkelon and hung posters around the city telling residents what to do in case of rocket attack. The barrage of Iranian-made Grads directed at Ashkelon yesterday came after an escalation of violence in Gaza. Israel killed five Hamas militants on Wednesday morning, apparently including two planners of the rocket attacks, in an air strike on a minivan. Later in the day, a Palestinian rocket killed an Israeli civilian, a 47-year-old father of four, in Sderot. Hamas, an Islamist group with close ties to Iran, has ruled Gaza since its violent takeover there in June 2006. Since Wednesday, 32 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli missile strikes, including 14 civilians, among them eight children, according to Palestinian officials. The youngest was a six-month-old boy, Mohammed al-Borai, whose funeral was held yesterday. There were further indications that Israel was preparing for an offensive by sending confidential messages to world leaders, including the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who plans to visit the region next week. &quot;Israel is not keen on, and rushing for, an offensive, but Hamas is leaving us no choice,&quot; the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, told the senior figures, according to Israel&apos;s mass circulation daily, Yedioth Ahronoth.

His distant father seems convinced that Lewis could have prevented the accident and withdraws from him still further and only a few months after her death returns with Alice, a demanding second wife. From the safety of a loving childhood, Lewis is cast out into an emotional vacuum by his mother&apos;s death and the consequences of this deprivation form the centre of Sadie Jones&apos;s accomplished debut, The Outcast (Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a312.99, pp345) When the novel opens, it is 1957 and he is 19, returning to his father&apos;s house in Waterford after two years in Brixton jail. Although &apos;his father had sent him enough money not to come home&apos;, on his release he goes back none the less, to face the disapproval of his family and the judgment of a community that is anything but forgiving. Jones depicts the stifling Fifties with a terrifying clarity and menace, its cocktail parties and lunches, its social pressures, its family secrets simmering beneath a show of church-going piety. There is nothing here to envy; everyone seems trapped and disconnected and superficial. Only hurting, broken Lewis is sympathetic, and tough little Kit Carmichael, who observes his troubles and has always loved him from afar. This is an impressive new voice and the blossoming friendship between Lewis and the feisty Kit gives hope where none seems possible. Homesick by Eshkol Nevo (Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a312.99, pp374) portrays life in a very different community, one that at least supports even as it suffocates. Noa is a photography student in Jerusalem, Amir is studying psychology in Tel Aviv and they compromise by moving in together in a village between the two, a tiny community of families up in the hills. The narrative moves between Noa and Amir as well as a number of other characters from the neighbourhood - the little boy next door whose brother was just killed serving in Lebanon; their landlady Sima, the same age as Noa yet raising two children and running a home; Saddiq, an Arab construction worker who realises that Sima&apos;s house used to belong to his family before 1948. Nevo writes with sensitivity, honesty and humour that make the book compelling. This is a tender, beautiful tale about loneliness and connections, about love and compromise, about community, shared trauma and interwoven histories. He describes with seeming simplicity the essence of what it is to be an Israeli - the warmth, the fear and the confusing exhaustion of daily life in conflict. But more than that, it is a gentle study of what it is to be human - passion, anger, longing and all the many shades between them, as his characters struggle to find their way. From Israel to Saudi Arabia, where a very different story unfolds - a murder mystery in which the hero is a religious Palestinian desert tracker whose female sidekick must cover her face with a burka before he&apos;ll address her directly. Zo\u00eb Ferraris lived for a time in a religious community in Saudi Arabia and has drawn on her experience in The Night of the Mi&apos;raj (Little, Brown \u00a314.99, pp356), the story of a pious Bedouin family who hire desert guide Nayir to find their runaway daughter. When she&apos;s found dead near the family&apos;s camp ground, Nayir suspects foul play and, although he resents having to work in proximity to a woman, he is forced to collaborate with Katya Hijazi, the forensic scientist on the case. The whodunnit is somewhat predictable, but the location makes it interesting and, as a portrait of contemporary life in Jeddah, it&apos;s a success. Ferraris presents the repression of women but without ramming it down the reader&apos;s throat. It&apos;s enough to note, in passing, that Nayir and Katya could be arrested for talking to each other alone. It&apos;s all a far cry from Las Vegas, where sins take rather different forms, many of which are explored in Charles Bock&apos;s Beautiful Children (John Murray \u00a314.99, pp407). Bock has created a catalogue of retired go-go dancers, comic-book artists, casino managers, strippers, wasters and strays and their roles in the unfurling events of the night that 12-year-old Newell Ewing disappears. Bock&apos;s debut shows potential but, like Las Vegas itself, it&apos;s just too much in the end - it needed restraint or the firm hand of an editor.

Both options carry high political and strategic risks, and the outcome will set the course of Israeli-Palestinian relations for the foreseeable future. In the eyes of most Israelis, the seeds of the fighting were sown by the Israeli pullout of Gaza in August 2005. It was morally and strategically right. But Israel failed to disengage itself from Gaza. Palestinian terrorist groups kept firing rockets into Israel, and Israel remained responsible for Gaza&apos;s wellbeing.  The rocket barrage turned life on this side of the Green Line into a nightmare. Then the second Lebanon war of summer 2006 put the north of Israel under rocket fire from Hizbullah. Many Israelis felt that their country was shrinking, and only the area around Tel Aviv remained relatively safe from rockets. This has far-reaching implications for any peace process. Israel evacuated south Lebanon and Gaza, and both were turned into launching pads for rockets. A West Bank withdrawal could put all of Israel&apos;s populated areas within rocket range. It would make life in Israel unbearable. So, as long as there is no credible response to the rockets - either through a reliable security force to prevent their launch, or technology to intercept them in the air - any territorial change appears unreasonable. As the rockets kept flowing and Hamas kept arming, pressure was mounting on the Israeli government to invade. But Ehud Olmert, the prime minister, and Ehud Barak, his defence minister, have been reluctant. Time for hesitation is running out, however, as more and more Israelis are falling within hitting range. Olmert has to choose. He can try to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas. In a recent Ha&apos;aretz poll, 64% of Israelis supported talks with Hamas on a ceasefire and prisoner exchange. The arguments for talking to Hamas are compelling: a quiet period may lead the organisation to moderate and politicise itself; Hamas has proved more disciplined than Fatah in respecting ceasefires; and Hamas doesn&apos;t ask Israel for a final peace deal - it suffices with a long-term truce - which is safer politically for Olmert. But the government is reluctant to reverse its course, forgo its efforts to isolate and bring down Hamas, and admit its strategic failure and weakness. Olmert fears that by recognising Hamas, Israel will be practically dismissing the president, Mahmoud Abbas, and what remains of the Palestinian moderate camp. Instead, Israel will have to deal with a rejectionist regime that refuses to recognise the country&apos;s legitimacy.  The other option, invade and occupy Gaza, is even riskier. It would entail many casualties among Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians, and Israel lacks an exit strategy. Nobody is eager to take responsibility for Gaza, and the prospect of controlling the lives of 1.5 million Palestinians is a nightmare for Israelis.  So Olmert is trying desperately to buy more time with limited military operations, while pledging to keep peace negotiations going with Abbas. Olmert&apos;s pledges to end the rocket fire ring hollow. The Israeli media and the public are challenging him to order &quot;the large ground operation&quot;. Cabinet ministers suggest bombing the site of rocket attacks even if they are in civilian neighbourhoods. Olmert has to choose between the bad and the worse. In the Arab-Israeli context, wars happen when governments and organisations feel they must deliver on unfulfilled pledges. That is why further escalation appears inevitable - with far-reaching implications for the Middle East&apos;s future. \u00b7 Aluf Benn is the diplomatic editor of the Israeli newspaper Ha&apos;aretz aluf@haaretz.co.il", "publicationDate": "2008-03-04T00:06:48Z", "title": "Aluf Benn: The bad or the worse", "sentences": ["Many Israelis felt that their country was shrinking, and only the area around Tel Aviv remained relatively safe from rockets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/04/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "US news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Mahmoud Abbas"], "article": "The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, today agreed to resume peace talks, reversing a threat to boycott negotiations until Israel reached a truce with Hamas. In executing a swift U-turn, Abbas said in a statement: &quot;The peace process is a strategic choice and we have the intention of resuming the peace process.&quot;  He did not say when talks would restart, but the visiting US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said a US general overseeing implementation of the so-called road map would hold his first joint meeting with Israelis and Palestinians next week.  &quot;I&apos;ve been informed by the parties that they intend to resume the negotiations and that they are in contact with one another as to how to bring this about,&quot; Rice told a press conference in Jerusalem after meeting the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni. Under the road map, Israel is supposed to stop settlement activity, while the Palestinians rein in militants. Abbas, however, controls only the West Bank and has no influence over Gaza, where his Fatah forces were forcibly ejected by Hamas in June.  The return to negotiations since the Annapolis conference last November has been troubled by violence and continued Israeli construction on occupied land and relentless rocket fire from Gaza. Tensions peaked over the past week after Hamas fired long-range rockets that came closer than ever to Tel Aviv. Israel last week launched its deadliest assault on Gaza for years, killing more than 120 Palestinians, including dozens of civilians. Under pressure from Palestinians in the West Bank, Abbas had suspended negotiations because of the heavy attacks. But his abrupt volte-face under heavy US pressure risks further diminishing him among Palestinians, who are furious at the loss of Palestinian life. Abbas has condemned Hamas for its rocket attacks, but also criticised the Israeli government for its retaliation.  In the latest fighting, a month-old child died in crossfire when Israeli forces entered southern Gaza and clashed with militants overnight, Palestinian health officials said.  Two hours of shelling by tanks and missiles fired from helicopters also left a local Islamic Jihad leader dead, the officials reported. Islamic Jihad issued a statement pledging revenge attacks &quot;in the depths of the Zionist enemy, God willing&quot;. The grim backdrop, complicated by the continuing rift between Hamas and Fatah, makes it highly questionable whether the US can accomplish its goal of brokering a peace deal by the time George Bush leaves the White House in January.  Some Israeli officials have called for an invasion of Gaza to stop the barrages that last week reached as far north as the coastal city of Ashkelon, 11 miles (17km) from Gaza.  Livni was quoted as saying that Israel might be forced to return to Gaza, which it evacuated in 2005 although it controls most of the land, air and sea access to the territory. Officials later said she meant a military operation rather than reoccupation. The Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, said a large-scale operation is in the offing, indicating that Israel might try to overthrow Hamas. However, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has shrunk from a full-scale invasion because of the risk of heavy casualties among Israelis and Palestinians. Olmert said Israeli forces will not attack Gaza if Hamas and other Palestinian militants stop firing rockets at Israel. &quot;One thing should be clear: If there is no Qassam (rocket) fire on Israel, there will be no Israeli attack on Gaza. We do not rise in the morning and think about how to attack Gaza,&quot; Olmert told reporters, after his security cabinet authorised a campaign to stop the attacks and undermine Hamas. Hamas said Israel must &quot;stop all forms of aggression against our people&quot; and reopen the Gaza Strip&apos;s border crossings.

Many of its graduates have gone on to become rabbis or rightwing political leaders active in the settlement movement. One rabbi read Hebrew psalms which the crowd repeated back, line by line. Rabbi Ya&apos;akov Shapira, the head of the yeshiva, gave a eulogy critical of the Israeli government. &quot;The time has come for all of us to understand that an external struggle is raging, and an internal struggle, and everyone believes the hour has come ... for us to have a good leadership, a stronger leadership, a more believing leadership,&quot; he said, sometimes weeping as he spoke to the crowd. &quot;The murderer did not want to kill these people in particular, but everyone living in the holy city of Jerusalem,&quot; he said. He likened the shooting to attacks on the Jewish community during the British Mandate before the creation of Israel. Two of the dead were buried on the Mount of Olives overlooking Jerusalem&apos;s Old City and the Temple Mount, known as the Haram al-Sharif to Muslims. The dead were buried according to tradition with scrolls from the Torah that had been marked with their blood. The students were all aged between 15 and 19, except for one who was 26 years old. One of the teenagers was an American citizen, Avraham David Moses, 16, whose parents had immigrated to Israel in the 1990s. On Thursday night they had been in the library of the yeshiva in a crowd of around 80 students for a special prayer service. The gunman had walked through the main gate, past the dormitory and into the library, where he opened fire with a Kalashnikov and a pistol, according to police. At least six other students were seriously injured before the gunman was shot dead. It was the most serious attack in Jerusalem for four years and the worst in Israel since a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in April 2006.

This is all the unknown designer Avsh Alom Gur and his backer Marc Worth have - seven minutes to convince the arbiters of fashion of the comeback of the century, the revival of a defunct label and a dead name: Ossie Clark. The fashion press and the buyers are on the front row, watching with chilly eyes the product of four months&apos; work, presented on the etiolated forms of teenage Latvian models robed in a yellow dress, a turquoise snakeskin suit and an organza pierrot blouse. The models step on and off revolving metal plinths and rotate to a soundtrack of Jefferson Airplane&apos;s LSD anthem White Rabbit - a tribute to the 60s or, perhaps, to Clark&apos;s drug addiction. There is the silence of ennui, then a sudden, frenzied heads-down as the fashion press make notes. A long pause as the last model disappears. The designer runs through the two rooms to take his bow, and the audience briefly applaud, scramble to their feet and into taxis. It&apos;s on to the next show, which is Jasper Conran. London Fashion Week is not one long cocktail party; it is an impatient wait for shows that are running late, and other shows that are running late because the last one ran late, and nothing can start before the key editors and buyers arrive. And nothing exemplifies the reality of Fashion Week more than the brevity of these shows and the terrifying and final speed of the verdict. No time for thought, reflection, a second look. It&apos;s all in the momentary impression, the practised eye. The Ossie Clark collection, one of the week&apos;s hottest tickets, was launched at the Serpentine Gallery on a day that began with high hopes and ended with the threat of legal action by Clark&apos;s two sons. It is 12 years since the designer&apos;s appalling death, aged 54, at the hands of a former lover, and 40 since his brief, decade-long career as the signature of 60s style, in creative partnership with his wife, Celia Birtwell - a marriage that is still studied today, by visitors to the Tate gallery, in David Hockney&apos;s 1970 double portrait, Mr And Mrs Clark And Percy (their cat). In the mid-60s Clark met Alice Pollock, owner of the boutique Quorum, who placed an order for his dresses and persuaded him to team up professionally with Birtwell - a friend of his from Salford School of Art - from whom Pollock commissioned specially designed prints. Everyone wore Ossie Clark: both Mick and Bianca Jagger commissioned clothes from him; he was modelled by Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton and Penelope Tree. But by 1967 Quorum was in debt and agreed to sell out to fashion entrepreneur Alfred Radley, an unseen presence behind the flamboyant look of the swinging 60s with his Radley label, and still a thorn in the family&apos;s side all these years later. Not long after Hockney painted the couple, they split up and Clark&apos;s life would take a darker turn. He would get lost in drugs, would go bankrupt, would eke out a minor living, supported by Radley, who would try to harness his creative imagination to production for the mass market; the Ossie Clark label became Ossie Clark for Radley. The long, troubled relationship with Radley is an object lesson in the tensions between genius and business. Clark had been the great wild card of the 60s, a brilliant flash in the pan, destroyed by a combination of economic downturn and the flaws in his own personality. In 1996 he would die penniless. Of the Ossie Clark name, there was nothing for his two sons by Birtwell - George and Albert, now in their late 30s - to inherit. Radley owned it and his archive of sketches, samples and press cuttings. It was Birtwell who would go on quietly designing, and triumphantly revive her career with sell-out collections at Topshop in the past couple of years. Word broke in the fashion press last October that the defunct Ossie Clark label was to be revived. Revivals have been the mode of the times. Halston was brought back from the dead in New York this February - another victim of burnout who, after being synonymous with the Studio 54 era, had died forgotten. Biba, the label begun by Barbara Hulanicki in 1964, was brought back in 2006, under the initial direction of Bella Freud. In 2002 Lanvin was successfully revived by Israeli designer Alber Elbaz. The press launch last autumn at the new Ossie Clark studio off Upper Street in Islington, north London, introduced a team of unknowns headed by creative director Avsh Alom Gur, a graduate of the same Tel Aviv fashion school as Elbaz. Gur&apos;s credentials were impressive - he had worked for Chlo\u00e9, Roberto Cavalli, Nicole Farhi and Donna Karan - but he had yet to establish his own name. All there was to show in the studio were some toiles (calico versions of dresses yet to be made up), a few original Clark pieces - including a cropped snakeskin jacket with rivets originally inserted, unevenly, by a member of Pink Floyd - and a lot of press cuttings showing Clark and Birtwell&apos;s work in its heyday. The team announced that they would be putting together their first collection in time for London Fashion Week, four months later. Everyone at the launch looked around to see if Birtwell was there, or at least the two sons. In a statement, the new company declared that the Clark family had been notified at an early stage and their ongoing involvement was a matter for continued negotiations. Gur told me he had personally opened his design studio to Birtwell. There was widespread coverage of the launch, but nothing further was heard from the Clarks, at least in the media. The figure behind the relaunch is 46-year-old Marc Worth, a quieter and less bulky version of Harvey Weinstein, the American film mogul who bought Halston. Together with his brother Julian, Worth had in 1998 set up WGSN (Worth Global Style Network), a fashion industry website specialising in forecasting and trend analysis. The brothers started it with \u00a31m of their own money and sold it seven years later to media group Emap for \u00a3140m. Why Ossie Clark, I asked at the press launch. &quot;He had so much potential, and it was unfulfilled,&quot; Worth said. &quot;He was one of the most creative talents this country has ever produced, an amazing man who made some beautiful clothes - feminine, effortless, unlimited and relevant. They were fantastic to wear and made the women who wore them feel taller, sexier, freer.&quot; Unlike Weinstein, Worth was not an outsider to fashion; clothing is his family tree. His father ran a family lace-making business in Frankfurt; just before the war a British lace manufacturer sponsored him to slip out under the cage of Nazi control, and he found himself starting afresh in Nottingham, running a company specialising in embroidery, then trims. Marc hated education and loved the family business. At 16 he left school and joined his father and brother in the garment trade, more interested in fashion than in accounting. &quot;I loved going to the shows,&quot; he said. &quot;I got a buzz out of the creativity. I didn&apos;t need to go, I had a team covering them, but I was always asking them to get me tickets.&quot; Worth is involved in various Jewish charities, particularly related to Israel, where he has a second home, and in 2006 he was asked to organise a fundraising fashion show. He wanted to rope in an Israeli designer. The obvious name was Lanvin&apos;s Alber Elbaz, but he was too major-league for a one-off charity event, so Worth flew to Israel to find a new face. On the plane he sat next to Suzy Menkes (the International Herald Tribune&apos;s influential fashion writer) and asked if she could recommend someone. She gave him the name of a recent graduate, Avsh Alom Gur. Gur&apos;s father had arrived in Israel from Germany after the war, a child survivor; he became an architect and married a painter. &quot;My parents grew up without parents, so there were no boundaries, and it would form my character,&quot; Gur says. The charity show never happened (the Lebanon war happened instead), but for the next two or three seasons Worth anonymously supported Gur&apos;s collections. Back in the 70s, Radley had persuaded both Clark and Birtwell to design what are thought to be the earliest known diffusion lines, taking their work into the high street and reaching far beyond a small, well-heeled clientele. It was Radley who wanted to ;see Ossie Clark relaunched. &quot;It is his life&apos;s obsession,&quot; Worth says. It was Radley who lobbied the V&amp;A to hold its landmark Ossie Clark retrospective in 2003. Worth, together with his daughter, who was a fashion student, went to see Radley, now aged 83 and living in St John&apos;s Wood with his elderly poodle. &quot;We saw this amazing archive,&quot; Worth says, &quot;hundreds of items, file after file of press cuttings and sketches. My daughter said, &apos;Dad, we&apos;ve got to do this.&apos; &quot; Over the next couple of months, Worth negotiated a deal with Radley giving him a worldwide exclusive licence over the names Ossie Clark and Quorum. For a while there were negotiations with Vanja Strok and Nargess Gharani, the design team behind Gharani Strok, an established London label, but the deal fell through. In the end Worth took Gur to lunch, asked him which three British designers he&apos;d revive if he had the chance, and when Gur named Clark second (after Jean Muir), he got the job. There seemed something risky, quixotic - romantic even - about the enterprise. Nobody has ever made millions backing British fashion, at least the creative side, I pointed out to Worth, so why did he think he could succeed when everyone else had failed? &quot;When I took a year off [after the sale of WGSN], I thought, there&apos;s no point me doing anything unless it can be a serious business,&quot; he said. &quot;The overheads are very high in this business, but in my view, if you don&apos;t throw a lot of money at it, you won&apos;t succeed. The problem for British fashion is money. I&apos;m going to have to sink three million quid into this. It&apos;s going to cost us \u00a3120,000 to do our show, but it&apos;s the only way to get the exposure, the buzz and the interest.&quot; Worth then revealed some of the bad blood behind the scenes between Birtwell and her sons, and Radley. &quot;There&apos;s no love lost between Al Radley and Celia Birtwell,&quot; he said. &quot;So when Celia heard the news of the relaunch, she was not thrilled. In fact, she went ballistic. The bigger issue is with the sons - they had a lot of problems with Al Radley.&quot; At the time of this conversation, which took place in mid-January, Worth had just offered George and Albert Clark what he described as &quot;a small piece of the business completely free&quot; and was waiting to hear their response. As the weeks went by, they were apparently in negotiations. Within a month of the launch, the Ossie Clark revival had begun to take shape. A few dresses were starting to appear, lengths of cloth were arriving from far-flung spots (some not what they had ordered), sewing machines making samples were quietly whirring. Gur, in black jeans and T-shirt, his hands weighted with rings and bracelets, explained that, from the start, his concept for the Clark revival had been what he considered the DNA of the name: fluid femininity. There would be, he promised, a lot...#8239;of silks, a lot of drape. There were dangers in relaunching in the middle of an ever-unpredictable fashion cycle, I suggested, but Gur was undeterred: &quot;If you are trying to create a house with longevity, you don&apos;t care about what&apos;s fashionable at the moment,&quot; he replied. What was bothering him was a yellow dress, not quite a copy of an original Ossie Clark, but demonstrably inspired by it. &quot;I resent this dress,&quot; he said. You could see him trying to pull free of Ossie. He showed me another dress, a long, red, beautifully cut column. &quot;This is me,&quot; he said. I told him I thought it was the best dress in the collection. &quot;Yes, it&apos;s the most fashion forward,&quot; he agreed. From the outset, he&apos;d understood the difficulty of reviving a designer with such a distinctive style. &quot;I really want it to work,&quot; he told me, &quot;but if I am not to be successful, at least I will know I have done something I believe in.&quot; As the dresses were gathering shape in the atelier, I asked around to find out what people thought of the very idea of reviving Ossie Clark. &quot;Ossie Clark was a great designer,&quot; Alexandra Shulman, editor of UK Vogue, said. &quot;He had a totally original take, he captured the collective imagination. His partnership with Celia Birtwell was very important, too, but he was one of those personality designers and people forget how the persona of a designer is important to the brand. You can&apos;t just take a name that&apos;s good and put in an untried and untested designer. It&apos;s a very high-risk strategy. But we do need men like Marc Worth in London. Fashion needs people who understand that building up brands takes time, so I&apos;d give him 110% for trying.&quot; A few days before the show, Gur was consumed by the collection: &quot;This comes before my family, before my personal life, before hunger, before toilet, I have no idea what is happening in the news, I&apos;m totally in isolation,&quot; he said. Meanwhile Worth claims he was becoming more and more confident that he had done a deal with George and Albert Clark. They had, he told me, more or less shaken hands on it the Friday before the show on February 11, and he was expecting them to take place of honour on the big day. When it came, Worth and his wife and daughter stood waiting for the fashion press to arrive, and for George and Albert. All the most important figures in London fashion turned up, including Shulman, Menkes and the elegant figure of 82-year-old Joan Burstein, the hugely influential owner of the South Molton Street boutique Browns - but not the Clark brothers. And then the seven minutes started. And then they were over. The audience briefly applauded, and ran. I asked Gur how he felt. &quot;I feel like I just gave birth and my child has been taken away from me,&quot; he said, semi-shocked, deflated. I managed to catch Joan Burstein before she left; she, after all, had witnessed every fashion revolution of the past 60 years, beginning with Dior&apos;s New Look. &quot;I liked the three dresses that were most Ossie,&quot; she said, &quot;the yellow dress at the beginning.&quot; This was the yellow dress that Gur had &quot;resented&quot;. Two things happened next. The first was a press release from Albert and George Clark - &quot;The Trademark &apos;Ossie Clark&apos; was registered by Alfred Radley of Radley Royalties in 1999 without the family&apos;s knowledge or consent. The trademark was then licensed to a Marc Worth company in 2007, again without the family&apos;s knowledge and consent. Ossie Clark&apos;s sons object to how their father&apos;s name is now being commercially exploited in a way that he would not have wanted and without their consent. They did not attend Monday&apos;s relaunch and are considering taking legal action to reclaim their father&apos;s name.&quot; Worth quickly responded. &quot;Today&apos;s spoiling tactic adopted by the Clarks is an unwelcome distraction from the excitement of the launch,&quot; it read. &quot;However Quorum, having taken appropriate advice at all stages, are clear that they have all authorisations needed and look forward to building a new future for this incredible label that had remained dormant since the founder&apos;s death.&quot; Neither Birtwell nor her sons have spoken about the relaunch. A request for an interview was turned down. The words &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;an emotional issue&quot; have been used to describe the family&apos;s reactions, particularly those of the sons. Evidently they feel that their father has been stolen from them. In an interview shortly before the show, Birtwell tactfully said, &quot;No one has asked me to be involved, and I will keep saying the same old thing, which is, if it&apos;s great, it&apos;s very nice to put Ossie&apos;s name forward. I&apos;ve done it in my way and I think he would have been proud of me, and if they do it beautifully, I will be the first to say so.&quot; Birtwell&apos;s ensuing silence can perhaps be explained by the second shock, the next-day reviews, which were lukewarm. Many papers found the collection too much like Ossie Clark, too influenced by the 70s, almost, as Hadley Freeman wrote in this paper, fancy dress. The prints were felt to be well below Birtwell&apos;s standards; the block colours fared better. Worth rang a few days after the launch and I asked how he felt about the aftermath, and what had provoked what he saw as the sudden turnaround on the part of Clark&apos;s sons. &quot;Not a clue,&quot; he said. &quot;On the Friday we had almost shaken hands on an agreement and I expected it to be signed before the show. I have no idea what&apos;s going on. But there are three parties [Birtwell and her two sons], so maybe one of them didn&apos;t agree. I would never have gone into the venture if I hadn&apos;t been 100% sure that the trademark was 100% watertight. If they&apos;re going to take any action, it&apos;s against Radley. He&apos;s quite shocked. Upset, but not surprised. But I think they know that they haven&apos;t got a leg to stand on from a legal point of view. &quot;I&apos;m not disappointed,&quot; he said of the reviews. &quot;There&apos;s no way anyone is going to rave over our first collection - most of them were pretty much sitting on the fence. We&apos;ve got a lot to prove. I think there were mistakes made by the stylist: 50% of those looks were very Ossie-ish and that&apos;s too high a proportion. This idea of the revolving plinths - the models didn&apos;t look confident because they were too worried about falling off. The whole atmosphere rubs off on the clothes. We have to think where to go from here.&quot; In the end, the only thing that mattered was the event that took place away from the cameras, behind closed doors: the buyers&apos; appointments at the Sanderson hotel. &quot;The thing that is really encouraging is the reaction of the buyers, which has been fantastic,&quot; Worth said. &quot;There were 30 or 40 appointments and all but two have placed orders.&quot; He named every major department store and retailer in Britain and New York, including Browns. Ossie Clark&apos;s life became a mess, but he made dresses women loved to wear, which made them feel sexy and feminine. And this is the prize Worth, Gur and the team are seeking. To find a fashion formula and make it pay. To please women. I wish them well for trying and, yes, I&apos;ll order a dress.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-08T00:12:23Z", "title": "Linda Granton on the struggle to bring Ossie Clark, the king of King's road, back to life", "sentences": ["The press launch last autumn at the new Ossie Clark studio off Upper Street in Islington, north London, introduced a team of unknowns headed by creative director Avsh Alom Gur, a graduate of the same Tel Aviv fashion school as Elbaz."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/08/fashion.londonfashionweek"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Football", "Books"], "article": "The most embarrassing journey I have ever made was to see the England football team take on Israel in the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv. This was last year, when we still had a chance of qualifying for Euro 2008.  I had managed to snag myself a Club Class ticket on British Airways, which was a relief, given the antics of England&apos;s Barmy Army in the back of the plane, and found myself sitting next to a middle-aged man reading a self-help book. &apos;Probably an American businessman,&apos; I thought to myself. &apos;I hope to God he doesn&apos;t try and strike up a conversation.&apos; Once we were airborne, a man appeared beside me clutching a piece of paper and shuffling from foot to foot. &apos;Sorry to disturb,&apos; he said. &apos;I don&apos;t suppose I could trouble you for an autograph?&apos; &apos;Of course,&apos; I said, reaching for the piece of paper. &apos;Who shall I make it out to?&apos; &apos;Not you,&apos; said the man. &apos;Him.&apos; The person sitting next to me duly obliged, and as he signed his name I peered over his shoulder, curious to see who it was. I couldn&apos;t make it out. After the autograph hunter had returned to his seat, I continued to stare at this mysterious celebrity, searching his face for clues. Then the penny dropped: it was Glenn Hoddle, the former England manager. He must have noticed the light bulb appearing above my head because at precisely that moment he cast his eyes down and pretended to be absorbed in his book. No doubt he was thinking: &apos;Please God, don&apos;t let this plonker in a cross of St George T-shirt talk to me.&apos; &apos;So, Mr Hoddle,&apos; I said, virtually leaning over and snapping his book shut, &apos;why do players who perform brilliantly at a club level stop trying when they put on an England shirt?&apos; &apos;It always makes me laugh when people say that footballers aren&apos;t trying hard enough,&apos; he replied. &apos;They always try as hard as they can.&apos; &apos;But in today&apos;s Daily Mail,&apos; I said, waving the paper in his face, &apos;Rio Ferdinand&apos;s agent says the reason England failed to make an impression in the World Cup is because the players only gave 30 per cent.&apos; He gave a snort of derision. &apos;Are you talking about Pini Zahavi?&apos; I scanned the paper. &apos;Yes,&apos; I said. &apos;See that six-year-old over there?&apos; he said, pointing out a little girl across the aisle. &apos;I&apos;d rather ask her opinion than Pini Zahavi&apos;s.&apos; This wasn&apos;t going as well as I&apos;d hoped. It was time to steer the conversation on to safer ground. The essential thing was to impress him with my intimate knowledge of the game. Once he realised I was a true fan, he&apos;d relax. &apos;So,&apos; I said, trying to sound authoritative, &apos;why has McClaren left Paul Scholes out of the squad? That has got to be a textbook error.&apos; &apos;I wouldn&apos;t say that,&apos; he replied. &apos;Scholes announced his retirement from international football in 2004.&apos; &apos;Ah, right, yes, I see.&apos; I racked my brains, desperately trying to think of a decent player who was eligible for the squad but who McClaren had failed to select. &apos;What about Craig Bellamy?&apos; I said. &apos;I know he&apos;s a bit of a bad boy, but he could cause Israel&apos;s defence some real problems.&apos; &apos;I agree with you,&apos; he said. &apos;The problem is, Bellamy is Welsh.&apos; With that, the former England manager returned to his self-help book.  England ended up drawing nil-nil with Israel.

Palestinian society is in many ways deeply conservative and traditional, so those who identify as LGBTQ often face harsh reactions from their families and communities, ranging from social ostracism to physical violence. At the same time, LGBTQ Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories regularly face discrimination, denials of civil and human rights, and other forms of violence and inequality as a result of their Palestinian identity. LGBTQ Palestinians are often urged to choose between being Palestinian and being queer, but these problems are not separable: as LGBTQ Palestinians, our sexual/gender identities and our national/cultural identities are inextricably linked - both in how we understand and identify ourselves and in the struggles we face as individuals and as a community. Troubled by the absence of an organisation that caters to the specific needs of our community, we - a group of LGBTQ Palestinians who live in Israel and the occupied territories - founded al-Qaws (Arabic for &quot;rainbow&quot;), which became the first legally recognised, autonomous Palestinian LGBTQ organisation in November last year. Motivated by a vision of a non-hierarchical society that recognises - and values - the diversity of sexual and gender identities, al-Qaws aspires to play a pioneering role in helping to build a just Palestinian society based on tolerance, equality, and openness. We believe that such a society will serve as a source of freedom and creativity and will enrich the lives, not only of LGBTQ Palestinians, but Palestinians in general. Founded as an autonomous project within the Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance (JOH) in 2001, al-Qaws obtained non-profit status and became an independent legal entity at the culmination of an intense process of organisational and group work among our leadership group that began in September 2006. Our desire to form an independent organisation was based on our conviction that this was the only way we could adequately address our specific and growing needs as Palestinian LGBTQs and provide a forum for internal dialogue about our multiple identities and our relationship with Palestinian society at large. The particular social context in which we live and work provided the original catalyst for al-Qaws, but it also shapes our overall mission and our daily work. In contrast to many western societies, where queer communities and movements have matured over the past several decades, the queer Palestinian community is still nascent, at best. Besides that, the dominant western constructs of queer identity do not have the same relevance for many Palestinians, who are left without a culturally meaningful set of narratives around which to organise a movement and understand their identities and desires. The result is that most LGBTQ Palestinians face two equally unsatisfactory options. One is to conform with local cultural norms and live outwardly &quot;heterosexual&quot; lives. The other is to risk persecution by adopting an identity that many Palestinians associate with the west. Al-Qaws is therefore determined, not simply to mimic an existing model of queer identity/community, but to provide a social space for LGBTQ Palestinians to independently engage in a dialogue about our own visions and ideals for a community. More broadly, we aim to promote transformation and change in Palestinian society by, on one hand, challenging social attitudes and religious taboos about sexuality and gender and, on the other hand, advancing the social engagement and contributions of LGBTQ Palestinians through empowerment, education, and the development of leadership skills. At the same time, however, we emphasise that LGBTQ Palestinians face pressures, not just from Palestinian society, but from the wider context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. LGBTQ Palestinians&apos; struggles are a complex result of problems internal to Palestinian society and the harsh realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Al-Qaws aims to serve the needs of LGBTQ Palestinians with an eye to both sides of this equation, and although we are hopeful and determined, we are also recognise the limits the political situation places on our ability to bring change. For example, while Palestinians in Israel, Jerusalem, and the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza constitute one community, our different legal statuses and the different realities of each of these locations - including, for example, restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza - severely constrain our ability to meet as a community. Despite these obstacles, al-Qaws is actively engaged in promoting the development and growth of the Palestinian LGBTQ community in Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. Because this process is inherently linked with the wider struggle to build an equal, diverse, tolerant and open society, al-Qaws is an enthusiastic partner with those who share our vision of a vibrant Palestinian civil society that honours the human and civil rights of all individuals, including those who do not conform to cultural or religious norms of gender and sexuality. Al-Qaws is currently engaged, for example, in the preparatory stages of a joint research project with local human rights organisations in the West Bank. This innovative project will examine, for the first time ever, attitudes of social justice activists, human rights activists, and LGBTQs in the West Bank toward the taboo topic of sexual diversity/orientation. This research will draw attention to the problem of LGBTQ civil and human rights in Palestinian society, inform the scope of our future awareness-raising programmes and educational outreach, and ultimately, we hope, initiate public debates among human rights, women&apos;s, and social justice organisations on frequently ignored issues of gender and sexual identity. Another upcoming research project of al-Qaws will investigate alternatives to the western model of homosexuality/sexual diversity, informed by our own cultures, values, and histories. The western model, in which &quot;visibility&quot; and &quot;coming out of the closet&quot; are central motifs, is not practical or meaningful for many LGBTQ Palestinians. In order to deal effectively with the actual experiences and needs of LGBTQ Palestinians, a new and more relevant model that responds to our unique historical and cultural context is urgently needed. In addition to these long-term research projects, al-Qaws is engaged in regular projects that have immediate impacts on the lives of LGBTQ Palestinians in Jerusalem, Yaffa-Tel Aviv, the northern region of Israel, and the West Bank (as often as possible given the political limitations). For example, we have organised workshops to develop activist and leadership skills among LGBTQ Palestinians, as well as meetings to discuss issues of sexuality and gender more generally. Additionally, because one of our goals is to provide a safe space for members of the community, we regularly organise social events where LGBTQ Palestinians can feel free to meet and socialise. And al-Qaws&apos;s LGBTQ Arabic website, one of few such websites, has been a particularly valuable tool, both for networking and educational purposes. More than 1,000 people from Israel-Palestine and beyond have participated in Arabic discussion forums on issues of gender and sexuality since we developed the site. These are only a few of the many projects in which al-Qaws is engaged, and we are constantly searching for new and innovative ways to respond to the diverse needs of LGBTQ Palestinians. To be sure, ours is not an easy job. We are fully aware of the complexities of this moment and the challenges that lie ahead. But our move towards independence is an exciting change, and we believe that it will open new opportunities for LGBTQ Palestinians - and also, if less directly, for all Israelis and Palestinians - to imagine, and create, a future based on equality and respect for our differences, rather than the petty prejudices and injustices that characterise so many of our lives.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-10T07:00:00Z", "title": "Rainbow over Palestine", "sentences": ["In addition to these long-term research projects, al-Qaws is engaged in regular projects that have immediate impacts on the lives of LGBTQ Palestinians in Jerusalem, Yaffa-Tel Aviv, the northern region of Israel, and the West Bank (as often as possible given the political limitations)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/10/rainbowoverpalestine"}, {"tags": ["World news"], "article": "George W Bush has given December 12 2008 as the deadline by which a two-state solution needs to be reached. Given the current round of conflict, it would need a miracle to see this realised. While the Holy Land has witnessed no shortage of miracles in its time, things are looking particularly bleak. However, it doesn&apos;t have to be this way. The majority of Israelis and Palestinians want peace. Most of the world does too. While we claim to represent no one but ourselves, we reserve the right to believe in miracles and feel the following needs to be acknowledged and acted upon for peace to return to the Holy Land: 1) We condemn all innocent loss of life because of this ongoing conflict, which has affected thousands of families on both sides of the divide, all of whom are forever scarred by the tragic sacrifice they were forced to make. We support the work of joint Israeli-Palestinian projects that calls for recognition of &quot;the right of both people to independence, sovereignty, freedom, justice, dignity and respect&quot;. 2) We believe there are only two lasting solutions to the conflict: A two state solution of a sovereign Israel and a sovereign Palestine; or a one state solution encompassing all of Israel/Palestine. Given the latter option appears unworkable in the present climate, thanks to the apparently insurmountable opposition to it from several major players in the peace process, we have opted for the former solution as being the best interim option. 3) As part of the two-state solution, Israel needs to cease its occupation of all lands occupied since 1967 and remove all illegal settlements. Palestinians need to accept that resistance is over and forgo, in return for reparations, their right to return to pre-1967 Israel. This requires agreement between all sides, including Hamas. 4) Palestinians must accept that terrorism, such as suicide bombings or rockets being fired into Jewish villages, is wrong and has brought them nothing but misery in response. No future Palestinian state will be born out of terror. Only a non-violent resistance in partnership with Israeli civil society would compel the Israeli government to concede peace. 5) Israel&apos;s continual occupation and land grabs have weakened the moderates, boosted the extremists and made their own citizens less safe. The Israeli government needs to accept that Palestinian violence, whilst reprehensible, does not emanate from a vacuum. Reducing Palestinians to the brutalities and indignity of occupation with the resultant collective punishment, killings, abject poverty and hopelessness is neither an acceptable nor workable method of dealing with Palestinian grievances. 6) East Jerusalem (whilst in post-1967 lands) should be the shared symbolic capital of both states (with Tel Aviv and Ramallah being the respective administrative capitals) with Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders ensuring their respective holy sites are maintained and remain open to all worshipers. The argument that Jerusalem is more important to Jews than Muslims or vice versa will never be resolved in this world and will need to be deferred to God. 7) The Muslim world should recognise Israel, normalise relations and trade with it. The Israel conflict has long been used by Arab despots to divert attention from their own misrule. 8) While the stalemate appears intractable at present, there is much to be positive about on ground level. The people on both sides are tired of decades of hostilities, and their opposition to the fighting must not be drowned out by politicians and militants who currently hold the reins of power. Only then will the region blossom into the model of coexistence and harmony that it quite clearly has the potential to be.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-10T12:00:00Z", "title": "We believe in miracles", "sentences": ["6) East Jerusalem (whilst in post-1967 lands) should be the shared symbolic capital of both states (with Tel Aviv and Ramallah being the respective administrative capitals) with Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders ensuring their respective holy sites are maintained and remain open to all worshipers."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/10/westillbelieveinmiracles"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Cultural trips"], "article": "A new service launched on Monday offers customers the chance never to be lost in translation again.

At the time, his doom-laden predictions of civil war and regional chaos seemed far-fetched. Now they seem far less so.  From the distant, tsunami-struck tip of Sumatra to Wall Street, from the specialist world of counter-terrorism to that of contemporary feminist literary criticism, the war, the occupation and the continuing conflict in Iraq have left their mark. The effects will not be known for some time, but some broad effects are already all too evident. The Iraq of the Nineties - run by a nationalist, broadly secular Sunni Muslim elite; brutalised and terrorised, but stable under Saddam Hussein - has been replaced by a weak, violent, unstable state racked by a largely communitarian civil war and crime. Where once the fear in Ankara, Riyadh, Tehran or Tel Aviv was of an unpredictable dictator, now it is of a spillover of chaos. Though we should be mindful always that the events of 2003-2008 in Iraq were not inscribed on a blank slate but in a region rich in historical events, processes and actors, clearly the war has wrought radical change in its own right as well as accelerating or exposing ongoing evolution. Watching the American tanks lined up on the embankments of the Tigris in Baghdad in the spring of 2003 was, for me at least, a shock. The incongruity of these men and machines in the streets where, a year earlier, visiting reporters had sat to eat grilled fish at outdoor restaurants with their Ministry of Information minders was stunning. From being a distant superpower, whose interest in the Middle East was always intermittent, the US is now implanted in the region. &apos;America has become a neighbour, not a superpower,&apos; said Shmuel Bar of the Multidisciplinary Research Centre in Israel. There is little chance, whatever presidential candidates pledge, of American disengagement in the near future. The war has brought about a major shift in the local balance of power - though not the one the White House planned. The biggest regional winner in the conflict appears to be Iran. Tehran&apos;s major historical rival has been profoundly weakened, and there is a leadership vacuum in the Islamic world, in no small part due to the loss of credibility with &apos;the street&apos; of rulers such as King Abdullah of Jordan or the House of al-Saud. Iran has been assuming, as it did after the Islamic revolution of 1979, the role of spearhead state leading the Muslim masses against those international enemies who oppose their interests.  Iran&apos;s position is also bolstered by the democracy and demography in Iraq. Though their national identity remains strong, Iraq&apos;s Shia majority have closer cultural, social, religious and commercial links with Iran than with the minority Sunni. Given their numbers and thus their dominance of any conceivable democratic system in their homeland, it is difficult to see how the Iraqi Sunnis can seriously threaten their Shia compatriots&apos; power. The result: though fears of a regional Shia alliance of Lebanese Hizbollah (backed by Iran), Shia Iraqis and Shia hardliners in Tehran may be exaggerated, the Shia-Sunni tensions that rack the region are, if not unprecedented, then certainly impressive in their intensity. They are a consequence of the war. The fact that a Shia community is running an Arab country for the first time cannot but profoundly change the balance of power in the region. If things were going better for America in Iraq, the new strength of Iran would matter less. However, the quagmire in which 140,000 American troops have become mired means that few can now be expected to follow Libya&apos;s Colonel Gadaffi and renounce opposition to &apos;the West&apos; through fear of US-led retribution. This has led to a paradoxical position. Now they have broken the taboo that for decades meant that marching on capitals to overturn regimes was unacceptable, the Americans cannot now exploit their new theoretical freedom to act.  &apos;The most dangerous consequence of the war in Iraq is that it has destroyed America&apos;s ability to intervene where necessary,&apos; said Yahia Saeed of the London School of Economics. &apos;It has shown the US to be vulnerable and incapable in many ways.&apos; The hardline Iranian leadership is therefore confident enough to ignore American sabre-rattling and continue with its controversial nuclear programme. This, in turn, according to Shmuel Bar, could mean the end of the control of nuclear proliferation, leading to a &apos;poly-nuclear&apos; Middle East, with consequences for states like North Korea. The American ability to intervene has suffered for other reasons too, perhaps harder to remedy than military weakness. &apos;The war in Iraq has led to the loss of the moral authority of the West. No one takes the UK and the US seriously any more,&apos; said Professor Ali Ansari of St Andrews University in Scotland. &apos;Playing fast and loose with international law means it is now very difficult to invoke the same body of law when we need to.&apos;  Certainly the credibility of the involvement of such figures as Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is now shaky, and the continuing existence of Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the scandal at Abu Ghraib prison has also undermined any criticism of human rights abuses anywhere else.  The Bush administration&apos;s abandonment of its previously vociferous, if unconvincing, advocacy of democratic reform in the Islamic world is one indirect result. Another consequence of the various failures of the Iraq war has been to discredit the post-Cold War doctrines of intervention formulated and tested in the Nineties. From early disasters such as that of Somalia in 1993, through to more successful operations in Sierra Leone, Kosovo and Afghanistan, a range of new foreign policy options were tried out. Iraq was their apogee and their grave. One reason is the huge impact the war has had on public opinion in the countries from which the troops and the cash for such operations have to come. For Afghanistan, this indirect effect of the war in Iraq has had devastating consequences. The country was already struggling to keep global attention only a few months after the blitzkrieg that removed the Taliban and evicted Osama bin Laden&apos;s al-Qaeda from its training camps was over.  Not only were crucial military resources being diverted to Iraq by the autumn of 2002, but political attention thinned out too. The lack of serious reconstruction or military effort was obvious to anyone travelling through south-east Afghanistan even in late 2004. Thousands of square miles of strategically crucial territory had been left to rot. Villagers in the back country around Kandahar saw no benefit from the invasion, merely growing insecurity. No one should have been surprised in 2006 to find that, while the world had been looking away, the Taliban had quietly returned to their old haunts. In addition, the marketing of the Iraq war means that Western governments are having a hard time selling another unpopular war to domestic populations sceptical after swallowing the various empty claims about weapons of mass destruction. And what of the global battle for hearts and minds, the struggle that is now widely agreed to be the &apos;strategic centre of gravity&apos; of what was once known as the &apos;war on terror&apos; but, in Britain at least, has been relabelled in less inflammatory language? Few now try, as British ministers once did, to argue that the invasion of Iraq and the continuing threat from modern radical Islamic militancy are not related. Interview Muslim militants anywhere in the world and they will tell you how the West is set on the division, humiliation and subordination of the Ummah, the world&apos;s Muslim community. That the invasion of Iraq has reinforced this &apos;single narrative&apos; is now taken as a given by intelligence services in the UK, the US and elsewhere. Their analytic efforts are now directed at understanding why certain individuals are vulnerable to that ideology, not whether the invasion of Iraq has boosted militants&apos; propaganda. One question worrying Western intelligence services is why the &apos;blowback&apos; that was so feared - the hundreds or even thousands of hardened &apos;Iraqi veterans&apos; who would return to Europe or elsewhere to sow terror - has not yet occurred. This is &apos;the dog that so far has not barked,&apos; according to one intelligence official. It may just be a question of time. The dog has very definitely barked in Lebanon, where a militant Sunni group fought a small war against local forces last year, and in Algeria, where Iraq veterans have spearheaded a fusion between local militants and the &apos;al-Qaeda central&apos; high command based in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Yet al-Qaeda itself has struggled with Iraq, never succeeding in imposing itself on a complex, evolving insurgency. Bin Laden&apos;s attempt to appropriate the Iraqi &apos;jihad&apos; has failed. Instead, the excesses of psychopathic commanders like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi have revolted many potential militant supporters inside and outside the country, and a fierce row has now broken out among jihadi ideologues in the Middle East about the viability and desirability of violent strategies. Indeed, it is noticeable that the closer you get to the experience of terrorist violence - dismembered babies, bereaved mothers, incinerated corpses of policemen - the lower the support for the militants is among the general population. It is in Morocco, Syria, Saudi Arabia and among the troubled elements of European Muslim communities that the call to arms of the &apos;Iraqi Islamic mujahideen&apos; has had significant resonance - not in &apos;the land of the two rivers&apos;, as the militants know it.  Good news is thin, but Saddam is gone, though what followed him is arguably a greater threat than he ever was and tens, if not hundreds of thousands, have died. Much is still unclear - such as the consequences of the massive outflow of Iraqi refugees or the potential of newly discovered oilfields.  One positive outcome is that, having learnt from their mistakes, the Americans and their allies are building a body of counter-insurgency, reconstruction and peace-building know-how that could, given the right circumstances, serve well in the decades to come. Ansari at St Andrews notes that Britain is now engaging seriously with the Middle East - with army officers going on Arabic or Farsi courses - for the first time since the early Seventies.  These are expensive &apos;silver linings&apos; to a fairly dark cloud, says Saeed at the LSE, though they may augur better times for the future. The war of 2003 was supposed to transform the Middle East, the broader Islamic world and its relations with the West. It was meant to release a wave of beneficial change.  A transformation has happened, but not the one desired by the US and UK. If there is one law that has dominated events, it is the law of unintended consequences. Sadly, the result is that the gloomy predictions of the illiterate truck driver I interviewed at Zakho have largely come to pass.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-16T18:35:32Z", "title": "The Iraq War: Five Years On: And the biggest winner  is ...

Has there been anyone who has played top-flight football on five different continents?&quot; Many of you (including Dave Holley, Owen Arthur, Saif Ammous and others) cited the Brazilian globe-trotting goal-machine Rom\u00e1rio de Souza Faria as notching more than 1,000 goals across five different continents. Having begun his career in his native South America (Vasco de Gama), he ticked off Europe (PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Valencia) before taking in Asia (Al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar), Australia (Adelaide United) and North America (Miami FC). But, says the eagle-eyed David Willbe, the &quot;minor fly in the ointment&quot; of that answer is that the question referred to top-flight football and Miami FC, played in the second tier of US football. But wait, David&apos;s not finished: &quot;There&apos;s one other I can think of, but it&apos;s not without controversy.&quot; he says, giving with one hand and taking away with t&apos;other. The man he speaks of is Osvaldo Nartallo who began his career at San Lorenzo (Argentina, South America), played for the Orlando Pirates (South Africa, in, Africa) in 1993 and towards the twilight of his career wore the kit of Queretaro (Mexico, North America) prior to their relegation in 2001. &quot;In the interim he spent some time in Turkey, and this is where it gets a little cheeky,&quot; says David, spicing things up somewhat, &quot;even though Turkey is part of Europe in footballing terms, in geographical terms parts of Turkey are in Asia.&quot; Osvaldo played one season for Besiktas (in the European part) and one season for the gloriously-named Petrol Ofisi GK Ankara (in the Asian part) who, the season previously, had obtained promotion to the top flight of Turkish football. So, strictly geographically, Nartallo played for a top-flight club on five continents. Jim Wraith reckons Lutz Pfannenstiel can top that. The goalkeeper, last spotted playing at Clube Atletico Hermann Aichinger, has played on a remarkable six continents. Since 1991, he has appeared for (deep breath) FC Bad Kotzting, Penang FA, Wimbledon, Nottingham Forest, Sint-Truidense, Hamrun Spartans, Sembawang Rangers, Orlando Pirates, Nottingham Forest, TPV, Nottingham Forest (again), SV Wacker Burghausen, Geylang United, Dunedin Technical, Bradford Park Avenue, ASV Cham, Dunedin Technical (again), Bradford Park Avenue (again), Dunedin Technical (and again), Baerum SK, Calgary Mustangs, Otago United, KS Vllaznia Shkod&apos;r, Baerum SK (again), Vancouver Whitecaps, and the aforementioned Club Atletico Hermann Aichinger (and relax). But it&apos;s a case of so near yet so far for Pfannenstiel. Though he has played top-flight football on four continents - in Europe (with Sint-Truidense of Belgium and Hamrun Spartans of Malta), Asia (Penang FA of Malaysia and Sembawang Rangers and Geylang United of Singapore), Africa (with South Africa&apos;s Orlando Pirates), and Oceania (Dunedin Technical and Otago United of New Zealand) - his current South American club, Club Atletico Hermann Aichinger, play in the equivalent of the Brazilian fourth division, while his spells in North America with Vancouver Whitecaps and Calgary Mustang, says Liam McGuigan, were in the A-league (the second tier of US football). LOCAL BOYS MADE GOOD &quot;I can recall reading somewhere that the Celtic team that won the European Cup in the 1960s was pretty much comprised of players from the Glasgow area (within a 30-miles radius),&quot; wrote Liam from Sligo. &quot;That being the case, has any club since then matched that feat in either winning a European/domestic competition?&quot; Morten Sorensen from Aarhus in Denmark is all over this one like a flannel. &quot;Celtic&apos;s achievement was matched in the 1973-74 Cup Winners&apos; Cup final. The unlikely winner, FC Magdeburg, beat the mighty Milan 2-0 with a team containing 11 players from the Magdeburg area.&quot; What&apos;s more, Magdeburg also won the DDR Oberliga (East German League) that season using just 20 players, all of which had grown up in the Magdeburg area. Paul Haynes from Valencia, among others, has written in about Athletic Bilbao&apos;s &quot;cantera policy&quot; (meaning quarry or catchment area) whereby players are recruited from the local Basque country - which includes French Basque players such as Bixent Lizarazu. &quot;Athletic last won La Liga in 1983 and the league/cup double in 1984 exclusively with local players,&quot; says Paul. &quot;The Basque region in Spain is not that much bigger than the greater Glasgow area, and has a population of around two million people.&quot; And their success is not merely confined to the men&apos;s game, says Tim Treganza: &quot;The women&apos;s team have won four titles too, and that is not bad going!&quot; EMPTY STADIUMS (2) Last week&apos;s attempts to find the world&apos;s biggest, emptiest stadiums is a trivia gift that just keeps on giving. Not content with last week&apos;s outcome, Dougal Lamont makes another case for Queen&apos;s Park and Hampden. &quot;Until the 1970s Hampden&apos;s capacity was 135,000, so you would just have to find a game from that time when the crowd was below 15,000,&quot; says Dougal, determined to get the Spiders back to their rightful place atop our list. &quot;In the 1930s and 1940s the capacity was 150,000,&quot; he continues, &quot;although Queen&apos;s Park played in the top division for some of that time I&apos;m sure it would not be hard to find many home attendances of well below 30,000&quot; Perhaps not, but Alan Cooper, reckons he might even be able to beat that by taking us back to the 1920s when Ealing Association of the Southern Amateur League played at Wembley. &quot;When Ipswich played there in 1928, the attendance was 1,200,&quot; begins Alan. &quot;Ipswich, of course, have a mighty away following so presumably fewer people turned up for other Ealing matches that season. I&apos;ll let you do the maths, but if we cheat and allow White Horse Final capacity, Wembley might yet top your list.&quot; I&apos;m afraid we&apos;re not having that, Alan. Numbers must be based on how many fans can squeeze onto the terraces, not how many can squeeze onto the terraces and the pitch. 127,000 was Wembley&apos;s official capacity at the time, and 125,800 empty places would still mean Ealing Assocation betters the best from last week. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Watching Auxerre v Liverpool recently, I saw that Liverpool&apos;s sponsor was missing from their kit due to it being illegal in France to advertise alcohol,&quot; said Craig Mark Scully, way back in March 2003. &quot;I wondered if there were any other cases of British teams having to play minus their shirt sponsor in European competition?&quot; How long have you got, Craig? &quot;When Manchester United won the Cup Winners&apos; Cup final in Rotterdam in 1991 they did it without any sponsors on their shirts,&quot; says Paul McGrory, kicking off a bumper crop of answers. &quot;I think this was due to some clash with Uefa which would have meant Sharp paying extra money for this one match.&quot; However most shirt sponsorship problems arise because certain countries - particularly France and in Scandinavia - ban alcohol advertising. Ergo: when Rangers played Auxerre in the group stages of the Champions League, they were sponsored by Center Parks rather than McEwans lager. Meanwhile, Spurs were forced to remove the Holsten logo when they played Viking of Stavanger twice during the early 90s, according to Torgrim Svensen. However Ravi Hiranand remembers how some clubs found a way round this. &quot;Rather than bring in a different sponsor, Liverpool and Carlsberg instead decided to put the word &apos;Probably...&apos; on the front of the shirt (referring of course to Carlsberg catchphrase &apos;Probably the best lager in the world&apos;),&quot; he says. &quot;A sneaky way of getting past the law while still getting a sponsor&apos;s word in.&quot; But sometimes it&apos;s a case of political sensitivity, as Chelsea - sponsored by Arabian airline Emirates - decided when they visited Hapoel Tel Aviv. Finally, sponsors&apos; words don&apos;t always mean the same thing in your opposition&apos;s language, as Arsenal found out when they played in Italy a few years back. &quot;The Gunners had to wear their change strip which had Sega as the sponsor,&quot; says Pat Stafford. &quot;An Italian-speaking friend told me that &apos;Sega&apos; is a slang term for self-gratification.&quot; Spurs fans will have a field day with this.

That might still happen, but an inauspicious start to 2008 turned downright ugly this past weekend for Netanyahu when a new political scandal broke - with him at its epicentre. Israel TV Channel 10&apos;s Raviv Druker broke the story - not only of profligacy and embarrassing personal indulgence - but also a violation of the parliamentary ethical code and perhaps the illegal receipt of gifts. In August 2006, at the height of the Lebanon war, Netanyahu was in London as part of Israel&apos;s international PR effort. Druker revealed that the opposition leader&apos;s hotel bill for his six-day stay at the Connaught Hotel came to an impressive 131,000 shekels, or $38,000 - including a NIS 21,200 restaurant and bar tab, NIS 11,000 on theatre tickets, and NIS 2,500 at the hair salon (Jon Edwards take note - this was Mrs not Mr Netanyahu&apos;s expenditure). OK, so it looks bad - country at war, Bibi living it up. But it gets worse and legally sticky - the visit was not approved by the relevant parliamentary committee. And the bulk of the bill was paid for on the credit card of a private individual - one Joshua Rowe of Manchester, England. An investigation is now under consideration to check whether this contravenes the regulations guiding a Knesset member&apos;s receipt of gifts, especially given that Rowe has business interests in Israel (to be fair, the accusation of influence peddling seems very far-fetched judging by the facts and based on Rowe&apos;s own response). The problem for Israel&apos;s once and would-be leader is that this all follows a familiar pattern. Evidence has begun to emerge of other dubiously paid-for trips, including during Netanyahu&apos;s term as finance minister, and the Israeli public is being reminded of the avaricious side of the Netanyahus and in particular of first lady-in-waiting (and a figure scorned, with some justification, by the media) Sara Netanyahu. The story has presented the Israeli media with a welcome distraction from the rockets falling on the south and the dollar&apos;s falling in the Tel Aviv stock exchange. A new word has entered the Hebrew dictionary - &quot;Nehentanyahu&quot; - playing on the opposition leader&apos;s name and the Hebrew word for a decadent lifestyle. Israel&apos;s leading news commentator, Nahum Barnea, writing in the highest-circulation daily, Yediot Aharanot, described Netanyahu&apos;s behaviour as hedonistic (thought notably not corrupt). Going one better, his colleague Sima Kadmon, described Bibi&apos;s &quot;piggishness&quot;, while the competition Ma&apos;ariv newspaper&apos;s lead writer, Ben Caspit, spoke of a &quot;tragic character&quot;. Netanyahu punched back by filing a suit for slander against Channel 10 TV. This is a smart move. It makes Bibi sound confident, gives him and his surrogates a snappy sound-bite response and will take many, many months to be resolved. On the negative side, what it also means is that Netanyahu has failed, thus far at least, to provide any actual documentation to refute the accusation. The lawsuit is a poor second best to actually and speedily rebutting the story. So, what is the political fallout likely to be? 2008 started badly for the Likud leader. The final Winograd Report into the Lebanon war was published at the end of January, and not only did the political earthquake it caused measure very low on the scale, but Netanyahu himself was cast as partially responsible for mismanaging the opposition campaign. Olmert and his coalition survived, the PM&apos;s support numbers even climbed a little and elections receded from the horizon. In February Netanyahu&apos;s chief of staff, Naftali Bennettt - a successful recruit from the high-tech world - quit his job, amid accusations of interference by, you guessed it, Madame Netanyahu. It was the latest in a series of high profile resignations and put Sara firmly back in the spotlight. Now, in March, comes this latest scandal. Only a handful of Likud parliamentarians have jumped to their leader&apos;s defence (notably Yuval Steinitz and Gilad Erdan). Most of the Likud leadership and Knesset bloc are on the sidelines, assessing how this plays out politically and probably waiting for some new polling data. Netanyahu clearly has rivals who would love to unseat him - but they are well aware that a pugnacious Bibi, lambasting the biased liberal media, plays well with core Likud constituencies. This is what Netanyahu will be relying on - a combination of casting himself as the underdog versus the establishment that feeds historic Likud emotions of persecution (see McCain versus the New York Times after the Vicki Iseman allegations and how this played with conservative talk radio by way of comparison) plus a screw them, &apos;that-a-boy&apos; attitude, &apos;he&apos;s a rogue, but he&apos;s our rogue&apos; from the LIkud rank and file. Netanyahu will take a hit from the centrist voters who are so crucial to his electoral prospects, though. This is not to claim that the Israeli public is enthusiastic about the alternatives - or that either Kadima leader Ehud Olmert or Labour leader Ehud Barak can exactly run on the clean government, anti-corruption and frugality ticket. Olmert and Barak both have a rich record of police investigators against them and a no-less rich penchant for hedonism in their own lifestyles. This episode is also a reminder that for Israelis Netanyahu is very much a default option and not a popular choice with his approval numbers never exceeding 50%. The mood of the Israeli public toward ex-politicians, especially after the new Netanyahu revelations, seems to be one of a plague on all their houses. This latest episode is unlikely to be politically decisive in any way - though it is a useful cautionary tale. Israeli politics and public opinion remain fluid and Olmert&apos;s leadership has a resilience that should not be underestimated. And given the pretenders to the throne - Netanyahu and Barak - are both failed former prime ministers in their own right and are both more hostile to the peace process than the incumbent, that is no bad thing.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-19T18:00:00Z", "title": "Defining scandal", "sentences": ["The story has presented the Israeli media with a welcome distraction from the rockets falling on the south and the dollar&apos;s falling in the Tel Aviv stock exchange."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/19/definingscandal"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Science"], "article": "A mystery that has baffled the top minds in the esoteric mathematical field of symbolic dynamics for nearly four decades has recently been cracked - by a 63-year-old former security guard. Avraham Trakhtman, a mathematician who worked as a labourer after emigrating from Russia to Israel, has succeeded where dozens have failed, solving the elusive so-called road colouring problem. The conjecture essentially assumes that it is possible to create a &quot;universal map&quot; that would direct people to arrive at a certain destination, at the same time, regardless of their original location. Experts say this proposition, which seems to defy logic, could have applications in the fields of mapping and computer science. &quot;In math circles we talk about beautiful results - this is beautiful and it is unexpected. Even in layman&apos;s terms it is completely counterintuitive, but somehow it works,&quot; said Stuart Margolis, a colleague who recruited Trakhtman to Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv. He said the discovery was remarkable given Trakhtman&apos;s age and background. &quot;The first time I met him he was wearing a night watchman&apos;s uniform,&quot; he said. The road colouring problem was first posed in 1970 by Benjamin Weiss, an Israeli-American mathematician, and a colleague, Roy Adler, who worked at IBM. Weiss said he believed that given a finite number of roads, one should be able to draw up a map, coded in various colours, that would lead to a certain destination regardless of the point of origin. Originally from Yekaterinburg, Trakhtman was already an accomplished mathematician before moving to Israel in 1992, at the age of 48. Trakhtman said it took him a year to solve the problem. His solution will soon be published in the Israel Journal of Mathematics.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-21T00:04:19Z", "title": "Security guard solves 38-year-old maths poser", "sentences": ["Even in layman&apos;s terms it is completely counterintuitive, but somehow it works,&quot; said Stuart Margolis, a colleague who recruited Trakhtman to Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/21/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Sudan", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Africa"], "article": "&quot;Even though we&apos;re Muslim, the Islamic world has done nothing to protect us&quot;, said Yassin, a refugee whose tortured flight from Darfur finally brought him to Israel three years ago. He was one of the first Darfurians to make it into Israel across the border from Egypt, and has dedicated his life to helping hundreds of his fellow countrymen who have made the same perilous journey. Yassin, a genial 30-year-old former architect, is now director of Bnei Darfur [Sons of Darfur], an organisation which assists Sudanese refugees to integrate into Israeli society, and which last week was finally granted non-profit status by the Israeli government. Sitting in his office in downtown Tel Aviv, Yassin painted a harrowing picture of the way in which Darfurian refugees are mistreated by the uncaring and unsympathetic authorities in Egypt, which is the first port of call of many fleeing the violence in Sudan. Darfuri children are scared to set foot outside in Egypt for fear of attack, Yassin said, citing the slaying of dozens of refugees after a protest outside the UNHCR headquarters in 2005. &quot;It&apos;s not that Egypt doesn&apos;t look after refugees in general,&quot; he said, &quot;after all, they treat the Somalians very well. However, when it comes to us, they are different. It&apos;s racism [that motivates the Egyptian mistreatment].&quot; It doesn&apos;t help that the Darfurians are accusing fellow Muslims of genocide, said Yassin, noting that the Muslim states who support the Sudanese government in turn claim that the refugees are collaborating with enemy states in the West. &quot;All of the Arab countries support the government of Sudan - our problem is with the Arab League,&quot; Yassin stated with a shake of his head at his people&apos;s plight. Having watched most of his family slaughtered in a militia attack on his village, he fled the region hoping to find shelter in Egypt, but was soon forced to move on. After the cold and often violent reception the refugees received at the hands of the Egyptians, Yassin decided that things couldn&apos;t be worse on the Israeli side of the border - despite the anti-Israeli indoctrination he&apos;d been spoon-fed when growing up in Sudan. &quot;The government controlled all of the media back home,&quot; he said. &quot;The television stations, the radio, the newspapers... and all of them were very hostile towards Israel. They described it as an enemy state full of killers, and the cause of all of the world&apos;s problems.&quot; He smiled at the irony of Israel turning out to be the first country where he and his fellow refugees could finally find sanctuary - although it was hardly plain sailing at first. &quot;When the army picked me up, I spent five days on their base in a tiny room with five Egyptian men. The conditions were awful, and one of the judges was very cruel, threatening to deport me back to Egypt. She told me that I was I wasn&apos;t welcome in Israel because I was from an &apos;enemy country&apos; - but in the end I was transferred to a larger prison in the south.&quot; He spent 14 months in jail, where he banded together with other Darfurian refugees and founded an informal support group to assist one another, teaching English, Arabic and Hebrew to those who required educating. After a few months, the Israeli press started picking up the story of the refugee crisis, and soon several NGOs and welfare organisations began campaigning for their release. The UN got involved, and eventually many of the refugees were let out of jail and sent to work on local kibbutzim. However, once free they faced large-scale exploitation by employers who took advantage of their lack of proper permits and rights, forcing them to work for a pittance and in dreadful conditions. Again, intervention from the UN and local NGOs caused a change of heart on the part of the government, who granted 600 of the 750 refugees with &apos;A5&apos; temporary residency status, with the remainder receiving protection as asylum seekers. And the rest is recent history. Yassin and his friends formed Bnei Darfur, and have been stunningly successful in their mission to create a self-sufficient community &quot;that isn&apos;t a drain on Israeli society&quot;. Every one of the refugees has a job, a house, and access to medical care - &quot;the only ones without jobs are the ones who&apos;ve just arrived, and we soon take care of them&quot;, he said. The children have been found places at Israeli schools, where they learn Hebrew and befriend their locally-born peers, and the future appears bright for those who have managed to make it into Israel. Many Israelis took up the Darfurians&apos; cause on the basis that Jews have been denied refuge by indifferent countries throughout history, and that Israeli Jews should remember their own troubled past when dealing with the victims of today. However, whilst the way in which Israel (eventually) received the refugees is to be admired, there is of course the accusation of double standards to be dealt with regarding Palestinian refugees being denied the chance to relocate to the Promised Land. But the unresolved issue of the Palestinian right of return is not something Yassin wished to be drawn on. As far as he&apos;s concerned, Israel has provided for his people in a way that no Arab country would - and for that he&apos;s eternally grateful. And in terms of Israel&apos;s image in the eyes of the refugees as well as the outside world, accepting the unwanted Darfurians was both an astute and an admirable move to make.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-24T11:00:00Z", "title": "An unlikely refuge", "sentences": ["Sitting in his office in downtown Tel Aviv, Yassin painted a harrowing picture of the way in which Darfurian refugees are mistreated by the uncaring and unsympathetic authorities in Egypt, which is the first port of call of many fleeing the violence in Sudan."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/24/darfurrefugeesinisrael"}, {"tags": ["Culture", "Art and design"], "article": "The architect Tom Kay, who has died aged 72, was a mesmerising storyteller whose life was a great story too. He was an activist - his last professional-political project was in his birthplace, Palestine; he was an adventurer who loved motorbikes and deserts and foaming rivers; he was a conscientious objector who refused to do national service in the late 1950s; and he took part, with Pat Arrowsmith, in anti-nuclear action, sitting in a concrete mixer in Swaffham, Norfolk, to oppose the building of a Thor missile base. Tom was also fastidious, clever and humane. His buildings maximised illumination and habitation, and his discipline brought architectural students to peer into the nooks of his own home in Camden Town, north London. His mother Ellen, a professional photographer, was German-Jewish and his father, Leo Knopfelmacher, Czechoslovak-Jewish. Both were Communist party members, and in the mid-1930s they visited Palestine, where Tom was born. But his father was a gambler who repeatedly sold off everything the family owned. After he sold her cameras, in early 1936 his mother left her &quot;intelligent, funny, loveable&quot; - and impossible - husband, and took Tom and his older brother Peter to London, where she had relatives. When the second world war broke out, Ellen joined the Land Army, but in 1940 she made the hazardous Atlantic crossing with her children. It took them to Jamaica before they eventually settled in Montreal. Tom was 15 before he realised he was a Jew. In 1949 the family returned to England and settled in Sussex, where he briefly attended Midhurst grammar school. Their butcher could not manage the family name of &quot;Knopfelmacher&quot;, so Kay replaced it. From the early 1950s to 1957 Tom studied architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now part of Westminster University). He then worked briefly for Erno Goldfinger - who called him a &quot;bloody little anarchist&quot; - and the London county council housing department. Having refused to do national service, Tom was assigned to work in the University College hospital basement, but after six months he set off for India. In 1959, he went to Israel, where family contacts helped him land a temporary job which left him effectively designing the El Al building in Tel Aviv (then the tallest building in Israel). He spent two years &quot;keeping one day ahead of the contractor&quot; - and learned a lot about concrete and building sites. Back in London in 1961, he worked for Austin-Smith - and learned how to run an architect&apos;s office. Then, in 1964, he set up on his own. A year later he met his wife Adah Nathani; they stayed together for 40 years, becoming part of a nationwide movement of professionals who were reinventing housing politics. In the early 1970s they helped form Camden Housing Action and the Camden law centres. Tom helped tenants who took on their landlords, and became a loved local character. As an architect, he never wanted to develop a house style; each project scrupulously addressed the individual needs of brief, site and context. His output was not large, but it was diverse, ranging from houses and interiors to offices, studios and light industry. The first of his buildings to receive general acclaim was the house he built in 1971 for himself and his family in Murray Mews, Camden, a remarkable exercise in compression and sensitivity. On a very small site, he managed to insert three bedrooms, two terraces, a living area, dining room, kitchen, two bathrooms, a garage, garden, studio/office and a couple of galleries. All this is hidden behind a wall of secondhand London bricks, chosen to maintain the traditional mews atmosphere. After coming in through the virtually blank brick wall, it is astonishing to find the house full of natural light, often pouring from above. Tom had argued furiously against Camden council&apos;s decision to widen the mews by forcing all new buildings to be set three metres back from the street line, and in the late 1960s he forced the Ministry of Housing to overturn the council&apos;s decision. All his work showed his tenacity, understanding of materials and light, and his ability to compress a complicated programme into an enjoyable piece of city. This was evident, on a larger scale, in the late 1970s with his work on the Alexandra Road estate, north Camden. Houses and flats were placed above industrial workshops, becoming one of the most successful parts of the borouogh&apos;s most impressive housing development. Tom&apos;s ingenuity in combining industrial and domestic scales is exemplified in a pharmaceutical laboratory he designed between 1983 and 1985 in a back garden in Hackney, north London. He balanced his practice by teaching, at the Royal College of Art from the mid-1960s into the 80s, and the Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture in the 1990s. In 2001 he closed his practice, and, with Adah, embarked on the last exhilarating phase of their life together. He returned to Palestine to teach, where he was visiting professor (2002-05) at Birzeit University in Ramallah. He then worked with the Palestinian Centre for Architectural Conservation, Riwaq. While in Ramallah, Tom documented, in writing, photographs and sketches, what he witnessed. His flimsy frame, camera poised, would not yield to Israeli soldiers. His reports to the western press and on the world wide web were some of the first to show Israel&apos;s wanton destructiveness, and its use of planning and architecture to control the Palestinians. He is survived by Adah and sons Finn and Leo. \u00b7 Tom Kay, architect and teacher, born October 17 1935; died December 9 2007", "publicationDate": "2008-03-27T00:12:20Z", "title": "Obituary: Tom Kay", "sentences": ["In 1959, he went to Israel, where family contacts helped him land a temporary job which left him effectively designing the El Al building in Tel Aviv (then the tallest building in Israel)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/27/2"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The renewal of the negotiations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority, following their suspension in the wake of Israeli incursions into Gaza, remind us how close to the brink of some kind of abyss the peace process is. It forces us to ask what the alternatives are if there are no negotiations. If the PNA fails in the West Bank, will Palestinian support for the resistance lead to a Hamas-like takeover of a walled-in West Bank? Will the future lead to rockets being fired from Tulkarm onto Tel Aviv? In this context, some analysts and planners are looking for new ways to envision a future which goes beyond the fruitless horse-trading that has characterised the post-Annapolis round of negotiations between the Israeli government and the PA, and one which avoids a collapse of the PA itself. One of the currents in the debate is that a binational state comprising both Israeli and Palestinian citizens may not be so far removed from a viable two-state solution that has been the framework for the current negotiations. For decades the idea of a binational state has been dismissed by politicians and the wider Israeli and Palestinian public as the crazy imaginings of naive idealists - even if held by such luminaries as Martin Buber. Indeed, most Israelis and Zionists have gone so far to characterise it as a code for the extinction of Israel and accuse its supporters of anti-semitism. Similarly, some Palestinian nationalists have seen it as defeatist and a sign of complicity in the defeat and dispossession of the Palestinians that occurred in 1948. However, since the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993 between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Israeli government, significant changes in the underpinning of the two-state solution have taken place - the ramifications of which are only now more clearly seen. For all its failings, the Oslo accords contained within it the crucial recognition by the Israelis of the right of the Palestinians to at least a part of the land of Palestine. The importance of this was not immediately apparent, but it precipitated, nevertheless, a debate over the future of Zionism. If the whole of Palestine was not the birthright of Zionism, where did you draw the line? Was it the areas suggested by the Israeli government at the Camp David summit in 2000, or the armistice lines as they stood in 1949? If Palestinians exist as a people and a nation are they not entitled to equal rights as Israeli Jews? How does one reconcile the privileging of Jewishness with this entitlement to equality? In short, can Israel be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time? This internal reflection on the future of Zionism and Israel in the wake of a peace agreement has been compounded by the work of analysts, policy-makers and academics in the various behind-the-scenes negotiations. In putting substance onto various proposed frameworks for peace, in spelling out the fine print of any agreement, there is a growing realisation that if the agreement is to avoid the total separation suggested by the huge wall running through the West Bank and the fences surrounding Gaza, as well as the alienation of the vast majority of Palestinian refugees, a high degree of cooperation will be required. Such comprehensive cooperation points to arrangements that are much more than your usual bilateral treaty between two states. It is already accepted that the two-state solution will consist of a range of agreements that extend way beyond intelligence and security cooperation to encompass the economy and trade, the environment, the extraction of water, regional urban planning, tourism, immigration and so on. And already there are agreements in place for a single economic zone for Israel and Palestine, for a customs union, for a unified citizen database and for the sharing of water, which point to a merging of the two states at some fundamental levels. In essence, what is being discussed is a sort of &quot;two-state plus&quot;, which on further analysis looks remarkably close to some variants of the one state solution. Take, for example, how the two-state solution will work for the capital city of both states, Jerusalem. If one is to avoid dividing the city into two parts, if one is to maintain the mobility of the residents and their freedom to shop, work and worship in different parts of the city, if one is to ensure that visitors and pilgrims have access to its different sites (remember that the core economic asset of Jerusalem is its visitors) then arrangements have to be devised which satisfy both the security and economic needs of the city. Some sort of &quot;supranational&quot; body, such as a regional planning commission or a grand municipal council, comprising representatives of the Palestinian and Israeli municipality and of the national ministries, will need to be set up to cooperate over flows of visitors, infrastructural development, environmental hazards and architectural design. Even if, in an act of desperate last resort to achieve some agreement, the city is divided by walls and barriers, there will still need to be cooperation across the walls to ensure that the city continues to function smoothly with regard to waste disposal, water supply and access to the holy sites. What has not been taken on board by the wider public is that a binational state does not mean the eradication of the nations involved. There are a variety of precedents and models for political cooperation that show how national interests can be protected. These models comprise structures which range from the confederal model (two or more entities with a kind of steering committee) a federal model (two or more entities with certain powers allocated to a central body) to a consociational model (a single state structure with powers allocated to the two or more entities according to agreed criteria, such as size of population). Where these models might be relevant to the current situation in the Middle East is that they provide both concrete ideas for how the degree of cooperation between the two entities can be achieved and also a benchmark for determining the equity of any agreement. The argument being made is that the binationalism, or the one state solution, is simply the two-state solution that works well and works fairly.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-31T08:00:00Z", "title": "One state or two?", "sentences": ["Will the future lead to rockets being fired from Tulkarm onto Tel Aviv?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/31/onestateortwo"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea", "Fenerbah\u00e7e", "Nicolas Anelka"], "article": "Nicolas Anelka and Avram Grant were clearly touched by the welcome they received on Monday night, after landing on the Asian side of Istanbul at Sabiha Gokcen airport.

Glenny traces the modern spread of transnational crime to the break-up of the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc in the late Eighties and early Nineties and the simultaneous deregulation of global markets. But his is not some crude ideological thesis, much less one that laments the passing of Cold War divisions and certainties. For it was the Soviet bloc that incubated such favourable conditions for the development of criminal motivation and expertise. In Bulgaria, for example, the secret service played a key role in arms and drugs smuggling during the communist period. According to Glenny, 80 per cent of western Europe&apos;s heroin went through the sticky hands of the Bulgarian DS (equivalent of the KGB). At the same time, the communist system created a management class steeped in corrupt practices with a contempt for civic responsibility. When communism fell, there were suddenly thousands of unemployed cops and spooks in Bulgaria with first-hand experience of international crime. And there were also a great many wrestlers and weightlifters, pumped-up on state-issued steroids, who would make for ideal muscle in the protection rackets that quickly sprung up. Drugs, prostitution, car theft, money laundering and extortion followed on an industrial scale. And soon Bulgarians were in competition with Kazakhs, Georgians, Moldovans, Yugoslavs and, of course, Russians, all seeking turf in the new gangsterland of Eastern Europe. Glenny is particularly strong on the bizarre economic liberalisation that took place under Boris Yeltsin and which produced the bloody reign of the oligarchs in the early Nineties. All price restrictions were removed by government, except those of Russia&apos;s natural resources: oil, gas, diamonds and metals. Overnight, a vast number of Russians were impoverished, while a tiny minority was able to buy up vital commodities at up to 40 times less than their global market price. &apos;This process of enrichment,&apos; Glenny writes, &apos;was quite simply the grandest larceny in history and stands no historical comparison.&apos; In turn the oligarchs required protection, and jailbirds and former KGB agents alike moved into the lucrative if deadly business of the &apos;kryshy&apos; protection rackets, or &apos;armed entrepreneurs&apos;. After the failure of the Soviet Union, in which the law was subordinate to shifting party requirements, Russia effectively privatised crime. It fell to Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB agent, to bring it back under state control, or, more accurately, guidance. As Glenny illustrates, Putin also supported the controversial regime of Leonid Kuchma that was temporarily unseated in the Orange revolution in Ukraine. Nowadays, Glenny quotes a US official as saying, a Russian businessman is as likely to be a member of the intelligence services as a criminal cartel, and quite possibly to be part of both. The effects of the Russian organised crime boom have been experienced as far afield as Tel Aviv and New York, and all parts of Europe. In this reading, the East is little more than an opportunistic supplier to the West&apos;s insatiable demand. &apos;Organised crime is such a rewarding industry,&apos; writes Glenny, &apos; ... because ordinary Western Europeans spend an ever burgeoning amount of their spare time and money sleeping with prostitutes; smoking untaxed cigarettes; sticking \u20ac50 notes up their noses; employing illegal untaxed immigrant labour on subsistence wages; admiring ivory and sitting on teak; or purchasing the liver and kidneys of the desperately poor in the developing world.&apos; This is undoubtedly true, up to a point, but it&apos;s a truth that is based on a more fundamental reality: when goods and activities are illegal, it&apos;s the criminals who make the profits. Glenny works hard to marry this timeless law to the contemporary globalised scene, in particular to the liberalised movement of capital. The problem is not that the relationship doesn&apos;t exist, but that it doesn&apos;t conform to a narrative-friendly pattern. Thus the story begins to fragment into an episodic summary of crime enterprises around the world - hence the title&apos;s global-franchise reference. Some of the characters, like one Semyon Mogilevich, one of Russia&apos;s leading criminals, come across like Keyser Soze from The Usual Suspects, an elusive, half-legendary incarnation of evil. Others barely register amid the multinational cast of walk-on scoundrels and psychopaths that appear in a series of decreasingly shocking anecdotes. The scene shifts from Russia to the Middle East, India on to Colombia and South Africa, but with each jump the specific causes of crime become less well defined until all that&apos;s manifest is a general sense that a combination of unstable states and sought-after natural resources attract some highly unprincipled individuals. This is in no way a reflection on Glenny&apos;s research, which is extensive. Rather the scale of the subject mitigates against the kind of plotting, themes and characters that lend non-fiction, at its best, a satisfying shape. Even so it is a substantial book that features, among a gallery of extraordinary crime scenes, some of the most compelling analyses of the Balkan tragedy and the creation of the post-Soviet economy. Glenny is a fine reporter and he&apos;s not afraid to put himself in threatening situations - one imagines his name is conspicuously absent from the Christmas-card list of the world&apos;s major criminals. If the writing is occasionally a little colourful, the conclusions are mostly sober and sound. Glenny correctly identifies the contradiction of the Wars on Drugs and Terror, in which the illicit trade created by the former sustains the enemy in the latter. &apos;If the UN is right and drugs account for 70 per cent of organised criminal activity,&apos; argues Glenny, &apos;then the legalisation of drugs would administer by far the deadliest blow possible against transnational organised criminal networks.&apos; His other, still less controversial point, is that the international financial markets are in need of greater regulation. Their current abuse Glenny blames on a mixture of aggressive American liberalism, European incompetence, Russian cynicism and Sino-Indian ambition. It&apos;s important to remember that, however unattractive those Bulgarians in the photo may appear, capitalism and criminality are not the same thing. But to the extent that they coincide, it&apos;s capitalism that needs to reform. The alternative is to leave it to the criminals. And in the matter of self-control, as this book so convincingly shows, their record is not encouraging.

For the first we head to the Wolds and Sincil Bank, where both Scott Walden and Harry Winckworth have highlighted the case of Lincoln City&apos;s Grant Brown. Harry picks up the tale on a drab Tuesday night in March 1998 when Swansea City were the visitors. &quot;It proved to be John Beck&apos;s last game in charge of Lincoln,&quot; he writes. &quot;To illustrate how Beck was losing the plot, his original line-up that night contained four centre-backs, two full-backs, two nut-job midfielders and two strikers. After just two minutes of play, Beck replaced the club captain and Imps record-appearance holder Grant Brown - a central defender - with the enigmatic and speedy midfielder Steve Brown, to the cat-calls of a bemused home support. &quot;I remember Beck claiming afterwards that he&apos;d been expecting Swansea to play three up front. However, the Swans lined up with a five-man midfield, much to Beck&apos;s surprise, so rather than push one of our six defenders higher up the pitch, he instead made the earliest tactical substitution I ever recall seeing.&quot; Scott has a more conspiracist explanation, suggesting rather tentatively that the early substitution may have been to embarrass the defender after a previous poor performance. Andreas Marienborg, though, can just about trump that. &quot;In 2006 Bryne played Tromsdalen in the Norwegian First Division,&quot; he writes. &quot;Bryne were going through a horrible period injury-wise and had almost no defenders available in their senior squad. But because of Norwegian regulations they weren&apos;t allowed to play their unlicensed under-18 players from start, though they were allowed to put them on the bench. So the injured striker H\u00e5vard Sakariassen started as a central defender, only to be substituted after one minute so that young Oddgeir Salte could get his debut.&quot; Know of anyone else hauled off in the opening minutes? Why not drop us a line at knowledge@theguardian.com MASTERS OF THE MANAGERIAL MERRY-GO-ROUND &quot;Gordon Igesund has coached four teams to a Premier League title in South Africa (Manning Rangers 1996-97, Orlando Pirates 2000-01, Santos 2001-02 and Mamelodi Sundowns 2006-07),&quot; noted James Lloyd last week. &quot;Has any other manager coached as many different teams to the title in the same league?&quot; We&apos;ve dug out three notables that can equal Igesund&apos;s record, James. The first of these, as revealed by Eran Rabl, is the current manager of the Israeli national side, Dror Kashtan. Kashtan won the 1982-83 Israeli title with Hapoel Kfar Saba before moving to Beitar Jerusalem, where he added two more league titles to his CV in 1986-87 and 1992-93. For the 1995-96 season Kashtan moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, subsequently winning another title, before moving back to Beitar to complete a hat-trick of league trophies there in the 1997-98 season. The fourth and final team he took to a league title was Hapoel Tel Aviv in 1999-00. Sean DeLoughry has written in to sing the praises of Jim McLaughlin. McLaughlin won the FAI League of Ireland a total of eight times with four different clubs. He started his managerial career as player-manager at Dundalk, winning three titles in 1975-76, 1978-79 and 1981-82. From there, he moved to Shamrock Rovers and in the 1983-84 season he won the first of three consecutive league titles. Another League of Ireland trophy followed with Derry City in 1988-89 and he was joint-manager of Shelbourne in 1991-92 when they won the league. He also led two different teams to First Division titles, Drogheda and Derry, and has a host of cup medals in his glittering trophy cabinet. Last, and certainly not least, is the former Brazil manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo. Luis Garcia-Carreras points out that Luxemburgo won Brazilian league titles with Palmeiras in 1993 and 1994, Corinthians in 1998, Cruzeiro in 2003 and Santos in 2004, before heading off for a brief and rather unsuccessful spell with Real Madrid. G14 JOURNEYMEN &quot;Ronaldo has played for five of the G14 clubs (PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Internazionale, Real Madrid and AC Milan),&quot; wrote Hamzah Khan last week. &quot;Has anyone else played for more?&quot; Despite plenty of trawling for more high-end journeymen to add to the list, no one could better Hamzah&apos;s initial effort. Many of you were able to equal it, however. Numerous emails flagged up the worthy records of Edgar Davids and Patrick Kluivert, two graduates of the Ajax finishing school. Davids is currently back where he began, having put in stints at Milan, Juventus, Barca and Inter, while Kluivert has also had spells with Milan, Barca, Valencia and PSV. &quot;A great testament to two players who have shown talent and longevity while playing for such big and historic clubs - and Newcastle and Tottenham,&quot; observes David Joiner. In with a shout of breaking the record is Nicolas Anelka, who played for Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Liverpool before the age of 24. Chelsea, of course, aren&apos;t a member of the G14, but with Le Sulk&apos;s itinerant career history he still has hope. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Cardiff City is famously the only non-English club to win the FA Cup, back in 1927,&quot; said David Tudor back in October 2004. &quot;Are there any other instances of &apos;foreign&apos; clubs winning domestic cup or league competitions?&quot; There certainly are David. Even if the Bluebirds&apos; FA Cup winning feat is unequalled in this country (Scottish side Queen&apos;s Park were runners-up in 1884 and 1885), John Morrow points out that they&apos;re not the only Welsh side to win trophies in English football. Step forward Swansea City (Division Three South champions 1924-25, 1948-49) and Wrexham (Division Three champions 1977-78 and LDV Trophy winners 2004-05). &quot;Before the advent of the League of Wales, English clubs routinely won the Welsh Cup,&quot; he adds. &quot;Oswestry United were the first in 1884, followed by Shrewsbury Town, Telford United (as Wellington), Chester City, Bristol City, Crewe Alexandra, Tranmere Rovers, South Liverpool and Hereford United.&quot; Moving further afield, Tristan Browning was one of several readers to point out a well-known French example. &quot;Possibly tenuous, but Monaco have won seven leagues, five cups and one league cup.&quot; Not tenuous at all, Tristan: the team from the principality even did the league and cup double in 1962-63. Elsewhere, Claudio Gameiro has delved into the geopolitical history of the Third Reich. &quot;After the Anschluss, Rapid Vienna (1938) and First Vienna (1943) both won the German Cup, and Rapid won the German league in 1941.&quot; Duncan Steel has cast a lazy eye over the set-up of Irish football for another case in point. &quot;Derry City of Derry, Northern Ireland, have played for 20 years in the Republic&apos;s League of Ireland, but I&apos;m damned if I know whether they&apos;ve ever won anything,&quot; says Duncan. Well, let us fill in the blanks: they&apos;ve won the FAI Premier Division twice, in 1988-89 and 1996-97, the Cup in 1988-89, 1994-95 and 2001-02, and the League Cup in 1988-89, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1994-95, 1999-00 and 2004-05, as well as one First Division championship, since joining the League of Ireland in 1985. And then there&apos;s Belfast outfit Alton United, FAI Cup winners in 1923. Last but not least, back to John Morrow. &quot;English outfit Berwick Rangers are worthy of a mention, having won the 1978-79 Scottish Second Division crown,&quot; he observes. &quot;FC Vaduz have won promotions in Swiss football (1956, 1960, 1978, 1990), despite being based in Liechtenstein, while San Marino Calcio were promoted from Serie C2 to Serie C1 last season, despite not being Italian and despite San Marino having its own league - unlike Liechtenstein.&quot; Phew.

We were a very close Jewish family and she was the linchpin. Women are a fairly necessary part of a man&apos;s life. My dad still lives up the road, in Wembley, north London, and I&apos;m teaching him to cook and generally cope without her. I&apos;m just pleased we were together when she died. I sang David Bowie&apos;s &apos;Wild is the Wind&apos; and stroked her belly as she went. It was our favourite Bowie song. I think that&apos;s probably as lovely as death gets. Oddly enough, my first celebrity crush wasn&apos;t a girl. It was David Bowie. I used to go to this fish shop in Nottingham when I was an art student there. It had an orange wall, like the colour on the Low cover. I&apos;d sit for hours in profile at this table waiting for a girl to come in, buy a bag of chips and think I was Bowie. He&apos;s a beautiful man. I loved him. Then there was Linda Green. I took her to see Grease on our first date. I had braces and I could feel a snog coming so I ran to the loo and never came back. To this day, I have only ever seen the first 10 minutes of Grease. I was terrified she was going to rip her tongue. She got into Queen so I went off her pretty quickly. My twin sister is an hour older and fantastic. We used to dress up as geisha girls and go to taboo clubs because we looked the same, lots of make-up and long hair. Then I started shaving. But she got to snog Bowie. I couldn&apos;t believe it. We&apos;d got tickets for a concert in 1982. I was ill so I gave mine to her boyfriend. After the show they followed his car, shouting his name down the street. He walked over, sat on the car bonnet and French-kissed her. She sat by the phone for six months waiting for him to call. It completely screwed her up - she was about to do her A-levels and she went mad. All in all, a bad time for us both. Luckily, he didn&apos;t ring otherwise she wouldn&apos;t have met her husband and we wouldn&apos;t be talking. I&apos;m married now, so sis is off the hook. I fell for my wife after seeing her being thrown out of a dining room by her father for being drunk and disorderly. We were 18 and both living in a Jewish kibbutz in Tel Aviv. I started leaving paintings and twigs outside her door like a daft teenager and, one day, I came back and found a little soldier, suited and booted, in my cupboard. She had run away from the army. We got married and came back to England. Nine years later, after our first kid was born, we split up. Then, seven years ago, we got back together. The split was very acrimonious but during the gap we got our careers together. We never divorced; I don&apos;t think we ever stopped loving each other. We&apos;re very happy now. I love the idea of love. I went to Venice as a teenager and took a copy of The Magus. I spent the whole time lying around looking ridiculous, as if I was in the book. I don&apos;t see a divide between life and art. When I started doing my Dennis Pennis character on TV, it felt like an extension of my life. He was my psychic bin and, as I was having some problems in Tel Aviv, it seemed like a good idea. But I hated doing it. Now it&apos;s family, sanity and work in that order, especially since my mum&apos;s gone. My wife&apos;s mum&apos;s a widow and still lives in a kibbutz in Israel&apos;s Negev Desert. She has a golf caddie cart for visiting her husband&apos;s grave and is always up there, rain or shine, cleaning it. I think that says so much that, after death, the women of the kibbutz will always make the stones of their loved ones look respectable.

The world-famous communes, which hosted a generation of volunteers from singer Simon Le Bon to actor Bob Hoskins, are to launch their first advertising campaign in a decade.  The campaign, focusing on 140 sites in the north and south of the country, aims to tout the benefits of kibbutz living for a hip, new eco-aware generation. Re-branded for the 21st century, socialist ideals are downgraded in favour of environmental ethics and organic farming replaces conventional agriculture.  Israel believes its new-look kibbutzim can again entice a new wave of Westerners to follow in the footsteps of Sacha Baron Cohen, the comedian behind Ali G and Borat, and US actress Sigourney Weaver.  British actor Paul Kaye volunteered in a Tel Aviv commune in the Eighties. He told The Observer that the experience changed his life and was seen as &apos;a great escape from what was going on politically in Britain at the time&apos;.  The advertising campaign is scheduled to launch this summer. One aspect of the campaign will be contacting former high-profile volunteers to endorse the make-over. As the Zionist ideals of collectivism and egalitarianism fell from favour during the Eighties, popularity waned. By the turn-of-the-century, more than half of Israel&apos;s 257 collective farms were bankrupt. Now Israel believes the relaunch of kibbutzim can recapture their popularity. Against a backdrop of continuing violence between Hamas and Israeli forces last week, the Tel Aviv-based Kibbutz Movement said the move to re-brand the communes was vital.  Spokesman Aviv Leshem said: &apos;We want the world to see the other, peaceful side of Israel. The modifications to kibbutzim are a phenomenon of the last three years.&apos;  Others describe the development of the new kibbutzim as a confirmation of a changing world. Their reinvention will concentrate mainly on the communes&apos; eco-credentials in an attempt to add ballast to Israel&apos;s environmental reputation. All new construction will be energy-efficient, using solar power and recycling water where possible. Plans to phase out conventional agriculture and replace it with organic farming are advanced, a move welcomed by the Negev Desert kibbutz, which is suffering from the effects of climate change. Another nod to the modern age includes the installation of wi-fi internet access.  Yet controversially, given the kibbutzim&apos;s once self-sufficient, bohemian ideals, the main source of income will no longer be agriculture. Leshem said only 15 per cent of the income would come from farming, with industries such as the production of plastics more prominent.  Meanwhile, 40 per cent of residents now work outside the commune. Such trends have been interpreted as a shift from communal living to individual fulfilment.  The Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, hopes former residents, including celebrities, will help to publicise the communes to a world audience. Some will view it as a cynical attempt to gloss over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  But hopes remain that the fervent re-branding will none the less encourage volunteers and show Israel&apos;s attempt to accommodate this decade&apos;s wave of change.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-13T12:04:02Z", "title": "Israel re-brands kibbutzim to lure eco-aware generation", "sentences": ["British actor Paul Kaye volunteered in a Tel Aviv commune in the Eighties.", "Against a backdrop of continuing violence between Hamas and Israeli forces last week, the Tel Aviv-based Kibbutz Movement said the move to re-brand the communes was vital."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/13/israelandthepalestinians.kibbutz"}, {"tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "The healing power of art ... Graffiti artist Banksy&apos;s work on the Israeli West Bank Barrier, Ramallah, Palestine. Photograph: PA Theatre - the interface between live people on a stage performing as somebody else, and live people in the auditorium lifted out of themselves - has from its origins been a way of understanding the Other. It also allows us to identify with people we have turned into victims. What Euripides began in his depiction of the Trojan women, prisoners of war imprisoned and humiliated by his fellow Athenians, is still being attempted by theatre today. A striking case in point is the recent news that a leading Israeli actor, whose son was killed while serving in the army, is appearing as a Palestinian peace activist whose daughter was killed by Israeli border police.  Shlomo Vishinsky, a star of Tel Aviv&apos;s Cameri Theatre and one of its most popular comic actors, is performing in Don&apos;t Look HangDog Around Here, a one-man play about Bassam Aramin, a former Palestinian militant. His 10-year-old daughter Abir, walking back from school, was killed last January by a bullet in the head, allegedly fired from a border police unit. Shlomo&apos;s 20-year-old son Lior, detonating weapons-smuggling tunnels in the Gaza Strip, was blown to pieces in 2004. After serving seven years in Israeli jails, Bassam came out convinced that armed struggle was not the solution, and became co-founder of the pioneering Israeli/Palestinian peace group, Combatants for Peace. After Aramin&apos;s daughter&apos;s death, one of the Israeli members of Combatants for Peace, Idan Meir, wrote the play. More than just another &quot;verbatim drama&quot;, Don&apos;t Look HangDog Around Here is emblematic in a number of ways. Not only does it marshal theatre&apos;s powers of empathy, it treads the troubling line between art and direct personal testimony: in real life, the performer is afflicted by the situation he describes. Yet it remains drama, not drama therapy - though this can be admirable in itself, as the recent staging of Grimm&apos;s fairy tales in a Gloucestershire youth camp by a group of Israeli and Arab kids showed. Vishinsky&apos;s performance is theatre, aiming at what the Greeks called catharsis, the purging of emotions by their theatrical distillation and release - in this case, purgation of the pity and fear that dominate so many lives in the Middle East. In drama therapy, the benefit is felt by the participants; in drama, by the audience and, through the way a live theatre event radiates through the culture, by the community at large. Meanwhile, at the Cameri Theatre of Tel Aviv, a new play reflects the intertwined destinies of two peoples fighting over a contested land. Boaz Gaon&apos;s Return to Haifa stages the confrontation between the natural mother and the adoptive mother of a Palestinian child. The child&apos;s biological mother, who involuntarily abandoned her baby son when she fled from Haifa during the Jewish-Arab war in 1948, comes to reclaim her child from the woman who has brought him up as a Jew - and who is herself a refugee from the Holocaust. The fact that this play should be adapted by an Israeli playwright from a novella by Ghassan Kanafani, widely regarded as the 20th century&apos;s greatest Palestinian writer, and performed by a mixed Arab/Jewish cast, makes it yet another step in theatre&apos;s ability to transcend the divisions and belligerent certainties of the current conflict. No one would claim that either of these pieces of theatre will halt the killing.

Hence they often fail to find the audience they deserve unless their innate &quot;controversy&quot; gives them the oxygen of publicity. Still, folks, musn&apos;t stand in the way of progress. Devoid of this, Age of Terror was an enthralling recounting of the 1976 hijacking of the Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris that German and Palestinian terrorists diverted to Entebbe airport in Uganda. It attracted 1.1 million viewers, last in its slot among terrestrial networks.  Journalist Peter Taylor surveys 40 years of terrorism. Photograph: BBC Taylor was simply great. Sam Wollaston in the Guardian agreed.  &quot;Taylor talks to everyone involved: hostages, friends and family of the hijackers, Israeli soldiers and pilots. What comes out is a complete picture, the full story. It&apos;s one that has been told many times before, but never so thoroughly. Proper journalism.&quot;    Wollaston quibbled with the use of reconstructions in the documentary, but they were a minor part of the programme that did not detract from the interviews Taylor did with the hostages and Israeli strike force. James Walton in The Daily Telegraph was another fan.  When Peter Taylor started the first episode of Age of Terror (BBC2) with a promise to tell us the history of terrorism over the past 40 years, it was hard to imagine anybody better-placed to fulfil it. After all, his previous work includes several magisterial documentaries on Northern Ireland, and 2005&apos;s The New al-Qa&apos;eda, which gave a calm but thorough kicking to Adam Curtis&apos;s theory in The Power of Nightmares that al-Qa&apos;eda doesn&apos;t exist.   In many ways, then, you could understand why this story took over the whole programme. Not only is it a famously riveting tale in itself, but Taylor also had gripping interviews with several of the people involved. (One Israeli sergeant, for example, wasn&apos;t sure which of the hijackers he shot - but prefers to think it was a German.) Nevertheless, it still felt something between a pity and a slight swizz that an event initially put forward as an illustration of wider trends should end up squeezing out any proper discussion of the trends in question.    Walton has a point here. Promising us analysis about the trends of modern terrorism, Taylor failed to deliver. But his was the opening night of a four part series.

Noa is studying photography in Jerusalem, Amir psychology in Tel Aviv, so they compromise by living together between the two, in the politically charged village of el-Castel. Part of Palestine until 1948, el-Castel was then taken over by Jewish settlers. It is now 1995, and Israel is reeling from the recent assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Noa and Amir&apos;s exuberant lovemaking and quarrelling cannot drown out the sorrow emanating through the party wall of their flat. Neighbours Moshe and Sima&apos;s eldest son has been killed in Lebanon; their second, Yotam, feels neglected. Both Sima and Yotam turn to Amir in different ways as he and Noa&apos;s intense relationship begins to implode. Leave it to time, implores the author, to see if his characters will outstrip &quot;the daily crushing march of love&quot;. The End of the Alphabet, by CS Richardson (Portobello, \u00a39.99) Successful, deeply contented Ambrose Zephyr is a well-trusted creative for a famous advertising agency. He adores his book-lined house, his pre-breakfast Sunday walk in Kensington Gardens and his wife, Zappora &quot;Zipper&quot; Ashkenazi, to whom he has been married for nearly 30 years. One April day, &quot;that odd time between a thin winter and plump spring&quot;, Ambrose visits his doctor for an annual check-up, to be told that, due to the incurable nature of an inexplicable disease, time is running out for him. Fast. Fighting blind panic, Ambrose and Zipper decide to make the most of his final days by visiting every place that Ambrose has ever wanted to see in alphabetical order, from Amsterdam to Zanzibar. But will they complete their desperate whistle-stop itinerary before Ambrose dies? And does it matter if they don&apos;t? An elegant little fable, charmingly written, and a tender, grateful paean to time, love and literature. Voice Over, by C\u00e9line Curiol, translated by Sam Richard (Faber, \u00a310.99) Grim determination is necessary to get through this book, although it is less than 200 pages. It is an intense monologue by a young Parisienne infatuated with a man who is in love with another woman. Craving yet shunning intimacy as a result of disturbing events in her past, the narrator works shifts as a train announcer at the Gare du Nord and reacts to her unrequited feelings by thoroughly debasing herself in a series of depressing sexual liaisons. Socially inept at a dinner party hosted by the object of her desire, she ensures attention by announcing that she is a prostitute. It&apos;s bizarrely childish, like much of the novel, which, if the repetitive self-indulgence is overlooked, is also intelligent, sharply observant and oddly brave. Little Monsters, by Charles Lambert (Picador, \u00a314.99) When Carol is 13, her father kills her mother in a drunken argument. Carol is summarily hustled away to live above a pub with her poker-faced aunt Margot, Margot&apos;s Polish refugee husband Jozef, and their son Nicholas. Only Uncle Joey is kind; Margot displays a scarcely disguised hatred for her. Years later, Carol is ensconced in a comforting partnership with Jozef, and works with displaced refugee children. After teenager Kakuna is rescued from a boat carrying illegal immigrants, Carol befriends the girl. To Jozef&apos;s dismay, her identification with Kakuna becomes disproportionate, and forces the couple to confront their pasts - Jozef the horrors of the second world war, Carol her family history. The parts of the book dealing with Carol&apos;s adolescence are very good indeed, but the more contemporary passages appear spurious and incidental.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-18T23:24:32Z", "title": "First novels: Apr 19", "sentences": ["Noa is studying photography in Jerusalem, Amir psychology in Tel Aviv, so they compromise by living together between the two, in the politically charged village of el-Castel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview16"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Uri Ben Ami washed down a mouthful of squid with a Maccabee beer and sighed as he sank into the folds of a padded deckchair on Tel Aviv&apos;s beachfront while Lycra-clad women sprang past on the wet sand. &apos;This,&apos; he said. &apos;Is as good as it gets.&apos; He chose to ignore the thrumming approach of two Apache helicopters returning from a sortie over Gaza to the south where dozens of Palestinians have died in attacks by their Hellfire missiles over the past months. Uri, a graphic designer, wanted to enjoy the modern wonder that is Israel. &apos;The fear and violence I&apos;m ignoring. It&apos;s always been there. Today it&apos;s good to be in Israel,&apos; he said. It is very nearly 60 years since Israel&apos;s birth, six decades of a controversial, violent, bloody history. On 14 May, 1948, 250 Zionists gathered in the Tel Aviv Museum to attend one of the century&apos;s most important meetings. At 4pm precisely David Ben Gurion - who would in a few moments become Israel&apos;s first Prime Minister - brought his gavel down for silence and, after a spontaneous rendition of &apos;Hatikva&apos;, the national anthem, began reading Israel&apos;s Declaration of Independence from handwritten notes. Twelve leaders of the Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, were unable to attend because they were already besieged by Arab forces in Jerusalem in a conflict which had erupted the year before when the United Nations voted to partition the British mandate of Palestine into Arab and Israeli zones. As the ink dried on the independence scroll, the armies of Syria, Jordan and Egypt threw themselves into a battle to wipe out the Jewish state. And it is a war which continues, in the view of many, to this day. Last week at least 22 people, including five children, three Israeli soldiers and a Reuters journalist, died in fighting between Palestinians and Israelis. The journalist and several Palestinians were killed or injured when an Israeli tank fired a flechette shell, containing thousands of darts, at the Reuters team.  Yesterday Hamas militants rammed a bomb-laden car into an Israeli border crossing, killing three of the militants and wounding 13 Israeli soldiers. It was the third major attack in less than two weeks on crossings used to transfer limited supplies of humanitarian goods and fuel to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, home to 1.5 million people. These were the latest attacks in a conflict which has been fed by Arab nationalism, Islamist hostility to Israel and its allies, and the threat of a nuclear Iran. The &apos;Zionist entity&apos;, as its enemies call it, remains an object of awe and envy. &apos;Israel makes us Arabs feel bad. It has no oil, no resources, no nothing, but it wins wars and, if we&apos;re honest, looks like a nice place to live. It exposes our own failings and that&apos;s why so many of us hate it,&apos; says Ibrahim Rajoub, who was visiting Palestinian relatives on the West Bank last week from his home in Jordan.  By the time the armistice was signed in the 1949 fighting, the 29,000 men, women and children of Israel&apos;s disparate militia and settler groups had grown into a force of 110,000. By then Palestine&apos;s Arabs had suffered the Naqba (catastrophe); 250,000 of them were driven from their homes by Israeli troops, sometimes using selective massacres and intimidation, into exile in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Their descendants still dream of returning to the fields and villages seized when Israel increased its land area by 50 per cent in under 12 months from what it had been allotted in the UN&apos;s 1947 partition plan. It violated the spirit of the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, said the government viewed &apos;with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people&apos;, but added: &apos;it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&apos;. The Zionist founders of Israel were in no mood for compromise. The Holocaust had driven home their desperate need for a safe haven - even if it meant fighting to hold on to it for generations. &apos;You cannot underestimate how important it was to us, and is to us, to have a National Home after being persecuted the world over,&apos; says Meir Lau, former Chief Rabbi of Israel and now Tel Aviv&apos;s chief rabbi.  Lau arrived in Palestine in July 1945 with his 19-year-old brother, Napthali, on a chartered Australian fishing boat straight from Buchenwald. He was the youngest boy among 200 survivors of Hitler&apos;s exterminations on the boat. &apos;When we landed at Haifa trains were waiting for us. They were cattle trucks, just like the ones that took people to Auschwitz, metal boxes with wire-covered slits for air. We were being interned by the British, who were trying to stop Jewish immigration into Palestine. When we arrived in the Atlit camp I saw men in uniform with guns and pistols. I said to my brother, &quot;I thought you were bringing me to the National Home for the Jews - are we going to be killed?&quot; It was months before we got out, but the lesson was that no one, not even the British, would help us. We would have to do this on our own.&apos; Tel Aviv was then no more than a few jerry-built blocks and huts, filled with the frequently starved and broken shells of humanity who had made it through the death camps. Today it is a thriving metropolis, part of a coastal belt which has the second highest number of internet start-up companies after the US, great beaches, and heaving night clubs amid some of the finest Bauhaus architecture in the world.  Israel has risen from almost nothing. There was no industry to speak of in 1948. Today Israel is a nuclear power with an economy still growing at 3 per cent, in spite of the costly 2006 war with Hizbollah in Lebanon. But above all the self-analysis and self-criticism of Israel, within what is the closest thing to democracy in the region, have given the Jewish state its greatest strength. It is hard to conceive of a British commission of inquiry daring to hand out the sort of drubbing given Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his top generals by the Winograd Commission, which accused Olmert of incompetence and knee-jerk strategy in the last Lebanon war.  But Israel is still defined by religious or racial parameters which mean that the Arabs who remained after 1949 found themselves subjected to military law for 18 years, were constantly harassed, and stripped of most of their land before being included as, almost, full Israeli citizens with a vote. Among them was the family of Sayed Kashua, 33, an Israeli Arab, one of Israel&apos;s leading Hebrew authors with two novels and a successful TV sitcom under his belt. &apos;My family stayed on, and didn&apos;t become refugees, because the armistice was signed just as the Jewish forces were approaching our village, el-Tira which sits on the &apos;green line&apos;, the armistice line of 1949 separating Israel from the West Bank. They had already shot my grandfather and uncle dead in the fields where they worked.&apos; The unfortunates who became refugees from the 1948 war still keep the keys to the homes they fled as symbols of their &apos;right to return&apos; enshrined in UN resolution 194. That right has been flatly denied by Israel, adding fuel to the Arab world&apos;s general desire to destroy the Jewish state. But Rabbi Lau is delighted by the success of the national home for the Jewish people. &apos;We have absorbed people from 140 countries. We have revived Hebrew as a living language, which is now a national tongue. We are a noisy democracy and there are six million Jews living in a country which is their home as promised to them in the Torah. That is most definitely a success&apos;. Israel expanded again in 1967 when it launched a pre-emptive assault on Egypt, whose ramshackle coalition of Arab armies was routed in just six days. Ironically, just as in 1948, the fighting provided the excuse for a second wave of land seizure by Israel, including East Jerusalem, Syria&apos;s Golan Heights, the Sinai peninsula (later returned to Egypt) and Gaza, as Israeli troops burst through the green line to take over the West Bank of the Jordan river. Although the Israeli cabinet originally discussed trading the newly occupied lands for peace with the Arabs, degrees of occupation have continued to this day, despite the Oslo accords and evacuation of Gaza. As a paratrooper in 1967, Avishai Margalit, a Zionist intellectual with no qualms about defending the country he had seen being born during the fighting in Jerusalem in 1948, took part in the Israeli capture of Jerusalem from Jordanian forces, then marched on Hebron to the south. Hailed as Zionism&apos;s final great achievement - establishment of a united Jewish capital in Jerusalem - Margalit (now a professor of philosophy at Princeton and the Hebrew University) saw things differently - even then. &apos;I knew then we were marching into a trap of our own making. Being an occupying power would be, and has been, the greatest threat to our survival and to the health of the country,&apos; he says. &apos;Now we are struggling to figure out how to get out of this trap we&apos;ve been in for 31 years. &apos;Worse still, while everyone sane recognises that we&apos;re going to have to get out of the West Bank and establish an independent Palestinian state, Israel is still building settlements on West Bank land taken from Palestinians, sowing the seeds of yet more hatred and violence.&apos; Since 1967 Israel has, illegally under international law, settled an estimated 250,000 people in the occupied West Bank and made it clear that only the smallest populations would be removed as part of a peace deal. And the Israeli Defence Forces have erected a vast &apos;security barrier&apos; of concrete and wire slicing off yet more Palestinian territory. And today, with the 60th anniversary of independence fast approaching, there are a significant number of Israelis on both left and right asking whether in the intervening period the Israel declared by its founding fathers as a largely secular, communitarian project has not somehow lost the plot. Israel&apos;s 1.7 million Arabs are these days seen as a &apos;demographic threat&apos; to the Jewish nature of the state in a country where some politicians have begun to talk openly of &apos;transfer&apos; of ethnic Arabs to Palestinian areas, or of slicing off Arab villages in Israel and handing them over to Palestinian control.  &apos;This kind of talk has started to make me feel frightened, where in the past I only felt like a second-class citizen. We relive the Naqba of 1948 every day I have been an Israeli Arab. For how long I don&apos;t know,&apos; says Kashua, whose home village, like most Arab-Israeli towns, is scruffier than nearby Jewish areas.  &apos;I cannot buy a flat in a Jewish neighbourhood - not even me, who is pretty well known and writes in Hebrew. There is probably greater resentment between the Jewish and Arab Israeli communities now than ever before. We&apos;re seen as a problem, not as citizens,&apos; he says. If Israel sees its Arabs as a threat, there is an even bigger problem closer to home. It is a familiar scene all over the world. A farmer passes down the line of stalls filling buckets with fodder, raising appreciative cries from his animals. Except that the farmer is Shlomo Kimschi, he&apos;s Jewish, this is the Holy Land, and the grunting creatures are pigs, destined for a slaughterhouse in Israel&apos;s booming pork industry. Such an unforeseen and, for many Jews and Muslims, abhorrent scene has its roots in Israel&apos;s first war. The village of Iblin was annexed in 1948. Tiny numbers of Christian Arabs who chose to remain were given dispensation to rear pigs in what the Ministry of Agriculture now calls &apos;red zones&apos;. Spotting an opportunity in the 1960s, Kimschi&apos;s secular parents rented land from Christian Arabs, about 20 miles east of Haifa. It was a smart move. In the 1990s a million new immigrants flooded in from the former Soviet Union, many devoted to guzzling pork. They created a boom in the market and Israel is now home to some 150,000 breeding pigs in northern Galilee. &apos;Those were good times for us. Ironically our industry is protected by Israel&apos;s kosher laws, which forbid the importation of meat from abroad. So we have the market to ourselves,&apos; says Kimschi. But for many Israelis this is a sign that the Zionist enterprise has gone badly awry - on top of the threats from the Arab world and Palestinian terror, Israel is losing its Zionist soul. Some of the most important institutions are coming under pressure. The army, once at the heart of the Zionist enterprise, is today beginning to take its toll on conscripts amid the burden of fighting in Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank. Historian Michael Oren, of the right-wing Shalem Centre in Jerusalem, points to a &apos;reluctance to join the army&apos; as a sign of a general &apos;collapse of the Zionist principles of self-sacrifice, probity and collectivism which have built and protected Israel&apos;. A quarter of the men and women called up for national service now slide out of it, claiming mental problems or religious exemption. And a growing number of seasoned soldiers from elite units and the air force are refusing to fight on moral grounds. Zohar Shapira spent 15 years as a member of the Special Forces, the Sayeret Metkal, ending as a warrant officer in charge of 13 other highly trained men before he decided Israel&apos;s occupation beyond the green line was bad for Israel as well as the Palestinians. &apos;I didn&apos;t kill anyone, thank God. But when you&apos;re kicking down doors and shooting live rounds over the heads of young children in their own homes, you have to question what you&apos;re doing. For many years I believed that the missions I went on were defending the Jewish state, but the immorality of what we did on the West Bank endangers the Jewish state. A country with no moral flags can become barbaric - it becomes a question of the laws of the jungle,&apos; he says in a coffee shop in Raanana. &apos;If things go on like this, with violence feeding violence - I&apos;m not sure I want to bring up my children here.&apos; Since the huge Russian immigration of the 1990s, there are at least 300,000 non-Jewish Israeli immigrants in addition to the 5.7 million Israeli Jews. The aggressive recruitment of immigrants means that Israel now has its own neo-Nazi movement. Last week three Russian immigrants in their late teens and one adult were sentenced to between 18 months and four years for assault and racism after filming one another beating up ultra-Orthodox Jews and homeless people. Four more members of the gang, Patrol 36, including the leader, Arik Bunyatov (known as Arik the Nazi), face similar charges after shocking videos were found on a Russian neo-Nazi website. A fifth, an IDF sergeant, has fled to Russia, where neo-Nazi websites hosted the group&apos;s videos. Zalman Gilichenski, himself an immigrant from Moldova, who monitors extremist anti-Semitic groups in Israel, says these are not isolated incidents. &apos;I get at least four calls a week about the desecration of Jewish graves, fascist graffiti and lots of personal attacks. Graffiti says things like &quot;Death to the Yids, Heil Hitler&quot;. There have been 500 incidents of attacks and abuse in the last two years and there are several hundred neo-Nazis in Israel. People who came in the 1990s, a lot of them did not feel Jewish or want to be Jewish but were in fact anti-Semites getting out of Russia. They&apos;ve passed their ideology on to kids brought up here. You have to ask what&apos;s the point of Israel if this goes on,&apos; he says. Meanwhile, if Jesus Christ were alive today among his earliest miracles would be to survive his own baptism, because of the profligate use of the River Jordan&apos;s waters for irrigation in Israel and the kingdom of Jordan. At the site attributed to St John&apos;s baptism of Christ, the Jordan is no longer a river. Thick, green, about 2ft wide, Israel&apos;s government calls it an &apos;effluent channel&apos;. &apos;It&apos;s mad,&apos; says Mira Edelstein. &apos;Israeli farms who get subsidised water use 70 per cent of all water in the country and produce 2 per cent of the GDP. The mountain aquifer on the West Bank is getting polluted, the coastal aquifer is getting salty, and our rivers are poisonous. We might have greened the desert, but at what cost? The state will collapse if it has no water.&apos; So, facing an enemy within, a demographic &apos;time-bomb&apos;, chronic water shortages, and a dwindling level of patriotism in defence, one might think things look bleak for Israel at 60. Isaac Herzog, the Social Services Minister and son of the late Chaim Herzog, Israel&apos;s sixth President and a former British army officer, complains of a lack of &apos;serious partners for peace among the Palestinian leadership&apos;. Even so, &apos;Israel had only enemies in the region when it was born. It had no international supporters, we were under siege, and no Arab country spoke to us. Now we have diplomatic relations with Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and part of a coalition that wants a two-state solution for the Israelis and the Palestinians. We have forged a country together from a mosaic of people from everywhere. Israel is a success. We survived and thrived in the toughest possible conditions.

James Miller was killed while filming a documentary in Rafah, near the border with Egypt. The journalist who accompanied him, Abdurahman Abdallah, said he was shot as he tried to leave a house while holding a white flag.  A British inquiry, based on a video of the incident, said Miller was shot in the neck by an Israeli army patrol. Miller&apos;s family is due to begin a civil action in the Israeli courts next month to decide culpability.  &quot;We have grave concerns that the suggestion from the Israelis that a settlement has been reached is merely a ruse to allow the Israeli defence submission to be delayed. They have asked for an extension,&quot; the family said in a public statement. &quot;Based on our experience with the Israeli authorities over the past five years and the fact that the action will take place in an Israeli court - albeit a civil one - we do not have a great deal of confidence in a fair or just outcome,&quot; it said. Previous attempts at out-of-court settlements failed because Israel had either &quot;reneged&quot; or &quot;renegotiated to our detriment&quot;, the family said. However, they indicated that they may accept the new offer. &quot;Having had an exhausting and expensive five-year fight, the possibility of an out-of-court settlement might be considered, although no agreement has been reached,&quot; the statement said. Israel&apos;s foreign ministry said negotiations were continuing with the Miller family but would not confirm the amount of the proposed compensation. &quot;We hope to be able to conclude these negotiations in the near future,&quot; the ministry&apos;s spokesman, Arye Mekel said. He rejected claims that the deal set a precedent.  Israeli officials told the daily paper Ha&apos;aretz that the legal aspects of the case &quot;had been settled&quot; as part of the deal. In return, the British government will end its action to extradite the Israeli soldiers for trial in the UK, according to Ha&apos;aretz. The breakthrough came following negotiations between Israel&apos;s foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and the British government. The British embassy in Tel Aviv said: &quot;We want a resolution as fast as possible,&quot; but added its role was limited as the negotiations were between the family and Israel&apos;s legal advisers. At the time of Miller&apos;s death, the army suggested he was killed by Palestinians. However, ballistic tests ordered by the family showed he was killed by the army. He was carrying a white flag illuminated by a torch, and other members of the group shouted that they were British journalists.

In Palestine, Palestinians, who also today celebrate 15 years of independent nationhood and the fulfilment of their national aspirations, extended warm congratulations to their Jewish neighbours. The legendary one-time Israeli and Palestinian premiers, after attending separate independence day rallies in their respective capitals, Tel Aviv and Ramallah, walked out together onto a raised podium in jointly administered Jerusalem, the two nations&apos; spiritual and federal capital, for a celebration with thousands of revellers. &quot;Words cannot express my pride and joy on this special day,&quot; a clearly emotional Shalom V, the charismatic Israeli ex-prime minister, told the assembled crowd as he fought back the tears. &quot;I am proud to be alive at this important moment in the Jewish people&apos;s history. Today, we can truly hold our heads up high as proud members of the family of nations, now that we and the Palestinians have found a way of living together in peace and prosperity. I would like to take this opportunity to wish our brothers and sisters in Palestine a happy 15th anniversary for their nation.&quot; A deafening roar gripped the mixed audience of Palestinians and Israelis who spontaneously began to chant the name of Salama B, the popular Palestinian ex-prime minister. &quot;Just 20 years ago, the idea that a Palestinian leader could be standing here wishing Israel a happy birthday was still unthinkable. It has not been easy for my people, who have shown for decades fortitude in the face of adversity, to come to terms with the painful reality that accompanied the loss of our land in 1948, but our Jewish brothers and sisters also suffered in their exile. Now they are safe among their brethren.&quot; Back in 2007, while the world was marking the 40th anniversary of the 1967 war, Israel was strangling Gaza and repressing the West Bank, and Hamas and Fatah were at war, Salama was on his fifth year in administrative detention in an Israeli prison. The passionate young idealist, a doctor was spurred by the images of Ariel Sharon entering the al-Aqsa Mosque complex with hundreds of troops to join the al-Aqsa martyrs brigade. He was engaged in a number of gun battles with the better-armed IDF soldiers, but was opposed to suicide bombings and attacking civilians. This set him on a collision course with the more extreme factions of the group, but the imminent standoff was averted by his capture and arrest during another shoot out with the Israeli army, ironically while tending to the soldier he&apos;d critically wounded. The Israeli officer in charge of Salama did not sympathise with Salama&apos;s assertion that, in a war, it was legitimate to attack soldiers. &quot;And if what you say is true, you&apos;re my POW until the end of this war,&quot; the hawkish officer famously said. Little did this officer suspect that he was aiding the prospects for peace. In prison, Salama learnt to speak fluent Hebrew and discovered a passion for history - and what he learnt about Jewish history did not quell the anger in his breast that he felt at the plight of his people, but it caused him to feel compassion for the other side. In 2008, Israel&apos;s 60th anniversary caused Shalom, then a junior Knesset member and historian, to suffer, in addition to his tearful joy, a crisis of conscience. He and Salama needed to reach out to the other side and started off a correspondence through which they became best friends before they ever met. Together, they realised the explosive effect of the past and of ideology and so set about to defuse it. Slowly, they formulated a common narrative which gave credence to both sides. It sought to replace the current epic Israeli and Palestinian histories with more nuanced ones. They also agreed to work together on &quot;bread and butter&quot; issues. Shalom, then only 31 and with no military background, began a clever and charismatic grassroots campaign calling for Salama&apos;s release. Once out of prison in 2009, Salama faced some suspicion of being a &quot;collaborator&quot;, but his natural intelligence and charm and his simple message of &quot;individual dignity before national pride&quot; won him many converts among the hard-pressed and downtrodden Palestinian population, at a time of Israeli closures and crushing occupation, international embargo, and civil war. And the many scattered groups involved in non-violent activism found in him and Shalom natural leaders. Together, Salama and Shalom effectively turned the Palestinian struggle into a civil rights movement for the next decade or so, winning Palestinians the hard-earned right to work and move freely across the entire land, which helped the two sides to see the human in the other. By around 2018, the movement they&apos;d spawned turned its attention to Palestinian autonomy, which was achieved in 2021. The vexed issue of refugees was handled through a sustainable number of Palestinians being allowed to return each year, compensation for those willing to stay away - and the entire Palestinian diaspora being allowed to visit freely. Some Arab countries which had had significant Jewish populations, such as Morocco, also instigated a right of return for those Middle Eastern Jews who had been made refugees after the creation of Israel and their offspring wishing to return to their ancestral homelands and revive the once-vibrant Jewish minorities there. Most of those who returned came from Europe or the US, but some also moved from Israel. After a dozen years of autonomy, rapid economic growth and convergence between Israel and Palestine, the time came to decide on the fate of the two nations. In 2033, two separate referendums were held among the two peoples outlining the options ahead. A majority of Palestinians and Israelis voted for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, but then, to the surprise of many, for its immediate entry into a federal union with Israel. The Palestinian state was born on the same day as the Israeli one 85 years previously, so that the day of Israel&apos;s joy - traditionally associated with Palestinian tragedy and despair - would also be that of Palestine&apos;s, marked according to the Gregorian calendar, rather than the former practice of using the lunar calendar common to Judaism and Islam. In addition, Israeli remembrance day was broadened to include the Palestinian nakba. &quot;Given the small size of this land and the proximity of our two peoples, that is the only sensible option,&quot; Shalom remarked at the time. &quot;In the past, we had our hands at each others&apos; throats. Today, our two peoples have voted to walk into the future hand-in-hand,&quot; said Salama, independent Palestine&apos;s first premier, as he and Shalom grabbed each others&apos; hands and raised them triumphantly in the air, hugging emotionally like the old comrades that they were.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-23T09:30:00Z", "title": "2048: a peace odyssey", "sentences": ["The legendary one-time Israeli and Palestinian premiers, after attending separate independence day rallies in their respective capitals, Tel Aviv and Ramallah, walked out together onto a raised podium in jointly administered Jerusalem, the two nations&apos; spiritual and federal capital, for a celebration with thousands of revellers."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/23/2048apeaceodyssey"}, {"tags": ["Hillary Clinton", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "US politics"], "article": "There&apos;s no new foreign policy information in Hillary Clinton&apos;s statement that a US reprisal would follow any Iranian attack on Israel. Despite the lack of a formal security guarantee, no one could seriously doubt that in the face of a threat to Israel&apos;s very existence, Washington would rush to its aid - and this support would include retaliating on Israel&apos;s behalf if Iran launched a nuclear strike. So, if by any chance Tehran managed to avoid a rain of Israeli missiles in the immediate aftermath of a raid, American ones would be there to take up the slack. And Iran, in Hillary Clinton&apos;s choice phrase, would be &quot;obliterated&quot;. According to the logic of deterrence, it&apos;s perfectly acceptable - nay essential - to make these kind of claims every so often. That&apos;s how the nuclear game works, and how we&apos;ve managed to avoid Armageddon for the past 60-odd years. So long as a country is assured of it&apos;s own vulnerability, it won&apos;t, so the doctrine goes, be the one to initiate war. That&apos;s why a completely secret nuclear capability makes no sense at all. If you don&apos;t flaunt it, there&apos;s no point in having it. Israel, though publicly denying its nuclear firepower, still indulges in the occasional spot of sabre-rattling. Iran, which as yet merely aspires to join the nuclear club, frequently rehearses its role as a fully paid-up member. So nuclear posturing is, in itself, nothing to get steamed up about - it&apos;s part and parcel of international relations. Clinton hasn&apos;t made a &quot;choice&quot; to support an attack on Iran. The decision to obliterate the country would be determined by harsh geopolitical realities, not personal preference. Faced with millions dead in Tel Aviv and a defiant regime in Tehran, Obama would most likely have to react the same way. But that kind of scenario, though possible, is really so unlikely as to be the stuff of fantasy. Clinton&apos;s comments are meaningful not because of their content, but because of their tone and timing. It&apos;s important for her to be seen as tough on foreign policy right now. Obama has raised the prospect of making friendly overtures to the governments of Iran and Syria, leaving him open to the accusation that he lacks the backbone required of a commander in chief. Add Jeremiah Wright to the mix and you&apos;ve got a candidate who can be cast as soft on America&apos;s enemies. Clinton was, of course, talking on the eve of her last best chance to regain the momentum in the race for the Democratic nomination - the Pennsylvania primary. She was desperately trying to up her share of the vote in order to still be seen as a credible candidate (and it looks as though she might just have succeeded). A super-tough stance on the foreign policy issue of the moment is a gamble, but it could help sway Democratic voters nervous of Obama&apos;s optimism, or flirting with the idea of voting for McCain - and it might give her a boost in national polls too. So Clinton&apos;s statement can&apos;t be taken at face value. But it will be distressing for ordinary Iranians (on whom the finer points of US domestic politics may well be lost) to find their country once again threatened and in such stark terms. And their reaction - likely to be one of horror and defiance - will be met by President Ahmadinejad with his own brand of apocalyptic prose. For more blogs on the US elections, click here.

There are two significant differences.  After the 1-1 draw at Liverpool on Tuesday night they are better placed to advance to the Champions League final - Ranieri&apos;s team trailed 3-1 to Monaco after a disastrous first leg - and with three league matches to go, unlike the class of 03-04, they have a fighting chance of winning the title. If they could beat Manchester United at Stamford Bridge today they would draw level on points at the top of the table.  Once again, though, the manager finds himself in peril. The parallels between Ranieri and Avram Grant are stark.  Both began with uphill struggles, after succeeding popular predecessors. At the beginning of his reign Ranieri would hear the home crowd chant the name of Gianluca Vialli, who had won the League Cup, European Cup Winners&apos; Cup and FA Cup. Likewise Grant continues to be serenaded by cries for Jose Mourinho, who won the lot domestically and fell just short in the Champions League. Ranieri was on borrowed time after Roman Abramovich took over the club in June 2003 and decided that he wanted more from his manager; the Italian felt that nothing he could do would be enough, and Grant has endured similar difficulties in justifying himself and his record. Grant, however, has the possibility of a lifeline. If Abramovich&apos;s ultimate football fantasy is to win the Champions League in Moscow, then the prospect is equally tantalising for Grant. Ranieri failed to overcome Monaco, to render the question hypothetical, but it now burns with fresh intrigue. Could Abramovich sack a manager who had delivered the Champions League? And would he remove Grant were he to win the Premier League?  In contrast to Ranieri, Grant&apos;s biggest problem is not Abramovich, it is further down the food chain. Ranieri won over the Stamford Bridge diehards and his final days at the club were characterised by &quot;Save Claudio&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t tinker with the Tinkerman&quot; campaigns. Given some of his previous notable defeats - St Gallen, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Viking Stavanger - that was quite something. It is a struggle, by contrast, to find a serious Chelsea fan who wants Grant to remain.  Grant heard the dreaded chant of &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing&quot; when he made his double substitution against Arsenal in the Premier League last month, at 1-0 down. The team rallied to win 2-1. He heard it again after Wigan Athletic&apos;s injury-time equaliser two weeks ago and there was unrest when he substituted Joe Cole at Anfield in the Champions League. Cole&apos;s replacement, Salomon Kalou, crossed for the equaliser. Chelsea supporters have never sung Grant&apos;s name.  For Grant it appears that the predators are in reverse order. The Israeli has struggled to win the respect of sections of the dressing room, and higher up, in the boardroom, the public support for him has been lukewarm. Peter Kenyon, the chief executive, has said he wants to see more enterprising football and Bruce Buck, the chairman, refused to give a yes-or-no answer when asked whether Grant would be in charge next season.  Abramovich is the man who matters. The owner considers decisions carefully but when he has reached his conclusion there is ruthlessness, as Ranieri can attest. The Italian knew that Abramovich and Kenyon had met with Mourinho&apos;s agent on the day before the first leg of the semi-final against Monaco.  Abramovich had been rumbled earlier that season meeting with Sven-Goran Eriksson, then England manager, but there have been no such dealings during Grant&apos;s time in charge. Abramovich wants him to succeed. After the frequent bouts of negative publicity under Mourinho, he prizes Grant&apos;s unflappable temperament. The club&apos;s image is important to the owner. He feels, with some justification, that it has improved under Grant. Seasoned Chelsea watchers have followed Grant&apos;s tenure with degrees of bemusement. &quot;It&apos;s a strange one because, when he took over, a lot of people were saying &apos;Top four, qualify for the Champions League and have a season of consolidation, maybe go for one of the cups&apos;,&quot; said Scott Minto, the former Chelsea player. &quot;Now they are the only team to be challenging United for the title, Grant&apos;s record has been excellent and he has a great opportunity to finish off Liverpool in a Champions League semi-final, which is something that Mourinho couldn&apos;t do - and his future is still up in the air.&quot;  Abramovich will not tolerate a season without silverware - Ranieri won nothing in four - and he wants to see the team play with greater flair. The stakes could not be higher; one slip now and the Abramovich sword will descend. Yet Grant stumbles on and he believes he can stay alive.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-26T01:18:22Z", "title": "Football: Grant's predicament gives Chelsea a  feeling of deja vu", "sentences": ["Given some of his previous notable defeats - St Gallen, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Viking Stavanger - that was quite something."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/26/premierleague.chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "It is a pity that your balanced and interesting feature, &apos;Israel: 60 Years of Hope and Despair&apos;, last week was misleading in two respects. First, it minimised the very real threat of annihilation faced by Israel in both 1948 and 1967. On both occasions, Israel was faced by a coalition of Arab countries whose avowed aim was to destroy the state and its Jewish population. On both occasions, too, the majority of outside experts believed Israel would be defeated The fact that the threat was averted is not a reason for pretending it didn&apos;t exist or ignoring the genocide of the Jewish population that would have followed. Second, despite discussing the impact of various waves of Jewish immigration, the article completely ignored one of the most significant, namely the influx of more than 600,000 Jewish refugees from persecution in Arab countries after 1948 (close to the number of Arabs who were displaced from present-day Israel). Unlike the latter, they were not left languishing in refugee camps for political reasons, and have therefore tended to be ignored by the pundits. Today, these &apos;Eastern&apos; Jews form around half the Jewish population of Israel. Harry GoldsteinLondon N14 It is difficult to know where the inaccuracies end and the dishonesty begins in Sam Kiley&apos;s rendering of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Kiley asserts it is &apos;a conflict which has been fed by Arab nationalism, Islamist hostility to Israel and its allies and the threat of a nuclear Iran&apos;. It is as if the illegal, military occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the rise of the settler movement which continues to steal Palestinian land with the backing of the Israeli government and the refusal by the same government to seriously entertain the notion of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state in any meaningful sense, count for nothing. Kiley refers to mysterious &apos;threats from the Arab world&apos; without specifying what these are and whence they originate: for the very simple reason that he can&apos;t because they don&apos;t exist except perhaps in his imagination. Greg StokesLeeds  Sam Kiley makes the ridiculous statement that in 1945: &apos;Tel Aviv was ... no more than a few jerry-built blocks and huts.&apos; I was there early in 1945 as an RAF pilot and witnessed the actuality: a handsome city of more than 200,000 inhabitants designed in part by Bauhaus architects who were Thirties refugees from Nazi Germany. Their work is now a Unesco World Heritage site. Kiley describes the 1945 Tel Aviv population as &apos;frequently starved and broken shells of humanity who had made it through the death camps&apos;. In fact, most had lived there since the Twenties.Francis BennionBudleigh Salterton, Devon Zionists are fond of their miracles. They cover up so much that would otherwise be called criminality by those less credulous than Sam Kiley. The flight of 750,000 Arabs - not the 250,000 claimed by Kiley - from what became Israel was a &apos;miraculous simplification of our tasks,&apos; said Israel&apos;s first President, Chaim Weizmann. No, it was ethnic cleansing. The victory of Zionist forces over neighbouring Arab states too is depicted as a miracle but the Zionists initiated hostilities a full seven months before the Arab states could mobilise and one of the Arab states, Transjordan, had a deal with the Zionists not to attack their forces.Mark ElfDagenham, east London You were wrong to call the 1967 war a pre-emptive strike by Israel.

Yossi Harel passed away yesterday after suffering a heart attack. He was 90. Twenty-five thousand Holocaust survivors packed onto four ships under Harel&apos;s command between late 1945 and early 1948. They sailed to Israel in an attempt to overcome British-imposed immigration limits on Jews. It was known as the &apos;Aliyah Bet&apos; (&apos;Aliyah B&apos;) movement - a phrase derived from the term &apos;Aliyah Aleph&apos; (&apos;Aliyah A&apos;), which was given to the limited legal immigration permitted by Britain, which then ran Palestine. The most famous of these ships was the Exodus, which was immortalised in the film of the same name directed by Otto Preminger and starring Robert Newman. Harel&apos;s daughter, Sharon, described her father as one of a &apos;generation of giants&apos; who rarely spoke about his career in the Israel Defence Forces and the secret service, Mossad. As a young man Harel became involved with the pre-Israel independent Haganah forces, a role that would see him be placed in charge of the effort to smuggle Jewish immigrants past the British blockades. The Exodus set sail on 11 July 1947 from a small harbour near Marseille. There were 4,554 Holocaust survivors jammed on board, none of whom were able to get immigration permits. The British fleet attacked the ship with gas bombs, forcing it to retreat and its passengers to return to the German camps from where they had come. Harel later said that every one of the people on board had an &apos;equivalent story&apos;. One boy he described had dug tunnels from a Nazi-guarded ghetto to the city outside. His father wanted his sister to escape but she refused to leave her parents. The boy later told Harel: &apos;I never saw my father, my mother, my sister; they went to heaven through the chimneys of Auschwitz.&apos; In a biography of Harel, the novelist and journalist Yoram Kaniuk argues that his efforts led to the formation of Israel: &apos;The state of Israel was not born on 15 May 1948, when it was formally declared at the Tel Aviv Museum. It was born a year earlier, on 18 July 1947, when a battered American ship, the &apos;President Warfield,&apos; renamed &apos;Exodus 1947,&apos; limped into the port of Haifa,&apos; he wrote. Others have likened it to the &apos;Boston Tea Party&apos;, which led to the American War of Independence. Kaniuk paints a picture of Harel as a bold, adventurous and responsible man whose family had settled in Palestine in the 18th century. He joined the Haganah at the age of 14. In 2007 Harel was awarded a prize, that was given the name of Exodus, by the Italian government for his efforts to promote peace and humanitarianism. The award is presented every year in La Spezia, Italy, where the ship was renovated for its mission. In the last few years of his life, Harel spent time collecting Russian art and pursuing business ventures.

I go out into the narrow alley between the concrete shacks of the refugee camp. Here most of the al-Absi family are standing round their home-made oven. From this ancient-looking monument of clay and straw Fathiya is bringing out perfect round flatbreads, brown-gold on either side. We open the balloons of bread, and Fathiya&apos;s 13-year-old daughter Noura offers round a little box of greenish powder that we sprinkle into the moist interior. This is the Palestinian great snack, good for mind and body: the bread is baraka, the same as the word for &apos;blessing&apos;, and the powder is za&apos;atar, a mixture of ground thyme, marjoram, salt and toasted sesame seeds. Neighbours have gathered, enticed by the smell, and everyone smiles as we sample that basic pleasure: new warm bread. We are in Gaza City&apos;s Beach camp, one of the world&apos;s oldest and most crowded refugee camps; so it&apos;s strange to be taking part in a foodie idyll straight from the pages of Claudia Roden. The feeling only grows when at last the pressure cooker is opened, revealing a glorious mess of beans inside: Palestinian foules. Into these Fathiya stirs dried mulukhiya (a spinach-like leaf, called Jew&apos;s mallow in England), salt, chilli and crushed garlic. I sit down with Fathiya and five of her children, a couple of neighbours, an Oxfam community worker and Jamal, Fathiya&apos;s husband, on the concrete floor of the al-Absis&apos; shack to eat. The dish cost about 10 shekels, \u00a31.40, and it will make three meals for the family. The bean stew is gorgeous - deep, spicy and satisfying. All it needs is a little bit of lemon, I say. &apos;Of course it should have lemon,&apos; agrees Jamal. He used to be a cook in a caf\u00e9 in Tel Aviv before the Israelis closed the border with Gaza and stopped anyone going to Israel to work. Though Jamal hasn&apos;t helped during the long morning&apos;s preparation for this meal, he is keen to let me know he is a professional. We all look at the cook: so where&apos;s the lemon, Fathiya? She looks up from spooning beans for her 10-month-old daughter, Urud, and shakes her head. &apos;There isn&apos;t money for a lemon.&apos; Tonight, some 4.5 million Palestinians, and 8.4 million others across the world, will eat supper as refugees - people who, according to the UN&apos;s definition, are outside their country of nationality or habitual residence because of &apos;well-founded fear of persecution&apos;. (There are 23 million more people who are displaced for similar reasons within their own countries.) As Observer Food Magazine&apos;s survey of refugee camps across the world shows, some of these people will eat adequately, some quite well, and others hardly at all. Long-term refugees like Fathiya, in well-established camps, do not live in immediate fear of hunger. But they must devote about every hour of the day to the job of getting their families fed. Other refugees live in much worse conditions, of course. Mukishimana Dusabe, a mother of five whom we interviewed in an &apos;unofficial&apos; camp aided by Oxfam, in the North Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is too frightened to go out to search for firewood to cook with. Her friend went foraging and was caught by soldiers who broke her arm and tried to rape her. Her son had disappeared; her young daughters have to work in the fields all day to get one banana to eat. &apos;I am a mother; I am scared that I will lose my strength and energy and that I will no longer be able to look after my family,&apos; she told us. By definition, refugees are a political problem. Very often the business of feeding them is one, too. Delivering food to the displaced is always complex: the logistics are usually horrendous - refugees don&apos;t naturally settle where it&apos;s convenient. The supplies may be &apos;taxed&apos; - the word the aid agencies use ironically - looted by whoever wields guns or power locally. The requirements of rich donors may mean the supplies have to be brought from far away, adding to the expense. All American food aid, for example, including much that&apos;s delivered to Gaza - has to be bought from American farmers. And of course, at all levels, soldiers and politicians oppose the feeding of refugees: if you don&apos;t give them aid, runs the argument, then perhaps they&apos;ll go away. Squeezing the rations or hindering the movement of supplies is a way of applying pressure for political ends - a habitual Israeli tactic in their war with Gaza&apos;s militant Palestinian government. Almost everything in Gaza comes from Israel, but since June last year little other than &apos;essential humanitarian supplies&apos; have been allowed in. This blockade is Israel&apos;s strategy to force out the Hamas government that refuses to recognise Israel or stop its militants firing rockets at Israeli towns over the border. Of Gaza&apos;s population of over 1.4 million, 1.1 million are dependent to some extent on food hand-outs. According to the UN, there was a shortfall of one-third in meeting this basic need between January and March this year. Many observers consider these tactics an abuse of the rights of refugees. These were enshrined by the United Nations in 1951 when the world was just recovering from the horrors of mass, forced movement of population during and after the Second World War. One of the most significant of those rights is to &apos;protection&apos;, which states quite clearly that host governments have a duty to look after refugees. And that includes seeing they get fed. According to the agencies, infant malnutrition in Gaza is up 60 per cent since the siege - as many call it - began. Though the Gaza Strip is territory occupied by Israel - which thus has specific obligations under international law to the refugees there - the business of feeding the 865,000 refugees who need food aid is the job of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. UNRWA started work with Palestinian refugees the year Israel was created, 1948, and so it has fed Fathiya, who is 40, and Jamal, 50, all their lives. They were both born in the Gaza camps to parents who had fled the 1948 war from villages around Ashkelon in Israel. The town is hardly 12 miles away but there&apos;s a 16-foot wall now between Gaza and Israel; neither of them has ever visited their family&apos;s&apos; villages. Every three months UNRWA delivers the ration. Because Jamal cannot work, the family gets an enhanced level of supplies. The basis of the hand-out is flour - a 75kg sack per person. There&apos;s also 50kg of rice and 6 litres of cooking oil, and some pulses like chickpeas, and sugar. Fathiya shows me one of the flour sacks - it&apos;s marked &apos;Wheat flour from Japan, for free distribution to refugees&apos; - and we do the maths. This morning she baked 160 pitta breads - half a flour sack&apos;s worth. Of the nine sacks she gets every 13 weeks there&apos;s usually three left over - these she sells in Gaza&apos;s markets, where a 75kg sack will fetch 70 Israel shekels, about \u00a310. This oversupply is intentional. As is often the case in organised camps the basic agency food basket only provides a proportion of a family&apos;s nutritional needs - in Gaza the target is set at 55 per cent. UNRWA&apos;s Chris Gunness says: &apos;We rely on there being a working economy in Gaza and that people have income to supplement the food packages, and buy things like eggs, dairy, protein, fresh fruit and vegetables. But that&apos;s getting more difficult: there&apos;s a cash crisis in Gaza, since the shutdown began last June. Ninety per cent of businesses have shut, according to the World Bank, and 100,000 jobs have gone in the private sector.&apos; Fathiya al-Absi&apos;s \u00a330 must be stretched to buy everything else for the kitchen. Lunch today needed yeast and salt for the bread, the garlic, chilli and herbs for the bean stew. There&apos;s also all the ordinary household expenses, and the cost of clean drinking water and gas cylinders. With the blockade these are now 55 shekels (\u00a38) each, and the family gets through three a month. Electricity is unreliable, too, since the power and fuel supply is also limited by the Israelis. The large fridge in Fathiya&apos;s tiny kitchen serves only as a storage cupboard. So Fathiya and her oldest son, Tamer, built the clay oven. They fire it with scrap cardboard and plastic bags. Happily the stink from those doesn&apos;t much affect the bread. The money doesn&apos;t stretch a lot further - to meat or fish, for example. The price of raw meat in Gaza has just about doubled since last June, and there&apos;s shortages of milk, too. I asked Fathiya&apos;s children what their favourite meal was: turkey shawarma, they all said. Ten-year-old Hanan had shared one with his father a few weeks ago - his face still glowed at the memory. But the family hasn&apos;t had any meat to sit down and eat together since last Eid, four months earlier, when some lamb was donated by the mosque. Though Fathiya&apos;s children seem healthy enough, it&apos;s no surprise that malnutrition rates in Gaza are five times those of neighbouring Egypt. Even before the blockade 17.5 per cent of children under five suffered from chronic malnutrition, while 53 per cent of women of reproductive age and 44 per cent of children were anaemic. When the meal is finished, the two little girls say they still feel hungry. &apos;They always feel hungry,&apos; says Fathiya. Her only other income is from her work for an Oxfam-funded sewing cooperative, where people from the Beach camp are paid 12 shekels a day (\u00a31.70) to make clothes that can be sold to residents. Fathiya also makes food for the workers there, for which Oxfam pays her. Much of that money goes to pay for 18-year-old Tamer&apos;s course in secretarial skills at Gaza&apos;s Al-Azhar University. Her father, Jamal, is too sick, he tells me, to work, even if there were any jobs. He lifts his shirt to show me the twisted purple scars he says are entry and exit wounds from an Israeli bullet. Privately, I&apos;m told that Jamal has other problems. Like a disturbing number of men in the Beach camp, many of whom used to make a living from fishing before the Israelis restricted the boats&apos; movements on security grounds, he has a drug and alcohol habit. Crack cocaine is one commodity that can enter Gaza from Israel quite easily: social breakdown and rising levels of violence within families are another side-effect that has to be attributed in part to the political impasse. The striking thing that unites all the women we interviewed in refugee camps is how much of their time is spent on the essential work of providing and caring for their families. For almost all of them the job occupied every waking hour. Fathiya&apos;s day begins at 6am, when she feeds Urud and cleans the two rooms where all the family live and sleep. The children she sees off to school without food - they will get a sandwich and milk when they arrive. Then, if, like today, it&apos;s a baking day, she starts making the bread. I tried to help her with this - but my kneading and pulling of the elastic pitta dough makes everyone giggle (still, when mine came misshapen out of the oven it tasted pretty good). Fathiya&apos;s family have what many refugees don&apos;t have, which is a form of stability. They lack much else, though, that we would think essential: a decent house, to begin with. Their current two-room shack is temporary. UNRWA knocked down their original house, not much bigger, because it was infested with lice. But, since Israel has not allowed any cement into Gaza for nine months, plans to rebuild the house have been put on hold by the agency. So the family have lived through the cold of winter with gaping holes in their walls and no heating. And during all those months the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been worsening. As we left Gaza that evening we watched Qassam rockets rising into the evening sky, aimed at Israel. One of them killed an Israeli civilian in the nearby town of Sderot: by the next morning, 33 Palestinians had been killed in the Israeli reprisals. Four of them were children who had been playing football not far from where we ate. It was, said Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, &apos;a proportionate response&apos;. The Gazans also lack hope - perhaps the most debilitating problem a refugee knows. There seems to be no prospect of a political solution to their long exile - more than one Gazan I asked said that the refugees&apos; only strategy was to have as many babies as possible. But no one I spoke to had any genuine expectation that this half-life might change. None of them, or indeed most of the four million Palestinians spread around Jordan, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, have known any life but that of a refugee. Some of the older ones remember, though. And they all speak with harrowing sadness of &apos;our village&apos;, of the homes they have lost in al-Nakba - the&apos;catastrophe&apos; of 1948. In Bethlehem the walls that enclose Aida refugee camp, another relic of that year, are painted with murals. Each one pictures a different lost village, its olive trees, green hills and chalk-white farmhouses. In Aida I met Ayesha al-Jarma, who was only six years old when her family fled Ajjur, near Hebron in the West Bank. She has been back, only once, when she was 25, to the ruins of her father&apos;s farm there. She has brought up nine children in the camp. Now she is a great-grandmother. &apos;We had a lovely life in the village,&apos; she told me. &apos;We used to make maftool (couscous) with lamb, because we had sheep and goats. Or with chicken, or doves, we kept them, too. There would be pine nuts and za&apos;atar for the rice. We grew wheat and vines, figs, apples and olives. We had watermelon and tomatoes and cucumbers.&apos; Did her children grow up differently, eating the UNRWA diet? &apos;Of course,&apos; said Ayesha. &apos;I always said to my children, you&apos;re like biscuits. You break so easily. In the village we&apos;d fall from the roof and not break anything. We were healthy, but you go to hospital every week.&apos; She sighs. &apos;Oh, how healthy were the children. And how happy.&apos; \u00b7 Read more from Alex Renton on the food of exiles here \u00b7 For more information on Oxfam&apos;s work in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, visit oxfam.org.uk/oxfam_in_action/emergencies/gaza_crisis.html.

Thirteen years later, the commander of that vessel, Yossi Harel, who has died of a heart attack, aged 90, became internationally famous as the character played by Paul Newman in the Otto Preminger film Exodus, itself based on Leon Uris&apos;s best-selling novel of the same name. Harel was just 28 when he became involved in the secret operation to smuggle Jews from Europe into Mandate Palestine. The British white paper of 1939 had restricted entry to 75,000 Jews over five years, a minuscule figure considering the numbers trying to flee Nazi Germany. Hopes that the postwar Labour government would annul the paper were dashed in 1945 when Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary, concerned not to exacerbate tensions with Arab countries, held fast to the prewar restrictions. So Jewish groups endorsed the idea of an illegal operation, Aliyah Bet (Immigration B), run by the clandestine naval force, Palyam, to circumvent the British-imposed limits. Harel was chosen to head the operation because he was daring yet plausible, and also had a passion for sailing. Already a seasoned veteran of the Haganah Zionist militia and a British military unit commanded by (then Captain) Orde Wingate, in all he ran four ships that carried more than 24,000 illegal immigrants from Europe to Palestine. But the voyage of the Exodus was the most famous.  The story began with the purchase of a discarded American steamer, the USS President Warfield, in Baltimore, in December 1946. Built in 1928, the ship had been attacked by a German submarine in 1942 and decommissioned in September 1945. Its buyers, the Weston Trading Company, a front for the Haganah, rescued a craft described as &quot;a matchbox splintered by a nutcracker&quot; from an appointment with the wreckers. In January 1947, the Warfield sailed for Marseille. The British, already wise to its use, blockaded the vessel off the Italian coast for seven weeks, but then let it go. On July 10, some 4,553 passengers, including 655 children, boarded the ship at S\u00e8te, near Marseille. Such a number clearly raised the stakes in the standoff with Britain. Most were Holocaust survivors who had already been barred from entering Palestine. In mid-July, under Harel&apos;s command, the crew unfurled the blue-and-white Star of David (later the flag of Israel), renamed the ship Exodus 1947, evoking the ancient Israelite flight from slavery in Egypt, and sailed out into the Mediterranean. On its voyage through international waters, the Exodus was escorted by the British cruiser Ajax and a convoy of destroyers. Harel had planned to slip away from the unwelcome escorts as he neared the coast of Palestine, but in the end he decided to ignore the British warnings to stop and make a run for the port. Spurred on by this act of defiance, the British intervened, firing a warning shot into the Exodus&apos;s bow and sending a detachment of troops to board the vessel. Under Harel&apos;s leadership, the passengers and crew resisted, and fierce fighting broke out on the Exodus. Three passengers and a soldier died, and many were wounded. The British then towed the Exodus into Haifa harbour, from where it was planned that the passengers would be sent back to France.  But the refugees refused to disembark and went on hunger strike. For 24 days - in the midsummer sun - the world witnessed the spectacle of the British preventing hungry and exhausted Holocaust survivors from finding shelter in a new land. Crucially, members of the UN special committee on Palestine were in the country at the time, and the Exodus affair influenced their subsequent decision to support the creation of the state of Israel. Eventually, British transport ships took the Exodus refugees back to displaced persons camps in Germany, but to Harel the episode was an inspiring moment - he wrote later that he saw &quot;a nation destroyed coming back to life&quot;.  Shortly afterwards, he showed a facility for diplomacy when he negotiated with Britain to send the passengers of two more ships, totalling 15,236 Jews, to Cyprus (most then secretly boarded ships for Palestine). He had previously led a perilous expedition on board a boat renamed Knesset Israel (Gathering of Israel). Having picked up 3,440 refugees from Yugoslavia, his vessel was caught in a storm in the Adriatic and then entered a minefield; a sister vessel crashed against rocks and sank, though its 400 passengers were rescued. Harel was born Yosef Hamburger in Jerusalem, where his family had lived for six generations. As a young man, he took labouring jobs in a quarry and laying post office cables. But his youth was troubled, and he ran away from home to join the Haganah. His biographer, Yoram Kaniuk, writing in Commander of the Exodus, called him a &quot;Zionist cowboy&quot;.  Harel was involved in the inter-communal violence between Arabs and Jews in 1929, but he also fought the British mandate forces at times, before signing up for the RAF during the second world war. In 1938 he became the personal bodyguard to Chaim Weizmann, later the first president of Israel; after the Israeli war of independence he moved to Los Angeles to study mechanical engineering. He then worked for military intelligence, and, in July 1954, Moshe Dayan appointed him head of Unit 131, the secret Israeli group that ran spies in Arab countries.  In later life, he worked in business and collected avante-garde Russian art. In 2003 he helped set up a memorial to Palyam near Tel Aviv. Last year, the Italian government awarded him their Exodus prize for those who promote peace and humanitarian efforts.  Harel is survived by three children, including Lady (Sharon) Harel-Cohen, wife of the venture capitalist and benefactor of pro-peace charities in Israel and Palestine, Sir Ronald Cohen, as well as eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \u00b7 Yossi Harel, naval commander and intelligence officer, born 1917; died April 26 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-04-28T23:00:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Yossi Harel", "sentences": ["In 2003 he helped set up a memorial to Palyam near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/29/israelandthepalestinians.obituary"}, {"tags": ["Human rights", "Pakistan", "Foreign policy", "World news", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Politics", "MI5", "Law"], "article": "After two weeks in a secret prison run by Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistani security agency denounced by human rights activists as one of the most vicious in the world, Salahuddin Amin says he was ready to do whatever he was asked. The college graduate from Luton claims he had been deprived of sleep for several days before being beaten, whipped and threatened with an electric drill. Then, he says, he was suspended by his wrists and beaten some more. His suffering appears to have been filmed, through a poorly concealed camera in the corner of the ceiling of his cell. After about 15 days of interrogation, he says, he was taken from his cell, blindfolded, hooded and shackled and pushed into the back of a car. After 20 minutes the car stopped and he was led into a building, up some stairs, and left alone in an air-conditioned room.  In an account that Amin has written of his 10 months in the ISI&apos;s prison, he describes what happened next. &quot;The door opened and a few people entered. When my hood was taken off I saw two white men standing in front of me. One of them looked at the major and asked if my handcuffs could be taken off. &quot;He introduced himself at Matt from MI5 and his colleague was Chris. His tone was friendly, which was a relief. Matt was a senior officer but Chris seemed more like an office boy and during the questioning he just took notes. Matt and Chris took their notebooks and pens out.  &quot;Matt had a list of questions, which I soon realised were from the previous interrogations by the major.&quot; It was, Amin and his lawyers allege, the start of a pattern that would be played out for the next 10 months: he would be asked a series of questions, under torture, and would give answers.  The torture would stop, and there would be another interview with the men later named at Amin&apos;s trial as Matt and Chris. Amin says he would be asked the same questions that his torturers had already asked, and he would give the same answers. Then the two British men would leave, and the torture would begin again, with a different set of questions. This was April 2004, and Amin, then 29, had moved to Pakistan three years earlier after graduating from an engineering course at the University of Hertfordshire. He says he was in search of a slower, more peaceful life. Police and the Security Service say he was in contact with senior figures in al-Qaida. He surrendered himself to the ISI after the agency contacted his uncle, a retired brigadier from the Pakistan army, to say the British were seeking his arrest.  A few days earlier, 18 people had been detained at addresses across the south-east of England and were being questioned over a plot to blow up the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, or the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London, with a half-tonne fertiliser bomb. Amin was accused of supplying the formula needed to mix the explosives. Unanswered questions Amin says the MI5 officers would insist that his main torturer remained in the room - &quot;as much as they hated him smoking like a chimney, and his mobile phone going off every few minutes&quot; - because they wanted this man to know which questions had not been answered. These, Amin alleges, would form the basis of the next torture session. The presence of the torturer also meant he felt unable to complain to the British about his treatment, although he does not believe this would have served any purpose, as he is convinced MI5 wanted him tortured. &quot;I assumed my treatment was tolerated by the British at a very high level,&quot; he would later tell the Old Bailey. After 10 months in ISI custody, Amin was put aboard a plane to Heathrow. There was no extradition process or court hearing. On landing he was arrested and charged with conspiring to cause explosions, and put on trial alongside six of the men who had been arrested in this country. He and four of those men were convicted after a year-long trial and are now serving life sentences. During the trial, Amin&apos;s counsel, Patrick O&apos;Connor QC, suggested to the jury that there had been &quot;a tacit understanding of some considerable amorality&quot; between MI5 and the ISI, with the British knowing their Pakistani counterparts could torture him with impunity.  The war on terror, O&apos;Connor suggested, &quot;has led those on both sides ... to share common standards of illegality and immorality&quot;. There may be some at MI5 who would argue that some very difficult moral decisions need to be taken to protect Britain from the sort of mass murder and suffering that Amin and his friends were convicted of plotting. In public, however, the agency has said nothing about the allegations that it has colluded in torture. It is impossible to report on the response that MI5 gave at Amin&apos;s trial: testimony from its officers was heard in camera, with press and the public excluded. Asked about the allegation that MI5 had colluded in torture, the agency&apos;s spokesman at the Home Office gave no comment. At Scotland Yard, however, one senior officer involved in counter-terrorism operations has conceded privately that he accepts Amin was tortured. Amin is not alone in alleging that MI5 colluded in his torture. A 33-year-old man from Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent more than a year in Pakistani custody after being picked up by the ISI in August 2006.  He says he was dragged from a taxi in Haripur, 40 miles north of Islamabad, and surrounded by ISI officers accompanied by a white woman. He was hooded and shackled and driven to a building where he was locked in a small cell that also had a camera fixed in a corner of the ceiling. The man&apos;s description of the place where he was held suggests that it was the same secret interrogation centre in Rawalpindi at which Amin had been detained more than two years earlier.  For the first 14 days, he says, he was deprived of sleep, beaten about the head during interrogation, whipped on the thighs and buttocks with a rubber lash, and beaten on the soles of his feet with a wooden stick.  On the sixth or seventh day, he alleges, one of his interrogators took a pair of pliers from a box and removed a fingernail from his left hand. He says that at the end of this process he was given a painkilling injection and his finger was bandaged. He says that on the following day a second nail was removed, and a third the day after that. He says that after each of these torture sessions he was given painkillers and his finger bandaged. &apos;Shackled and blindfolded&apos; After two weeks, he says he was given a change of clothes, shackled, blindfolded and hooded, taken from the detention centre and driven for about 20 minutes. When his hood and blindfold were removed he found himself in a well-furnished office with drawn curtains. Two men in their 30s walked in, introduced themselves as being &quot;from the British government&quot;, and questioned him for 30-40 minutes.  He says he was in obvious discomfort and his three fingers were clearly bandaged. He says he told these men that he had been tortured, but neither appeared to make any note of his complaint.  Eight months after his arrest, the man was transferred to prison. Five months after that he was driven to Islamabad airport where he says he met British consular officials for the first time. One, he says, told him he was returning to the UK where he would see his family and receive medical treatment. He says she also told him that consular officials had been refused access to him. On arrival at Heathrow, the man was arrested and taken to Manchester, where he discovered that four alleged associates had been arrested and questioned at the same time he says he was being tortured by the ISI. Two had been charged with terrorism offences, and he was charged with three counts of directing a terrorist organisation.  His lawyers are convinced that the two British officials who questioned him were from MI5, and that MI5 colluded in his torture. The lawyers say that three of his fingernails were missing when they first saw him, and that they have a pathologist&apos;s report that they say supports his allegation they were forcibly extracted. They also have a report from a psychiatrist who says the man is suffering from post-traumatic stress. A third British citizen, Zeeshan Siddiqui, also claims that he was tortured in Pakistan before being interrogated by British officials. Siddiqui&apos;s claims should perhaps be treated with some caution, as he has a history of mental illness.  What is beyond dispute is that he was detained by the ISI and spent eight months in Pakistani custody accused of being a terrorist. Given the agency&apos;s reputation, it seems unlikely that he would have escaped mistreatment.  And given that he is from Hounslow, west London, that he is a former London underground worker, and that he had been a close friend of Asif Hanif, who killed himself and murdered three others in a suicide bomb attack in Tel Aviv in 2003, it would be extraordinary if British counter-terrorism officials did not want to question him. &apos;Catheter forcibly inserted&apos; Siddiqui, 27, claims that after being detained in Peshawar, Pakistan, in May 2005, ISI agents threatened him, beat him and injected him with a variety of drugs. He alleges that he was chained to a bed for 11 days, had chemicals injected up his nose and a feeding tube pushed down his throat.  He also says a catheter was forcibly inserted and removed from his penis, causing bleeding. He was then taken to prison, where he says he was questioned by British intelligence officers.  Siddiqui&apos;s description of his first meeting is remarkably similar to that of the 33-year-old&apos;s from Manchester. He says the British officers began by explaining that there were people at the consular division of the high commission whose job it was to help British citizens, but then stressed: &quot;We want you to know that we are not those people, we are from British intelligence.&quot; In an interview with the BBC after his release, Siddiqui said: &quot;Every time they came I tried to make the point to them that I had been tortured. They admitted that they know the situation in Pakistan, the conditions were very bad in prison. They even acknowledged that, you know, torture is used in Pakistan.&quot;  It is unclear whether Siddiqui had been arrested at the request of UK authorities. Eventually he was released without charge and put aboard an aircraft to the UK, where he was subjected to a control order. In September 2006 he escaped from a psychiatric unit by climbing out of a window and has not been seen since.

Silwan is also home to one of the world&apos;s most important archaeological sites - the original Jerusalem where, according to the Biblical story, King David established his capital some 3,000 years ago. Elad never hid its goals: to control this sensitive site and replace Silwan&apos;s Palestinian residents with Jewish settlers. Like other settler organisations, Elad gradually found ways of influencing the higher echelons of Israeli power and gained permission to operate on the ground. In the winter of 1997-98, however, Elad suffered a series of setbacks. After several complaints were filed with the police, the Israeli state sued the settler organisation for building without permit on the historic site and for damaging archaeological remains. Meanwhile, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), who earlier thwarted Elad&apos;s plan to build 200 new homes over and around the excavations, was warning the attorney-general against handing over Israel&apos;s most important archeological site to an organisation on the margins of the law. Soon after, the Israeli supreme court held a hearing at which the Jerusalem Municipality and the Israel Nature and National Parks Protection Authority promised to reconsider handing the &quot;City of David National Park&quot; to Elad. The same court decreed earlier that Elad&apos;s acquisition of Palestinian homes in Silwan involved unlawful actions. Yet, as is often the case, the Israeli justice system proved ineffectual against the settlers. Today, 10 years later, Elad fully controls Silwan. The Palestinian neighbourhood is now dotted with a dozen settler outposts, clearly visible with their watchtowers, flags, and armed guards. Elad also runs the national park and visitors&apos; centre, providing tourists with an extremely one-sided version of history. Moreover, as the residents of Silwan know all too well, Elad also has the full backing of the Jerusalem Municipality, the National Park Authority, the Israel Land Administration, and the Jerusalem Police. Thus when a few residents filed yet another lawsuit against Elad&apos;s activities last month, the police stormed their homes that same night, and five people were arrested &quot;for theft&quot;. Those courageous enough to file a complaint at the police station itself were also instantly arrested. In short, Elad is the law in Silwan, where people joke that &quot;David&quot; in &quot;City of David&quot; stands for Elad leader David Be&apos;ery, Silwan&apos;s &quot;sheriff&quot;, who to this day resides in one of the homes whose acquisition the court decried. But perhaps the most unexpected accomplice of Elad is the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The same government agency that in 1997 warned against handing over the site to the settlers is now Elad&apos;s happy subcontractor. For on top of everything else, Elad runs all the excavations in Silwan: it decides where and when to dig and hires the IAA to do the work. This is a sweet deal for the budget-hungry IAA and for its archaeologists. It is also a sweet deal for the settler organisation. The IAA itself issues the required digging permits in an internal process of dubious legality, thus allowing Elad to turn archaeology into its most effective instrument of dispossession. Many open areas in Silwan have been fenced off as excavation sites, and the settlers have now sent the IAA to dig under Palestinian homes, probably in the hope that their lives will become so miserable that they will simply leave. The court has issued a staying order against one of these digs, but others have immediately popped up, and recent judicial history gives little scope for optimism. Elad is also pushing to destroy 88 Palestinian homes to expand the &quot;archaeological park&quot; in the area of the neighbourhood known as al-Bustan. International pressure prevented the demolition from taking place in 2005, but the plan has not been abandoned. Needless to say, the excavations run by Elad and the IAA violate professional rules of ethics concerning &quot;equitable partnerships and relationships&quot; between archaeologists and indigenous peoples (as stipulated by the World Archaeological Congress) as well as the universally accepted convention on excavation, including excavating in occupied territories (the New Delhi Agreements). That science is being sacrificed to serve a narrow political agenda can be seen from the fact that not one of the historical Muslim buildings in the national park has been preserved, and some were not even documented. Many Israeli archaeologists are unhappy with this situation, though most of them are unwilling to openly criticise the IAA, their main source for jobs and funds. Still, a small group of Israeli archaeologists led by Dr Rafi Greenberg (Tel Aviv University) has established ties with the residents of Silwan and has been lobbying for Elad&apos;s removal from the site. Renowned scholars throughout the world, including many senior historians and archaeologists, have signed a petition to the same effect. Another team of Israeli archaeologists has held talks with their Palestinian counterparts and came up with a historical document, the &quot;Israeli-Palestinian Cultural Heritage Agreement.&quot; But Shuka Dorfman, a former army general and the current director of the IAA, is unimpressed. In a recent interview wih Ha&apos;aretz, he responded to such initiatives by warning against &quot;bringing politics into archaeology&quot; and urged &quot;leaving these matters to the decision makers.&quot; In practice, all decisions about archaeological work in Silwan are taken by Elad. It&apos;s good to know that politics are not involved.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-01T15:30:00Z", "title": "Archaeologists for hire", "sentences": ["Still, a small group of Israeli archaeologists led by Dr Rafi Greenberg (Tel Aviv University) has established ties with the residents of Silwan and has been lobbying for Elad&apos;s removal from the site."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/01/archaeologistsforhire"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Immigration and asylum", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "     The shelter is in one of the poorest parts of Tel Aviv, an area of run-down strip joints, cheap cafes and patrolling police cars. There is no sign on the door but the overcrowded four-storey building is now home to at least 200 African asylum seekers, their numbers growing by the day in a new and sudden rush of migrants pouring into Israel.  Occasionally they are rounded up by police and jailed, only to be released again weeks, sometimes months later. Some are lucky enough to secure short-term work permits, though with heavy restrictions; very few ever get the official refugee status they seek and which some among them doubtless deserve. Yohannes Lemma Bayu is one of the few whose application for asylum succeeded, although it took him five months of campaigning and a 23-day hunger strike. He now he lives legally in Israel on a temporary but renewable residence permit.  He arrived 10 years ago from his native Ethiopia seeking asylum from political persecution - his father had been a minister in a previous government and their family was now under threat from the regime. But rather than leave to join the rest of his family in the United States, Bayu, 35, stayed and established this first shelter in Tel Aviv for the flood of new arrivals. &quot;I considered Israel a developed and democratic country and I believed Israel is respecting the rule of law. That&apos;s why I came here,&quot; he said. Like many others, he was also drawn as a Christian to the sites and history of the Holy Land.

At first most were from Sudan, some from Darfur but many more from the south of the country where they also faced political persecution and human rights violations.  Many had already spent months or years seeking asylum elsewhere, particularly in Egypt.  But then the Egyptian authorities began a crackdown - including one notorious incident in December 2005, when police killed 27 Sudanese migrants in an attack on a makeshift camp in Cairo. That in turn encouraged thousands of others to escape and take the risk of crossing through the desert and into Israel. Today they continue to come, the numbers now including many Eritreans, again escaping political persecution at home.  Some of the migrants are Muslims, many more are Christians. For Israel, a country built largely on the wave of Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, this issue has sparked a particularly intense debate. The Israeli military has stepped up patrols along the Egyptian border and the government has begun planning a costly border fence.  The prime minister, Ehud Olmert, reportedly told a meeting of senior ministers in March: &quot;This is a tsunami that can only get worse. We must do everything we can to stop it.&quot; In the shelter, many sleep on the floor and all rely on donations for food and clothes. Notices are pinned to the walls: rotas to share cleaning duties in the shelter next to advice about legal rights and healthcare facilities. One Eritrean, who gave his name only as Fisehaye, arrived in Israel seven months ago with his epileptic son Simon, 14. He had fled military service at home, then spent months in camps first in Sudan and then Egypt, before walking over the border into Israel.  &quot;We thought it would be better than the other places we&apos;ve been,&quot; he said. They were arrested by the Israeli military but then dropped off on the streets of Beer Sheva, in southern Israel. He made his way to Tel Aviv where he has shuttled between hospital visits and the shelter ever since. &quot;I&apos;m stuck here,&quot; he said. &quot;The living conditions are horrible but I can&apos;t go back to my country either.&quot; Along the corridor was another Eritrean, a 30-year-old woman named Teje. After five years in Sudan, she crossed into Egypt and then two months ago into Israel with her husband and their four children. Her husband was later arrested is still in jail.  She had an appointment scheduled with the local office of the UN high commissioner for refugees and hoped it might produce a temporary work permit. &quot;It feels like I&apos;ve been a refugee all my life,&quot; she said. &quot;We can&apos;t continue like this for ever,&quot; said Bayu, the shelter&apos;s director. &quot;We&apos;re doing the government&apos;s job.&quot; Israeli officials claim that many of those arriving are coming to seek work, not to escape genuine political persecution.  &quot;I think there is a common assessment inside the government that we have not adequately yet met this challenge,&quot; said Mark Regev, a spokesman for Olmert. &quot;But only a very small percentage of these people are refugees. Israel succeeded in building this country to be like a modern, European economy and we are maybe the only such country with a land border with Africa.  &quot;The overwhelming majority of people coming into Israel are people seeking to work illegally.&quot; But critics say the government&apos;s response has been haphazard and has fallen short of the requirements of the international convention on refugees.  Anat Ben-Dor is a lawyer who helps run a legal clinic at Tel Aviv University where for the past five years law students and lawyers have given free support to those seeking asylum.  They have so much work now they have to turn people away. She argues that many of those coming do have genuine cause for refugee status, which needs to be properly assessed. &quot;I&apos;m not underestimating the problem but I think Israel needs to build a refugee status determination system,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything they have done has failed. They are trying everything in their power to get rid of refugees and to try and make their lives as difficult as possible.&quot; When the Sudanese first began arriving they were arrested because they came from what is still regarded as an &quot;enemy&quot; country in Israel&apos;s on-going conflict with the Arab world.  Later they were released in their hundreds and allowed to work, particularly in resorts like Eilat, but only under stringent conditions.  Then there was an outcry last year when 48 migrants, mostly Sudanese, were deported to Egypt where some were arrested and went missing, and others were sent back to Sudan.  The policy was promptly dropped and instead temporary residency was given to around 600 Darfurians, an acknowledgement of the horror of the genocide they had escaped. Around 2,000 Eritreans have also received six-month work permits in another apparent concession. But further crackdowns are expected. &quot;This isn&apos;t the way the refugee convention is to be implemented,&quot; said Ben-Dor. &quot;Every single person asking for asylum should be individually screened and assessed, not be dealt with by group-based decisions. It&apos;s not something that&apos;s impossible to achieve but I think there&apos;s a resistance to accepting the way the refugee convention works.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-02T10:10:30Z", "title": "African immigration to Israel", "sentences": ["     The shelter is in one of the poorest parts of Tel Aviv, an area of run-down strip joints, cheap cafes and patrolling police cars.", "But rather than leave to join the rest of his family in the United States, Bayu, 35, stayed and established this first shelter in Tel Aviv for the flood of new arrivals.", "He made his way to Tel Aviv where he has shuttled between hospital visits and the shelter ever since.", "Anat Ben-Dor is a lawyer who helps run a legal clinic at Tel Aviv University where for the past five years law students and lawyers have given free support to those seeking asylum."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/02/israel"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "London politics", "UK news", "Germany", "Middle East and North Africa", "Holocaust", "Israel", "Europe"], "article": "Holocaust Day is usually one of the most somber days in the Israeli calendar. Since all Jewish holidays begin at sundown, the shops, cafes and restaurants shut down by 7pm, to prevent any merrymaking and crass commercialism. All Israeli TV stations are either closed or only show programs with Holocaust-related content. When I lived on a kibbutz founded by Holocaust survivors from Poland and Romania, the evening was dedicated to a gathering of the community with fitting music and poetry, while survivors of Auschwitz and other camps told their stories, or at least tried to, since one of them usually broke into tears and couldn&apos;t finish. There was even one survivor who managed to go eastward and join the Red Army to fight against the Nazis. Today the remaining survivors are reaching their 80s and 90s, with the overwhelming majority of Israelis having been born after the second world war. Still, the day is marked by a two-minute siren when everything stops, leaving every individual to his or her thoughts and memories. This year many Israelis were faced with an unusual dilemma. The crucial Uefa Champions League semi-final game between Chelsea and Liverpool was scheduled for the evening of Holocaust Day. This had particularly meaning for us, because Chelsea is coached by former Israeli national team coach Avram Grant, and Israeli national team captain Yossi Benayoun was in Liverpool&apos;s starting lineup. On a normal day, the game would have been highlighted on the main cable sports channel, and would have received a very high viewer rating. But according to the rules of Holocaust Day, the &quot;frivolous&quot; sports channel was closed until the following sundown. So what was a viewer to do? While the rules close most Israeli channels, there is a loophole which leaves open foreign channels that don&apos;t broadcast or have subtitles in Hebrew. Thus in marked display of dissonance with Holocaust Day, we could watch the sacrilegious Dalziel and Pascoe on BBC Prime, without the usual Hebrew captions. Since it turned out that the German channel Sat 1 was going to broadcast the Chelsea-Liverpool game, the Israeli broadcasting authorities were in a major quandary. Under normal circumstances, they would have blocked the channel. However, if Grant, the son of a Holocaust survivor, was ready to coach on Holocaust Day, they decided to allow the game to be shown. Thus I found myself experiencing the distinctly eerie feeling of watching the game on Holocaust Day accompanied by German commentary. After all, on any other day, it would have been broadcast with excited and knowledgeable Hebrew commentary! The game progressed, there was Drogba, Terry, Lampard, both Coles, Gerrard, Torres, Benayoun and their pals racing around the stadium, and there were periodic shots of Grant wearing a black arm-band with a small yellow patch worn by the Jews in the concentration camps. Grant&apos;s wife Tzofit, who was once one of Israeli TV&apos;s most uninhibited and brilliant (in my view) TV show hosts, said that Avram playing on Holocaust Day was a victory over the Nazis. I don&apos;t know about that, but the victory definitely belonged to Chelsea. That will not stop me from rooting for Manchester United in the finals. I may have been fascinated by the Chelsea-Liverpool match, but fascination does not replace team loyalty. And anyway, in Israel, Grant is associated with Maccabi, and I&apos;m a red loyalist in politics and sports (is there a difference?), whether it&apos;s Hapoel Tel Aviv or Man U.

Neither had I, until I read McMafia, Misha Glenny&apos;s eye-opening account of our criminal planet. This curious country is located somewhere east of Romania, but no other country has recognised it since it asserted its independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its people are impoverished and their rulers are an elite of ex-KGB officers and corrupt bureaucrats. The oligarch who bankrolls the government grew rich on smuggling arms into conflict zones across the world. Transnistria is a giant gangster theme-park, a haven for drug- and people-traffickers. And if it seems too remote to be worrying, consider that dozens of Soviet surface-to-air missiles capable of bringing down passenger jets have vanished within its borders. Transnistria is a stark illustration of the simple point that underpins Glenny&apos;s epic of reportage: there is far more to international crime than the activities of a few mobsters. Since the end of the cold war, illegal activity has come to account for 15%-20% of the world economy. Even if this figure is inflated by the inclusion of tax dodging, it is profoundly scary. Crime, Glenny suggests, is a synonym for globalisation in Transnistria, and in the many other places where states are weak or failing. In pursuit of this insight, Glenny has collected more stamps in his passport than any narcotics mule. The result is an analysis of world crime that is smart, serious and highly readable. Setting out from Bulgaria, with its enforcer aristocracy of steroidal Olympic wrestlers, Glenny takes us to meet the psychopathic Serbian ethnic-cleanser Arkan. Russia&apos;s mafia is there, of course, as is an unemployed Transylvanian nurse who became part-owner of a Hungarian gas company whose turnover leapt instantly from $12,000 to $2bn when it struck a mysterious deal with the Russian colossus Gazprom. Glenny interviews Bedouin youths who smuggle goods across the Negev desert by camel, and paints an unforgettable portrait of Dawood Ibrahim, the king of the Indian underworld and friend of Bollywood stars, who, at his peak - before he was discovered to have killed 113 people in the Mumbai terrorist bombs of 1993 - was residing in relaxed opulence in Dubai. If there is a criticism to be made, it is that Glenny occasionally lacks the patience to imprint a character and a situation in the reader&apos;s mind before setting off into the twists and turns of their criminal connections. But he blends in just enough academic sociology to make sense of a vast range of source material and, just as important, brings us movingly into contact with victims, such as Ludmilla, a Transnistrian girl kidnapped and smuggled via Moscow to a Tel Aviv brothel. Forced to service 20 clients every night, she was beaten savagely if she resisted. When finally she managed to escape, she was deported as an illegal immigrant and now finds herself destitute, HIV-positive and ashamed to go home. Her story, like those of the immigrant construction labourers in Dubai or the cockle-pickers in Lancashire, is just one of millions. At over 400 pages, McMafia amasses an irresistible weight of evidence to support some simple but telling conclusions. Transnational crime is a far bigger threat than terrorism. Offshore banking havens should be shut down. Capitalism without sound law enforcement is banditry. Tooting cocaine, visiting prostitutes and hiring untaxed immigrant maids are no mere peccadillos. And for any politician who hankers after immigration controls or yet another war on drugs, Glenny has a blunt message: it&apos;s the black economy, stupid. Wealthy Europeans figure in Glenny&apos;s far-reaching analysis largely as the consumers of criminal goods and services. But on April 11 2006, one wealthy European heavily involved in the production and distribution side was arrested after more than four decades as a fugitive from justice: Bernardo Provenzano, the capo di tutti capi of the Sicilian mafia. In Boss of Bosses, Clare Longrigg has penned an authoritative and absorbing biography of Provenzano, from his early days stealing cheese from Corleone farmers, to the moment when he reached out of the door of his hideout to take a bowl of ricotta, and gave away his presence to watching police. Provenzano assisted his mentor, Corleone boss Luciano Liggio, as he upset the balance of power within Cosa Nostra and challenged the Palermo clans. He supported the charismatic and dictatorial Tot\u00f2 Riina as he led the Corleonesi in the slaughter of the island&apos;s criminal old guard and mounted a frontal assault on the Italian state. Finally, when Riina&apos;s strategy backfired and men of honour were deserting in droves, Provenzano became a peacemaker - he piloted Cosa Nostra&apos;s &quot;submersion&quot; strategy, which was designed to take it below the media radar long enough to allow links with politicians and entrepreneurs to be re-established. Longrigg concentrates particularly on this last phase in the boss&apos;s career, during which Provenzano lived alone and almost permanently indoors. He typed his commands on scraps of paper so as to avoid being bugged. As Longrigg&apos;s exemplary research shows, his management method mixed fear with stalling, bluff and equivocation. Some of her most fascinating insights relate to the role religion played in both this Sibylline style of communication and in Provenzano&apos;s twisted self-image: he was doing the Creator&apos;s work. There are times when one wishes Longrigg had set her narrative in a broader context: that of Berlusconi&apos;s attack on the rule of law and of the vitriolic disputes within the Palermo magistracy that threatened the struggle against Cosa Nostra. But this is a book with many strengths, most notably Longrigg&apos;s attention to the domestic dimension of mafia life. Provenzano made every effort to keep his two sons from wasting their lives. Deprived of the mafia&apos;s avenues to status, they have struggled to live with the burden of their father&apos;s name and with the life of deceit that they were nevertheless forced to lead. Their testimonies - by turns shifty, confused and angry - are some of the most poignant in the book. If Angelo and Francesco Paolo Provenzano were to take the final step and collaborate with justice, then Sicily too would come closer to a future without the mafia. Perhaps the time will come when the island will have lessons to teach Transnistria, and all the other parts of the world now in thrall to the &quot;business of private protection&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-02T23:19:02Z", "title": "Review: McMedia by Misha Glenny and Boss of Bosses by Claire Longrigg", "sentences": ["But he blends in just enough academic sociology to make sense of a vast range of source material and, just as important, brings us movingly into contact with victims, such as Ludmilla, a Transnistrian girl kidnapped and smuggled via Moscow to a Tel Aviv brothel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/03/society"}, {"tags": ["Manchester United", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport", "Sir Alex Ferguson"], "article": "Sir Alex Ferguson has suggested that the Chelsea manager, Avram Grant, is resorting to desperate measures in an effort to influence the outcome of the Premier League title race following his criticisms of the West Ham manager, Alan Curbishley. Curbishley, whose West Ham team face United at Old Trafford today, claimed earlier this week that it would be an &quot;injustice&quot; if Chelsea were to deny United a tenth Premier League crown this season. Grant responded to Curbishley&apos;s comments by saying it was &quot;not a good idea&quot; to make such remarks ahead of the trip to Old Trafford which could have a key bearing on the title race. Last week Grant suggested that Ferguson&apos;s team were cracking under the pressure. Such barbs from Chelsea were commonplace under Jose Mourinho, but Ferguson has dismissed Grant&apos;s attempts to play mind games as United attempt to move to within one victory of the title by securing three points this lunchtime. Ferguson said: &quot;I think that Chelsea are prepared to try anything, so let them get on with it. I didn&apos;t read what was said, but I was told about it. I don&apos;t know why he [Grant] is suggesting there is going to be anything untowards. Chelsea should know better than anyone about these situations. I&apos;ve got a team that can answer any questions, though, and we do ourselves our own favours by winning our games, irrespective of what happens elsewhere.  &quot;But no matter what happens against West Ham today, Chelsea go to Newcastle on Monday and that is not an easy place to go because they are on the march now.&quot; Having twice thwarted United&apos;s title ambitions, with an Upton Park victory in 1992 and a final-day draw against Ferguson&apos;s men in 1995, West Ham arrive at Old Trafford with history, if not form, on their side. Indeed, they face United with the rare possibility of securing a fourth successive league victory against the champions. &quot;It&apos;s our job to make sure that history doesn&apos;t repeat itself against West Ham,&quot; said Ferguson. &quot;We&apos;ve got the players and the support, so everything is there for us to win.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s manager received support yesterday from Kevin Keegan, who recalled that when he was the manager of Manchester City Grant flew from Tel Aviv to spend a day shadowing the former England coach. On Monday the pair will be reunited at St James&apos; Park as the managers of Newcastle United and Chelsea but Grant can be assured of a warm welcome.  &quot;Avram came to Manchester City when he was with Israel and spent a day at the training ground,&quot; recalled Keegan. &quot;I liked him. He is not a guy who comes in and struts around the place, he is not John Wayne but he knows football and has done a great job at Chelsea - which is what he should be judged on.&quot; Keegan fears that Grant is not being assessed fairly and may be forever destined to attract harsh comparisons with his brasher, more flashy, predecessor at Stamford Bridge. &quot;I feel Avram Grant&apos;s had a really rough ride,&quot; said Newcastle&apos;s manager. &quot;He&apos;s in with a chance of winning a Champions League and Premier League double and has had a fantastic season at Chelsea. People may say he&apos;s still not doing a very good job there but, if Avram Grant is in trouble, it makes the rest of us look very vulnerable. &quot;People say he doesn&apos;t have charisma but I think he has got charisma. I think he&apos;s got a good personality. OK, he&apos;s not Jose Mourinho but how should we gauge managers? Are managers to be judged by how good they are on Sky TV, by how many jokes they tell, by how they get on with the media - or by results?&quot; &quot;I think where Avram has been very, very clever at Chelsea is that he has let the ship sail along. That is what Bob Paisley did at Liverpool after Bill Shankly. It&apos;s good management but it might not excite people,&quot; said Keegan. &quot;The trouble is that people want Avram to bring in 10 players no one else has heard of, as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is perceived to have done.&quot; Like Shankly at Liverpool, Mourinho will not be forgotten by Chelsea, but unlike Wenger&apos;s Arsenal, Grant&apos;s team have mustered the stamina to finish the season strongly. &quot;Chelsea did not have a particularly good start and didn&apos;t get many points in their first few games [under Mourinho] but, since taking over, Avram Grant has had a great run of results,&quot; said Keegan. &quot;I think if they had given him the chance to start the season in charge Chelsea would be champions now.&quot; Owner &apos;faxes the team&apos; Sir Alex Ferguson has made the remarkable claim that he knows of a club owner who &quot;faxes his team to the manager every Saturday morning&quot;. Ferguson, who admitted that the demands of foreign owners are making life more difficult for his fellow managers, not least Manchester City&apos;s Sven-Goran Eriksson, said: &quot;Nothing amazes you in football any more, but it [the treatment of Eriksson] is certainly a surprise. All different types of owners have come into football nowadays, though, and some want to be hands-on. I&apos;m very fortunate in that the Glazer family have been tremendous and just allowed me to get on with my job and it speaks volumes for this club.

Otherwise, the results are not at all what the US had hoped to accomplish. A democratic, pro-western Middle East is not in the cards. But, while things are not developing as American neoconservatives had intended, they are nevertheless developing. The historical failure named the Iraq war, the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the soaring oil and gas prices have wrought profound changes in the region. From Damascus to Dubai, from Tel Aviv to Tehran, a new Middle East is now emerging. The old Middle East arose from the borders and political identities created by the European powers after the fall of the Ottoman empire in 1918. Its driving ideological force was a European-inspired secular nationalism, which strove for political and social modernisation through top-down government action. This type of nationalism, or &quot;Arab socialism&quot;, reached its apex during the cold war, when it could lean on Soviet military, political, and economic support. Its end came with that of the Soviet Union, as it petrified into authoritarian, corrupt, and inefficient military regimes and dictatorships. The end of the Soviet Union also triggered a profound military crisis in many Arab states: without Soviet support as an external guarantor of their military capabilities, the nationalist regimes were no longer able to keep pace with military modernisation. The nationalist regimes thus gradually lost popular legitimacy, creating a vacuum that non-state actors have now largely filled. The ideological forces and the currency of power have also changed, with political Islam replacing secularism while skillfully integrating social issues and revolutionary, anti-western nationalism. Today, the old Middle East can still be found in Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, and Fatah-controlled Palestine. The new Middle East includes Dubai, the Gulf emirates, and Israel, as well as Hizbullah, Hamas, and jihadi terrorism - and, partly, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Jordan and Morocco are also trying to associate themselves with the new Middle East. Obviously, as these examples suggest, &quot;new&quot; does not necessarily mean better, but simply different and more modern. Indeed, modernisation by no means implies a solution to the conflicts that continue to fester in the region. Instead, these conflicts are themselves &quot;modernised,&quot; which could make them even more dangerous than in the past. An aspect of such modernisation could be seen in the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hizbullah, where tank warfare was rendered obsolete by missiles and Katyushas. At the same time, non-state actors, such as Hizbullah, Hamas, and al-Qaida, have taken the place of traditional armies, and suicide bombers equipped with road-side and car bombs or explosive belts have replaced guerrilla fighters with their Kalashnikovs. Perhaps the most important change is the shift in the region&apos;s political and military centre of gravity. While Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon defined the most important hot spots in the old Middle East, regional power and politics in the wake of the Iraq war is now centered on the Gulf. The dominant conflict is no longer the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, but the threat of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia for sub-regional supremacy, and between Iran and the US for regional hegemony. Indeed, it is by now virtually impossible to implement any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without Iran and its local allies - Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine. In a way, then, the war in Iraq forms the strategic and military bridge between the old and the new Middle East. The US intervention has brought about four far-reaching changes in the region: \u2022 Iran&apos;s hegemonic ambitions have been unleashed, and the country has been helped to a strategic position that it could never have reached on its own. \u2022 The democratisation of Iraq has empowered the Shia majority, which in turn greatly strengthened Iran&apos;s influence. Indeed, the war in Iraq has transformed the centuries-old Shia-Sunni conflict by infusing it with modern geopolitical significance and extending it to the entire region. \u2022 The rise of Iran poses an existential threat to Saudi Arabia, because the country&apos;s oil-rich northeast is populated by a Shia majority. A Shia government in Baghdad, dominated by Iran, would, in the medium term, threaten Saudi Arabia&apos;s territorial integrity - a scenario that the Saudis cannot, and will not, accept. \u2022 Should Iran manage to become a nuclear power, the Saudis&apos; existential fears would dramatically escalate. More generally, the currency of conventional military power in the Middle East would largely lose its value, inevitably resulting in a regional nuclear arms race. Emanating from this new situation is the threat of disintegration of the whole Anglo-French system of states in the Middle East. The first candidate is, of course, Iraq. Whether Iraq can be held together despite the ethnic and religious confrontations that pit Kurds against Arabs and Sunnis against the Shias is one of the most pregnant questions for the new Middle East. For Iraq&apos;s disintegration would be hard to contain; indeed, it could bring about a thorough balkanisation of the region. Another important question is whether political Islam will move toward democracy and acceptance of modernity or remain trapped in radicalism and invocation of the past? The forefront of this battle is, at the moment, not in the Middle East, but in Turkey; nevertheless, the result is bound to have more general significance. The emergence of the new Middle East may present an opportunity to establish a regional order that reflects the legitimate interests of all the actors involved, provides secure borders, and replaces hegemonic aspirations with transparency and cooperation. If not, or if such an opportunity is not seized, the new Middle East will be much more dangerous than the old one. In cooperation with Project Syndicate.

My CiF colleague Seth Freedman criticised my post on Friday, and I&apos;d like to address his comments here. At the centre of the debate is the two-page advertisement published in the New York Times Magazine this past weekend (and pictured above). It was a bit of a shocker. Here&apos;s the copy: &quot;You&apos;ll love Israel from the first &apos;Shalom.&apos; Who can say &apos;Shalom&apos; more eloquently than Maya Weiser? She found her first love - dance - when she was six. She became a member of the Bat Sheva Dance Company, performing in the beautiful Susanne Lelall Center in Tel Aviv, and at New York&apos;s Lincoln Centre. Recently she found a second love - saving the animals - so she is studying animal science at Hebrew University. Her next love? A considerable number of young men have their hopes up. Meanwhile, she dances and lives with her cat in the same Tel Aviv apartment where her father grew up. &quot;Israel. We hope to see you soon. Shalom!&quot; I&apos;m no expert on New York Times ad rates but I figure this had to cost them at least $250,000. Here&apos;s background on the campaign: &quot;Israel&apos;s Ministry of Tourism has launched a multi-million dollar advertising campaign in North America, designed to boost tourism to Israel from the United States and Canada. The budget for the campaign is an unprecedented $11m ... . &quot;&apos;Our goal,&apos; explains [Israel tourism commissioner for North and South America Arie Sommer], &apos;is to deflect the constant barrage of negative news images of Israel, and to show the country as it really is: sophisticated, hip, ancient, modern, friendly, spiritual and beautiful.&apos;&quot; What a waste! Not that it is a waste to promote Israel. On the contrary. But it is a waste to promote Israel under false pretences such as this. Look at this image: a beautiful girl, a strikingly modern city skyline. And look at the cool, clear, pristine reflection of the buildings in the water. The flash of this ad is betrayed by the murkiness of almost everything going on within Israel society now. The ad&apos;s clean lines mask an underlying social reality: an occupation; a nation adrift in despondency in the aftermath of the Lebanon war; a society buffeted by high-level sex and corruption scandals. And speaking of &quot;spiritual&quot;, let&apos;s juxtapose this ad with this recent headline: &quot;Four children killed in Israeli attack. A Palestinian mother and her four children were killed while eating breakfast yesterday in Gaza when Israeli missiles struck ... their house.&quot; I&apos;m no advertising expert, so I can&apos;t tell Israel how to promote itself. But I can tell Israel that as long as these headlines come out weekly if not daily, there isn&apos;t a hope in hell that its $11m tourism campaign will convince anyone other than Israel&apos;s die-hard supporters that &quot;No one belongs here more than you,&quot; as the campaign slogan inveigles. Last year, Simon Anholt produced a fascinating &quot;national brands index&quot; (pdf). He found Israel had the lowest brand ranking among all countries rated. One of his main points was that no amount of advertising can change the public&apos;s perception of a brand if it is fundamentally flawed. His answer: Israel must find a way to make peace with its neighbours before it can improve its battered image. This is the type of wisdom that Israeli policymakers and tourism directors would do well to heed. The thing that really broke the spell for me regarding this ad was the &quot;come-on&quot; for all the eligible male bachelors in the audience - the promise that you too might win Maya Weiser&apos;s hand and heart for your very own ... if you but make that trip to Israel. Not to mention Maya&apos;s newfound love for animals. Touching. It does make you wonder though whether Maya can muster similar empathy for Palestinians under occupation as she does for her beloved animals. I apologise to poor Maya. I don&apos;t mean to single her out since she&apos;s not at fault. My point is that the current warped situation of Israeli occupation makes victims out of everyone - Israeli and Palestinian. When Israel becomes a normal state without the albatross of subjugating millions of Palestinians, then it can proudly boast of its tremendous assets in an entirely unironic way. Until then, efforts like this one are hopelessly ineffective with anyone who isn&apos;t a true believer. Could Israel still promote itself in the international tourism market despite its moral flaws? Certainly, it could. But it would be necessary to create a far more nuanced campaign than the one pictured here. And nuance is something in short supply among Israeli government agencies, officials and apparently their advertising agency. Seth Freedman, in his CiF post, mischaracterises my argument. He writes: &quot;In his eyes, apparently the most realistic campaign would depict starving Gazans, shot and injured civilians in the West Bank, and the grieving mothers of suicide bombing victims. ... He is, tacitly or not, supporting a boycott of Israel in its entirety by demanding the country stops promoting itself to tourists.&quot; Those are opinions I haven&apos;t expressed, nor do I hold. Advertising certainly doesn&apos;t have to point up the product&apos;s flaws. But must a national advertising campaign entirely airbrush Israel in order to sell it? I am also neither tacitly nor explicitly supporting a boycott of Israel. In fact, as I stated in my original post, I don&apos;t deny Israel the right to promote itself, even during the occupation. I do, however, support &quot;truth in advertising&quot;, or at least greater truth than Israel&apos;s tourism authority has displayed here. I don&apos;t want people to abandon Israel. But I also do not want people to think that Israel is nothing but pristine beautiful beaches with charming ballet dancers offering come-hither glances. It&apos;s the job of social critics to say when the emperor has no clothes. A nation that is deeply flawed may be able to promote itself without being false to itself. But as Simon Anholt has pointed out, the effectiveness of such advertising is severely limited by the internal contradictions of the society whose brand is being promoted. Seth also omits my largest criticism regarding the ad. The ad pretends all is right with Israel. It is a country without any problems. In reality, the biggest problem, as Seth and I and so many others agree, is the occupation. Without Israel ending it and negotiating a fair peace with its Arab neighbours, not even a million Maya Weisers can sell this brand.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-05T19:00:00Z", "title": "Untruth in advertising", "sentences": ["She became a member of the Bat Sheva Dance Company, performing in the beautiful Susanne Lelall Center in Tel Aviv, and at New York&apos;s Lincoln Centre.", "Meanwhile, she dances and lives with her cat in the same Tel Aviv apartment where her father grew up."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/05/untruthinadvertising"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The two-storey house is built from hefty blocks of golden stone. Tall palm trees tower over the front garden, giving shade from the burning summer sun. There is a green, metal double gate, guarded on each side by stone pillars adorned with handsome metal lanterns. It is known as the Hallak house and it sits in a smart district of west Jerusalem known as Talbieh. This is a house of competing histories: a story of flight and dispossession and a story of immigration and achievement; the unresolved tragedy of the Palestinian refugee crisis and the remarkable rise of the Israeli state built on the ruins of the second world war. On Thursday, Israel celebrates its 60th anniversary with speeches, military parades, exhibitions and sports competitions. The true story of the rival legacies of what happened in 1948 lies in the history of buildings such as the Hallak house and in the lives of people such as Wilhelmine Baramki and Reuven Tsur, a Palestinian and an Israeli, born within two years of each other, whose families have both called this house their home. In 1948, Baramki was 13 years old, a child in a respectable Christian Palestinian family from Jerusalem. In the early 1930s the family built the house, and named it after her grandfather Hanna Hallak. As today, it was divided into apartments. Her grandparents lived downstairs to the right and at least three uncles and two aunts lived in the other apartments. Other rooms were rented out to tenants. Baramki, now 73, lived with her parents a few minutes away in another Christian Palestinian district of the city, Baqa, but she has memories of summers spent idly with her grandmother Farideh and her uncles and aunts in Hallak house.  &quot;There were fruit trees, a nice apple tree. There was a swing where we used to play. There was an open veranda where we used to sit with all flowers around,&quot; she said. &quot;Those memories were something for us. On Palm Sunday they used to pick all the nice flowers they had to make our palms. We used to love going there.&quot; Then came the brewing conflict in the months after the UN&apos;s failed attempt to partition British Mandate Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. One spring day, Jewish officials drove through Talbieh with a loudspeaker instructing the Palestinians to leave their homes immediately - there had been a shooting nearby.  Baramki&apos;s widowed grandmother and her uncles and aunts grabbed a bag and left quickly, seeking refuge in the family&apos;s other home in Baqa. They briefly returned but the shootings and bombings continued. Once they were shot at on a bus. &quot;Every night there were bombings, every day it was almost the same. My father told my mother: &apos;We can&apos;t keep going. We&apos;ll be shot one day,&apos;&quot; she said. They left to stay with another aunt who lived in the Old City, in east Jerusalem. &quot;Just for a few days we thought.&quot;  The war raged on and eventually they took refuge from the fighting by crossing into Lebanon. Before they left, her mother went back to the house in Baqa and with a maid she washed and ironed the laundry and tidied it away for their return. They locked the doors, carefully marking which key fitted which lock. It was the last time the family houses were theirs. In Lebanon they rented a house in the mountains and as the war escalated, weeks turned into months. A year and a half later they finally returned to Jerusalem, at least to the Jordanian-held east of the city. The west, including both Talbieh and Baqa, was cut off by a ceasefire line and was in the hands of the nascent Israeli state.  They were forbidden to enter. The Israeli state deemed them &quot;absentee&quot; property owners and their houses, like the houses of nearly all the other 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced out in 1948, were given to Jewish Israeli families, often to newly arrived immigrants, survivors of the horror of the camps in Europe. And so it remained until 1967. On June 4 that year, Wilhelmine Khoury, as she was then, married another Christian Palestinian, George Baramki, the son of a well-known architect who had also lost properties and land in Jerusalem, Jaffa and elsewhere in 1948.  The following morning, June 5, the couple were sitting aboard a plane on the runway at Amman airport in Jordan waiting to head off on honeymoon. They chose a bad day. Before dawn Israel&apos;s air force launched a devastating pre-emptive strike on Egypt, the start of the Six Day War that was to reshape the Middle East. The pilot ordered the passengers off the plane and out of the airport and the Baramkis left their luggage and raced home. Despite the fighting, they stayed on in east Jerusalem desperate not to lose another property to another war. Israel was quickly victorious, fatefully beginning the occupation that continues today of Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights. In Jerusalem, Israel seized and later annexed the east.  That meant two things to the Baramkis: they could now, for the first time, go back to visit their family homes from 1948, including Hallak house. It also left them refugees in their own city, for they had no right to claim back what was lost. &quot;We always had hope, but nothing doing,&quot; she said. &quot;Now we are present-absent. We are present here to pay taxes and everything, but absent to get back our property. This is the rule that they have,&quot; she said.  They still occasionally drive over to the west and look at their former homes. &quot;It was difficult the first time,&quot; said Wilhelmine. &quot;Then you get used to it. But it doesn&apos;t mean we have forgotten our claim to our houses and our land, too.&quot; Ghetto  The second half of the story of the house began 75 years ago and 1,200 miles away. Reuven Tsur grew up in a Hungarian-speaking Jewish family in what was then Transylvania and is today the Romanian city of Oradea. During the war, the family managed to escape the ghetto into which they had been corralled and they fled eventually to Budapest after his father, a prominent and successful baker, had survived 16 months in one labour camp and a brief arrest by the Gestapo.  His parents had for years been planning to emigrate, with their hearts set on Australia. Eventually, and in large part down to the cajoling of their son Reuven, they flew to Haifa, new immigrants to a new Israel. &quot;We saw Haifa at night. We saw the lights,&quot; said Tsur. &quot;We were driving through the empty streets of Haifa and my father saw the signs on the closed shops and the signs were in Hebrew. For my father Hebrew was associated with the synagogue and he told my mother: &apos;Look how many synagogues.&apos;&quot;  The family were taken to a camp for newly arrived immigrants and soon Tsur, who was just 16, was sent to a kibbutz, an ambition he&apos;d harboured for years. His father set up a bakery and Tsur went to study English and Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He became a teacher in the city and eventually a professor of Hebrew literature at Tel Aviv University, where he was a leader in the field of cognitive poetics.  In 1957 he married Ilana, who was born near Tel Aviv. The couple began to look for a house, somewhere with large rooms where Ilana could run her physical education classes. One day an agent showed them a small apartment on the ground floor of a large and impressive Arab house in a street now called Hovevei Zion (the Lovers of Zion). It was the Hallak house. &quot;I only saw the palm trees from the outside and I said: &apos;This must be a mistake. It couldn&apos;t be that beautiful,&apos;&quot; said Tsur. &quot;It was empty and nobody wanted it.&quot; They got a good deal, buying the apartment for 12,000 Israeli lirot, worth the approximate equivalent of \u00a325,000 today, from two Jewish landlords. The three-room apartment they had bought was part of the larger flat in which Baramki&apos;s grandparents had been living a decade earlier.  The Tsurs admit that they didn&apos;t think of its former occupants. Their neighbours were other Jewish immigrants from Europe and the Arab world who had poured into the new, fast-growing state of Israel. The Palestinians were long gone. Then came the 1967 war, and Israel&apos;s capture of east Jerusalem. &quot;Sure enough after a few weeks comes a very prominent gentlemen wearing an English suit and he said: &apos;OK, my parents lived here and I would like to see the apartment,&apos;&quot; said Ilana. The gentleman was almost certainly Wilhelmine&apos;s late uncle, Victor Khoury. Ilana showed him around, answering his questions about how much they had paid for the flat and what had happened to the grapefruit tree in the back garden. &quot;Emotionally I felt awkward. I had no time, I was working at that moment and I couldn&apos;t say I was very nice,&quot; she said. After the visit, she had the front door lock changed but she has to this day kept the original key still attached to her key ring. There were more visits from the Khoury family in the months and years ahead, all well-mannered and the two families, Israeli and Palestinian, sat and drank tea in the house they both called home. When the Baramkis and the Tsurs talk of the future they share a striking pessimism about the prospects of peace. The Tsurs argue, like many Israelis, that the Palestinians would not stick to any peace agreement that is made. The Baramkis argue, like many Palestinians, that Israel is more interested in colonising the land with settlements than in striking a genuine peace deal.  The Tsurs say they would give up their apartment in Hallak house if it truly meant peace would come and if they were given a comparable apartment in return, an offer rarely heard in today&apos;s Israel and perhaps shaped by their own so far fruitless attempts to claim compensation from the Romanian government for Tsur&apos;s family house in Oradea, which was confiscated by the Communist regime. They strongly believe that financial compensation alone is enough and that allowing the Palestinians who lost their homes in 1948 to reclaim them is unacceptable.  &quot;There seems to be a big difference between them and us because we don&apos;t want to go back and we don&apos;t want to have anything of it,&quot; said Reuven. &quot;We want to disconnect and they don&apos;t want to disconnect.&quot;  And on the other side of the city, the feeling is completely the reverse. &quot;It&apos;s our land,&quot; said Wilhelmine. &quot;We have a right to come back to our home.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T11:49:27Z", "title": "One home, two histories", "sentences": ["He became a teacher in the city and eventually a professor of Hebrew literature at Tel Aviv University, where he was a leader in the field of cognitive poetics.", "In 1957 he married Ilana, who was born near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/israelandthepalestinians2"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Art", "Middle East and North Africa", "Culture", "Art and design"], "article": "Side by side. Photo: Sama Shakra &quot;They who want to live in peace have to learn to live together&quot;. To Michel, a Christian Arab resident of Jaffa, his words made the utmost sense and were an incontrovertible adage by which to live his life - yet both he and I knew he&apos;d have an uphill struggle convincing the country at large of that fact. He said as much, noting that &quot;I can&apos;t teach everyone; only my kids and those around me&quot;, resigned to the winds of division that swirl around this region at an ever-quickening pace. We met at an exhibition where his teenage daughter&apos;s photography was on prominent display, as part of a project involving Jewish and Arab residents of the port city. The girls who took part were brought together by Sadaka Reut, an NGO that works to effect social and political change in Israel via joint youth activism with members of the Jewish and Arab communities. The project, according to photographer Leila Segal, one of its leaders, &quot;is different from other coexistence schemes, since it is deeply rooted in real relationships. The girls live and study in the same community - Jaffa - and this project helps them know and understand one another&quot;. During the project, the girls gathered in a series of workshops on &quot;home&quot;, &quot;community&quot; and &quot;the other&quot; to talk and explore these themes through photography. With Jaffa as their backdrop, they learned to use the camera as a tool to communicate their lives - to each other, as well as to the viewing public. At last night&apos;s opening - the culmination of their month-long efforts - it was clear that the scheme had achieved exactly what it set out to do. Arab and Jewish families mingled happily in the gallery&apos;s high-ceilinged halls, proudly inspecting their children&apos;s work and interacting as casually as in any other community where religious division plays no part. Of course, as individuals, those present were clearly not the type to preach separation and isolation, or else they&apos;d have boycotted the event as many others do in similar situations on either side of the divide. Despite Jaffa being one of the few areas of Israel where Arab and Jew live side by side in a physical sense, there is still a great deal of resentment and hostility bubbling under the surface, not least because of recent efforts to gentrify the area. Developers have spotted the arbitrage opportunity - the fact that Jaffa&apos;s underprivileged coastal streets are way behind the rest of Tel Aviv in terms of being built upon and sold off to wealthy investors - and the resulting invasion has caused a high level of friction. Several of the girls reflected their antipathy to the construction boom in their art. Sama, one of the artists, wrote that &quot;they are sucking everything out of Jaffa. They just want to build new, overpriced houses and push the poor people out&quot;. Her words were echoed by her fellow student Rimi, who noted alongside her pictures that &quot;even if there are new and clean houses, two metres away you can always find a poor family hungry for bread&quot;. Sama had taken a chilling photo of a wall erected by developers to keep the locals out, which was eerily reminiscent of the similar structure thrown up by the Israeli authorities to carry out the same task on a national scale. Other participants had focused on life inside their homes, displaying portraits of the same calibre and depth as Richard Billingham&apos;s &quot;Ray&apos;s A Laugh&quot; collection - a far cry from the type of work one might expect from such young artists. That they were all wise beyond their years was beyond doubt, and clearly working together on such a collaboration was much more than a superficial act of coexistence. &quot;I don&apos;t want to wear a mask - I want to show the real face of the world,&quot; wrote Mor Levy, a Jewish girl who refused to gloss over the inequalities in her neighbourhood, preferring instead to confront them head-on. Meeting her, as well as the other students, was a vastly encouraging experience - precisely because they refused to pretend that things would get better with no effort on their own parts. Sama, who is a feisty Arab girl of 18, pulled no punches when describing her vision for the country&apos;s future. &quot;The problem is, we&apos;re part of this country, yet when we turn on the TV all we see is adverts celebrating the 60th anniversary of [our being expelled from our homes].&quot; As she wrote in her exhibition notes: &quot;You see on the television that Jerusalem is important for the Jews: &apos;We must fight for the Jewish legacy.&apos; But what about the Arabs? What about us - our rights? Are we thin air? Don&apos;t we count?&quot; Her refusal to take her community&apos;s plight lying down, combined with her commitment to work with her Jewish neighbours, marked Sama out as an important spirit to nurture in order to try and resolve the problems that both sides are caught up in during the current stand-off. &quot;If you ask some of the Arab people here, they&apos;ll blame &apos;the Jews&apos; for what&apos;s happened to us, but that&apos;s not the case - it&apos;s just the government and the army who are to blame,&quot; she said. &quot;We say, &apos;the future of the Arab boy depends on the Jewish boy&apos;, and so we have to learn to work together - if we do, I believe we can really bring change. It has to be with the help of the Jewish people.&quot; By virtue of its already mixed community, Jaffa is an area where such collaborative projects must be capitalised on in order to foster relations between the two groups of people living there, as well as to build bridges where current developments appear to be doing the opposite. In that way, for every physical wall put up by the faceless developers, another emotional one will fall between those who&apos;ve lived in the town for decades. Opponents of joint schemes such as this only needed to sample the atmosphere in the gallery last night to see how vital Sadaka Reut&apos;s work is - and how much damage-repair it does in the long term.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T14:00:00Z", "title": "The art of living together", "sentences": ["Developers have spotted the arbitrage opportunity - the fact that Jaffa&apos;s underprivileged coastal streets are way behind the rest of Tel Aviv in terms of being built upon and sold off to wealthy investors - and the resulting invasion has caused a high level of friction."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/06/theartoflivingtogether"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Jonathan Freedland writes disingenuously of the &quot;Jews in the 1940s&quot; as the people who called for Palestine to be handed over to them, thus invoking the horrors of Nazi persecution (As it turns 60, the fear is Israel has decided it can get by without peace, May 7). But, as he must well know, one group of European Jews, the Zionists, had been calling since the end of the 19th century for Palestine to be turned into an exclusively Jewish state. Once the Zionists had gained the support of Britain and the new League of Nations, the Palestinian Arabs were doomed to become &quot;existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&quot; as Balfour put it, when in fact they formed 90% of the population. It would have been perfectly possible - as some enlightened Jews argued - for a national home to be built in Palestine, which had always had a small Jewish population, but the Zionists wanted all or nothing. They still do, and that is why peace is as far away as ever.Karl Sabbagh, Newbold on Stour, Warwickshire  I disagree with Jonathan Freedland that Israel is not a product of imperialism. The origin of the Zionist state began with the Balfour Declaration. However, writing as a descendant of American colonists, I certainly don&apos;t find it a fault. Freedland perceptively writes about the growing Israeli sense that working for peace with Palestinians and the broader Arab world is futile. He&apos;s right: it is futile because Arabs crave to drive Israelis from the land by any means. Israel&apos;s survival is an affront to the pride of people with something of an inferiority complex in that, culturally, they&apos;ve been materially outstripped by the industrial world. Tiny Israel, a western colony, has beaten them repeatedly in self-defence against Arab assaults. Freedland is right: right now, Israel doesn&apos;t need peace. It is improving control of its boundaries. And it can deal devastating blows to any neighbour who transgresses or against any harbouring those who will. Stephen Clark, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA  Jonathan Freedland is probably right that there is a mood of acceptance in Israel that they can manage on the status quo. The Israeli public has increasingly become immunised from the worst excesses of the conflict. Fast Israeli-only roads link West Bank colonies to Tel Aviv and other cities. A massive wall hides the Palestinian cities once visible across the Green Line but now under siege. Barely any Palestinians work in Israel now, and there is precious little interaction.  This complacency is all based on the dangerous premise that almost 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will tolerate endless occupation and collective punishment. With each passing week, more desperate acts might be considered. Both for Israelis and Palestinians there is no exit route except through a settlement based on land for peace. The rewards for Israel and its Arab neighbours of a full regional peace are immeasurable, but the question is whether this window of opportunity is closing?Chris Doyle, director, Council for Arab-British Understanding I am wary of those who divide the world into executioners and victims (Letters, May 3). I prefer to see conflicts as involving political actions and reactions on both sides. It might be more productive to view history through a lens that acknowledges political differences within both sides. I find it wrong, and reactionary, to pursue politics based on the perception of &quot;Israel&quot; and &quot;the Palestinians&quot; as unified collective subjects, and to defend the supposed underdog against the allegedly evil attacker. Both Israeli and Palestinian society are deeply split, and a European left ought to support the critical voices in both camps against warmongers, racists and ethnic cleansers.  None of this is to deny the responsibility that comes with power, but it does call for more in the way of understanding among those not directly affected by the conflict, and less in the way of instant unchecked historical expertise and a know-it-all vilification of a state and a people.Professor Robert Fine, University of Warwick", "publicationDate": "2008-05-07T23:08:55Z", "title": "Letters: Is the chance of peace slipping away?", "sentences": ["Fast Israeli-only roads link West Bank colonies to Tel Aviv and other cities."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/08/israelandthepalestinians1"}, {"tags": ["Higher education", "Education"], "article": "An Israeli man sits in front of an Israeli flag rising above the main road from Tel Aviv to Haifa.

Celebrations marking the 1948 creation of the state of Israel were muted by the growing crisis surrounding Olmert. The festivities, the fireworks, the military displays and the barbecues had barely finished when the Tel Aviv magistrates court loosened a gag order on the investigation, revealing that Olmert is suspected of accepting bribes involving &quot;significant sums of money&quot;.  The investigation, the latest in a string of corruption inquiries that have dogged Olmert since he took over from Ariel Sharon in 2006, began 11 days ago, when the national fraud unit, having received new information in another inquiry, interviewed the embattled leader.  Olmert&apos;s chief of staff, Shula Zaken, who is now under house arrest, and his lawyer, Uri Messer, have also been questioned, a police statement issued after the court relaxed the gag order said. &quot;It is suspected that the prime minister received significant sums of money from a foreigner or number of foreign individuals over an extended period of time, partly directly and partly indirectly,&quot; the police statement said. One of the foreigners at the centre of the scandal is a Long Island financier, Moshe Talansky, who is renowned for making significant political donations in the US. In a short statement from his Jerusalem residence last night, Olmert rejected the allegations and said he would resign if indicted. &quot;I look in the eyes of each and every one of you and I say I have never accepted bribes, never taken one penny to my pocket,&quot; he said. The scandal threatens to demolish the already shaky coalition government and raises questions about whether a general election would be required if Olmert resigns. It also risks overshadowing next week&apos;s visit by the US president, George Bush, who has scheduled the trip to celebrate Israel&apos;s 60th anniversary and to shore up the faltering peace talks with the Palestinians.  A brawl between police and Arabs who were protesting over Israel&apos;s birthday celebrations further dampened the anniversary mood. Nearly 2,000 Arab Israelis rallied near the ruins of Tzipori, an Arab town in the Galilee that was destroyed in the wake of Israel&apos;s creation in 1948. Violence erupted when a group of Israeli Jews arrived at the scene, prompting the police to intervene.

Magistrates in Tel Aviv yesterday lifted a week-old gagging order on details of the police investigation, which has marred Israel&apos;s 60th anniversary celebrations and threatens the fragile coalition government.  Olmert denied wrongdoing and said he would step down if he was formally charged, but opponents said the allegations alone \u2013 this is the fifth investigation into his affairs since he took office in 2006 \u2013 justified his resignation.  &quot;At this moment, the prime minister&apos;s attention isn&apos;t on matters of state and on running the country, and he&apos;s not worthy to lead the country,&quot; said Gideon Saar, of the opposition Likud party. Arieh Eldad, of the hardline National Union party, said: &quot;A state like Israel, with an existential threat, needs a full-time prime minister. Israel should go to general elections to replace him with a better government.&quot;  Smaller parties within the ruling coalition also called for him to go. Shelly Yachimovich, of the Labour party, said they &quot;cannot remain in the same coalition with a prime minister tarnished by such deep corruption&quot;.  However, Olmert&apos;s coalition partners were thought unlikely to pull out, which would force an election two years early.  Olmert said: &quot;I was elected to be the prime minister and I don&apos;t intend to shirk this responsibility.  &quot;At the same time, and even though the law does not require me to do this, I will resign if the attorney general decides to issue an indictment against me.&quot;  Investigators questioned the prime minister on May 2. &quot;It is suspected that the prime minister received significant sums of money from a foreigner or number of foreign individuals over an extended period of time, partly directly and partly indirectly,&quot; the police said in a statement. Olmert said he had received donations from Morris Talansky, a New York financier he had known for years, for mayoral campaigns in Jerusalem in 1993 and 1998, for the chairmanship of the Likud party in 1999 and an internal party election in 2002. Talansky had also &quot;helped him cover deficits&quot; after campaigns, he said. Talansky was the treasurer of a charity called the New Jerusalem Foundation which Olmert set up in 1999. Tax records show the charity declared more than $855,000 (\u00a3438,000) in donations from 1999 to 2002. A police spokesman said Talansky was a key witness, along with Olmert&apos;s secretary Shula Zaken, who is under house arrest, and his former lawyer Uri Messer.  Coded notes kept by Zaken recorded donations from Talansky, sometimes referring to him as &quot;the laundry man&quot;, a police source said.  Talansky rejected suggestions that he was part of a rightwing plot to smear Olmert and derail already shaky peace talks with the Palestinans. &quot;I&apos;m not involved in politics.

Hizbollah must realise the force of arms cannot intimidate us.&apos;  Calm had returned to west Beirut yesterday after two days of running firefights between Sunni and Shia militants, triggered by what Hizbollah said was a &apos;declaration of war&apos; by the government after it ordered the army to dismantle Hizbollah&apos;s secure telephone network and accused the group of setting up spy cameras at Beirut airport. By nightfall, Hizbollah and allied Shia militants had largely withdrawn from positions captured in Sunni-majority west Beirut after the army reinstated General Wafiq Shoukair to his position as head of airport security, despite a government decree for his removal, and vowed to investigate but not harm Hizbollah&apos;s communications. However, the confrontation looked set to be entrenched after a senior member of the government said that, following Hizbollah&apos;s &apos;military coup&apos;, the formation of a new cabinet would centre around a resolution to the group&apos;s armed status in Lebanon, an issue Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed was a red line. &apos;By turning its guns in on the country, Hizbollah has lost its status as a national resistance among the majority of Lebanese,&apos; said the official. &apos;We have an army and state institutions, and the ambiguity over Hizbollah&apos;s arms must be addressed. These are very difficult issues, but unavoidable.&apos; In a speech on Friday that triggered the worst violence since the civil war that tore the country apart between 1975 and 1990, Nasrallah pledged to &apos;cut the hand&apos; that touched his fighters&apos; weapons and rockets, accusing the ruling coalition of being &apos;Israelis dressed in suits speaking Arabic&apos;. The takeover of Sunni Beirut by the Shia opposition has dramatically shifted the precarious balance of power in a country riven with sectarian tension. Fighting between pro-government and opposition groups spread over the weekend to the Druze heartlands in the mountains south of the capital, while 10 people were killed as rival Sunni groups battled around the northern port city of Tripoli.  A Shia gunman from Amal, a Hizbollah ally, opened fire yesterday on the funeral of a Sunni civilian in Beirut&apos;s fault-line neighbourhood of Tarik al-Jdeide, killing two. At least 29 people have died in the violence since Thursday, with dozens injured. Hizbollah yesterday accused Druze leader Walid Jumblatt of responsibility for the kidnapping and deaths of two Hizbollah members in Aley, a Druze-majority mountain town south-east of Beirut, with a third still missing. The US and Israel have warned that the Hizbollah take-over of Beirut could trigger regional conflict, while Britain, Italy and France have readied evacuation plans for their nationals.  Turkey and Kuwait have already begun evacuating their citizens through Lebanon&apos;s northern border with Syria, the only open route out of the country. The road to Lebanon&apos;s airport has been blocked since Wednesday by Hizbollah supporters. Other land routes are cut off, and the Beirut port is also shut. As offices in west Beirut, the heart of Sunni power in Lebanon, belonging to parliamentary leader Saad Hariri lay torched and bullet riddled, Hizbollah fighters encircled the government building and Hariri&apos;s residence, demanding the prime minister&apos;s resignation. &apos;This is an Iranian takeover of an Arab capital,&apos; said a senior source inside Hariri&apos;s Qoreitem residence. &apos;Any Beirut government now knows that it lives under the barrel of the gun if it takes a decision against Iran.&apos; Hizbollah, which is armed and financed by Iran and is a strategic partner of Syria, has been leading opposition to the Sunni-led government, backed by the US, France and Saudi Arabia, having resigned from cabinet three months after its &apos;Divine Victory&apos; in a month-long war with Israel in July 2006. The 18-month political crisis that has left the country without a parliament or president was sparked in the immediate aftermath of the July war, when Prime Minister Siniora called a cabinet meeting to discuss disarming Hizbollah. In response, Nasrallah accused Siniora of being a &apos;traitor&apos; and working for Washington and Tel Aviv.  &apos;Before the July war, Hizbollah had called for a national unity government,&apos; said Amal Saad Ghorayeb, a Hizbollah expert. &apos;But after the war, they became much more vocal and hard-line because they saw that there was a clear US policy to use the government coalition to disarm Hizbollah and weaken Iran and Syria in the process.&apos;  The government&apos;s decision to tackle Hizbollah&apos;s infrastructure head on shocked diplomats and analysts in Beirut. &apos;Tackling the airport and telephone system was the first time since the Syrian withdrawal that the government has taken practical measures to deal with the resistance,&apos; said Patrick Haenni , Beirut-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. &apos;This was a paradigm shift by the government and it was met by a paradigm shift by Hizbollah, who said they would never turn their weapons in.&apos;  Under the Syrian military occupation of Lebanon, which ended in 2005 after widespread accusations of Syrian involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Hizbollah enjoyed a relatively free reign. But since helping end the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon in 2000, pressure has grown on the group, the only Lebanese militia formally allowed to retain its arms following the end of the civil war, to reach a new agreement on its status. In 2004, UN Security Council resolution 1559 called for the disarmament of all militias in Lebanon and, though the government confirmed Hizbollah&apos;s right to liberate the Israeli-occupied border area of Shebaa Farms, the Hizbollah cross-border raid that triggered the July War precipitated the issue of its status. Last week the tensions reached breaking point. &apos;I brought my two daughters out here earlier,&apos; said 50-year-old Abu Ali, a commander in Amal, as rocket-propelled grenades slammed into apartment buildings on Thursday night and gunmen fired deafening salvos across streets dividing Sunni and Shia neighbourhoods. &apos;I brought them out so they could see who their enemy was. &apos;God willing, we will control Beirut militarily and then we can catch all the traitors and then decide on a president and government,&apos; he pledged.  Within 12 hours, his Shia fighters had made good on that pledge, spreading from their strongholds in southern areas of Beirut to control neighbourhoods divided between Sunni and Shia before sweeping across Sunni west Beirut. But if the embattled government has pledged to take on Hizbollah&apos;s armed status, the Shia fighters pressed up against the walls of apartment blocks last week were in no mood to lay down their weapons. &apos;When we fought the Israelis in July 2006, the government accused us of going on a foolish adventure,&apos; said one fighter, speaking English through a black mask and brandishing an assault rifle. &apos;Now they are trying to disarm us and we say this is their foolish adventure.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-10T23:41:15Z", "title": "Lebanese declaration threatens civil war", "sentences": ["In response, Nasrallah accused Siniora of being a &apos;traitor&apos; and working for Washington and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/11/lebanon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Music", "Classical music", "Middle East and North Africa", "Culture", "Daniel Barenboim", "Conducting"], "article": "There are photographs hanging on the walls of my dressing room in the Staatsoper Berlin; photographs that remind me of what I see when I look out the windows of my house in Jerusalem. They are slightly faded and here and there the paper is crumbling, but one can easily recognise the views. The old city, the Dome of the Rock with its shining cupola, the walls, the gates. Sometimes I sit in this room before a performance, looking at these pictures and thinking of Jerusalem, of Israel, my home. Before 1989, this room was supposedly a refuge of the East German Stasi, the state police; if I happened to be a sentimental person, that fact would surely help me to become unsentimental, but I am not a sentimental person. The situation in the Middle East is much too close to me, much too personal for me to be sentimental about it. Since 1952 I have owned an Israeli passport. Since I was 15 years old, I have travelled the world as a musician. I have lived in London and in Paris and I commuted for years between Chicago and Berlin. Before I had an Israeli passport, I had an Argentinian one; later I acquired a Spanish one. And in 2007, I became the only Israeli in the world who can also show a Palestinian passport at an Israeli border crossing. I am, so to speak, living evidence of the fact that only a pragmatic two-state solution (or better yet, absurd as it sounds, a federation of three states: Israel, Palestine and Jordan) can bring peace to the region. My answer to those who say I am naive, only an artist? That I am not a political person, even if I shook the hands of David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres as a child; not politics, but humanity has always concerned me. In that sense I feel able and, as an artist, especially qualified to analyse the situation. Both my paternal and maternal grandparents were Russian Jews who fled to Buenos Aires in the pogroms of 1904. Unfortunately, I never asked my parents much about our family&apos;s history. For one thing, as a child, I was very preoccupied with myself and for another, it was &quot;normal&quot; that we were in a state of permanent change. The story of my maternal grandparents, however, is a very special one. When they arrived in the harbour of Buenos Aires (he was 16, she 14) after the miserably long trip, it was announced that only families would be allowed to disembark; the quota for all others had been exhausted. They were both alone, and my grandfather said to my grandmother, &quot;Let&apos;s get married!&quot; And they did. Once on land, they went their separate ways. After two or three years they met again by coincidence, fell in love and spent the rest of their lives with one another. This grandmother was a fervent Zionist. Already in 1929, she went to Palestine for half a year with her three daughters - including my 17-year-old mother - to see if one could live there. My father&apos;s family, on the other hand, had completely assimilated; the &quot;Holy Land&quot; had no significance for them, at least not until they discovered that I was musically talented. Suddenly it seemed important to my parents that I, as a future artist, should grow up as part of a majority and not as part of a minority somewhere in the diaspora. The conviction that normality would be a fundamental element of my intellectual development was, so to speak, fuel for the fire of my grandmother&apos;s Zionism: the Barenboim family resolved to emigrate to Israel. Our first stop on the long journey was Salzburg, where I participated in the final concert of conductor Igor Markevitch&apos;s summer masterclass. The entire trip took 52 hours with stops in Montevideo, Rio, Sao Paulo, Recife, the Isla del Sol, Madrid - and then we took the train from Rome to Salzburg. As a nine-year-old I spoke only Spanish and a bit of Yiddish, which I had learned from my grandmother. This was not especially problematic as we did not plan to stay in Austria and I would be mostly in the company of musicians. While I had not been aware of any Jewish problem in Buenos Aires, I began to take notice of one in Salzburg. Jewish friends took me along to Bad Gastein one day to a great waterfall and told me that, during the Nazi era, Jews had been thrown into it. Here I received my first inkling of the fate of the Jewish people; the stories my parents had told me about the Holocaust also deeply disturbed me, although I was unable to understand them fully at the time. In December 1952 we reached Israel. It was winter, the school year had started long before, and I had to learn a new alphabet and a new language. It was anything but easy, but since I was an uncomplicated and extrovert child, I adapted quickly, and it was the beginning of a wonderful and very intense new life. Everything was on the verge of change and progress. Imagine - in the streets of Tel Aviv, of all places, I learned to play football. Later on I became part of a youth movement and I still remember how much we looked down upon young men with moustaches and girls who wore lipstick; we felt they were superficial, simply not of the essence. Because my family had no money, we were supported in the beginning by an uncle from Brazil. His daughter is now the Brazilian ambassador to Slovenia - at least one Barenboim got somewhere ... As for the name, my family was encouraged to translate it into Hebrew in the new spirit of Jewish-Israeli self-confidence. Ben-Gurion, for one, whom I vastly admired as a statesman and visionary, came from the Polish city of Plonsk and was originally called David Gr\u00fcn. It was he who tried to convince my parents that I would never become famous with the name Barenboim (the Yiddish version of Birnbaum, pear tree); he felt that Agassi, the Hebrew word for pear, would be much better. One could always think I might be Italian. None of us, though, was truly enthusiastic about this idea. Strictly speaking, the length of time that I have spent in Israel is not substantial. It was mainly restricted to the years between 1952 and 1954 and between 1956 and the early 60s. When I was not in school, I was on concert tours in Zurich, Amsterdam or Bournemouth. In the winter of 1954 I went to Paris to study counterpoint and composition with the famous and famously strict Nadia Boulanger for one-and-a-half years. She taught me that the ideal musician should think with the heart and feel with the intellect. My parents accompanied me on all my travels, being of the opinion that it was necessary for me to have the most &quot;normal&quot; family life possible. The Europe of the 50s was deeply scarred by the consequences of the war. Being a traveller between both worlds, I found the contrast between Europe and Israel especially stark. Israel was at the time the most social, idealistic state imaginable. It was lucky for Israel and for us that we were young at the same time. Nobody had the feeling of working &quot;for the state&quot;, because there was no such thing. The state literally evolved before our eyes and fed on our idealism, our daily commitment, our work. To live in Israel as a Jew meant no longer pursuing only the so-called free professions as in the diaspora (artist, lawyer, doctor, banker), but also becoming farmers, police officers, soldiers or, as the case may be, even criminals. State and home, home and state, melded into one unit. The Israeli left wing, the workers&apos; party, was in power until 1977, an often forgotten fact. Twenty-nine years. Why was this so? The traditionalists had no chance after the war of independence in 1948; the war had already been won. The religious Jews were still waiting for the Messiah. That left the socialists. Only after the six-day war of 1967 did the winds change. The idea of a &quot;grassroots Israel&quot; paled. Suddenly there was cheaper labour from the Palestinian territories, and, not much later, the first Israeli millionaires appeared. The socialist system lost its balance; the idea of Israel teetered. I grew up in Israel with European culture and values; the director of my high school was an art historian, the kind of woman one might find in Berlin-Dahlem. This suited me very well, because in my rebellious adolescent phase I wanted to have nothing to do with Argentina, the Spanish language, or anything from the diaspora. For me this was all history. What counted was Israel&apos;s present and future. At the age of 19 or 20, I was called to do my compulsory service in the Argentinian military. I was able to postpone it twice, finally arguing that I should be exempt because I was a citizen of Israel. The result was that I could go anywhere with my Argentinean passport except to Israel, and that I could go anywhere with my Israeli passport except to Argentina. In 1966 I met the cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in London. We felt immediately attracted to one another, both personally and musically, and two or three months later, we decided to get married. Without any influence on my part, Jacqueline took it upon herself to convert to Judaism. The thought of eventually having children played a role in her decision, as well as the fact that she knew many great musicians who were Jewish. Her conversion was not always a boon to her career; one read and heard that she had joined the &quot;Jewish music mafia&quot;. In June 1967 we got married in Jerusalem, shortly after the six-day war. Ben-Gurion, who did not think much of music, was present at our wedding. He was impressed that a non-Jewish English girl could identify with his country so strongly. On May 31, when the war had seemed inevitable, we had flown to Israel on one of the last passenger planes. We had given concerts almost every evening. The last one took place on June 5 in Beersheba, a town halfway between Tel Aviv and the Egyptian border. As we were leaving the concert to drive home, the first tanks began to come toward us. After 1967 Israel turned very much toward the US - not necessarily to its own advantage. The traditionalists said: &quot;We will not give up the newly occupied territories.&quot; The religious Jews said: &quot;These are not occupied but liberated, biblical territories.&quot; And with that the end of socialism in Israel was sealed. For decades we have seen headlines about exploding violence; one war and terrorist act follows another. This has cemented the situation in people&apos;s minds. Today, in the time of Iraq and Iran, one hardly reads anything more about it, which is even worse. Many Israelis dream that when they wake up, the Palestinians will be gone, and the Palestinians dream that when they wake up, the Israelis will be gone. Both sides can no longer differentiate between dream and reality, and this is the psychological core of the problem. Since the 60s I have no longer felt comfortable in Israel. Of course, it is my home; my parents lived there and are both buried in Jerusalem. Whenever there was war in Israel, I played there: 1956, 1967, 1973. Music was my language, my &quot;weapon&quot;. However, after the black September of 1970, the then prime minister Golda Meir said: &quot;What is this talk of the Palestinians? We are the Palestinian people!&quot; At that point it clicked in my mind: this was morally unacceptable. Yes, the Jews had a right to their own state, and they had a right to this state. This demand was made even stronger by the Holocaust and the guilt of the Europeans after 1945. It is all too easily forgotten, however, that there was a moderate Zionism; there were people such as Martin Buber, who said from the beginning that the right to a Jewish state must be made acceptable to the existing population, the non-Jews. Militant Zionism, on the other hand, did not develop any further in its thinking. Even today, it is still based on a lie: that the land that the Jews settled was empty. Today, many Israelis have no idea what it must feel like to be Palestinian - how it is to live in a city such as Nablus, a prison for 180,000 people. There are no restaurants there, no cafes, no cinemas. What has become of the famous Jewish intellect here? I am not even speaking of justice or love. Why does one continue to feed the hate in the Gaza strip? There will never be a military solution. Two peoples are fighting over one and the same land. No matter how strong Israel becomes, there will always be insecurity and fear. The conflict is eating away at itself and at the Jewish soul, and it has been allowed to do so. We wanted to own land that had never belonged to Jews and build settlements there. The Palestinians see this as imperialistic provocation, and rightly so. Their resistance is absolutely understandable - not the means they use to this end, not the violence nor the wanton inhumanity - but their &quot;no&quot;. We Israelis must finally find the courage to not react to this violence, the courage to stand by our history. The Palestinians cannot expect that we should have been able to take care of anyone besides ourselves after the Holocaust; we had to survive. Now that we have done so, we must both look forward collectively. The Israeli prime minister who can do this has not yet been born. Essentially, we are no further today than we were in 1947, when the UN voted to divide Palestine. Worse yet, in 1947 one could still imagine a binational state; 60 years later, this seems unthinkable. Today, people in Israel speak of separation, of divorce in respect to a two-state solution: what cynicism! Divorce is normally only possible between people who once loved each other ... I suffer from this situation, and everything I do has something to do with this suffering, whether I am conducting Wagner in Israel (and I was by no means the first to do so), citing the Israeli constitution in the Knesset, founding the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra with the writer Edward Said, establishing a music kindergarten in Berlin, or - as recently in Jerusalem - performing a concert for two peoples. Some of these things are undeservedly exaggerated by the media, but I do as I do because it drives me crazy to see how much injustice we Jews commit daily, and how much we endanger the future existence of Israel. As cynical as it sounds, I am glad to have been born in 1942 and not in 1972. As it is, hopefully I will not live to see the day when it becomes possible that the State of Israel might no longer exist, just as I will no longer live to see the day when perhaps classical music may no longer play a role in our thinking and feeling. I have not lived in Israel for many years now, and I am very conscious of my outsider&apos;s perspective. Sometimes people ask me, &quot;What is a Jew?&quot; The answer is the following: a Jew who has antisemitic experiences in Berlin in 2008 is different from the Jew who had antisemitic experiences in 1940. The Jew of 1940 felt threatened; the Jew of today can think of his own land, of Israel. Today I can say, &quot;Either you learn to deal with me, you antisemite, or we go our separate ways.&quot; That makes an existential difference. I am a short-term pessimist about the Middle East, but a long-term optimist. Either we will find a way to live with each other or we will kill each other. What gives me hope? Music-making. Because, before a Beethoven symphony, Mozart&apos;s Don Giovanni or Wagner&apos;s Tristan and Isolde, all human beings are equal.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-13T23:11:00Z", "title": "Conductor Daniel Barenboim on his hopes for peace in the Middle East", "sentences": ["Imagine - in the streets of Tel Aviv, of all places, I learned to play football.", "The last one took place on June 5 in Beersheba, a town halfway between Tel Aviv and the Egyptian border."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/14/israelandthepalestinians.classicalmusic"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "US news", "George Bush", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "George Bush arrived in Jerusalem yesterday to celebrate Israel&apos;s 60th anniversary and talk up what has to be the most bizarre proposal yet for achieving peace: a &quot;shelf agreement&quot;. This, Bush explained before he set out, would be a &quot;description&quot; of a Palestinian state to be hammered out between the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert before the end of the year. The idea would then be to put this virtual state on the shelf until the time might be right for it to be turned into a reality. In perfect step, Tony Blair announced that he has succeeded in negotiating the removal of three checkpoints and one roadblock on behalf of the Quartet of big powers and the UN - out of a total of 560 throughout the West Bank - but Israel will only actually remove them &quot;in the future&quot;.  In other words, it&apos;s business as usual, as the crisis of occupation deepens. Neither man, meanwhile, seems to have thought it right to offer any words of condolence to the Palestinians, whose national dispossession and suffering were also unleashed by the creation of the state. That is why today - the anniversary of the end of the British mandate in Palestine and the declaration of Israeli statehood - is also a day of mourning for 10 million Palestinians and their supporters: the commemoration of the nakba, or catastrophe, that led to the destruction of their society and expulsion from their homeland. Ninety years after the Balfour declaration - when on behalf of one people a British cabinet minister famously promised a second the land of a third - the ruins of more than 500 Arab villages destroyed and emptied of their people in 1948 can still be seen all over Israel. That ethnic cleansing began months before the end of British rule, as has been meticulously documented by Israeli historians such as Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe, and before the arrival of the Arab armies, who mostly fought in areas earmarked by the UN for an Arab state. Sixty years ago, Arab Jaffa, now part of Tel Aviv, had just fallen to the forces of the embryonic Israeli state and tens of thousands of Palestinians had fled or been driven out, some of them literally into the sea. From there, they were evacuated by boat to Gaza, where 80% of the population today are refugee families from what is now Israel.  Morris now argues that ethnic cleansing was justified because a Jewish state &quot;would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians. There was no choice but to expel that population&quot;. It would certainly have been a different kind of state, but the expulsion was also a crime with devastating consequences both for the Palestinians and the Middle East. By the time the fighting ended in 1949, Israel had expanded its territory from 56% to 78% of Palestine, and the large majority of the Arabs, who made up two-thirds of Palestine&apos;s population before 1948, had become refugees barred from returning to their homes. The same process was repeated on a smaller scale when Israel conquered the rest of Palestine in 1967. And today the Palestinians are still waiting for the state which the UN voted to award them in less than half their own land - and they rejected as unjust - more than 60 years ago. It is to Britain&apos;s historic shame that having played such a central role in the creation of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the dispossession of a people it had promised to protect, it has done so little to try to right those wrongs. In Gordon Brown&apos;s message of congratulation to Israel, he didn&apos;t find it possible even in passing to regret the terrible injustices its foundation entailed. The fact is that the takeover of Palestinian land by overwhelmingly European settlers could only have happened under colonial rule, a reality which only fuels the long-term bitterness of the conflict. Israel was, of course, also born out of idealism and genocidal horror in Europe and can boast remarkable achievements. But it was the tragedy of the Zionist project that Jewish self-determination could only be achieved at another people&apos;s expense. Israel&apos;s independence and the Palestinian nakba are not just different national narratives, but diametrically opposed experiences which make one-sided tributes to Israeli nationhood seem so brutally galling in the Arab and Muslim world and beyond. Meanwhile, the western failure to take responsibility for the gaping wound it has inflicted on the Middle East is allowing the chances of the most plausible settlement - the much-acclaimed two-state solution - to slip away. While all Palestinian factions are in practice now prepared to end the conflict in exchange for 22% of historic Palestine and acknowledgement of the refugees&apos; right to return, there is clearly not remotely the commitment necessary in either Israel or its US sponsor to push through even such a lop-sided settlement. And as the carving-up of the West Bank into walled reservations, ever-expanding colonies and settler-only roads make the prospect of a viable state appear increasingly unlikely, it also seems to many Palestinians to have less and less to do with their aspirations to self-determination and dignity.  For some, that means returning to the goal of one state for both peoples - which has very few takers among Israeli Jews. Given that Palestine has effectively been one state under Israeli rule for more than 40 years - longer, for instance, than East Germany existed - others are being drawn towards a struggle for equal rights on the anti-apartheid model. Now there are almost as many Palestinians in Palestine as Israeli Jews, that appears an increasingly realistic option. It also causes panic in the Israeli establishment: &quot;If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses,&quot; Olmert warned recently, &quot;and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights ... the state of Israel is finished.&quot; What is certain is that there is no future for either Israelis or Palestinians in managing the status quo. If the Palestinians face nothing but shelf agreements and continued repression - 312 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military this year, 197 of them civilians, while five civilians and five soldiers have been killed on the Israeli side - the prospect must be of an escalating spiral of violence and misery. The commitment to Palestinian rights should first of all be a question of justice. But, given the toxicity this conflict brings to the entire relationship with the Muslim world, it is also a matter of obvious western self-interest. s.milne@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-05-14T23:44:00Z", "title": "Seumas Milne: The demand to make Palestinian rights a reality is no longer simply a matter of justice but also of self-interest", "sentences": ["Sixty years ago, Arab Jaffa, now part of Tel Aviv, had just fallen to the forces of the embryonic Israeli state and tens of thousands of Palestinians had fled or been driven out, some of them literally into the sea."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/15/israelandthepalestinians.usa"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "article": "On Israeli fiction Jacqueline Rose&apos;s survey of 60 years of Israeli literature (&quot;Chroniclers of pain&quot;, May 10) reminded me of a concert review consisting entirely of a critique of the percussion section. The Israeli novel, both in Hebrew and Arabic, has more dimensions than a response to Zionism, and as Amos Oz has wearily pointed out in interview after interview, it isn&apos;t always allegory. Sometimes it&apos;s about jealousy, or marital breakdown, or teenage homelessness, or your best friend committing suicide. David Grossman&apos;s See Under: Love is not just a depiction of Israeli society failing to come to terms with the Holocaust, but a novel about the imagination; about a child populating the silences with fantasy and a writer of children&apos;s stories forced, Scheherazade-like, to retell the plots of his stories to save his life. Writers as diverse as Aharon Appelfeld, Grossman and Etgar Keret have remarked on the influence of Kafka (whose literary executor Max Brod fled to Tel Aviv in 1939) on their own work, as well as that of Bruno Schulz. Israeli literature is not only preoccupied with nationalism and opposition to nationalism, but has been engaged in a continuation of the European literary tradition that was terminated by the Holocaust - Kafka and Schulz were its great expressions. There is so much to say about Israeli literature, including the revival of the Hebrew language, that to boil it down to a single narrative (however crucial) about colonialism results in an essay more about politics than the arts.

If she wants contemporary philosophy that engages with life and its problems, she should try, for instance, Daniel Dennett, Harry Frankfurt or Thomas Nagel. All draw on and contribute to the ongoing, meticulous, technical work of philosophers around the world. All realise that there are no shortcuts. Dr Sam Clark  Philosophy Department, Lancaster University Ian Curtis&apos;s Bible studies Jon Savage is right to call attention to the influence of &quot;highbrow&quot; literature on the work of Ian Curtis (&quot;Controlled chaos&quot;, May 10), and he paints a vivid picture of the intellectual aspirations of that generation. But it is odd that such an incisive critic should fail to acknowledge (perhaps for reasons of ideology) the importance of Christianity in Curtis&apos;s output. The final masterpiece, Closer, in particular, is drenched in imagery and language derived from the King James Bible and Cranmer&apos;s Book of Common Prayer. To take just a few examples: &quot;Moving along in our God given ways&quot; (from the song &quot;Passover&quot;); &quot;God in his wisdom took you by the hand&quot; (&quot;Colony&quot;); &quot;Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone&quot; (&quot;The Eternal&quot;), and so on. Curtis&apos;s interest in religion is well documented, and his was perhaps the last generation in England for whom at least a passing acquaintance with the heightened language of religious ceremonies was the norm. Paul Lay London First, not second, division &quot;So why, you may ask, should we be interested in how a second-division playwright ... manages to quit smoking?&quot; (Audio, May 10). As well as his sublime diaries, Simon Gray has written more than 30 plays, which stand up remarkably well in any company. Of these I would pick Butley, Otherwise Engaged, Quartermaine&apos;s Terms, The Common Pursuit, Japes and The Old Masters. And he didn&apos;t manage to quit smoking in The Last Cigarette.

When he was last in the region, four months ago, on the heels of the Annapolis conference, he had declared that he was optimistic peace and prosperity could be brought to the region. Instead, its hot spots have grown hotter, while the deadly flames are threatening to consume new territory all the time. Bush will not be stopping at Beirut. The Red Sea resort of Sharm al-Sheikh may have been judged to be an altogether calmer location for his meeting with Prime Minister Siniora, than the troubled Lebanese capital, where festering tensions have recently erupted into violent street clashes between government supporters and the Hizbullah-led opposition. That the American president should be avoiding Lebanon is thus understandable. The political equation that he and his administration have striven to consolidate there after the short-lived euphoria of the &quot;Cedar Revolution&quot; has all but evaporated. The camp they have been backing through the last 18 months of political feuding, and institutional paralysis, has never looked weaker and more shaken than it does this week. For much of its modern history, Lebanon has been the battlefield for regional power struggles and the window where the Middle East displays its balance of power. There is no such thing as strictly domestic Lebanese politics. The country&apos;s political landscape has always been drawn outside its tiny borders, by the powerful regional and international players of the day. What goes on in that small stretch of land offers a reflection of current shifts in the region&apos;s political chessboard and a glimpse of their possible outcomes. Having forced Syria to withdraw from Lebanon in the aftermath of Hariri&apos;s assassination in 2005, Washington embarked on a mission to redraw the country&apos;s labyrinthine political map. By lavishing political, financial and military support on its allies in the March 14 group, the administration sought to marginalise those it regards as representatives of the Syrian-Iranian axis - spearheaded by Hizbullah and the Christian Maronite leader General Michel Aoun. As part of this confrontational strategy, it blocked any consensual resolution of the crisis, insisting on Hizbullah&apos;s disarmament - a task which Israel had failed to achieve in 33 days of brutal bombardment back in 2006. But as the recent events in Lebanon have painfully illustrated, this policy has ended in abysmal failure. The noose which Washington has worked tirelessly to tighten around the opposition&apos;s neck now threatens its friends. On Monday, the leaders of the pro-US alliance, Saad Hariri and Waleed Jumblatt, were besieged by opposition forces, for hours unable to set foot outside their residences in Beirut and the Mount. For Washington, Lebanon is the most recent - though, perhaps, not the last - in a series of failures and setbacks unleashed by the Iraq catastrophe five years ago. The situation is not much better in Palestine next door. For months, it had raucously demanded that Palestinians hold legislative elections - a move designed to bolster Mahmoud Abbas&apos; frail legitimacy after the death of the charismatic Yassir Arafat. But yet again, its predictions proved disastrously miscalculated. Much to its horror, Hamas emerged as the winner, elected by a majority of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Rather than strengthened, Abbas and his team were further weakened. Just as it had done in Lebanon recently, Washington moved to widen the rift between the rival sides. It worked to undo the landmark deals signed in Cairo and Mecca aimed at bringing the conflict to a close through unity a Fatah- Hamas national unity government. The administration went as far as to conspire with warlord Mahmoud Dahlan and his militiamen to topple the elected government and engineer a Palestinian civil war. Mahmoud Abbas and his administration ended up being driven out of the Strip, and the engineered chasm culminated in one government in Ramallah and another in Gaza. Iraq was supposed to be the midwife for the birth of the &quot;new Middle East&quot;, a Middle East where the US, Israel and their allies reign unchallenged. In truth, Washington was right; the invasion did have a domino effect on the wider region. The Iraq earthquake generated tremors which have been felt across the entire Middle East. From Iraq, to Lebanon, and Palestine, the ground is increasingly shaking under the feet of Washington and those who have bound their political fortunes with it. Not only has the administration been unable to settle the conflicts raging there in its allies&apos; favour, it has been placed on the defensive, increasingly pushed to the corner by its emboldened opponents. Through its string of misguided military adventures, fought directly, as in Iraq, or by proxy, as in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, Washington has caused the pendulum to swing away from its friends and towards the &quot;axis of evil&quot;. Perhaps what Waleed Jumblatt, the seasoned Lebanese politician (who may be regretting his decision to desert the Syrian camp for Washington&apos;s), has told the Guardian last Monday is just as true of the Middle East as it is of Lebanon. &quot;Hizbullah and Iran won the battle of Beirut,&quot; he said. &quot;The Iranians chose the moment America is weak in the Middle East. The balance of power has completely changed in Lebanon and now we wait to see what new rules Hizbullah, Syria and Iran will lay down.&quot; The distance between the &quot;New Middle East&quot; he envisioned in 2003 and the Middle East he visited this week has never been greater. All Bush&apos;s sweet promises of prosperity and democratisation have vanished into thin air, leaving a long, bitter and bloody trail of conflict, political schism and sectarianism behind. Perhaps, instead of banqueting in Tel Aviv, Cairo and Riyadh, the president should be walking the streets of Baghdad, Gaza and Beirut. There, he will catch a glimpse of his &quot;new Middle East&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-17T14:00:00Z", "title": "End of term report", "sentences": ["Perhaps, instead of banqueting in Tel Aviv, Cairo and Riyadh, the president should be walking the streets of Baghdad, Gaza and Beirut."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/17/endoftermreport"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Cannes film festival", "Culture", "Thriller", "Romance", "Drama", "Cannes 2008", "Festivals"], "article": "Leading a conga line of Latin American talent into the 61st Cannes Film Festival was Fernando Meirelles&apos;s Blindness, opening a high-quality week with a very Cannes-like blend of style and pessimism. Its prominent slot - the opening film is not often included in competition as well - caps a remarkable rise for the Brazilian director, who first earned world recognition here on the Croisette when his kaleidoscopic favella film, City of God, screened in an unheralded sidebar slot six years ago. That success opened up the world for films, stars and directors from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina: at this Cannes, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n is on the jury, Walter Salles is in competition with Linha de Passe and he also acts as producer on Pablo Trapero&apos;s Lion&apos;s Den, of which more later. Blindness enhances Meirelles&apos;s reputation as a visual stylist. Working with cinematographer C\u00e9sar Charlone, the director creates unforgettable images of urban decay when a plague of blindness overtakes an unspecified metropolis, turning its people into savages, both noble and frenzied. Yet, the film asks, are they any more savage to each other than when they could see? The film works like an upmarket zombie thriller, with echoes of 28 Days Later and I Am Legend. But its parable elements, about the breakdown of society and the warring human urges for power, survival and kindness, are more haunting than in traditional horror movies. Meirelles infuses the carnage with humanism, teetering on the sentimental and pompous but never toppling in. Julianne Moore is strong as the only character who can see; Mark Ruffalo is better than usual as a doctor struggling with responsibility; and Gael Garcia Bernal is almost otherworldly as a crazed, self-crowned king, his and everyone else&apos;s blindness allowing the rise of a tiny despot. The achievement of Blindness is to surround the viewer in a sensory, entirely cinematic experience of sound, music, colours, violence and confusion, a Portinari canvas sprung to life. Israeli film Waltz With Bashir struck an even more impressive visual tone, and I can see it capturing awards a week from now. Following a recurring nightmare of 26 snarling dogs, a middle-aged Tel Aviv man delves into his past to discover what is haunting him. He pieces together his time in the Israeli army in 1982, when he was present during the massacres at the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in Lebanon. Director Ari Folman uses highly original graphic animation techniques to relay documentary-style confessions, hallucinations and reconstructions. It&apos;s a shattering war film, full of guilt and shock, and finding a new medium for expressing and exploring familiar themes. British artist Steve McQueen, a Turner prize winner, was given the opening night slot of the Un Certain Regard section here, traditionally a sidebar for more experimental work. His film Hunger chimed with both Blindness and Waltz With Bashir, even though it is set in the Maze prison&apos;s hellish H Block during the Troubles in Belfast in 1981, when inmates went on a &apos;blanket&apos; and &apos;dirty&apos; protest headed by Bobby Sands and leading to a hunger strike. The film is a British revelation. McQueen is a raw talent with an innate feel for the language of cinema. His recreation of prison cells covered in swirls of faeces could be nods to fellow YBAs Damien Hirst and Chris Ofili but McQueen&apos;s handling of the beatings and physical degradation of the prisoners is pure cinema, thrilling, disgusting, unremitting and visceral. Even more remarkable is how he follows this with a mid-section of eerie stillness given over to dialogue between a priest (Liam Cunningham) and Sands (Michael Fassbender, brilliant), and a final third charting Sands&apos;s slow death. Hunger escapes narrative convention and transcends politics to become a meditation on the human spirit. Another British talent unveiled was Duane Hopkins, whose debut Better Things unfolds in photographic compositions rather than dramatic scenes. It&apos;s a painful portrait of a fractured Cotswolds community, though not the one on the postcards. Hopkins&apos;s version is a world of teenage heroin addicts shooting up and driving too fast down country lanes, and sad, elderly folk staring out of windows. Using non-professional actors and unknown faces, the film&apos;s effect is gradual and numbing. Like Hunger, Argentinian film Lion&apos;s Den was another prison movie, but a very smart one, directed by Pablo Trapero and starring his wife Martina Gusman in a performance that establishes her as an early leader for Best Actress. She plays Julia, a pregnant woman perhaps wrongly incarcerated for a murder. The film follows her years in a wing for mothers and babies and her battle to keep her son Thomas inside with her. Trapero&apos;s battle is to keep clich\u00e9s at bay, and through subtle camerawork and Gusman&apos;s acting, this is grippingly managed. France made an early bid for its first Palme d&apos;Or in over 20 years with Arnaud Desplechin&apos;s witty, sad, sprawling family melodrama A Christmas Tale, which I greatly enjoyed. Catherine Deneuve is the materfamilias in need of a marrow transplant from her recalcitrant, alcoholic son played by Mathieu Amalric at his sparkling, neurotic best. This is a film of highs and lows, brilliance and pretentiousness, dealing with life and death, love and rejection, with music from Duke Ellington, Otis Redding and Charles Mingus. One of Cannes&apos;s darlings is Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, though his grumpy and taciturn films have never worked for me. His latest is Three Monkeys, shot in a dull sepia, about a family torn apart when a father, in return for payment, takes a spell in jail to cover up an accident involving his politician boss. Ceylan seems to hate all his characters. Away from the Monkeys and Lions was a premiere for a Kung Fu Panda, a simple but winning Dreamworks cartoon that regains some of the innocence lost during recent Shrek sequels. It will be adored by those with a high threshold for watching Jack Black&apos;s blubbery Panda fall over a lot as he tries to join an elite squad of martial artists under the Zen tuition of Dustin Hoffman as a little furry squirrelly thing. Cannes gossip Party town Guests at the opening night bash for Blindness on the Carlton Beach had to enter through a disorienting tunnel of white light and mist. It was in keeping with the visual effects used in the film and, once inside, several wags remarked that the film&apos;s themes continued: the food&apos;s running out and no one can find the toilets. Personally, I managed plenty of champagne and chatted to Alice Braga, Fernando Meirelles, Gillian Anderson, resplendent in an Alberta Ferretti gown, Michel Gondry and surprise guest soul/folk star Richie Havens, who stood resplendent against the moon in Magi-style gown and huge rings at the end of the pier. He&apos;d been flown in as &apos;a gift&apos; to Jury president Sean Penn, who is apparently one of Havens&apos;s biggest fans. Gilding the lily I fetched Lily Allen a drink at the celeb-tastic GQ party and congratulated her on her bright peroxide hair. &apos;I hate it,&apos; she said. &apos;I&apos;m changing it when I get back.&apos; I wondered if she features in the new film just announced by her new best friend James Corden? It was revealed last week that the one-time History Boy will be in Lesbian Vampire Killers. Said Lily: &apos;Brilliant, isn&apos;t it? James is so good. They haven&apos;t officially asked yet but I&apos;m definitely going to visit the set and shuffle on as a lesbian vampire whether they like it or not.&apos; Lily was with her dad, Keith Allen, and music producer Nellee Hooper, as well as a rather ungracious Mischa Barton who did a lot of BlackBerry work while I was talking to her. Also at the party, and celebrating the completion of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, was the film&apos;s star, Simon Pegg, enjoying his first Cannes. He made me take a photo of him with Morgan Spurlock. &apos;Super Smile me,&apos; I said. Natalie Imbruglia walked past, said she thought that was funny and handed me a large vodka. And adrenaline. She&apos;s lovely. Casting around Michael Fassbender has made a huge impression here with his performance as Bobby Sands in Steve McQueen&apos;s remarkable Hunger. Several executives have hailed him as the British Brando and the relative unknown has now been cast as Heathcliff in a new big-budget version of Wuthering Heights. John Maybury will direct the film; a shame that Natalie Portman, who&apos;s on the Jury this year, has now pulled out of playing Cathy. Russian roulette Some people will do anything to get buyers to see their film. Russian title Vanechka is offering its entire audience a bottle of vodka at its screening, plus automatic entry into a draw for prizes that include: a flight to Moscow for the Champions League final, a date with a Russian model and a tin of the world&apos;s most expensive caviar. The film, apparently, charts the rise of the oligarchs - none of whom would ever resort to tactics quite so brash.

A hogsticker. Forty of them arrived in a package from Greece. Ever received a package from overseas? You get that puff of air when you rip it open - air that&apos;s travelled thousands of miles. Foreign, like stepping into a stranger&apos;s house. The syringe wrapper has instructions in Italian, French, Greek and Arabic - not a word of English. But it&apos;s a needle. Operation is self-explanatory. I had put them out on my work desk a few days ago - an unignorable fact. An invitation. A threat. Buck up, laddie. Fortune favours the brave. What&apos;s inside looks like oily urine. 1cc of Equipoise - a veterinary drug normally injected into beef cattle - and 2cc of Testosterone Cypionate: 10 times the testosterone a man my size produces naturally in a week. It was going into my backside; plenty of meat there. But the sciatic nerve radiates from my hips; plus, if I hit a vein I could go into cardiac collapse. I tucked a bag of frozen corn beneath my underwear to numb the injection site. The hash marks on the syringe were smudged away by my sweaty hands. That couldn&apos;t be a sign of quality medical equipment, could it? What if I died in this shitty apartment in Iowa City? I pictured the landlord stumbling upon my body, rotten and bloated. The newspaper headline: Dumbshit Canadian Found Dead with Needle in Ass. The needle slid in so easily I wasn&apos;t aware it&apos;d broken the skin. I aspirated and injected into the deep tissue. When I pulled it out a pressurised stream of blood spurted halfway across the room. A while ago I wrote a novel. A lot of first-time novelists don&apos;t stray far from home: their stories are drawn from their lives. This holds true for me: the main character is... well, me. That&apos;s not quite true: he&apos;s wealthier, pampered, more intolerant and dismissive. But his deep-seated fears, his inborn weaknesses - those things we share intimately. My character goes down dark roads. For the sake of the book, I thought I&apos;d travel those roads with him. He begins to work out obsessively. I began to work out obsessively. He joins a boxing club. I joined a boxing club. He takes steroids. I took steroids. The thing is, I&apos;ve never done drugs, so I lacked the ability to spot the dealer in a room. Such was my quandary when it came to steroids. Where to buy? Who to ask? I&apos;d heard your local gym was a good place, but I didn&apos;t have a clue how to go about that. So I typed &apos;steroids&apos; into Google, which promptly introduced me to an internet scam. I bought a bottle of what I thought was a steroid called Dianabol. But what I received was Dianobol, which, for all I know, were rat turds pressed into pill form. I won&apos;t go into detail about how I came to possess real steroids - or &apos;gear&apos;, as we &apos;roiders call them. The whole thing makes me look as stupid as I was. Suffice to say, the process involved an encrypted email account, a money order wired to Tel Aviv, and weeks of apprehension (had I been ripped off? Would agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration break down my door?) before a package arrived - pill and ampules and six vials wrapped in X-ray-proof paper. Anabolic steroids hit US gyms in the early Sixties, courtesy of Dr John Ziegler, the American team doctor at the 1954 World Weightlifting Championships in Austria. He watched in horror as his athletes were decimated by a legion of hulking Soviet he-men who, he later found out, received testosterone injections as part of their training regime. Ziegler teamed up with a pharmaceutical firm to create the synthetic testosterone Methandrostenolone, better known by its trade name, Dianabol. The biological function of anabolic (tissue building) steroids like Dianabol is to stimulate protein synthesis - that is, to heal muscles more quickly and effectively. New muscle is gained by tearing the long, tube-like fibres that run the length of our muscle; protein molecules attach to the broken chains, creating new muscle. While on steroids, your muscle fibres become greedy, seeking out every stray protein molecule. At first nobody was willing to credit Ziegler&apos;s creation for the amazing gains glimpsed in the first test subjects. Nobody - not least the weightlifters themselves - could get their heads around the idea that a tiny pink pill could be responsible for their newfound strength: lifters added 30lb to their bench press and 50 to their hack squats virtually overnight. These lifters had been taking vitamins for years; they knew the value of pills was minimal. The only thing that convinced them was when Ziegler cut off the supply: the lifters surrendered all their gains and lost the feeling of euphoria experienced while on the programme. As the Sixties progressed and the results became known, steroids made their way from the hardcore weightlifting gyms of North America into mainstream society, trickling down into baseball clubhouses, Olympic training facilities, and health clubs. Though Dianabol is still perhaps the most popular, today&apos;s users can choose from over 40 steroids in the form of pills, patches, creams, and injectable compounds from A (Anavar) to W (Winstrol). Illegal unless prescribed, it is still estimated that one in every 100 people in North America have experimented with steroids at some point in their lives. I had a misconception that being &apos;on steroids&apos; involved the ingestion or injection of a single substance, but that was quickly dispelled. Many steroids on their own are either singular of purpose or not terribly effective. This is where &apos;stacking&apos; comes in: you can put on mass (75mg of testosterone), promote muscle hardness (50mg of Winstrol) and keep water retention to a minimum (50mg of Equipoise). This stack is injection-intensive: Testosterone and Equipoise twice weekly, Winstrol daily. Eleven injections a week. But that&apos;s only steroids - you need other drugs to stave off the potential side-effects, which include: hair loss, gynecomastia (build-up of breast tissue due to increased oestrogen, aka gyno; aka bitch tits), testicular atrophy, cranial and prostate swelling, erratic sex drive, liver impairment, haemorrhoids, impotence, cysts, acne, abscesses, renal failure. Hair loss, gyno and testicular atrophy should be considered absolute rather than potential hazards: you simply cannot expect to alter your body&apos;s chemical make-up without your body reacting. My own steroid cycle went as follows: Dianabol (10mg tabs, 3 per day for the first 4 weeks); Testosterone Cypionate (500mg per week, 10 weeks); Equipoise (400mg per week, 10 weeks); Nolvadex (anti-oestrogen drug; 1 to 4 pills daily, depending on week); Proviron (male menopause drug, 25mg daily); HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, which is derived from the urine of pregnant women; used during Post Cycle Therapy to restore natural testosterone levels - 500iu twice weekly, administered with an insulin needle). Believe it or not, it&apos;s a fairly mild cycle. Including diuretics and cutting and hardening agents, professional bodybuilders may have 10-15 substances floating around their system at any given time. Like alcohol or drugs, a body&apos;s tolerance builds up over time; top pros need to inject 2,500mg of Testosterone or more, weekly, to receive any effect. Three days into the cycle, my nipples began to itch: onset of Gynomastia. Dump enough testosterone into your body and your system counters by upping its oestrogen output, which leads to a build-up of breast tissue. After long-term use, it can get so bad that some users require surgical breast reductions. I woke up on the morning of day four and nearly had a heart attack at the sight of myself in the mirror. My nipples were the size of milk bottle tops, stretched smooth as the skin of a balloon. The skin had formed into swollen pouches that looked like the rubberised nipples on a baby&apos;s bottle. I appeared to have breasts. Pendulous, malformed breasts. Or was I just chubby and still out of shape? I didn&apos;t know. I gave them a jiggle. I couldn&apos;t tell if it was fluid build-up or actual flesh. Could a person grow new flesh overnight? I didn&apos;t want tits - it went against the purpose of the exercise. I gobbled twice my daily allotment of anti-oestrogen medication. A week&apos;s worth of double Nolvadex doses got the gyno under control. But by then my hair had started falling out. I have a scalp of unruly, bushman-like red hair. While I&apos;ve never been keen on the colour and its tendency to coil into ringlets when grown out, there has always been plenty of it. Then one morning I was showering, I looked down at my shampoo-foamed hands, and saw dozens of red strands between my fingers. Soon they were everywhere: on my pillow, between my teeth, falling into the pages of books while I read. I became hyper-aware of the way wind felt through my hair: colder on the top of my skull, where there was less protection. And not just my head: the hairs on my arms and legs, even my testicles, were falling out. Not a single follicle seemed firmly moored to my skin. Then, one sleepless night (the steroids also triggered insomnia) my testicles shrunk. Testicular atrophy is the most well-known side-effect of steroid abuse. It&apos;s an inherent irony: here you are trying to turn yourself into an \u00fcber-man while part of the most obvious manifestation of your manhood dwindles before your eyes. Female users suffer the opposite reaction: their clitorises become so swollen and hard that, in extreme cases, they resemble a tiny penis. Basically, you pump so much testosterone into your system that you rob your gonads of purpose, they lie dormant for the duration of your steroid cycle. And while I knew this would happen, the physical sensation was beyond horrible. I felt this rude clenching inside my scrotum, like a pair of tiny hands had grasped the spermatic cords and tightened into fists. It happened that fast - like a door slammed shut. &apos;No more testosterone!&apos; my gonads cried. &apos;Closed for business!&apos; I sat up, gasping, clutching my testicles to make sure they were still there. In a few days time they had shrunk to half their normal size: plump ripe grapes. Another sleepless night, a week later, I felt a ridge on my forehead. Cranial swelling - most often a neanderthal-like ridge forming above the brow - is commonly associated with the steroid HGH, or Human Growth Hormone, originally made from the crushed pituitary glands of fresh cadavers. But cranial swelling assumes many forms: in addition to &apos;caveman brow&apos;, some users find semi-solid lumps forming on their foreheads. Some lumps grow to the size of hard-boiled eggs, at which point they require surgical removal. The next morning, an inspection in the bathroom: was that a slight swelling across the top of my eyebrows? It seemed impossible - this only happens in extreme cases. My own perceived bulge wasn&apos;t altogether solid, sort of mushy, but as I smoothed my fingers across my forehead I had this terrifying sense that my bone structure had been somehow altered. This was the primary fear I ran up against: were these changes happening, and would they subside once I quit &apos;roiding, or were they permanent? I could handle rampant hair loss, a caveman head, shrunken testicles, hell, even tits - so long as it was temporary. But what if it wasn&apos;t? My sixth injection goes badly. I&apos;ve been shooting my gluteus and while it&apos;s relatively painless the skin has gone tight and I&apos;m thinking the oil hasn&apos;t quite dissolved. I elect to stick it in my thigh instead. I get the needle in three-quarters of an inch before I hit a major nerve. My leg bucks uncontrollably, knee nearly striking my forehead. It takes a few minutes for the pain to subside. Blood leaks from the puncture wound down my leg. I decide I&apos;m not a fan of thigh injections. So I try my calf. Sitting cross-legged, ankle propped on knee, I push the needle in. It goes in easy enough but when I aspirate the syringe fills with blood: I&apos;ve hit a vein. I wipe the needle with rubbing alcohol and try another spot: again, blood. I boot the excess onto a paper towel, plug a fresh needle onto the syringe, and try again: more blood. It is coming out of my thigh and now from a triangle of holes in my calf. What, am I all veins? I end up back at my glutes. But I soon regret it: I feel a perfect bubble of oil the size of a pearl onion an inch under my skin. When I massage it the bubble wobbles under my fingertips, all of one piece. It&apos;s still there come night time: in bed, I roll onto my side and feel it pressed against my hipbone, solid as a ball bearing. Like the princess with a pea, I have a hard time sleeping. To embark on a steroid cycle is to devote yourself to rituals. Wake up, eat, medicate, work out, eat, work out, eat, medicate, sleep. Repeat daily for 16 weeks. Eating becomes a ritual. To maximise muscle growth you must eat one gram of protein for each pound of your weight per day. But I pushed my target further, to around 1.5g of protein per pound - or 337.5g daily. Consider that a great source of natural protein - a can of tuna - has 13g of protein. That means I&apos;d have to eat 25 cans a day. The most I ever managed was 20, forking it straight from the can. Please believe me when I tell you it is sheer lunacy to eat 20 cans of tuna. Eventually I settle on six cans a day, supplemented with five to six protein shakes. I go through four 2.4lb tubs of protein powder a week, 158lb in all. I keep shovelling a limited range of foodstuffs - tuna, bananas, egg whites, boiled chicken breasts - into my mouth with the listless motions of an automaton. Thankfully the Equipoise, developed to increase lean body weight appetite in horses, gives my appetite a much-needed boost. Injections become a ritual. Run the vials under hot water to warm the oil. Unwrap a fresh syringe. Draw 1cc Equipoise, followed by 1.5cc Testosterone. Tap the syringe to release air bubbles, push the plunger until a tiny bead forms at the pin-tip. Swab the injection site with alcohol and inject s-l-o-o-o-w, massaging so the oil soaks in. It isn&apos;t much different from the way a heroin addict goes about things: mix the drugs, prepare the needle, find a clean injection site. I reached a point where the careful steps and resultant anticipation became as heady as the rush itself. Those last few weeks, I couldn&apos;t stop shaking as I prepared the needle. The workout becomes a ritual. If the gym is a temple of the body, I went from casual worshipper to fanatical zealot. I pushed myself and found I possessed limits beyond all reckoning. But I&apos;d push myself past the limit, too - twice I caught the smell of ozone, saw awful stars flitting before my eyes, and came to sprawled on the gym carpet. I&apos;d lift until my arms hung like dead things from my shoulders. I took post-workout naps in the changing room, spread out on a bench, too exhausted to walk home. The prostate is an organ I associate with old men. Surgical-gloved fingers. Not, in any way, an organ I should be aware of. And yet I was, because the benign little organ had swollen to the point where it felt like a fist-sized balloon pressed against my testicles. This is a fairly common side-effect; some professional bodybuilders get prostatitis to such an extent they require a catheter. I was urinating 15 times a day. A swollen prostate cramps the urethral tube, making it torture to pee. It also presses against the bladder, making it feel as if you always need to pee, even if there&apos;s nothing to pass: I stood over the toilet for five minutes, coaxing, cajoling, only to produce a squirt. My urine took on a disturbingly rich hue, like cask-aged brandy. I heard that &apos;vigorous manual relief&apos; helped ease prostate pain. But when I tried this, it felt as though the pipe connecting the sperm factory to its exit had been clothes-pegged: nothing much comes out, and the little that does looks embarrassed to be there. The key was continual application. I became obsessed with manual relief. Four times a day I was manually relieving myself. All that testosterone in my system, it didn&apos;t take much to get the motor humming. I was relieving myself to photos of muscle-bound woman gracing tubs of protein powder. I even relieved myself to a perfume sample in a magazine; I relieved myself to a smell - vigorously so! Wake up, eat, jerk off, work out, eat, jerk off, eat, work out, eat, jerk off, eat, sleep. The question most sane readers will be asking by this point is: why didn&apos;t he stop? Why, despite all the awful side-effects, did he keep plugging needles into himself? I&apos;m sure my answer is no different to that given by most steroid users: the results. Once we pass that period of massive physical change - childhood through our teens, puberty and growth spurts - we settle into a sense of our bodies. We understand the parameters and capabilities, what it can and cannot do. And though it&apos;s disheartening to say, at 30, I was already finding evidence of a body on its downslope. While I worked out regularly, I hadn&apos;t made a sizeable gain in years. In gym parlance, I&apos;d &apos;hit the plateau&apos;. Steroids shattered the limitations of my body. I first sensed their effects while bench-pressing dumbbells. I usually peak at 85lb each, or 170lb total. But after 10 repetitions with the 85s I was stunned: it felt like a warm-up! With a degree of trepidation - we&apos;re talking weights that, if mishandled, could break a wrist or some ribs - I picked up the 90-pounders, which I&apos;d never attempted. They went up easily and I ripped out 10 reps. It was an out-of-body sensation: somebody else&apos;s arms were pushing those weights, someone else&apos;s pectorals flexing and contracting. I went up to 100lb dumbbells - benching roughly my own body weight. I&apos;d been locked at 160-170lb for two years and now, in the course of a single workout, I&apos;d shot up 30lb. My workout weights rocketed across the board. I was doing wide-grip chin-ups with a 35lb plate strapped to my waist; shoulder-pressing 75lb dumbbells; slapping 45lb plates on the biceps bar to curl 115lb. I was bottoming out Nautilus machines, lifting their maximum weights. My body exploded, 205lb to 235lb in the space of a few weeks - in &apos;roider vernacular I&apos;d &apos;swallowed the air hose&apos;. I became a huffer, a puffer, a grunter, a screamer. Anyone who frequents gyms has seen those guys who make ungodly noises while throwing huge masses of weight around. I&apos;d always found these displays childish and tended to look away, as I would from a toddler having a tantrum in a supermarket. So imagine my surprise to find myself bellowing, shrieking and groaning. It was like a silverback gorilla&apos;s mating ritual: I wanted to be seen lifting, wanted everyone to know I was the biggest, toughest motherfucker in the gym. &apos;Hoooo-aaahhh!&apos; &apos;Eeeeeee-yahhh!&apos; Look at me! I&apos;m a big boy! It was pathetic and I should have known better - actually I did know better, but I didn&apos;t let that stop me. The &apos;pumps&apos; I&apos;d get after a workout clouded all judgment. My glances at the gym mirrors were at first baffled: &apos;Is that me?&apos; double-takes that soon mutated into looks of preening narcissism. I noticed how light played differently upon my chest and arms, the pockets of blue shadow filling my new contours. The thing is, I knew it was all fake. I hadn&apos;t earned it; it was actually quite freakish. But it&apos;s like a woman with giant fake breasts: everyone knows they&apos;re fake, but damn it if they don&apos;t still draw attention. That oil I shot into my hip weeks ago had not dissolved. The deep pain convinced me I&apos;d developed an abscess. In effect, I&apos;ve got a pouch of month-old oil inside my hip, walled off by my immune system. If I&apos;m lucky it&apos;s sterile, but if not it is infected, the surrounding tissue gone necrotic. I decide to drain it myself by injecting an empty needle and drawing out the stale oil. My hope is it&apos;s still liquid; if it&apos;s congealed and lard-like, I&apos;ll need medical attention. The needle sunk into the pocket of infected tissue. The pain was expected and surprisingly bearable. I drew back the plunger and got only a few drops of clear broth. I disconnected the syringe and left the needle jutting out, applying pressure to the surrounding skin. Blood so dark it was almost black dripped down my thigh. Disgusting and more than a little scary, but the pressure subsided. When I&apos;d squeezed as much out as I could, I filled another syringe with sterile water, attached it to the needle still stuck in my skin, injected it, then unclipped the syringe and squeezed most of the water out. I figured it was a decent job for an untrained meatball like myself. And it did the trick: a week later I was sleeping on my side again. Week 12, I peak at 240lb. I&apos;ve packed on 35lb in less than four months. My body has gone through an extreme thickening process. My pectoral muscles are solid slabs of meat hung off my clavicles. My latissimus dorsi muscles flare out from the midpoint of my back: what bodybuilders call a &apos;cobra&apos;s hood&apos;. My triceps and biceps have swollen so much my T-shirt sleeves bunch up at my shoulders, too narrow to fit over my arms. But the list of physical ailments is mounting. Chronic back pain has set in. I can&apos;t walk more than a few blocks before what feels like a fist-sized stone settles upon my lower back. My flexibility has vanished. There are areas I can not reach due to my new size; if I want to scratch my neck I have to go to the cutlery drawer for a fork. One night I was watching a legal drama on TV - one of those &apos;ripped from the headlines&apos; type shows. A morbidly obese man was suing a snack company, whom he held responsible for his obesity. It was revealed that the main ingredient in the snack was high fructose corn syrup, a compound that inhibited the hormone leptin, whose function is to send a signal to the brain that the stomach is full - essentially, leptin tells us when to stop eating. But if this signal is never received, a person will go on eating past the point of reason. Steroids are like high fructose corn syrup. Essentially, they fool a body into a sense that it is stronger and more resilient than it truly is. You accomplish feats that, in your heart and mind, you know are beyond your capacities - and yet you feel so good, so strong, that you convince yourself otherwise. But afterwards it is impossible to deny the toll these exertions have taken on you. After a workout my joints felt like they were hyper-extended. They popped and cracked, noises like wheel nuts rattling in a cement mixer. I felt calcified, hardened, and frighteningly old. My cycle ends. I&apos;ve swallowed every anti-oestrogen pill, injected every cc of Testosterone, Equipoise and HGC. By my best estimate, I&apos;ve eaten 560 cans of tuna, over $750 worth. $1,280 on protein powder. The steroids themselves cost $600. One morning I wake up and everything has changed. The first thing I notice upon waking is that I feel... well, good. No sluggishness, only minor joint pain. Genuinely refreshed. Then, on my way to the bathroom, I sense a new weight between my legs - my testicles! Fellas, where have you been? Great to have you back, boyos! The feeling of elation lasts exactly 10 paces: the distance from my bed to the bathroom mirror. I&apos;m staring at a human boneyard. Where are my pecs? I see two shrivelled bags hanging off my chest. My arms - dear lord, my arms! Shapeless shoestrings dangling from a pair of rotten-apple shoulders. My stomach looks like a deflated clown balloon. My legs belong to a coma victim. I step on the scale: 222lb! I&apos;ve shed 13lb overnight. Now I realise only the most deluded of 222lb men can stare into a mirror and see a skeletal horror staring back. But I&apos;d become so used to my new body that I felt like a scarecrow with a tear in its belly, bleeding its stuffing all over a farmer&apos;s field. The fact that I&apos;d packed on 12lb of raw muscle over four months, that my testicles were up and running again, that I&apos;d woken up feeling better than I had in months - all of this was erased by what I&apos;d lost. It got worse once I hit the gym. Chest day, which meant dumbbell bench presses. I didn&apos;t even attempt to pick up the 105-pounders, which I&apos;d been maxing out with. I settled on the 90s; if I could lift them, it&apos;d be a 20lb increase over my pre-cycle max. I could barely get the things off my chest. I struggled through a single rep, arms quaking, and halfway through the second the dumbbells crashed down and I rolled awkwardly off the bench, barking my elbows. I felt like a total fraud. Everyone who&apos;d been watching me the past few months as I heaved massive weight about, bellowing like a steer in rut - all these knowing eyes now saw me as a charlatan. I&apos;d lost it. Everything I&apos;d gained had been washed away. Popeye without his spinach. Weak and broken and utterly human. All the needles, the gallons of protein I&apos;d chugged, pound after pound of tuna, the urine of pregnant women running through my veins, the fainting spells and sleepless nights, the muscle knots and bitch tits and shrunken gonads and the hair in my food and abscesses and caveman brow - every risk I&apos;d taken, all that sweat and toil for nothing. I fell into a week-long funk. I cleaned my apartment out: the unopened cans of tuna, the uneaten protein powder - all of it went in the bin. I ordered a large pizza, pepperoni and double cheese. I wolfed it down with gulps of Pepsi. I wanted to get fat and disgusting. I wanted to inflict damage upon myself. The rational part of my mind was going, &apos;You did the research - you knew this was bound to happen.&apos; But the other part of my mind - the part closer to my body, the part now accustomed to the sly weightroom looks and the more defined, somehow burlier cast of my shadow, the part that relished how people ceded plenty of room as they passed me on the city&apos;s narrow pavements - that part of me was not to be consoled. I headed to the doctor&apos;s. Though I felt much better now that it was over, I was still suffering aches and pains. The results: a partially herniated disc in my lower spine, the result of either bad posture or an accumulation of pressure due to excess body weight. A chiropractic visit was scheduled. An enlarged prostate. I was prescribed Avodart, which worked wonders.Fluid build-up on left knee - again, the result of excess weight. The doctor told me he&apos;d get back to me with the blood test results. I started out weighing 205lb and ended up at 208. My body looks no better now - if anything, it&apos;s worse. Bloated somehow, like I&apos;d died, my body abandoned in a gassy swamp. The gyno has left nipple-nubbins that poke out when I wear anything tighter than a golf shirt. Has it been worth it? The question presupposes that I expected to benefit from the experience. I embarked on the steroid cycle in order to bring a level of real-world verisimilitude to my novel. I wanted to feel what my character felt, experience a portion of his life, write with conviction about what he went through. In a way, I am ashamed of myself. Was it worth it - all for a book? What have I done to myself in the long run? Jeopardised my chances of having a child, perhaps. I worry about that a lot. More than anything else. Has it been worth it? Somewhere along the line I&apos;d been let off the hook. My grandfather, father, uncles, men of generations past - they didn&apos;t get the free pass I did. Their lives were about poverty, warts, factory floors, untilled fields. They endured. What have I ever had to endure? I felt unworthy of all I&apos;d been so carelessly given. And I loathed myself for taking it. I currently weigh 170lb. The blood tests showed my liver values were totally out of whack. As I had never been able to convince a woman that I was a viable prospect to make a baby with before, I&apos;ll never know if an inability to conceive, should that be the case, is attributable to steroids or the innate decrepitude of my seed. Did I take steroids to write a book, or did I write a book as an excuse to take steroids? Often, all you want is to step off the path you&apos;ve carved. And when my body began to fall apart, when the drugs began to destroy me, I persisted in the belief that all suffering on my part was long overdue. I would endure. The eventual understanding that a certain nobility underlay my grandfather&apos;s suffering, whereas mine was not much more than a masochistic stubbornness - I&apos;d like to think that stopped me. And when I&apos;d stared at myself, naked and porcine, in the bathroom mirror, I told myself that if nothing else, I had suffered. I&apos;m ashamed to admit, I took pride in that too. &apos;Mr Davidson,&apos; the doctor asked over the phone, &apos;are you on any herbal medications or&apos; - a pause - &apos;bodybuilding supplements?&apos; &apos;I was on creatine,&apos; I told him, creatine being a legal bodybuilding supplement. &apos;Mr Davidson.&apos; Another pause, followed by a heavy exhale. &apos;Never, ever take creatine again.&apos; The doctor hung up on me. \u00b7 The Fighter by Craig Davidson is published by Picador on 6 June.

Suppose, for a minute, it was not Roman Abramovich who bought Chelsea five years ago but Dermot Desmond, the Cork-born billionaire and football investor. Then imagine that, after sacking Jose Mourinho, the new owner hired a distinctly uncharismatic middle-aged Irishman who had never coached at club level outside the League of Ireland, had spent four years unsuccessfully attempting to take the Republic to the finals of major tournaments and had arrived in England some months earlier through a mysterious link with Desmond&apos;s friend, compatriot and fellow billionaire John Magnier. The prevailing scepticism would have been every bit as intense. So Avram Grant&apos;s friend and agent Pini Zahavi was wrong to claim, in a widely publicised interview with an Israeli newspaper a fortnight ago, that the recent criticisms of his client&apos;s performance as the manager of Chelsea FC were motivated by an atavistic dislike of his ethnic origins. What aroused the suspicion of the English football media and public was not the Jewishness of the man born Avraham Granat but the absence in his background of anything suggesting that he was qualified to coach a team of Chelsea&apos;s standing and ambition, a belief confirmed to many by six months in which it has been hard to work out what he actually does.  Were Grant to start next season with a touchline ban as a result of his comments on English referees last week, would his absence make any difference? By contrast with the theatrical Mourinho - or Sir Alex Ferguson, Rafa Ben\u00edtez or even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger - the 53-year-old Israeli appears reluctant to react to moments of crisis during a match. When he rises to his feet, he tends to do little more than stand in the technical area, shoulders hunched, arms held out from his sides like a man waiting for his hands to dry. Meanwhile his assistants, Henk ten Cate and Steve Clarke, get on with the job of making tactical adjustments and preparing substitutions. There is more than one approach to coaching, as Real Madrid learnt to their cost five years ago after sacking the similarly unflashy Vicente del Bosque. &quot;A manager&apos;s job is to think all the time,&quot; Grant said last week. &quot;Then you need to be calm. You can&apos;t follow the situation, not in the game. The job is to do the right thing and, when things go wrong, to correct them. I have to be calm most of the time.&quot; The statistics, as well as Chelsea&apos;s place in this week&apos;s European Cup final, are on his side. When he stepped up from the role of director of football on September 20 last year, he was taking over a team who had made an unconvincing start in both the Premier League and the Champions League. The improvement in their fortunes may have been gradual but it left them as Manchester United&apos;s only credible challengers in the two major competitions. In the debit column are several important goals conceded in the final seconds of matches - a trait which would have sent Mourinho wild - and a general feeling that their tactics lack inspiration. Not until the result is known late on Wednesday night, then, will anyone be able to say whether Grant&apos;s season has been a success or a failure and whether he will still be in his post at the start of next season. Although he has a four-year contract, none of the club&apos;s senior executives has been willing to issue a ringing endorsement of his stewardship. Even Abramovich seems unconvinced. The owner was in Russia attending to political issues while the season was reaching its climax, returning only for the damp squib of a draw with Bolton Wanderers on the final weekend at Stamford Bridge. By missing the defeat of Liverpool en route to the European Cup final, and a home victory over Manchester United in the league, Abramovich denied himself a sight of the sort of performances for which he must have been hoping. Even then, however, there were plenty of people saying that the team had taken matters into their own hands and were doing it for themselves, not for Grant. The players&apos; reaction has been mixed. John Terry and Frank Lampard, representing the team&apos;s public face, are standing squarely behind the manager in the build-up to the most important match in the club&apos;s history. Didier Drogba, by contrast, makes plain his indifference to the replacement for his adored Mourinho, whom he may follow - perhaps along with Ricardo Carvalho - to Italy next season. Michael Ballack and Joe Cole have both been granted the permanent places in the starting line-up denied them by the previous regime but, while one has rediscovered his form, the other has mislaid it. Salomon Kalou, competing with Florent Malouda for a place on the left of the three-man attack, gave the official line last week. &quot;I think Avram Grant did great,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s managed to come in and get us to the final and be fighting for the title to the last game. So that&apos;s a great season. It wasn&apos;t easy for him, with all the criticism, but he managed to stay calm. Next season? That&apos;s not my decision but I&apos;d be happy to see him stay.&quot; According to the Ivorian, Grant has not made many changes to the structures of training and preparation established by Mourinho. &quot;It&apos;s not so much different. It would be difficult to change everything in eight months. He&apos;s brought his own personal touch but the routines are still almost exactly the same.&quot; Mourinho left no one in doubt about his hands-on style and saw no need to conceal the outlines of what he called his &quot;methodology&quot;. Asked how he had prepared his Porto players for their European Cup victory in 2004, he told the media: &quot;On Friday we practised defending. On Saturday we practised attacking. On Sunday we practised the transition from attack to defence. On Monday we practised the transition from defence to attack. And on Tuesday we practised set pieces.&quot;  By comparison Grant&apos;s opaque utterances tend to frustrate his listeners. How, he was asked last week, had he modified or improved the preparation routines that had been in place when he took over? &quot;I will not speak about the past,&quot; he said. &quot;From the day I was here, three days after we drew at home to Rosenborg, our main target was to get to the final of the Champions League and improve our game. We did those two things. Next year it will be better, I hope. There are things that have changed. But when you come in the middle of a season you don&apos;t want to come in like an elephant and break everything. There were good things we kept, and other things that I&apos;m not saying weren&apos;t good but that we needed to change because of the vision of the club.&quot; Many who observed him during the 3\u00bd decades of his coaching career in Israel question his ability to deliver the kind of football Abramovich seemed to be after when he ushered Mourinho out of Stamford Bridge last September. Grant&apos;s reputation as a defensively minded coach, established during spells with Hapoel Petah Tikva, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Haifa, was confirmed during his four-year stint with Israel&apos;s national team, with whom he failed to qualify for Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup despite bringing in a group of talented young players, notably Yossi Benayoun. &quot;They finished third in the qualifying group both times,&quot; Sharon Halabi, an Israeli football agent, noted. &quot;In the 2006 qualifiers they didn&apos;t lose a match but they still didn&apos;t qualify. In Israel he&apos;s known for putting out boring teams - most people don&apos;t like him. They know he&apos;s a good coach but there are many better ones. But connections are part of the game and he always knew how to be in the right place at the right time.&quot; Grant&apos;s &quot;connections&quot; have served him well. Questions have always surrounded his return to Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1991, which followed the unexplained sacking of Dror Kashtan, who had just won a league and cup double with the club. Four years later, having failed to win anything, Grant moved to Maccabi Haifa, where Zahavi was a close friend of the owner, Ya&apos;acov Shahar. A championship with a club that had been going through a long barren spell was enough to bring him the job with the national team. After the World Cup qualifying campaign he stepped down and was rumoured to be taking over at Beitar Jerusalem until the fans made their disapproval plain to the owner, the Russian-born businessman Arkady Gaydamak, but Zahavi&apos;s links with the Gaydamak family saw Grant quickly installed as technical director at Portsmouth, owned by Arkady&apos;s son Alexandre. Few members of staff at Fratton Park seemed to understand his role and, when he moved on to Chelsea last summer, amid rumours that he was being lined up to replace Mourinho, some observers saw him as a beneficiary of a new axis of football power running from Moscow through Tel Aviv to London. &quot;Grant was close to Abramovich,&quot; Ronny Rosenthal, the former Liverpool and Israel forward, now a London-based football consultant, said, &quot;and it was a decision Abramovich could afford to make. Usually, when you make an appointment, you check that someone&apos;s references are satisfactory. That&apos;s what happened when he appointed Mourinho. This time, no. But, after all, what does Chelsea represent in terms of Abramovich&apos;s fortune? Two or three per cent, maybe? With that, you can play. If it were 50%, no.&quot; We know a little more about Grant the man than we did six months ago, thanks to interviews in which he has spoken of his family&apos;s ordeals at the hands of the Nazis and to the pictures of his recent visit to Auschwitz, where he delivered a speech to the annual March of the Living. The coach, however, remains an enigma. &quot;He&apos;s not a genius,&quot; an Israeli friend of Grant said, asking not to be identified. &quot;He&apos;s made some very good decisions in the past and some very bad ones. But always he wanted to study and he&apos;s never stopped. Ask him about any match from the last 20 or 30 years, or about any player, and he knows it all. And he&apos;s special in the business of managing players and getting the best out of them. He&apos;s very intelligent and he knows how to talk to them in a nice way. He would never shout. He&apos;s very, very calm. At the end of the day, the result is the only way to show success in football. And so far he&apos;s done very well.&quot; On Wednesday, confronted by an adversary who has dominated English football for 15 years and who knows what it takes to win this most demanding of club competitions, the big test will come. If Chelsea win, some will claim that the players did it. If they lose, it will be through Grant&apos;s blundering. But in the heat of the Luzhniki Stadium, one or two seemingly small decisions may finally tell us whether Avram Grant is a global mastermind or a provincial mediocrity - or, as seems more likely, something in between.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-19T00:12:35Z", "title": "Grant powers Chelsea on enigma rather than charisma", "sentences": ["Grant&apos;s reputation as a defensively minded coach, established during spells with Hapoel Petah Tikva, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Haifa, was confirmed during his four-year stint with Israel&apos;s national team, with whom he failed to qualify for Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup despite bringing in a group of talented young players, notably Yossi Benayoun.", "Questions have always surrounded his return to Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1991, which followed the unexplained sacking of Dror Kashtan, who had just won a league and cup double with the club.", "Few members of staff at Fratton Park seemed to understand his role and, when he moved on to Chelsea last summer, amid rumours that he was being lined up to replace Mourinho, some observers saw him as a beneficiary of a new axis of football power running from Moscow through Tel Aviv to London."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/19/championsleague.chelsea2"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "China", "Sudan", "Religion", "Judaism", "Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of Noam, a British Zionist youth movement of which I was a member from its inception. Under the umbrella of the Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, Noam has flourished over the years to become one of the largest Jewish youth organisations, and has taken a markedly different path from the more traditional Zionist youth movements. Whilst promoting Zionism is high on its agenda, it also puts much emphasis on the concept of tikun olam (literally, &quot;repairing the world&quot;), which has led to some extraordinary offshoot projects undertaken by its alumni. One such scheme was the Tibetan Jewish youth exchange (TJYE), set up to forge links between Jewish and Tibetan youth groups and to provide support to each other in their respective endeavours. Since 2000, there has been a steady stream of Noam volunteers heading off to the Indian town of Dharamsala, to work with the exiled Tibetan youths and help empower them in their struggle to achieve independence for their people. Noam graduates were also instrumental in founding an Aids educations programme for street children in Nairobi, applying the values inculcated in them by their Noam leaders back home to a situation that cried out for experienced youth workers. Over the last few years, there has been a mass influx of ex-Noam members to Israel, myself included, which is testament to the power of the Zionist message we were taught during our formative years in the movement. However, rather than rest on our laurels and ignore our responsibilities to fulfilling tikun olam, we feel a collective responsibility to continue promoting the core Noam principles with which we grew up. One recent immigrant, Naomi Magnus, has been working with the Darfurian refugees living in Tel Aviv, whom I wrote about in March. Less than two months since I met them, their economic and social situation has deteriorated markedly, and many are now struggling even to pay the rent for the meagre shelters in which they live. Naomi, along with three other Noam olim, decided to take action on their behalf and organise a fundraising event which would draw on all the resources to which the Noam network had access. To that end, they have established an NGO, Israel Activists, which would undertake to assist worthy causes across the country, such as the Darfurian refugees. Their inaugural event is a two-day hike in the north of Israel at the end of May. Over 80 participants have already signed up, each committed to raising a minimum of $200, which will provide a massive shot in the arm for the refugees and their families and which will go a long way to prevent their eviction from their homes. At the same time, Israel Activists hopes to use the hike as the launching pad for a far wider series of activities, including three-month activism programmes for British students spending their gap year in Israel. Whilst most year-course participants are only exposed to a saccharine, Jewish-focused side of Israel and its society, there is a need to open the students eyes to the darker side of life in the Holy Land, according to Nic Schlagman, one of the founders of Israel Activists.  &quot;We want to work with any sector of Israeli society that is in need, be they Jewish, Arab, Druze, Bedouin or anyone else. It is imperative to provide the students with the necessary skills, motivation and experiences to help them continue their activism after their year in Israel - whether back home at British universities, here in Israel if they make aliyah, or anywhere else around the world. We believe in bringing contemporary Israeli societal issues to the awareness of young people, in order to create activists who are eager to effect change. Our mission is therefore twofold; firstly to raise awareness, and secondly to provide opportunities to make an impact.&quot;  Momentum is building behind the scheme, mirroring a sea change which has come over British Jewish philanthropy in recent years regarding the projects in Israel they view as most worthy of their support. The Pears Foundation - a prominent charitable organisation established by the Pears brothers, three British-Jewish property tycoons - has poured large amounts of money into causes assisting Israeli-Arab communities and fostering Jewish-Arab relations. Similarly, the first Magen David Adom-funded medical station in an Arab village opened last year, with the bulk of the donations coming from a group of Jewish philanthropists from England. Tikun olam is increasingly being recognised by donors as not only a practical way to apply the values of Judaism in general, but more specifically a means of demonstrating to the non-Jewish citizens of Israel that they are supported in their struggles by Jews and Zionists alike and regardless of what they, the recipients, might otherwise have believed. So it is with Israel Activists which, by taking on the cause of the Muslim refugees from Darfur, is following one of the central tenets of Judaism: &quot;Love thy neighbour as thyself&quot;. All who take part in the hike, as well as all who support it financially from the Jewish community back home, are helping to redress the image of Zionists as caring merely about themselves and their own people&apos;s situation. Once the activism programmes begin in earnest over the coming year, the potential for building bridges and establishing links between groups of young Jewish and Arab students will increase exponentially. The larger the group gets, and the more financial support it receives from the Jewish community in Britain, the more efforts can be devoted to breaking down the walls of silence that exist between the various sectors of society in Israel. And, when that happens, it will prove that Noam&apos;s joint principles of Zionism and tikun olam are by no means mutually exclusive, and that its members are applying those principles in a way which can only enhance the prospects of peace in the region.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-19T09:00:00Z", "title": "Repairing the world", "sentences": ["One recent immigrant, Naomi Magnus, has been working with the Darfurian refugees living in Tel Aviv, whom I wrote about in March."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/19/repairingtheworld"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Norman Finkelstein, the controversial Jewish American academic and fierce critic of Israel, has been deported from the country and banned from the Jewish state for 10 years, it emerged yesterday. Finkelstein, the son of a Holocaust survivor who has accused Israel of using the genocidal Nazi campaign against Jews to justify its actions against the Palestinians, was detained by the Israeli security service, Shin Bet, when he landed at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport on Friday. Shin Bet interrogated him for around 24 hours about his contact with the Lebanese Islamic militia, Hizbullah, when he travelled to Lebanon earlier this year and expressed solidarity with the group which waged war against Israel in 2006. He was also accused of having contact with al-Qaida. But Finkelstein rejected the accusations, saying he had travelled to Israel to visit an old friend.  &quot;I did my best to provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me,&quot; he told an Israeli newspaper in an email exchange.  &quot;I am confident that I have nothing to hide. Apart from my political views, and the supporting scholarship, there isn&apos;t much more to say for myself: alas, no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organisations. I&apos;ve always supported a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. I&apos;m not an enemy of Israel.&quot; Finkelstein is one of several scholars rejected by Israel in the increasingly bitter divide in academic circles, between those who support and those who criticise its treatment of Palestinians. Last year, Israel&apos;s most contentious &quot;new historian&quot;, Ilan Pappe, left his job as senior lecturer in political science at the University of Haifa after he endorsed the international academic boycott of Israeli institutions, provoking the university president to call for his resignation. Finkelstein was also refused tenure last year at Chicago&apos;s DePaul University for attacking several staunch Israel supporters and academics such as Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel said the deportation of Finkelstein was an assault on free speech.  &quot;The decision to prevent someone from voicing their opinions by arresting and deporting them is typical of a totalitarian regime,&quot; said the association&apos;s lawyer, Oded Peler.  &quot;A democratic state, where freedom of expression is the highest principle, does not shut out criticism or ideas just because they are uncomfortable for its authorities to hear. It confronts those ideas in public debate.&quot; Finkelstein said he was held in a cell and encountered &quot;several unpleasant moments with the guards&quot; and that eventually he borrowed the mobile phone of another detainee and called a friend who in turn called a lawyer. Although entitled to appeal against the entry ban, Finkelstein said he would not contest it.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "US academic deported and banned for criticising Israel", "sentences": ["Finkelstein, the son of a Holocaust survivor who has accused Israel of using the genocidal Nazi campaign against Jews to justify its actions against the Palestinians, was detained by the Israeli security service, Shin Bet, when he landed at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport on Friday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/26/israelandthepalestinians.usa"}, {"tags": ["Israel"], "article": "The Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra is on a diplomatic mission: to go to Israel and play at the inauguration of an Arab cultural centre. Dressed in their full regalia, they wait in vain for their welcoming party at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport. Stranded, they decide to make their own way. A linguistic cock-up, due to the fact that Egyptians have trouble producing the &apos;p&apos; and &apos;v&apos; sounds, conspires to land them in the remote, desolate and windswept desert town of Beit Hatikva, instead of Petah Tiqva. Beit Hatikva (Hebrew for &quot;House of Hope&quot;) is so off the beaten track that you are unlikely to find it on any map - that&apos;s also because it exists only in the imagination of Israeli film director Eran Kolirin. Ever since I first read about The Band&apos;s Visit (Bikur Ha-Tizmoret), I have been eager to see it. It has only just been released here in Belgium but was well worth waiting for. Kolirin wanted to make a film that looked beyond the politics of Arab-Israeli relations and to delve into the human aspect. &quot;Everyone is a little bit lonely,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;Everyone is a little bit lost.&quot; And The Band&apos;s Visit is all about loneliness and loss, delivered as a rather dark comedy, with much of the humour deriving from awkward silences and the mismatching of dysfunctional characters. Although their Egyptian accents are not convincing and the solemnity and reticence of the characters is uncharacteristic of the vast majority of Egyptians, I managed to suspend my disbelief and get into the story. The first encounter between the inhabitants of the dozy town and the band of not-so-merry musicians is memorable. Hopelessly lost, the band approach a sleepy local caf\u00e9. The handful of bored punters regard the stiff and proper arrivals, dressed in their smurf-coloured uniforms, with the kind of miffed looks reserved for an alien landing. Tewfiq, played by the veteran Israeli actor Sasson Gabai (who impressively delivers most of his lines in Arabic), asks the owner, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz, one of Israel&apos;s leading actresses), if she would be so kind as to provide them with directions to the Arab cultural centre. The wild and hard-as-nails proprietor replies that in this town there is no culture, neither Israeli nor Arab. Dina exhibits the Israeli version of Middle Eastern hospitality (which I had the good fortune of experiencing first hand). She offers to put the men up, since the town has no hotel, and bullies two of her customers into sharing the load with her. During the night the band spends in Beit Hatikva, its members and the townsfolk touch one another&apos;s lives in unexpected ways. For instance, Simon, played by the upcoming Israeli-Palestinian stage actor Khalifa Natour, provides comfort to his out-of-work host whose marriage is falling apart, and his host spurs him to finish the concerto of which he has only ever written the overture. Dina takes in the unsmiling bandleader and ladies&apos; man Khaled (the young Israeli-Palestinian actor Saleh Bakri). An unusual love affair develops between the feisty Dina and the reserved and regimented Tewfiq as they tour the town by night. A romantic at heart, Dina tells Tewfiq of the Egyptian films everyone in Israel used to watch when she was younger, and their stories of passion, sacrifice, betrayal and blazing love. Perhaps hoping that this mysterious stranger will be her very own Omar Sharif, Abdel-Halim Hafez or Rushdi Abaza, and dispel her all-embracing loneliness, she opens her heart to him and tells him of all her disastrous relationships. Dina&apos;s disarming frankness leads him, despite his reticence, to open up and articulate, albeit haltingly and in few words, the sadness and loneliness he has felt since his wife died. Uncomfortable with the unexpected intimacy, he withdraws back into his shell and Dina winds up sleeping with Khaled to try to bury her disappointment. Describing the story as that of &quot;a lost band in a lost town&quot;, the film&apos;s opening sequence tells us that &quot;not many people remember this. It&apos;s not that important.&quot; Another largely forgotten visit, which was both real and important, was that of Sana Hassan. Everyone recalls Anwar Sadat&apos;s famous visit to Jerusalem, but three years earlier, while Egyptian and Israeli forces were still deadlocked in the desert, Hassan caused a sensation and a scandal in Egypt by abandoning her diplomat husband and postgraduate studies at Harvard and moving to Israel - and Sadat forced her husband to divorce her. Driven by fascination, her desire to embark on a personal quest for peace and understand the dynamics of the society behind the conflict, she wound up spending three years in Israel, where she met people of all political hues and from all strata of society - reportedly from Golda Meir and Menachem Begin to Kibbutzim workers and street prostitutes. She wrote a book about her experiences which, perhaps due to its ambiguities and fiercely independent refusal to toe the party line of either camp, has fallen into obscurity. Unfortunately, Arab audiences have been deprived of the opportunity to see The Band&apos;s Visit. Kolirin&apos;s dream was to have the film screened at the Cairo Film Festival. However, Egyptian artists and intellectuals generally maintain an unofficial cultural boycott of Israel. While I appreciate that Arabs should not normalise economic ties with Israel until there is peace with the Palestinians, there is a need on both sides to humanise the other - and cultural exchange is essential in this regard. My own personal peace mission to Israel and Palestine last year provided me with a whole new depth of understanding. It enabled me to see the human face of Israel, which resembles their Arab neighbours in so many ways, to understand better why they think in particular ways and the complexity and ambiguity that political reductionism overlooks. Unlike the Egyptian band and their Israeli hosts, there was no shortage of words during my visit - and the endless conversations and debates I had with the family I stayed with for part of my visit and other Israelis I encountered did us all good. If more Arabs and Israelis met face to face, then this conflict could be resolved faster.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-27T09:00:00Z", "title": "Unfinished overtures", "sentences": ["Dressed in their full regalia, they wait in vain for their welcoming party at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/27/unfinishedovertures"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League", "Avram Grant"], "article": "Avram Grant talked at length today for the first time since his sacking as Chelsea manager, saying that he did not bear a grudge against Chelsea and dismissing rumours linking him with Manchester City as conjecture. Reports have been rife since he was sacked on Saturday that Thaksin Shinawatra wants him to replace Sven-Goran Eriksson at City, but Grant denied that any move had been forthcoming. &quot;It&apos;s speculation,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t say anything at the moment. If there will be something we&apos;ll talk, at the moment nothing is happening.&quot; The Israeli agent Pini Zahavi is believed to be trying to find Grant a new job. Grant, speaking before lecturing fellow Israeli coaches at a Uefa Pro coaching course in Tel Aviv which he is also participating in, said he had happy memories of Chelsea despite being dismissed after losing the Champions League final in a penalty shoot-out against Manchester United. He said he had no problems with their owner, Roman Abramovich, and insisted he had enjoyed his high-pressure stint at the club. &quot;I look back to this eight months and see good things,&quot; he said. &quot;Roman gave me the opportunity and what I had to say to him was that I love the club and now each of us goes his own way. It was a great time for me, I enjoyed very much to be at Chelsea, I breathed the club for 24 hours a day during the time I was in charge. More than this, I enjoyed the development of the club and, towards the end, the fans were great too. I wish them luck. &quot;It was a wonderful chapter in my life, I enjoyed it. It was a uniqueprofessional experience and it was good to end it with 40,000 fans cheeringand appreciating my work. I understand the initial hesitancy over myappointment but I am happy that we ended up in this way. I really likeChelsea now. I really want them to succeed but now we each go our own way.&quot; Grant said that reports of the compensation he will receive (between \u00a33.5m and \u00a37.5m) are wrong. &quot;The amount doesn&apos;t even comeclose to what was written in the papers but I won&apos;t mind if somebody will beprepared to make up the difference,&quot; he said. As to reports that he had hired a high-profile lawyer - Anthony Julius, who represented Princess Diana during her divorce \u2013 to negotiate his severance terms, he added: &quot;There are no problems with Chelsea. If I need to I will talk to them directly, not through lawyers.&quot; Grant told the press he rejected an offer to return to his old job as Chelsea&apos;s director of football after being sacked. &quot;I understand the offer and why it was made but I thought that from my point of view it was not the correct move,&quot; he said. &quot;What I discussed in private will stay private but let&apos;s say that I saw that it was not a good move for me at this stage.&quot; Following Grant&apos;s lecture, the coaches were supposed to attend a training session by a fellow coach - ex-Maccabi Tel Aviv manager Nir Levin. All showed up but one, Avram Grant. Meanwhile, the Chelsea assistant coach Henk ten Cate has insisted he does not fear for his job despite the recent sacking of Grant. Ten Cate, who left his job as Ajax head coach to become Grant&apos;s assistant at Stamford Bridge last October, said: &quot;Half an hour before Chelsea officially announced the Grant news, I was called by Peter Kenyon. He told me the news and he also said that the sacking of Grant would have no consequences for me. I would rather believe him than the newspapers reports.&quot; Ten Cate plans to meet with the Chelsea hierarchy later this week but insists this is not connected to Grant&apos;s exit. &quot;That talk was already planned for months, so it has nothing to do with the recent developments,&quot; he said. &quot;In January I had such an evaluation conversation and then we agreed that we would do it again after the season.

It creates the illusion that the picture on the record is part of said poser, and it&apos;s maybe not as odd as it first seems. In fact, we reckon it&apos;s some kind of genius. Tonight&apos;s Sleeveface party gives the folk behind the music, quite literally, a chance to shine, while Sleeveface beginners can check some all-time classics that will be projected on to the walls for misty-eyed, hilarious inspiration. Sleeveface snaps will also be taken throughout the night, so get practising for the best angles on you together with the likes of David Bowie, Debbie Harry and Elvis.

But a message was waiting from the first name on his appointments list - Tzipi Livni, the Israeli Foreign Minister who last week dramatically waded into the corruption crisis threatening her boss, Ehud Olmert, and placed herself squarely in the frame to succeed him as Prime Minister. &apos;Don&apos;t bother coming to my office,&apos; she said. &apos;I feel so cooped up here!&apos; Instead, she gave him directions to a seaside restaurant at the southern edge of the city, where he found her savouring plates of hummus, techina and eggplant salad. &apos;That,&apos; recalled the diplomat, &apos;was vintage Tzipi. She is many things - serious, incredibly smart, tough, determined ... but she is no ordinary politician.&apos; That, Livni knows, may be her strongest asset as Israeli politicians of all stripes begin to circle the beleaguered Olmert and calculate their chances of replacing him when, and if, he is forced to go.  The Israeli Prime Minister&apos;s woes make Gordon Brown seem almost secure. Olmert has not been charged with anything. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. He has outsmarted political obituary writers in a series of earlier crises over alleged corruption and his handling of Israel&apos;s 2006 war in Lebanon. But whatever course any legal process takes, even he may have difficulty finessing the political repercussions of testimony last week from a New York businessman friend, who said he had delivered around $150,000 in cash to Olmert over a period of 13 years for campaign funds and an array of personal expenses. Livni, a tall, auburn-haired former lawyer who will turn 50 next month, came to political office late in life. She was elected to the Knesset, Israel&apos;s parliament, at 41 and began her rapid climb up the cabinet ladder two years later. Even rivals recognise her potential allure as a figure utterly untainted by the serial scandals and partisan warfare that have sullied Israeli politics in the past few years. But if she came to office late, Livni came to politics early. And it was politics of a passionately ultra-nationalist hue. Her father Eitan was chief of operations in Menachem Begin&apos;s anti-British Irgun underground and her mother Sara was an Irgun footsoldier.  Livni&apos;s childhood was steeped in the enduring loyalties of Begin&apos;s so-called &apos;fighting family&apos;, in a bitter resentment towards the Labour establishment that dominated every area of public life until Begin&apos;s shock election victory in 1977, and a fierce dedication to the vision of a Jewish state on the entire biblical Land of Israel, including the West Bank.  For Tzipi Livni, the personal and political journey from her fighting-family childhood to an impassioned advocacy of a two-state compromise with the Palestinians as Israel&apos;s Foreign Minister has been no less extraordinary. And since she has repeatedly insisted that part of that deal must be an unconditional end to Palestinian terror attacks, it has not been without its extraordinary ironies.  Her father, after all, was part of the high command of the Irgun, although he was arrested three months before the assault which would lastingly brand Begin&apos;s irregulars, in the eyes not only of the British but mainstream Jewish leaders, as a terror group - their 1946 bombing of Mandate headquarters in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in which 91 people, many of them civilians, were killed. Interestingly, Livni, alone among Israeli cabinet ministers, has drawn a distinction between Palestinian attacks on civilians and on Israeli troops. &apos;Somebody who is fighting against Israeli soldiers is an enemy, and we will fight back,&apos; she told a US television interviewer. &apos;But I believe that this is not under the definition of terrorism.&apos; During her school days, while both bright and athletic, as a &apos;child of the Irgun&apos;, she was inevitably an outsider. Livni none the less excelled during her obligatory army service. She went on to work in Israel and then in Paris for the intelligence agency Mossad, work she has always resolutely refused to discuss, before taking a law degree and carving out a successful, decade-long career as a corporate attorney. Her parliamentary career began conventionally enough, as a candidate for the right-wing Likud. But as Israel&apos;s conflict with the Palestinians changed dramatically, Livni was soon changing too.  She had long viscerally objected to any compromise deal and particularly to the Oslo Accords negotiated under the Labour Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But as the 2001 Palestinian uprising, or intifada, escalated with a campaign of terror bombings against Israeli civilians - and with demographic trends pointing towards an Arab majority in an Israel that included the West Bank and Gaza - she began to rethink the assumptions she had held since childhood. Visiting London as the then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon began pressing his idea on a divided Likud for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and at least parts of the West Bank, Livni met prominent members of Britain&apos;s Jewish community. One of them asked whether she had abandoned her dream of a Greater Land of Israel. Her reply was thoughtful, earnest, quiet, almost as if the child of the Irgun were battling with the lawyer and politician she had become. It was &apos;painful,&apos; she said. But the dream she had grown up with was for a &apos;Jewish, democratic state in the Land of Israel&apos;. She had come to realise that the first two parts of that dream - a Jewish and democratic state - faced a mortal risk if Israel continued to rule over millions of people in the Palestinian territories. Two states, she had concluded, were a national imperative - not only for the Palestinians, but for Israel. The change in Livni has deepened in the years since. She was a leading force in Sharon&apos;s Gaza pullout plan and followed him out of an angry Likud to form the new centre-right Kadima party of which she and Olmert are now senior ministers, with Livni his formal deputy. But it has remained a painful, deeply personal transition. Her father&apos;s picture still has pride of place in her office. When her mother died last year, a friend who visited her recalls: &apos;You could see how enormously important both her families are to her&apos; - her husband Naftali Spitzer is an advertising executive and they have two sons, Omri and Yuval.  Yet Western diplomats who have worked with Livni trying to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process say the complex forces at work are never far from the surface. One of them laughs at media portraits of her as a &apos;dove&apos;. &apos;She is no softie,&apos; he says. &apos;On key issues for Israelis - security and opposition to an unfettered &quot;right of return&quot; for Palestinians into homes lost in 1948 or 1967 - she is as tough as anyone.&apos; But he adds: &apos;She genuinely feels a two-state agreement is necessary. Her attitude when there is an objection the Palestinians are pressing is always to go the extra mile, to try to find some creative formula for a solution, as long as it doesn&apos;t endanger what she sees as the core needs of Israel.&apos; A top US diplomat echoes that view and adds that Livni and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she is often compared, &apos;not only respect each other - they like and trust each other&apos;. The suspicion among friends and supporters has long been that Livni, like Rice, may lack the appetite for seeking the top job. When an official inquiry savaged Olmert for his handling of the Lebanon war, Livni, who had argued for a greater reliance on diplomacy, urged him to quit. But when he didn&apos;t, she backed down and stayed in the cabinet. This time, the signs are things may be different. In an uncommonly frank New York Times magazine interview last summer, Livni was asked whether she saw herself as a future Prime Minister. She replied by stressing the urgency of finding a workable two-state deal before it was too late for both sides. &apos;I want things to happen,&apos; she said, &apos;especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&apos; And did that mean going for the top job? &apos;Only for this,&apos; she said, adding, &apos;I don&apos;t like the exposure, the [trappings of] respect and so on.&apos; Last week, Olmert&apos;s key coalition partner, the former Labour Prime Minister Ehud Barak, called on him to step aside for the duration of the corruption investigation, a move that would leave Livni, as Deputy Prime Minister, temporarily in charge until early elections. Initially, she resisted pressure to issue a statement of her own. But then she did. She said the allegations against Olmert raised broader questions of &apos;the public&apos;s trust in Israeli politics&apos;. Kadima must &apos;prepare for any scenario, including early elections&apos;. And she proposed holding a primary of Kadima members for the party leadership. The following day, an opinion poll of 65,000 party members established Livni as the clear frontrunner if Olmert does go, with 39 per cent support, against 25 per cent for her nearest rival. The Livni CV Born Tzipora Malka Livni, 8 July 1958, in Tel Aviv. Nickname notwithstanding, she is anything but &apos;zippy&apos; according to those who have worked with her. She is, says one: &apos;All business... you don&apos;t joke with her.&apos; Best of times Persuading Condi Rice to get the Bush administration to go on record as saying the Palestinian refugee question must not be resolved through a wholesale right of return but in a future Palestinian state. Worst of times The 2006 Lebanon War, during which she was repeatedly sidelined by the Prime Minister and the military brass. What she says &apos;We want the Palestinian people to have a viable, secure and prosperous existence in a state of their own. This is not just a Palestinian aspiration - it is an Israeli interest, as long as it doesn&apos;t put Israel in danger.&apos; What others say &apos;What Livni wants us to do is to give up [on the right of return] before we start negotiations. She wants to remove all risk, all fears, before engaging in discussion.&apos; Palestinian politician Dr Mustafa Barghouti &apos;She is perceived as non-corrupt, as Mrs Clean amid a crisis of low moral standards within Israeli politics - an elegant, female figure among brutal, unworthy politicians.&apos; Ari Shavit, political columnist for the Israeli newspaper Ha&apos;aretz", "publicationDate": "2008-05-31T23:01:00Z", "title": "Profile: Tzipi Livni, Israel's foreign minister", "sentences": ["The Western diplomat was feeling tense and tired by the time his plane touched down in Tel Aviv, expecting yet another fraught time trying to unblock the logjam over Middle East peace.", "The Livni CV Born Tzipora Malka Livni, 8 July 1958, in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/01/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Manchester United", "Football", "Sport", "Rio Ferdinand"], "article": "The night before I go to meet Rio Ferdinand, he is at home in his mansion in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, close to where several other Manchester United players and Coronation Street stars live.

So of arguably the two best centre-forwards in the world right now (although Ferdinand would make a claim for a couple of his own team-mates), it is the ultimately disgraced Didier Drogba rather than Fernando Torres whom he will face in Moscow. Did he pay particular attention to the pair of them in action? &apos;If you see something, you&apos;ll think, &quot;Yeah... watch out for that,&quot;&apos; he says laconically. &apos;But I don&apos;t really sit there studying anyone.

The following lunchtime, he is in the anonymous surroundings of a large corporate hotel, which is where the modern football interview takes place rather than amid the smell of jockstraps and dubbin in the training-ground changing room, and the player is inevitably accompanied by his agent, and a video cameraman, who wants to film proceedings for Ferdinand&apos;s MySpace site. The claim on the site is that Ferdinand is &apos;undoubtedly one of the finest defenders in world football&apos; and over the course of the past two seasons, through his performances for United and England, few would rush screaming to the ref to dispute as much. In defending their title this season, the champions conceded 22 goals, and in Europe, including the denouement in Moscow, only six. While Nemanja Vidic enjoys the better songs at Old Trafford (&apos;He comes from Serbia, he&apos;ll fucking murder ya,&apos; for instance - rather than the bovine &apos;Rio-o-o-o&apos;), it was the 28-year-old England man who marshalled a rejigged United defence so superbly when his partner was injured come squeaky-bum time. According to Alan Hansen, once a centre-half of similar style: &apos;This season all the plaudits have gone to Cristiano Ronaldo, but... when the going has been tough, Ferdinand has performed better than anybody.&apos; Elsewhere on that internet site, there is the assertion that &apos;Rio is well-known off the pitch for his aspirational lifestyle&apos;. Setting aside his footballing achievements - three League titles now, 66 England caps, his promotion to the England captaincy for the friendly against France in March, with many observers of the opinion that Fabio Capello will ultimately hand him that gig on a permanent basis - there has always been the suspicion that the footballer is too easily distracted, that he switches off too easily. Listing his interests online, there is room for his favourite rapper (the Notorious B.I.G), his favourite movie (The Silence of the Lambs), his favourite trainers (Nike Air Force Ones) and designers (Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood), his favourite cars (Aston Martin Vanquish and DB5) and holiday locations (Tel Aviv, bizarrely, Dubai, of course, and St Lucia, where his father, Julian, grew up) and favourite tipple. That last - almost touchingly in its evocation of simpler times - is apparently Ribena. Given his extracurricular interests, and his catalogue of off-the-pitch misdemeanours - which must include his eight-month ban from football for missing a routine drugs test in September 2003 (preoccupied with the process of moving house, he popped off to Harvey Nichols in Manchester city centre to pick up some bed linen for Rebecca) - is it too much to ask which Rio Ferdinand will turn up today? Will it be the host of Rio&apos;s World Cup Wind-Ups, when he turned TV presenter just before the 2006 tournament and staged a series of Beadle-esque pranks on his team-mates - &apos;merking&apos; them, as he put it? Or is it the figure entering the suite in central Manchester, dressed in a checked shirt and cardie, who proves thoughtful and articulate?  Before the interview starts in earnest, at which point he is fully focused, he is reading a couple of text messages and relates that: &apos;My mate&apos;s reading the Garrincha book&apos; - Ruy Castro&apos;s biography of the Brazilian winger, nicknamed Mane, meaning halfwit - &apos;and he just said Garrincha lost his virginity at 13 years old to a goat... and ran over his dad when he was pissed.&apos; Ferdinand laughs, but seems suspicious. &apos;That can&apos;t be true, can it? I&apos;m not having that.&apos; The player nicknamed Plug by his team-mates (after the character in the Beano&apos;s Bash Street Kids) has put away childish things and finally become the footballer he always threatened to be, ever since his first mentor, a coach called Dave Goodwin, spotted him as an 11-year-old at district trials and said: &apos;I&apos;m going to call you Pel\u00e9, son, I like the way you play.&apos; By temperament, Ferdinand might have preferred to have been an attacking player - his first idol was John Barnes - and for Eltham Town, his second youth team, he played as a goalscoring midfielder for two seasons. But it was as a centre-half that scouts tracked him from an early age and he trained with Queens Park Rangers, Charlton, Millwall, Chelsea and even Middlesbrough (travelling to the north-east of England every school holiday for nearly a year and staying in digs) before signing a youth contract on the pitch at West Ham in January 1994. Along the way, he had also won a scholarship to the Central School of Ballet in Farringdon and four times a week for four years he would take the 63 bus up from south London to the centre of the city to attend classes that no doubt improved his natural balance. &apos;I always as a kid wanted to do something different,&apos; he says of that experience. &apos;I&apos;d get bored very easily - even playing football or hanging around with my mates. So travelling away from home, meeting new people... I enjoyed it.&apos;  Despite his peripatetic lifestyle, the Friary Estate in Peckham where Ferdinand was brought up remains an important constant. In his autobiography - Rio: My Story, ably co-authored by Shaun Custis of the Sun - he describes it in glowing terms and maintains it&apos;s &apos;not the same now, the warmth has gone&apos;; but it was also a tough place - when he was 11, a girl was stabbed to death on the stairs of the block next to his. He also went to Blackheath Bluecoat secondary school, where fellow pupil Stephen Lawrence, four years his senior, was murdered in April 1993. But even though Ferdinand&apos;s father (a tailor and part-time bouncer) left his young mum when he was nine, they remained close, and he body-swerved trouble of the worst kind. &apos;My dad and my mum always instilled the idea of respect and the importance of trying to help others out,&apos; he says. &apos;My mum was a carer for other people&apos;s kids for all my childhood and my dad would always take me and my mates out, riding bikes and playing football and whatnot in the park. And there was an adventure playground where people gave up their time to come and look after us.&apos; He adds: &apos;My mates are the same as they were when I was a kid. And that&apos;s all we ever talked about: &quot;If I make it, man, I&apos;ll never be a sell-out or toss my mates away.&quot; That&apos;s ingrained in your system where I&apos;m from. When I started getting the finer things in life that football brings, I didn&apos;t want to enjoy it by myself.&apos;  When he was 16 he joined up with the England squad for the age-group European Championship and received an Umbro bag filled with T-shirts and other pieces of kit. &apos;I came home and gave it all away. Someone rang me up and said, &quot;Bloomin&apos; hell, the whole estate&apos;s walking around in England gear!&quot; It was a just a wicked buzz.&apos; More recently, he took a group of nine friends with him to the south of France to stay on a yacht lent to Ferdinand by a business tycoon in return for regular Champions League tickets. &apos;Sitting there in the harbour, being waited on, just chilling, saying to ourselves, &quot;Fucking hell, man, we used to hang around the estate together.&quot;&apos; It was at West Ham that he made his top-flight debut at the age of 17, as a substitute on the last day of the 1995-96 season. That was also where he first developed a taste for the high life, hitting the town with players such as Frank Lampard, whose father Frank Snr had first scouted him for the club. &apos;You get in amongst it when you&apos;re a kid - you don&apos;t think - and you go to bars and the opening of clubs, you&apos;re invited here and there and you don&apos;t have to pay for anything,&apos; he says. In September 1997, he was dropped from the first England squad for which he was selected after receiving a one-year ban for drink-driving; but two months later he made his international debut in a friendly against Cameroon and then Glenn Hoddle picked him for the 1998 World Cup in France. &apos;It was a quick way to grow up,&apos; he reflects. &apos;There was no manual to help you back then. Vast sums of money are thrown at you from an early age - freebies here and there - and as a young kid, it&apos;s hard. There&apos;s different personalities out there. Someone like Michael Owen... We both went to the World Cup and all he wanted to do was play football, he wasn&apos;t really interested in going out and clubbing it and he had people around him to guide him in the right way.&apos; At that tournament, Owen scored his wonder goal against Argentina, while Ferdinand warmed the bench. &apos;Then you have the other side of the coin, which was myself, I suppose, who enjoyed seeing what was out there, who never had the opportunity to do anything like that before in my life and there was a lot coming in very easy and I wanted to experience what was out there. And I done that. Made some mistakes. But if I was to do it all again, I&apos;d do a lot of it the same way I done it before.&apos; Still worse was to follow, after he was dropped from the England squad by Kevin Keegan for the Euro 2000 finals, then made tabloid headlines with a sex-tape scandal following a holiday in Ayia Napa in Cyprus with Lampard and Kieron Dyer, at the time with Newcastle. But by then, Ferdinand was already bound for Leeds United, for a record-breaking \u00a318m transfer fee. &apos;I left London, which was probably the biggest turning point in my career,&apos; he says. &apos;I had time to sit and reflect and think, &quot;If I don&apos;t knuckle down now, when will I and what will I achieve?&quot; And I got a girlfriend&apos; - he had recently met Rebecca through a mutual friend at the Sugar Reef bar in London - &apos;and now I&apos;ve got a family, and you mature. &apos;If it was a choice between football and fame, I&apos;d take football all day long,&apos; he says, coming over all Paul Scholes. &apos;I didn&apos;t get into it for the fame, I got into playing because from the age of eight or nine I wanted to be a footballer. But fame&apos;s there now - we&apos;re like people in the charts.&apos; Ferdinand is a big music fan, an R&amp;B, hip hop and reggae fan - amusingly dismissive of the Euro house that Patrice Evra tries to play in the Old Trafford dressing room before games - who has dabbled with his own record label, White Chalk Music, and interviewed P Diddy for his own MySpace site. But he is more interested in talking about the foundation he is setting up, which is called Live The Dream, to establish a series of centres in deprived areas to mentor teenagers, and previously he has been involved in the Damilola Taylor Trust&apos;s &apos;Respect a life, not a knife&apos; initiative - Taylor was murdered on the North Peckham Estate in 2000 - meeting Tony Blair and former Home Secretary John Reid in the process. &apos;It was natural for me to get involved when there were problems in the area,&apos; he says. &apos;It was a no-brainer.&apos; It&apos;s not something you suspect Sir Alex Ferguson would necessarily grasp, but Ferdinand, through pushing his &apos;aspirational lifestyle&apos; via forums such as MySpace, believes he is trying to use his fame positively. &apos;I feel that as a footballer you have a responsibility, a duty. If you can leverage your fame or the adulation to make other people better off, you should use that... It&apos;s not about personal gain or personal accolades. It&apos;s about trying to give other people opportunities.&apos; The chief criticism of the centre-half has always been that he can be as forgetful and casual on the pitch as off it - but, in the cauldron of the Nou Camp for the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona the week before we meet, perfect concentration was allied to his coolness. &apos;Luckily for me I&apos;m not someone who gets really nervous about games,&apos; he says, although he has admitted to almost crying when the national anthem was played before England&apos;s quarter-final against Brazil at the World Cup in 2002. &apos;Experience is key. You see a lot of players who get caught up in the occasion and start looking at the crowd, but once you start doing that, your eye goes off the game. Half the time, when you&apos;re playing, you&apos;re in that zone and you don&apos;t see everything and you don&apos;t get to enjoy it as much, maybe. But I&apos;d rather be winning and doing that than standing there with a camera and taking it all in and losing.&apos; To put himself into &apos;that zone&apos;, which is where all the great players operate, a millisecond ahead of the rest of the action, Ferdinand says he runs the game &apos;through my head a little bit beforehand - just different scenarios that get me into the right frame of mind: winning the first header, making your first tackle, making your first pass, reading the first situation. You see the forward you&apos;re playing against - so and so - and you know what his best moves are and you see his moves before they come. Every now and again you jog your mind back to that. And that&apos;s come with me over the years. Beforehand I used just to go into games willy-nilly.&apos;  He confesses his mind could wander. &apos;Like, I might be going out for a meal or out with some friends - don&apos;t think about that. That&apos;s what I used to be about. Girls, sometimes. Don&apos;t think about stuff like that. As a kid it could be hard... Growing up, you get experience, you use different techniques - so that&apos;s where I&apos;m at now. When you go into the game, everything should come as second nature because you&apos;ve been thinking about it, you&apos;ve put your mind to it already.&apos; He continues: &apos;Playing in Europe is physically not as demanding as it is in the Premier League. The Premier League is hustle and bustle and the game goes from box to box for 90 minutes. Whereas in Europe... we probably had 40 per cent of possession against Barcelona in the first leg of the match with them, and in all that possession they had, you don&apos;t have to do so much running up and down the pitch, so at the end, I was tired, but more mentally than physically. &apos;It&apos;s nice when people say you&apos;ve done well and marked so-and-so out of the game&apos; - and when the kit man sorted the laundry after Barcelona, he probably expected to find Samuel Eto&apos;o in Ferdinand&apos;s shorts pocket - &apos;but football nowadays isn&apos;t as rigid as it was back in the day, when you had the No 9 playing against you, the No 5... It&apos;s much more, especially with teams like Barcelona or Arsenal, about players interchanging positions. You don&apos;t really get a constant one-on-one with one player throughout the game. You&apos;ve got to concentrate the whole 90 minutes.&apos; None the less, Ferdinand&apos;s relaxed style on the pitch can be misleading. Before the first leg of the Champions League semi, the Spanish football expert John Carlin told me that in Spain, Ferdinand carries little reputation and that the more doughty English archetype is more admired. Ferdinand, in his own defence, says: &apos;People like to see it the old English way and think that the Terry Butchers - the people who shout the loudest or who beat their chests the most - are the most passionate. I don&apos;t agree with that at all. Just because someone can be laid-back on the pitch, that doesn&apos;t mean they don&apos;t have the same passion as someone who&apos;s screaming his head off. It doesn&apos;t work like that. People are made different. You&apos;re making the fans think that you care, but you might not have the same fibre inside you as next man.&apos; Since he joined Manchester United for another record-breaking fee of \u00a329m in July 2002, controversy has continued to dog the defender. Following his eight-month ban for the missed drugs test, there was a delay in signing his new contract amid rumours that he was being courted by Chelsea when he was photographed in a London restaurant with the club&apos;s chief executive, Peter Kenyon. A group of fans with baseball caps and hoods on turned up at his house to remonstrate. &apos;Situations happen in your life,&apos; he says, &apos;and you have to deal with them in the way you think is right. My dad never brought me up to run away from anything and if someone comes to your house, regardless of whether you play football or not... it&apos;s your house and you&apos;re not going to let anyone take liberties. I didn&apos;t know it was going to be 15, 20 men standing out there, though, I thought it was just one or two guys.&apos;  &apos;He was on full pay for those eight months he missed,&apos; says Andy Mitten, editor of the fanzine United We Stand. &apos;And then to have the audacity to push United for a bigger deal - that&apos;s what upset people. But he has always wanted to be liked by the fans, and he has turned it round since then.&apos; It also helped that relationship that when Ferdinand and his defensive colleague John O&apos;Shea were injured for the fifth round of the FA Cup against Liverpool in 2006, they watched from the away end at Anfield. &apos;It was unbelievable. I&apos;d not been in with the fans since I was a kid,&apos; Ferdinand says (he sometimes watched his mum&apos;s club, Millwall), &apos;and to be able to go in there and feel the energy... There was such a mad buzz. Me and Sheasy still speak about it now. The manager didn&apos;t say anything afterwards&apos; - you suspect Ferguson would have been secretly pleased - &apos;but for our own safety it was wise that we didn&apos;t make a habit of it.&apos; Now Ferdinand says that he wants to end his career at Old Trafford. &apos;I hope so... touch wood. I always said that I&apos;d love to play abroad at some point, but I&apos;m at Man United.. Why would I want to go to Barcelona or Real Madrid or whoever, if they wanted me? It&apos;s not something I want to try and test.&apos; Two weeks after we meet he signs a new five-year contract with the club. Ferdinand describes the atmosphere as &apos;the best I&apos;ve known at Old Trafford, and that&apos;s down in large part to the manager. If you come in wearing something funny, he&apos;ll be the first to take the mickey.&apos; He has previously described himself as the &apos;number-one prankster&apos; at the club, but &apos;there&apos;s a little group now that&apos;s involved. Wes Brown. Wazza [Rooney]. Darren Fletcher - he&apos;s the silent assassin. Ronaldo. And one of the younger lads, Gerard Piqu\u00e9. That&apos;s the group normally involved if something happens to someone&apos;s clothes, or if there&apos;s something in the papers about someone it goes straight up on the dressing-room wall... But it&apos;s all good banter. No one gets picked on all the time.&apos;  His next role could be the England captaincy, on a permanent basis. &apos;To be thought of is an achievement in itself,&apos; he says, &apos;and when I was given the opportunity against France it was one of the proudest moments of my footballing career if not the [proudest].&apos; When he was at Leeds, Ferdinand took over the captaincy from the South African stalwart Lucas Radebe and felt so embarrassed that he refused to take the special captain&apos;s spot in the club car park for weeks. But there will be nothing like that if he does take over the England job from his friend, the fall guy in the Champions League final, John Terry.  &apos;I think we&apos;ve got past the Becks issue in terms of the captaincy,&apos; he says in reference to the cult of personality surrounding his sometime team-mate. &apos;There can be awkward situations - but I&apos;m sure JT dealt with it in the right way. And if someone else is given the captaincy, I&apos;m sure the same will happen. We&apos;re all in it for the same reasons and if anyone is bitter about not getting the captaincy, they shouldn&apos;t be in the England team, because that&apos;s going to be detrimental to the side. I think that&apos;s the good thing about the new manager. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s worried about people&apos;s pride or their feelings, he&apos;s here to start a mentality and a trend of winning. He&apos;s been a winner wherever he&apos;s been - he&apos;s done everything.&apos; Is Capello less friendly with the players than the previous incumbent? &apos;Yeah. I think it was difficult for Steve McClaren - being a coach, that&apos;s his job, being in and around the players every day, working with them. Don&apos;t forget, he was part of the Treble-winning team [as assistant manager at United in 1999], so he knows what it takes to win, but the transition from coach to manager is a difficult one. This [new] manager has come in cold and his ideas have been implemented straight away. There are no ifs and buts and I think the players respect that.&apos; Like Ferguson, who &apos;has an aura around him&apos;, when Capello walks into the room, &apos;everyone takes notice&apos;, according to Ferdinand, because of his track record. &apos;That&apos;s what we need. So we&apos;re hopefully starting on the right road now.&apos; Given England&apos;s failure to qualify for Euro 2008, the summer will be a time of rest for Ferdinand, although he and Rebecca plan to get married and a brother or sister for Lorenz, who is almost two, is also on the way.  After the interview, he nips out of the hotel and saunters across a main road to a verge of grass to have his portrait taken. Passersby stop and stare and film him on their camera-phones and he signs autographs; a teenager scuttles by and, grinning, mutters almost under his breath &apos;City&apos;, and Ferdinand laughs. I mean to say something along the lines of &apos;Good luck in Moscow&apos;, which actually comes out as &apos;Make sure you stuff those Blue bastards&apos;. And Rio Ferdinand, disarmingly serious again, insists: &apos;Don&apos;t worry, we will.&apos; At Moscow&apos;s Luzhniki Stadium, on the night of 21 May, he is rock-solid again in United&apos;s torturous victory over Chelsea, and the silliest of grins is writ large when (with Ryan Giggs) he hoists the trophy. In the aftermath, he confesses that he had trouble sleeping on the afternoon of the match, hails the manager&apos;s team talk before it, and is thrilled when someone tells him that now he will be an idol with the fans. &apos;Who would have thought that, when you were kids, playing football on your estates, you would have an opportunity to play in a win a game like this,&apos; Ferdinand says of the experience. Back in Manchester, he had reflected: &apos;I wake up more and more now thinking that I&apos;d love to stay in the game in some capacity - as a coach or a manager. I&apos;m not sure. I&apos;ve got ages yet. I don&apos;t dwell too much on it. When I finish my career, I&apos;ll sit down and take stock, but to make a decision now would be... silly. But the TV and my other interests... it&apos;s appealing, but they&apos;re hobbies. I know that I&apos;m a footballer first and foremost and nothing else will ever get in the way of that.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-31T23:01:00Z", "title": "A united front: OSM meets the real Rio Ferdinand", "sentences": ["Listing his interests online, there is room for his favourite rapper (the Notorious B.I.G), his favourite movie (The Silence of the Lambs), his favourite trainers (Nike Air Force Ones) and designers (Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood), his favourite cars (Aston Martin Vanquish and DB5) and holiday locations (Tel Aviv, bizarrely, Dubai, of course, and St Lucia, where his father, Julian, grew up) and favourite tipple."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/01/manchesterunited"}, {"tags": [], "article": "Linda Grant was born in Liverpool.

Yair Klein, 64, a reserve lieutenant colonel in the Israel defence forces (IDF)and a veteran of the six-day and Yom Kippur wars, has done business with armed groups in Latin America and Africa for 25 years. He has spent nine months in a Moscow prison but last week the Russian supreme court ordered that the extradition go ahead. Klein&apos;s Russian lawyer turned to the human rights court for a temporary stay on the grounds that he could suffer ill-treatment if sent to Bogot\u00e1. There were also concerns about the fairness of the 2001 trial, which sentenced him in absentia. During the hearing he said: &quot;Extradition to Colombia would mean a death sentence.&quot; While the court deliberates - which could take months - Klein&apos;s supporters in Israel, who consider him a war hero, will continue to campaign for his return. His Israeli lawyer, Mordechai Tsivin, said: &quot;In Israel his arrival would be great joy.&quot; Klein&apos;s exploits came to light in April 1989, when Jos\u00e9 Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gacha, one of the Medell\u00edn cartel leaders, died in a shootout with a joint US-Colombian law enforcement team. A search of his ranch revealed 178 Galil assault rifles, made in Israel. They were part of a larger arms shipment that Klein had helped to arrange through a corrupt deal with the island government of Antigua. Also found at the ranch was a video of Klein&apos;s training camp. Its broadcast in August 1989 by NBC News caused an international scandal. By that time Klein had fled the country and the following year he was fined $13,400 by an Israeli court for illegally exporting arms. He claimed that he was simply training farmers to defend themselves against leftwing guerrillas. But official investigations and testimony from paramilitaries and mercenary trainers have contradicted his account. It emerged that after leaving the IDF in 1982 Klein set up a private military company called Spearhead. His first contract was supplying basic army equipment to the Lebanese Christian Phalangists, shortly after their massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.  In the 1990s Klein was reported to be training President Charles Taylor&apos;s &quot;anti-terrorist unit&quot; in Liberia. In January 1999 he was arrested in neighbouring Sierra Leone, and accused of trading diamonds for the supply of arms to the rebel Revolutionary United Front, notorious for chopping off children&apos;s limbs. After 16 months in prison he was released without trial in circumstances that remain unclear. Last year an Interpol warrant was issued for Klein&apos;s arrest and in August he was detained in Moscow as he was about to board a flight for Tel Aviv. This time Israel, now Colombia&apos;s top arms supplier in its fight against leftwing guerrillas and drug barons, seems to have abandoned him. Backstory Yair Klein comes from a long line of mercenaries involved in the developing world&apos;s dirty wars and coups - memorably fictionalised in Frederick Forsyth&apos;s novel The Dogs of War. In the Congo crisis in the early 1960s Irish-born &quot;Mad&quot; Mike Hoare and Frenchman Bob Denard were hired at different times by the government of Mo\u00efse Tshombe and rebel groups.

Calculations by the Adva Centre, an independent policy centre in Tel Aviv, suggest Israel&apos;s economy has been held back, inequality within the country has grown and there have been significant government budget cuts to pay for mounting defence spending.  Adva openly admits that its findings, contained in a new report published today and entitled The Cost of Occupation, challenge the widely received opinion that Israel&apos;s economy is successful despite the conflict: economic growth last year reached 5.3% and was above 5% for the previous two years. However, Adva&apos;s report said: &quot;The truth is that the conflict with the Palestinians is like a millstone around the neck of Israel: it undermines economic growth, burdens the budget, limits social development, sullies its vision, hangs heavy on its conscience, harms its international standing, exhausts its army, divides it politically, and threatens the future of its existence as a Jewish nation-state.&quot; Adva&apos;s figures show Israel&apos;s economy grew 43% between 1997 and 2006, well behind world economic growth during that period of 67% and growth of 68% in the US and in the EU.  Although it is almost impossible to calculate an accurate cost of the occupation of the Palestinian territories because much of the defence budget is secret, Adva said that additions to the defence budget to pay for increased military activity in the territories came to 36.6bn shekels between 1989 and 2008.  That amount is greater than the government&apos;s budget for elementary, secondary and tertiary education in Israel this year, it said. In addition, the cost of the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Gaza in 2005 came to 9bn shekels and the cost of the West Bank barrier, which Israel is now building, is estimated at an extra 13bn shekels. &quot;Israel is paying a heavy price for the continuation of the conflict and for the absence of a fair and agreed-upon partition,&quot; the report said. Last year the Israeli government appointed the Brodet Commission to undertake a rare review of the country&apos;s defence spending.  Adva quoted the commission&apos;s report as saying: &quot;The important point is that the conflict with the Palestinians is becoming expensive, mainly from the standpoint of the diversion of limited military resources like manpower and command attention; all that on an ongoing basis and without much change on the horizon.&quot; Adva said that one in every five Israeli families now ranked as poor, against one in every 10 in the 1970s, which it said was partly a result of the conflict and partly due to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia who have struggled to find work. Social security payments, particularly child allowances, unemployment compensation and income maintenance, were cut significantly between 2001 and 2005, at least in part because of rising defence costs.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-03T23:01:00Z", "title": "Occupation has cost Israel dear, says report", "sentences": ["Calculations by the Adva Centre, an independent policy centre in Tel Aviv, suggest Israel&apos;s economy has been held back, inequality within the country has grown and there have been significant government budget cuts to pay for mounting defence spending."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/04/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Ehud Olmert"], "article": "Ehud Olmert has faced five investigations since becoming the prime minister of Israel in early 2006.  All the cases relate to the years before Olmert took over as leader, and he has denied any wrongdoing in each. Although he has faced several calls to resign, he has not been charged with any crime. In the latest - and apparently most serious \u2013 case, investigators are trying to determine whether he broke campaign finance and bribery laws by accepting at least $150,000 (\u00a375,000) in donations from Morris Talansky, a US businessman.  Talansky told a Jerusalem court he handed Olmert envelopes stuffed with cash over a 15-year period including the time during which the politician was the trade minister and mayor of Jerusalem. Olmert has said they were legitimate campaign contributions. Police are also investigating accusations that Olmert gave favours in return for a discount on the purchase price of an apartment he bought in Cremieux Street, Jerusalem, in 2004.  Investigators suspect that Olmert, who had been mayor of Jerusalem for a decade until 2003, helped arrange favours in the form of building permits for the real estate firm that brokered the deal.  In October, police began an investigation into his conduct while he was the minister for industry, trade and labour in 2003, studying allegations that he may have appointed friends and associates to positions in a state business authority. Police also investigated his conduct as the finance minister during the privatisation of the state-owned Bank Leumi.  The tender for the sale of the bank was issued in November 2005, and there were claims Olmert changed the terms of the sale to benefit an Australian businessman and friend although, in the end, the businessman did not make a bid for the bank.  Olmert was questioned by fraud investigators but police closed the case in November 2007, saying there was not enough evidence to proceed. He was also investigated over his sale of an apartment in Jerusalem, but the state comptroller cleared him of any wrongdoing in March 2006.  A second investigation was begun over his purchase of an apartment in Tel Aviv in 2005, but that case was closed early this year. Separately to the legal investigations, the Israeli government&apos;s conduct of the war in Lebanon in 2006 was criticised by the Winograd committee, an official Israeli inquiry into the conflict.  The committee found &quot;serious failings and shortcomings&quot; in the country&apos;s political and military leadership. In the first part of its report, about the opening days of the war, it said Olmert bore &quot;supreme and comprehensive responsibility&quot; for the failings.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-04T09:05:45Z", "title": "The investigations into Ehud Olmert", "sentences": ["A second investigation was begun over his purchase of an apartment in Tel Aviv in 2005, but that case was closed early this year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/04/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["US elections 2008", "US news", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "US politics"], "article": "Here&apos;s some advice for Barack Obama: if you want to take a trip to the Middle East, don&apos;t go to Iraq with John McCain. Go to Israel, and take a walk around Jerusalem before you make your next speech about the holy city. Speaking in Washington DC, Obama yesterday told Aipac, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, that Jerusalem will &quot;remain the capital of Israel and it will remain undivided&quot;. That&apos;s news to the US state department, whose embassy is located in Tel Aviv. As is Britain&apos;s. In fact there are no embassies in Jerusalem. And there is a reason for that: Jerusalem is disputed territory. In his apparent eagerness to overcompensate for his willingness to talk to Iran, Obama is now presenting himself as the Jewish state&apos;s most robust defender. But pledging that Jerusalem will remain undivided is not in Israel&apos;s long term interest. Many, perhaps even a majority of Israelis, don&apos;t want a permanently united Jerusalem including all its Arab neighbourhoods. If Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel then why, ever since the city was re-united in 1967, have successive municipal administrations neglected the eastern half, where its Arab residents live, while pouring cash and resources into new Jewish neighbourhoods?  As even the right-leaning Jerusalem Post newspaper has noted, &quot;the long- neglected predominantly Arab half of the city still lags far behind the rest of Jerusalem in terms of infrastructure, roads, garbage collection, housing and green areas.&quot; A stroll from downtown West Jerusalem, with its beautifully restored Ottoman buildings, to the ramshackle and undeveloped Shuafat quarter in the east, for example, would be most instructive for Obama. It might also stir some uncomfortable parallels with America&apos;s own history. The mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, has announced a new \u00a325m plan to develop the eastern half, and openly admits that its aim is to lock the Arab side in. &quot;The city will be united when we remove the gaps that exist between west and east Jerusalem.&quot;  Forward-thinking Israeli politicians know that eventually Jerusalem will have to be divided and are prepared to do so. There are 242,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem. Most do not want to be Israeli citizens, and nor do most Israelis want them to be.  Last autumn, Haim Ramon, a member of the Knesset for Kadima, the party of prime minister Ehud Olmert, laid out his party&apos;s position: &quot;The Jewish neighbourhoods will be recognised as Israeli and under Israeli sovereignty. Accordingly, the Arab neighbourhoods will be recognised as Palestinian.&quot; The speech caused a predictable furore - especially among American ultra-Zionists - so much so that prime minister Ehud Olmert quite rightly told the American Jewish organisations to mind their own business. He knows that Aipac is losing, not gaining support, among American Jews, many of whom are increasingly fed up with its kneejerk support for the most rightwing forms of Zionism. The basic framework for the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long been laid out: a return, more or less, to Israel&apos;s 1967 borders, and a viable and contiguous Palestinian state on the West Bank, linked by a corridor to Gaza, with its capital in East Jerusalem. That, not annexing more Palestinian territory, will be the best guarantee of Israel&apos;s security.  For more US election coverage, click here.

His distinctive, archaic style recalled the art and architecture of the ancient Mediterranean - as he put it, &quot;I was born on the Adriatic and am bound to the world of the south&quot; - but commemorated some characteristically modern phenomena. Cascella was born in Pescara, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy, where he was trained in an impressive variety of media by his father Tommaso, before taking a more conventional course at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. Early successes, notably an appearance at the Rome Quadriennale of 1943, were followed by participation in the Venice Biennale of 1948 and some significant public commissions. The third-class waiting room at Rome&apos;s central station, for which Cascella designed mosaics in 1949 with his first wife Anna Maria Cesarini Sforza, may not have been the most auspicious of starts, but it was followed by much grander projects, notably the ceiling of the Salone delle Riunioni at the ministry of foreign affairs in Rome (1955-56). Not all of Cascella&apos;s work in this period was on such a large scale. Using materials as varied as ceramic, bronze, cement, sand and wire netting, in the 1950s he created a number of small, tactile reliefs, sometimes adorned with surreal, biomorphic forms inspired by his friend, the Chilean artist Roberto Matta. For a few years Cascella became increasingly inventive and unpredictable, even after he received, in 1958, a commission that confirmed his career as a sculptor of large monuments. His memorial for Auschwitz-Birkenau took nine years to complete. The original design, produced in collaboration with his older brother Andrea and the Spanish architect Julio Lafuente, referred to the railway wagons in which the victims were transported. However, it was eventually succeeded by a less representational, wall-like construction, 50m long (realised with the help of the Italian architect Giorgio Simoncini and the Polish sculptor Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz). In the final version, it is the formal contrasts - between horizontal and vertical shapes, smooth surfaces and rough, cyclopean blocks - that give the composition its expressive power. Although there are some anthropomorphic figures, in general it is remarkably abstract, in contrast to the socialist realist style that was then dominant in eastern Europe. At Auschwitz Cascella had developed an artistic vocabulary that lent itself to other contexts, from the headquarters of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to Independence Park in Tel Aviv; from grand fountains to celebrations of the Italian resistance or the carabinieri. This solemn style even appears in the works decorating his own home, the castle of Verrucola at Fivizzano in Massa Carrara, Tuscany, to which he moved in 1977. It would perhaps be unjust to say that his large sculptures all look the same, but it is certainly tempting. Yet at their best, Cascella&apos;s creations have an architectural quality that encourages interaction from the viewer and helps them to come alive. As he said of his memorial to Giuseppe Mazzini (1970-74) in the Piazza della Repubblica in Milan: &quot;The most important aspect of my sculpture... is to make people participate in the work, becoming at the same time actors and spectators...&quot; in a square visited by &quot;nursing mothers in the morning, workmen at midday and prostitutes at night, all playing their part&quot;. As well as being theatrical, much of his art has a ritualistic quality. For open-air settings, he made strange, walled structures that look like prehistoric sanctuaries, while smaller carvings, in travertine rock, represented archetypal forms: cosmic bodies, germinating seeds, even women in childbirth. Their simplified, geometric shapes are reminiscent of the abstract sculptor Constantin Brancusi, while also looking distinctly archaic. This desire to evoke antiquity was memorably expressed in 1985 in the carving Greca, again in travertine, in which a human figure has been absorbed into a column topped by a cornice. Most remarkable of all, however, is the mausoleum, resembling an ancient necropolis, that Cascella created in the early 1990s for Berlusconi at his country house at Arcore, north of Milan. The burial chamber, which contains 36 spaces for Berlusconi, his family and friends, lies beneath 100 tons of abstract sculpture symbolising the vault of heaven. Meanwhile, another room represents objects for the after-life, including keys and a mobile phone - equipment for a modern pharaoh. A glimpse of the complex can be seen in the recent documentary film Quando c&apos;era Silvio, which opens with a sequence showing a visit by Mikhail Gorbachev. The former Soviet leader looks, at best, bemused. As Berlusconi is now once again his country&apos;s prime minister, he was able to greet the news of Cascella&apos;s death with an official tribute, lamenting &quot;the loss of an extraordinary friend&quot; and &quot;one of contemporary sculpture&apos;s greatest interpreters&quot;. He is survived by four children, Benedetta, Tommaso, Susanna and Jacopo, and by his wife, the Swiss sculptor Cordelia von den Steinen, whom he met in 1965. \u00b7 Pietro Cascella, sculptor, born February 2 1921; died May 18 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-06-05T23:50:55Z", "title": "Obituary: Pietro Cascella", "sentences": ["At Auschwitz Cascella had developed an artistic vocabulary that lent itself to other contexts, from the headquarters of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to Independence Park in Tel Aviv; from grand fountains to celebrations of the Italian resistance or the carabinieri."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/06/art.italy"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US politics"], "article": "The American professors whose bestselling book, The Israel Lobby, provoked a media storm are bracing themselves for a hostile reception when they speak this week at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv.  Professors Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer faced a barrage of criticism for their work, released last September as an expansion of an article published by the London Review of Books in 2006. They argue that the powerful pro-Israel lobby in the US has enormous influence on US foreign policy - operating, they say, against the American national interest and also the interests of Israel. While some describe the claims as a welcome contribution to debate on America&apos;s relationship with Israel, others denounce them as the work of Jewish conspiracy theorists.  &quot;Their decision to come here means they are looking for a good fight,&quot; said Akiva Eldar, columnist for the Israeli newspaper Ha&apos;aretz. &quot;Most Israelis who have heard of the professors believe that they are antisemites, anti-Israeli, biased and wrong.&quot; But the authors hold that, unlike the US, Israel is willing to engage in a discussion on the subject.  &quot;Israelis are much better able to talk about Israeli policy and the US-Israeli relationship in a critical way,&quot; said Mearsheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago. &quot;They have a much more open and vibrant debate in Israel.&quot;  He said that several speaking engagements in the US had been cancelled due to &quot;pressure from the lobby&quot;.  The professors argue that the US pro-Israel lobby is similar in its operation to other interest groups, such as the farm lobby. The problem, they suggest, is its effect: unconditional support of Israel as policy.  &quot;It would make eminently good sense if the United States could criticise Israel when Israel was pursuing policies that American leaders thought were foolish,&quot; said Mearsheimer. He cites as an example the continued existence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, despite it being official US policy to oppose them. &quot;Would it not have been better for Israel if the United States had long ago put serious pressure on Israel to stop building settlements?&quot;  One topic of the professor&apos;s speaking tour will be Aipac, the pro-Israel lobby group whose annual conference in Washington this month was dominated by discussions on Iran as a nuclear threat. &quot;Aipac is one of the principal driving forces pushing the United States to use military force against Iran,&quot; said Mearsheimer, adding that the group is &quot;the most important and certainly the most powerful&quot; component of the pro-Israel lobby.

The actor-turned-teacher-turned-lecturer spends his university holidays setting up drama workshops for teenagers in some of the world&apos;s regions of conflict. It has taken him to the West Bank, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and South Africa. Four years ago, one Sunday morning, Oddie, a senior drama lecturer at the University College Plymouth St Mark and St John, was thinking about the state of the world. The west was still reeling from the tremors of September 11; racial tensions were higher than they had been for some time; Britain and the US were engaged in war in Iraq; and troops had just launched an attack on Falluja. &quot;I asked my students, &apos;what can I do, what can we do?&apos;,&quot; Oddie, 62, says. &quot;My answer was that I could create an arts project that would lead to a more peaceful world. I would develop a global network of young people, artists and educators who would share stories, build bridges and challenge prejudices,&quot; he says. &quot;And I would concentrate on working with young people in regions of conflict, helping them to reconcile their differences with one another.&quot; Resource for reconciliation Days later, Oddie came up with what he calls a &quot;naff&quot; name that stuck: Arrow, short for Art: a Resource for Reconciliation Over the World. Today, Arrow&apos;s drama workshops and theatre summer schools give marginalised teenagers in the Middle East, west Africa, South Africa and the Balkans one of the only tools they have: self-expression. And it&apos;s proving very powerful. In Beit Jala, on the West Bank, teenagers used to &quot;spend all their free time throwing stones in the street&quot;, says Marina Barham, who runs Arrow under the auspices of her Al-Harah theatre. &quot;They were very judgmental of each other. Now they know what they want and theatre is very much a part of that,&quot; she says. In South Africa, Nasreen Rasool helps black and white teenagers come together. &quot;The project has provided a platform where [young people] can express themselves and learn more about one another and their different cultures,&quot; she says. &quot;They are moving away from the stereotypes. It&apos;s made them understand the commonality between them.&quot; Theatres have long had a magical impact in times of conflict, Oddie says. He cites the Dodona theatre in Kosovo which, at the height of war in 1992, was a hive of cultural activities and of community spirit. The theatre was considered one of the few spaces where people felt free to laugh or cry. &quot;Through the arts we can give form, expression and meaning to our stories, our fears and our aspirations,&quot; he says. &quot;We can acknowledge past pain and rehearse alternative futures. The arts have a unique contribution to make towards relationship-building. These teenagers are building their confidence in themselves and their peers, and raising their self-esteem.&quot; Arrow groups post photos of themselves on the project&apos;s website, art-peace.co.uk. Even those who are in conflict with each other share resources. Playwright and director Jeton Neziraj, who runs Arrow in Kosovo, is now accepted by the Albanian Arrow group and the Serbian one. Neziraj, an Albanian, has written a play, The Bridge, which both groups have performed. But Oddie knows he can only go so far. You might expect that a drama workshop that hopes to reconcile divisions in the Middle East or the Balkans would bring Palestinian and Israeli teenagers, and Serbian and Albanian ones, together. Sadly not yet. &quot;They aren&apos;t ready for that,&quot; Oddie says. In the Middle East, he says, he &quot;can&apos;t see a point next week or next year when they will be&quot;. Barham told him, shortly after meeting him, that &quot;if you are trying to make us reconcile with Israel, we can&apos;t&quot;. &quot;I would love to be able to say to Marina [Barham] that I have made contact with this theatre company in Tel Aviv supportive of the peace movement and ask if she would work with them. But I know that she would say no. And I am not going to say &apos;right, Arrow is going to work with someone else then&apos;. We&apos;ve built up trust. Who am I to say they should reconcile? When I first went to the West Bank, I was traumatised to see settlements bristling with wires and guns and to see the hideous wall worming its way into Bethlehem.&quot; The prospect of reconciliation in Kosovo is not so unthinkable. The Albanian teenagers and their Serbian peers know about each other, but won&apos;t work together yet. And on his last visit to Kosovo, Neziraj told Oddie about an Albanian woman who had been told by soldiers to pick which of her children was to be shot. Peace-building For Oddie, theatre workshops and the arts can do something for reconciliation and peace-building that politicians and policy-makers can&apos;t. &quot;Artists enable people to see their situation in a way they haven&apos;t before,&quot; he says. &quot;Politicians can negotiate a treaty, but that&apos;s useless if it&apos;s not accepted that the treaty is needed. &quot;It&apos;s the language of drama, with its metaphors, sounds and rhythms that does it. They give form to our deepest feelings and bring about change.&quot; Today Oddie will take this message to the House of Commons, where there will be a reception to drum up investors. The project is at a watershed. It wants to develop a permanent presence on the stage of global peace-building. Politicians have been falling over themselves to show support - four Plymouth MPs are attending today&apos;s event. What&apos;s needed now is cash. A \u00a390,000 grant from the Department for International Development (DfID) has run out and the project is mainly drawing on small grants of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a315,000 from unions and charities. Oddie uses his \u00a310,000 National Teaching Fellowship Award, given to him two years ago, to travel. &quot;How do we struggle to get a few thousand pounds when billions are spent on the arms trade?&quot; he asks. &quot;We have found it very difficult to break into the commercial area for sponsorship.&quot; When Oddie gets disheartened, he turns to one of his inspirations. They include Olaudah Equiano, whose story Oddie has developed and performed as a one-man show. Equiano, born in the 18th century, was the son of a village chief in what is now Nigeria. At 11 he became a slave. He worked on a plantation in Virginia and was bought by a British naval officer, only to be sold again in the West Indies, where he eventually won his freedom. Equiano married an English woman and became a tireless fighter for justice and the abolition of slavery. &quot;He never lost his determination, faith or humour,&quot; says Oddie. Another inspiration is Desmond Tutu. Tutu chairs the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, which hears the victims and perpetrators of human rights abuses. Tutu has described the committee as &quot;like a stage on which people tell their stories and really listen to each other&quot;. For Oddie, this is exactly what Arrow is all about. Shortly after Arrow was formed, Oddie wrote to Tutu to ask for his blessing and support. To his surprise, Tutu wrote back that the concept was &quot;exciting, especially as it is so apt for the times&quot;. In November 2006, the Desmond Tutu Centre opened at the college in Plymouth as Arrow&apos;s global centre. In the past 10 years, Oddie has drawn strength from Buddhism, which he sees as &quot;dealing with the world as it really is&quot; and less dogmatic than Judeo-Christianity. The Buddha seems to say, work with what you have directly experienced and look at how you can work with the core suffering that goes on now.&quot; This is exactly what Oddie - and Arrow - are striving to do.

He alleges that Israel faces &quot;an intensified campaign of delegitimisation, demonisation and double standards&quot;. With respect, the boot is on the other foot. His intemperate attack on his opponents, with its sweeping generalisations and uncorroborated slurs, is itself a form of demonisation and an attempt to delegitimise two perfectly valid debates. One debate concerns the question of how to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Prosor describes calls for a &quot;one-state solution&quot; as &quot;disingenuous&quot;, amounting to &quot;a movement advocating Israel&apos;s destruction&quot;. Has he forgotten that a section of the right in his own country supports a version of a one-state solution: annexation of the West Bank and Gaza into a unified state of Israel? His broadside, of course, is aimed against a different part of the political spectrum. But even here, there is no single, simple one-state idea. Variations include a unitary secular state, a binational state, a confederation, and so on. Moreover, some people see a &quot;one-state solution&quot; as a long-term goal, others as an immediate imperative. There are pros and cons for each view, just as there are for a &quot;two-state solution&quot; \u2013 which also takes several different forms. (A secular Jewish friend of mine from Tel Aviv tells me he supports three states for three peoples: Palestine for Palestinians, Jerusalem for religious Jews, and Tel Aviv for people like himself. He is only half-joking.)  In short, there is a range of possibilities. People of goodwill who care about the future for all the inhabitants of the conflict-torn territory between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan are entitled to debate them. Let the ambassador enter this complex debate instead of trying to close it down at a stroke by labelling his opponents Israel-haters. The &quot;one-state solution&quot;, Prosor says, is &quot;euphemistic&quot;. Then what is the &quot;two-state solution&quot; that his government says it supports, given the expansion of Israeli settlements in Palestinian areas? As recently as last week, Ze&apos;ev Boim, the Israeli housing minister, announced plans to build nearly 900 new residential units for Israeli Jews in Pisgat Ze&apos;ev and Har Homa. Officially, both neighbourhoods are part of the municipality of Jerusalem. Actually (as I saw for myself the other day with Har Homa), they sit astride West Bank hilltops.  Ambassador Prosor says that those who promote a &quot;one-state solution&quot; &quot;distort Israel&apos;s past&quot;. Does he imply that people on his side of the argument do not distort the past? History does not speak for itself. Arguing over the past is part and parcel of the debate; so his point is null and void. He goes on to say that his opponents deny &quot;Israel&apos;s right to exist as a liberal Jewish democratic state&quot;. Setting aside the question of what &quot;a liberal Jewish democratic state&quot; means, the abstract &quot;right to exist&quot; is not the focus of this debate. When I was in Jerusalem earlier this week, a number of (Jewish) Israeli friends expressed their concern as to whether the state has a future \u2013 not a right to a future but the reality of one \u2013 given the deadlocked status quo and the intransigence of their own government. Which brings me to the other debate that Ambassador Prosor tries to delegitimise. The campaign for an academic boycott of Israel is, he says, &quot;a licence to harass, humiliate and victimise purely on grounds of nationality&quot;. Although it is ambiguous, I trust he means that this is the unintended effect, not the intention, of the campaign. Even so, he grossly exaggerates, putting the proponents in a wretched light without any regard to their motivations or their reasons. As with any political campaign, different people support a boycott for different reasons. The people I know see a boycott primarily as a non-violent way of exerting pressure on an intransigent government. They could, of course, be misguided. If Prosor thinks so, let him make the case. For there is a case to be made. From its inception, I have argued against the boycott campaign. For that matter, I continue to believe that a two-state formula \u2013 a meaningful version with a strong, coherent Palestinian state alongside Israel \u2013 is the best way out of the current impasse. I could be wrong on both counts. Let&apos;s have the argument. But Ambassador Prosor does not engage the argument. Instead, he exaggerates the picture, vilifies the opposition and caricatures their views. What I wonder, Mr Ambassador, is this: did you really expect to win the hearts and minds of your audience this way?

We are a family of four making our first-ever trip to Israel to see my sister and her family in August. In view of security, what is the best way for us to travel about? Are there any other general safety tips? Sue Thurlow, Warwickshire  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (fco.gov.uk/travel) says there is a high threat from Palestinian terrorism in Israel, with indiscriminate attacks in places frequented by foreign travellers. It cites a suicide attack in the Red Sea resort of Eilat in January 2007 and a shooting in West Jerusalem last March which left eight dead and dozens wounded. It also warns against using public transport due to suicide attacks. You&apos;ll see tight security everywhere: your bags may be X-rayed on entry to shops and public areas. The Israel tourist office (020 7299 1100; thinkisrael.com) has safety advice, but check the FCO website before you leave and seek local advice once there. Hiring a car is a good way to explore Israel (although Israeli soldiers may hail a lift). Your own wheels come in handy for exploring the Golan Heights, Upper Galilee or Negev. Trains link Haifa, Tel Aviv (including Ben Gurion Airport) and Jerusalem - see israrail.org.il for times and fares. Buses also run to pretty much anywhere (egged.co.il). State-run transport shuts down on Shabbat (Friday afternoon to Saturday evening). Smaller Arab-run services continue to run on some routes during Shabbat. I&apos;m taking my four kids to Yellowstone Park then driving to Bend in Oregon. I&apos;ve been told it&apos;s one of the richest areas for dinosaur remains in the world and I&apos;d love to show my kids dinosaur footprints. Where can we see some?Jeremy Brock, by email While northern states of the US are rich in dinosaur remains, there aren&apos;t too many chances to see tracks imprinted in rock. Wyoming, where Yellowstone is located, has a well-known set of dinosaur tracks at Red Gulch near Greybull, but it&apos;s a hefty 170-mile drive from Yellowstone in the wrong direction from Bend. See http://tinyurl.com/59we44 for a list of many of the dinosaur tracks that can be visited in America.  There is, however, much of prehistoric interest in the area. The direct route from Yellowstone to Bend passes through Idaho, but if you&apos;ve time to detour north through Montana (mtdinotrail.org) you&apos;ll find dozens of sites where dinosaur remains have been unearthed. Bozeman&apos;s Museum of the Rockies has one of the world&apos;s largest collections of dinosaur fossils. The excellent Hagerman Fossil Beds in Idaho (nps.gov/hafo) has remains of pre-Ice Age mammals and horses. In Oregon, John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (nps.gov/joda) is one of the world&apos;s greatest fossil sites, where more than 2,200 plant and animal species have been discovered.  Your timing is excellent: dinosaurs are invading Portland, Oregon this summer. Oregon Zoo (oregonzoo.org), a walk or train ride from downtown Portland, has life-size moving dinosaurs and walking trails for children. Portland Children&apos;s Museum is offering the chance to don full-size dinosaur feet and make your own footprints - see Travel Portland (travelportland.com) for details. Lastly, if you&apos;re visiting the Oregon Coast, scenic Port Orford has prehistoric gardens with life-size replica dinosaurs hiding in thick rainforest.  Did you know that you can see dinosaur tracks without leaving the UK? Keats Quarry near Swanage in Dorset has dino - possibly diplodocus - footprints over a metre across.

When the American authors of the bestselling Israel Lobby visited the Jewish state last week, the reaction lacked rotten fruit throwing and hysterical outrage. Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer&apos;s book has provoked a stormy reaction worldwide, with accusations of it being anti-Israel, sloppily researched and perpetuating antisemitic conspiracy theories. The professors argue the existence of a pro-Israel lobby which steers US Middle Eastern policy and engineers blanket support for the Jewish state: not good for America or for Israel, they say. If you used a broad brush to paint this picture, you could say that Israelis by and large take a dim view of the professors&apos; work. But let&apos;s compare like with like. The academic duo&apos;s visit confirmed what they had already witnessed through favourable reviews in Ha&apos;aretz newspaper: that the Israeli liberal-left media is more receptive than its American equivalent to the professors&apos; claims. When the US authors appeared on the Israeli TV current affairs show, London and Kirshenbaum, they were subjected to a grilling, but you couldn&apos;t really call it hostile. &quot;There is no betrayal of Israel here&quot;, observed co-host Yaron London after interviewing the two. Commenting on the fact that The Israel Lobby gets a friendlier hearing in Israel than it does from the American Jewish community, London said: &quot;That&apos;s worthy of attention, the ability of Israelis and Israeli expats living in the States almost to shut their mouths... &quot; If the diaspora Jewry doesn&apos;t always want Israel self-righteously talking on its behalf, it seems that the reverse is also true. Some took the professors&apos; visit as a trumpet-blowing opportunity. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, admired Israel&apos;s truly democratic nature in inviting academics &quot;who for several years have been lambasting Israel and American Jews&quot;. Lambasting is an odd term to describe the words of an academic duo who reiterate their belief in a Jewish state at every opportunity (and there have been plenty), and who repeatedly explain that the US pro-Israel lobby is not comprised entirely of American Jews - many of whom do not support it. But in similar free-speech spirit, the Israeli professor Gabi Sheffer explained why he gave permission for Walt and Mearsheimer&apos;s lecture at Jerusalem&apos;s Hebrew university. In view of the Jewish state fighting a proposed academic boycott from the UK and the US, he told Israeli radio: &quot;We cannot refuse to let them come here and voice their opinions. We will not have a part in boycotting professors ... &quot;  Of course not everyone welcomed these visitors. The pro-Israel group Stand With Us were handing out leaflets at the professors&apos; Tel Aviv lecture last week, condemning their work &quot;for its factual distortions and for its innuendos about a Jewish conspiracy in the US&quot;. Gilad, one of the group&apos;s members, later said: &quot;It&apos;s a horrible book, just sugar-coated antisemitism ... &quot; And just as they do in the US, the questions sometimes got spiky: What makes you think you know what&apos;s good for Israel? Don&apos;t you know that your work fuels fiery Islamic radicals? Don&apos;t you think your work helps perpetuate hatred against Jews?  Walt received a round of applause when he told the Tel Aviv audience: &quot;Not being able to discuss these issues is more likely to fuel real conspiracy theories and real hostilities and the way to prevent antisemitism ... is to have an open discussion.&quot; As a result of their visit it&apos;s clear that even if people disagree with the professors, there is a discussion of the subject in Israel.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-16T10:30:00Z", "title": "Rachel Shabi: Walt and Mearsheimer go to Israel", "sentences": ["The pro-Israel group Stand With Us were handing out leaflets at the professors&apos; Tel Aviv lecture last week, condemning their work &quot;for its factual distortions and for its innuendos about a Jewish conspiracy in the US&quot;.", "Walt received a round of applause when he told the Tel Aviv audience: &quot;Not being able to discuss these issues is more likely to fuel real conspiracy theories and real hostilities and the way to prevent antisemitism ... is to have an open discussion.&quot; As a result of their visit it&apos;s clear that even if people disagree with the professors, there is a discussion of the subject in Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/16/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Culture"], "article": "The 30th anniversary of Orientalism has brought with it numerous publications aiming to weaken Edward Said&apos;s project. As I see it they seek to disqualify the writer rather than engage with his arguments, and do not contribute to scholarly debate about his work. I would like to bring forward a contemporary political debate to remind us that Orientalism&apos;s political arguments are still alive and kicking.  As a journalist in Israel, my home country, I frequently found Orientalism to be an effective tool for understanding Israeli discourse, knowledge-construction and the media&apos;s work. In a society which gathers around the army as its focal point and which sees Judaism as a national identity, the Jewish-military discourse emerges almost naturally. Within this discourse, which becomes the society&apos;s common sense, certain (positive) behaviours are linked to the Jews, and certain (negative) behaviours are linked to the Arabs. Giving the media as an example, one needs to remember that within Israeli common sense, the themes of violence, aggressiveness, propaganda and incitement are Arab-oriented, while self-defence, response, restraint and morality are Jewish-Israeli-oriented, and rarely represent Arab behaviour or ways of thinking. Following this, and in order to understand how a hegemonic Jewish discourse is being shaped in a country with 1.4 million Palestinian citizens (who can speak Hebrew and are educated in the state&apos;s schools and universities), it is indeed helpful to come back to Orientalism. According to Said:  &quot;In discussions of the orient, the orient is all absent, whereas one feels the orientalist and what he says as presence ... We must not forget the orientalist&apos;s presence is enabled by the orient&apos;s effective absence&quot;.  The process of producing sociopolitical knowledge about Arabs in Israel could prove the validity of this notion, mostly due to the fact that within the Israeli spheres where this knowledge is being made, Arabs are not allowed. Despite the fact that one-fifth of Israeli citizens are Arabs, the establishment has always preferred to understand the region through Jewish-Zionists&apos; eyes and to assume the task of representing the same Arabs. The prime ministers&apos; advisers for Arab affairs, emissaries dealing with Arab delegations, thinktanks seeking political solutions concerning the Palestinians, the media&apos;s Arab affairs correspondents and Israeli-Arabic radio, television and newspapers outlets have practically been controlled, run and presented by Jews from the state of Israel&apos;s very beginning. Interestingly, due to the sensitivity (or even danger) of adding indigenous &quot;Arab&quot; knowledge and understanding to the Israeli-Jewish perception of &quot;the Arabs&quot;, the Palestinian citizens of Israel emerged as being more suited to &quot;non-Arab&quot; positions. For example, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem Universities, there are no Palestinian citizens of Israel who are regular lecturers in the Middle East faculties, but, surprisingly, they can be found in the faculties of medicine, pharmacy, education, law, sociology and others. Taking high schools as another example for knowledge-construction, it is interesting to note that teachers of the Arabic language in Jewish-Israeli schools are rarely Arabs; an Arabic supervisor from Israel&apos;s ministry of education explained their absence by saying that Arabic is the least suitable subject to be taught by Arabs. These examples show that knowledge about the other was constructed in Israel not only by ignoring it geographically or politically, but also personally. This assisted with the creation and preservation of a discourse which was and still is Jewish and Zionist-oriented, and that immunises Jewish society from being challenged by different or opposing ideas.  The discourse described here cannot explain all processes in Israeli society, but deals with &quot;big practices&quot; that are the general themes in Israeli society. Indeed, out of 160 participants in the 2007 Herzliya conference, addressing Israel&apos;s strategic challenges in the region, one could find two Palestinian citizens of Israel; in the department of Arabic at the Hebrew University there has been one permanent academic staff member who was an Arab during its 82 year history; and Israeli Channel 2 actually has one Arab correspondent in Gaza. However, these exceptions prove the rule since this hybridity, of Palestinians who penetrate Jewish-controlled spheres, is essentially a western-Jewish notion that emerges from its own complexity, understanding and limits. At the end of the day, the minimal presence of the Arab-east in western-Jewish hegemonic discourse in Israel does not make it any less absent.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-17T14:00:00Z", "title": "Yonatan Mendel: Orientalism still matters in modern-day Israel", "sentences": ["For example, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem Universities, there are no Palestinian citizens of Israel who are regular lecturers in the Middle East faculties, but, surprisingly, they can be found in the faculties of medicine, pharmacy, education, law, sociology and others."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/17/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Technology sector", "Technology", "Media", "Business"], "article": "You remember that famous quote: &quot;Everything for the best in this best of all possible worlds.&quot; Well, that defines Tom Friedman&apos;s perspective on Israel and his perspective on the ability of global trade to triumph over the all the world&apos;s ills. Ostensibly, the subject of Friedman&apos;s recent New York Times column was to compare the indomitable economic engine Israel has become with the lumbering &quot;dinosaur&quot; that is Iran. Friedman&apos;s proof positive was Iscar, one of the newer additions to Warren Buffett&apos;s stable of companies. Here is some of his cheerleading:  From outside, Israel looks as if it&apos;s in turmoil, largely because the entire political leadership seems to be under investigation. But Israel is a weak state with a strong civil society. The economy is exploding from the bottom up. Israel&apos;s currency, the shekel, has appreciated nearly 30% against the dollar since the start of 2007. The reason? Israel is a country that is hard-wired to compete in a flat world. It has a population drawn from 100 different countries, speaking 100 different languages, with a business culture that strongly encourages individual imagination and adaptation and where being a nonconformist is the norm. While you were sleeping, Israel has gone from oranges to software, or as they say around here, from Jaffa to Java. \u2026 [Iscar chairman Eitan] Wertheimer is famous for staying close to his customers and the latest technologies. &quot;If you sleep on the floor,&quot; he likes to say, &quot;you never have to worry about falling out of bed.&quot; That kind of hunger explains why, in the first quarter of 2008, the top four economies after America in attracting venture capital for start-ups were: Europe $1.53bn, China $719m, Israel $572m and India $99m, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Israel, with seven million people, attracted almost as much as China, with 1.3 billion.  This kind of Friedmanesque prose makes me feel like I&apos;m reading the work of a good advertising copywriter. He&apos;s something like the Hollywood screenwriter assigned to work in product placement and script plugs on behalf of the film&apos;s corporate sponsors. &quot;From oranges to software, from Jaffa to Java.&quot; It sounds so bubbly, so trite and so superficial. Is Friedman telling us anything new, useful or important? Well, sort of. He&apos;s basically telling us that Israel has a lot of things going for it economically. That&apos;s fine, as far as it goes. But what is he leaving out? A whole lot, it turns out. Naomi Klein places Friedman&apos;s analysis of the Israeli economy in a more balanced perspective:  Put in Friedmanesque terms: Israel went from inventing the networking tools of the &quot;flat world&quot; to selling fences to an apartheid planet. Many of the country&apos;s most successful entrepreneurs are using Israel&apos;s status as a fortressed state, surrounded by furious enemies, as a kind of twenty-four-hour-a-day showroom - a living example of how to enjoy relative safety amid constant war. And the reason Israel is now enjoying supergrowth is that those companies are busily exporting that model to the world.  Another point that Friedman misses is the fact that the benefits of the high-tech industry are largely confined to the area around Tel Aviv and those who live there. If you go outside this geographical region, the Israeli &quot;miracle&quot; doesn&apos;t appear quite so miraculous. The Israeli foreign ministry tells us that 70% of Israeli industrial output is concentrated in the high-tech sector. So what happens when the next tech bubble bursts as it did in 1999 (when the Israeli economy was devastated)? Is it such a good thing to have the Israeli economy so totally dominated by one industry? Friedman also ignores the serious inadequacies in Israel&apos;s public education system noted in this Economist study of the nation&apos;s economy:  Perhaps the most serious threat to Israel&apos;s long-term prosperity, and the one that most troubles ordinary Israelis, is the state of the education system. \u2026 In the OECD&apos;s ... rankings of 57 countries in 2006, focus[ing] on science education, Israeli 15-year-olds came 39th overall. Israel also had the biggest gap between the best and the worst students. Both are bad signs for a country with few natural resources that relies on a knowledge-based economy.  Rory McCarthy, writing in the Guardian, reports that Israel&apos;s Adva Centre released a study, The Cost of Occupation - The Burden of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (pdf), documenting the costs to the Israeli economy of its occupation. The results, as McCarthy related, are staggering:  Israel&apos;s occupied territories and conflict with the Palestinians has undermined the country&apos;s economic growth and has cost at least an extra 36.6bn shekels (\u00a35.7bn) in defence spending over the past two decades \u2026 . Adva&apos;s figures show Israel&apos;s economy grew 43% between 1997 and 2006, well behind world economic growth during that period of 67% and growth of 68% in the US and in the EU. \u2026  Adva said that one in every five Israeli families now ranked as poor, against one in every 10 in the 1970s, which it said was partly a result of the conflict and partly due to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia who have struggled to find work. Social security payments, particularly child allowances, unemployment compensation and income maintenance, were cut significantly between 2001 and 2005, at least in part because of rising defence costs.  &quot;The truth,&quot; reports Adva, &quot;is that the conflict with the Palestinians is like a millstone around the neck of Israel: it undermines economic growth, burdens the budget, limits social development, sullies its vision, hangs heavy on its conscience, harms its international standing, exhausts its army, divides it politically and threatens the future of its existence as a Jewish nation-state.&quot; The problem with Friedman&apos;s view is that he&apos;s trying to make you believe that Israel&apos;s economy is humming along at warp speed with nary a care in sight. But he&apos;s not dealing with a full deck, as the Adva report makes clear. And the next time one of these all&apos;s-for-the-best-in-this-best-of-all-possible-Israels partisans tries to pass off Friedman&apos;s views as gospel, remember to tell them that Adva estimates that Israel diverted $500m per year from all that wonderful economic development in order to fund the occupation. Tell them that Israel, no matter how strong it is, could be far stronger without that &quot;millstone&quot; around its neck. Tell them that the gap between rich and poor, Arab and Jew, religious and secular, might have been far less with that additional economic development. Tell them that many of those Israelis who fall beneath the poverty line might have found jobs had these economic limitations not been imposed. Friedman is a smart guy. But he&apos;s too smart by half if he thinks the pabulum he published tells anywhere near the whole story of Israel&apos;s economic condition.

The Egyptian-brokered truce was intended to end the violence that has killed seven Israelis and more than 400 Palestinians in the 12 months since the Hamas group seized control of Gaza. Israel has promised to halt air strikes and other attacks in return for an end to the regular volleys of rockets and mortars fired into southern Israel by Hamas and several other militant groups. If the truce holds, Israel will gradually begin to ease its punishing blockade of Gaza. While the ceasefire has been welcomed by civilians on both sides - Israelis in the south of the country are eager to see an end to rocket attacks, while Gazans are desperate for more supplies to be allowed into the territory - it remains shaky. The last hours before the truce yesterday were marked by Palestinian rocket and mortar fire and Israeli reprisals. Shortly before the truce took hold, a Hamas militant was killed in an air strike in central Gaza, which Israel claimed targeted a rocket squad. The pact was &quot;fragile and likely to be short-lived&quot;, Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in a speech near Tel Aviv yesterday.&quot;Hamas and other terrorist groups ... have not changed their stripes or turned into lovers of peace,&quot; he said. Today, Olmert&apos;s office announced that he will visit Egypt next Tuesday to meet the country&apos;s president, Hosni Mubarak, for talks agreed several weeks ago. As well as brokering the ceasefire, Cairo is also mediating over the possible return of an Israeli soldier held by militants in Gaza since 2006. The military wing of Hamas, which Israel, the US and EU consider a terrorist organisation, released a statement declaring it was committed to the truce, while warning that it was not a &quot;free gift to the occupiers&quot;, threatening a violent response should Israel not abide by its commitments. It was &quot;fully ready to launch a military strike that will shake the Zionist entity if they do not abide by all the items of the calm [ceasefire] deal&quot;, the statement said. The deal officially extends to all militant groups operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad, which has fired thousands of rockets into Israel, said it was &quot;committed not to act against the interest of our people&quot;. If the ceasefire holds - an earlier one in November 2006 unravelled within weeks - then Israel will allow larger shipments of some supplies to Gaza on Sunday. A week later, Israel is scheduled to further ease restrictions at cargo crossings, which in recent months have been closed to all but humanitarian aid and limited fuel supplies. In a final stage, negotiators are to tackle Hamas&apos;s demand to reopen a major border passage between Gaza and Egypt, and Israel&apos;s insistence that Hamas release its captured soldier, Corporal Gilad Shalit. Gaza has been virtually cut off since Hamas seized control from the more moderate Fatah movement of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in June last year.

At the height of his popularity during the 1990s, as co-host of the weekly Popolitica current affairs programme, he was known as Archie Bunker, after the cantankerous patriarch of the American TV comedy, All in the Family. Whether or not people agreed with him, they could not ignore him. Even his enemies were wont to quote the ancient rabbinic saw that &quot;his mouth spoke what his heart felt&quot;. The pugnacious and fast-talking Lapid was born Tomislav Lempel in Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, to Hungarian-Jewish parents. After his father, Bela, a lawyer and journalist, was taken away by the Gestapo in 1943 and never seen again, he spent the rest of the war in the Budapest ghetto. These experiences made an indelible mark on the youngster. He later said: &quot;My whole life is a response to the Holocaust.&quot; In 1948, he emigrated with his mother, Katarina, to the newly formed state of Israel, served in the military and studied law at Tel Aviv University. He entered journalism with a Hungarian-language newspaper, Uj Kelet, moving in 1955 to the national daily Maariv, which, in 1967, appointed him editor of a new woman&apos;s journal. He gained a reputation as a combative, even curmudgeonly, media personality who was unafraid to state his opinion and to fight for what he thought was right. In 1979 he was appointed chairman of the Israel Broadcasting Authority, a post he held for five years. He returned to Maariv as a senior editor and writer while simultaneously co-hosting Popolitica. One of Lapid&apos;s constant targets was the growing power in Israel of the ultra-Orthodox community and its increasing demands for public money, despite the fact that it refused to send its men into the armed forces or pay its share of national insurance. At one point he referred to them in public as parasites, a term used by Hitler against the Jews. Politically of the liberal-right, he was not afraid to describe the settlers in the occupied territories as fascists. In 1999 he was asked to lead the secular Shinui (or &quot;Change&quot;) party into a general election. The party initially won six seats, rising to 15 in the 2003 election, enabling it to join the coalition government of Ariel Sharon - on condition that the rival Shas party was excluded. Lapid himself was appointed minister of justice and deputy prime minister. During his short term of office, he introduced laws to secularise the legal system. But controversy within his party led to his resignation in 2004, and his appointment as chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and museum. In many ways, Lapid was the quint-essential Israeli success story. He could recall how his mother hid him in a sewer to save him from the Nazis, and how he counted every year of his life thereafter as a gift. His common touch made him one of Israel&apos;s most influential media figures, a position reinforced by his writings - plays, guidebooks and even a cookbook (of kosher Hungarian dishes) - as well as his chairmanship of the Israel chess association. He is survived by his wife Shulamit, a well-known author, son Yair and daughter Merav.

The officer was reported to be at least 100 metres from the aircraft. &quot;This was in no way an assassination attempt,&quot; an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, told Reuters. He said the police officer had killed himself. The incident came at a time of mounting concern over the ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Two Palestinians, including a commander of the Islamic Jihad militant group, were killed during an Israeli military raid in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, yesterday. Several hours later Islamic Jihad fired four rockets from Gaza towards the southern Israeli town of Sderot, slightly injuring two people.  The rocket fire came on the sixth day of what was supposed to be a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas said it was sticking to the agreement but it was not clear whether Israel would respond. &quot;It is essential for the ceasefire, for calm to be sustained,&quot; said the appointed Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, in Berlin. The ceasefire is also threatened by a political crisis within Israel. Olmert faces the possible collapse of his ruling coalition today when politicians vote on a preliminary reading of a bill to dissolve the Knesset, Israel&apos;s parliament. The Labour party, a key force in the ruling coalition and led by the defence minister, Ehud Barak, has promised to vote in favour. Barak sees himself as a challenger for the premiership and last month called on Olmert to quit after embarrassing testimony was given in the latest corruption investigation against the prime minister.  Olmert has told members of his Kadima party he will sack Labour ministers who support the bill, including Barak, who is not an MP.  &quot;I won&apos;t accept a situation in which Labour ministers are trying to topple the government yet staying in it,&quot; Olmert said at a Kadima meeting on Monday. Early elections would probably see Labour and Kadima lose out to the rightwing Likud party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "Gunshot starts panic as Sarkozy leaves Israel", "sentences": ["Bodyguards rushed Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the visiting French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to safety yesterday after an Israeli police officer shot himself in the head during a departure ceremony at Tel Aviv airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/france.nicolassarkozy"}, {"tags": ["Islam", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "Over the years, I have witnessed my faith dwindle and unravel. But long after my spirited embrace of alcohol, my &quot;sinful&quot; attitude to sex, my loss of faith in the temple of organised religion and my agnosticism and indifference towards the supreme being, one bizarre artefact of faith \u2013 a sacred cow that refused to be slaughtered \u2013 clung on with obstinate pig-headedness: a distaste for pork. For years, this irrational aversion intrigued and amused my wife. Katleen would wonder why it was that many secular Muslims would drink alcohol and commit other non-orthodox acts, but never touch pork. And I would watch her with awe-struck fascination as she tucked into a spaghetti carbonara, with apparent enjoyment. My theory was that, for believing but non-practising Muslims, there is nothing that can really take the place of alcohol \u2013 even hashish or marijuana, which is consumed by many Muslims as an alternative because it is not explicitly prohibited, is not the same as a glass of wine or beer. My friends tend to agree with this analysis. &quot;If you don&apos;t drink you don&apos;t drink&quot;, remarked Ahmed, an Egyptian in Paris who is a great connoisseur of beers, rakis and ouzos. &quot;But as for pork, there are other types of meat.&quot;  Then, there&apos;s the psychological barrier that even the most lapsed Muslim must grapple with. &quot;I think all the talk we hear in childhood of how pigs are bred in zebala (rubbish) areas and how they feed on garbage revolts us&quot;, said Abdou, a Cairene who has developed a taste for certain types of pig meat, but not others.  In fact, eating pork for Muslims is not merely tantamount to eating dogs for westerners, in certain cases, we could go as far as to liken it to consuming cockroaches \u2013 so unclean is the image of these animals.  Some Muslims rationalise their porkophobia by explaining that pigs are dangerous to eat, especially in hot climates, but pork is no more risky, at least in the modern world, than beef and poultry. The injunction may have originally been connected to health concerns, environmental worries in an arid climate where foraging pigs could destroy precious grazing land, or as a simple test of faith and obedience. &quot;We are not a pig-friendly people&quot;, Abdou observed.  And, indeed, we&apos;re not. At school in England, I could tell that, unlike Aladdin and Sinbad, the Three Little Pigs was certainly not a Muslim fairytale. No self-respecting Muslim wolf would be wasting his breath, huffing and puffing, just to get his claws on some poor pig&apos;s bacon. A Muslim wolf would be far more interested in skewering Mary&apos;s little lamb to make mouth-watering kebabs. Miss Piggy would never have got past the audition couch for the Muslim version of the Muppet Show \u2013 even for comic effect. Muslim casters may have hired instead Miss Bully, a doe-eyed bovine beauty who flies into sudden fits of rage like a bull in a china shop.  That said, pigs don&apos;t get a completely smooth ride in western culture. In George Orwell&apos;s Animal Farm, the pigs are duplicitous hypocrites who end up taking the farm over from the humans. In England, the police are not so affectionately known as &quot;pigs&quot;. The animal is used a term of insult, as in &quot;male, chauvinist pig&quot;, or &quot;capitalist swine&quot;. And people greet unwelcome comments with snorts of derision. Nevertheless, this more sympathetic view of pigs may have influenced Jews, despite the fact that pork is prohibited by both kosher and halal rules alike, to adopt a more relaxed attitude to pork. &quot;Pork evokes no special image in my mind. Pigs are cute. I just don&apos;t eat &apos;em&quot;, Debby, an American Jew, said. &quot;Almost all of the Jews I know eat pork&quot;, Hagay, an Israeli artist, told me. &quot;My grandmother even used to say: &apos;If you&apos;re going to eat pork, you might as well have the fat drip down your chin.&apos;&quot; That said, many Jews share the Muslim kneejerk horror and revulsion towards pigs. &quot;Both my parents can&apos;t stand the idea of pork&quot;, admitted Gal, a student in Tel Aviv. &quot;Neither of them are particularly religious \u2026 but both my mother and my father find the idea of eating pig repulsive.&quot; And revulsion could be the key to my longstanding distaste for pork. I still clearly recall my first taste of pig&apos;s meat. On my second day at school in England, the dinner lady offered me a slice of Hard to Ascertain Meat (or Ham, for short) which had provoked my curiosity because it looked a bit like the luncheon cold-cuts we ate in Egypt. I don&apos;t much recall the actual taste, but I do remember the shocking aftertaste when my mother and father \u2013 who had casually been inquiring about my new school experience \u2013 informed me that I&apos;d probably consumed ham. Although my parents were relaxed about it and explained that I wasn&apos;t to blame for it was an accident, I sensed disgust wash over me. Since then, a recurring question I have asked in restaurants around the world is: does this contain pork? Sometimes, I&apos;ve even resorted to mime and snorting to get my point across. I recall the spellbound fascination with which I regarded an old Cairo friend as he tucked into the Italian salamis and hams he had recently developed a taste for. In recent years, I have got the better of my demons and now eat pork, although there are still certain types of pig&apos;s meat I cannot stomach. As someone who prides himself on his culinary intrepidness, I am pleased with this small victory for gastronomic rationality. And now I can finally bring home the bacon!", "publicationDate": "2008-07-02T12:40:00Z", "title": "Khaled Diab: Why don't lapsed Muslims eat pork?", "sentences": ["&quot;Both my parents can&apos;t stand the idea of pork&quot;, admitted Gal, a student in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/02/islam.religion"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa"], "article": "Everyone recalls, whether approvingly or critically, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat&apos;s audacious trip to Jerusalem to talk peace at the Israeli Knesset. But history should find a page in its annals for, in my opinion, an even more courageous Egyptian. More than three years before Sadat&apos;s famous foray into the unknown, at a time when the only Arabs and Israelis who met were soldiers or spies, Sana Hasan, a PhD student in her mid-20s, went to Israel as the Arab world&apos;s first, albeit unofficial and ostracised, peace envoy and probably its most unusual. Her six-week trip turned into a three-year sojourn, from 1974 to 1977, in which she seems to have met, well, just about everyone in Israel. Her memoirs of her odyssey, entitled Enemy in the Promised Land, provide fascinating insights into the dynamics and diversity of Israeli society \u2013 replacing the faceless &quot;enemy&quot; with a dizzying parade of characters and individuals.  Hasan&apos;s stay came at a time when Egypt and Israel were literally at war. Although the 1973 war was officially over, the two armies still nervously faced each other across the ceasefire lines. This meant that Hasan faced the very real possibility of being stripped of her nationality or being arrested as a spy in Israel. As it turns out, after five years of exile, she received red-carpet treatment on her return to Egypt after the Camp David peace accords.  Hasan was not naive and entertained no illusions about what her personal peace mission could achieve: &quot;In the face of Phantom jets and the interests of superpowers, individual action was pathetic.&quot;  One thing that immediately struck Hasan, as it did me more than three decades later, is how strangely familiar Israel seemed. She had expected Israel&apos;s official capital to be &quot;a grand metropolis, the gleaming jewel of Israeli dominion and efficiency \u2026 Instead, Tel Aviv resembled a Middle Eastern bazaar.&quot; She discovered plenty in common between her own compatriots and Israelis. &quot;Israelis seemed to have the same healthy, if somewhat exaggerated, scepticism of authority and\u2026 to believe that the law applied to everyone except themselves.&quot;  Another area of common ground I uncovered was the absolute importance of family to Israelis and Arabs alike, although Israelis tend to value individuality more.  As for Israel&apos;s legendary efficiency, something Arabs both admire and fear, the intrepid Egyptian was soon disabused of any notions that it actually existed in most spheres of daily life. An Egyptian Jewish bank clerk told her that Israeli bureaucrats worked 8-0-4 hours per day: arrive at eight, do zero work, and leave at four.  One area where Egyptians and Israelis part company is in the realm of social niceties and refinements \u2013 something which, with her upper-class upbringing and rebellious nature, was both intriguing and grating. Other differences are often more aspirational than actual. One such area is the status of women. In fact, Hasan, a hardcore feminist, was dismayed by the role of women on supposedly progressive kibbutzim. &quot;It took me a while to realise that the glamorous image of women pioneers ploughing fields and carting manure\u2026 was largely mythical.&quot; Determined to live her principles, rebel against her aristocratic background and prove to the Israelis that she was not some soft-touch Egyptian woman, she insisted on doing all the heavy-duty jobs reserved for the men.  Hasan also discovered that the notion of sexual liberation was often skin-deep, even among progressive kibbutzim. &quot;Their contempt for the institution of marriage and for the cult of virginity did not include an ideology of free love,&quot; she observed. In addition to the better aspects of Israeli society, Hasan got plenty of opportunity to explore all the warts. One was the discrimination endured by Oriental Jews. &quot;We lived side by side with [Muslims] with no problems, and believe me the goyim were kinder to us than Israeli Jews are here,&quot; complained one Georgian Jew. On the next rung down from Mizrahi Jews stood the Palestinian citizens of Israel. Despite their declared equality under the law, the reality Hasan found was very different. She was shocked at the casual disdain and even racism expressed by Israeli Jews towards Palestinians, discrimination in education and the job market, and how emergency security measures and some questionable laws had been exploited to deprive them of their land.  Although I found the situation to have improved in the intervening years, the status of the Palestinian citizens of Israel is still fairly precarious. In fact, Hasan experienced the same unease I felt when I could move freely around the West Bank while my Palestinian hosts needed permits to go anywhere.  To be allowed to take part in society, some Palestinians tried to assimilate fully into Israeli culture. Wahib, one student from an upper middle class family, boasted that he spoke better Hebrew than Arabic. &quot;I don&apos;t feel torn,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I&apos;m a Palestinian first, then a Christian, then an Israeli.&quot; His father, who said he had raised his children to keep their heads down, said: &quot;Politics can be very hard on us. We are strangers in our own land.&quot; On the Israeli side, many of the seeds of the current crisis could already be discerned by Hasan more than three decades ago. On visiting, which paved the way for the religious settler movement in the West Bank, she feared that the territories captured in 1967 would soon go the way of those taken in 1948, which would shatter prospects for peace. The intransigence of the mainstream politicians also filled her with foreboding. Both Menachem Begin, on the right, and Golda Meir, on the left, expressed their opposition to giving up the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.  What Hasan learnt during her time in Israel helped her humanise the society and develop an appreciation and even love for the people and the place. But it also filled her with despair. &quot;I shed my optimistic faith in the infinite power of rational discourse to bring about concord between Jews and Arabs,&quot; she admits. I have not yet reached that point and hope that dialogue and empathy can move us along the slow path to peace.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-06T09:00:00Z", "title": "Khaled Diab: Sana Hasan's message is still relevant today", "sentences": ["She had expected Israel&apos;s official capital to be &quot;a grand metropolis, the gleaming jewel of Israeli dominion and efficiency \u2026 Instead, Tel Aviv resembled a Middle Eastern bazaar.&quot; She discovered plenty in common between her own compatriots and Israelis."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/06/egypt.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "International court of justice"], "article": "Israeli side: Alfe Menashe Six years ago, when Stan and Joyce Freedman retired they left their home in Edgware, north London, took Israeli citizenship and bought a plot of land on a hilltop in a small but popular sun-drenched Israeli community where their daughter already had a house. They built a three-bedroom home with a breezy patio offering views to the east across the hills of the West Bank and west towards the apartment blocks of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean beyond. They named their new home Tulip Cottage and attached a sign next to the front door, which reads in part: &quot;We have no enemies, only friends.&quot;  &quot;There was nothing here when we first came to this street,&quot; said Mr Freedman, 75, who worked as an executive driver in Britain, chauffeuring senior businessmen and politicians, including many high-profile Israelis. Sitting in the shade of his patio he described how the house was constructed to their specifications in just six months. Now their street is full of houses and families. &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful life and the neighbours are fantastic,&quot; he said. &quot;The quality of life is amazing,&quot; said Mrs Freedman, 76. The town they chose to live in is Alfe Menashe, a fast-growing community of about 7,000 Jewish Israelis who make up what is in fact a settlement, built about two miles into the occupied West Bank, east of the large Palestinian city of Qalqilya. Alfe Menashe was first established in 1983 and quickly began to attract secular middle-class Israelis looking for cheaper housing and a good quality of life, not far from the major towns of central Israel. Today, Alfe Menashe boasts large hillside houses with broad views, neat streets with carefully tended lawns, thousands of trees and plants and a large sports complex with two pools and several tennis courts. There is another element to Alfe Menashe&apos;s success. On all sides of the settlement, save for a narrow strip that leads into Israel, there is the 50-metre wide West Bank barrier.  Israel says it is intended to keep out suicide bombers and prevent terrorist attacks. But the barrier also crosses into the West Bank and surrounds many settlements such as Alfe Menashe, even though all settlements on occupied Palestinian land are widely regarded as illegal under international law. The barrier unilaterally takes at least 9.5% of the West Bank on to the &quot;Israeli&quot; side and in the case of Alfe Menashe it appears, at least to the residents themselves, to have guaranteed the settlement as part of a future Israel in any final peace deal with the Palestinians.  Four years ago this week, the international court of justice said in an advisory opinion that the barrier was illegal where it crossed into the West Bank and should be torn down. But construction continues. &quot;To my mind we have got to have it. We have no other option,&quot; said Mr Freedman, discussing the barrier. As far as he is concerned Alfe Menashe&apos;s future is clear. &quot;This is now Israel and it won&apos;t go back. It can&apos;t go back,&quot; he said. &quot;It will never go back.&quot; Since the settlement is on a hilltop with views of Tel Aviv, he said, it is now a strategic asset that might be used to fire rockets into Israel if it were ever returned. As he spoke there was the sound of an industrial digger on a nearby hill where builders are putting up a new series of apartment blocks as the settlement continues to expand. Beneath the construction work is a poster of an attractive woman and words, in Hebrew: &quot;Building quality of life.&quot; Originally the barrier route did not encircle Alfe Menashe but followed the Green Line, the 1949 armistice line between Israel and the Arab armies, and excluded most settlements. But Alfe Menashe&apos;s mayor, Hisdai Eliezer, worked hard to change the route, even bringing the then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to the settlement to hear the case for himself.  The result was not only that Alfe Menashe was brought on the &quot;Israeli&quot; side, but along with it land for the settlement to expand. However, it also brought in five nearby Palestinian villages that were cut off in a closed area. Those villages&apos; 1,200 residents now require short-term &quot;permanent resident cards&quot; to live in their own homes. This has severely disrupted their access to health and educational facilities and created a situation where friends and families require special permits to visit. In a rare ruling, Israel&apos;s high court said in September 2005 that it found no &quot;decisive security-military reason&quot; for the path of the barrier encircling the villages. It said: &quot;The enclave creates a chokehold around the villages. It seriously damages the entire fabric of life.&quot; The court then ordered that an alternative route be considered. However, nearly three years later, the path of the barrier has not been changed. From his office at the heart of the settlement, Mayor Eliezer talked about his plans to double Alfe Menashe&apos;s population within a few years to up to 15,000. A secular retired lieutenant colonel and former businessman, Eliezer has lived in Alfe Menashe for 18 years. &quot;It&apos;s quite obvious that Alfe Menashe cannot be bargained over,&quot; he said. &quot;The people here don&apos;t feel like settlers. They moved here not for political reasons but for quality of life at a reasonable price.&quot; Houses in the settlement were once regularly advertised as being &quot;five minutes from Kfar Saba&quot; - one of the main towns in central Israel. He grew up believing the Jewish people had the right to settle what he called all the Land of Israel, including the West Bank, but said he grew more pragmatic over time and now saw the barrier as a likely future border. &quot;I saw the complete Land of Israel as something you should die for,&quot; he said. &quot;Over many years you change your opinions and concepts according to the changing reality.&quot;  Yet he said he believed the international community, particularly Europe, was unfairly biased against Israel: &quot;I definitely think our right to the West Bank is a historical, given right. The fact that the Palestinians have been living there for 100 years or so doesn&apos;t give them the edge over us.&quot; There are now more than 450,000 settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and construction of settler homes continues apace, despite the peace talks with the Palestinians and Israel&apos;s commitments under the American-led road map to freeze all settlement activity. The majority of settlers have come in the years since the 1993 Oslo accords, the supposedly groundbreaking deal that was to lead to an independent Palestinian state. Hagit Ofran, who runs the Settlement Watch programme at the Israeli group Peace Now, argues that the barrier was designed not only to protect Israel but also to protect many of the settlers, who are now included within the barrier&apos;s reach.  She advocates a two-state solution, in which Israelis and Palestinians agree the future border that would divide them. &quot;We cannot continue to control the territories,&quot; she said. &quot;For Israel a unilateral division is also not a solution because it is not going to be accepted by the Palestinians. You cannot have a Palestinian state with all these enclaves where they don&apos;t get their full lands back.&quot; Stan and Joyce Freedman think a peace deal with the Palestinians is unlikely in the short term. Mr Freedman, who voted for the rightwing Likud party two years ago, draws his own distinction between his settlement and others deeper in the West Bank. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with settlements that put up a single hut in the middle of nowhere and have 40 soldiers to guard it,&quot; he said. &quot;We are in Israel. We are not in the West Bank, as they say. I don&apos;t consider myself a settler. I&apos;m an immigrant.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-07-06T23:01:00Z", "title": "One wall, two very different views - life on either side of the great divide", "sentences": ["They built a three-bedroom home with a breezy patio offering views to the east across the hills of the West Bank and west towards the apartment blocks of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean beyond.", "&quot;It will never go back.&quot; Since the settlement is on a hilltop with views of Tel Aviv, he said, it is now a strategic asset that might be used to fire rockets into Israel if it were ever returned."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/07/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The bus to the settlement of Kiryat Arba cuts deep inside the West Bank, prompting the operators to take heavy security measures. Thick sheets of bulletproof glass shield the passengers from the perceived threat, but the opaque texture makes it impossible to see more than vague outlines and shapes outside the window.  The effect is to throw up yet one more  obstacle in the task of opening the eyes of the Israeli public to the harsh reality of life in the Occupied Territories. Despite the general perception that Israeli Jews are under constant threat of attack when they venture into the Wild West Bank, a group of dedicated volunteers from the Villages Group put paid to that myth on their regular solidarity visits to local Palestinian farmers. &quot;Perhaps we cannot bring about a general peace,&quot; reads their website, &quot;but we can perform deeds of peace.&quot; The motto was brought to life on Sunday, which I spent shadowing the volunteers as they did the rounds of embattled Palestinian villagers, performing acts of pastoral care much like a lay rabbi or vicar visiting their flock. The twist here, of course, was that the Villages Group team were all Jewish, and those they visited decidedly not so.  &quot;I&apos;m a pessimist,&quot; said Abu Sami as he sat in his tent discussing his children&apos;s future. &quot;The reality here is black.&quot; A lifetime under the cosh of Israeli rule has left an indelible imprint on his psyche. &quot;I don&apos;t see a positive change ever coming from the Israeli side,&quot; he said. &quot;First they conquered the coast \u2013 Haifa, Tel Aviv, and so on \u2013 and now they&apos;ve moved inland.&quot; The only silver lining in the clouds that permanently hang over his fields is the outreach work carried out by Ehud, Noam and Elad, who do their best to alleviate the suffering of Abu Sami and his family. The Israeli authorities have refused to connect Abu Sami&apos;s meagre dwelling to the national grid, on the grounds that he has no permission to build there (&quot;yet illegal settler outposts are supplied with water and electricity within days of being erected,&quot; notes Ehud dryly).  The Villages Group volunteers raised funds for solar panels and a wind turbine, providing the basic electrical needs for the family, such as lighting and refrigeration. Their efforts have borne fruit, both in terms of bettering the family&apos;s standard of living, as well as breaking down the wall of silence that exists between the majority of Israelis and Palestinians.  &quot;We don&apos;t talk politics [when we come to visit],&quot; said Ehud. &quot;We&apos;re here to help with the everyday situation; if we think of politics, then there&apos;s no motivation to carry on with our work.&quot;  While they were quick to dismiss the chances of bringing about political change, they have still managed to set off something of a chain reaction with their work. &quot;Firstly&quot;, explained Ehud, &quot;we create a different reality for ourselves; as you can see, I don&apos;t live in conflict with the Palestinians. Secondly, we do see changes over time. [Thanks to the work of human rights groups], the army and settlers are far less free than ten years ago to act as they please; similarly there has been success in delaying the construction of the separation barrier for over three years in certain places.&quot; But for every small step forward Ehud and his colleagues make in terms of bridge building, the Israeli government and the IDF make ten massive leaps back. We visited the cave village of Mukfara, whose recently-built, minuscule mosque has just been issued with a demolition order by the army. &quot;Settlers build illegally day after day,&quot; said Mahmud Hammada, the muchtar of the hamlet, &quot;whilst we are on our recognised land yet still cannot even build a mosque in which to pray.&quot;  The authorities&apos; complicity in the crimes of the ever-expanding settlements was noted by Hafez, a resident of nearby Tiwani, who has long given up on trusting the local police to protect his family from settler attacks. &quot;The police do nothing, so we don&apos;t even bother reporting the attacks anymore,&quot; he said flatly. The attacks include settlers beating farmers as they cultivate their land, he said, and even opening fire on them and stoning their children as they walk to school.  Hanging on his wall was a framed certificate from the Alternative to Violence Project workshop he attended, though what practical alternative exists was not entirely clear. With no one in power to whom he can turn, &quot;all we can do when they terrorise us either stay and get hurt, or run away&quot;, he said.  Against such a vicious and vindictive backdrop, the Villages Group&apos;s work appears akin to the boy desperately trying to plug the dyke with his fingers. Nevertheless, without efforts such as theirs, there would be even less reason for the likes of Hafez, Abu Sami and Mahmud to believe in an &quot;alternative to violence&quot;.  The majority of Israelis gloss over the suffering of the Palestinians, either because they&apos;ve got problems closer to home to worry about, or because - like the bus passengers - they view the situation through bulletproof spectacles. Ehud, Noam and Elad are in a tiny minority, but they refuse to let the hopelessness of the situation stand in the way of their vital and much appreciated work.

But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president, dismissed the threat of war as a &quot;silly joke&quot;, even as he again rejected the idea that Iran halt uranium enrichment - the key demand of the international community repeated at the G8 summit in Japan. The strongest language came from Ali Shirazi, an aide to Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has ultimate say over the most sensitive issues. &quot;The first US shot against Iran would set the United States&apos; vital interests in the world on fire,&quot; said Shirazi, a cleric who is Khamenei&apos;s representative to the elite Revolutionary Guards naval forces. &quot;Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in Iran&apos;s crushing response,&quot; he said, the Fars news agency reported. Analysts said that while Iran has often warned of a crushing response to any aggression, specific warnings of this kind are unusual. The phrase echoed threats made by Saddam Hussein against Israel on the eve of the 1991 Gulf war. It was the latest in a series of now almost daily exchanges over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme including signals from Israel and the US that they would not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. Washington and its allies accuse Iran of secretly working to develop a nuclear weapon. Tehran says it has no military ambitions and is simply seeking to generate power for civil purposes. Shirazi&apos;s remarks came as Revolutionary Guard missile and naval units began war games - codenamed The Great Prophet III - aimed at &quot;improving the combat capability&quot; of the forces. The Guards are responsible for Iran&apos;s most significant ballistic missiles including the Shahab-3, whose range puts Israel and US bases in the Gulf within reach. Ahmadinejad told a news conference in Malaysia that he hoped to see a fresh approach by the next US administration to make up for the &quot;domineering hegemony&quot; of George Bush. &quot;I assure you that there won&apos;t be any war in the future,&quot; he said, predicting that Israel&apos;s &quot;regime&quot; would collapse without the need for Iranian action. He dismissed the idea of war as &quot;a silly joke.&quot; The US was no longer in a position to attack Iran. &quot;In the US, his wise scholars will not allow Mr Bush to commit political suicide and of course the economic, political and military situation will not allow Mr Bush to do that,&quot; he said. Ahmadinejad also told the leaders of the G8 that their policies would &quot;accelerate them along the road to a precipice&quot; and reiterated he would not accept demands to stop enriching uranium, which can be used as fuel for nuclear power plants and to make warheads if refined to a higher degree. Despite these comments, diplomacy is still being actively pursued. Javier Solana, the EU&apos;s foreign policy chief, is to return to Iran for talks with its top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, before the end of the month, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, told reporters at the G8 summit. Solana presented Iran with a revised package of economic, technical and political incentives last month on behalf of the five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany. Crucially, the package includes an offer of assistance with civilian nuclear technology that has been widely publicised in the Iranian media and appears to have helped stimulate a lively internal debate among the country&apos;s leaders. Solana described Tehran&apos;s weekend response as a &quot;complicated and difficult letter that must be thoroughly analysed&quot;.

Previously unseen documents, postcards, sketches and personal belongings of the Czech-Jewish writer, who wrote in German, have been gathering dust in the home of Esther Hoffe, the former secretary of Kafka&apos;s friend and executor Max Brod since his death in 1968. Hoffe&apos;s refusal to relinquish the documents led to a literary game of cat and mouse between her and the state of Israel, under pressure from the country&apos;s cultural elite, which on one occasion even led to her arrest on suspicion of smuggling Kafka&apos;s writings out of the country. Now, following her death at the age of 101, Kafka lovers hope the row may have come to an end. Researchers are ready to pounce on the contents of Hoffe&apos;s flat, fully expecting the items will throw new light on the mysterious writer who died at the age of 41, as well as his friendship with Brod, his greatest champion. But authorities in Tel Aviv have warned that the papers, with their high sulphuric acid content, may have stood up poorly to conditions in Hoffe&apos;s damp flat in the centre of Tel Aviv and to the hordes of cats and dogs which she kept until two years ago when health inspectors intervened after neighbours complained about the stench. The items have a complex provenance reaching back to 1924, when Kafka died of tuberculosis in Vienna. Brod took over Kafka&apos;s estate, including several unpublished manuscripts, and famously defied his friend&apos;s instructions to burn them. In 1939, the night before the Nazis entered Prague, Brod fled the city with two suitcases containing what he could of the estate. He escaped via Romania to Palestine, later moving the archive to the safety of Switzerland during the Suez crisis in 1956. In 1961 he gave most of the manuscripts to the Bodleian library at Oxford University at the request of Kafka&apos;s heirs, but kept hold of The Trial because he said it had been a gift to him from Kafka. Nearly 30 years later, Hoffe sold the manuscript of Kafka&apos;s novel for a record \u00a31m at Sotheby&apos;s. Few doubt that there are other treasures waiting to be found, due to tantalising utterances Hoffe made over the years about Brod&apos;s estate. On one occasion, at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben-Gurion airport, Hoffe was arrested on suspicion of illegally smuggling valuable archive material out of the country. Police found letters by Kafka as well as his travel journal in her luggage. Following that incident she allowed employees from Israel&apos;s state archive to catalogue the items she had, but was accused of holding back key documents. Repeated attempts by academics to persuade her to give the items in her possession to the national library in Jerusalem failed. The German publisher Artemis and Winkler paid Hoffe a five-figure advance for Brod&apos;s diaries in the 1980s, but has still to receive them. Hoffe let it be known in 1993 that she had transferred them to a bank vault in Tel Aviv to which she is still believed to have had access when she died. The legal battle between the publisher and her heirs is still in progress. &quot;Esther was always afraid that someone would steal these materials from her,&quot; Avital Ben Horin, a close friend of Brod&apos;s, told Ha&apos;aretz, the Tel Aviv daily. Describing Hoffe&apos;s flat as an &quot;unsuitable&quot; location for the estate because of Tel Aviv&apos;s humidity, she added: &quot;But it was impossible to convince her&quot;. Puzzle Commentators have remarked that the story could have stemmed from Kafka&apos;s own pen. Kafka, the man still considered a literary puzzle 84 years after his death, &quot;is causing the world to hold its breath,&quot; Germany&apos;s Die Welt newspaper wrote. Ha&apos;aretz, which broke the story, called it &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;, turning to the very phrase inspired by Kafka&apos;s own writings to describe something which is elusive and menacingly complex. Much to the frustration of academics, archivists and the Israeli government, Hoffe, who became Brod&apos;s lover following the death of his wife, was said to have jealously clung to the papers which Brod left to her in his will because of her wish to protect intimate details of Brod&apos;s life. It will now be up to her septuagenarian daughters, Ruth and Hava, to decide on the estate&apos;s fate. But according to reports, Israeli authorities have indicated their willingness to intervene to save what is considered an invaluable piece of Jewish cultural heritage. &quot;This is really very exciting, particularly if there are documents left that have not yet been published,&quot; said Professor Freddie Rokem, a lecturer in theatre arts at Tel Aviv University, who organised a conference to honour Brod on his 100th anniversary in 1984. &quot;Hoffe more or less inherited the suitcase of Kafka papers from Brod. The question is whether she knew how much it was worth from the beginning, or did she really only learn its true value later on?&quot; Josef Cermak, author of several books on Kafka, said he hoped the release of the items might help clear up quarrels in the literary world in this, the 125th anniversary of his birth, which is being marked with events around the globe. &quot;There are so many mistruths which have been written about Kafka. For academic purposes it is crucial that we get to see what the unpredictable Miss Hoffe has kept from us for so long.&quot; Profile Franz Kafka was born in Prague in 1883 into a middle-class Jewish family. His most famous novel, The Trial, published in 1925, became a symbol of 20th-century totalitarianism and gave birth to the word &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;, used to describe everything from entrapment in bureaucracy to the absurdity of life. His other works included The Metamorphosis (1915) and The Castle (1926). The themes of alienation, persecution, and hopelessness run through his writing, which attracted little attention until after his death in 1924 from tuberculosis in a sanitorium near Vienna, aged 41.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-09T00:20:00Z", "title": "End of a Kafkaesque nightmare: writer's papers finally come to light", "sentences": ["Scholars of the 20th-century writer Franz Kafka were in a state of suspense last night at the news that the remains of his estate, which have been hoarded in a Tel Aviv flat for decades, may soon be revealed.", "But authorities in Tel Aviv have warned that the papers, with their high sulphuric acid content, may have stood up poorly to conditions in Hoffe&apos;s damp flat in the centre of Tel Aviv and to the hordes of cats and dogs which she kept until two years ago when health inspectors intervened after neighbours complained about the stench.", "On one occasion, at Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben-Gurion airport, Hoffe was arrested on suspicion of illegally smuggling valuable archive material out of the country.", "Hoffe let it be known in 1993 that she had transferred them to a bank vault in Tel Aviv to which she is still believed to have had access when she died.", "&quot;Esther was always afraid that someone would steal these materials from her,&quot; Avital Ben Horin, a close friend of Brod&apos;s, told Ha&apos;aretz, the Tel Aviv daily.", "Describing Hoffe&apos;s flat as an &quot;unsuitable&quot; location for the estate because of Tel Aviv&apos;s humidity, she added: &quot;But it was impossible to convince her&quot;.", "&quot;This is really very exciting, particularly if there are documents left that have not yet been published,&quot; said Professor Freddie Rokem, a lecturer in theatre arts at Tel Aviv University, who organised a conference to honour Brod on his 100th anniversary in 1984."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/09/news.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "World news"], "article": "Just in case there was any ambiguity about Iran&apos;s missile test today in the Hormuz Straits, the air force chief, General Hossein Salami, put any lingering uncertainty to rest. Salami said the tests of long- and medium- range missiles were intended to demonstrate Iranian resolve &quot;against enemies who in recent weeks have threatened Iran with a harsh language&quot;. There is no question that the principal enemy the Iranian government has in mind is Israel. Israel is within range of the Shahab 3 missile, one of the weapons tested today. And Israel is the only country currently employing &quot;harsh language&quot; about Iran. George Bush repeatedly says &quot;all options are on the table&quot; but that diplomacy is his administration&apos;s favoured approach. Israeli officials, by contrast, have said explicitly they would carry out air strikes to prevent Iran building nuclear weapons. Shaul Mofaz, a cabinet minister and former army chief, has said Israel would have &quot;no choice&quot; but to carry out an attack. The EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, is due back in Tehran soon to discuss a proposed deal offering economic, energy and diplomatic incentives in return for suspension of uranium enrichment. The signs so far are not good. Iran&apos;s initial response appears to have been a polemic that ignored the issue of suspension. Israel has always believed that negotiations with Iran were doomed to failure and that the ruling clerics had made a strategic decision to go nuclear which they would not abandon.  Israeli officials had hoped the Bush administration would take action, but they now have doubts and are considering their own unilateral military options.  Those options are limited. Israeli planes would have to fly a long way to reach their targets, presuming Jordan would not give its approval for overflights. The strikes would be aimed at deeply buried targets, with no certainty that all Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities are known to Israeli intelligence. The strikes could spur Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions while failing to hobble them.  But Israel&apos;s government believes it has no choice but to strike in the hope of slowing down the programme, even if it has to strike again and again to keep it in check. It is derisive about Iran&apos;s claims to be pursuing a purely peaceful energy generation scheme, seeing Tehran&apos;s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat and for that reason, a government adviser said recently, the standards of proof are lower.  &quot;While your intelligence has to be 90% sure before handing the decision to the policy-makers for action, our intelligence only has to be 70% sure,&quot; the advisor said.  He added that the Israeli public might forgive a botched mission, but would never forgive inaction in the face of such a perceived mortal threat. If the Iranian nuclear programme continues at the present pace, he said, a decision would have to be made in the next year to 18 months. The Iranian response has been to underline its deterrent with events like today&apos;s missile test and heightened rhetoric. Ali Shirazi, an aide to Iran&apos;s Supreme Leader, said Tel Aviv would &quot;burn&quot; if Iran was attacked. It would not be a limited war. Iranian officials have said that they would automatically presume an Israeli strike was western-backed and retaliate accordingly. Shirazi said the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would also be hit. In the past the Iranians have threatened asymmetric warfare using small boats and suicide bombers against much larger ships. It is a fair bet that shipping in the Straits of Hormuz \u2013 through which 40% of the world&apos;s oil passes - would either be blocked or seriously squeezed. Attacks on US and British troops could also be stepped up through proxies and allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. US military intervention would be unavoidable.

Standing eight metres high and just 13 metres from his building, it overshadows Sufian&apos;s second-floor apartment like the wall of a prison, darkening this once thriving Palestinian district. &quot;When I look from the window and see the wall, I immediately close the blinds and smoke a cigarette. It&apos;s like living at the end of the world,&quot; says Sufian, who asked to change his name to preserve his family&apos;s privacy. His neighbours fled long ago, as the West Bank barrier crept down the main street of al-Ram, dividing families, separating children from schools and patients from clinics, and severing the road back to Jerusalem. Stranded outside Jerusalem by the barrier, al-Ram has become a virtual ghost town. Palestinian customers who came to Al-Ram from Jerusalem&apos;s centre in search of cheaper prices have disappeared, as have one-third of its 1,800 businesses. Vast numbers of its 62,000 residents, unable to sell their homes, have gone. The abandoned shops, with their &quot;for sale&quot; signs, deserted streets and overgrown gardens are typical of the Palestinian towns cut off by the barrier on Jerusalem&apos;s eastern outskirts. Fearing permanent exile, many have moved back to Jerusalem. Israel conquered east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the Six Day war of 1967. Claiming to unify the city, which was divided at the 1948 birth of the Jewish state, Israel expanded Jerusalem&apos;s limits, tripling the territory inside the municipality. It roped in 28 Palestinian villages, stretching east from the ancient walls of the old city deep into the West Bank. Densely populated villages, such as al-Ram, were left outside the new boundaries. Those living within who would not swear allegiance to Israel in order to gain citizenship were issued blue identity cards granting them residency rights. Around 250,000 Palestinians now carry the card, and make up one-third of Jerusalem&apos;s population, But some 55,000 others - there are no precise figures - were left outside its boundaries. Over time, in search of jobs and cheaper housing, many moved beyond the municipality, sometimes to West Bank cities such as Ramallah but often to villages including al-Ram. Israel built the barrier to separate Israelis from Palestinians after 420 of its citizens died in terror attacks at the peak of the intifada, in 2002. But in Jerusalem, the spiritual heart of the 60-year territorial conflict, the barrier has had the opposite effect, forcing Israelis together with Palestinians scrambling back in search of a toehold inside the holy city. While east Jerusalemites resent Israel&apos;s occupation, they are reluctant to give up their rights. They qualify for Israeli welfare and can travel around Israel. &quot;We will do anything to move to keep our blue ID, not because of love but because it gives us an easier life,&quot; says Sufian. From his kitchen, Sufian, can see the last gap in the barrier, through which he travels each day to work near Tel Aviv. It already takes him hours to pass the local checkpoint, and he fears things are about to get much worse: Israel needs only to insert two more concrete blocks to seal the gap and shut al-Ram out for good. When that happens, he will be forced to travel several miles to a new checkpoint, where thousands will queue each day. He is on the verge of joining the exodus to the other side of the wall. &quot;If I could find a house, even in a Jewish neighborhood, I would take it,&quot; Sufian says.  Zahra Khalidi, from one of the oldest Palestinian families in Jerusalem, has already made the move. &quot;I can hardly keep my head above water,&quot; she says. Zahra moved to al-Ram in 1999, paying $60,000 (\u00a330,000) for a flat with a view over Jerusalem&apos;s municipality. As the barrier encroached down the street, cutting the value of her property to $35,000, she feared being exiled from the city where her family had lived for the past 900 years. So she moved back, renting a small apartment in the Muslim quarter of the old city because she could not afford to buy. For the past seven months Zahra has been unemployed and is struggling to make ends meet. Taxes and prices are higher, and rents have soared as tens of thousands of Palestinians have poured back, exacerbating the housing shortage. Jerusalem&apos;s municipality rarely grants Palestinians permission to build on their land and frequently demolishes structures built without permits, all the while defying the international community by approving new Jewish housing on the eastern side of the city.  Though Palestinians comprise one-third of the city&apos;s population, Jerusalem&apos;s municipality council consistently spends less than 10% of its budget in their neighborhoods.  Rubbish is strewn around the streets, roads are broken and unsealed, playgrounds and parks are scarce and ill maintained, and schools are run-down. &quot;It&apos;s very dirty in the old city,&quot; says Zahra. &quot;They totally neglect this side of the city.&quot;  But it is not just the Palestinians who have returned to Jerusalem&apos;s centre who are suffering. Ir Amim, an Israeli NGO dedicated to mitigating political tensions in Jerusalem, says all Jerusalem&apos;s Palestinians are under growing pressure. Associate director, Sarah Kreimer, says: &quot;The poverty makes people prey to the more extremist elements.&quot;  Jerusalem&apos;s Palestinians have resorted to political violence on many occasions before, dispatching suicide bombers to Jerusalem&apos;s commercial district. Just last week, a Palestinian who had lived near the city for generations went on a rampage with a tractor, crushing cars, wounding 30 people and killing three Israelis Ron Shatzberg, at the Economic Cooperation Foundation, a thinktank that advises Israel&apos;s government on security, worries that more east Jerusalemites will attack in the future.  &quot;When we close all of the entrances to Israel, terrorist organisations will put pressure on east Jerusalem Palestinians [to join them] because they are able to move around and they know Hebrew,&quot; he says. &quot;They will become the main target for recruiting.&quot; Most, however, are struggling to build the best lives they can amid turmoil and uncertainty. &quot;Whenever I see the wall, I can&apos;t control this ugly feeling inside me. It&apos;s hatred and anger,&quot; says Sufian.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-09T14:34:00Z", "title": "The great divide: Life in east Jerusalem", "sentences": ["From his kitchen, Sufian, can see the last gap in the barrier, through which he travels each day to work near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/09/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Canada", "World news", "Geneva conventions", "Americas"], "article": "Lawyers for a Palestinian village have begun a rare legal case against two Canadian construction companies working in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, accusing them of breaching war crimes laws and demanding an injunction to halt their work as well as damages worth around \u00a31m. Although there have been court cases in Israel against settlement construction, it is unusual for lawyers to take cases abroad against individual foreign construction firms, particularly under war crimes legislation. The case, brought to the Quebec superior court in Montreal, alleges that the two Canadian firms are breaching international law by building and selling homes in part of the settlement of Modi&apos;in Illit on land originally belonging to the Palestinian village of Bil&apos;in.  &quot;In so doing, the defendants are aiding, abetting, assisting and conspiring with the state of Israel in carrying out an illegal purpose,&quot; according to the writ of claim filed to the court. It said their conduct amounted to a &quot;fundamental violation of the human rights of the villagers&quot; and &quot;denies them freedom of movement&quot;. The village accuses the firms of breaching international law, including the fourth Geneva convention, as well as Canada&apos;s Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. All settlements in the occupied territories are illegal under international law, although Israel has for years defended its right to build there. The writ names the two firms as Green Park International and Green Mount International, both registered in Montreal. The lawyers said the case did not involve the similar sounding firm Greenpark International, which is based in Vaughan, Ontario, and which advertises itself as &quot;Canada&apos;s largest homebuilder&quot;. The two firms named in the writ are expected to strongly contest the case. In the past, lawyers representing them have argued that construction in the settlement is covered by approved planning schemes or does not substantially violate Israeli planning law. Renato Jarach, an Israeli lawyer based in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, and who represents the companies, declined to comment yesterday. Modi&apos;in Illit won a temporary injunction for more than a year stopping construction in one neighbourhood of the settlement, Matityahu East. However, construction has since restarted. Then last September Bil&apos;in won a rare victory when Israel&apos;s supreme court ordered the Israeli government to re-route the West Bank barrier away from Bil&apos;in, returning some of the land. The barrier has not yet been moved.

According to Iranian official reports, the military exercise involved nine missiles, one of them a new Shahab-3 long-range missile that could easily reach Israel and a number of US bases in the region. The Revolutionary Guard air force commander, Hossein Salami, said the test was not routine but a demonstration of resolve as pressure grows on Iran to curb its nuclear programme. &quot;We warn enemies who threaten us with military exercises and empty psychological operations that our hand will be on the trigger and our missiles will always be ready to launch,&quot; Salami said. He added that Iran had thousands of missiles ready to be launched against &quot;pre-determined targets&quot;. Days earlier, Ali Shirazi, an aide to Iran&apos;s Supreme Leader, said Iran would retaliate against Israel and the US if it was attacked. &quot;If they commit such a silly move, Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf will be Iran&apos;s first targets and they will be burned with Iran&apos;s crushing response,&quot; he said. The Shahab-3, which has an estimated range of more than 750 miles with a warhead weighing a tonne, has been tested before, but the remarks by Iranian officials made it clear that on this occasion the test was intended to send a message. Observers in the region interpreted the exercise as a pointed response to an Israeli exercise last month in which warplanes appeared to be rehearsing for a possible air strike against Iranian nuclear sites. An Israeli minister recently said that his government would have &quot;no choice&quot; but to attack Iranian sites if its nuclear programme continued. The UN security council has called on Iran to curb uranium enrichment and reprocessing on the grounds that they could be used to make a bomb. Iran insists its nuclear programme is intended to meet the country&apos;s future energy needs. A multinational team of diplomats visited Tehran last month to present economic and diplomatic incentives to suspend enrichment and reprocessing but Tehran has so far rejected any suspension.  The White House yesterday called on Iran to refrain from further tests. The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, cited them as evidence that the world needs the US missile defence system, which has met political resistance in Europe. Meanwhile, a senior state department official confirmed that US policy - to pursue a diplomatic solution but not to rule out a military option - remained unchanged. &quot;We view force as an option that is on the table but a last resort,&quot; William Burns, the state department&apos;s under secretary for political affairs, said yesterday.  Seven missile launches were detected by US tracking systems, and the Pentagon said it was studying the tests.  Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, said the tests demonstrated a need to change US policy to one of dialogue backed by tougher sanctions and fresh incentives. &quot;Now is the time to work with our friends and allies, and to pursue direct and aggressive diplomacy with the Iranian regime backed by tougher unilateral and multilateral sanctions,&quot; Obama said.  His Republican rival, John McCain, echoed Rice&apos;s line that the missiles underlined the need for a new missile defence system.  Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of operations and analysis at the CIA, said the missile tests &quot;showed the Iranians can cause a lot of problems if action is taken against them&quot;. He said he does not believe the US will attack Iran or that Israel would launch an attack on its own. &quot;An Israeli attack would not accomplish the goal of destroying its nuclear capability,&quot; he said. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;These tests are unwelcome and only serve to reinforce our concerns about Iranian intentions. We have to question: why does Iran need such long-range missiles? What we have seen just underlines the need for Iran to comply with its international obligations on the nuclear issue.&quot;    ", "publicationDate": "2008-07-09T23:01:00Z", "title": "Defiant Iran tests missiles to show strength in face of US warnings", "sentences": ["&quot;If they commit such a silly move, Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf will be Iran&apos;s first targets and they will be burned with Iran&apos;s crushing response,&quot; he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/iran.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "In the circles of Middle East peacemaking it is called &quot;coexistence&quot;, the often difficult and usually pioneering work that brings together Jews and Arabs, treats them as equals and tries to bridge their differences. Within Israel it still happens a lot, despite the terrible violence of the second intifada and the flagging political peace process. There are organisations that run bilingual Jewish-Arabic schools, including one in Jerusalem. There are joint business projects, musical ventures and even comedy shows. In Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, the small Yaffa cafe and bookshop became the first store in the mixed Jewish and Arab city to sell Arabic books since 1948. It brought a rare, mixed clientele to its wooden tables and won an award for promoting dialogue. Next month, Joe Cocker will perform at a high-profile &quot;coexistence festival&quot; featuring Jewish and Arab musicians in Gilboa, in northern Israel, which will also include a children&apos;s &quot;Bible-Koran quiz&quot;. These projects do much to challenge the broader exclusion and discrimination suffered by Arab citizens of Israel. But those involved say it is much easier to bring Jews and Arabs together within Israel than to bridge the larger gap between Israel and the Palestinian territories. In this small and bitterly contested slice of Middle Eastern soil that is home to around 10 million Jews and Arabs, genuine and equal coexistence between the two peoples is rare. Instead, separation is growing ever more entrenched. It begins with a physical divide, the steel and concrete barrier that runs along and deep into the West Bank, and the restrictions, checkpoints and closures of the 41-year military occupation. Then there is the dramatic reduction in the Palestinian workforce in Israel, rapidly being replaced by 200,000 foreign migrant labourers \u2013 Filipinos, Thais, Indians and others. With that comes an economic separation, a marked decrease in joint business initiatives or shared markets or even banking relationships. Then develops the cultural separation that means the only Israelis seen by most Palestinians are soldiers or settlers, and the only Palestinians seen by most Israelis are militants on the television news or the occasional worker on a building site. Abdul Latif Khalid is a highly qualified engineer and hydrology specialist who lives in the West Bank village of Jayyus, which is close to several Jewish settlements and which has lost much of its farmland to the barrier. &quot;You see settlers but as if there are two worlds,&quot; he said. &quot;You see a Palestinian community neighbouring a settlement but both are looking to each other as enemies not friends or neighbours. This is the problem with the wall as separation and this is why we say in the end the wall will create hatred.&quot; Perhaps inevitably, the concept of separation has crept into discussion of what a future peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians might look like. Often, Palestinians involved in joint initiatives face censure within their own community and are accused of acquiescing in the Israeli occupation, a process described with the derogatory word &quot;normalisation&quot;. It is particularly so now, when the idea of a two-state solution is being rejected by some Palestinians in favour of calls for a single, bi-national state in which all would have equal citizenship rights. Sometimes ventures simply collapse under the weight of criticism. In terms of protecting its own population from terrorist attacks, Israel argues in favour of the barrier and of the need for separation between the two sides. Many Israelis, particularly on the right wing, argue forcefully for a separation imposed on their own terms. &quot;The majority of Israel wants to be apart from the Palestinian state,&quot; Dov Weissglas, a Tel Aviv lawyer and long-time ally and adviser to the former prime minister Ariel Sharon, said in an interview with the Guardian late last year. &quot;We speak about non-belligerence, the kind of peace we have with Egypt, with Jordan. You can count on the fingers of one hand how many Egyptians came to Israel to enjoy that peace but nobody cares because not one single Israeli soldier was killed on the Egyptian front for the last 30 years, God bless them and us. That&apos;s what we need. The exchange of operas can be delayed.&quot; Palestinians, however, are quick to point out that just as this is not an equal conflict, so too the separation itself is also unequal. While Israel&apos;s economy is open to markets across the world, the Palestinians have become over the past 40 years completely dependent on the Israeli economy. Cut off from Israel, the Palestinian economy has little chance of recovery without access to markets abroad. &quot;There is one authority in control between the Mediterranean sea and the Jordan valley, and it is Israel,&quot; said Sam Bahour, a Palestinian-American business consultant who works on investment projects that give Palestinians a key role in determining how money is spent. Joint projects can work but are extremely hard to get off the ground and their success depends largely on the individuals involved, he said. He argues that separation between the two peoples is a well-advanced policy that was already visible both in the barrier and in other areas, including continued restrictions on Palestinians with foreign passports trying to enter or live in the Palestinian territories and Israel&apos;s ongoing, two-year delay in providing frequencies for a second Palestinian mobile telephone company. &quot;We see it in the wall because it is a physical structure but the policy to separate is the ground shift that Israel is now moving towards. It is a strategic change that I don&apos;t think everyone has observed,&quot; he said. &quot;They are taking every practical step on the ground to make sure the two communities can&apos;t really cooperate into a linked vision for the future. That is unfortunate.&quot; Some believe that a two-state solution to the conflict, both an Israel and an independent Palestine living alongside each other in security, is long out of reach. Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and a political scientist, argues that while there is a psychological and political separation between the two peoples, the idea of there one day being two geographically separate entities is anachronistic and has gone. &quot;The separation wall will just not hold. It is outdated already,&quot; he said. Instead, he said, Israel would continue its control over the West Bank, which it would turn into large Jewish settlement blocs with small and contained Palestinian towns scattered around. &quot;What you are going to see is the integration of two districts of the West Bank, north and south, into some kind of apartheid system of homelands. This is what you can see now,&quot; he said. &quot;Separation yes, but geographical separation no.&quot; Others argue that the inevitable result of years of conflict between the two sides means any resolution now would be two states separated from each other for many years. &quot;There is an absolute lack of trust. Even the limited trust at the time of Oslo is gone,&quot; said David Newman, a professor of political geography at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and editor of the journal Geopolitics. In the past, Israel would have wanted a border that was open for economic interests, but now it would want a border that was completely sealed and would rely instead on migrant labour and access to overseas markets. The Palestinians, on the other hand, were in the dilemma of wanting employment in Israel, but not under some form of neo-colonial relationship in which the Israeli economy continues to dominate. &quot;I think it is much harder to implement a two-state solution today than five or 10 years ago. And every day you have more settlements and facts on the ground it becomes increasingly difficult,&quot; said Newman. &quot;But you have to realise the alternative is not what some people would like to see as a one-state, bi-national secular democracy. The alternative is the continuation of the occupation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-07-09T23:08:37Z", "title": "Living alongside the enemy", "sentences": ["In Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, the small Yaffa cafe and bookshop became the first store in the mixed Jewish and Arab city to sell Arabic books since 1948.", "&quot;The majority of Israel wants to be apart from the Palestinian state,&quot; Dov Weissglas, a Tel Aviv lawyer and long-time ally and adviser to the former prime minister Ariel Sharon, said in an interview with the Guardian late last year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Art", "Israel", "Religion", "US news", "Art and design", "Censorship"], "article": "Chicago&apos;s Jewish leaders are testy about criticism of Israel. Jewish directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs apparently pressured its director to cancel a talk by Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer last year. Now some of the same figures may have deemed an art exhibit at the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies too hot to handle. As a result, the exhibit, Imaginary Coordinates, which featured works investigating Israeli and Palestinian concepts of homeland, has been shut down two and a half months early because of complaints that it was anti-Israel.  What precisely was so threatening? In one video installation, an Israeli artist appeared nude on a Tel Aviv beach spinning a barbed-wire hula-hoop as it lacerated her skin, symbolising fortified barriers which cause pain to those they encircle. In another video, an Israeli woman drove through Jerusalem asking for directions to Ramallah. Each person provides different directions and describes Ramallah as far away, when it is actually quite close, illustrating how psychic distance affects the maps in our minds. Ahmad Ibrahim&apos;s Memory Map of Jimzu shows every home destroyed in his Palestinian village in 1948. Another work was a menorah whose candleholders are IDF shell casings. Challenging? Yes. Provocative? To be sure. But hostile to Israel? How could anyone presume that a Jewish museum would allow itself to demean Israel? Unfortunately, there is no telling what will provoke the sensitivities of those in the Jewish leadership. The artists dared to question a few shibboleths, and local philistines felt their hearts twitter in response. Like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, they commanded: &quot;Off with her head.&quot; And just like that, Imaginary Coordinates has become a figment of our imagination. This decision reminds me other art museums that have censored or cancelled controversial exhibits. The Smithsonian Air and Space Museum bowdlerised an exhibit about the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan. The Corcoran Gallery cancelled an exhibit of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Rudy Giuliani tried to force the Brooklyn Museum to cancel its exhibit, Sensation, which he deemed offensive to Catholics. Often the institutions came out looking badly in the wider community for compromising their artistic integrity. Steven Nasatir, president of the Chicago Jewish Federation, told the Chicago Tribune that he felt that the Spertus show was &quot;clearly anti-Israel&quot;, though he refused to specify what he found objectionable. About the closing, he said: &quot;It&apos;s an institution saying, &apos;We made a mistake, we&apos;re sorry and let&apos;s move on.&apos;&quot; Nasatir&apos;s &quot;let&apos;s move on&quot; reminds me of the policeman at the scene of a car wreck urging bystanders to move on. It&apos;s the call of bureaucrats everywhere who prefer the public not question them. What should be the nature of a Jewish museum? Should it be a booster to Jewish identity, or should its primary commitment be to artistic integrity?  In an essay for the exhibition catalogue, Spertus director Rhoda Rosen articulated a bold vision for the institution&apos;s new $55m building in the heart of downtown Chicago. In hindsight, it is sad and ironic. Spertus, she wrote, is moving &quot;from the parochial toward the civic&quot;:  While the new Spertus&apos; starting point continues to be Jewish experience, the institution does not operate from a partisan point of view. ... At times broadly accepted Jewish assumptions will be examined and cherished, and at others they will be examined and questioned.  How disappointing that such a bracing vision has been stymied. If it must pull its punches over an exhibit most viewers and artists found well within the consensus of political and artistic discourse, hasn&apos;t Spertus lost the right to call itself an art museum? Isn&apos;t it more like a glorified gift shop displaying mezuzas, prayer books, tallises and other ritual paraphernalia? Such a museum isn&apos;t so much interested in art as in expressing a consensus Jewish view about creative expression and identity. Art that has to toe the line isn&apos;t art - at least not art in the traditional, freewheeling sense of the term. Spertus president Howard Sulkin provides a perfect example of the schizophrenic nature of this issue. &quot;A willingness to experiment is incorporated right into our core principles, and we see one of our roles as being a place that inspires dialogue on the critical issues of our time,&quot; he told the Chicago Tribune. But Spertus betrayed that very mission by cancelling Imaginary Coordinates. Marc Wilcow, another museum trustee, further amplified the problematic nature of the conflict: &quot;When there is a perception that the state of Israel is not being depicted in a balanced way it creates controversy,&quot; he told the Tribune. &quot;Spertus is not interested in going around and hurting people&apos;s feelings.&quot; So Spertus wants to make people think. But not too hard. And if it does make them think too hard it will recoil from such a commitment. When push comes to shove, Spertus is constrained by the parochialism of the local Jewish community. It has to toe the line and abandon its artistic principles in order to maintain ties to its core, and conservative, constituency. Do these people think their audience consists of children who cannot reason for themselves? Does the Israeli-Palestinian conflict need to be chewed and pre-digested like the worms a bird feeds her young? Is Israel such a fragile reed that even Israeli artists should not be allowed to question it? What an impoverished Jewish worldview. This is nothing less than the closing of the American-Jewish mind. We can think for ourselves, thank you. We don&apos;t need to be protected from so-called dangerous art. Rutgers sociology professor Chaim Waxman has noted the declining affiliation of Jewish youth with the organised community. He attributes the decline largely to the close-mindedness of the Jewish leadership. Young Jews look at such closed-mindedness and say: &quot;What do I need this for? I can become involved in the non-Jewish world and express myself more fully without having to censor myself.&quot; Young Jews aren&apos;t interested in their father&apos;s Oldsmobile. They are interested in the world at large, which includes Judaism, Israel and other Jewish issues. But they no longer have to approach them from within the community, especially if that community is hostile to free inquiry and expression. So when you hear Jewish leaders bemoan the loss of commitment by young Jews to the organised Jewish community, tell them they brought it on themselves. Steve Nasatir thinks he can force these decisions down the community&apos;s throat without paying a price. Well, there is a price. It is the withering away of the next Jewish generation.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-10T13:00:00Z", "title": "Richard Silverstein: Art that is critical of Israel should nonetheless be exhibited", "sentences": ["In one video installation, an Israeli artist appeared nude on a Tel Aviv beach spinning a barbed-wire hula-hoop as it lacerated her skin, symbolising fortified barriers which cause pain to those they encircle."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/art.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Animal welfare", "World news", "Animals"], "article": "Specially designed fluorescent vests for camels could be used to help prevent traffic accidents in Israel.

Any fallout could have devastating consequences. Iranian retaliation against oilfields, refineries and desalination plants in the Gulf, especially in eastern Saudi Arabia, is an obvious worry. Tehran has gone on the record as threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz, the choke point for 40% of globally-traded oil, if it is attacked. Washington quickly insisted that it will not let that happen. As the sabres rattled this week, Iran warned that it would strike at Tel Aviv and the US navy, though Revolutionary Guard Shehab missiles would find it difficult to distinguish between American and Arab targets: the US Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain; US Central Command in nearby Qatar and the US navy has long relied on docking facilities at Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. Even without the threat of war, Iran&apos;s Arab neighbours have long lived in fear of another Chernobyl: the Bushehr nuclear reactor, two miles from the Gulf coast, is closer to six Arab capitals (Kuwait, Riyadh, Manama, Doha, Abu Dhabi and Muscat) than it is to Tehran. Any nuclear accident would be an ecological disaster. But the recent sniping has been ominous. &quot;We are sandwiched between Iran on the one hand and Israel and the US on the other,&quot; said Mustafa Alani of the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai. &quot;We feel that we are going to be victims.&quot; Abdullah Alshayji, a Kuwaiti analyst, agrees, describing the Gulf states as &quot;feeling like helpless bystanders with little room to manoeuvre&quot;. War would be &quot;a nightmare of epic proportions for the whole region,&quot; he said. And Tehran is mistrusted in almost every Arab capital. None believe the insistent claim that it is interested only in civilian nuclear power and has no military ambitions. It is seen as working to establish its hegemony across the Middle East, setting the agenda through allies or &quot;non-state&quot; proxies such as Hizbullah and Hamas, confounding the US and Israel in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine. Syria, Iran&apos;s only Arab ally, is the glaring exception, maintaining a strategic relationship that dates back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Maverick Qatar, home to al-Jazeera as well as a huge US air base, has been careful to stay on good terms with Tehran, not least because of massive joint natural gas projects. Otherwise Arab states are united in their suspicion of the country they fervently hoped to see defeated by Saddam Hussein in his eight-year struggle against Ayatollah Khomeini. Historic Arab antipathy to Persians still runs very deep. And vice versa. The sight of long-range Iranian missiles being launched into desert skies was a grim reminder of that war against Saddam. But Arabs already see Iran as the main beneficiary of the more recent conflict in Iraq, with the Sunnis defeated and marginalised by the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad \u2014 even if there are now signs of grudging acceptance that it is there to stay. Public statements by Arab leaders make clear that they oppose military action by Israel or the United States. The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council has declared that it would not allow its territory to be used to attack Iran \u2014 and even hosted Iran&apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at its summit late last year. Saudi Arabia, where some military men are said to be privately advocating a hardline stance towards Iran, has chosen the path of accommodation rather than confrontation. King Abdullah made a symbolic public declaration of this policy last year when he invited Ahmadinejad to go on the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.  Bahrain, just a few miles across the Gulf from Iran, has anxieties over so-called Iranian &quot;sleeper cells&quot; amongst its restive Shias - the majority of the population in the Sunni-ruled kingdom. But it too favours engagement and diplomacy \u2014 and worries about conflict. The same is true of Kuwait, at the head of the Gulf. Further afield, Jordan&apos;s King Abdullah, who coined the phrase &quot;Shia crescent&quot; to describe the alarming spread of Sunni-Shia sectarianism, warned recently that action against Iran would open a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot;. His recommendation: &quot;Engage with the Iranians. A military strike in Iran will only solicit a reaction from Iran and Iranian proxies, and I don&apos;t think that we can live with any more conflicts in this part of the world.&quot; Privately, things may be different: &quot;If we have to choose between Iranian nuclear deterrence and intimidation, or accept military action as a solution, we&apos;ll accept military action,&quot; says Alani. &quot;We in the Gulf can live with Iranian retaliation for a week or a month. That&apos;s manageable compared to the possibility that Iran will be a nuclear power.&quot; Israel, waging an intensifying propaganda campaign over Iran - and seeking to coax Syria away from its alliance with Tehran - likes to claim that &quot;moderate&quot; Arab states would support an attack on Iran&apos;s nuclear installations, though passive acquiescence is not the same as active support.  &quot;We would not be participants,&quot; Alani says of the Gulf states. &quot;We would be beneficiaries. But no one will say this in public. We don&apos;t want premature confrontation because we still believe there is a margin for a diplomatic solution.&quot; Still, there is no mistaking the anxiety in the region. &quot;Perhaps the objective of Iran&apos;s frequent threats is to stir up fear amongst the Gulf states over the repercussions of any US strike against it so that they it turn may pressure Washington into preventing any military action,&quot; observed Abdul Rahman Al-Rashed in the Saudi-owned al-Sharq al-Awsat. &quot;But this is having an opposite effect from the desired one.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-07-10T16:18:30Z", "title": "Middle East analysis: Arabs fear fallout of nuclear conflict", "sentences": ["As the sabres rattled this week, Iran warned that it would strike at Tel Aviv and the US navy, though Revolutionary Guard Shehab missiles would find it difficult to distinguish between American and Arab targets: the US Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain; US Central Command in nearby Qatar and the US navy has long relied on docking facilities at Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/middleeast.iran"}, {"tags": ["Culture", "Books", "William Shakespeare"], "article": "Gadfly in Russia  Alan Sillitoe  JR Books \u00a38.99 With 1,300 roubles in his pocket, advanced by two Russian magazine publishers for extracts of his successful early books, Alan Sillitoe set off in 1967 to drive 5,000 miles around Russia in his blue Peugeot estate.

Nicholl&apos;s launchpad is a single document bearing one of only six surviving signatures belonging to Shakespeare: his deposition in a legal case over a dowry unpaid by his landlord, Christopher Mountjoy. It transpires that Shakespeare, having no daughter of his own, was instrumental in securing the &apos;troth-plight&apos; of the couple in question. Shakespeare himself remains as elusive as ever, but Nicholl brings Jacobean London brimmingly to life and teases out intriguing parallels between the sometimes grubby circumstances of Shakespeare&apos;s domestic arrangements and the plays he wrote in Silver Street.

Six years on, having had a daughter with Hughes, Wevill took her own life and that of her child, in almost identical fashion to Plath. To lose one lover may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose both, you could argue, looks like carelessness.

And as the tangerine light deepens across the silver-green leaves of the surrounding olive groves, Montasser Jabriny, aged 16, plays the first sensual but mournful notes of &apos;al-Haluadi&apos; (&apos;The Beautiful Girl&apos;) on his clarinet. Resha Shalelda, of the same age, follows on her flute, and the evening&apos;s music is under way. This is the heart of the occupied Palestinian territories, where olive trees tumble down the slopes, machine-gun posts guarding Israeli settlements atop them. The children playing are from Ramallah, the capital of the Palestinian West Bank, and Jenin, scene of an infamous atrocity by the Israeli armed forces. The music is oriental, with its lilting chromatics and heady melodies, and this concert is part of a festival commemorating the 60th anniversary of what Palestinians call &apos;al-Nakba&apos;, the Catastrophe; a few kilometres away, Israelis are concurrently celebrating the founding of their country out of the ashes of the Holocaust. There is a connection between this scene and the apex of music, to a unique figure at that apex and a unique project that embodies not the duality between the anniversaries, but the opposite - not the six decades of hatred, misunder standing, violence and subjugation, but a model for encounter, mutual acceptance and ultimately peace - through music. That figure is Daniel Barenboim, the finest pianist of his generation and one of its greatest conductors, but also a visionary and activist in the cause of music, of music in defiance of war; the cause of art over hatred. He is also the first and only Israeli to take dual citizenship, holder too of a Palestinian passport. The project is an orchestra Barenboim founded with the late, great Palestinian writer Edward Said, which he conducts and brings to the Proms this August: the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, made up of young Israeli Jewish, Palestinian and other Arab musicians. Barenboim and Said took the name from a series of late poems by Goethe during his study of Arabic and Persian verse, Divan meaning &apos;the other&apos;. The musicians from Israel and Palestine (also Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere), first gathered for sessions in 1999 at Weimar, city of Bach, Goethe and Schiller - zenith of German culture - from where they also\ufeff made a pilgrimage to the nadir of German and human history, the nearby death camp at Buchenwald. The connection between the Divan and the beautiful, defiant scene in the Sebastia amphitheatre, built during the time of King Herod, is the man at the mixing desk, who turns towards his assistant, flashes a smile and gives a thumb&apos;s up, Ramzi Aburedwan. The young musicians are pupils of a project he runs across the West Bank, and this concert is the climax to much hard work. &apos;For me, to see them play well is an even greater pleasure than to play myself,&apos; he says. Ramzi, 29, plays the viola in the Divan, and his arrival in the orchestra was propelled by a life shaped by those 60 years since 1948. The state of Israel was founded in 1948 as &apos;a land without a people for a people without a land&apos;, as some Zionists at the time put it. But Palestine, which had been under a British colonial mandate, was not devoid of people. The torching of Palestinian villages, the driving out of their population and subjugation of those who remained - to give the Jews the homeland they craved in the wake of calamity in Europe - has been the backdrop to the region&apos;s life ever since. Israel&apos;s eastern border was called the &apos;Green Line&apos;, with Palestinians granted old Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza under Jordanian tutelage. But in the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the Holy City, the West Bank and Gaza, creating further waves of refugees, and began building heavily guarded settlements in order to annexe the territories demographically as well as militarily and economically. We are now in the throes of the often bloody second Palestinian &apos;intifada&apos; (Uprising) against occupation, and its ruthless suppression, which have so far claimed the lives of some 4,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis. The last time I went from Arab East Jerusalem to Ramzi&apos;s home town of Ramallah, 25 years ago, it was a simple 15-minute breeze by car, albeit across Israeli-occupied territory. Not any more. It involves crossing the &apos;security barrier&apos; - the wall, violent in itself - which cuts not along the 1948 &apos;Green Line&apos;, but through the West Bank like a scar, so that on the way, we find people living one side of the checkpoints, their workshops, fields and families on the other. As we finally get to the Ramallah side, there is some famous graffiti by Banksy, and other bitter wit: &apos;CTRL+ALT+DELETE&apos;, some wag has painted. &apos;This Wall Will Fall&apos;, hopes another, in the spirit, indeed, of the Divan orchestra. It was here, in 1979, that Ramzi was born in the concrete-and-corrugated-iron al-Amari refugee camp. &apos;I didn&apos;t understand what the occupation was,&apos; he says, until &apos;my grandfather explained that he had another house in a village from which he had been expelled in 1948, with beautiful trees around it. There was only one tree in the camp.&apos; Ramzi sold newspapers for his grandfather, taking home crumbs of change, and his life was illuminated by a nine-year-old girl, Nahil, a year his superior when the first intifada erupted in 1987. &apos;She was so beautiful and every morning I would wait for her in front of her house. I was so strongly in love with her. One day, she was carrying bread from the bakery, but there was an Israeli sniper, in a big building in front of the camp. Nahil was crossing the road when he shot her in the head. I ran to try and save her, but he was still shooting. I have the picture of that moment in my head all the time, and I still have her photograph. She died in hospital, and I couldn&apos;t understand who it was could kill a little girl. I grew up suddenly, asking the question: how are you able to do this?&apos; Ramzi became the stone-throwing poster-boy of the refugee camp, literally: a picture of him appeared in a magazine, rock in each hand, wearing an extraordinary expression between rage and fear. &apos;We used to go to a valley to play, to hear the echo of our voices. But then they built a settlement and a road for the settlers, so it was forbidden. But we threw stones at the settlers&apos; cars in the morning before school, on the way back from school, and when they started using plastic windows, we found new methods to throw bigger stones and break plastic ones. I was shot three times, once while they had taken me and were beating me up&apos; - and Ramzi shows a scar on his upper arm, that which now holds the neck of a viola. &apos;Then came the change in my life. I got too old to be selling newspapers and did other jobs, cleaning, gardening. There was a music workshop, with instruments for 20 people. They gave me a viola. It made such a beautiful sound, I was happy, and that day, my life changed 360 degrees. Well, not quite. The workshop was on a road with a yellow line on it, which we could not cross. And I put my viola down for 20 minutes to throw stones and break some windows. My teacher was shocked. He wanted me to understand that I can make the revolution with my instrument, not with stones, and only later did I come to see that music can make the revolution.&apos; That was after the arrival of a viola player from Massachusetts, Peter Sulski, to play a chamber concert, Mozart&apos;s G Minor Piano quintet, recalls Ramzi. &apos;I was amazed - it was not like our music, all the parts were different, I didn&apos;t know which to follow.&apos; Sulski felt Ramzi&apos;s talent and insight, and offered him a lesson. &apos;I didn&apos;t want him to leave the room,&apos; says Ramzi. This led to a summer school at Apple Hill in New Hampshire: &apos;Americans, French, musicians from all over the world, and I realised something. We were all reading different parts of the same thing. It was partly the beauty of the music, but it was the idea of sound, of the instruments playing together that won me.&apos; Ramzi is a detached but passionate man, wounded but strong. And he says suddenly: &apos;I cannot concentrate on this any more, we must carry on another time.&apos; He retreats to play his bouzuk, beautiful but lachrymose, alone in a room, thereby saying more, in a way, than any words. But there is thus a chance to talk to Sulski, a droll Bostonian who calls the project in New Hampshire &apos;a bit like the rest of them - well-meaning, glossing over the issues and pretending that this is an encounter between equals when really it&apos;s between a guy with a gun and a kid in the gutter&apos;. But for all his scepticism, Sulski enthuses: &apos;There are so many other Ramzis, and we need to find them and teach them.&apos; The fact that the music is classical and from Europe is irrelevant, he says. &apos;Beautiful music is beautiful music, and captivates those who see its beauty. I can play salsa well, and people will say: &quot;It&apos;s not in your blood&quot;. So what? We are teaching and playing good music, not the theme to Star Wars , and the kids understand that perfectly well. They can tell the difference between Mozart and Star Wars .&apos; After Apple Hill, Ramzi won a place to study at the conservatoire in Angers, France, for seven years during which three things happened. One was an invitation to join the Divan orchestra at its first assembly in Weimar, but his teacher, Francois Hetch, counselled: &apos;They have asked you not because you are a musician but because you are a Palestinian. You must know your musical limits, you are not ready.&apos; The second was the detonation of the second intifada in 2000. Ramallah was its original centre, and when another invitation came to join the Divan, Ramzi &apos;was too worried about my grandparents and family, needing to visit from France every summer and winter - I couldn&apos;t do any summer project. I was afraid, I could not concentrate, I was not playing well.&apos; But the third, crucial event was Ramzi&apos;s desire to impart to the children of the camp what he had learned about the communion and power of music. &apos;The children were enthusiastic, pushing me to teach them, inviting me into their homes, bringing my bouzuk and viola, to hear both the oriental and classical sound during the curfew. People called me a dreamer, they didn&apos;t realise music could help, they only saw that later. They said, &quot;Why are you doing this? You have to fight, you have to eat.&quot; But I replied: &quot;What they are doing here is killing the lives of the people. Bring music, and you bring life. No one can live without music, only they don&apos;t know that.&quot; And the children who played were suddenly interested in the future.&apos; And so the Al-Kamandjati (the violinist) music school was born, parallel to the music foundation Barenboim and Said had established in Ramallah, not only to encourage excellence but to bring as many children as possible to music. Ramzi found a lovely building in old Ramallah which was renovated by the Swedish government, and now resounds with music made by children who scuttle across the courtyard to be taught by musicians from Italy, Germany, America, Britain and elsewhere. Mischievous little Ale, aged 10, spends all day there, offering plums from a plate while a Bach cello suite flows through a window and into the morning sun, until her violin lesson. &apos;I was doing nothing on the street as usual,&apos; says Montasser, the 16-year-old clarinettist in the amphitheatre, &apos;and Ramzi said: &quot;Why don&apos;t you play?&quot; So I came to al-Kamandjati and tried the double bass but my fingers were too soft, and I suddenly heard the clarinet. It was the most beautiful sound I have ever heard, and I asked if I could learn how to make it, and Ramzi said &quot;Yes&quot;. And if it wasn&apos;t for this, I&apos;d be in the streets, watching TV, wasting time and maybe getting into trouble. Instead, music fills my life. Best of all, I like to play Mozart&apos;s 40th Symphony.&apos; &apos;I&apos;d be stuck at home washing dishes!&apos; laughs Resha, who followed Montasser on the flute, tossing her long hair as if to shake off the very idea. &apos;But instead, music is the air I breathe, and I couldn&apos;t live without it. Why? Because it makes me feel like I am flying, and proud of who I am and where I come from.&apos; Among the first people Ramzi met when he finally joined the Divan in 2006 was the Jewish leader of his viola section, Amichai Grosz, born in 1979 in the mountain village of Bar Giora, south of Jerusalem, and now the violist in the internationally celebrated Jerusalem String Quartet. Amichai, a serious and committed but entirely gracious young man, had also said an initial no to Barenboim. &apos;It was my first vacation with my girlfriend, and we were driving south from Madrid,&apos; he recalls. The Divan orchestra has its summer camp near Seville, as guest of the Andalusian regional government. &apos;And a friend said, &quot;Go and say hi to Barenboim - he&apos;s there with the orchestra.&quot; I thought: &quot;Who wouldn&apos;t want to say hi to Daniel Barenboim?&quot;&apos; But when the couple arrived, Barenboim said: &apos;Would you come and play?&apos; &apos;I thought, &quot;Oh shit, I shouldn&apos;t have done this, we&apos;re on vacation&quot; - and eventually he let me go.&apos; This was autumn 2000, after which Barenboim joined Amichai&apos;s quartet for a perform ance of Dvorak&apos;s piano quintet in Jerusalem. &apos;Pretty scary,&apos; recalls Amichai. But we played, and afterwards he told me: &quot;You have to join the Divan.&quot; You don&apos;t say no to Barenboim again.&apos; The journey from Ramallah to Amichai&apos;s collection of hamlets is one of some 20 kilometres, but from one world into another, and out to yet another again. Back towards the wall, and through it on a &apos;settler road&apos;, there is the vast sprawl of Jewish settlements. One navigates into Jerusalem itself, and the brazen ugliness of scrappy edifices like the &apos;Olive Grove Hotel&apos; (for which a lovely grove no doubt made way), past the wondrous old city, holy to all three confessions, to the Jerusalem Music Centre in a pleasant park - where Amichai has been performing to children - and then out past the sprawl again, to a verdant valley. Like Ramzi, Amichai is from a family steeped in the violent history of the 20th century - the Holocaust by which Israel defines itself - such is the cruel twist to Israel&apos;s existence and the occupation. Amichai&apos;s father Yehuda, a boisterous baker of good bread, tells how Amichai&apos;s paternal grandfather was a wealthy forestry merchant in Romania who was herded onto a locomotive cattle truck bound north in 1944, to become another victim of history&apos;s greatest crime. With a friend, though, he jumped the train and made a way to France, where, through business contacts, he was able to find the French Maquis resistance. Married to an artist of Hungarian/Czech descent (most of whose extended family, like Yehuda&apos;s, perished), Amichai first heard a recording of Isaac Stern playing the violin when he was four. But this enthralment to music was interrupted, aged five, when &apos;my parents decided to take a break from working life and took me for one and a half years on a trip round the world&apos;, including a Thai beach on which &apos;my job was to steal coconuts piled up by a restaurant, because I was little&apos;. When the family returned - &apos;I had rings on my fingers, a chain around my neck, and people looked at me as a UFO&apos; - Amichai returned to the violin, only for an epiphany, aged 12, when &apos;I heard a viola for the first time, and immediately knew I wanted to switch - it was darker, deeper, more like the human voice&apos;. Amichai studied at the Jerusalem Music Academy, set up the quartet and was then made the offer he could not refuse. At first, &apos;it was a mixed feeling for me. There is Gaza, the rockets coming out of Gaza, and it shouldn&apos;t be like that. But then the way we treat the Arabs is not a solution. Everything you do will come back to you somehow. The way it is developing is not a solution. But to play with Arabs - it was just natural. Music has no nation. &apos;Barenboim is always saying his project is not political. But one of the really great things is that this is a political statement by both sides. It is more important not for people like myself, but for people to see that it is possible to sit down with Arab people and play. The orchestra is a human laboratory that can express to the whole world how to cope with the other.&apos; Amichai says the Divan is like a family, although on occasions, such as after the Tel Aviv bus bombing in 2002, relationships are not easy. &apos;It was tense, but at the end of the day there was a concert - we had to share the music together, and that is what we did ... everyone brings their dirty laundry; the idea is to learn from the other side.&apos; This convergence of differences, and the subversiveness of Barenboim&apos;s project, reached a zenith when the Divan orchestra played in Ramallah during summer 2004. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen not on military duty to enter an area of the West Bank other than a settlement, and the Israeli musicians were taken the 15km from Jerusalem and through the wall in a fleet of armoured cars and carrying diplomatic papers issued by the Spanish government. &apos;And there we were,&apos; recalls Amichai, &apos;making music in the new concert hall in Ramallah for an Arab audience. I was proud of myself just being part of it, and just to see the giant Barenboim so moved himself. For an Israeli, it was like breaking the rules of this horrible status quo that we live.&apos; Barenboim is known for heresies other than bringing together Israeli and Palestinian musicians; he brought to Israel the revolutionary and remarkable - but to Jewry, tainted and offensive - music of Richard Wagner, generally famous here for being admired by the Nazis. And by scheduling Wagner with the Divan orchestra - the Prelude and &apos;Love-Death&apos; from Tristan und Isolde - Barenboim threw something of a gauntlet to his fellow Israelis. There was a vote, and the orchestra elected to play Wagner. &apos;Playing Wagner is important for any musician,&apos; says Amichai, &apos;and I have played Wagner with Barenboim, but only when I am not in Israel. In Israel, we still have people for whom it is a debate, so that I cannot take either side. On the other hand, if a musician wants to play modern music - Mahler or Schoenberg - you need to play Wagner.&apos; Time comes to leave, to pack away Amichai&apos;s wonderful instrument made in 1570, in Brescia, by Gaspar da Salo, and take with us his greetings to our next appointment in Nazareth, part of Amichai&apos;s country, but a Palestinian town with a large population of Palestinian Christians. Highway 6 - the\ufeff Yitzak Rabin highway, named after the Israeli Prime Minister and peacemaker assassinated by an Israeli fanatic - is itself a military installation walled off from much of the view and skirting the wall at times, as the occupied West Bank reaches its westernmost point at Qalqilya. Here, the Green Line has divided neighbour from neighbour for 60 years, so that if a Palestinian from Qalqilya meets and fall in love with a Palestinian from the adjacent town of Tuba, they are forbidden to marry. And this turns out to be the surprising theme underpinning the roots of what one of the lead violinists of the Divan is doing in Nazareth - uniting not Israeli with Palestinian, but Palestinians divided from one another. &apos;I can play with musicians from Tel Aviv any time,&apos; says Palestinian Nabeel Abboud Ashkar, 29. &apos;I studied with them. What I could not do was play with my own people on the other side of the wall.&apos; In the Barenboim-Said Foundation School, Nabeel leads a group of children playing Corelli&apos;s Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No.8. His tone is sumptuous, but that of the little boys to his left, Yamen Saadi, 11, and Feras Machour, 12, is excellent too, even though Nabeel has been teaching them for only four years. Both Yamen and Feras admit that they want to be Nabeel when they grow up. &apos;When I went to see the Divan orchestra,&apos; says Feras, &apos;I started thinking that I could play for it one day, it made me always think forward.&apos; &apos;And it is good for people to see us do this,&apos; adds Yamen, &apos;because we are Palestinians, and the outside world thinks that everything here is war. My close friends respect that I have my life, but many people my age say: &quot;Why are you doing this? This kind of music is none of your business.&quot;&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; adds Feras, &apos;they ask: &quot;Why are you playing the violin all day instead of playing football? You&apos;re taking all the fun out of your life.&quot; But I know what I want to do with mine, to play music.&apos; But only when he was 25, after he had joined the Divan, did Nabeel himself realise that music was his professional calling - he had played the violin in parallel with studies in physics and engineering at Tel Aviv University. &apos;I was not sure about giving up science - then along came the Divan orchestra.&apos; Nabeel&apos;s family were friends with Edward Said, the co-founder of the Divan, and &apos;they needed a violinist. I joined, and the whole idea of how music could influence the lives of people became clear to me. The Divan opened my eyes to the extent music could play a role in educating our young generation.&apos; Meanwhile, Nabeel had met some musicians in Ramallah, and &apos;I realised that classical music education was needed in Palestinian society.&apos; With the children he teaches, Nabeel alternates between his benign elder-brother-teacher figure and the ruthlessness required to conduct even a children&apos;s orchestra with, he says, &apos;no compromise&apos;. In conversation, he is gracious but intense, and before coming to the school, Nabeel had begun over lunch by making a point about music that cuts to the core of what Barenboim is doing with his orchestra - and what Nabeel is doing with these children. Barenboim&apos;s performance of all 32 Beethoven piano sonatas over eight nights in London earlier this year was hailed as one of the mightiest musical occasions in living memory - in large part because Barenboim emphasised the passion and glow within the music. This is the context in which Nabeel places what he does here, and with the Divan. &apos;I think the playing of instruments has become a technical science,&apos; he says. &apos;One has only to look at books on how to learn the violin, and compare them to those of the late 19th century. Similarly, I think audiences do not listen to music in the way they used to. We are trying to do something more than technical science.&apos; It is true that when one hears the Divan (or, the Simon Bolivar orchestra of young people from the slums of Venezuela), one is moved not only by the extraordinary quality of the playing, or by sentiment - there is an extra power of passion and motive, of music meaning something. And that has its roots in what Nabeel is doing here, too. &apos;Here in Nazareth, music is playing a role not just in educating young people, but making them understand their identity. And that means a lot for a Palestinian living in Israel, where part of our personality is missing. Jewish people in Israel have a problem with me saying I&apos;m a Palestinian - the official term is &apos;Israeli Arab&apos;, but that is wrong - &apos;Arab&apos; is a culture not a nationality; I was born into a Palestinian family which was here before the state of Israel. They don&apos;t want to face the fact that we were torn apart in 1948.&apos; It was travelling as a musician that enhanced Nabeel&apos;s view of who he was. &apos;I realised when I went to study in Germany: as long as you are living as a Palestinian in Israel, you are constantly aware of who you are in relation to the place you are living. You are a second-class citizen and people don&apos;t want you there. In Germany, I felt comfortable being a Palestinian, proud of it.&apos; But, he says, &apos;we are isolated from the Arab world and the rest of the Palestinian people. For 60 years, we have been living in cultural isolation. Music has started to play a role in breaking that isolation. For those who have talent, it has opened doors to the rest of the world.&apos; Nabeel was at the hub of a group of friends in Nazareth &apos;who appreciate classical music&apos; and who supported his conviction that &apos;music could change the lives of our children. The time was ripe; we had so many families wanting and willing their children to learn and play classical music. The project had to involve European classical music, says Nabeel, &apos;because in Arabic culture music is considered a hobby, it is a vocal music culture, and a folk music culture. The discipline of classical music is a cultural and intellectual challenge, it is very demanding, and the children either find it too rigid, or they find it fascinating.&apos; The school was born, and the connections to Ramallah forged. The Barenboim-Said foundation wanted &apos;a Palestinian orchestra in Ramallah&apos; and &apos;because of the efforts we had made here, there already were young people playing classical instruments in Nazareth&apos;. All that was left was to break through the wall, go to Ramallah and play, which, for all the difficulties, they did. &apos;Nazareth is a different place to Ramallah. Maybe it would work, maybe not - and it was very pleasing to see that after half an hour, there was one homogenous group.&apos; With these children, says Nabeel, &apos;I never talk about politics, but only of being proud of what you are because of what you are capable of. And so it changes how they consider themselves, as individuals and as a minority people. We produce great doctors and lawyers, but the arts were always a shortfall, and the Israeli government has never made any effort to change that. Now that is changing, and this change is making the young generation more complete with themselves as individuals and as a people.&apos; &apos;Sometimes,&apos; says Nabeel, &apos;I am an observer at the Divan. I can understand the Israelis more than the other Arabs - perhaps I am more aware of Jewish insecurity than the other Arabs. And I can certainly understand the Arab side better than the Israelis.&apos; Critics often write that the story behind the Divan is all sweetness and light. But it is not; it is edgier, tougher than that, more complicated and more human than a love-in. &apos;Of course there is a lot of love going round,&apos; says Nabeel. &apos;The Divan sex workshop! But it gets difficult. People are coming from hostile backgrounds - but that&apos;s not important.&apos; Nabeel provides an analogy that befits the engineer he is, who knows about how a skyscraper would snap if its beams were rigid, and needs the elasticity to sway in the wind. &apos;What is important is: does it break, or is it flexible enough not to break? The social structure of this orchestra is becoming more and more flexible. Many people don&apos;t agree with others in it, but they accept that other people think like that, and this is already something.&apos; From Nazareth, we head to the coast and Tel Aviv (via an omelette beside the Sea of Galilee near the spot where the five thousand were said to have been fed). It is another short drive into an other world, beginning with traffic jams through the shopping centre of Israel&apos;s capital of secular hedonism -sur-mer , a frappuccino in the university campus and at last a meeting with the Divan orchestra cellist, Noa Chorin, in the flat she shares two blocks back from the seafront. Noa talks like a songbird sings. But first she relates with a shudder and a soft smile of relief how &apos;my parents came to Israel as part of the kibbutz movement before the Holocaust, otherwise, I don&apos;t think I would exist. My mother&apos;s parents were from Poland, and all those in my grandparents&apos; families who stayed in Europe died.&apos; She grew up in a kibbutz close to the Lebanon border, an area which came under heavy fire from the Iranian-backed Hizbollah militia during the recent war: &apos;We heard the Katyusha rockets coming - they burned the kibbutzes around, but didn&apos;t get us. I was so afraid, my dogs were terrified.&apos; Her mother taught music and Noa started with the cello aged nine: &apos;I was the only person I knew who played. There was no orchestra, no competition, no concerts, no one to compare myself to. I joined the kibbutz youth orchestra with children from all over the country, but that was only three times a year.&apos; Then she won a place to study at Tel Aviv, &apos;and when I arrived, I didn&apos;t even know how to post a letter to my parents. The lady at the post office said: &quot;So do you want a stamp?&quot;&apos; Noa speaks beautifully about herself and music. She says her teacher &apos;tells me I play like he did when he was 17, and sometimes that I get out of control and should play with a little less passion&apos;. She talks about her love for Dvorak (and plays some of the adagio from his cello concerto), but insists that &apos;the Bach cello suites are romantic music too, and we know that the baroque cellists used vibrato, whatever they say now&apos;. This chimes with Nabeel&apos;s point about &apos;technical science&apos;, and with the essence of Barenboim&apos;s inspiration. &apos;You feel passion and energy just by looking at him conduct, and play with passion and energy.&apos; She finds it &apos;very hard being a musician, having to practise all the time, never going to the beach with everyone else. If I take time off, I feel bad. But I carry on because when you play in the Divan, you are doing something beyond you.&apos; Noa, now 23, had six days notice for her audition for the Divan in 2005. &apos;And when I got there, it felt completely natural. Because we were all from the Middle East, different cultures but same temperament, same character.&apos; The only hard part, she says, was playing Wagner - &apos;the music that was played when Jews were being sent to gas chambers. But I played it, and it was so powerful and beautiful. If it had not been so beautiful, it would not have been so difficult.&apos; With the Divan, &apos;we live another reality, a good reality. You make good friends, then you see them next year. You party together - there&apos;s no dinner in any restaurant without music and dancing. We play the Beatles, Pearl Jam, Arab and Israeli music, we get our instruments out and play. In Israel, it&apos;s impossible for us to hear the other side of the story. I know something about what is happening in Palestine, but it became clearer, more personal. Even more beautiful, though, was when we didn&apos;t want to talk about it. When I am playing next to Dana from Syria I don&apos;t think &quot;She&apos;s from Syria&quot;, I think &quot;that&apos;s my friend Dana&quot;. We talked about boys, girls or Mozart. There is a lot of romance.&apos; Between Israelis and Palestinians? &apos;My friend is with a man from Nazareth, but they had to go and live in Germany. It&apos;s very hard to have a relationship between Arabs and Jews, and I don&apos;t know of a relationship between an Israeli and someone from Palestine.&apos; Then, during the Lebanon war, this changed for Noa. &apos;Suddenly, I felt the need to defend my country. The kibbutzes were burning. It was harder to be away than at home - I was so worried. My father is a high-ranking reservist in the army, and was called up. My parents never went to the shelter - their attitude was: if it happens, it happens. Barenboim always said the Israeli government was doing terrible damage in Lebanon, but I thought what about the north of Israel? I felt not only afraid, but also defensive.&apos; But &apos;the music was the connection, and when people are doing something they really love together, it makes them closer in life, as well as in music&apos;. So that by the time of the concert in Ramallah, &apos;it felt so strange to say goodbye to each other and then meet in Ramallah three days later, because we had to come different ways. I had been afraid, because all I knew about Ramallah was the lynching of two Israeli soldiers there. But I was excited, and it was so emotional to see each other again. They were proud of us for coming. It was weird because it wasn&apos;t the usual audience - they clapped in between movements. But one girl said we were the first Israelis she had ever seen that were not soldiers. And when it came to say goodbye, and go our different ways, people were crying. It was very sad to go back to real life - hard and strange.&apos; We say we are going back to Ramallah tomorrow, to see Ramzi. &apos;Oh, please say hello for me.&apos; Contintues.

Much of Europe lay in ruins. The United States faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination. This menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale. The Soviet Union didn&apos;t yet have an atomic bomb, but before long it would. The challenge facing the greatest generation of Americans - the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield - was how to contain this threat while extending freedom&apos;s frontiers. Leaders like Truman and Acheson, Kennan and Marshall, knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom. We needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world. Such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment. It would shape events not just through military force, but through the force of our ideas; through economic power, intelligence and diplomacy. It would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy; open markets and the rule of law. It would foster new international institutions like the United Nations, Nato, and the World Bank, and focus on every corner of the globe. It was a strategy that saw clearly the world&apos;s dangers, while seizing its promise. As a general, Marshall had spent years helping FDR wage war. But the Marshall Plan - which was just one part of this strategy - helped rebuild not just allies, but also the nation that Marshall had plotted to defeat. In the speech announcing his plan, he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations - but rather with questions and a call for perspective. &quot;The whole world of the future,&quot; Marshall said, &quot;hangs on a proper judgment.&quot; To make that judgment, he asked the American people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity. He closed by asking: &quot;What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?&quot; What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done? Today&apos;s dangers are different, though no less grave. The power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists. The future of our security - and our planet - is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas. From the cave-spotted mountains of northwest Pakistan, to the centrifuges spinning beneath Iranian soil, we know that the American people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone. The attacks of September 11 brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus. On that bright and beautiful day, the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our Cold War victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble, and twisted steel, and clouds of smoke. But the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation. At blood banks and vigils; in schools and in the United States Congress, Americans were united - more united, even, than we were at the dawn of the Cold War. The world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old allies, new friends, and even long-time adversaries stood by our side. It was time - once again - for America&apos;s might and moral suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever-changing world. Imagine, for a moment, what we could have done in those days, and months, and years after 9/11. We could have deployed the full force of American power to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida, the Taliban, and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in Afghanistan. We could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world, and updated a 20th century non-proliferation framework to meet the challenges of the 21st. We could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy, save our planet, and end the tyranny of oil. We could have strengthened old alliances, formed new partnerships, and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity. We could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history, and to serve their country as troops and teachers, Peace Corps volunteers and police officers. We could have secured our homeland--investing in sophisticated new protection for our ports, our trains and our power plants. We could have rebuilt our roads and bridges, laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems, and made college affordable for every American to strengthen our ability to compete. We could have done that. Instead, we have lost thousands of American lives, spent nearly a trillion dollars, alienated allies and neglected emerging threats - all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them. What&apos;s missing in our debate about Iraq - what has been missing since before the war began - is a discussion of the strategic consequences of Iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy. This war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize. This war diminishes our security, our standing in the world, our military, our economy, and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century. By any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe. I am running for President of the United States to lead this country in a new direction - to seize this moment&apos;s promise. Instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face, I want to overcome them. Instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military, I want to use all elements of American power to keep us safe, and prosperous, and free. Instead of alienating ourselves from the world, I want America - once again - to lead. As President, I will pursue a tough, smart and principled national security strategy - one that recognizes that we have interests not just in Baghdad, but in Kandahar and Karachi, in Tokyo and London, in Beijing and Berlin. I will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making America safer: ending the war in Iraq responsibly; finishing the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban; securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states; achieving true energy security; and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century. My opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor, and we all respect his sacrifice. We both want to do what we think is best to defend the American people. But we&apos;ve made different judgments, and would lead in very different directions. That starts with Iraq. I opposed going to war in Iraq; Senator McCain was one of Washington&apos;s biggest supporters for war. I warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism, and distract us from the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban; Senator McCain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators, and that democracy would spread across the Middle East. Those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the Cold War. Now, all of us recognize that we must do more than look back - we must make a judgment about how to move forward. What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done? Senator McCain wants to talk of our tactics in Iraq; I want to focus on a new strategy for Iraq and the wider world. It has been 18 months since President Bush announced the surge. As I have said many times, our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence. General Petraeus has used new tactics to protect the Iraqi population. We have talked directly to Sunni tribes that used to be hostile to America, and supported their fight against al-Qaida. Shiite militias have generally respected a cease-fire. Those are the facts, and all Americans welcome them. For weeks, now, Senator McCain has argued that the gains of the surge mean that I should change my commitment to end the war. But this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in Iraq, and stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that we face. In the 18 months since the surge began, the strain on our military has increased, our troops and their families have borne an enormous burden, and American taxpayers have spent another $200 billion in Iraq. That&apos;s over $10 billion each month. That is a consequence of our current strategy. In the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. June was our highest casualty month of the war. The Taliban has been on the offensive, even launching a brazen attack on one of our bases. Al-Qaida has a growing sanctuary in Pakistan. That is a consequence of our current strategy. In the 18 months since the surge began, as I warned at the outset - Iraq&apos;s leaders have not made the political progress that was the purpose of the surge. They have not invested tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country. They have not resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact. That&apos;s why I strongly stand by my plan to end this war. Now, Prime Minister Maliki&apos;s call for a timetable for the removal of U.S. forces presents a real opportunity. It comes at a time when the American general in charge of training Iraq&apos;s Security Forces has testified that Iraq&apos;s Army and Police will be ready to assume responsibility for Iraq&apos;s security in 2009. Now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes Iraq&apos;s leaders toward a political solution, rebuilds our military, and refocuses on Afghanistan and our broader security interests. George Bush and John McCain don&apos;t have a strategy for success in Iraq - they have a strategy for staying in Iraq. They said we couldn&apos;t leave when violence was up, they say we can&apos;t leave when violence is down. They refuse to press the Iraqis to make tough choices, and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops &quot;surrender,&quot; even though we would be turning Iraq over to a sovereign Iraqi government - not to a terrorist enemy. Theirs is an endless focus on tactics inside Iraq, with no consideration of our strategy to face threats beyond Iraq&apos;s borders. At some point, a judgment must be made. Iraq is not going to be a perfect place, and we don&apos;t have unlimited resources to try to make it one. We are not going to kill every al-Qaida sympathizer, eliminate every trace of Iranian influence, or stand up a flawless democracy before we leave - General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker acknowledged this to me when they testified last April. That is why the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a failed policy. In fact, true success in Iraq - victory in Iraq - will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms. True success will take place when we leave Iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future - a government that prevents sectarian conflict, and ensures that the al-Qaida threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge. That is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive plan to press the Iraqis stand up. To achieve that success, I will give our military a new mission on my first day in office: ending this war. Let me be clear: we must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in. We can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months. That would be the summer of 2010 - one year after Iraqi Security Forces will be prepared to stand up; two years from now, and more than seven years after the war began. After this redeployment, we&apos;ll keep a residual force to perform specific missions in Iraq: targeting any remnants of al-Qaida; protecting our service members and diplomats; and training and supporting Iraq&apos;s Security Forces, so long as the Iraqis make political progress. We will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy - that is what any responsible Commander-in-Chief must do. As I have consistently said, I will consult with commanders on the ground and the Iraqi government. We will redeploy from secure areas first and volatile areas later. We will commit $2 billion to a meaningful international effort to support the more than 4 million displaced Iraqis. We will forge a new coalition to support Iraq&apos;s future - one that includes all of Iraq&apos;s neighbors, and also the United Nations, the World Bank, and the European Union - because we all have a stake in stability. And we will make it clear that the United States seeks no permanent bases in Iraq. This is the future that Iraqis want. This is the future that the American people want. And this is what our common interests demand. Both America and Iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in Anbar is taken out by the Iraqi Army, and the criminal in Baghdad fears Iraqi Police, not just coalition forces. Both America and Iraq will succeed when every Arab government has an embassy open in Baghdad, and the child in Basra benefits from services provided by Iraqi dinars, not American tax dollars. And this is the future we need for our military. We cannot tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that hasn&apos;t made us safer. I will restore our strength by ending this war, completing the increase of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 marines, and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our time. So let&apos;s be clear. Senator McCain would have our troops continue to fight tour after tour of duty, and our taxpayers keep spending $10 billion a month indefinitely; I want Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future, and to reach the political accommodation necessary for long-term stability. That&apos;s victory. That&apos;s success. That&apos;s what&apos;s best for Iraq, that&apos;s what&apos;s best for America, and that&apos;s why I will end this war as President. In fact - as should have been apparent to President Bush and Senator McCain - the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq, and it never was. That&apos;s why the second goal of my new strategy will be taking the fight to al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3,000 Americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 are still at large. Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahari are recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror. The Taliban controls parts of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida has an expanding base in Pakistan that is probably no farther from their old Afghan sanctuary than a train ride from Washington to Philadelphia. If another attack on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the same region where 9/11 was planned. And yet today, we have five times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan. Senator McCain said - just months ago - that &quot;Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq.&quot; I could not disagree more. Our troops and our Nato allies are performing heroically in Afghanistan, but I have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to Iraq. That&apos;s what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier this month. And that&apos;s why, as President, I will make the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have to win. I will send at least two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan, and use this commitment to seek greater contributions - with fewer restrictions - from Nato allies. I will focus on training Afghan security forces and supporting an Afghan judiciary, with more resources and incentives for American officers who perform these missions. Just as we succeeded in the Cold War by supporting allies who could sustain their own security, we must realize that the 21st century&apos;s frontlines are not only on the field of battle - they are found in the training exercise near Kabul, in the police station in Kandahar, and in the rule of law in Herat. Moreover, lasting security will only come if we heed Marshall&apos;s lesson, and help Afghans grow their economy from the bottom up. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve proposed an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance each year, with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made - not just in Kabul - but out in Afghanistan&apos;s provinces. As a part of this program, we&apos;ll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy-growing for Afghan farmers, just as we crack down on heroin trafficking. We cannot lose Afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism. The Afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring, because the security of Afghanistan and the United States is shared. The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into Afghanistan. We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and as President, I won&apos;t. We need a stronger and sustained partnership between Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nato to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps, and to crack down on cross-border insurgents. We need more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more Predator drones in the Afghan border region. And we must make it clear that if Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights. Make no mistake: we can&apos;t succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy. We must expect more of the Pakistani government, but we must offer more than a blank check to a General who has lost the confidence of his people. It&apos;s time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the Pakistani people. That&apos;s why I&apos;m cosponsoring a bill with Joe Biden and Richard Lugar to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al-Qaida. We must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience, or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear-armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical Islam. Only a strong Pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal - securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states. One of the terrible ironies of the Iraq War is that President Bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program. But the fact that the President misled us into a misguided war doesn&apos;t diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction - in fact, it has only increased it. In those years after World War II, we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the Kremlin. Now, we worry about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium - some of it poorly secured - at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries. Now, we worry about the breakdown of a non-proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the Cold War. Now, we worry - most of all - about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world&apos;s deadliest weapons to the world&apos;s most dangerous people: terrorists who won&apos;t think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in Tel Aviv or Moscow, in London or New York. We cannot wait any longer to protect the American people. I&apos;ve made this a priority in the Senate, where I worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials. I&apos;ll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as President. And I&apos;ll develop new defenses to protect against the 21st century threat of biological weapons and cyber-terrorism - threats that I&apos;ll discuss in more detail tomorrow. Beyond taking these immediate, urgent steps, it&apos;s time to send a clear message: America seeks a world with no nuclear weapons. As long as nuclear weapons exist, we must retain a strong deterrent. But instead of threatening to kick them out of the G-8, we need to work with Russia to take U.S. and Russian ballistic missiles off hair-trigger alert; to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material; to seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons; and to expand the U.S.-Russian ban on intermediate-range missiles so that the agreement is global. By keeping our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we&apos;ll be in a better position to press nations like North Korea and Iran to keep theirs. In particular, it will give us more credibility and leverage in dealing with Iran. We cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror. Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the United States. No tool of statecraft should be taken off the table, but Senator McCain would continue a failed policy that has seen Iran strengthen its position, advance its nuclear program, and stockpile 150 kilos of low enriched uranium. I will use all elements of American power to pressure the Iranian regime, starting with aggressive, principled and direct diplomacy - diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without preconditions. There will be careful preparation. I commend the work of our European allies on this important matter, and we should be full partners in that effort. Ultimately the measure of any effort is whether it leads to a change in Iranian behavior. That&apos;s why we must pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our allies, bringing to bear our full influence - including, if it will advance our interests, my meeting with the appropriate Iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing. We will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the Iranian regime. Instead, we will present a clear choice. If you abandon your nuclear program, support for terror, and threats to Israel, there will be meaningful incentives. If you refuse, then we will ratchet up the pressure, with stronger unilateral sanctions; stronger multilateral sanctions in the Security Council, and sustained action outside the UN to isolate the Iranian regime. That&apos;s the diplomacy we need. And the Iranians should negotiate now; by waiting, they will only face mounting pressure. The surest way to increase our leverage against Iran in the long-run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions. That will depend on achieving my fourth goal: ending the tyranny of oil in our time. One of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil. We ship nearly $700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil. It pays for terrorist bombs going off from Baghdad to Beirut. It funds petro-diplomacy in Caracas and radical madrasas from Karachi to Khartoum. It takes leverage away from America and shifts it to dictators. This immediate danger is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine. That means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline. This is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern - this is a national security crisis. For the sake of our security - and for every American family that is paying the price at the pump - we must end this dependence on foreign oil. And as President, that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;ll do. Small steps and political gimmickry just won&apos;t do. I&apos;ll invest $150 billion over the next ten years to put America on the path to true energy security. This fund will fast track investments in a new green energy business sector that will end our addiction to oil and create up to 5 million jobs over the next two decades, and help secure the future of our country and our planet. We&apos;ll invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy - solar, wind, and biofuels, as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe. And from the moment I take office, I will let it be known that the United States of America is ready to lead again. Never again will we sit on the sidelines, or stand in the way of global action to tackle this global challenge. I will reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new Global Energy Forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols. We will also build an alliance of oil-importing nations and work together to reduce our demand, and to break the grip of OPEC on the global economy. We&apos;ll set a goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050. And as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home, we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world. That is the tradition of American leadership on behalf of the global good. And that will be my fifth goal - rebuilding our alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century. For all of our power, America is strongest when we act alongside strong partners. We faced down fascism with the greatest war-time alliance the world has ever known. We stood shoulder to shoulder with our Nato allies against the Soviet threat, and paid a far smaller price for the first Gulf War because we acted together with a broad coalition. We helped create the United Nations - not to constrain America&apos;s influence, but to amplify it by advancing our values. Now is the time for a new era of international cooperation. It&apos;s time for America and Europe to renew our common commitment to face down the threats of the 21st century just as we did the challenges of the 20th. It&apos;s time to strengthen our partnerships with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the world&apos;s largest democracy - India - to create a stable and prosperous Asia. It&apos;s time to engage China on common interests like climate change, even as we continue to encourage their shift to a more open and market-based society. It&apos;s time to strengthen Nato by asking more of our allies, while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner. It&apos;s time to reform the United Nations, so that this imperfect institution can become a more perfect forum to share burdens, strengthen our leverage, and promote our values. It&apos;s time to deepen our engagement to help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, so that we help our ally Israel achieve true and lasting security, while helping Palestinians achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood. And just as we renew longstanding efforts, so must we shape new ones to meet new challenges. That&apos;s why I&apos;ll create a Shared Security Partnership Program - a new alliance of nations to strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist networks, while standing up against torture and brutality. That&apos;s why we&apos;ll work with the African Union to enhance its ability to keep the peace. That&apos;s why we&apos;ll build a new partnership to roll back the trafficking of drugs, and guns, and gangs in the Americas. That&apos;s what we can do if we are ready to engage the world. We will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical priorities. I know development assistance is not the most popular program, but as President, I will make the case to the American people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world. That was true with the Marshall Plan, and that must be true today. That&apos;s why I&apos;ll double our foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, and use it to support a stable future in failing states, and sustainable growth in Africa; to halve global poverty and to roll back disease. To send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, &quot;You matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.&quot; This must be the moment when we answer the call of history. For eight years, we have paid the price for a foreign policy that lectures without listening; that divides us from one another - and from the world - instead of calling us to a common purpose; that focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in Iraq instead of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we face. We cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of balance and out of step with this defining moment. None of this will be easy, but we have faced great odds before. When General Marshall first spoke about the plan that would bear his name, the rubble of Berlin had not yet been built into a wall. But Marshall knew that even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship founded in freedom. He had the confidence to know that the purpose and pragmatism of the American people could outlast any foe. Today, the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the Cold War have receded. Now, the defeat of the threats of the past has been replaced by the transnational threats of today. We know what is needed. We know what can best be done. We know what must done. Now it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism as an earlier generation, to join with friends and partners to lead the world anew.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-16T09:26:29Z", "title": "Full text: Obama's foreign policy speech", "sentences": ["Now, we worry - most of all - about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world&apos;s deadliest weapons to the world&apos;s most dangerous people: terrorists who won&apos;t think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in Tel Aviv or Moscow, in London or New York."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/16/uselections2008.barackobama"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Samir Kuntar A Lebanese Druze, Kuntar was 17 in 1979 when he took part in a raid on the Israeli coastal town of Nahariya on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Front. Captured and tried, he was sentenced to multiple life sentences amounting to 542 years for killing an Israeli policeman, a civilian called Danny Haran and his four-year-old daughter, whose skull he smashed with a rifle butt. Compounding the tragedy, Haran&apos;s terrified wife Smadar hid in a wardrobe with another daughter but accidentally smothered her to death while trying to stop her crying. Kuntar, now 41, is a hero to many Lebanese and Palestinians and is reviled in Israel as a despicable murderer.

Both were doing reserve military service at the time. Goldwasser, who was married, worked at the Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology. Regev, who was single, worked for the Israeli telephone company Bezeq. (IB) Dalal al-Mughrabi As an 18-year-old Palestinian girl from Lebanon, she led a bloody attack against Israel that still haunts the public imagination on both sides of the border 30 years later. In 1978, Mughrabi led a team of 13 Palestinian and Lebanese fighters who landed at Jaffa beach intent on attacking the ministry of defence in Tel Aviv. On the coastal highway, Mughrabi&apos;s team hijacked two buses carrying civilians. An intense 15-hour gun battle ensued with forces led by future Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. Mughrabi raised her national flag and declared the Palestinian state.* One of the buses exploded, killing many inside. Israel says Mughrabi threw grenades into it; Palestinians maintain the bus was fired on from the air by Israeli helicopters. At least 37 Israelis (Palestinians claim 70) were killed, as well as 11 guerrillas. Mughrabi&apos;s body was dragged off the tarmac and shot several times by Barak in images captured by the media. (HM) Ron Arad Absent from today&apos;s swap will be Israel&apos;s most famous missing soldier, Ron Arad. In 1986, the 28-year-old Arad was navigating his Phantom fighter jet on a mission to attack Palestinian targets near the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon. The fighter&apos;s ordenance is thought to have exploded in mid-air, forcing Arad and the pilot to eject. Israeli forces rescued the pilot a few hours later, but Arad was captured by the Shia militia group Amal, then the dominant force over the still fledgling Hizbullah. Following a year of failed talks over a prisoner exchange, nothing further has been heard of the missing airman. His fate has gripped a generation of Israelis. Was he taken to Iran, as Israeli media reports have suggested, by Revolutionary Guards working with Hizbullah? Did he die in Lebanon? And if so, how? Last weekend Israelis pored over 20-year-old pictures of a bearded Arad just received from Hizbullah, along with diary excerpts and an 80-page-report into the group&apos;s investigation into the missing airman. Hizbullah said they believed Arad was killed in an Israeli raid on a village in south Lebanon in 1988, but only offered what Israeli officials said was an incomplete account.

Since 1987 he worked as a freelance correspondent for a wide variety of outlets, becoming recognised as a leading reporter and interpreter of Israeli affairs and the Middle East peace process as seen from Jerusalem.  His Yorkshire upbringing and early career had not marked him out for what was to prove a mid-life shift, though as a young man he had been a member of the Habonim Zionist youth movement. As a teenager he put his ambition to be a journalist before all else, and his Zionism was put on hold until he was able to combine life in Israel with journalism. Eric was born in Leeds, the only son of a Jewish family with roots in Lithuania; his father was an immigrant, his mother English-born. From Roundhay grammar school, Leeds, he won an exhibition to St Catherine&apos;s College, Oxford, where he read philosophy, politics and economics. After a short period in provincial journalism, he joined the Guardian (still based in Manchester) in 1960 as a subeditor, handling first home, then foreign news. When the paper moved its headquarters to London in 1964, he moved south as a general reporter, taking a particular interest in immigration and race. From 1966 to 1967 he was deputy labour correspondent.  In 1967 Eric had his first experience of reporting on Israel, when the Guardian sent him to cover the aftermath of the six-day war. Back in London from 1968 to 1972, he ran the Miscellany gossip column, taking over from the paper&apos;s future editor, Peter Preston. Then, in 1972, he was appointed Jerusalem correspondent of both the Guardian and the Observer, where he was to remain for the next 11 years. This was an extraordinarily busy period for reporting, even by Middle East standards. Eric&apos;s first big story was the Lod airport massacre of May 30 1972, when three members of the Japanese Red Army infiltrated what is now Ben Gurion airport, Tel Aviv, killing 26 people and injuring 80. Then, in September, came the Munich attack, when members of the Israeli Olympics team were taken hostage by Black September terrorists. Eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and five of the eight terrorists died during a rescue attempt.  The following year saw the Yom Kippur war, for which Eric&apos;s main role was as an anchorman coordinating the Guardian&apos;s coverage. Then, in November 1977, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt became the first Arab leader to visit Israel. The following month, Eric was on board the first civilian plane from Israel to Egypt, an opportunity he relished as it offered him the chance to visit other Arab countries, particularly Jordan and Oman.  There were also two small wars with Lebanon, in 1979 and 1982, and the following year he took leave of absence to write a biography of Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister who had negotiated the 1978 Camp David accords and the peace treaty with Sadat. The book appeared in 1984. Eric&apos;s Jerusalem assignment was supposed to last between three and four years, but he resisted all efforts to persuade him to return to London. The Guardian, which in those days was far more indulgent with the foibles of its correspondents, allowed him to stay on, even though senior staff felt that he was &quot;going native&quot; and that his reporting was no longer sufficiently objective.  It was not until 1983 that he was persuaded to move to Delhi as India correspondent. He enjoyed the challenge of setting up a new bureau and travelled widely in the region, visiting Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Four years later, he was offered the post of chief foreign leader writer in London, but it was not a task he wanted, and, after much agonising, he and his wife Bridget decided to return to Jerusalem, where they already owned a house.  For the first time in his career, Eric found himself having to make a living out of freelancing. A colleague told him that the Middle East story was dying, but six months later the first Palestinian intifada broke out and the region was again big news. As events accelerated, Eric built a formidable array of outlets that included long-term contracts with the Independent and the Jewish Chronicle. He became a regular contributor to the BBC World Service and did work for the BBC Newsnight programme and CNN. For a period, he was senior editor of the Jerusalem News and Report, and he frequently contributed to Time magazine, Macleans magazine in Toronto and the Statesman in Calcutta.  He followed up the success of his Begin biography with The Book of the Just: The Unsung Heroes Who Rescued Jews from Hitler (1992), about so-called righteous Gentiles (such as Oskar Schindler) who had been prepared to risk all to rescue Jews from the Holocaust. The book won several prizes. Eric was steadfast, loyal and dependable. And, of course, he was an excellent reporter and writer. We joined the Guardian at roughly the same time, but only became good friends after I returned from my first assignment in the US. In 1971, he performed a never-to-be-forgotten act of friendship when he was asked by the editor to give me the news of my mother&apos;s sudden death. He organised my return from Brussels, was waiting for me at Heathrow airport and helped with everything that needed to be done. He also helped with crucial research for my biography of Simon Wiesenthal. Eric never cut his ties with Britain, and cherished the friendships he had formed among the media community. He and Bridget were regular visitors to London as two of their daughters, Rachel and Sharon, live here with their families. Their third daughter, Dinah, is married and lives in Jerusalem. They survive him, as does his wife.  \u00b7 Eric Silver, writer and journalist, born July 8 1935; died July 15 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-07-16T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Eric Silver", "sentences": ["Eric&apos;s first big story was the Lod airport massacre of May 30 1972, when three members of the Japanese Red Army infiltrated what is now Ben Gurion airport, Tel Aviv, killing 26 people and injuring 80."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business"], "article": "The global leader in copycat drugs, Teva Pharmaceuticals, is taking over a US rival, Barr Pharmaceuticals, in a $7.5bn deal which continues a rapid spate of consolidation in the crowded industry for generic medicines. The Israel-based company&apos;s purchase of Barr will put it further ahead of the pack as the world&apos;s biggest maker of generics - drugs for which developers&apos; patent protection has expired, allowing rivals to fill the market with cut-price versions. &quot;We believe we are paying a fair price for a very good company with a great strategic rationale which will provide benefits for many years to come,&quot; said Teva&apos;s chief executive, Shlomo Yanai. He added that there was &quot;minimal overlap between the two companies&quot;, although the deal is likely to be scrutinised by competition regulators. Generics is a hot area in the drugs industry because a spate of blockbuster medicines are reaching the end of their patents. Among them are Merck&apos;s osteoporosis drug Fosamax, AstraZeneca&apos;s cancer treatment Casodex and Glaxo SmithKline&apos;s asthma medicines Advair and Serevent. At the same time, there is intense political pressure to reduce the cost of healthcare, particularly in the US where retailers such as Wal-Mart are driving increasingly hard bargains for cut-price drugs. Buying New Jersey-based Barr will give Teva an increased presence in central and eastern Europe, which are considered promising areas for healthcare spending.  Teva will also inherit Barr&apos;s expertise in women&apos;s healthcare - its products include two oral contraceptives, Seasonique and Seasonale, and a version of the morning-after pill. The company became a global generics powerhouse two years ago when it bought another US business, Ivax. But it has suffered several setbacks recently including disappointing trial results for a new version of a multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone.  Yoav Burgan, a drugs analyst at Leader Capital Markets in Tel Aviv, said: &quot;Businesswise, the acquisition makes tons of sense for Teva.&quot; Teva lost out recently in a struggle to buy Merck&apos;s generics business and Burgan said its management was under pressure to deliver: &quot;All these circumstances intensified the incentive of Teva management to show off a very substantial and high quality acquisition such as Barr.&quot; Several other deals have taken place recently between makers of copycat drugs. Japan&apos;s Daiichi Sankyo bought a stake in India&apos;s Ranbaxy, while Germany&apos;s Fresenius struck a deal to buy US firm APP Pharmaceuticals. Merck sold its generics business last year to Mylan Laboratories for \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn). At present, the industry is relatively fragmented. Prices for drugs typically fall by as much as 80% once patent protection ends, as manufacturers fight to deliver the lowest price. But larger players are beginning to flex their muscles through acquisitions which suck up market share. Ricky Goldwasser, an analyst at UBS, described Teva&apos;s purchase of Barr as &quot;both strategic and operationally sound&quot;. In a research note, he said: &quot;The combination allows Teva to even further establish its position in both the US and eastern European market, and boost its pipeline.&quot; The purchase price for Barr of $7.5bn (\u00a33.75bn) includes $1.5bn of debt. It valued Barr at $66.50 a share, sending the company&apos;s stock price leaping by 10% to $63.25.  Teva said the deal was likely to close by the end of the year. It suggested that the acquisition would enhance its earnings within three months of completion. The combined company will have operations in 60 countries employing more than 37,000 people. Between them, they generated sales of $11.9bn last year.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-18T23:01:00Z", "title": "Israel's Teva buys US copycat drug rival for $7.5bn", "sentences": ["Yoav Burgan, a drugs analyst at Leader Capital Markets in Tel Aviv, said: &quot;Businesswise, the acquisition makes tons of sense for Teva.&quot; Teva lost out recently in a struggle to buy Merck&apos;s generics business and Burgan said its management was under pressure to deliver: &quot;All these circumstances intensified the incentive of Teva management to show off a very substantial and high quality acquisition such as Barr.&quot; Several other deals have taken place recently between makers of copycat drugs."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/19/pharmaceuticals"}, {"tags": ["Internet", "Google", "Technology", "Digital media", "Media", "US news", "World news", "Time magazine", "4chan"], "article": "It seemed an ordinary day at Google&apos;s offices in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Such phenomena are known as &apos;memes&apos; - cultural fragments that catch someone&apos;s eye, get forwarded to friends and spread like a virus. The invisible hand behind many memes, apparently including the googled swastika, is a website called 4chan. From semi-literate cats to the &apos;ironic&apos; comeback of singer Rick Astley, this online community is building a reputation as a nursery of all that is weird and wacky and likely to be landing in your inbox tomorrow. Suddenly, 4chan&apos;s elusive creator found himself the subject of articles in two of America&apos;s heavyweight publications: Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal, which named him as Christopher Poole, a New Yorker who was only 15 when, with the help of his mother&apos;s credit card, he launched 4chan from his bedroom five years ago. Time hailed him as the &apos;Master Of Memes&apos; and described 4chan as &apos;the wellspring from which a lot of internet culture, and hence popular culture, bubbles&apos;. But how does it work? 4chan began as a simple message board with pictures and text. Anyone could contribute on any subject, posting a photograph of their pet, sounding off about a politician, debating the merits of a player. Sometimes other users will reply and begin a strand of conversation. The images and comments now appear under 44 topic headings ranging from fashion, sports and video games to weapons, the paranormal and &apos;sexy beautiful women&apos; - the most popular by a long way is &apos;Random&apos;. Inspired by a forum in Japan, the site has an unpolished retro look, as rough and ready as a scrapbook. It is an online community at its purest and rawest, the antithesis of polished networks such as Facebook: 4chan is like a brick wall where people can daub graffiti without fear of a comeback. Child pornography is banned, but otherwise there are few rules. Some posts are gloriously childish and nonsensical. Others can be racist, homophobic and misogynistic and peppered with four-letter words. Unlike most social networks, no one has to register a name or sign in. Consequently, the community has been described as a lawless Wild West of the web, a place of uninhibited bawdiness and verbal violence. A teenager in Texas posted a photograph of hoax pipe bombs and a threat to blow up his school on the anniversary of 9/11, but another user contacted police and the teenager was arrested.  However, the free-for-all has also been liberating, turning 4chan into an ideas laboratory and unleashing a ferocious creative force. Though most of what appears soon vanishes and is forgotten, the stuff that survives can easily jump to the wider web community and &apos;go viral&apos;, passing from person to person across the world. It is an ability envied by advertising agencies, which have long sought to drum up publicity by word of mouth or now through viral videos of their own, relying on users to do the work for them. But 4chan just does it for fun with the help of a big army of users: 8.5 million page views a day and 3.3 million visitors a month. The swastika was one such stunt. It appears that a post on 4chan instructed people to Google &apos;...#21328;&apos;. When thousands did, they discovered that it was a piece of code which, when processed by a web browser, translates into a swastika. Their collective curiosity unwittingly sent the symbol soaring to the top of Google&apos;s Hot Trends. One of 4chan&apos;s biggest hits is a prank known as &apos;bait-and-switch&apos;. You receive a link to an &apos;amazing website&apos;. But when you click, it is in fact a link to a music video for Rick Astley&apos;s 1987 hit single &apos;Never Gonna Give You Up&apos;. It is estimated that more than 10 million people have been &apos;rickrolled&apos;. The first such joke on 4chan was &apos;duckrolling&apos;, in which a link to a popular celebrity or news item would instead lead to a photomontage of a duck with wheels. In another parade of silliness, 4chan users began a Saturday ritual of posting pictures of cats, for no particular reason except that they could. This soon became known as &apos;Caturday&apos;, with humorous phrases posted beside the so-called &apos;LOLcats&apos; - now the subject of LOLcat T-shirts, buttons and fridge magnets. When a plump grey cat appeared with the caption &apos;I can has cheezburger?&apos;, it caught the imagination of a man in Hawaii and became the subject of his blog, icanhascheezburger.com. The blog was sold for about $2m (\u00a31m). Last week 4chan was at it again. The site rallied users to search for &apos;Scientology is a cult&apos; and, written upside down, the words &apos;fuck you Google&apos;. Again, both leapt to the top of Google Hot Trends before being removed. 4chan users were also accused of attacking Habbo, a virtual world for children, by flooding it with avatars made to look like black men wearing Armani suits. In a previous raid, they lined up avatars to form the shape of a swastika. Poole had never revealed his identity until Time and the Wall Street Journal came calling. When contacted by The Observer through email, he replied: &apos;I am extremely busy this week and will not have time to conduct a phone interview.&apos; He suggested questions by email but did not respond to them. His message was signed &apos;moot&apos;, a code name he uses on 4chan for reasons no one has yet fathomed. &apos;My personal private life is very separate from my internet life,&apos; he told Time. &apos;There&apos;s a firewall in between.&apos; Poole set up 4chan because he wanted to share his passion for Japanese comics and TV rather than as a moneyspinner, which is just as well. Although the site is popular, its scurrilous reputation makes it difficult to sell advertising space. Poole said: &apos;That&apos;s been an uphill battle for me personally. My biggest time spent has been convincing companies in marketing potential in 4chan but no one sees eye to eye.&apos; For now he will have to be content with shaping western culture as the most influential web entrepreneur you&apos;ve never heard of. &apos;Coarse as it is, 4chan has no rival as a hothouse for memes; they&apos;re bred and refined, and then they can escape and run amuck through the culture at large,&apos; Time enthused. &apos;For better or for worse, this is what the counterculture looks like today: raw, sarcastic, bare of any social or political agenda but frequently funny as hell.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-07-19T23:01:00Z", "title": "The 20-year-old at heart of web's most anarchic and influential site", "sentences": ["It seemed an ordinary day at Google&apos;s offices in Tel Aviv, Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/20/internet.google"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "US politics"], "article": "Barack Obama today pledged to &quot;not waste a minute&quot; in tackling the Middle East conflict if elected president, Palestinian officials said. The Democratic presidential hopeful made the commitment after meeting the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah in the West Bank. Saeb Erekat, an aide to Abbas, said Obama was willing to immediately engage in peace efforts. &quot;Obama confirmed to President Abbas that he will be a constructive partner in the peace process,&quot; he said, adding that Obama told Abbas he would &quot;not waste a minute&quot; if elected in November. Obama talked to Palestinian leaders after earlier telling Israeli officials he wanted to be a partner in bringing peace to the region. &quot;I&apos;m here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between Israel and the United States, my abiding commitment to its security, and my hope that I can serve as an effective partner, whether as a ... senator or as a president, in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region,&quot; he said. Obama, an Illinois senator, described Israel as a &quot;miracle that has blossomed&quot; since its founding 60 years ago, after meeting the Israeli president, Shimon Peres. Later, wearing a Jewish skullcap, he laid a white wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum. &quot;Let our children come here and know this history so that they can add their voices to proclaim &apos;never again&apos;,&quot; Obama wrote in the museum&apos;s visitors&apos; book. Obama met the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and the opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. He will also hold talks with the foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and the prime minister, Ehud Olmert - who is fighting for his political survival amid accusations of corruption. Obama, who faces John McCain in the November election, dismayed Palestinian leaders last month when he said Jerusalem should be Israel&apos;s &quot;undivided&quot; capital, even though no US government has recognised Israel&apos;s 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, claimed by the Palestinians as their future capital. Later, Obama said he used &quot;poor phrasing&quot; when he made the remarks. Palestinian officials said they did not bring up the Jerusalem remarks in their meeting with Obama. However, Kadoura Fares, an MP in Abbas&apos; Fatah party, strongly criticised Obama&apos;s slip. &quot;His correction was not enough,&quot; Fares said. &quot;He should have said he recognises the Palestinian right to freedom.&quot; Hamas, the Islamists who control Gaza, said Obama was not welcome and criticised Abbas for receiving him. &quot;Obama wants to go to the White House through Tel Aviv, at the expense of the Palestinians,&quot; said Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman. Abbas aides insist the Palestinian leader&apos;s meeting with Obama offered an important opportunity. Abbas listed Palestinian grievances, including Israel&apos;s continued settlement construction and refusal to ease restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank, said Erekat. As part of his visit, Obama will stop in the Israeli town of Sderot, near the border with Gaza strip and the frequent target of rockets fired by Palestinian militants. The attacks have largely subsided since an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire took hold last month. McCain visited Sderot in March, but did not go to the West Bank.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-23T09:01:37Z", "title": "Barack Obama makes peace promise to Middle East", "sentences": ["&quot;Obama wants to go to the White House through Tel Aviv, at the expense of the Palestinians,&quot; said Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/23/barackobama.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, just completed a whirlwind visit to Israel and the West Bank. The trip included meetings with the beleagured Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, foreign minister Tsipi Livni, defence minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Candidate Obama met with families in rocket-torn Sderot, and visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and the West Bank city of Ramallah.  For Israelis, the immediate effect of the trip was to re-introduce some welcome US-style political glamour into the fatigued, fraught and troubled Israeli political landscape. But what, if anything, of significance transpired in the course of the visit? The answer is that Obama in Israel gave the probably genuine impression of being a candidate whose positions on the Middle East place him within the mainstream of his party and of the US discussion on the region.  All polls indicate that Obama already has the support of the majority of American Jews (though in smaller numbers than previous Democratic candidates.) US Jews habitually turn out for the Democratic candidate in large numbers. During the drawn out campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, questions were raised by some US Jewish commentators regarding the candidate&apos;s likely positions on the Middle East.  Obama himself had said little of substance on the issues (and what he said during the campaign was sympathetic to Israel). But concerns focused on some of the people around him. One-time Obama adviser Samantha Power was found to have made remarks indicating a lack of understanding or sympathy for Israeli positions. Obama&apos;s pastor Jeremiah Wright, meanwhile, was discovered to have expressed support for antisemitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.  Obama has since disassociated himself from the positions expressed by these individuals. The impression gained of him since he won the nomination is of a smart and canny politician rather than the messianic figure which some of his dizzier supporters sought to portray. Obama is aware that all polls show that support and sympathy for Israel run very high among the American electorate as a whole. Thus, he is currently in the business of trying to convince Americans as a whole, not just US Jews, that he is a candidate of the centre, worthy of being entrusted with key decisions of grave import. Reiterating his commitment to Israel&apos;s security is one of the ways to do that. That was what Obama was in Israel to do. How did he go about it? The key issues with which Obama sought to engage in Israel were the Iranian nuclear programme, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On Iran, he repeated his staunch opposition to that country&apos;s nuclear ambitions, saying that &quot;A nuclear Iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&quot; Obama made clear his preference for diplomacy as the preferred method for preventing this. No surprises there. He sought to finesse his earlier stated willingness to meet with Iranian leaders.  On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Obama again stuck firmly to the mainstream. He expressed his pleasure that &quot;progress is being made and honest conversations are taking place,&quot; in the talks between Israelis and Palestinians. He sought to refute suspicions that he would favour placing pressure on Israel to make concessions dangerous to its security. In Sderot, Obama made clear his support for Israel&apos;s right to self-defence, noting that &quot;If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night, I would do everything in power to stop that, and would expect Israelis to do the same thing.&quot;  No doubt these statements are all as sincerely heartfelt as those of any political candidate. They also serve Obama&apos;s cause well. An attempted terror attack took place on Tuesday near Obama&apos;s hotel, and he was unequivocal in his condemnation. Obama also received an important endorsement from an unexpected quarter. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum characterised him as seeking to reach the White House &quot;through Tel Aviv&quot;, at &quot;the expense of the Palestinians&quot;. Condemnation from the Islamist rulers of Gaza will be particularly welcomed by the campaign.  Of course, no one expects campaign speeches to be an accurate reflection of policy. Israeli politicians are aware that a Barack Obama presidency is likely to mean increased US hands-on involvement in the process with the Palestinians, and a more conciliatory stance toward Iran. Privately, one may hear some expressions of apprehension in this regard.  But candidate Obama, with his Middle East advisers Dennis Ross and former US ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer, looked this week in Israel like a politician hailing from a particular position well within the familiar landscape of the close US-Israeli relationship. The newspapers welcomed him as the latest figure seeking to encapsulate the particular warmth that exists between the two countries. The message was: no cause for concern. Israelis seemed largely convinced. Whether Americans were remains to be seen.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-24T09:36:00Z", "title": "Jonathan Spyer: Barack Obama's aim in Israel was to show he's a candidate of the centre", "sentences": ["Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum characterised him as seeking to reach the White House &quot;through Tel Aviv&quot;, at &quot;the expense of the Palestinians&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/24/barackobama.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Close your eyes and picture the scene: it is the group stage of the 2018 World Cup and England (it&apos;s an outside bet, but for journalistic purposes let&apos;s just suppose they made it to the finals) follow the same path they always do in international tournaments, a narrow victory against some form of footballing minnow followed by a goalless, soulless draw, probably against Sweden. And then comes the crunch match, in a state of the art stadium near the azure waters of the Mediterranean. In, erm, Gaza City.  No, I haven&apos;t been smoking crack. While England, Australia and the United States gear up for a long bout of sycophancy and arse-kissing to secure the rights to host the 2018 World Cup, a rather more problematic, if noble, potential host is coming up fast on the outside fence: a joint Israel-Palestine bid.  The bid is the brainchild of the Israeli filmmaker Eytan Heller and the international NGO OneVoice. &quot;The original idea came in 2006 during the World Cup when I travelled to Ramallah,&quot; Heller said. &quot;I was amazed to see the flags of all the European teams on the roofs of the city and seeing the same thing in Tel Aviv in my neighbourhood, it seemed like a continuity of fraternity, so I wanted to launch a campaign to launch the candidacy.&quot;  Both host countries would share the matches with Ramallah, Tulkarem and Gaza taking the Palestinian&apos;s share and Haifa, Tel Aviv and Mitzpe Ramon the Israeli games. The final would, of course, be played in Jerusalem. Or Al Quds. Or maybe Jerusalem-Al Quds. Anyway, the aim, according to Heller, is to try and get a critical mass of football fans on either side of the wall, as well as internationally, to support the bid. &quot;It&apos;s a grassroots campaign and the idea is to try and grow organically and stay away from the political heaviness and manipulation of organisations that have links to government and have nationalistic agendas,&quot; he said. &quot;Look at Japan and Korea. They were enemies too and overcame that. Why not here? There are a lot of cynics who laugh at this idea and start to ask very realistic questions. How can we build stadiums? Aren&apos;t the territories too small? You can say the same thing about peace but if you don&apos;t believe in it what is the point in being here?&quot;  The idea has already attracted thousands of supporters who can sign up for a seat in the organisation&apos;s virtual stadium on its website, which also has a short promotional video showing Palestinian footballers joyously kicking a ball over the wall. And there has also been some high profile support. Last February IRIS, a French international relations think tank, released a statement from Lilian Thuram backing the bid. &quot;If a peace agreement is concluded\u2026a 2018 World Cup jointly staged in Israel and Palestine would be a fantastic opportunity to consolidate the gains for both sides,&quot; wrote Thuram along with IRIS&apos;s director Pascal Boniface. &quot;Infrastructure investment would then follow. The joint organisation of the 2018 World Cup in a place where two peoples were once at war would serve as a powerful symbol of the way that sports can serve the cause of peace.&quot; Boniface admitted that &quot;it is impossible to think of the World Cup in the current situation. But look at South Africa. The World Cup is a reward for them ending apartheid. This bid would be the same, a reward for peace and the end of the war. Peace is not there. This is the biggest obstacle. Not an imposed peace, but a real and true peace.&quot;  While the oft abused, and plainly false, maxim of keeping football and politics separate is still spouted by Fifa, those backing the joint 2018 bid think that great things could be achieved if the world governing body took a more politically proactive stance on its bidding selection. Supporters think that the bid could be an incentive for peace in a part of the world obsessed by football, not to mention all the accoutrements that follow it, like the rebuilding of the West Bank and Gaza&apos;s shattered infrastructure.  &quot;Let&apos;s assume that Fifa said &apos;we want to inspire people to sign a framework agreement if you do a, b and c&apos;, then I am sure there would be an enormous amount of media pressure,&quot; said Daniel Lubetzky, founder and president of OneVoice. &quot;It would inspire politicians and inspire people not normally involved. Israelis and Palestinians are huge soccer fans so if there was such a hope it would get the average soccer fan to say &apos;wow, yallah [let&apos;s go]&apos;. It&apos;s one little example of how much better things could be.&quot; So far, so right on. Should England&apos;s footballing burghers, who are themselves planning a bid, start looking over their shoulder? So far the only country to come out in support of the bid is Djibouti and, while every World Cup bid has its unique hurdles, a joint Israel-Palestine bid literally has a huge wall in front of it. The Israeli West Bank barrier is a totemic reminder of a intractable conflict that has incrementally worsened over sixty years. And currently the countries aren&apos;t exactly well prepared to host an international football tournament, what with Israeli road blocks, the threat of terrorism, and non-existent infrastructure. Furthermore, there are no stadiums other than one in Gaza (itself shelled by the Israeli army two years ago while a local team trained on it) and the hopefully named Jericho International Stadium, which resembles something from the Scottish third division. Oh, and then there&apos;s the issue of whether any Arab states would actually turn up to play a tournament in a country they don&apos;t officially recognise. All of which puts the problems surrounding South Africa&apos;s hosting of the 2010 tournament into a bit of perspective.  But the biggest barrier appears to be getting both the Israeli and Palestinian FAs to agree on anything at all. While the Israeli FA is at least conducive to the idea of football being used to heal deep social and political divisions \u2013 they are involved in the yearly Peres Center for Peace football matches where a joint Israel-Palestine team get hammered by the likes of Real Madrid or Barcelona \u2013 they still have reservations about working with their Palestinian counterparts. &quot;We welcome any proposal that helps peace in the Middle East,&quot; said Gil Levanoni, spokesperson for the Israeli FA. &quot;[But] I think that the Israelis and Palestinians have more complicated problems [than hosting a tournament]. It would be the least and last of our problems. The situation is not so simple between Israel and Palestine. We still have a soldier captured in Gaza.&quot;  There&apos;s no love lost on the Palestinian side either. According to the Peres Center for Peace, Palestinian players who participated in any of the peace matches are punished by being dropped from the national team. Certainly when I met Mohammed Sabah, then the Palestinian national coach, during a tournament in Amman, which took place at the same time as the last Peace Match last year, there seemed little chance of footballing reconciliation. &quot;No, I am not sharing [a pitch with] the occupation,&quot; Sabah told me outright when I asked whether he supported the Palestinian presence at the peace matches. &quot;The Israelis must know that when we have our rights we can play. But when we are killed and they make checkpoints ... we can&apos;t play like in other countries.&quot;  But there is some hope. Earlier this year Jibril Rajoub, who is something of Palestinian political institution, was elected president of the Palestinian FA. After spending 15 years in an Israeli jail for throwing a grenade, followed by deportation to Lebanon, Rajoub rose to become Yasser Arafat&apos;s National Security Advisor. As a moderate he was also a leading candidate to replace him as head of the Palestinian Authority when he died.  The job went to Mahmoud Abbas but Rajoub is using his position to spark some footballing d\u00e9tente. One of his first acts as President was to meet Israeli Knesset members about the feasibility of building a joint Israeli Palestinian national stadium over the Green Line.  Still, Heller is realistic that a joint Israel Palestine bid for the World Cup is a long shot, but he believes that even the slimmest of chances is still a chance. &quot;The chances are very small, yes,&quot; Heller admitted. &quot;The campaign is more aimed at lighting a match and sparking a different vision. This is the end result of a long-term vision, but there are prerequisites and preconditions. Hosting the World Cup is a dream, but why not? We should be there when the decision is made [in 2011].&quot;  Brian Barwick, you have been warned.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-24T12:54:32Z", "title": "James Montague on the possibility of a joint bid from Israel and Palestine to host the World Cup", "sentences": ["&quot;I was amazed to see the flags of all the European teams on the roofs of the city and seeing the same thing in Tel Aviv in my neighbourhood, it seemed like a continuity of fraternity, so I wanted to launch a campaign to launch the candidacy.&quot;  Both host countries would share the matches with Ramallah, Tulkarem and Gaza taking the Palestinian&apos;s share and Haifa, Tel Aviv and Mitzpe Ramon the Israeli games."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/24/1"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "US elections 2008", "US news", "World news", "Germany", "US politics", "Europe"], "article": "For the man who has brought rock-star charisma to electoral politics, today saw the campaign rally as pop festival, a summer gathering of peace, love \u2014 and loathing of George Bush. Taking what he calls his &quot;improbable journey&quot; to the heart of Europe, Barack Obama succeeded in closing down one of Berlin&apos;s main thoroughfares tonight, luring the city&apos;s young in their tens of thousands to stand in the evening sunshine and hear him spin his dreams of hope, not for America this time, but for the whole world. The young and the pierced, some with guitars slung over their shoulders, others barefoot, jammed up against each other to cheer on a man who in less than a year has become the world&apos;s most popular serving politician, even if, as yet, he has been elected to no office grander than the junior Senate seat for Illinois. Expectations had been impossibly high, with predictions of a million-strong crowd filling the Strasse des 17 Juni, the wide avenue that links the Brandenburg Gate with the looming, gold-topped Victory column of the Siegess\u00e4ule.  The candidate himself had sought to lower expectations, telling reporters on the plane from Tel Aviv that he doubted he would be greeted in Berlin by &quot;a million screaming Germans&quot;. Once the Glastonbury-style warm-up bands and DJs had quieted, the Democratic nominee almost floated into view, walking to the podium on a raised, blue-carpeted runway, as if he were somehow, magically, walking on water. Even from a distance, the brilliant white of his teeth dazzled. It was a reminder that the latest edition of Stern magazine features Obama on the cover, above the line &quot;Saviour \u2014 or demagogue?&quot; The speech was not one of Obama&apos;s masterpieces, but it certainly cleared the exceptionally high standard he has set himself. Poetically, he reminded Berliners of what they would surely regard as their finest hours, their resilience during the blockade some 60 years ago \u2014 when the Soviet Union tried &quot;to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin&quot; \u2014 and the fall of the wall in 1989, an event which opened the &quot;doors of democracy&quot; all over the world. But the loudest applause came when Obama, however subtly, offered himself as the coming antidote to all that Germans, Europeans, indeed most non-Americans, have disliked about the Bush era. After listing a series of global problems, from genocide in Darfur to loose nukes, he declared: &quot;No one nation, no matter how large or how powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.&quot; It was a promise to end the unilateralism of the early Bush years, and the crowd could not contain their delight.  There was no less warmth when Obama explained his belief in &quot;allies who will listen to each other, who will learn from each other who will, above all, trust each other&quot;. Again and again he uttered sentences that could never have come from the mouth of George W Bush, and Berlin could not have been more grateful. &quot;This is the moment to secure the peace of the world without nuclear weapons,&quot; he said. On Iraq, the aim was &quot;to finally bring this war to a close&quot;. He asked if today&apos;s generation was ready to seize the moment that was at hand. &quot;Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law?&quot; he asked. &quot;Will we welcome immigrants from different lands?&quot;  As for the threat of climate change, he spoke in language that could not have been more sweeping or more epic: &quot;This is the moment we must come together to save this planet.&quot; (Was that saviour or demagogue \u2014 or both?) He didn&apos;t spell out that he would reverse much of the course of the last eight years, but that was only because he didn&apos;t have to. &quot;This is an anti-Bush rally,&quot; said one man, an employee of the German government, reluctant to reveal his name because of his job.  The last time he had seen such a crowd in the same place was for the Love Parade music festival, &quot;and you can see the similarities&quot;, he said. There was only one dissonant note, but Obama&apos;s mood music covered it nicely.  Invoking the spirit of the airlift of 1948, he called for there to be more &quot;sharing the burden&quot; between Germany and America, code for his request for Germany to send more troops for the Nato mission to Afghanistan. &quot;We have too much at stake to turn back now.&quot; Germany&apos;s politicians had given their response to that earlier in the day, with Chancellor Angela Merkel telling the candidate there were &quot;limits&quot; on how many troops Germany would send. The move came after the German cabinet had voted to increase the number of troops from 1,000 to 4,500. Overall, though, the mood was warm, even joyful, a sign perhaps of just how deep the yearning outside the US is to end the current era \u2014 and to have an America non-Americans can believe in again. Andreas Wernicke, 27, a computer salesman, said the idea of an African-American US president was &quot;just totally cool&quot;, if it happened, he said, &quot;you could tell yourself that, yes, the world does advance&quot;. By common consent, tonight and the entire Obama week has been a huge success, generating priceless images for TV consumption back home and helping Obama cross the credibility gap \u2014 making it easier for Americans to imagine him as a player on the world stage.  The Obama camp is hoping the notion that the US will regain the respect of the world under a President Obama will persuade many American voters to back him. Tonight&apos;s pictures from Berlin will have further discomforted Obama&apos;s Republican opponent, John McCain, who has struggled for media oxygen during a week of near-constant coverage of the Democrat&apos;s grand tour.  He complained on Fox News yesterday that he was barely getting a look in. &quot;All I can do is be amused,&quot; he said manfully.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-24T20:16:28Z", "title": "US elections: Obama wows Berlin crowd with historic speech", "sentences": ["The candidate himself had sought to lower expectations, telling reporters on the plane from Tel Aviv that he doubted he would be greeted in Berlin by &quot;a million screaming Germans&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/jul/24/barackobama.uselections2008"}, {"tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "I laughed at his pompous declaration that &quot;the British government will stand full-square against any boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics and their institutions.&quot; After all, the University and College Union has not yet voted for a boycott: merely that &quot;colleagues be asked to consider the moral and political implications of educational links with Israeli institutions&quot;. This modest call to conscience has induced apoplexy in both the British and Israeli cabinets. Clearly we have struck a raw nerve. I also laughed, rather bitterly, at Brown&apos;s inability to perceive his own ironies. For instance, his reference to 1948 as the year when &quot;the centuries of exile ended&quot;, whereas for thousands of Palestinians it was the year when exile began; or his pledge to &quot;show those who would give licence to terror... that the path to a better future runs not through violence, not by murder, and never with the killing of civilians.&quot; Coming from one failing prime minister with blood on his hands to another, this was a bit rich.

When he said &quot;the people of Israel have a right to live here, to live freely and to live in security&quot;, which people of Israel did he mean? Did he include the Arab citizens of villages like Dar El-Hanoun, whose roads and playground were demolished by the Ministry of the Interior because the village was &quot;unrecognised&quot;? Brown drew attention to Israeli achievements in medicine, academia, the arts, sport, music, science and technology. BRICUP is currently campaigning for boycotts in each of these spheres. The Israeli Medical Association is a pariah because it fails to investigate allegations that its members condone torture during interrogation. The Israeli football team gets picketed because Israel has repeatedly prevented the Palestinian team from travelling and has destroyed Palestinian football pitches. Musicians, artists and writers intending to appear in Israel are being urged to treat Tel Aviv like Sun City in the days of South African apartheid. Architects are called on to stop underpinning the occupation. Scientists and academics are challenged about their institutions&apos; complicity with the military establishment. So when Brown announced grants for joint initiatives through the Britain-Israel Research and Academic Exchange Partnership, BRICUP urged British and Israeli academics of conscience not to participate. This is an attempt to continue &quot;business as usual&quot; and we should have no part in it.

The myth of Kafka&apos;s life so overshadows what he wrote that millions who have never read a word of his know, or think they know, something about the middle-European Nostradamus, almost unknown in his own lifetime, trapped in a dead-end job, whose mysterious, endlessly interpretable works somehow foresaw the Holocaust (and so on). In 1982 I was allowed, as a mere undergraduate, to touch the original manuscript of The Castle. Throughout the 10 years I spent doing a PhD on Kafka, I was haunted by the memory of that simple historical artefact and by the vague but growing conviction that there is something rotten in the state of the Kafka industry.  While writing my book Excavating Kafka I came across unpublished material so striking as to suggest that the myth needs completely demolishing. If the mere prospect of a few new letters throwing light on his relationship with Max Brod is enough to send scholars all over the world into raptures, why has no one has ever thought fit to show Kafka&apos;s readers and students the pornography he owned?  There is a footnote in Brod&apos;s first biography of Kafka, which would have enabled anyone to find this material 85 years ago. His letters to Brod reveal, to those with eyes to see, exactly where he kept the porn - in a locked bookcase in his parents&apos; house (an image that sets off echoes throughout his work). The mystery is why it has remained such a secret. The underlying reason is, I suspect, that admitting to Kafka&apos;s porn also unlocks the truth about his whole literary life.  The man who delivered porn to Kafka in 1906-07 turns out to be the same man who first published him in 1908 - and who, as judge of Berlin&apos;s major literary prize, fixed things so that Kafka would get the glory. It seems the Kafka industry doesn&apos;t want to know such things about its idol - which means, academics being the gatekeepers of the artefacts, that they don&apos;t want you, the reader, to know.  Once we realise this, the light of historical reality floods in through the holes in the hagiographic myth. We find a millionaire&apos;s son addicted to whores all his adult life; a writer backed by an influential clique who was admired (and knew it) by almost every major German-language fellow-author of his day; a loyal Habsburg citizen with a senior state-sector job who expected (and wanted) the German and Austrian empires to win the first world war, right to the end; a man who had no more inkling of the Holocaust than anyone else.  With the rubble cleared away, perhaps we&apos;ll at last see Kafka&apos;s work for what it really is - not the gloomy stuff we Anglo-Saxons received via post-Auschwitz French existentialists, but wonderful black comedies written by a man soaked in the writings of his predecessors and of his own day.James Hawes \u00b7 Last week&apos;s Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing festival at Harrogate is not only the biggest festival of its kind in Europe, it is also the most convivial of all literary festivals - with authors and readers mixing happily, especially in the bar. Hotly debated topics, both on and off stage, included why women get so much flak for writing violent books (answer: prejudice), why people are sniffy about &quot;cosy crime&quot; (same reason - as Catriona McPherson, author of gentle 1920s mysteries put it: &quot;All that these hard men are doing is sitting in a chair typing, just like me, you know&quot;), and whether Andy McNab would be interviewed wearing a balaclava (he didn&apos;t, although, for security reasons, he cannot allow himself to be photographed). Stef Penney (right), the only woman on the shortlist for the prize for best crime novel, proved a worthy and popular winner for her first novel, The Tenderness of Wolves Quercus). She won \u00a33,000 and a hand-made beer cask.Laura Wilson \u00b7 Which author has, over a 50-year career, been described as &quot;beyond psychiatric help&quot;, seen his work banned, refused a CBE, spawned his own adjective and been immortalised on a stamp? If you guessed right, you&apos;ll be able to say with the aficionados gathered in Barcelona this week: &quot;Soy ballardiano.&quot; &quot;Autopsy of the New Millennium&quot; is a four-month exhibition dedicated to the work of JG Ballard, conducted in Spanish, Catalan and English at the Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (see www.cccb.org). That it should appear in a city better known for Gaud\u00ed and scooters than sliproads and suburbia is a sign of Ballard&apos;s growing international stature. As well as long-lost films and interviews, the curators have assembled an exhaustive array of Ballardiana, from his cut-up texts and provocative fake adverts to the short story &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan&quot; in the shape of a political pamphlet distributed at the Republican convention, and a damning review of Ballard&apos;s 1970 art installation of crashed cars by the woman hired to provide scantily clad decoration at its launch. Other perspectives are provided by an internee&apos;s incongruously gentle watercolours of the Shanghai camp, and video and photos by artists who identify themselves as Ballardian. The exhibition was launched to the strains of Ballardian music - Klaxons, Robert Foxx - and there was much talk of the Ballardian gaze, described as a set of reading glasses which can throw the inner workings of reality into focus or merely show a blur. &quot;It&apos;s like Christian grace,&quot; says Josep Ramoneda, the CCCB director. &quot;You either have it or you don&apos;t.&quot; Justine Jordan \u00b7 Second-guessing the Man Booker judges&apos; longlist choices ahead of Tuesday&apos;s announcement has taken off this year, on both the prize&apos;s own site and Picador&apos;s blog - where \u00a350-worth of Picador books are on offer to the person with &quot;most correct guesses&quot;. On the Booker site, one blogger tallied up scores in the guess lists, ranking authors by number of mentions as follows: Tim Winton (11); Alexis Wright (9); Andrew Crumey, Damon Galgut, James Kelman, Salman Rushdie (all 8); Peter Carey (7); John Burnside (6); Steve Toltz, Mohammed Hanif, Poppy Adams, Sadie Jones, Zo\u00eb Heller, Aravind Adiga (all 5); Howard Jacobson, Ross Raisin, Helen Garner, Nadeem Aslam, Sebastian Barry (all 4); Joe Dunthorne, Joseph O&apos;Neill, Helen Walsh (all 3); David Park, Elizabeth Lowry, Patrick McGrath, Michelle de Kretser, Amitav Ghosh, David Lodge, Philip Hensher, Stephen Galloway (all 2).

They plan, plot and puzzle, as embattled military establishments always do. Yet the most important decisions are arguably those that face the army least often mentioned in discussion - that of Pakistan.  For the Pakistani army has to decide how to save itself and the country it has dominated for so long. In the struggle across the region, it could even be said that decisions made in Rawalpindi, the army&apos;s headquarters, may turn out to be more important than those made in Washington, Baghdad, Tehran or Tel Aviv. And this army is highly autonomous. It has frequently been the government, and remains by far the most powerful institution in the country.  The regional war on whose name nobody can agree - terror, occupation, invasion - has shifted its shape in recent years. In western eyes, anyway, it was in the beginning about Afghanistan, then Iraq was its epicentre, until the focus shifted to Iran and its nuclear ambitions, and then back to Afghanistan. Pakistan always figured when Afghanistan was in the spotlight because failure to deal effectively with the Taliban and al-Qaida in the border areas puts Nato forces at a disadvantage. Pakistan was seen as a dimension of the Afghan problem, and was again presented in those terms yesterday when the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Galani, assured George Bush in Washington that Pakistan would strive to secure the Afghan border.  Now you could put it the other way round. As insurgents have moved from the border strip to some settled areas of Pakistan in recent months, it is at least an open question as to which country is the sideshow and which the main event. Without demonising these movements - which mix tribalism, jihadism, Pashtun national feeling and criminality, and are also the product of social breakdown resulting from decades of war - it cannot be right that parts of Pakistan are ruled by parallel governments, judged by parallel courts, and make war on their own terms whenever they wish. Militants are even now encroaching on the environs of Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province. In Mohmand, the Taliban controls economic enterprises. The number of foreign fighters entering Pakistan is said to be now much higher than those entering Iraq. And they are coming to Pakistan not only to fight in Afghanistan, but in Pakistan itself.  The Pakistani army, however, is still following a strategy of negotiations and ceasefires, punctuated by well-signalled and often bloodless sweeps by the local Frontier Corps. True, this is also the policy of the new national government and of the Peshawar provincial government. It is also true that heavy-handed military operations are not the best counter to insurgency. But in the army&apos;s case, the softly, softly approach has been shaped by the defeats and setbacks it suffered in earlier efforts to deal with insurgents and by its own involvement in backing extremist movements. Such movements were useful tools in the confrontation with India in Kashmir, and in influencing events in Afghanistan.  It is less a question of the army&apos;s tactical choices than of whether it still cannot give up the idea of &quot;keeping&quot; the militant movements as a card in future conflicts. But the militants are out of control. They tried to kill Parvez Musharraf, they probably killed Benazir Bhutto, they have bombed army offices and even the headquarters of Inter-Services Intelligence. The attempt to outwit India, the rationale of the Pakistani armed forces since independence, is outdated. As Ahmed Rashid says in his book on the regional crisis, Descent into Chaos: &quot;The army&apos;s insecurity ... has now come full circle, for Pakistan&apos;s very future is at stake as extremists threaten to undermine Pakistan itself.&quot;  That threat comes at a time when Pakistan is otherwise in a process of renewal, as evidenced by the success of liberal and secular candidates in recent elections. An expanding urban middle class wants a new kind of country, and feudal and tribal dominance in rural areas is fading. Overprivileged and muddle-headed, the army needs to follow suit. If it does so, the moment of opportunity for extremism in Pakistan will be brief - and that could have a transforming effect on the rest of the region. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-07-29T23:01:00Z", "title": "Martin Woollacott: National insecurity in Pakistan", "sentences": ["In the struggle across the region, it could even be said that decisions made in Rawalpindi, the army&apos;s headquarters, may turn out to be more important than those made in Washington, Baghdad, Tehran or Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/30/pakistan"}, {"tags": ["William Boyd", "Original writing", "Books"], "article": "I stole a BOAC Speedbird lapel badge from my friend Mark Pertwee. I was eight years old and it was the first act of conscious larceny that I can remember. BOAC - British Overseas Airways Corporation - that dates me; and the &quot;Speedbird&quot; logo is now long gone, also. I can see the small badge in my mind&apos;s eye: a 10-pence piece would cover it - navy blue, edged with silver, a cross between a notional bird-shape and an arrowhead - modern, thrusting, stylish, everything that the 1960s, BOAC and its fleet of mighty, navy blue and white, four-engined, turboprop planes were meant to embody...  Mark Pertwee&apos;s mother was a travel agent and she was a source of all manner of travel agent freebies: timetables, small desktop models of planes (KLM, Pan Am, Air France), little plastic pennants of national flags and their carriers, and she generously shared this bounty with me as well as her son (I was his best friend), but she pointedly did not give me a Speedbird lapel badge. Perhaps she was only provided with one, herself, perhaps it was valuable - silver plate and enamel - it now strikes me. And perhaps this was why I coveted it so.  I planned my theft well. First of all, I hid it in the Pertwee house, in the cupboard under the sink in the guest toilet. I waited a fortnight (Mark seemed oblivious to its disappearance) before I pocketed it one day and took it home. I never showed it to my parents or my three older sisters - indeed I never wore the Speedbird lapel badge in my lapel. It was, in a way, a pointless theft - Mark Pertwee never knew he had lost it and I was never able to sport it. Was it, even, a bona fide theft, worthy of the name, given it had never been registered as stolen in the theft-victim&apos;s mind? I think I lost it in one of my parents&apos; many house moves. I wonder why I stole it at all.  I stole cigarettes from my mother - never money, I want to make that absolutely clear. She smoked heavily, two packs a day, and favoured a brand called Peter Stuyvesant, a cigarette with a somewhat astringent, throat-warming taste, as I recall (and much enjoyed by raffish, square-jawed, Caucasian airline pilots, if the advertisements were to be believed). I would steal four or five cigarettes a week, and she never spotted they had gone.  I ask myself again: is this an example of another non-theft? What category of genuine theft have we here? In my teens, I must have stolen hundreds, possibly thousands, of cigarettes from her. She would buy cigarettes in cartons and, as I grew more bold, I would steal entire packs from the drawer in her bedroom where she kept her stash. My father was a pipe-smoker, with a penchant for fragrant, aromatic tobaccos (until he died in his 50s from lung cancer). Our house reeked of smoke, like a pub. I smoked in my bedroom and no one noticed; my three sisters smoked. It was like that in those days.  I smoked regularly through my teens, even after my father died, and only gave up when I married my first wife, Encarnacion. She detested smoke and smokers to a neurotic degree - I would not have managed a kiss had I not forsworn cigarettes. I think back to all that subterfuge - opening my mother&apos;s handbag, rifling through its contents looking for the Peter Stuyvesant soft-pack, checking to see how many were left - always risky to steal if there were under 10. Then a few heart-thumping seconds watching her fish in her bag to light up herself, and, later, the furtive, head-reeling inhalation with my friends down the lane, under the railway bridge; the subsequent needless deodorising of the mouth - chewing gum, Listerine - and clothes and body (Brut aftershave was particularly masking). For years I must have walked through my house leaving in my wake a pungent, invisible contrail of chemical perfume. Nobody noticed, ever.  I stole food at my boarding school. We were allowed a modest food parcel once a week (like POWs) from a local grocer: a few bananas, a box of dates, mini-packs of cornflakes - no buns or cakes, no chocolates, nothing that could be purchased from the school tuck shop where fizzy drinks, colas, biscuits and every tooth-rotting sweet the confectionery industry could serve up were on offer.  In my house there was a very rich Greek boy whose food parcel might have come from Fortnum &amp; Mason, such was its size and magnificence. I and my coevals pillaged this boy&apos;s food with no compunction (he was plump and cried easily). It was thanks to Stavros&apos;s food parcel that I developed my enduring taste for Patum Peperium, Gentleman&apos;s Relish, a dark, pesto-like spread made from anchovies. It is my Proustian madeleine - it summons up all my early pilfering. I can taste its earthy, farinaceous salinity now.  I stole other things, as well - everyone stole at my school - it was tacitly understood that we all stole from each other, all the time. We stole food, drink, deodorant, shampoo, clothes, pornography, pens, stationery, books... We also shoplifted shamelessly and efficiently in the local town and villages. Only stealing money from your schoolmates was the ultimate sin, which brought permanent pariah-status on the perpetrator and earned him, for the duration of his school career, the nickname of &quot;Fingers&quot; - his personal badge of iniquity, his mark of Cain.  I stole a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses from a department store in Bath where I was at university doing a degree in architecture. I tried them on, then tried on a dozen others, replacing some back on their little racks, taking them off again and, halfway through this elaborate process, putting on my own spectacles and slipping the Ray-Bans into my spectacle case. I wore them all summer to much acclaim. I was probably wearing them when I met Encarnacion (my future wife, the one who hated smoking) who was an au pair for a solicitor&apos;s family in Bristol.  I look back on my university years as my thieving pomp. I stole at will, whenever I felt like it. Nothing grand, nothing exceptional, just things I wanted and didn&apos;t feel like paying for. I stole newspapers and magazines (the New Statesman, Mayfair, Men Only, Flight, Gramophone); I stole hardback books (I still remember some titles: The History Man, Keats And Embarrassment, The Metropolitan Critic); I stole food - Mars bars, sandwiches, fruit. I once stole a haunch of venison from a delicatessen. One day I stole a tin of cherry pie-filling - I&apos;ve no idea why: I don&apos;t particularly like cherries and had no intention of making a pie. The man who ran the corner shop, where I casually lifted the tin from a shelf on my way out, saw me and gave chase. I lost him after a couple of streets - I ran fast - but I have never since experienced such a pure rush of emotion: an atavistic fear followed by an adrenaline-fuelled exhilaration that made me sway as I stood there catching my breath.  I stole nothing for several years - I simply stopped stealing for a while. Perhaps it was marriage to Encarnacion, the swift arrival of the twins (Lolita and Bonita) and the responsibilities that went with my job. I was an architect in a large and prestigious firm - the Freedlander, Cobb Partnership - I was a married man and a father of two lovely little girls. Stealing in these circumstances would seem demeaning, despoiling, almost filthy. All right, like everyone else I fiddled my expenses, but no one in their right mind would call that theft. However, it was over a fractious and unpleasant formal query about my expenses that I met the managing partner of Freedlander, Cobb - Margaret Warburton, FCA, and my life changed.  I stole my daughters&apos; happiness. Perhaps that&apos;s too strong: I stole Lolita and Bonita&apos;s right to a stable family life with two parents, a father and a mother. To this day I don&apos;t know how Encarnacion discovered my affair with Margaret Warburton, but when she presented the evidence of our liaison (her father, Jose, and her brother, Severiano, also sternly present, their dark eyes shining with implacable loathing), it was compendious and irrefutable. We separated, she took the girls back to Valladolid, we divorced and I moved in with Margaret.  I missed the girls but I did not miss Encarnacion much, I have to confess. There is a problem marrying someone who speaks your own language imperfectly - all nuance is lost: and with nuance goes humour, irony, sarcasm, subtext, secrets. All these were present with Margaret - a clever, sly and salacious mind operated beneath that perfect accountant&apos;s exterior: the lean, pale, expressionless face, the deliberately too-tight, well-cut suits, the coiffed, dark helmet of hair, the black-framed officious spectacles - swiftly removed and swiftly replaced to make forensic points in meetings. Indeed, it was exactly this juxtaposition that made my adulterous sex life with her so energetic and alluring. I didn&apos;t take enough care - I didn&apos;t take any care, I now realise; all I wanted and waited for was the covert rendezvous, the snatched weekend, the airport hotel, the meeting of two cars, nose to nose, in some rural layby.  I stole pounds 985,622 from Freedlander, Cobb over a period of seven years. Margaret Warburton, the managing partner, supervising the burgeoning accounts of the firm, saw the opportunity, especially as more and more of our projects were abroad - the desalination plant in Saudi Arabia, the new terminal at Kolkata airport, three office blocks in Shanghai, and so on. She needed a senior partner to collude - and why wouldn&apos;t I collude with my clever wife? (We married shortly after the divorce, but told no one, not even my mother and sisters - Margaret&apos;s idea.) I signed wherever she told me - overruns, unforeseen expenses, delays, extra hours worked because of global time differences - the opportunities were manifold. In a $100m contract, do you notice an extra $80,000? No, not if it&apos;s all properly accounted. We were careful, we took our time, we weren&apos;t greedy. Small amounts on almost every job were hived off and banked in the Cayman Islands. Sometimes we deliberately admitted to our mistakes, apologised and reimbursed the client. Everything appeared above board. We lived well, holidayed discreetly but at considerable expense (Margaret bought us a permanent suite on one of those floating cruise-ship hotels) and we maintained separate houses for form&apos;s sake. When we were arrested together, in Margaret&apos;s office in the new Freedlander, Cobb HQ in Southwark - the one that looks like a hand grenade - it came as a massive shock. I felt like an innocent man, wrongly arraigned on a trumped-up charge.  I stole tobacco from my fellow prisoners in the austere but not intolerable open prison where I was sent to pay my debt to society for my shameful white-collar crime. For some reason, I received a sentence of six years and Margaret three. Tobacco, cigarettes - is this the thieving leitmotif in my life? I stole tobacco - I&apos;d given up smoking years before, remember - to buy alcohol. Prisoners who worked in the allotments made a virulently potent hooch from potatoes and other tubers. I would pinch fingerfuls of roll-up tobacco from casually set-down plastic envelopes of the stuff, and when I had enough accumulated (a fistful, say) would exchange it for half a pint of moonshine and a few hours of oblivion. It was like drinking some sort of burning, ruthless, liquid toxin; you sensed small ulcers forming in your stomach almost immediately. You felt it could have de-iced aeroplanes in the Arctic, stripped paint from antique cars. It was marvellously strong. My drink problem became more acute after Margaret left prison and divorced me. She moved abroad, to Latin America, and I never heard from her again, of course. How much had we really stolen? I had no idea. The prosecuting council came up with the pounds 985,622 figure, but for all I know it could have been double. It was entirely Margaret&apos;s plan, the whole operation - she was the thief, the real thief, not me. Old Julius Freedlander himself took the stand to destroy my character, claiming only to be &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; with Margaret&apos;s betrayal. She was demure, only rarely weepy - I think I seemed some brutal mastermind who had dumped his nice Spanish wife to manipulate this blameless accountant. Both Margaret and I were advised by our briefs to plead guilty, advice we took - it seemed to work for her.  I stole three and a half pints of bitter, a near-full gin and tonic and a Bacardi Breezer in the Richard The Lionheart in Cromer, Norfolk, last night. It&apos;s laughably easy - a legacy of my prison-induced alcoholism. I steal drinks in crowded pubs at weekends or, better still, pubs with beer gardens in the summer. I sit nursing my bitter lemon or Diet Coke waiting for the bar staff to emerge and start clearing up empty glasses. I just follow them around, and in the bustle that their progress creates more often than not can help myself to an unguarded drink, take it as far away as possible and consume it quickly. Crowds of young men and women, always leaving their drinks to go out and smoke, are very fair game. You&apos;ll see five or six glasses on a ledge or table - nobody knows whose drink it is, nobody pays attention. Solitary drinkers who leave their drink to go to the lavatory are also useful prey. It&apos;s amazing how many people buy a pint or a glass of wine, and leave without finishing them. I discreetly help myself to these unwanted drinks - but then again that&apos;s not stealing. If you read a discarded newspaper on the train, have you stolen it? Of course not.  To go into prison a successful, highly-trained, middle-class professional and emerge a semi-functioning alcoholic was hardly what I planned and naturally, after the disgrace, the profession no longer allowed me to call myself &quot;Architect&quot;. I managed to buy a small cottage in South Runton, near Cromer, and set myself up as a &quot;Designer&quot;. In the first years I was commissioned to do a few jobs - a cricket pavilion, a conservatory in a nursery, a wing of a doctors&apos; clinic in King&apos;s Lynn, and managed to live quietly, respectably. But the jobs seemed slowly but steadily to diminish - I wonder if word had leaked out somehow about the Freedlander, Cobb scandal. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Julius Freedlander himself wasn&apos;t quietly blackening my name around East Anglia... In any event I haven&apos;t worked in 18 months and I&apos;m seriously behind on my mortgage repayments. I recently sold my car and bought a bicycle.  My great pleasure, apart from drinking, are my daughters, Lolita and Bonita - rather, I should say &quot;Lola y Bona&quot;. They are a pop sensation in Spain and other Mediterranean countries - Greece, Croatia, Cyprus. They have a website: lolaybona.es - check it out, their fame is local but huge. I cycle into Cromer once a week and buy all the foreign celebrity magazines, you know the ones - Calor!, Proximite, Peep&apos;L. I cut out the pictures of Lola y Bona and stick them on a huge pinboard that covers one wall in my kitchen. My wall of celebration, I call it, at least something turned out well.  Last week I took my pile of magazines into the Lionheart and flicked through them looking for pictures of my babies. I found a couple of them at a film festival in Dubrovnik. Tanned, lithe, sexy girls with black, black hair, like their mother. Identical twins, that&apos;s the catch, you see - the songs they sing seem entirely ordinary, bouncy, rhythmic, heavy on percussion, thumping drums - but those girls, 18 years old, impossible to tell them apart.  A man I vaguely know wondered if I&apos;d like a drink, so I asked for a large vodka and tonic. I think he&apos;s a novelist, very curious about my stint in the open prison. I tell him colourful anecdotes about &quot;doing time&quot; - I suspect it&apos;s all going into a book. After he&apos;d gone I procured a couple of half pints and most of a large glass of red wine. I wandered out on to the front. I like Cromer, perched on the edge of England, on the edge of England&apos;s plump, round bum. I think of continental Europe out there, across the North Sea, and wonder where Lola y Bona might be: Majorca, Zagreb, Larnaca, Tel Aviv? It makes me feel I&apos;m not that far away from them - not close, but not far away.  There&apos;s a large bric-a-brac antique shop in a side street by the pier and I wandered in to kill some time. I was stunned to see, in a small display of badges and brooches pinned on a velvet cushion, a BOAC Speedbird lapel badge. I asked to have a look at it and inquired about the price. The owner - he has mutton-chop whiskers and wears loud checked suits and coloured waistcoats - told me it was pounds 150. There was no price ticket, of course - what kind of fool did he take me for? &quot;Very rare,&quot; he added, &quot;extremely.&quot; I asked him his best price and he said he couldn&apos;t go lower than 130. I laughed, I scoffed - I told him I&apos;d had one of those BOAC Speedbird lapel badges when I was a boy. Should have hung on to it, mate, he said, smugly: very rare, much sought after by collectors of airline memorabilia. I said I&apos;d think about it and then stuck the badge back on the cushion but was careful not to fully close the securing pin. I&apos;ll come back next weekend - it&apos;s a bank holiday - wander around the shop when he&apos;s distracted by the crowd - and steal it.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T22:59:40Z", "title": "William Boyd: The Things I Stole", "sentences": ["I think of continental Europe out there, across the North Sea, and wonder where Lola y Bona might be: Majorca, Zagreb, Larnaca, Tel Aviv?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/02/william.boyd.short.story"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "Binyamin &quot;Bibi&quot; Netanyahu was with his sons at a football match on Wednesday night when a tearful Ehud Olmert announced he would be stepping down as leader of his Kadima party after months of battling corruption allegations. But his mind may have wandered: for whatever happens next, Netanyahu - once the enfant terrible of Israeli politics and one of its most fascinating and controversial figures - stands to gain. As the implications sink in of Olmert&apos;s decision - for Israel, the Palestinians and the wider Middle East - opinion polls show that the leader of the right-wing Likud opposition remains the Israeli public&apos;s preferred choice as prime minister. &quot;Bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections,&quot; predicts the journalist Haim Baram, combining &quot;gut feeling&quot; with decades of writing about Israel&apos;s febrile, fragmented political life. And given that this is a part of the world where worst-case scenarios tend to come true, the looming crisis over Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions could galvanise squabbling politicians to close ranks and go for a grand national unity coalition: cue Netanyahu.  No wonder his immediate response was to call for early elections - the instinct of a quick-witted politician who seizes on disarray in the enemy camp and senses that his time come. &quot;This government has reached an end and it doesn&apos;t matter who heads Kadima. They are all partners in this government&apos;s total failure,&quot; he declared on Thursday. &quot;If Bibi sees he can precipitate elections, he will,&quot; says the political analyst Yossi Alpher. &quot;But it&apos;s impossible to predict what&apos;s going to happen. There are too many variables.&quot; Two surveys published yesterday forecast a Likud victory over Kadima, though Netanyahu would have a tougher time if the current foreign minister and aspiring Kadima leader, Tzipi Livni, beats her rival, the hawkish Shaul Mofaz. Ehud Barak, the Labour party leader and defence minister, is languishing with just 12%.  Uzi Arad, a former Mossad executive who advises Netanyahu on foreign and security policy, talks too of &quot;imponderables and uncertainties&quot;. But Netanyahu, he argues, &quot;has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions - precisely what Livni lacks&quot;. The Likud leader is a &quot;sober, hard-nosed realist&quot; who has consistently opposed the current Annapolis peace talks with the Palestinians and insists on retaining Jewish settlements all over &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; (the biblical Hebrew names for the West Bank) - a position that is simply not compatible with creating a viable Palestinian state. Hardline views Netanyahu&apos;s hardline views on the Palestinians have barely changed since he first entered public life in the early 1980s. In 1996, when he became the country&apos;s youngest prime minister (and the first who was born after the state was created in 1948) he vowed to chip away at the Oslo accords, which were agreed between Yizthak Rabin and Yasser Arafat and broke Israel&apos;s historic taboo on dealing with the PLO. It was Rabin&apos;s murder by a Jewish extremist, the fatal indecision of the Labour veteran Shimon Peres and a devastating series of Hamas and Islamic Jihad suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that swept the Likud to power. Few of those who dealt with Netanyahu the prime minister have warm memories of him. &quot;Who the fuck does he think he is, who&apos;s the fucking superpower here?&quot; an outraged Bill Clinton asked his aides after his first meeting with the new Israeli leader. A former diplomat remembers him as being &quot;bumptious and over-confident&quot; when he snubbed Robin Cook, Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, after a high-profile visit to the site of a Jewish settlement being planned in Arab East Jerusalem.  In 1997 Netanyahu did reluctantly agree to withdraw from the West Bank city of Hebron (though an enclave of fanatical Jewish settlers remain there, over a decade later), but generally he was seen &quot;as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace,&quot; recalled Clinton&apos;s adviser Aaron David Miller. For Marwan Muasher, Jordan&apos;s ambassador to Israel, Netanyahu&apos;s most striking quality was arrogance coupled with an alarming tendency to spout the old Likud idea that Jordan should oppose Palestinian independence. And the premier got into deep water when Mossad agents tried and failed to assassinate the Hamas leader Khaled Meshal in Amman by injecting poison into his ear. King Hussein threatened to storm the Israeli embassy unless Netanyahu backed down and supplied the antidote to save the Palestinan&apos;s life. Yet like him or loathe him, Netanyahu has always been a slick communicator. The onetime furniture salesman performed well - in fluent American English - as Israel&apos;s ambassador to the UN and spoke for his country during the 1991 Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein&apos;s Scud missiles hit Israel. He once donned a gas mask on screen - a brilliant piece of showmanship. Muasher thought him a &quot;savvy politician, mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it. He tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors, often by stretching or hiding part of the truth.&quot; Interestingly, Netanyahu gets on well with Tony Blair, now the Quartet envoy working on Palestinian economic development. &quot;Netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick, tangible progress, create more jobs and generate growth,&quot; said Arad. &quot;That may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations&quot;. But what there is to negotiate about is less than clear. Netanyahu resigned over Ariel Sharon&apos;s 2005 unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. And he is sharply focused on Jerusalem&apos;s Temple Mount - &quot;the most explosive square kilometre on earth,&quot; and the danger that the city &quot;will become a Mecca for the world&apos;s terrorists&quot;. Iran Terrorism has been an obsession ever since his older brother, Yoni, was killed leading Israeli commandos to free hostages at Uganda&apos;s Entebbe Airport in 1976. Netanyahu claims to have predicted the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and has been quoted as saying that 9/11 was &quot;good for Israel&quot;. He sees Iran as the major problem facing Israel and the world today. &quot;It&apos;s 1938,&quot; he told CNN last year, &quot;and Iran is Germany&quot;. Hamas, and Hizbullah in Lebanon, he argues, are Iranian &quot;proxies&quot;. And until the Islamic Republic is contained, there can be no progress with the Palestinians. Haim Baram, a trenchant critic from the left, agrees that a possible Israeli attack on Iran is the big question. &quot;But Bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than Mofaz or Barak,&quot; he suggests. Netanyahu, famously described as &quot;the senator for Israel,&quot; has met both Barack Obama and John McCain, though his popularity in the US is on the Republican right and with Christian groups that automatically back Israel, right or wrong.  During a stint as finance minister under Sharon, he won both plaudits and brickbats for pushing through Thatcherite-style market reforms that boosted growth - and inequality. But it is on the enduring core issues of war, peace, borders and territory that he will be judged by voters when the time comes. &quot;Israelis have lost faith in peace,&quot; says Ha&apos;aretz commentator Tom Segev. &quot;They don&apos;t believe in it any more.

I love them all dearly and we get on extremely well. But this time we were travelling to Israel for the purpose of attending the arranged marriage of a 17-year-old relative. What makes it worse, Israel is a country both Harriet and I have boycotted for nearly two decades, despite the fact that Harriet&apos;s brother and his wife and children live there. The bride-to-be is Harriet&apos;s niece, Hadara. The groom is a 19-year-old yeshiva [religious] student, Akim, Hadara has met only four times and with whom she has never been alone. Harriet and I are radical feminists, opposed to traditional marriage let alone one arranged by the fathers of the two young people involved. Harriet&apos;s parents, Enid and Ernest Wistrich, are secular and deeply critical of the state of Israel.  Harriet&apos;s younger brother Daniel, the father of the bride, became a religious fundamentalist 15 years ago, much to the distress of his sister and parents. &quot;When Daniel first told me he had become Hassidic,&quot; says Ernest, &quot;I used to wake up in the morning groaning and holding my head in my hands.&quot;  Hassidic men will not touch or even shake hands with any females other than their wife, mother, sister, or daughter. In extreme cases, they will not even look women in the eye. During an evening at Daniel&apos;s home during the trip to Israel, I ask him his opinion on this. &quot;There are some men who can look at a mountain and see a woman,&quot; he said, &quot;and men who look at a woman and see a mountain.&quot; Yes, but why should women be covered up and avoided so that men won&apos;t be tempted? &quot;It is not respectful to the woman to be looked at in that way,&quot; said Daniel, not answering the question.  When Daniel became religious, his mother, accepting the state of affairs reluctantly, had two conditions. &quot;I told him, do not cut off from your family,&quot; says Enid, &quot;and never turn your face away from me or refuse to kiss me.&quot;  Ernest and Enid had three children, but the eldest, Matthew, who was disabled, died aged 14 in 1971. Harriet came next, then Daniel. The Wistrich children grew up in a fairly typical liberal, upper-middle-class household. They lived in Hampstead, north-west London, and were involved in the Woodcraft Folk, the political, peace-loving version of the Brownies or Scouts.  Although Daniel and Harriet have had their run-ins, they have a genuine affection for each other. When Daniel comes to our home for dinner, he is the perfect guest. As he is strictly kosher, Daniel is not allowed to eat or drink anything prepared by us so he brings a takeaway from a kosher Chinese, wine and his own disposable coffee-making gadgets. Their father, Ernest, grew up in a well-off, assimilationist family in pre-war Poland, which looked on its large Hassidic community as &quot;backward&quot;. He came to England shortly before the second world war and caught the last train through Poland before the Nazis invaded. Ernest&apos;s mother and sister survived the war by assuming false identities and watched as many relatives perished in the Holocaust. This family history of persecution of the Jews has affected Harriet and Daniel, but whereas Harriet has responded to such horrors on a political level, Daniel has chosen a spiritual path.  Harriet, a human rights lawyer and feminist campaigner against sexual violence, has no time for religious fundamentalism, mainly because it exists, she believes, for the main purpose of controlling women. Her mother Enid is a retired academic and local Labour councillor who, in the 1970s, chaired the Greater London Council Film Viewing Board, where she battled it out with Mary Whitehouse over her pro-censorship stance. Enid&apos;s 1979 book on film censorship, I Don&apos;t Mind the Sex It&apos;s the Violence, is a classic liberal text. Daniel, however, does not allow any television in his household lest it corrupts and the only music and reading material allowed are those which have a religious focus. We arrive at Tel Aviv airport the day before the Jewish festival of Purim. The black-hatted, bearded men in their long, black coats are dotted around the airport. Ernest is one of the few Jewish men in our queue for passport control who is not wearing a skull cap and Enid&apos;s natural hair contrasts with the wigs sported by the married Orthodox Jewish women. While we are all looking forward to seeing the family, we are dreading what is ahead of us.  Daniel moved to Israel in 1987, aged 23. The first time I met him, just weeks after becoming involved with Harriet, he was talking about going to Israel to &quot;help the Palestinians&quot;. Daniel used to be &quot;a bit of a hippy&quot;, according to Harriet, and had been involved in anarchism during his university years. &quot;The rest of the family was involved in politics but Daniel did not find his niche there,&quot; she says. &quot;I think he was searching for something that belonged to him.&quot;  Soon after arriving in Israel, he met Zivah, an Iraqi Jew. They married and began experimenting with new age spirituality. Shortly after the birth of Hadara, encouraged by Zivah&apos;s brother (a Hassidic Jew) they turned to religion. Daniel is involved in the Hassidic sect known as the Breslov movement, founded by Rabbi Nachman in around 1800. Last year, Daniel made the annual Rosh Hashanah pilgrimage of male Breslovers to Nachman&apos;s grave in Uman, Ukraine, where he met the father of his daughter&apos;s prospective groom. &quot;This young man had been mentioned to me by three individuals as someone special who might be a good husband for my daughter,&quot; says Daniel. &quot;So I figured God had spoken and arranged to meet his father.&quot;  Breslovs, like other Hassidic Jews, usually meet through matchmakers in a process called a shidduch. There is a vague expectation that a bride and groom should be about the same age, the norm being between 17 and 25. Children are the main rationale of marriage. The average Hassidic family in the UK has eight children.  Hadara had a strictly religious, regimented upbringing, in contrast with that of her father and Harriet. By the time she married, Hadara had never been to a cinema, read a non-religious book, kissed a boy, had a glass of wine, or been to a mixed party.  We arrive at Daniel&apos;s home, in a gated religious community just outside Jerusalem, where Hadara, the bride-to-be, appears ecstatically happy. She tells us about her &quot;bride classes&quot;. Enid asks what she has learned from the classes: &quot;How to observe the laws of the Sabbath,&quot; she says, &quot;and to know how to run a good kosher home.&quot; I am dying to ask her what Hadara has been told about sex, but decide that under her parents&apos; watchful gaze it would not go down well. There is no dating in the Hassidic community. Boys and girls are educated and socialised separately. A typical Hassidic boy will never have spoken to any Hassidic girl - aside from his immediate family - before the matching process begins.  Arriving early at the wedding venue, we are just in time to find the caterers putting up the screens between the men&apos;s and women&apos;s sections. There are two top tables, one in each section. The food is flowing, but in the women&apos;s section there is no sign of alcohol. Few of the men are drinking, but there is the odd bottle of beer and red wine around and on the top table sits a bottle of whisky among the prayer books.  I am introduced to several friends and relatives of the groom. Ernest introduces me as Harriet&apos;s partner. While some assume he means we work together, others understand correctly and look profoundly uncomfortable. &quot;I suppose lesbianism is not exactly the done thing in Daniel&apos;s world,&quot; says Enid, &quot;but he accepts it in the way that Harriet accepts, to a degree, his belief system.&quot;  In the wedding hall, Harriet and I are mixing the vodka we have brought with us into our soft drinks. Ernest, although trapped in the men&apos;s section, has promised to sneak us some wine into the women&apos;s section and pass on any juicy gossip.  Hadara is sitting on her special bridal seat, surrounded by her friends. They look as they are - a group of giggling, teenage girls. In the men&apos;s section, I see Akim, davening [praying] frantically, his body bending and swaying, his prayer book held to his face. The two fathers lead Akim to the chuppa [the canopy traditionally used in Jewish weddings]. He continues to mumble the words of prayers, looking as if he is in some sort of trance. The music is beautiful and haunting. Hadara is brought to the chuppa by the two mothers and a grandmother, a thick veil covering her face, and is walked around the groom seven times as he davens wildly.  Harriet and I are separated from her parents in the throng, but afterwards we all agree that the ceremony was unlike anything we had ever witnessed. The atmosphere seemed to be bordering on hysteria and the oddest thing for all of us was being present at the wedding of a relative who is essentially a child. On top of this, Hadara has married a young man none of us knows.  Late in the evening, I sneak around the back of the venue and peer through the glass doors to the men&apos;s section. The band is in full swing and most of the men are dancing wildly. The groom is being paraded around the hall high above the shoulders of several men, perched on a chair. Back in the women&apos;s section, the dancing is somewhat more sedate. Several guests are looking after small children or feeding babies.  The day after the wedding, Harriet and I go with a political activist to the West Bank to meet Palestinian human rights groups organising against the apartheid-like conditions in which they are forced to live under punitive Israeli rule. We are both glad to be leaving the country the following day and can&apos;t imagine returning.  We all agree that the trip, though enjoyable in many ways, has been quite surreal. Enid and Ernest are trying to glean the positives out of the marriage, and are talking about how glowing their granddaughter was at the wedding and what a nice young man Akim seems. Harriet is laughing about the fact that two radical feminist lesbians came all the way to Israel for an arranged marriage when Daniel was forbidden by his rabbi to attend our civil partnership. A few weeks later, Daniel visits London and the family goes out for dinner. &quot;I was looking over at the two of them laughing and chatting away,&quot; says Enid, &quot;and realised that these days they seem to get on better than ever, certainly better than when they were children.&quot; Having suffered the death of the eldest child and witnessed the remaining two take paths in polarised and conflicting directions, the Wistrichs remain a family to aspire to. I, for one, am proud to be a part of it.

Old Israelis like myself are stupefied by the scope and scale of today&apos;s corruption and the multiplying investigations. Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays?  I do not believe that corruption is coming to light just because law enforcement is somehow better, or because citizens, like the presidential staff who accused President Katsav of sexual crimes and harassment, are more courageous. What is coming to light is a much deeper evil, a loss of values within Israeli society and its government, such as never existed before.  This moral deterioration is most prominent in the behaviour of today&apos;s accused, who are much more impudent and aggressive than in the past. I remember how in the 1970&apos;s, when suspicion of corruption arose with respect to a Labour party minister, the minister took his own life. So did a director of a great bank, a brilliant economist, when he was suspected of financial crimes.  When Pinchas Sapir, prime minister Golda Meir&apos;s finance minister died, all that he owned was a modest apartment in Tel Aviv and some small savings. David Ben Gurion, Israel&apos;s founder and most prominent political personality, spent the last 11 years of his life living in a little wooden house in the desert kibbutz Sde Boker. Today, that house&apos;s extreme modesty still surprises visitors. Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin also lived until his death in a simple apartment in Tel Aviv. Not the smallest shadow of the slightest suspicion of corruption ever disturbed his peace.  True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance. Economic interests are supplanting ideology as the motor of politics, and money serves as the key instrument in elections. But how is it that Israel, which only a few years ago was hardly touched by fraud and corruption, is now swept by them?  The recent episodes of corruption, I believe, are rooted in the division, beginning in 1967, of two altogether distinct sets of norms and values. On the one hand, the moral and jurisdictional principles of the democratic state have continued to be applied in Israel in accordance with the tradition of the rule of law. On the other hand, in the Palestinian territories, a new system of values has been progressively established.  These two systems operate side by side, but the border that separates them has gradually become more porous, and the open breaches in it have become ever greater. Unlike colonial states, in which colonisers came from distant metropolises (and only in small numbers) the Palestinian territories are just across the border from Israel.  In the West Bank the organs of jurisdiction operate in a completely different way. Palestinian lands are illegally confiscated. Jewish settlers act outside the law and commit provocative acts harming Palestinians, rarely incurring any penal sanctions. Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel.  The boundaries between the two types of legalities could not remain impenetrable forever. Little by little, the state of occupation, which should have been temporary, became a stable reality, and the policy of creating Israeli settlements in the heart of the Palestinian population strengthened the connection between Israel and the occupied territories. The norms of a colonial and militarist regime have begun to infiltrate the governing organs of Israel&apos;s democracy, perverting their proper activities. Politicians, functionaries, army officials \u2013 usually coming from the right \u2013 introduced into Israeli political life the disgraceful norms in force in the occupied territories. So corruption has grown.  Fortunately, Israel&apos;s judicial system remains independent and rests on foundations of proven integrity. The presence of many women in the magistrature and the police has also contributed significantly, in my view, to reinforcing the system. But when inadmissible norms become tolerated in silence, even the strongest juridical system becomes destabilised.  Nor should we forget that the global economy, with which Israel is deeply integrated, creates infinite and complex opportunities for financial crimes.  In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption. The support of public opinion is also needed.  I have the impression that the latest disturbing allegations of corruption among politicians and state functionaries have awakened Israel&apos;s citizens from their stupor. They are now demanding that the rule of law and justice return to their central place in public life. Of course, the true test will be whether such demands are reflected in September&apos;s parliamentary election.

In a letter to the Reuters news agency, Israel&apos;s top military lawyer, Brigadier General Avihai Mendelblit, said the troops involved in the shooting in April could not tell whether cameraman Fadel Shana, 24, was holding a camera or a weapon but nonetheless reached a &quot;reasonable conclusion&quot; that he was &quot;hostile&quot;. One of the reasons for the tank crew&apos;s suspicion, said Mendelblit, was that Shana and his soundman were wearing blue flak jackets, which the Israeli military lawyer said were &quot;common to Palestinian terrorists&quot;. The jackets were marked with the word &quot;PRESS&quot; and were identical to those worn by journalists reporting on conflicts across the world. Shana&apos;s car also carried large &quot;PRESS&quot; and &quot;TV&quot; markings. Shana was killed on a day of heavy fighting in Gaza that left 18 Palestinians, nearly all civilians, and three Israeli soldiers dead. Shana arrived shortly after a series of Israeli air strikes in a Gazan village and began filming. The last few seconds of his footage show an Israeli tank on a distant hilltop. There is a flash and a cloud of smoke as the tank fires a shell and moments later a second bright flash close to the camera as dark shapes come shooting out. The tape then goes black.  His body was hit by several inch-long metal flechette darts from the tank shell. David Schlesinger, editor-in-chief of Reuters, said yesterday he was disturbed by the decision. &quot;I&apos;m extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly,&quot; he said. &quot;They would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response.&quot; The decision came in a letter sent on Tuesday by Mendelblit, Israel&apos;s military advocate general. &quot;The tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti-tank missile, a mortar or a television camera,&quot; he wrote. He said the crew were suspicious partly because of the blue flak jackets, and because of an attack that killed three Israeli troops earlier in the day elsewhere in Gaza and because of a separate grenade attack on a tank. &quot;In light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon, the decision to fire at the targets ... was sound,&quot; he wrote.  &quot;Fadel Shana&apos;s death is a tragedy ... A journalist in action was killed by IDF [Israel Defence Force] fire, along with others not involved in the hostilities. However ... the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour ... I have therefore decided ... that no further legal measures will be taken.&quot; Reuters sent a letter back yesterday asking why the soldiers ruled out the possibility that Shana was indeed a cameraman and why the tank crew did not simply reverse out of sight. The Foreign Press Association in Tel Aviv said it was dismayed. &quot;The IDF&apos;s decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence,&quot; it said. &quot;The FPA believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing, especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-08-13T23:01:00Z", "title": "Gaza: Israel clears tank crew over killing of Reuters cameraman", "sentences": ["The Foreign Press Association in Tel Aviv said it was dismayed."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/israelandthepalestinians.reuters"}, {"tags": ["Comedy", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "Adam Sandler plays Zohan, hero of the Israeli army and top man on the Tel Aviv beach, who grows weary of his celebrity, fakes his death and escapes to New York to work as a hairdresser.

However Misha Glenny spotted it, writing in the New Statesman that Prime Minister Putin warned President Shimon Peres to &quot;pull out your trainers and weapons or we will escalate our co-operation with Syria and Iran&quot; \u2013 after which Israel dutifully complied.  Hizbullah&apos;s leader, Hassan Nasrallah also spotted it and subsequently mocked Israel&apos;s withdrawal, claiming that &quot;the entire front line of the [Israeli] army&apos;s brass stepped down because of the [Lebanon] war. Gal Hirsch, who was defeated in Lebanon, went to Georgia and they too lost because of him.&quot;  The Russians are indeed emboldened by their sweeping victory which has highlighted the impotence of both the US and Nato. Jonathan Spyer, in the Jerusalem Post, described Russian action as throwing down &quot;a direct challenge to the US-dominated post Cold-war international order&quot; and expressed concern over Moscow&apos;s willingness to supply Syria with the S-300 long-range anti-aircraft missile system, a defensive measure that has the potential to impede Israeli airstrikes such as the one that targeted a suspected Syrian nuclear site last September.  Then the BBC reported yesterday that Syria&apos;s President Assad met with President Medvedev at the Black Sea resort of Sochi to discuss &quot;deals on anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems&quot;. Like any customer visiting his main arms dealer, Assad praised Russian actions in Georgia, explaining that &quot;we understand the Russian stance and the Russian military response as a result of the provocations which took place. We appreciate the courageous decision taken by the Russian leadership in responding to the international initiatives and the start of withdrawing its forces&quot;. Assad also signalled his willingness to have Russian Iskander missiles (which according to GlobalSecurity.org are capable of overcoming the enemy&apos;s anti-missile defences and hitting targets at a distance of 280 kilometers) situated on Syrian territory, although he refused to commit to any timeline for such a deployment.  The Syrians have survived six years of Isolation led by Washington and Tel Aviv following 9/11, an isolation that has only shown recent signs of ending. If a small country like Syria can survive years of western isolation then the Russian bear empowered with petrodollars and a stable, if undemocratic, leadership, will surely feel more confident in throwing its foreign policy weight around.  The Times reported that Russia&apos;s activism, particularly in arms dealing, was sparking fears of a Middle East &quot;Cold War&quot;. In previous years Russia has respected US/Israeli &quot;red lines&quot; on supplying equipment to Syria; however with the potential red lines crossed by the other side in terms of support for Georgia and signing Poland up to the anti-ballistic missile treaty, all bets may be off. Indeed, the BBC reported the Russian reaction as an ominous foreign ministry statement saying that Moscow &quot;will be forced to react, and not only through diplomatic demarches&quot;. Syria has a number of offensive and defensive weapon orders pending, however what could radically alter the balance of power is a more overt Russian presence in the country itself. Over the past few years defence analysts have kept a close eye on the Russian navy&apos;s activity at the Syrian port of Tartus. There are real fears that the Russians are keen to transform what was little more than a refuelling station into a fully-fledged Russian Mediterranean fleet naval base where they can relocate much of the Black Sea fleet currently held up in Sevastopol.  Satellite shots of Russian involvement in dredging the port to allow access to larger vessels provide more evidence to support this theory which would place an aggressive Russia right on the doorstep of Israel and in close proximity to the strategic Turkish port of Ceyhan, the terminus of a major new oil pipeline linked to the Azerbaijani port city of Baku \u2013 an incendiary combination with huge tactical ramifications.  This makes grim reading for the lame duck leaders, Bush and Olmert, neither of whom have the political capital of the Russian Putin-Medvedev alliance. Perhaps the only manoeuvre that can undermine an aggressive Syrian-Iranian-Russian alliance is the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which are still ongoing. If they result in an unlikely peace treaty there is hope yet that this new and dangerous cold war will not emerge.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-22T11:30:00Z", "title": "James Denselow: Under Moscow's wing", "sentences": ["The Syrians have survived six years of Isolation led by Washington and Tel Aviv following 9/11, an isolation that has only shown recent signs of ending."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/syria.israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Scotland and Ireland listings", "Culture"], "article": "Ohad Naharin has been the creative motor behind this Tel Aviv-based dance company for 18 years, during which time he has created a major body of work.

And the reviews for this character were effusive: critics described the performance as &quot;transfixing&quot;, &quot;bombastic&quot; and &quot;unnervingly charismatic&quot;. He was the main reason viewers kept tuning in to the four-part television series about the Iraqi ruler. Everybody just loved the BBC&apos;s Saddam. &quot;The minute I heard about it, I knew that I and no one else would play him,&quot; says the Israeli actor Igal Naor. It&apos;s a curious sense of conviction, because when the BBC was casting for the role, Naor was virtually unknown outside Israel. True, he had appeared in the 2005 blockbuster film Munich, in which he played one of the Black September gunmen blown up by Mossad agents to avenge the assassination of 11 Israeli Olympian athletes. But his screen time was, by his own reckoning, &quot;less than five minutes - you know, the Mossad works quickly.&quot;  Naor, who says he always dreamed of playing Saddam Hussein, contacted the BBC series&apos; casting director and received no response. Then he emailed photos of himself sporting a swiftly improvised, sticky-taped-on block moustache and kefiyeh head scarf. &quot;Within less than an hour they called and asked how soon I could be in London.&quot;  It&apos;s not just the on-screen resemblance that made Naor a stunning Saddam. Dominating every frame, the actor conveyed with his very presence the bone-chilling, cultish charisma of the Iraqi dictator who ruled by bloody, ideologically-convinced terror. Neither was it a case of copycat acting.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t interested in recreating his every gesture and I didn&apos;t impersonate Saddam&apos;s voice, which was very high-pitched, like Kermit the Frog.&quot; He does a flash impression of Saddam talking, a nasal, drawling Arabic that instantly turns heads in the sedate Tel Aviv cafe where we are sitting.  His portrayal of the Iraqi ruler is &quot;beyond acting, it&apos;s just being,&quot; says Naor. &quot;I am him, and he is me.&quot; What, he is Saddam? &quot;Yes. I won&apos;t kill you, but it&apos;s me,&quot; he says. &quot;You don&apos;t find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you, perfectly you. The soul, the essence, we share it, me and him. I was astonished to realise that, but playing him, I felt that everything he did was exactly what I would do if I were in his place.&quot; We are talking about the ruthless dictator, torturer and murderer of thousands, including close friends, long-time colleagues and family-in-law? &quot;I understood him perfectly,&quot; says Naor. &quot;It is something that is connected with childhood, with pains that you have in your first years.&quot;  Similarities between the two men&apos;s childhoods are not glaringly obvious. Saddam&apos;s father abandoned him, and his abusive stepfather forced him to leave the family home, aged 10, and live with his uncle. Naor was born in 1958 in Givatayim, a well-heeled suburb of Tel Aviv. His Iraqi-Jewish parents migrated from Baghdad in the early 1950s, soon after the creation of Israel (they were &quot;strongly encouraged&quot; to drop their original, Arabic family name and adopt the Hebrew Naor). Naor describes a happy childhood home, but relates that he grew up in &quot;strange conditions&quot;. During early toddler years he was raised by his grandmother - like any Iraqi child, he says - while his parents worked. As a result, his mother tongue is Arabic and he didn&apos;t speak a word of Hebrew when he first attended nursery school.  &quot;Iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so I always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten,&quot; recalls Naor. &quot;I&apos;d say it in Arabic and nobody would understand. One day I must have just kept asking, nagging, and they got fed up and locked me in the toilet, and I stood on the seat shouting through the window, [In Arabic] &apos;Granny, granny, come and get me!&apos;&quot;  He grew up feeling different. &quot;I thought, I don&apos;t speak the language, I don&apos;t belong to you ... and life is a fight, a struggle and you have to change the world,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful - and Saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning. He did many great things for his country at first, like building a health system, education and nationalising oil revenues. And then he took the country to war with Iran and destroyed everything.&quot; Naor&apos;s Saddam comprised a dimension of the Iraqi dictator as a victim of geo-politics: a classic tragic hero. The series ending, which closed on Saddam moments before his hanging, managed to evince some sympathy for the dictator, hunted down, found hiding in a hole and executed for crimes against humanity. &quot;When you hear his name, you immediately, instinctively connect it with evil, a murderer, craziness, and so on,&quot; he says. &quot;If I played him only as that, I would just be fulfilling people&apos;s expectations and that&apos;s not interesting.&quot; The Iraqi ruler clearly came over as a brutal tyrant in the series. &quot;My role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance,&quot; says Naor. &quot;So, as Saddam, I believe every word I say, and I believe every terrible thing I do is for the good of the nation and every mistake I make is because I can&apos;t do things in any other way, because of who I am. That&apos;s the duty of any actor playing any role, but especially this role where there is so much prejudice.&quot;  While the BBC was scouting for a Saddam, Naor was on location for last year&apos;s film Rendition, in which he plays the Arab torturer-interrogator hired by the CIA to deal with terror suspects that the organisation has &quot;disappeared&quot; to a secret detention facility somewhere in the Middle East. He is currently working on Green Zone, a big-budget thriller inspired by the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City, Rajiv Chandrasekaran&apos;s expos\u00e9 of the US-controlled zone of Baghdad as an enclave of luxury and ignorance. In the film, due for release next year, Naor plays a politically ambiguous Iraqi general chased by American agents who are trying, post-2003 invasion, to find evidence of WMDs.  Both films raise bold questions over western policy in the Middle East and Naor&apos;s own sentiments echo that. He thinks that blanket US support gives Israel licence not to do anything &quot;to solve the problem with our brothers the Palestinians, the biggest problem in the Middle East&quot;. He talks about present-day Iraq, where the American administration &quot;just doesn&apos;t care. They only care about their interests. And the people are paying the price, with their blood.&quot; A communist since he was a teenager, Naor is decidedly anti-imperialist. &quot;I was born in a period of ideology. I never liked capitalism. I don&apos;t like people who think they can invade a country to change the regime or to kill the elected leader,&quot; he says. &quot;You are not the judge and not the police of the world. Who asked you? And how dare you? And what do you understand about it, anyway?&quot;  By his own admission, Naor&apos;s concern for Iraq goes deeper than the compassion he feels for human suffering, anywhere. &quot;My blood, my mentality is Iraqi,&quot; he says, pronouncing the country with a strong guttural &quot;Q&quot; just like his BBC Saddam. &quot;I really know the western game well and I play it,&quot; he says. &quot;But I felt at home when I was filming in Morocco and Tunisia. I speak the language; I like the food, the Araq [aniseed drink], the nargile [hookah]. Me and my Iraqi friends [in Israel] talk only in Arabic when we are together. We enjoy it - there is a lot of humour and nuances that we can never express in Hebrew.&quot; Among those friends are the Iraqi-Israeli actors Sasson Gabai and Uri Gavriel, who both featured in the House of Saddam.  In his home country, Naor is better known as a stage actor, having played countless lead roles spanning more than two decades in theatre. He is still remembered for roles in classic productions performed years ago. He is due to return to theatre later in the year, schedule permitting. Does he worry about being stereotyped as the Arab movie villain? &quot;I don&apos;t talk in terms of goodies and baddies,&quot; he says. &quot;I won&apos;t do roles that are just &apos;an Arab&apos; with nothing interesting about it. I also just turned down a big role because the script was anti-Israeli, it was coming from a place of hatred.&quot;  Despite the array of &quot;very nice&quot; roles he is offered these days, he does not think that he has achieved global stature. &quot;It is not an international career,&quot; he says. &quot;There is currently a wave of Middle Eastern films and it will pass. Anyway, my days of big dreams are behind me - I am 50; for an Iraqi that is beyond retirement!&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "Rachel Shabi talks to Israeli actor Igal Naor about his portrayal of Saddam Hussein", "sentences": ["&quot;I wasn&apos;t interested in recreating his every gesture and I didn&apos;t impersonate Saddam&apos;s voice, which was very high-pitched, like Kermit the Frog.&quot; He does a flash impression of Saddam talking, a nasal, drawling Arabic that instantly turns heads in the sedate Tel Aviv cafe where we are sitting.", "Naor was born in 1958 in Givatayim, a well-heeled suburb of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/26/television.bbc"}, {"tags": ["Reality TV", "The X Factor", "Television industry", "Television", "Media", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news", "Israel", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Entertainment", "Television & radio"], "article": "Backstage at a new reality TV show being filmed in Tel Aviv, a bunch of smartly dressed young men are nervously waiting to go on. When called to perform, one man is so elated that he misses his cue and forgets to start singing. Another dashes on and belts out a soulful song about how hard it is to find a valiant wife, the sort of woman who &quot;plants a vineyard&quot; and &quot;girds herself with strength&quot;. The judges love both acts - or so they say. They don&apos;t really have a choice. This programme may have been inspired by The X Factor, but someone else makes the rules here: God. Simon Cowell-style tirades against contestants might be good for ratings, but they go against God&apos;s command that people be kind to one another - even judges facing woeful contestants. This is The Upcoming Voice, a search for the next big thing in ultra-Orthodox Jewish music. The six-month contest is being run by Menachem Toker, a Radio Jerusalem DJ; viewers will vote contestants through the various rounds and then select a winner, who should go on to become a household name in Orthodox locales the world over. Polite judges aren&apos;t the only departure from the X Factor format. Traditionally, ultra-Orthodox Jews have had little or no contact with the arts. This changed in the mid-1990s, when the younger generation became fed up with going without music. A wave of musicians - mostly wedding singers who saw a gap in the market - started releasing &quot;kosher music&quot;. Frivolous subjects such as love and sexual attraction are out, and the lyrics are usually prayers or Biblical verses. Only men are permitted to perform.  The genre came into its own eight years ago, when the Chevra, a &quot;boy band&quot; of five young men, burst on to the scene with Y&apos;hay Shlama, an upbeat pop song that set an Aramaic prayer to a Britney-esque beat. Since the band&apos;s first album was released in 2001, the group has sold almost half a million CDs. But new arrivals with this kind of mass appeal are too few and far between to satisfy a growing market - hence the Upcoming Voice talent contest. One reason for the scarcity of popular singers is that ultra-Orthodox men tend to marry and start families young, which doesn&apos;t leave much time for a musical career. Another is that education for children is heavily religious, followed by several years in Talmudic seminary; attending university and other institutions of higher education, including singing schools, is not permitted, as they involve exposure to secular ideas. Almost as soon as The Upcoming Voice was conceived as an idea, it hit a number of hurdles. Firstly, the most obvious name for the programme, Kosher Idol, was off limits - Judaism is built on a rejection of idolatry. Yet this was the least challenging problem. Ultra-orthodox rabbis forbid the watching of television, claiming that it brings harmful ideas and immodest images into the home. And reality TV, if it means showing people&apos;s slip-ups and judges&apos; frank analysis, is further frowned upon. Alongside a general imperative to act kindly, there is a specific prohibition against subjecting people to embarrassment.  To get around the ban on television, the show is being distributed on CDs that can be viewed on a computer, a permissible piece of equipment so long as it is not hooked up to the web, which is outlawed for similar reasons. These discs are available across Israel, and, while they are not sold elsewhere, many of the 60,000 Israeli viewers post them on to friends and family abroad, where interest is high.  The contest&apos;s religious character influences everything, from the lyrics to the outfits. There are no points to be won for snazzy attire: this show targets a community that likes its young men smart, but not cool. The contestants invariably wear the ultra-Orthodox uniform of black trousers and shoes, a white shirt and a black-velvet skullcap. The most daring contestant had light stripes on his trousers. An unlikely player in all of this is Ken Burgess, songwriter for the British psychedelic rock band Tomorrow, whose song My White Bicycle was a hit when it was covered by the Scottish rock band Nazareth in 1975. Burgess, who has converted to Judaism, sits on the Upcoming Voice panel, delivering his compliments in a cockney drawl that is subtitled for Israeli viewers. He dismisses the suggestion that the judges&apos; unremitting positivity defeats the purpose of a reality show. &quot;These young guys don&apos;t need some idiot to tell them they are rubbish,&quot; he says. &quot;I say, thank God there can be an area within music that is a little bit softer than the mainstream, somewhere where young guys can develop their talents without being trounced.&quot; The show, argues Toker, illustrates just how much ultra-Orthodox attitudes towards music and the arts have moved on since the 90s. Instead of rejecting it altogether, they are &quot;taking the best from the secular world, but altering it to make it kosher&quot;. He adds that there is now a good market for albums, as well as large-scale concerts. &quot;None of this clashes with our religion - so long as we remember that being a singer is very well and good, but it doesn&apos;t make you a star. For us, rabbis are the only real stars, and we want it to stay that way&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "Nathan Jeffay on The Upcoming Voice - Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jewish answer to The X Factor", "sentences": ["Backstage at a new reality TV show being filmed in Tel Aviv, a bunch of smartly dressed young men are nervously waiting to go on."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/26/realitytv.thexfactor"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Police in Israel are searching for a missing girl who detectives fear was killed by her grandfather and whose disappearance has gripped the nation.

The girl&apos;s mother, Marie-Charlotte Renault, 23, and the child&apos;s paternal grandfather, Ronny Ron, 45, who were in a relationship, are both being held on remand suspected of involvement in the murder. Although Rose disappeared in May, police only heard of her disappearance two weeks ago when they were alerted by welfare workers that the girl was missing from her home in Netanya.

Renault and her father-in-law lived together as a couple and had two more children, and a year ago began a custody case to get Rose from France to live with them in Israel. In December, they won custody and Rose went to live with them. But reports said she was suffering from severe speech and behavioural problems and that the couple struggled to manage the child. Police said Ron had given several accounts of what happened to the girl, which included suggestions she had been sold to Palestinians or sent to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish boarding school.

Nathan did seem an unlikely warrior for peace in the Middle East, but he invariably had the last laugh. When, in 1968, he mooted the idea for an offshore pirate radio station that would spread regional goodwill, sceptics predicted that it would sink, metaphorically if not literally. Instead, the Voice of Peace blasted out pop, political commentaries and celebrity interviews for 21 years. Many also thought Nathan mad when, in 1977, he sailed through the Suez Canal distributing chocolates and toys to Arab children. By the year&apos;s end, though, Nathan and fellow Israelis were negotiating directly with President Sadat. Their meeting presaged Sadat&apos;s visit to Jerusalem, and the 1979 bi-national peace treaty. Israeli security chiefs regarded Nathan as dangerously naive for talking to the Palestine Liberation Organisation&apos;s Yasser Arafat in 1989, and he spent nine months in prison in 1991 for his contact with the PLO. Yet within four years, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was shaking hands with Arafat at the White House. Nathan was an entrepreneur, a man with business acumen, an ability to exploit photo opportunities - and a hatred of injustice and suffering. He was born the third child of observant Jewish parents, in Abadan, which is now in Iran. His Yemeni-born father worked for the Anglo-Iranian oil company (now BP) and later prospered as a linen-trader. At six, Nathan began at a Jesuit boarding school in Bombay. In 1939 his entire family moved to India. When his mother discovered that he adored Catholic icons, she enrolled him at the Jewish Sir Jacob Sassoon school - which imbued Nathan with a love of patriotic Hebrew songs. Flying was a lifelong obsession. He took his wings with the Royal Air Force in 1945 and two years later had the traumatic experience of transporting Hindu and Muslim refugees between just-partitioned India and Pakistan. In 1948, after ferrying planes and parts from Czechoslovakia for the nascent Israeli Air Force, Nathan bombarded Galilee villages and the Egyptian army from a converted DC3 transport plane. Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, the future Egyptian president, survived one of his raids. After later visiting several villages, Nathan was shocked at the damage he had caused. He befriended many civilians, including one Arab woman who regularly visited him after his 1996 stroke. From 1950 to 1959 Nathan worked for Israel&apos;s national airline, El Al. He then managed the California, an American-style Tel Aviv restaurant credited with introducing the hamburger to Israel. It was soon a focus for bohemians and the intelligentsia. Then, in 1966, aboard his 1927 Boeing-Steerman biplane, Shalom One, he flew into Egyptian airspace - and into a new career as a political maverick. He had hoped to present President Nasser with a 60,000-signature peace petition, but although courteously greeted, he was arrested and sent home. Never short of chutzpah, he then contrived to meet Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, Robert Kennedy and the Pope, and demanded their help to end Arab-Israeli hostilities. In 1967, he repeated his one-man invasion of Egypt, and was returned again. This time he spent 40 days in an Israeli prison for &quot;unauthorised contact with the enemy&quot;. Via the California, Nathan had grasped that most young Israelis in the 1960s hankered after a western lifestyle, rather than the austerities of the founding generation. Yet no Middle Eastern radio stations were broadcasting Anglo-American pop and rock. In 1969, Dutch supporters helped him buy a 188ft freighter for a radio station. Three years of further fund-raising culminated with Nathan going on hunger strike to raise the final $40,000. By 1972 his Voice of Peace, which would be staffed by a mixture of Jewish and Arab Israelis, Filipinos, English, Dutch and Americans, began broadcasting to nearly 30 million listeners in English, French, Hebrew and Arabic. It even urged Israeli and Arab forces to lay down their arms during the 1973 Yom Kippur war. In 1993 Nathan shut the Voice down, convinced that the signing of the Oslo Accords meant peace was on its way. He was a deeply spiritual man, but not strictly Orthodox - rabbis berated him for broadcasting over the Sabbath and, in 1978, he went on hunger strike against nationalist religious Jews building West Bank and Gaza settlements. He carried a miniature Bible and used the scriptures to explain his leftwing views. In 1996 he suffered the first of the strokes that ultimately deprived him of speech. He was confined to a residential home and forgotten by many former friends who thought he had died. In lucid moments, he would recall his early days in India, a place that held a special place in his heart. When healthy, he had often revisited the country and found solace in Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. One of his proudest honours was being trustee of the Bangalore-based multi-faith Sarvodaya International Trust for peace. Nathan never let ill-health or mounting debts curb his zeal. In the late 1960s he raised funds for starving Biafrans and was the first foreign pilot to fly sustenance into the Nigerian war zone; in 1972 he sailed to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua; in 1978 he donated toys and medicines to a Beirut refugee camp. He flew to a Northern Irish peace summit in 1982; visited Ethiopia to publicise the 1984 famine; and in 1991 airlifted aid to Kurdish war refugees in Iraq. Ten years later he spearheaded a team of 14 Israelis and four American Jews who helped alleviate conditions for 300,000 Rwandans stranded in a refugee camp in what was then Zaire. He made mercy dashes to Somalia, Guatemala, flood-stricken Bihar in India, and unsuccessful representations in Moscow for Jewish prisoners of conscience. On hearing of his death, tributes were paid both by the Israeli president, Shimon Peres and the Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset, Ahmad Tibi. His dreams and sacrifices inspired the Oslo process and Israel&apos;s treaties with Jordan and Egypt, say supporters. Paradoxically, Nathan&apos;s example inspired rightwingers in 1978 to moor their own pirate station alongside the Voice of Peace. It was shut down by the government, prompting protests that Nathan had never suffered such ignominy. The Israeli Davar newspaper countered that Nathan had never spread racism, but &quot;preached peace between nations and peoples&quot;. Perhaps that should be his epitaph. In 1951 Nathan&apos;s shortlived first marriage ended in divorce, and he separated from his Colombian second wife.

Earlier in the week GBB&apos;s director Chris Spice said the non-participation of London 2012 ambassador Deng in the European Championships could seriously harm the GB basketball team&apos;s chances of competing in London 2012.  &quot;This is a devastating blow,&quot; said Spice. &quot;If Luol doesn&apos;t participate this season or any other season leading up to London, there is no question our involvement is in doubt. The world governing body [Fiba] has not been very specific, but we know from discussions that we need to be playing in the A division tournament in Europe to be given a place in the Olympics. &quot;If we fall out of the A division next year and cannot participate in the A division for [the 2011 European Championships], there is a real possibility we will not play in London.&quot; British Basketball today said that they are continuing to work with all parties in the hope of resolving the situation.  MetLife cover the top 150 salaries in the NBA and after signing a new \u00a336m six-year contract with the Chicago Bulls this month, 23-year-old Deng falls into this group. But under the terms of its agreement with the NBA, MetLife has the right to exclude 14 high-risk players every year. If a player has a history of injury problems and a long-term contract then MetLife can exercise this right.  Deng, who was born in Sudan but moved to south London as a child, has the fourth highest value contract in the NBA at present and last November missed three games after injuring his back. An MRI scan was used by MetLife to exclude him from cover. Therefore the GBB must find \u00a3250,000 from their annual budget of \u00a31.5m to pay for the additional cover needed to secure the player&apos;s services.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-29T12:03:09Z", "title": "London Olympics: Deng insurance row could stop GB's basketball team from competing in 2012", "sentences": ["The Chicago Bulls forward is excluded from cover by the NBA&apos;s insurer, MetLife, and will require additional cover if he is to be available to play in the A Division qualifying campaign, which starts against Israel in Tel Aviv next week."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/29/ussport.olympics2012"}, {"tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2008", "Dance", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Festivals", "Edinburgh festival"], "article": "Waving and bowing as the audience take their seats, the inflated human-shaped balloon on stage sets the tone for the evening ahead. It moves well, bends in extraordinary places, is accessibly witty. But it is ultimately tethered to a one-dimensional vision. Deca Dance 2008 is a compilation of extracts of old and new works by Ohad Naharin, choreographic supremo of Batsheva, the Tel Aviv-based contemporary dance company founded in 1964 by Martha Graham. Over the past 18 years, Batsheva has been transformed by Naharin&apos;s charismatic direction and &quot;gaga&quot;. Coined to describe a movement philosophy that arose from Naharin&apos;s response to back injury, &quot;gaga&quot; borrows from, then circumvents, the formalities of technique to form a primal, instinctive physical language. All seven segments in the Edinburgh Deca reconstruction include the distinctive walks, semaphoric arms, popular dance-hall moves and stretchy shapes of &quot;gaga&quot;, which, at its best, projects a dynamic energy in close connection with the audience. Naharin&apos;s Virus places a wall of dancers downstage. Poised to strike a move, they do so, one at a time, in a wild but tensely controlled and phenomenally fast release of limbs. The line stands firm until the very end. Anaphaza and Zachacha (which includes the company&apos;s fun audience-participation ploy) and Telophaza, employ this group model - and the line - to develop comforting repeat patterns. But they also confirm a deep sense of belonging and conviction among the dancers, who move as one in disciplined step. It is this projection of collective energy alongside the music - a jazzy mix of romantic popular mainstream, classical, Israeli and works composed by Naharin - that defines Batsheva. Yet these characteristics are also what limits its reach, leaving the choreography of 2008&apos;s B/olero, stripped down to carry two lone dancers, feeling slightly thin. \u00b7 Ends tonight.

For two hours at a time, from the Gulf to the Caspian, the country believed to have the world&apos;s third largest oil reserves doesn&apos;t have the electricity to power homes, traffic lights, hospitals and the rest of civic life. There are reports of deaths in hospitals in Tehran&apos;s swankiest neighbourhoods, the traffic in Isfahan, Shiraz and the capital grinds to a halt as traffic signals cease and in smaller towns there are angry demonstrations.  The energy ministry&apos;s decision to publish &quot;blackout timetables&quot; hasn&apos;t helped things and the official statistics \u2013 a 32,000 mW grid can&apos;t satisfy 34,000 mW needs \u2013 don&apos;t wash. The lights are out in Bandar Abbas on Iran&apos;s southern coast, in Sistan-Baluchestan towards Afghanistan and Mazandaran towards Turkmenistan. A deputy energy minister, Professor Mohammad Ahmadian has been replaced but resignations over the issue are less to do with competence than President Ahmadinejad juggling positions in his favour, ahead of next year&apos;s presidential elections. Perhaps Ahmadian paid the price of raising the spectre of a five-fold increase in electricity prices. The free marketeers in the government who see a bright future in membership of the World Trade Organisation call for the government subsidy for domestic electricity to be slashed.  The middle classes who quietly bear the irritation of two-hour queues to fill up their cars at petrol stations occasionally rise up. At much-publicised recitals of Persian music in Tehran, the lights went out just as renowned world music star, Homayoun Shajarian, got on stage. After thousands of people clapped in the darkness, singing the &quot;old&quot; pre-revolution national anthem (even women&apos;s voices could be heard and women are not allowed to sing in public), the star&apos;s more famous father, Mohammad Reza Shajarian got on stage and denounced the government. He said the interior ministry was deliberately trying to stop Iranians from listening to the music of their country. Visibly angry, the audience&apos;s mood was less anticipation of complex, jazz-like permutations of Dastgahs on Dafs, Tars, Tombaks, Setars, Kamanchehs, Neys, Tanburs, Santurs, and Uds and more on political change. It was the same at the concert of Iranian Kurd Shahram Nazeri, incongruously held at one of the Shah&apos;s old palaces and where the VIPs were police. The lights didn&apos;t go out but there was chaos after the traffic lights of Tehran, sophisticated ones that tell drivers how long they have to wait before they change, all dimmed.  It was bad enough in the cold winter when power cuts plagued 11 provinces and the National Iranian Gas Company warned Iranians to moderate their consumption or face further cuts. Ironically, the more environmentally-sound sources of energy - hydroelectric plants - are causing some of the worst power cuts. The reasons for the power cuts are endemic bad planning by a corrupt elite as well as members of that elite siphoning off oil for export. Those profits end up overseas with the trickle-down in Iran reaching North Tehran BMW-dealerships and bootleggers.  Without electricity, the economy continues to self-destruct. In the scorching heat, offices cannot operate without air-conditioners and the little manufacturing done in Iran is threatened with even more disasters. Making deals with China necessitated the opening up of the Iranian market to cheap Chinese goods so at this rate the little of it done at home will be destroyed.  Official inflation is near 30% and only the continued subsidy for food allows many to live. Iran may look richer than every other avowedly Muslim country on earth but it is teetering on the brink.

The Guardian has mapped out some of those relationships that give shape to al-Qaida in the UK. Most of the men who feature within the network are young - some barely out of their teens - and most are British of Pakistani origin. A handful immigrated to Britain from various parts of Africa, while three were born in the Caribbean and one is of Turkish Cypriot origin. What links them is not only faith and ideology, but close family bonds, friendships made at further education colleges and places of work, and personal ties forged at training camps, both in the lawless tribal areas of north-west Pakistan, and in the national parks of England. The five men convicted in 2007 of plotting to bomb the Ministry of Sound nightclub in central London, for example, were said in court to be associates of Zeeshan Siddiqui, who went on the run in October 2006 after being subjected to a control order. Although never convicted of any offence, the Old Bailey heard that Siddiqui trained with a number of the Ministry of Sound plotters at a terrorism training camp in Pakistan, and even considered volunteering for a suicide bomb attack.  Growing up in Hounslow, west London, Siddiqui was a close friend of Asif Hanif, who attempted to kill himself in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv.  Another of the Ministry of Sound gang is a brother of two other men who went on the run after being subjected to control orders. Yet another worked at the same taxi firm in Luton as a shadowy figure nicknamed Q, who has been identified in court as being instrumental in arranging for Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the July 7 2005 bombers, to travel to Pakistan, where he attended a terrorism training camp. Khan returned to Pakistan the following year, and is known to have attended another camp at the same time that Muktar Said Ibrahim, the leader of the July 21 bombers, was undergoing terrorism training in Pakistan. Both men returned to the UK at around the same time, armed with bomb-making expertise that allowed them to construct almost-identical devices. Ibrahim and members of his group had previously undergone some form of training in the Lake District, northern England, alongside several men who were later convicted of training for jihad in the New Forest on England&apos;s south coast. The influence of two other figures, Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri Mohammed, can be seen in the backgrounds of many of these men. Many listened to Hamza&apos;s sermons at Finsbury Park mosque in north London, while many passed through al-Muhajiroun, the now outlawed organisation that Bakri formed in London in 1996. Last year, Peter Clarke, then the head of Scotland Yard&apos;s Counter-Terrorism Command, said: &quot;We are seeing networks within networks, connections within connections, and links between individuals that cross local, national and international boundaries.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-09-04T15:57:55Z", "title": "Closely linked network behind many terror plots", "sentences": ["Growing up in Hounslow, west London, Siddiqui was a close friend of Asif Hanif, who attempted to kill himself in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/sep/04/4"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "Jerusalem is shaping up for one of the most significant events in its contemporary history. On November 11, the Israeli capital will go to the polls to choose the successor to Uri Lupolianski. The future of the city is once again a subject for negotiations between the Israeli government and the PA, the &quot;secular flight&quot; continues, and east Jerusalem Palestinians remain as alienated from the authorities as ever. The mayor of Jerusalem is a powerful position; the city&apos;s residents have an important decision to make.  Meet the candidates: The favourite, according to the polls, is city council opposition leader Nir Barkat. Having spent huge sums of money to prevent the Haredisation of the city, he views this election as a last chance to stop it becoming a Jewish Tehran. His task is made easier by the fact that his ultra-orthodox opponent, MK Meir Porush, isn&apos;t supported throughout the Haredi community. There is an agreement between the two main Haredi parties \u2013 Porush&apos;s Agudat Yisrael and the incumbent Lupolianski&apos;s Degel Hatorah \u2013 that they will take turns to field candidates in Jerusalem mayoral elections. This, despite the fact that Lupolianski has turned out to be a relatively popular and conciliatory mayor. Porush is considered much more extreme, and was apparently one of the key figures behind the veiling of the scantily clad dancers at the recent opening of the city&apos;s new Bridge of Strings. In a distant third sits the billionaire Arcadi Gaydamak, the owner of the football club Beitar Jerusalem and a man with grand political ambitions.  What about the Palestinians? East Jerusalem Palestinians make up around 40% of the city&apos;s population, but have hitherto boycotted the municipal elections on the dubious logic that to participate would mean effectively recognising Israeli sovereignty over the city. In a recent interview with Ha&apos;aretz, Sari Nusseibeh predicted that a Palestinian would finally run for mayor this time, but on behalf of all Palestinians in the occupied territories. Some have speculated that Nusseibeh himself might stand.  The Palestinian decision to boycott the elections has been a disaster. It has exacerbated the lower quality of services in Palestinian neighbourhoods and has weakened the Palestinian&apos;s politically. Meir Porush, with his calls for Israel to &quot;dismantle its nuclear weaponry like Libya is doing&quot;, is hardly the world&apos;s biggest Zionist; he recognises that the prosperity of his ultra-orthodox constituency depends on taking an active part in the city&apos;s institutions. The point is not to be a freier, a sucker. Jerusalem&apos;s elections hint at what might happen in Israeli elections if the peace versus security debate wasn&apos;t the dominant paradigm. Each sector is myopically concerned with taking its share of the pie, without pausing to remember that Jerusalem is home to many communities, each with its own special needs. The Palestinians should do what is necessary to take their fair share like anyone else, whilst making sure to stress the Machiavellian motives that lie behind the change of policy.  I&apos;m living in Jerusalem at the moment, but won&apos;t be voting in the elections. By the end of September, I hope to be a resident of Tel Aviv once again. There&apos;s no doubt that the diversity of Jerusalem&apos;s population makes it potentially an exciting, multicultural place. But I&apos;m not convinced by Barkat, whose campaign has unfortunately been tinged with rhetoric concerning the &quot;demographic threat&quot; posed by Palestinians. My secular friends are dispirited when they hear that yet another comrade is leaving, but decisions about where to live should not be taken for demographic reasons, and I fail to see the difference between opposing the ultra-orthodox growth in the city and the Palestinian one. What is needed is to ensure that the city is run for all its residents, irrespective of their numbers, with a genuine pluralism driving policy.

Settlement expansion has made peace harder to achieve. It erodes trust, it heightens Palestinian suffering, it makes the compromises Israel needs to make for peace more difficult.&quot; In that case, the decision by the British government to rent space for our new embassy in Tel Aviv from the Africa-Israel Investments company chaired by businessman Lev Leviev sends precisely the wrong message. Leviev, a Russian-Israeli real estate and diamond billionaire who recently became a UK resident, is also a major settlement builder. Danya Cebus, a subsidiary of Leviev&apos;s Africa-Israel group, has built homes in three West Bank settlements - Mattityahu East, Har Homa, and Ma&apos;ale Adumim.  Additionally, Leviev is a major donor to the Land Redemption Fund (LRF), which is affiliated with the radical fundamentalist Gush Emunim settler movement. The LRF uses highly questionable methods to secure Palestinian land for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, in clear violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva convention. The settlement of Mattityahu East along with Israel&apos;s wall, which was built mostly inside the occupied West Bank to grab land for settlements, seizes 50% of the village of Bil&apos;in&apos;s land, including olive groves that its residents have relied on for centuries. Leviev&apos;s Zufim settlement, again along with Israel&apos;s Wall, seizes as much as two-thirds of the village of Jayyous&apos; agricultural land and six wells, effectively annexing one of the West Bank&apos;s most fertile agricultural zones. Since 2002, residents of Bil&apos;in and Jayyous have held more than 250 nonviolent protests, with the support of Israeli and international activists, in an effort to save their lands. The Israeli army meets the protesters with clubs, teargas, bullets, curfews, arrests and stink sprays. The settlements where Leviev&apos;s companies have recently built homes trap Palestinians in disconnected enclaves, destroying the possibility of creating a viable Palestinian state. The settlements of Ma&apos;ale Adumim and Har Homa constitute part of an outer ring of settlements that cut off East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, and separate its north from its south. Israel&apos;s facts on the ground, created by companies like Leviev&apos;s, make the two-state solution impossible, resulting in a de facto one-state solution, in which half the population lives under apartheid-like conditions \u2013 contradicting Israel&apos;s proclaimed democracy. Having raised this issue in petitions and pressure on Israel&apos;s architects and construction industry, Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine has protested at Leviev&apos;s Bond Street jewelry boutique, in conjunction with Adalah-NY, which has also carried out a series of protests at Leviev&apos;s Madison Avenue store in New York. These actions respond to a call for a boycott of Leviev&apos;s companies issued by the villages of Jayyous and Bil&apos;in - a call that has also been taken up by US and Israel-based peace groups and the Palestinian Boycott National Committee, which represents 171 Palestinian civil society organisations. Yet the British government seems to be immune to taking positive action. In late June, after three Israeli settler leaders were invited to the Tel Aviv home of the UK ambassador, Tom Phillips, for the Queen&apos;s birthday, Crispin Blunt MP sent a blistering protest letter to Foreign Office minister Kim Howells. &quot;Entertaining the pioneers of this colonisation movement has certainly given the strong impression that Britain tacitly endorses it or no longer objects to it,&quot; demonstrating a &quot;weakening in the government&apos;s long-held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace&quot;. Blunt demanded that British taxpayers&apos; money should not be &quot;spent entertaining those who violate the Fourth Geneva Conventions and whose very presence has been an obstacle to a vital and much needed peace deal in the Middle East&quot;.

Quite improbable, perhaps. Unthinkable even. Long-range forecasts are never an exact science. Someone told me this was going to be a glorious summer. I must have slept through it. It&apos;s all too easy to, as the consultants would say, talk the talk. Deeds, rather than empty promises, are what truly counts. There were vows aplenty at London&apos;s 02 Arena on Saturday. Great Britain&apos;s men lived up to their promise against the Czech Republic by making a winning debut at a venue where they will hope to return in four years time for the latter stages of the Olympic Games. A lofty target, that, but it is just one of the ambitions laid down in a new strategy unveiled for British Basketball, entitled Game On, which has set down a number of lofty goals for the next eight years. They also include developments such as full-time leagues for men and women, more sponsorship backing, and a major presence in every large city of the UK. As GB demonstrated  in coming within 0.5 seconds of beating Israel in Tel Aviv a week ago, there is cause to be hopeful about the future on the court. Finishing top of their group and earning a berth in Poland at the next Eurobasket is a distinct possibility. The squad contains a present NBA star (Luol Deng of the Chicago Bulls), a potential one (Joel Freeland, drafted two years ago by the Portland Trailblazers), and two former NBA players (Pops Mensah Bonsu and Robert Archibald) who have opted to pursue their careers in the tough Spanish ACB League despite interest in their services across the Atlantic. With the right support a place on the podium in 2012 is not a far-fetched desire. Elsewhere there are flaws aplenty and little time to make permanent repairs. Basketball&apos;s Achilles heel has always been the fractious relationship between the three home nations (Northern Ireland joins with its island neighbour) and, in particular, a long history of managerial ineptitude in its English governing body. Whether, as the strategy decrees, all will be willing to subsume themselves to the common cause is yet to be seen. &quot;Time is critical to do what we need to do,&quot; stated Alistair Gray, the chairman of British Performance Basketball. &quot;We only have 36 weeks with our teams between now and 2012. So it means we&apos;ve got to be very intensive in our preparation. We only get the players for a relatively small period of time each year. So what we see is inspiring the home countries to raise their game and raise their bars through their competitions and elite development. &quot;We&apos;ve already had extra support from Sportscotland. I&apos;m meeting with the chief executive of the Sports Council for Wales in a few weeks. England Basketball are putting a new strategy into Sport England. Our job is to help make that consistent and enable them, hopefully, to produce great basketball players.&quot; One of the barometers of success or failure will be the public&apos;s interest in what is now a national team to be proud of. Just shy of 7,500 paying punters turned out in London. Similar numbers are expected in Birmingham tomorrow to witness the visit of Bosnia and in Liverpool to welcome Israel on Saturday. But to place that in context, the 17,000-capacity O2 is sold out for next month&apos;s NBA pre-season encounter between the New Jersey Nets and Miami Heat. Even though that \u2013 in competitive terms \u2013 has no more significance than my weekly pick-up game with the mighty Darroch BC. The atmosphere to witness the Czech match was fairly stagnant, the presentation shy of what you&apos;d come to expect. Plus it will take time for people to forge bonds of loyalty towards their side. A familiar mantra from the officials was to be heard during their Powerpoint presentation: &quot;Basketball&apos;s already a major sport because so many people play it.&quot; Those of us who have been around it long enough to feel aged know that means absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. None of the GB games are being televised (Channel 4 sniffed, but the budget had been blown on Deng&apos;s insurance). The British League will likely begin its new season next month without TV coverage (talks have been held with Sky but not enough sponsorship has yet been found to cover the cost). Even the NBA, who will meet Five on Wednesday, has yet to finalise its own deal. Basketball, it would appear, might be knocking on the door of the genuine mainstream but the invite is still in the post. Olympic success would be a major boon but that remains an ambition rather than a guarantee. Much still needs to come together if &quot;Game On&quot; is not to become &quot;Game Over&quot;.

By supporting a peace deal in Lebanon and reopening indirect talks with Israel Syria&apos;s President Bashar al-Assad secured himself an invitation to the Bastille Day celebrations in Paris earlier this year. Now Nicholas Sarkozy&apos;s visit to Damascus, the first by a western head of state since 2005, is being heralded as another major step in Syria&apos;s international rehabilitation. It&apos;s worth noting that Syria&apos;s exclusion was never that substantial. Though shunned by western heads of state, Damascus didn&apos;t face the kind of economic penalties that crippled Saddam Hussein. The modest sanctions imposed by the US were not emulated by the European and Arab states with which Syria conducts most of its trade. Similarly, only the Americans recalled their ambassador, and even they kept their Damascus embassy open and functioning. Nonetheless Sarkozy&apos;s trip does represent the beginning of the end for this (albeit limited) western diplomatic boycott. What&apos;s interesting is how Syria has achieved this without making itself any more palatable to the west: remaining a dictatorship with strong ties to the feared Iran, Hamas and Hizbullah. To some extent there has been a shift in the west&apos;s priorities. The democracy-spreading idealism that prompted Syria&apos;s ostracism has been abandoned in the Iraqi quagmire. Instead, Sarkozy&apos;s promotion of dialogue suggests a return to stability-orientated pragmatism. However, as important in Syria&apos;s rehabilitation has been Assad&apos;s own statesmanship in carving out a regional importance for himself that has become impossible for the west to ignore. When Syria&apos;s international relations were at their lowest point, following the withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005, Assad did not fold under pressure. In defiance of US criticism, he continued to facilitate the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, provide arms and support for Hizbullah and Hamas, and further ties with Ahmedinejad&apos;s Iran. Calculated but intelligent, such moves ensured that Syria remained a key player in the region&apos;s geopolitics, and provided the Assad regime with at least some diplomatic leverage having just lost its prized Lebanon card. At the same time, Damascus cast its net out for allies. While the EU and traditional Arab friends Egypt and Saudi Arabia were toeing the US line of exclusion, Assad found two crucial, though unlikely, friends: Turkey and Qatar. Eager to promote itself as a global player and to take advantage of its rival Saudi Arabia&apos;s absence from the scene, Qatar&apos;s increased ties with Assad has served both states well. Through the alliance Damascus has received substantial investment while Doha has enhanced its international reputation, most notably by brokering the recent Lebanon peace agreement. More significant has been the alliance with Turkey. A member of Nato, an ally of Israel and a country with which Syria was on the brink of war less than a decade ago, Ankara was not Assad&apos;s most obvious ally. Yet, through his quiet abandonment of claims to Turkish territory in 2005 and his unwavering support for prime minister Erdogan&apos;s operations against Kurdish rebels in Iraq last winter, Assad has fostered a tight alliance. This has led to trade agreements, open borders and now, mediation with Israel. More recently, the same opportunism that had Assad rushing to endorse Erdogan&apos;s invasion of Iraq was seen in supporting Moscow&apos;s conflict with Georgia. While Israel condemned attempts to start a &quot;new Cold War&quot; in the Middle East, Assad&apos;s swift trip to Russia displayed an astute reading of the political climate to secure a lifeline for Syria&apos;s antiquated defences. Far from contradicting the new peace moves with Tel Aviv, a stronger military warns Olmert&apos;s successor of the possible consequences of abandoning these negotiations. Assad has skilfully used these newfound friends to revive Syria&apos;s international fortunes without cutting ties with his more sinister allies. In fact, Damascus has had to concede very little to achieve this. Though applauded for the peace in Lebanon, it was the opposition who submitted to Syria&apos;s original demands: a veto for its allies in a power-sharing government and Hizbullah to keep its arms. Moreover, though praised for reviving talks with Israel, in setting out its peace aims recently, Damascus has made no departure from its goals since 1973: a land-for-peace agreement in the Golan Heights. Though major steps have been made, to truly be rehabilitated Syria needs to make serious progress with Israel and that still depends on who will succeed Bush and Olmert. Fortunately, as an unelected dictator, Bashar al-Assad can afford to wait and see. In the meantime Syria finds itself in a stronger position than it has been in years and its president is proving surprisingly skilled at foreign affairs. From the disastrous policies that led to the 2005 Lebanon crisis and withdrawal, Assad has used opportunism, calculation and grit to claw Syria back on to the international scene.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-10T10:30:00Z", "title": "Chris Phillips: How Syria came in from the cold", "sentences": ["Far from contradicting the new peace moves with Tel Aviv, a stronger military warns Olmert&apos;s successor of the possible consequences of abandoning these negotiations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/10/lebanon.syria"}, {"tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "When Tal Ben Haim left Chelsea for Manchester City the general consensus was that he was heading in the direction where no footballer wants to go: down. That, of course, was before Thaksin Shinawatra placed City for sale, the billionaire Abu Dhabi royal family got involved and, suddenly, a club that had won nothing but sympathy since 1976 started talking about elbowing Manchester United out of the way, bulldozing through the Premier League and not stopping until they had planted their flag at the top of European football. It is the kind of wealth, in other words, that means Ben Haim can dare to believe it is possible to achieve everything at City that he had hoped for in his brief, ultimately unhappy, spell with his previous employers. Chelsea, coincidentally, will be the first opponents of this oil-rich new era at &quot;Middle Eastlands&quot; today, when it is safe to say City&apos;s supporters will raucously remind Roman Abramovich there is a new force to be reckoned with. Tea-towels will be taped around foreheads, Monopoly money thrown into the air. There cannot be a fancy-dress shop in Manchester that still has an Arab costume in stock. As Richard Dunne observed this week, these are &quot;bleedin&apos; surreal&quot; times. Ben Haim has also been caught up in the euphoria of the moment, of seeing a player of Robinho&apos;s fame join the revolution, of wondering who might be next and where it will take the club. Yet it is also fair to say there have been other matters for him to consider too. He was in Tel Aviv when news of the Abu Dhabi United Group&apos;s takeover broke and, as he tried to focus on his country&apos;s World Cup qualifiers against Switzerland and Moldova, the Israeli media started to speculate that an Arab-owned club that was using the Premier League to promote Abu Dhabi would have little room for the Israeli international. The concerns are legitimate given that the United Arab Emirates do not recognise Israel and Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling Al Nahyan family was prominently involved in a centre that reputedly hosted anti-Semitic speakers a few years ago. Yet Ben Haim says: &quot;I don&apos;t think it should be a problem. I have just left a club that has a Jewish owner. Now I&apos;m playing a club that has Arab owners. But we&apos;re talking about professional football here. If I&apos;m playing well I should be in the team. If I&apos;m not, I won&apos;t. It&apos;s a professional club and I don&apos;t see it making any difference. It shouldn&apos;t have any influence on my career whatsoever.&quot; Point made, the 26-year-old from Rishon LeZion is entitled to hope that is the last he has heard of it. The Jewish Telegraph has questioned whether his time at City is coming to an &quot;abrupt end&quot;. But the man himself does not want to prolong the debate, preferring to concentrate on resuscitating his career after what, by his own admission, was a wasted year at Stamford Bridge. &quot;The important thing for me is that I have the opportunity to start playing football regularly again,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m enjoying myself at City and I want to make up for lost time because, at Chelsea, I was denied that chance. That was very difficult for me but I want to look forward rather than back. So Chelsea is history to me. City is all that matters.&quot; And the aim, ultimately, is worldwide domination. That quickly became clear to Ben Haim on that manic Monday when City&apos;s new owners scattered bids totalling almost \u00a3200m around Europe for just about every fantasy-footballer they could think of, eventually hitting the jackpot with Robinho, at a British record \u00a332.5m. &quot;They clearly want to invest huge sums of money into making us much bigger and much better,&quot; says Ben Haim. &quot;And there is the potential here. Look at the fan base, the stadium, the facilities. I just hope the new owners can give this team a real push. The club is trying to build something very special. There are great players here already and the gaffer [Mark Hughes]is not going to buy players just for the sake of buying them. He wants to buy the best players. It&apos;s exciting for everyone.&quot; Ben Haim&apos;s own transfer fee was a relatively modest \u00a35m or, to put it another way, the kind of money that Sheikh Mansour and his friends probably keep down the back of the settee. The defender had been a popular member of the Chelsea dressing room but, after signing on a Bosman free transfer from Bolton Wanderers, he will remember his time in west London with little affection. &quot;I signed for Jose Mourinho but he was gone very early in the season and, after that, it was very difficult for me,&quot; he says. &quot;When I left Bolton I could have gone to Newcastle to work with a man I love very much, Sam Allardyce. I chose Chelsea because they are one of the best clubs in the world and I wanted to play in the Champions League with some of the best players in the world. But then a new manager [Avram Grant] took over. He did not want to play me and there was nothing I could do about it. It&apos;s that simple.&quot; His relationship with Grant deteriorated to the point where, in April, Ben Haim went public with his grievances, using The Sun as his platform to claim, &quot;I knew nothing good would come for me with Grant as coach&quot;. Chelsea responded by saying he would be fined although no money was ever taken off him. &quot;I was frustrated,&quot; Ben Haim remembers. &quot;If you don&apos;t feel frustrated when you don&apos;t play, there is something wrong with you. If you&apos;re not disappointed, you need to start looking for a different job. &quot;For me, it was very hard to accept. Everywhere round the world it is the same - the manager chooses the team and you can&apos;t do anything about it. But when you have given your life to football, when you have worked for it ever since you were a little boy and you hardly think about anything else, it made me very unhappy. I would come home after training, not feeling the same person. I would go to the gym every day and try to work off some of the frustration. I&apos;d get on the running machine and start going faster and faster, getting it all out. But it was always on my mind. That feeling after games, knowing you have helped the team, the joy when you have won - I missed that so much. And I knew I had to find another club.&quot; He had made up his mind before Luiz Felipe Scolari was appointed to replace Grant. But he was never tempted to leave England. &quot;For me, the Premier League is the best in the world. Plus I really like the culture in England. It&apos;s very different to Israel. The people here are very polite. In Israel - how can I describe it? - everyone is always beeping their car horns. It&apos;s a lot warmer over there and people get hot and upset. It&apos;s beep, beep, beep! Plus they are upset about the [political] situation. That situation is better now but the people are still not as relaxed as here.&quot; He and his wife, Michal, and their baby boy, Ori, have quickly settled in Manchester. &quot;There is a big Jewish community here. It feels like an extended family. There is always someone to help if you need it. It&apos;s not always like that in London.&quot; Hughes, however, has a player who is determined to prove a point to Chelsea. &quot;My father [Imanuel] is 58 yet he still plays, five against five, every Friday and Saturday night,&quot; says Ben Haim. &quot;You can tell whether he has won or lost as soon as he walks through the door. We just look at his face! And that&apos;s the way I am too. I take football very seriously. I give my heart in every game.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-09-12T23:01:00Z", "title": "Premier League: Manchester City's Tal Ben Haim can dare to dream again", "sentences": ["He was in Tel Aviv when news of the Abu Dhabi United Group&apos;s takeover broke and, as he tried to focus on his country&apos;s World Cup qualifiers against Switzerland and Moldova, the Israeli media started to speculate that an Arab-owned club that was using the Premier League to promote Abu Dhabi would have little room for the Israeli international."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/13/manchestercity.premierleague"}, {"tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "Jasmin Vardimon Company Corn Exchange, Brighton This autumn Israeli choreographers are everywhere. Hofesh Shechter launches a UK tour on Tuesday, Emanuel Gat Dance opens at Sadler&apos;s Wells in London on Friday, and Ohad Naharin and the Batsheva Company arrive in London next month as part of Dance Umbrella.  Jasmin Vardimon, whose new work, Yesterday, premiered in Brighton last week, was born in Israel in 1971. She decided that her future lay in performance when she was 14, and her dance-class was drafted to cover a Tel Aviv stage with pink carnations for a performance of Pina Bausch&apos;s Nelken. After working for several years with the Kibbutz Dance Company, Vardimon moved to Britain and in 1997 formed her own ensemble. Since then she has produced a series of dance-theatre pieces which turn an unsparing but ultimately compassionate eye on contemporary human behaviour. Her best-known piece is probably the darkly suggestive Lullaby (2004), which is set in a hospital and was inspired by her father&apos;s death from cancer. Yesterday takes the form of a 10-year retrospective, and unites elements of several works: long-term Vardimonistas will recognise reworked scenes from Justitia (2007), Park (2005), Lullaby and Ticklish (2001), among others. The piece opens with a female dancer, YunKrung Song, standing on the feet of a man who is lying on his back. She is holding a fishing rod with a camera attached, with which she films the audience. It&apos;s a typically space-disrupting image: cinematography plays a large part in Vardimon&apos;s work. In the following sequence Song walks towards a static camera. Her face is projected, hugely enlarged, on to the cyclorama. The camera then explores her body, following the path of a marker pen with which she maps it out. Later she draws a house and windows on her belly, and other performers appear at the magnified windows and doors behind her. She smears the image on her body and the stage fills with smoke. The house is on fire. Panic. Passages like these sail close to whimsy but Vardimon keeps a purposeful hand on the tiller. Sequences are launched as comedy, as when Luke Burrough lectures the audience on disease control and Mafalda Deville zooms around the stage as an out-of-control virus, and then suddenly turns violent as he assaults and crushes her. Combative relationships abound. Christine Gouzelis flirts with Tim Casson, whose romantic enthusiasm turns to terror when she begins to physically devour him, burying her head in his track-pants. A solo by Casson is violently interrupted by Burrough, who bursts on to the stage with a megaphone. &apos;I believe that a man should not dance in public,&apos; he bellows, introducing a manic display of National Front-style flag-waving extracted from Park Vardimon has a clear political and feminist agenda but a deft theatrical touch softens the agitprop edges. Her dance-making skills have developed over the years and so, vitally, has her preparedness to cut her work back to essentials. Tableaux unfold, flare for a moment, and are washed away on a tide of rhythmic, low-trajectory choreography. A beautiful, Bausch-like section from Lullaby sees the dancers in a rocking sea of feathers. While synthesising Vardimon&apos;s past work, Yesterday is also a meditation on the subject of memory, and as such brings a certain poignancy to the piece&apos;s bare-knuckle challenge.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-13T23:01:00Z", "title": "Dance review: Jasmin Vardimon Company / Corn Exchange, Brighton", "sentences": ["She decided that her future lay in performance when she was 14, and her dance-class was drafted to cover a Tel Aviv stage with pink carnations for a performance of Pina Bausch&apos;s Nelken."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/14/dance"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "GB basketball"], "article": "A single win for Great Britain&apos;s men&apos;s team in their final week of European qualifying - away to the Czech Republic or Bosnia - should be enough to book a place in next year&apos;s finals in Poland.

He was responsible for initiating an illicit campaign of bombing and sabotage against western targets in Egypt, and, having been forced to resign, he later admitted having forged documents that falsely implicated his boss, the Israeli defence minister Pinhas Lavon, in the plot. The affair had major repercussions on two fronts. In Egypt, it arguably fuelled the 1956 Suez crisis, and hastened the departure from the country of 50,000 Jews, who came to be seen as a fifth column. In Israel, it forced the resignation of Lavon, sparked a crisis in the ruling Labour party involving key figures such as Shimon Peres and Moshe Dayan, emboldened Israel&apos;s press and ultimately demolished the career of the former premier David Ben-Gurion.  The Lavon affair had its origins in Israeli concerns in the early 1950s that the US was becoming too friendly with Egypt&apos;s charismatic young leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, seeing him as a potential bastion against Russia. Having failed to influence US policy through diplomatic means, Gibli and his circle initiated a bombing campaign in Egypt, codenamed Operation Shoshana (Susannah), in the hope that the chaos it wrought would be blamed on local communists or the Muslim Brotherhood threatening counter-revolution. Washington, they reasoned, would then shun Nasser as weak. They also hoped that Britain might shelve plans to shut its military base at Suez, which Israel regarded as a useful defensive bulwark. But Shoshana backfired spectacularly. In early July 1954, homemade bombs were left at a post office in Alexandria, the US Information Agency libraries in Alexandria and Cairo, and a British-owned theatre. But they did little damage and caused no injuries. Then, on July 23, a device being carried to the Rio Cinema in Alexandria exploded in the agent&apos;s pocket, and he and 10 other suspects were arrested and put on trial. All the indications suggested that the Egyptian authorities knew in advance what was happening. Two of the accused were hanged: one committed suicide and another died during interrogation. The remaining captives were released only in 1968 in a prisoner exchange following the six-day war, and it was not until 2005 that Israel admitted responsibility for the affair and honoured the Egyptian Jewish agents involved. Gibli resigned in March 1955, two months after his boss Lavon, who had accused him of perjury, forgery, insubordination and criminal negligence. Much later, however, Gibli&apos;s former secretary revealed that a document supposedly signed by Lavon and sent by Gibli to Dayan was indeed a forgery. In 1960, Lavon was finally absolved of any involvement in the bombing campaign. Gibli was born in Petah Tikva, near what is now Tel Aviv, four years after his parents arrived in Palestine from Bryansk, in western Russia. A member of the Haganah militia, from 1941 to 1944 he worked for the British Mandate police. In 1948, during the Israeli war of independence, he headed the police intelligence unit in Jerusalem. That summer, he sat on a four-man tribunal that tried and sentenced to death the Haganah commander Meir Tobianski on charges of passing military information to Jordan and Britain. Tobianski, a former officer in the Royal Corps of Engineers and employee of the British-run Jerusalem Electricity Company, was posthumously cleared. The chairman of the court was jailed for manslaughter, but Gibli avoided prosecution. In 1950 he became head of the Israeli military intelligence force, Aman, and promptly ignited a turf war with the Israeli foreign ministry and the intelligence service Mossad by trying to extend Aman&apos;s remit to all foreign operations. The following year he set up a network of secret units, including unit 131, with sleeper cells in Alexandria and Cairo, who were later responsible for Shoshana. Avri Elad (formerly Abraham Seidenberg), who took over the running of unit 131 but was later jailed for 10 years for selling secrets to Egypt, insisted at his trial that Gibli, not Lavon, had given the order for action. The signal, he said, was a radio broadcast of an English cake recipe. After his resignation, Gibli remained in the Israel defence forces and commanded the Golani Brigade in Gaza during the 1956 Suez war. He then served as Israeli military attach\u00e9 in Scandinavia and London, where he was in 1960 when news of his forgery broke. He finally admitted the sham and was fired from the military.  He later headed a car manufacturer and the Israel Electric Corporation. His brother Avshalom swore that he was always haunted by the Tobianski trial and the Lavon affair.

If she wins and forms a government, she would be the first female prime minister since Golda Meir resigned in 1974. However, analysts warned that the vote would be difficult to call. Polls are open until late tonight, and a result is not expected before early tomorrow. If one candidate wins more than 40% of the vote, they will then be given 42 days to form a coalition government. If no coalition is agreed then new elections must be held within three months.  Until then, the prime minister, Ehud Olmert - who is facing several corruption investigations and has promised to resign after the vote - would probably stay on as a caretaker. Around 74,000 members of Kadima are eligible to vote, and a low turnout might favour Mofaz, whose campaign is thought to have been better organised.  Israel&apos;s Ynet news website said only 28% of voters had turned out by 6pm local time, but more were expected for the last four hours of voting. Livni voted in Tel Aviv and encouraged others to turn out, saying: &quot;You can determine today what the character of Kadima will be.&quot;  &quot;You can determine today if you really have had enough of old-time politics. Come and vote, bring your children, and show them how you are changing the country.&quot; Mofaz, as he has often done in recent weeks, emphasised his security background as a former general and defence minister.  &quot;The state of Israel stands before major challenges in the coming years and needs a strong leader who has the courage to decide and the ability to act,&quot; he told Israeli Army Radio.  On Sunday, he predicted he would win the vote, even promising to take the election with exactly 43%. One of the most recent polls, carried out for the Ma&apos;ariv newspaper on Monday, suggested the gap between the two leading contenders was shrinking but still put Livni well ahead on 42.5% against Mofaz on 30.4%.  The two other candidates, the internal security minister, Avi Dichter, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are a long way behind. If none of the candidates reaches 40%, a run-off vote will be held next week. Although Livni, 50, and 59-year-old Mofaz are from the same party, there are marked differences in their views.  Livni has been closely involved in the last year of negotiations with the Palestinians, and is expected to continue the process if she wins. She argues in favour of a Palestinian state, but is adamantly opposed to the return of a single Palestinian refugee into what is now Israel.  Mofaz has been much more sceptical about the idea of talks with the Palestinians - last week he told an Israeli newspaper the negotiations had been a &quot;waste of time&quot; - but supports the idea of a two-state solution to the conflict.  He has also taken a much tougher line on Iran and its nuclear ambitions, saying earlier this year that he thought war was &quot;unavoidable&quot;. Some Israeli commentators have been distinctly unimpressed. Sima Kadmon, writing in today&apos;s Yedioth Ahronoth, said she thought both lacked charisma and leadership ability.  &quot;It is not an easy choice.

Exit polls put Livni ahead of her closest rival, Shaul Mofaz, the hawkish transport minister and former army chief. Livni, a former Mossad agent and lawyer, now has six weeks to put together a coalition government. If she succeeds - and her large margin of victory will help - she will become Israel&apos;s first female prime minister since Golda Meir resigned in 1974. If she fails, general elections will be held within three months. There were cheers at Kadima&apos;s headquarters when exit polls from Israel&apos;s three main television networks gave Livni between 47% and 49% of the vote, against 37% for Mofaz. The two other candidates, Avi Dichter, the internal security minister, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, were a long way behind. With about half of the actual votes counted early this morning, Livni had won 47% and Mofaz 41%, party officials told Israel Radio. She needed 40% to avoid a runoff next week. Minutes after the voting ended, Livni telephoned her party workers at their Tel Aviv headquarters to congratulate them. &quot;We fought like lions, against many opportunists, and you were simply amazing ... The good guys won,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you did it as friends, but like me you did it because you want this to be a better place.&quot; Later, her predecessor Ehud Olmert, the prime minister, who is expected to resign in the days ahead, phoned to congratulate her. In the leadership contest Livni, 50, took a less hard line than Mofaz and won support for that across the party, at a time when Israeli public opinion has shifted to the right. She pitched herself as a candidate who would bring a fresh face to Israeli politics. &quot;You can determine today what the character of Kadima will be. You can determine today if you really have had enough of old-time politics,&quot; she said as she cast her vote yesterday in Tel Aviv. &quot;Come and vote, bring your children, and show them how you are changing the country.&quot; Her first hurdle will be forming a coalition. Some in the Labour party, which has been a key element of the Kadima-led coalition, suggested they might reconsider staying in the government, while leaders of the smaller religious Shas party made it clear they would be pressing hard for new child allowances, a key policy that appeals to their voters. Kadima itself is only three years old - the party was formed by Ariel Sharon, then prime minister, who walked away from the Likud party and took his supporters with him, among them Livni. Livni has been closely involved in the last year of talks with the Palestinians, acting as Israel&apos;s lead negotiator, and she is expected to continue those talks if she becomes prime minister, adopting a more dovish stance than some colleagues. &quot;I am really happy that Livni won because she is committed to the peace process,&quot; said Israeli peace activist Yossi Beilin. &quot;I think the right thing for her to do now is to form a coalition that wants to promote peace rather than a broad government with the right.&quot; Palestinian leaders also seemed pleased with the result. &quot;Because Livni was immersed in the peace process, we believe she will pursue peace moves with us,&quot; said Ahmed Qureia, the chief Palestinian negotiator. But some Israeli commentators have been unimpressed with the entire contest, talking of a lack of vision. Sima Kadmon, writing in today&apos;s Yedioth Ahronoth, said she thought both Livni and Mofaz lacked charisma and leadership ability. &quot;It is not an easy choice.

Since the 1990s, efforts to reach a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been going round and round in vicious circles, while the situation on the ground has been deteriorating constantly. There is no shortage of thorny practical issues \u2013 from the question of Palestinian refugees to final borders \u2013 standing in the way of a deal, not to mention the power disparity between the two sides, but what role does rigid religious or pseudo-religious ideology play in perpetuating the struggle? To get an idea, we need to rewind to the most hopeful period of the Oslo years. Finally at ease in his role as a dove, Yitzhak Rabin, the one-time hawk, soared on the wings of the biggest mass demonstration in Israeli history. &quot;This rally must send a message to the Israeli public, to the Jews of the world, to the multitudes in the Arab lands and in the world at large,&quot; he urged the 150,000-strong crowd that had turned out to hear him speak in Tel Aviv, &quot;that the nation of Israel wants peace&quot;. The message was apparently all too clear to the hawks that had been circling around him ever since he had decided to talk directly to his former arch-enemies, Yasser Arafat and the PLO. On that autumn night, November 4, 1995, Rabin paid for his &quot;betrayal&quot; with his life. His assassination sent shockwaves across the country, the region and the world, with that rare spectacle of Arabs expressing grief for a slain Israeli politician. The killer was Yigal Amir, a university student who was a far-right religious Zionist. After his arrest, he told police he had acted on &quot;the orders of God&quot;. Reflecting the distrust and hate elicited among the settler movement, Amir confessed to a later commission of inquiry: &quot;I felt as if I was shooting a terrorist.&quot;  Although religious and revisionist Zionists quickly distanced themselves from the murder, many Israelis are convinced that, even if Amir pulled the trigger, the extremists provided him with the ideological ammo. The settler movement had accused Rabin of planning to withdraw to &quot;Auschwitz borders&quot; and Orthodox rabbis had called on soldiers to disobey any orders to evacuate any part of the West Bank. Rabin&apos;s grieving widow, Leah, refused to shake hands with the Likud&apos;s Binyamin Netanyahu, one of the staunchest and most vitriolic opponents of Rabin&apos;s peace overtures, but shook Arafat&apos;s hand. &quot;I feel that we can find a common language with the Arabs more easily than we can with the Jewish extremists,&quot; she said. The Likud and other revisionist Zionists, the right-wing religious parties and the settler movement oppose the peace process because they advocate the annexation and settlement of the whole of Eretz Israel (Land of Israel), the vaguely-defined Biblical territory which God &quot;promised&quot; to Abraham. &quot;Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel,&quot; reads the Likud party&apos;s platform. Even the ostensibly more pragmatic religious party, Shas, which is vaguely in favour of making some concessions to the Palestinians, advocates the &quot;Greater Israel&quot; enterprise. Despite his &quot;fatwa&quot; that the sanctity of human lives is more important than that of the land, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas&apos;s spiritual leader, instructed his men to leave Rabin&apos;s government in protest against the Oslo accords and, again in July 2000, the rabbi withdrew Shas from Ehud Barak&apos;s government to undermine the Camp David summit. But it is not just extremist Israelis who believe they own a divine deed to the land, Palestinian Islamists, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad possess the inverse view. According to Hamas&apos;s 1988 charter, &quot;Palestine has been an Islamic Waqf (endowment) throughout the generations and until the Day of Resurrection, no one can renounce it or part of it, or abandon it or part of it.&quot; Unsurprisingly then, Hamas \u2013 created during the first intifada as a reaction to the increasingly oppressive Israeli occupation and the increasing willingness of Palestinian secularists to reach an accommodation with Israel \u2013 was incensed by Oslo and started a suicide bombing campaign to undermine the process. This, coupled with the death toll and humiliation inflicted by the Israeli military on the Palestinian population, sought to chip away at public confidence in the peace process on both sides and to restore mutual distrust. An Arabic proverb talks of people who kill and then lead the funeral procession. And that is what the extremists seem to be on the verge of doing with the two-state solution. On the Israeli side, Rabin&apos;s murder marked the beginning of the end for the moderates and pragmatists. A shaken Shimon Peres was unable to regain momentum and shot himself in the foot with his Grapes of Wrath invasion of Lebanon, and the election of Binyamin Netanyahu sounded the final death knell for the Oslo process. On the Palestinian side, the continued failure of the Palestinian Authority to deliver an independent state, as well as its endemic corruption, strengthened the hand of the extremists, propelling Hamas to a series of local election victories, crowned by their success in the 2006 parliamentary elections. Israeli and Palestinian extremists achieved this by having the unshakable drive and conviction \u2013 one could say &quot;delusion&quot; --\u2013 to take advantage of the fractured political landscape, by preying on the fear and distrust of the enemy, and by hoodwinking the electorate. For instance, Hamas dropped the call for the destruction of Israel from its election manifesto prior to the 2006 election, while Netanyahu promised to respect the peace process and deliver &quot;peace with security&quot;. What the extremists have been unable to answer is what to do with the elephant in the room: the millions from the &quot;enemy camp&quot;? How do they achieve their fantasies of territorial maximalism without having to oppress an entire people permanently, which is impossible? Neither Jewish nor Palestinian extremists are likely to abandon their ultimate dreams easily, but there are signs that they can be pushed to become more practical and pragmatic. Ariel Sharon, the die-hard warhorse, broke away from the Likud he founded to take a somewhat more pragmatic path with his new Kadima party. The responsibilities of office have shown that Hamas can be more accommodating than its past suggests, with the Islamist party indicating its willingness to end its armed struggle with Israel in return for a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borders. Unfortunately, the Israelis and international community have failed to engage with Hamas. Despite the best efforts of the extremists, the Israeli and Palestinian public still crave peace, as poll after poll confirms, but agreeing a fair price for it is the challenge. The Oslo process had many faults: its fixation on Israel&apos;s short-term security and its vagueness on the shape and form of a Palestinian state; accelerated settlement building, as well as the deferral of all the thorny issues to the final status talks. However, given the current hopeless mess, one cannot help feel a window of opportunity closed with Rabin&apos;s assassination. Had Rabin lived, the final status talks which were due to start on May 4, 1996, may have led somewhere, rather becoming an empty shell. After all, six months earlier, with Rabin and Arafat&apos;s blessing, a blueprint for a mutually acceptable deal was hammered out in secret talks under the auspices of Yossi Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas.  The two-state solution is on life-support and if it is to be saved, the passive majority must mobilise in opposition to those who continuously veto the quest for peace by invoking God.

Mikhail, who is reluctant to give her full name, had scandalised members of her ultra-orthodox Jewish community by leaving her husband and embracing a secular lifestyle. The men, all members of the theologically conservative Haredi branch of Judaism, tackled her to the ground, slammed her head against the floor and tied a rag around her mouth. One assailant sat on her head as the others kicked her while demanding to know the names of the men she was seeing. They also threatened to kill her if she did not leave the neighbourhood, which contains many secular as well as religious residents. &apos;A woman is only OK if she has a family, kids and a husband,&apos; said Mikhail with a sigh. Welcome to the new, increasingly orthodox, Jerusalem. The attack on Mikhail, although exceptionally brutal, was only the latest in a string of assaults over the past two years against Jewish women accused of immoral behaviour in the city. In relative terms, Orthodox Jews dominate Jerusalem to a greater extent than in any other city in Israel. More than 30 per cent of its Jewish residents are Haredi while only 22 per cent are secular. Of the remaining 47 per cent, 14 per cent say they are religious and 33 per cent say they are traditional Jews. According to Menachem Friedman, a sociology professor at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv, the orthodox are imposing their rules more forcefully than before and the lives of the city&apos;s women are becoming more circumscribed, and sometimes more dangerous, as a result. Friedman grew up in an ultra-orthodox family and has been studying the Haredi for 49 years. He said the extreme atmosphere is tangible. Self-appointed moral guardians, dubbed the &apos;modesty police&apos; by Israel&apos;s modern secular media, roam Jerusalem&apos;s ultra-religious neighbourhoods enforcing the voluminous and ever growing list of rabbinical laws such as the recent decree banning the sale of MP4 players. About 100 Haredi women have taken to wearing scarves and veils to cover themselves much like Muslim women. Yoel Kreus is known locally in the Mea Shearim area of the city as the &apos;manager of operations&apos;. He describes himself as a &apos;shmira&apos;, a Hebrew word that translates as &apos;watcher of Israel&apos;. &apos;I make sure the rabbis&apos; decisions happen ... I help you to be a moral person,&apos; he said. Much of Kreus&apos;s time is spent checking out reports of illicit use of new technologies by members of the Haredi community. &apos;If we discover someone has a computer at home we throw the children out of school,&apos; he said. Enforcing dictates on women&apos;s behaviour is another vital part of his brief. He runs a library housing copies of the enormous notices pasted on the walls of Mea Shearim and other religious neighbourhoods berating women for wearing wigs instead of scarves and advertising appropriate dress on buses. Signs warning women not to enter if they are wearing trousers, short sleeves or a skirt above the knees, hang in the neighbourhood. One is affixed outside Kreus&apos;s two-room house where he lives with his wife and 11 children. &apos;Every week there&apos;s a complaint about the way women dress,&apos; said Kreus. Extraordinarily, he admitted to slashing the tyres of women who have driven into the neighbourhood who, he said, were indecently dressed. &apos;There was a mess with the police,&apos; he said. &apos;Now I&apos;m trying new creative methods, not using violence. Now I make a small hole in their tyres and the air deflates slowly. I&apos;m not destroying their car.&apos; Inside the Haredi neighbourhoods separation between the sexes is becoming increasingly strict. Husbands and wives socialise separately and during Jewish holidays men and women walk on opposite sides of the street. Kreus said that in a few weeks, when religious Jews will dance to celebrate the receiving of the Torah, men and women would rejoice separately, breaking a 50- year tradition of the sexes mingling in this neighbourhood during this event. He maintained that separation was necessary beyond the boundaries of the neighbourhood. &apos;Having secular people on the buses is a problem. They go like animals, without clothes. Non-religious girls don&apos;t dress properly. They encourage me to sin,&apos; he said. With the demographics skewed in their favour, government authorities are acquiescing to the growing demands of the ultra-orthodox. The transport ministry, which regulates and funds bus transport through private companies, has allowed operators to provide &apos;kosher&apos; or &apos;pure&apos; routes, where women are required to sit at the back and cannot board unless appropriately dressed. More than a dozen women have filed complaints after being verbally or physically attacked on the buses. &apos;Sometimes it&apos;s an official group but often it&apos;s one or two men who start to complain and the other men follow,&apos; said the Israel Religious Action Centre&apos;s legal director, Einat Hurvitz. &apos;The drivers allow them to intimidate the women.&apos; Haredi women also participated in the bullying. &apos;I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved T-shirt and as I was getting on the bus someone told me I couldn&apos;t get on the bus like that,&apos; said Iris Yoffe who was travelling from Jerusalem to her parents&apos; home in the northern city of Haifa. &apos;I ignored him and paid the driver.&apos; But then, said Yoffe, two women blocked her way and told her to get off. &apos;When I refused they started yelling at me.&apos; According to Friedman, the growing intolerance is only likely to worsen. &apos;They&apos;ve built an imaginary idealistic world where everyone is pious.&apos; Increasingly, Jewish women in Jerusalem are required to conform to that vision.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-20T23:01:00Z", "title": "Jewish 'ultras' defend morals with menace in Jerusalem", "sentences": ["According to Menachem Friedman, a sociology professor at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv, the orthodox are imposing their rules more forcefully than before and the lives of the city&apos;s women are becoming more circumscribed, and sometimes more dangerous, as a result."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/21/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The Beatles", "Cliff Richard", "Music", "Culture", "World news"], "article": "Forty-two years after Israel banned John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr from playing to the nation, the truth about its Beatlephobia has finally been revealed. Still reeling from the sight of Israeli teenagers swooning to the tunes of Cliff Richard in 1963, Israel&apos;s publicly appointed guardians of good taste and morality, the interdepartmental committee for authorising the importation of foreign artists, refused their entry. Determined to prevent another outbreak of mass hysteria, the 13 member committee of politicians and civil servants whose job it was to assess the artistic merit of foreign acts resolved to be &quot;vigilant&quot;. As a result, the 1964 request to bring to Israel, the Rhythm Beatles - as they were called in Hebrew - was roundly rejected in the committee&apos;s resolution 691, which reads: &quot;Resolved: Not to allow the request for fear that the performances by the Beatles are liable to have a negative influence on the [country&apos;s] youth.&quot; The promoters appealed against the decision, so the committee launched a global investigation of the awesome foursome. After soliciting information from Israeli embassies and the foreign ministry&apos;s cultural relations department, it discovered that the world was afflicted with Beatlemania. Israel&apos;s media lambasted the group, urging the committee to protect the nation&apos;s youth as Cliff Richard had already given them &quot;a bad name&quot;. One paper reported that committee members had been listening to the &quot;yeah-yeah-yeah howls which are capable of striking dead a real beetle&quot;. Another reported the head of the education ministry as saying: &quot;There is no musical or artistic experience here but a sensual display that arouses feelings of aggression replete with sexual stimuli.&quot; At the conclusion of its inquiry, the committee wrote, in resolution 709, that it would refuse entry because &quot;the band has no artistic merit&quot; and its performances &quot;cause hysteria and mass disorder among young people&quot;. Several versions of the story, blaming the then prime minister, Golda Meir, a former education minister who had never heard of the Beatles, a jealous promoter who regretted turning down the Beatles for Richard, and even the finance ministry for allegedly refusing to allot the foreign currency required to underwrite the performance, have lingered. But when the Israeli ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, gave an official letter of apology to John Lennon&apos;s half-sister this year, Alon Gan, a history professor at Tel Aviv University, was inspired to investigate. Gan, who revealed the story in the daily newspaper Haaretz, one week before McCartney is due to perform for the first time in the country, said the true story was that &quot;Israel in the early 60s was afraid that from the west would come a bad wind of sex, alcohol and rock&apos;n&apos;roll&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-21T23:01:00Z", "title": "Truth after 42 years: Beatles banned for fear of influence on youth", "sentences": ["But when the Israeli ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, gave an official letter of apology to John Lennon&apos;s half-sister this year, Alon Gan, a history professor at Tel Aviv University, was inspired to investigate."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/israelandthepalestinians.thebeatles"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Paul McCartney"], "article": "Ben White to Alex Stein Firstly, thank you for agreeing to this debate. Since space is limited, I&apos;ll jump straight in.  I believe that Paul McCartney&apos;s concert should not go ahead, firstly on account of Israel &apos;s ongoing crimes against the Palestinians, and secondly, because I believe that a boycott plays an effective role in a wider campaign for a just peace in Palestine and Israel. (I&apos;d like to add that while someone might disagree with the first premise \u2013 and hence consider the boycott ridiculous or sinister \u2013 it&apos;s possible to agree with this assessment of Israel &apos;s past and present, but consider a boycott to be tactically flawed.) McCartney will play in Tel Aviv&apos;s Hayarkon Park, on the site of a Palestinian village destroyed in 1948. There are hundreds of such spots all over Israel, a &quot;ghost map&quot; of communities emptied of the unwanted Arab population who remain refugees. The ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine 1948 that made it possible to create a Zionist state are not simply history. Israel continues its efforts to erase Palestine from the map; like in the occupied territories, where an apartheid regime of privileges separates Israelis from the stateless Palestinians. Dismantling this regime is the way to create a peaceful tomorrow for Jews and Palestinians. As Israel continues to show no desire to voluntarily withdraw or surrender its power, a boycott is just one tactic in this struggle. McCartney should stay away. Alex to Ben Ben, thanks for kicking things off. I oppose the idea that McCartney should boycott Israel. At the same time, I think an artist&apos;s conscience should play a role in where she or he plays. The question before us, then, is what should McCartney&apos;s conscience dictate he do? I&apos;m more interested in what&apos;s effective than what&apos;s right or wrong. What can McCartney do to improve the situation according to the wishes of the Israeli and Palestinian populations on the ground? Practically this means what can McCartney do to advance the cause of a two-state solution along the lines of the Geneva initiative? We know this is the desired outcome, because poll after poll shows that between two-thirds and three-quarters of Israelis and Palestinians support such a solution. (I&apos;m not dogmatically opposed to some sort of &quot;one-state&quot; solution, by the way. The moment the people of the land support it, I won&apos;t be one of those standing in their way.) How can McCartney do his little bit to work towards this outcome? Luckily, we already have precedent. Roger Waters of Pink Floyd (how I wish this debate concerned New York rappers instead of ageing rockers!), after the inevitable pressure from the pro and anti-boycott lobbies, decided to perform at Neve Shalom-Wahat al-Salam, a village jointly established by Jewish and Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel. He also demonstrated his opposition to the separation barrier. Surely this is the most effective course of action? Come to the country, engage with the local population, do your bit to encourage them to learn to live in peace. By boycotting you simply miss the chance to have an impact. This is why I disagree with your claim that a boycott plays an effective role in the campaign for a wider peace, although I&apos;d be interested to hear you spell out precisely what that wider peace would look like and what steps Israel would have to take for the boycott to be ended. Ben to Alex I&apos;d like to begin by pointing out what I felt you didn&apos;t respond to from my initial email: the description of Israel&apos;s land theft and ethnic cleansing of Palestine, past and present. This despite it being the foundational reason for the pro-boycott argument I laid out. You do say, however, that you&apos;re &quot;more interested in what&apos;s effective than what&apos;s right or wrong&quot;. This can seem like you either dispute the reality of Israeli discrimination since 1948, or even, that you&apos;re not sure whether it is &quot;right or wrong&quot;. I was also interested that you based a significant part of your reply on the apparent support amongst Israelis and Palestinians for the Geneva accord. There are two problems with this tack. Firstly, it means the approach rests almost entirely on unspecified polling data, which is then used as cast-iron proof of what a majority of both peoples want, and thus what we should all be working towards. But secondly, even if the Geneva accord was the holy grail, this still wouldn&apos;t mean that concerts and &quot;engagement&quot; are the right way forward. That&apos;s because Israel is completely unwilling to allow a sovereign Palestine to emerge in the occupied territories. Colonisation continues apace, settlements are integrated into Israel&apos;s infrastructure, and international law is laughed at daily. &quot;Coexistence&quot; concerts can only provide theme music for subordinate, colonial &quot;autonomy&quot;; not usher in independence.  (Incidentally, I haven&apos;t taken up your invitation to &quot;spell out precisely&quot; what a wider peace would look like, as I thought that it is not really the specific focus of this debate \u2013 plus relevant thoughts of mine are readable elsewhere.) Alex to Ben I didn&apos;t deal with the issue of Israel&apos;s creation because there isn&apos;t much room to discuss it constructively in such a short space. Suffice to say that I disagree with the claim that Israel was founded on ethnic cleansing. Am I to take from your emphasis on 1948 that Israel would have to return to the pre-partition days (right of return as well) for the boycott to end? If that&apos;s the case, I wish you luck. This is what Noam Chomsky calls the politics of Mars, while in the real world, suffering continues. Either way, it&apos;s crucial that you state absolutely clearly what steps Israel would have to take for your support of the boycott to end, both for the readers&apos; benefit and for mine. The issue of &quot;right or wrong&quot;: Even if you could demonstrate to me that encouraging McCarthy to boycott Israel was somehow morally appropriate, you would then have to prove it to be an effective strategy. I would dispute that. Israelis aren&apos;t particularly reliant on foreigners for their entertainment. There&apos;s a vibrant home-grown scene in all aspects of the arts \u2013 music, theatre, literature \u2013 testament to the extraordinary revival of the Hebrew language. If McCartney decided not to come for political reasons, the Israeli population would collectively shrug its shoulders. They would ask &quot;Why is Israel the only country he has decided to boycott?&quot; and then carry on with their lives. Geneva accords: polls aren&apos;t cast-iron. But they have repeatedly shown clear majority support for some sort of two-state solution. Your line about a concert at Neve Shalom being &quot;theme music&quot; is cute, but inaccurate. What is more likely to change hearts and minds? McCartney playing Neve Shalom and calling on 50,000 people to take real steps to give Palestinians a genuine, sovereign state, or signing up to the PACBI letter? As Chomsky has stated, the choice is between the politics of Mars and the politics of the real world.  Ben to Alex Inevitably, there are two different emphases that have developed here: one, related to Israel&apos;s history and what a just solution would look like, and two, the usefulness or otherwise of the boycott. It&apos;s revealing that for you, an &quot;emphasis on 1948&quot; seems worthy of comment. Such a reference point would go without saying for Palestinians: expelled 60 years ago, they watched as their land disappeared under new Jewish towns and picnic parks, unreachable behind barriers, gun barrels, and a web of discriminatory legislation. Of course, it&apos;s not actually about returning to a vanished past, except in the sense of acknowledging what happened \u2013 which you don&apos;t. Quite simply, Palestinians should have the same rights in Palestine and Israel as Jewish Israelis do: the rights of residence, land ownership, and nationality (to name a few). All the things, in fact, they have been systematically deprived of since the foundation stones of Israeli statehood were laid on the rubble of the Nakba. The &quot;politics of Mars&quot; seems to be shorthand for ideas deemed far-fetched and impossible, conveniently fenced-off from &quot;sensible&quot; discussion. Yet once more, you appear to believe that the liberation of even the occupied territories will be advanced by McCartney mid-set &quot;calling&quot; on people to do the right thing. Like the hope that the Palestinians will &quot;recognise&quot; their own dispossession, that seems to be a far more fanciful path to peace when compared to the growing, international movement of boycott, divestment and sanctions, aimed at applying the kind of meaningful pressure Israel has so far avoided. All of this in order that Palestinian rights are finally respected and both peoples can breathe easily, removed from the suffocating grip of a colonial relationship endangering everyone concerned.Alex to Ben It&apos;s not that 1948 isn&apos;t of importance. I merely disagree with your claim that Israel is solely responsible for the fate of the Palestinians. The Palestinians chose to reject the UN partition resolution, which was the least bad solution on offer. The logic for rejecting partition is the same logic for rejecting some sort of binational solution: there wasn&apos;t much difference \u2013 in 1947 \u2013 between the argument supporting sharing a single state with the Jews and the argument supporting partitioning the land with the Jews. As Benny Morris notes, &quot;Without doubt, Arab expulsionism fuelled Zionist expulsionist thinking during the 1930s and 1940s.&quot; The few Palestinians that did support what today is called a one-state solution tended to meet a violent end. Today, a majority of the Palestinian people on the ground support a two-state solution. I do as well, although I hope that eventually a more integrated future might be possible. I support Palestinians having rights of residence in the new Palestinian state, land ownership and nationality (plus I support the right of Israeli-Palestinians to full land equality, a topic I have written about in the past).  If the Palestinians recognising their own dispossession is what you understand by their strong support for a two-state solution, so be it. I&apos;d suggest you take that up with them. In the meantime, focusing efforts on getting the likes of McCartney to boycott Israel is the worse kind of gesture politics, an alternative to the difficult task of building trust on the ground, work done admirably at places like Neve Shalom, a place you don&apos;t seem to see as fit for hosting the Beatles&apos; finest.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-24T10:30:01Z", "title": "Take two: Ben White v Alex Stein \u2013 should Paul McCartney play Israel?", "sentences": ["McCartney will play in Tel Aviv&apos;s Hayarkon Park, on the site of a Palestinian village destroyed in 1948."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Portsmouth", "Beitar Jerusalem", "Premier League"], "article": "It was almost inevitable that questions over Portsmouth&apos;s ownership arose after their 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City. Most of us would probably be too embarrassed to own up in the aftermath of such a mauling. Alas there was more than just shame at work when the credentials of Pompey&apos;s owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, were called into question this week.  No, it has nothing to do with the fact that Alexandre was, according to newspaper reports, prepared to sell the club for \u00a360m. Instead, it emerged that all might not be as it seems at Fratton Park after the Israeli tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth published a list of the assets held by Alexandre&apos;s father, the effervescent Israeli-Russian billionaire Arkadi Gaydamak. Portsmouth were listed as one of his, and not his son&apos;s, concerns. The club and, of course, the family themselves have vehemently denied the allegations, and the Premier League seems satisfied with their explanation. Yet nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Gaydamaks.  That sounds a little melodramatic, so let me explain. This is merely the latest in a long line of controversies to surround Arkadi Gaydamak. To start with there is the widely reported French arrest warrant still outstanding for alleged gun running in Angola and tax evasion. But this is only the beginning of the story, one that could end with Gaydamak Snr being elected to one of the most sensitive political posts in the Middle East. Even in Israel, little has been known about the complicated origins of the Gaydamak millions. When Arkadi burst on to the scene three years ago, purchasing Israel&apos;s biggest football team Beitar Jerusalem and bankrolling them to a title almost immediately, few questioned where the money came from.  &quot;It is a bit like in England, we don&apos;t know a lot about Sacha [Alexandre&apos;s nickname],&quot; said Shaul Adar, an Israeli journalist based in London. &quot;Does he have any money of his own? How did he get it? He came into the public domain out of nowhere, like his father. Arkadi met [life-long Beitar fan Ehud] Olmert. He asked to donate money, and the next day he was the owner [of Beitar]. In the few months he was the most famous person in Israel, he was on TV all the time and he came over quite eccentric. He was the Israeli Abramovich.&quot;  Beitar has dominated Israeli football ever since but that wasn&apos;t enough. Arkadi had political ambitions, setting up his own Social Justice party and announcing he was to stand in the November 11 Jerusalem mayoral election. His outspoken, maverick persona has more than a touch of the John McCain about it: a right-wing populist that can spring the odd surprise, indulge in some political madness and provoke grudging admiration all at the same time. His purchase of Beitar, who arguably boast one of the most racist terraces in world football, immediately hoisted his flag for the political right. This, after all, was a team whose fans regularly sung songs wishing &apos;death to the Arabs&apos; whilst refusing to accept an Arab playing for the club.  Yet he was also responsible for donating money to the Israeli Arab football team Bnei Sakhnin when they were close to going under after relegation from the Ligat Ha&apos;al. Sakhnin&apos;s chairman Mazen Genaim told me that Gaydamak was &quot;a great man&quot;. It was his money that stopped the team going bankrupt. Indeed, he even tried to sign an Arab player, Abbas Suan, but the Beitar faithful weren&apos;t ready and rioted.  Last season Gaydamak became increasingly exasperated by his fans&apos; behaviour, first for continually singing racist chants, then for whistling through a minute&apos;s silence to mark the assassination of Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, then when a group of Beitar&apos;s fans trashed the Israeli FA&apos;s offices in Tel Aviv and daubed death threats on its walls, and then, finally, for the two-point penalty that followed a pitch invasion in last season&apos;s title decider.  &quot;The idiot bastards can leave,&quot; Gaydamak said of the hardcore troublemakers at his club. &quot;The fans that went wild yesterday are bastards, and I have no respect for them. While their numbers are in the thousands, they are not the majority.&quot; He has even had his own &apos;Palin moment&apos;, stating his desire to appoint an Arab deputy mayor if he is elected, a move that would do more than any other candidate to engage East Jerusalem&apos;s reticent Palestinian population. Then there&apos;s the philanthropy. Gaydamak has sunk millions of shekels into schemes that have seen him outmanoeuvre established political foes. When the town of Sderot on the Israeli/Gaza border came under a barrage of rocket attacks in the spring of 2007, Olmert, who had by now fallen out with Arkadi, got the mood of the nation totally wrong, insisting that its residents should sit tight and weather the storm. Any evacuation, he reasoned, would be a propaganda gift for Hamas.  With graphic pictures showing the residents of Sderot cowering in their basements gripping the Israeli public, Gaydamak had other ideas and rode to the rescue, setting up a luxury tent city in Tel Aviv&apos;s Hayarkan Park and laying on buses to evacuate all those who feared for their lives. The camp was staffed with gourmet chefs, tents with Playstation 2s for the kids to play on, and a nightly cabaret. The staff liberally handed out black and gold Beitar scarves. Even earlier this month he paid $13,500 out of his own pocket for the medical treatment of a Palestinian man who had a heart attack during Friday prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque.  And then there&apos;s the madness. Gaydamak has always been known for his sharp tongue \u2013 he once described Olmert as &apos;stupid&apos; \u2013 but he outdid himself last month when he declared his opinion on whether the annual Jerusalem Gay Pride march, which has become a pivotal cause for the religious right in the city, would go ahead on his watch. &quot;They want to be proud? They&apos;re allowed to. They want to demonstrate? Fine,&quot; he stated at a press conference. &quot;But the streets of Jerusalem are a symbol, and parading on them would be an aggressive act against our tradition, against our values and against our morale. I would lie on the ground in order to block the march and would even die before I approve the pride parade in the city.&quot; Of course, this can all be explained by political expediency. The ownership of Beitar, or at least being a staunch fan, has been seen in the past as, if not a gateway into politics, then certainly a way of courting a sizeable chunk of Likud-leaning voters for everyone from Netanyahu to Olmert. Aligning the religious right on both sides of Jerusalem is also a clever way of finding common ground between two seemingly paradoxical constituencies: the sanctity of Jerusalem as a religious totem for Jews, Muslims and Christians, where issues like gay pride marches would have both Imams and Rabbis spluttering into their dainty cups of mint tea.  Already he has sought counsel from the Mufti of Jerusalem and the Vatican. The desire to give the outgoing prime minister Olmert, one of the most unpopular politicians in Israel&apos;s history, a bloody nose and appear to be a safe pair of hands in times of crisis is self-explanatory. Whether this is enough for Gaydamak to persuade a majority of Jerusalemites to vote for him is probably unlikely. Despite currently polling third, and some reports from Israel suggest he may even be looking for a way out rather than face the prospect of finishing last, his camp maintain that their man can spring a surprise by concentrating on his right-wing religious core. The problem is that as the elections near, more unflattering reports emerge. Suddenly the Israeli Abramovich&apos;s pockets don&apos;t seem so deep anymore.  &quot;When he did his business in Russia and Angola he didn&apos;t have to declare how he did it [made his fortune],&quot; Adar explained. &quot;But as soon as he bought Israeli companies he had to announce it at the stock exchange. It turns out he is a worse businessman than me! Arkadi is not doing well in the past year.&quot;  Even his formally loyal Beitar fans that used to fill the Teddy Stadium with choruses of &apos;Arkadi is the Messiah&apos; have started to desert him. This season has so far been a shambles. With two points docked for bad behaviour and the team knocked out of Champions League qualification after an embarrassing 5-0 capitulation to Wislaw Krakow, the side drew 0-0 with arch-rivals Bnei Sakhnin in the opening game of the season. Arkadi responded by sacking not only the manager, but also almost all of the non-playing staff, even the press spokesman.  But the turning point was the next game, another 0-0 draw with the equally despised Maccabi Tel Aviv. &quot;Beitar got a penalty in the 90th minute,&quot; recalled Adar. &quot;[Shimon] Gershon took it and missed and on TV you could see him [Arkadi] shouting in Russian &apos;Why Gershon, why?&apos; And after that he said [in a press conference] &apos;Why does the coach not get rid of Gershon?&apos; That is when the penny dropped [with Beitar fans] that he is not very good at being in charge of a football club.&quot; Still, the big prize is the mayoralty of Jerusalem, one of Israel&apos;s, if not the Middle East&apos;s, most important jobs. It&apos;s hard to think of a more divided city, split as it is religiously, culturally and politically. It&apos;s a tense place, made tenser by the spate of Palestinian ram raids which seem to have replaced the suicide bomb as the last-resort weapon of choice, where one wrong move can ignite latent hatreds. The mayor has powers over boundaries and building permits, both politically explosive issues for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem who feel they are being slowly &apos;built out&apos; of their neighbourhoods to skew the demographics in favour of the city&apos;s Jewish population. It takes a deft hand, one which many feel he just doesn&apos;t have. For evidence, look no further than the goings-on at Beitar this season.  &quot;In three years he has sacked six coaches, fired the entire top-level management team and replaced the third chairman in three years with the club&apos;s former goalkeeper Itzik Korenfein,&quot; explained Jeremy Last, sports editor at the Jerusalem Post. &quot;His charitable work could be seen as showing that he cares about the Israeli people but it is also an indication of his political attitude. A year ago he admitted in a television documentary on him that he hoped people would support him politically because of the charitable work he has done. The majority of Jerusalemites do not want a mayor who will go on a sacking spree the minute things go wrong. Besides the concerns about his management style, Gaydamak quite clearly has no political experience.&quot;  But the biggest barrier of all may be the fact that Gaydamak will quite literally not be truly able to understand his coveted constituency. &quot;He barely speaks any Hebrew, a fact which creates a barrier between himself and both his co-workers and his voters,&quot; Last continued. &quot;He insists the language barrier is not an issue, but it is hard to imagine how he will be able to sit in city council meetings when he won&apos;t be able to understand what is being said.&quot; November 11 will see whether his philanthropy and wrapping himself in the black and gold of Beitar will pay off. If it doesn&apos;t Arkadi will no doubt be looking for a new challenge in pastures new. I hear there&apos;s a decent, mid-sized Premier League team for sale on the south coast.

We also need to cast the villain of the piece: Omar Bakri Muhammad, the former &quot;Tottenham Ayatollah&quot; now resident in Lebanon and threatening to bombard our hero with a bevy of compliant suicide bombers. With his thick beard and glasses he looks a bit like Ricky Tomlinson (which would also introduce a sly Scouse connection). Finally we require a sidekick. Republican rocker Ted Nugent has today offered his services as a bodyguard, touting himself as &quot;Dirty Harry with a pigtail&quot; and promising to protect the star from &quot;voodoo religious nutjobs&quot;. Maybe we can have the pair of them sharing a hotel room, squabbling over the TV remote or brainstorming lyrics on the road from Bethlehem to Tel Aviv. As for that working title, feel free to chuck it out. Certainly there are plenty of other songs to sift through for alternatives. Lady Madonna or Let it Be might suffice thanks to their &quot;Mother Mary&quot; references. Or what about She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, to evoke the crazed ambush of a deranged extremist?

With only a few hours of practice, the former Beatle hoped to woo his fans with the holy language while performing in Israel&apos;s least sacred city, Tel Aviv. Translating between Hebrew and English is often tricky and in Israel in the 1960s the Beatles were called the Rhythm Beetles. But the 50,000 Israelis flocking to Hayarkon park were certain to overlook any clumsiness as his fans in this city of non-believers see his visit as a blessing. &quot;For all those years I was praying some miracle would happen and the Beatles would come,&quot; said Nathan Keren, 61. Keren was 17 and a devoted fan in 1964 when the Israeli government, still shocked at seeing thousands of hysterical teens writhing to the live rhythm of Cliff Richard, decided to ban the Beatles. &quot;Israel has changed a lot, it&apos;s become very open and democratic since the sixties,&quot; said Keren. John Lennon once declared the Beatles more popular than Jesus. In Israel that was always a safe bet, but even among those born after Lennon&apos;s death McCartney is treated as something of a Messiah and the band&apos;s music is still more popular than other contemporary stars.

Zeev Sternhell, a political scientist at Hebrew University, was wounded in the leg when the bomb exploded as he stepped out of his front door to close the garden gate in Jerusalem.  Police found posters in the area offering a reward of around \u00a3170,000 to anyone who kills a member of Peace Now, a well-known Israeli group which campaigns against the occupation.

Sternhell, a respected academic and Holocaust survivor who studied the history of fascism, has publicly criticised the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He was awarded the Israel Prize this year, although some settlers petitioned the supreme court to try to prevent him receiving the award. He had reportedly received threats in the past. If the attack is proven to come from a rightwing group it would mark a rare display of Jewish extremist violence within Israel. There are frequently violent clashes between hardline ideological settlers and soldiers on patrol in the West Bank: some of the most extreme settlers attack soldiers involved in any attempt to take down or remove settlement outposts. Those attacks have grown more common and more violent in recent months, apparently deterring the Israeli government from any serious effort to remove the settlements, all of which are illegal under international law.

As you probably know (but may not), it&apos;s a bit of American jargon to describe a covertly pre-arranged event designed by supporters of one or another candidate \u2013 or party \u2013 to impact on an imminent election and influence the result. For once today&apos;s story amounted to a thumbs down to the October surprise \u2013 a popular routine on the left, even I&apos;ve floated it occasionally \u2013 because some of this year&apos;s speculation has focused precisely on that option: that Israel would trigger such a crisis just ahead of the November 4 presidential elections to help John McCain win the presidency. That&apos;s not so daft when you think about it. The Israelis are rightly scared of Tehran&apos;s mullahs and their traffic engineer-turned-fundamentalist president getting hold of nuclear weapons, almost as scary as Pakistan having nukes (that&apos;s a joke by the way). They once bombed Iraq&apos;s O&apos;Chirac facilities and \u2013 so the polls tell us \u2013 are the ONLY country around the world which prefers McCain to Barack Obama. Come to think of it, I heard a version of this scenario when I was in Washington for a family wedding in July. A well-connected friend said it was doing the rounds: the Israelis had convinced themselves that President Obama would be bad for them. Actually a US president who yanked Israel&apos;s chain a bit \u2013 none has since Eisenhower \u2013 would probably do self-absorbed Tel Aviv more good than a Paul McCartney visit. But that&apos;s another story. Is there any historic substance to the &quot;October surprise&quot; fear? It started in the politically-polarised 60s when first Lyndon B Johnson \u2013 who stood down in 1968 over the Vietnam war \u2013 announced a halt to the controversial bombing of north Vietnam, to help his number two and would-be successor, Hubert Humphrey, beat Richard Nixon. It failed, but in 1972, when Watergate-paranoid Nixon faced a much weaker Democratic candidate, nice-but-hopeless George McGovern, he encouraged Henry Kissinger to talk up the &quot;peace in our time&quot; stuff. He won by 20 points \u2013 a near record margin \u2013 but went on to defeat himself. There have been other examples, though I don&apos;t think George W Bush&apos;s drink-driving arrest \u2013 revealed close to polling day in 2000 \u2013 quite counts in the big league. Nor do routine but clumsy attempts by al Qaida to issue an Osama bin Laden Christmas video a few weeks early. Wikipedia University cites North Korea&apos;s 2006 nuclear test and mentions the Lancet/Johns Hopkins study (2004) on the death toll in Iraq. Since co-author, Les Roberts, was standing for Congress on an anti-war ticket and said the timing was electoral he can hardly be accused of covert action, whatever outside experts said about his methodology. To my mind, the serious claim was made after the 1980 presidential elections in which Governor Ronald Reagan beat the sitting president, Jimmy Carter. It was said the Reagan team had done a secret deal with the Iranian regime of Ayatollah Khomeini to ensure that the US hostages \u2013 seized at the embassy a year earlier \u2013 would not be released before polling day, as Reagan feared they might. As I recall they were finally let go as Carter&apos;s plane took off on the final flight home to Georgia. At least three books said the claim was true and two Congressional inquiries concluded that it wasn&apos;t. That is a pretty inconclusive result. I&apos;m not a conspiracy theorist \u2013 cock-ups drive history. But big conspiracies sometimes do exist. For instance, Bismark really did edit the telegram which prompted the airheaded Napoleon III to declare war on Prussia in 1870. Later the German general staff, who really ran the Second Reich, really were looking for an excuse (it turned out to be the murder at Sarajevo) to go to war in 1914 because modernisation was finally taking place in Russia. By 1917 Russia might be impossible to beat: do it now. Cynical and horrible, but they made a series of bad calls which eventually ruined them when they gambled they could win the war (not least by sinking American shipping) before the Americans and their money \u2013 they had solid banks at the time \u2013 arrived on the Western Front. Serves them right, though they ruined us all in the process. You may be thinking that history repeated itself in Iraq in 2002-3 and tipped the American Empire towards terminal decline. I support the cock-up theory there \u2013 sheer incompetence \u2013 but let&apos;s not go there today. It will be US bankers who do it for the US. Why might 1980 have been the real thing? Only because of what we do know. The Reagan government did have back channels to the ayatollahs. The president did later sanction the sale of badly-needed weapons, including TOW missiles to Tehran. It did channel the proceeds to the contra rebels in Nicaragua in express defiance of Congressional resolutions. It did all come out in the end. But no, in case you&apos;re wondering, I don&apos;t think the Bush administration arranged for the Pentagon and the Twin Towers to be attacked on 9/11, though I often read that many people around the world do.

The ex-Beatles man told reporters he was &quot;not nervous, but excited&quot; ahead of his two-hour performance in Tel Aviv last night, during which the 66-year-old played Hello Goodbye, Eleanor Rigby and Back in the USSR before a crowd of 40,000. His choice of Let It Be to close the show was a poignant one given the circumstances surrounding his performance.  The Beatles were banned from performing in Israel in 1965 because the government was worried about the potentially corrupting effect &quot;Beatlemania&quot; might have on young fans. The current government lifted the ban earlier this year, presumably less worried now about the ability of the surviving members of the group to induce mass hysteria in the Israeli public.  Sir Paul McCartney&apos;s decision to play in Tel Aviv was not without controversy, with the singer telling an Israeli journalist: &quot;I was approached by different groups and political bodies who asked me not to come here. I refused. I do what I think, and I have many friends who support Israel.&quot; There were threats of violence also, from militant Islamic activist Omar Bakri Muhammad. &quot;If he values his life Mr McCartney must not come to Israel,&quot; said Bakri, who is banned from the UK. &quot;He will not be safe there. The sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him.&quot; However, the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel were quick to condemn Bakri&apos;s comments.  Speaking to reporters on the eve of his performance, McCartney said: &quot;The world knows about the conflicts that have been in that region and I like to think that if I go to a place it becomes evident that my message is a peaceful one and I hope that the idea will spread.&quot; He added: &quot;People ask this question through the years: &apos;Do you think music can change things?&apos; I think it can.

But, if it was John Lennon, I&apos;d pay $1,000 to see him!&quot;. Since I&apos;m a contemporary of McCartney I let the age issue pass. But I have to admit that when it was announced that McCartney was coming, I told friends that if it was Lennon, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate. But McCartney? I wasn&apos;t sure, but after long deliberation, decided to go. After all, in a way it was poetic justice. My uncle Dov Barnir was the youngest member of the 1st Knesset, a member of the Mapam/United Workers party, the leftwing party that had 19 seats, making it the second strongest faction in the Knesset after Ben-Gurion&apos;s Mapai. In 1965, he was appointed to a committee headed by then IDF chief education officer Mordechai (Morele) Bar-On, to decide whether to issue a permit for the Beatles to perform in Israel. They resolved that a visit by John, Paul, George and Ringo would &quot;corrupt Israeli youth&quot;, so a permit was denied the impresario who had been negotiating to bring them. Bar-On, who had been an aide to legendary general Moshe Dayan, went on to become a leading spokesperson for the Peace Now movement. He later apologised for his attitude towards the Beatles, and on a desert-island-discs-like radio programme he said that he would take a Beatles record. I don&apos;t know if my uncle ever apologised for his part in the decision, but I decided to make amends for him by going to the concert. Although I originally considered the Beatles a pale imitation of the real thing, they eventually became part of the soundtrack of my life, as of so many others of my generation. As for the concert itself, it could have been a reflection of a tension between &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; - which he sang with gusto together with the crowd with a big peace symbol filling the screen - the only time he mentioned John - and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, filled with images of fire, brimstone with dramatic fireworks rising above the stage. But it wasn&apos;t. This was Paul McCartney after all, and thus it was mainly love songs, his forte. He also shouted to the crowd that &quot;we&apos;re really gonna rock tonight in Tel Aviv&quot;, mainly via lively versions of Back in the USSR, Get Back, and a delightful pounding version of She was Just 17. The highlight for me was singing along with Paul Close Your Eyes, Follow the Sun, Hey Jude, and particularly a haunting version of Yesterday, one of the most beautiful songs ever written. And there was also Eleanor Rigby and A Day in the Life. John may have no longer have believed in Jesus, Elvis or the Beatles, but Paul clearly believes in both the Beatles and Wings. He is not exactly a raconteur, and his commentary was rather monosyllabic and inane, and despite being a living monument to the extraordinarily creative foursome, he never mentioned Ringo, and barely mentioned John and George. His fellow band members on stage also went unnamed. Clearly, the Beatles were a rare synergy of a number of creative talents coming together, with John providing the rebelliousness and idealism, George providing the musical curiosity and virtuosity and Ringo providing the funky joy of life. Paul provided the lyricism, with a touch of music hall. He could have said &quot;make love, not war&quot;, but all he said in Tel Aviv was &quot;make love, but not here&quot;, not now. To his credit, he did make a point of being inclusive - wishing the crowd both a Shana Tova (happy New Year) and a Ramadan Karim. As the concert drew to a close, in the presence of many of Israel&apos;s leading singers and performers who came to see how he put together a show, I wondered how he would close. For the second encore, he sang the moving rendition of Yesterday. What could possibly follow that? The answer was Sergeant Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band thanking everyone for having come to see the show, and saying &quot;In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot; And I have to admit that, last night, echoes of his performance continued into my dreams.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-26T13:00:11Z", "title": "Hillel Schenker: A warmish welcome for Paul McCartney in Tel Aviv", "sentences": ["He also shouted to the crowd that &quot;we&apos;re really gonna rock tonight in Tel Aviv&quot;, mainly via lively versions of Back in the USSR, Get Back, and a delightful pounding version of She was Just 17.", "He could have said &quot;make love, not war&quot;, but all he said in Tel Aviv was &quot;make love, but not here&quot;, not now."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/26/paulmccartney.popandrock"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "Night fell over the village, though it made no difference to us, lying slumped against the walls of the nagmash (armoured personnel carrier). Ten of us were crammed into a space not much bigger than a double bed, flung back and forth every time we hit a boulder in the road. We shared the space with the remains of our lunch, as well as tomorrow&apos;s breakfast. The sweat pouring down our faces was black with dirt, and our shirts were stuck fast to our backs. Gabe looked like a melting snowman - if it weren&apos;t for his moaning quietly from time to time, I&apos;d have thought he&apos;d passed out in the back.  Occasionally, I&apos;d muster the energy to stand up and peer through the small panes of bulletproof glass at the top of the nagmash to try to get my bearings. The windows were far too thick to see anything clearly, but we&apos;d already been through the centre of Tulkarm once and now seemed to be circling the deserted backstreets over and over.  Having been stuck in this cauldron for 15 hours, I couldn&apos;t have cared less whether or not we caught the terrorists - I was all for calling it a draw, and arranging a replay in two weeks&apos; time.  Not so our platoon commander. He stood up at the front of the vehicle, urging Shai to drive ever onwards towards God knew what. He manned the machine gun mounted on the roof, swivelling it in the direction of any unfortunate who was sharing the cobbled roads with our mini-tank. Eventually we noticed that we were slowing down, and it sounded as though we were now driving off-road, which was usually a sign that we were looking for a place to park up and rest.  Perking up momentarily, we debated whether this was a five-minute pit stop or the couple of hours&apos; sleep we&apos;d been promised. We piled out of the back door and surveyed our surroundings. We seemed to be in the back garden of a mansion-sized house on a residential backstreet, and the owner&apos;s family were peering at us from the porch with a mixture of bemusement and disgust.  We took positions - everyone covering one another, guns locked and loaded, as we edged forward. The squad from the other nagmash were also here, approaching from the other side of the garden, and we were now 20 strong as we descended on the house that we were going to commandeer for the night.  The platoon commander delivered curt instructions in Arabic to the family members sitting on chairs on the veranda. Taking Matan with him, he disappeared inside the house and set about locking the family in the basement, before letting the rest of us in to search the building. Once we&apos;d declared it clear, we all gathered in the lounge to receive our orders. We were to guard in pairs, everyone doing 20-minute shifts over the next four hours while the others slept. We stripped off our shirts, rolled them up as pillows, and crashed out on the tiled floor of the living room.  We were under strict orders not to touch anything in the house; not even to use the bathrooms. The place was a palace compared with some of the shacks we&apos;d been used to searching - it turned out the houses we took over were always big, to avoid embarrassing poorer folk who would be ashamed of their meagre possessions. It still felt as if we were taking liberties, half-naked and sprawled all over the floor of this family&apos;s lounge. I could hardly argue; we could not drive all the way back to our side of the border every time we needed to sleep. And if we dossed down in the nagmash here on the West Bank, we&apos;d be sitting targets for anyone with a rocket-propelled grenade who might fancy his chances. On the other hand, keeping the family locked in the basement smacked of human shields to me. I passed out and went to sleep anyway - the thought in my mind that there was no way we were winning the peace with this particular clan.  It all began in the comfort of my London home as I watched the second intifada unfold on the TV news. I felt the piercing stare of an Israeli Lord Kitchener: my country needed me. With every bus that exploded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the feeling grew stronger - I should be playing my part. I had a religious affiliation to Israel, the land of my forefathers, and a more personal attachment to the modern-day Jewish state thanks to twice-yearly childhood holidays and a gap year spent travelling the country.  So it was that in November 2004 I found myself in a barracks on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, struggling to pull on eight-holed combat boots and staring at my olive-clad reflection in the mirror. Within a matter of months, I would be on my first tour of duty in the heart of the West Bank.  Our first placement after completing training was guarding Rachel&apos;s Tomb, a site of pilgrimage for Jews, situated on the edge of the al-Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. At that time, the Bethlehem stretch of the security wall was unfinished, which meant extra troops were required to provide protection for the thousands of visitors who thronged daily to the site. We rode the bulletproof buses from the checkpoint to the tomb, as much to calm the nerves of the tourists as to provide any practical assistance. Rock-throwing youths dispersed long before we could dismount the buses and give chase, and the shatterproof glass in the windows was more than sufficient to repel the sporadic attacks.  However, we were required to carry out regular patrols of the Muslim cemetery behind the tomb, as well as the narrow alleys of the refugee camp, where our presence did nothing to abate the tension that was palpable on every street corner. Decked out in full combat gear, with words of encouragement from the pilgrims ringing in our ears as we left the tomb, we would march towards al-Aida and straight into a scene from CNN. A teeming refugee camp, piles of rubble everywhere, Arab men lounging on half-built walls and us: six heavily armed Israeli soldiers.  On one roasting hot summer&apos;s day, during a routine patrol, the inevitable happened - a group of youths, screaming &quot;Allahu Akhbar&quot;, greeted us with a hail of stones, and we took cover behind a nearby building. The sergeant said that he and Shtricks would hide behind a wall while the other four of us walked in a snake-like formation in view of the youths. The aim was to draw another barrage of rocks, at which point the sergeant would arrest one or two of them. It was too easy - we walked, they threw, we retreated, the sergeant leapt out and slammed a boy against the wall, holding him by the neck. He was a sullen, scruffily dressed boy of maybe 14. The sergeant asked us if he&apos;d been one of the stone throwers; I said yes, without being 100% sure - it hardly mattered, since the objective was to make a point to his friends.  We marched him to our base. There was a dodgy moment when a group of men, maybe 25-year-olds, ran towards us, shouting; we trained our guns on them and made them back off. We delivered the boy to one of the squadron commanders. It was our first unplanned arrest (as opposed to arrests made on a raid), so everyone swarmed around the kid as if he was a rare butterfly we&apos;d netted. He was made to sit in the sun against a wall and, cursing and shouting, he threw the cup of water he was offered all over the commander.  The sergeant was strutting around, beaming gleefully - a bit overly proud, I thought, considering he&apos;d nabbed a teenager, with five armed soldiers behind him as backup. After about 20 minutes, we marched the boy out to hand him over to his parents, who had been summoned to meet us. The father had to lift his shirt to prove he wasn&apos;t wearing a bomb belt before we allowed him anywhere near us. The boy went home and the patrol was over. The debriefing was interesting; we sat in the same positions in the sergeant&apos;s room as we had before. Only an hour had passed, but we were older and wiser - we dissected the experience as if it were simply another part of training, and not as though we&apos;d been in a very real, very dangerous situation that nearly became a riot.  Was this really the best way to keep the peace and ease tension, I asked the sergeant. He maintained that the boy would learn his lesson and it was all for the best; I said that was wishful thinking - the boy was plainly now a hero among his friends. Did he expect us to take pride in what we&apos;d done?  Once the debriefing was over, we discussed the incident among ourselves. Why did our merely being on patrol - not beating someone or damaging property - cause such a violent reaction? Why did young kids, who had been playing with kites and footballs until we arrived on patrol, suddenly become mini-terrorists? It was clear that several of us weren&apos;t comfortable with our seemingly over-the-top reaction to the stone-throwing. If the David and Goliath overtones of the situation were clear to us, how much more so would they be to those on the other side of the divide? As the weeks wore on, and we spent more and more time dealing with the locals through the sights of our guns, it became increasingly apparent that we were never going to win over hearts and minds - not when we were barking, &quot;Stop or I&apos;ll shoot&quot; at women approaching us on the checkpoint. Wasn&apos;t there a way to engage with Palestinians that wouldn&apos;t compromise our security?  Another patrol on Route 60 made it very clear that our commanders were interested only in the here and now. We were going through the usual stop and search of random pedestrians and vehicles when an incident just as we were leaving turned nasty. Six of us stopped a man and his son in their BMW; we ordered the father out at gunpoint while the five-year-old child silently watched. The platoon commander dealt with him very curtly, making him stand, sit and so on, at whim. This went on for about 25 minutes, with passersby watching, until the squadron vice commander rocked up in his Jeep and treated the detainee, a family man of about 35, even more brusquely. The suspect was becoming visibly upset. Once the commanders finally got bored with tormenting him, we headed back, stopping to force another man and his six-year-old son to lift their shirts on the way.  During the debriefing, it all came out as we took on the platoon commander for his fierce handling of the situation. Several soldiers were upset at an event earlier in the week, where they&apos;d been made to surround a house at 1am and wake all the residents, a large family, and order them out into the cold, simply for a practice exercise. All this led to some heated debate. I asked the platoon commander if he would have been happy if his own dad had been treated in the way he&apos;d dealt with the man in the BMW. As usual, he batted away all criticism with a flat statement that everything we did was &quot;for security reasons&quot;, plain and simple.  The discontent in my unit grew with every unsavoury incident that we witnessed or in which we were forced to take part. My friend Shai, who was assigned to accompany two prisoners en route to Shin Bet interrogators, told me that the interrogators ordered the soldiers to finish their meals and put the remains from the plates into a sandwich for the Palestinians. Shai refused - &quot;Are we Nazis?&quot; - and gave them half his meal. He also told me that when the Palestinians offered some of the food back to the soldiers, the Shin Bet men tossed it out the window, saying, &quot;Don&apos;t eat food after an Arab&apos;s touched it.&quot;  Our next posting was in the nearby village of Bet Jalla, where our base was a disused hotel on the edge of town. One morning, out on patrol, we got a call from the &quot;eye in the sky&quot; camera crew, who directed us to drive to a local school where students were apparently hurling rocks at Jewish cars. That was music to the ears of our Yemenite commander, Shoko, who morphed into A-Team mode all of a sudden, ramming a magazine into his gun and checking his grenades were in his vest. A bit strong, I thought, seeing as we were going to be at least 10 years older than our opponents.  We flew along the Bet Jalla backstreets, nearly upending a donkey and cart when we tore around one blind corner. We drove with the back doors of the Jeep open, and Arthur and I kept our guns trained on anyone who stared at us for too long. Arthur turned to me as we sped along: &quot;You know, I&apos;m much less scared of being around Palestinians than I used to be.&quot; No shit, mate - you&apos;re in a bulletproof Jeep with three other soldiers and enough firepower to turn the whole town into Swiss cheese.  As we approached the school, we parked hurriedly on the grass and split into pairs. Arthur stayed with the driver in the Jeep, so I was Shoko&apos;s zug (partner), which meant that wherever he went, I trailed in his wake, Marlboro-coated lungs protesting at the pace at which I was running. As we rounded the final corner, we were confronted with 15 10-year-olds holding rocks bigger than their heads, which they tossed off the side of the hill into the path of the cars below. Even more disturbing was the sight of their 50-year-old teacher standing to one side, supervising them as he puffed languidly on a cigarette. When Shoko shouted at him in Arabic, asking what the kids were doing, he shrugged and replied, &quot;It&apos;s their break time.&quot;  After Shoko warned him he would bring the children to order himself if necessary, the teacher ever so slowly turned towards his charges and told them to go inside. We piled back into the Jeep, depressed - the other three because there had been no action, me because we hadn&apos;t had time for a cigarette break. I turned on my iPod and ignored Shoko&apos;s debriefing. There were plenty of political and emotional issues to discuss after seeing a class of infants throwing missiles with their teacher looking on, but the present company wasn&apos;t the ideal forum. Dror, the (reservist) driver, was more concerned with phoning his broker to check on his trades than listening to the two-way radio. Shoko looked genuinely sad that he wouldn&apos;t be adding to his kill-count today, and Arthur&apos;s idea of philosophical discourse was dissecting Tupac&apos;s lyrics as though analysing Baudelaire.  The next day I was again on Shoko&apos;s squad, and once more the women monitoring the cameras put out a call for us to head to the school. I was starting to feel like an Ofsted inspector. The brief this time was that a boy wanted for a recent Molotov attack had been spotted in the playground, and we needed to bring him in for questioning. Our team played with the same formation as the day before: Shoko and me up front (to make the arrest), Arthur and the driver shoring up the defence (or, more accurately, gorging themselves on the remains of breakfast in the back of the Jeep).  This time I was much more aware of the danger. Every corner we rounded, we did so guns first, since we had no idea who was lying in wait or where we were going. It was eerily quiet as we went round the perimeter of the school; I could just about make out the dull tones of classroom chanting from an upstairs window, but otherwise the only sound was our guns smashing against our bulletproof vests as we ran. We finally found the playground where a football match was taking place. Twenty kids in their mid-teens were hurtling around the concrete pitch in hot pursuit of a worn-out leather ball.  As we edged up to the fence, one or two of the players noticed us, but barely looked twice. Finally, Shoko got word over the radio of which kid we wanted and, after shouting at the children in Arabic, he marched determinedly into their midst and grabbed his quarry. The other students literally turned their backs on the scene without a word, continuing their match, unperturbed that one team was now a player down. Was it really such an everyday occurrence for them that it didn&apos;t bother them in the slightest? I tried to imagine what would have happened if a couple of marines had arrested one of my classmates. Then again, I couldn&apos;t imagine our headmistress allowing us to throw rocks at passing cars either.  As Shoko manhandled the boy towards the Jeep, one of the boy&apos;s teachers struggled to catch up with us, shouting something indecipherable in Arabic. (Actually, everything in Arabic was indecipherable to me. All I could say was &quot;Stop or I&apos;ll shoot&quot;, &quot;Give me your ID&quot; and &quot;Lift up your shirt&quot; - the sum total of the army&apos;s language training.) She pleaded with Shoko, who didn&apos;t like being interrupted in the middle of his &quot;mission&quot;. Eventually the camera crew told us to let the boy go since he was too young to hold overnight and it would have been more trouble than it was worth to have to return him to the village at sundown.  As we walked back to the jeep, Shoko turned to me and said, &quot;Did you see that? I swear, the little fucker was about to start crying.&quot; &quot;Yeah, Shoko - he&apos;s barely 13 and staring down the barrels of two semi-automatics,&quot; I said, surprised at the look on my commander&apos;s face. Perhaps, growing up a dark-skinned Yemenite surrounded by Ashkenazis (European Jews), he&apos;d had rough times - now he was getting his moment in the sun. It was raiding the house near Tulkarm that was the last straw for me; looking into the eyes of the children as we screamed at their father and wrested from him command of his own house. That was when it dawned on me what the effect of our actions would be - the next generation were guaranteed to end up hating us when all they saw was us herding them like cattle.  There was another episode, too, a few days later, when our unit was called upon to bolster the forces massed in Homesh, a West Bank settlement scheduled for evacuation during the disengagement. Despite the threats of the settlers that they would fight tooth and nail to defend their homes, our commanders decided that we would ignore their words, down tools, and deal with them without our weapons to protect us. This was, they said, to douse the tension between the two camps; it was a far cry from the way we dealt with Palestinians who made similar threats. I tackled the platoon commander: if this softly-softly approach was the best for one group of &quot;enemies&quot;, why would it not be similarly effective in calming hostilities with the local Palestinians?  The Palestinians, he said, were a different kettle of fish entirely, for whom kid-glove treatment would be out of the question. In the event, the settlers attacked and wounded dozens of soldiers, but the incidents were brushed under the carpet by the authorities, who were keen to paint them as &quot;peaceful protesters&quot;, in contrast with their ever-violent, ever-aggressive Palestinian counterparts.  The more I banged my anti-occupation drum, the more I was confronted with the accusation that &quot;you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about - you haven&apos;t been in the country long enough to realise how much they hate us&quot;. But I believed 15 months in a combat unit more than qualified me to counter that claim. In order to be taken seriously in this country, you have to jump through hoops to prove you know what you are talking about, and also show that you are prepared to do your bit for the society in which you live. But doing your bit for society didn&apos;t have to mean donning combat boots and marauding the West Bank, making Palestinians&apos; lives a misery - this was a view shared by ever-increasing numbers of ex-combat soldiers in Israel. A study by Haifa University concluded that &quot;over the course of their military service, combat soldiers become less rightwing, adopt more dove-ish political views and are more open to compromise on security matters&quot;.  It was easy for the armchair warriors to urge Israel on to ever more combative lengths.

A study by the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy was set up by the Ministry of Justice to look into non-resident parents being awarded little or no contact with their children for the flimsiest of reasons. Last week, the study concluded that the vast majority of separated fathers enjoy access to their children. Only one in 10 cases ends up in court, the rest having been agreed between the parents. When the cases do go to court, more than three-quarters of the applicants, mainly fathers, are able to resolve contact issues, with only a small percentage denied contact altogether, in the interests of the children involved.  Not bad, in fact, pretty reasonable. Why then have these findings not been met with cries of joy from disgruntled campaigning fathers? There&apos;s just been some low-key muttering about how that&apos;s all very well, but what about the &apos;presumption of shared care&apos;? Could it be, as I have long suspected, that, for many members of fathers&apos; groups, it&apos;s always been less about justice-seeking than it has been about attention-seeking? While these fathers&apos; groups may have been set up with the best of intentions, they evolved all too quickly into social clubs for miserable sods who wanted a free pass to whine about women. Indeed, these past years, isn&apos;t it arguable that these campaigning dads have done more than any spiteful female to denigrate and undermine the concept of fatherhood, not to mention make a farce of it? Consider for one moment the frightening thought patterns that lead a grown man to think dressing up as Spiderman is his best shot at being taken seriously. Does a man like this have the Spidey sense he was born with? More seriously, going by my experience with family courts, have dads ever really had it that bad?  I wasn&apos;t remotely interested in barring contact between my daughter and her father. However, I couldn&apos;t help noticing that had I wanted this, to get anywhere, I would probably have had to produce camcorder footage of him tying her to a railway line while wickedly twiddling a luxuriant moustache. This is the truth of family courts - they are proactive almost to a fault about finding a way for the non-resident parent, male or female, to maintain contact with their children. They are fixated by this issue to the virtual exclusion of all others, which is the way it should be - whether the mother likes it or not.  However, contrary to the impression groups such as F4J give, mothers generally do like their children to have a father - you don&apos;t often see women on Jeremy Kyle shows wanting a paternity test to proves someone isn&apos;t the father. And women want fathers around not only for the priceless input of positive male influence, but also for the Holy Grail that all mothers, single or otherwise, seek - safe and reliable childcare. And there lies the bottom line. However badly the relationship ended, if he&apos;s a half-decent, committed dad, it&apos;s a rare and stupid woman who&apos;ll let go of him, not only for the child&apos;s sake, but her own - think of all the free babysitting.  In this way, it becomes clear that the real reasons a woman might not want the biological father around are just that - real reasons - ultimately to do with genuine fears about him hurting or upsetting the children or disrupting their lives in some way. In the special case of a &apos;campaigning dad&apos;, add maybe his inability to see past himself, his own pain, his own axes to grind, while doing his best to make his rage and ego seem like a noble quest.  It says something that one hears stories about how some of these campaigning dads fail to show up to see their children because they&apos;re far too busy ... campaigning to see them! It makes you wonder who&apos;s in those costumes - are they genuinely wounded and devoted dads or drama queens who find the cause far more exciting than actual fathering could ever be? It&apos;s time for disgruntled, estranged dads to realise that women simply cannot stop men being fathers. Only men can stop men being fathers. Indeed, all things considered, maybe the MOJ study might be a good opportunity to disband these groups for good. Let&apos;s face it, no one ever said that families didn&apos;t need fathers - there was just the suggestion that, once in a while, they could think about climbing out of their Batman suits and doing some actual fathering. Now he&apos;s laughing all the way to the bank, Banksy&apos;s a bore Banksy, the graffiti guerrilla artist, has formed a &apos;pest fund&apos; to identify the hundreds of works attributed to him that aren&apos;t actually his. He is also urging people not to take any of these works, or to buy them, unless they have been created for sale and officially authenticated. Wow - how renegade, how &apos;out there&apos;. It&apos;s like van Gogh hacking his ear off all over again. Except it isn&apos;t. Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but I thought this type of art was all about madness and impetuosity, as well as challenging the very definition of what art is or could be. So surely the fake Banksys fit right in. If guerrilla artists can run amok, why not fake guerrilla artists or even guerrilla art lovers?  Yet here we see Banksy whingeing about wanting everything officially authenticated and fastidiously pointing out which spray-canned doodles are his. &apos;Nah, that rat shitting in a Starbucks cup ain&apos;t mine. Nor that one of Ann Widdecombe lap dancing neither.&apos; Amazing isn&apos;t it how once someone&apos;s work starts selling for big bucks how corporate and humourless they become? Mind you, some of us always had doubts. There&apos;s been lots of speculation about who Banksy is - a man, a woman, a gang? - but there&apos;s no doubt what he&apos;s become - just another art book talking point on the coffee table, the 21st-century equivalent of those &apos;amusing&apos; clacking balls businessmen used to have on their desks. But maybe this is sour grapes. There is what I thought to be a Banksy at the top of my street. It&apos;s a Che Guevara sketch which, feeling a bit broke, I had half a mind to chisel off and hotfoot it to Sotheby&apos;s with. As Che is not doing anything peculiar, such as changing a baby&apos;s nappy or French kissing Stalin, I had this romantic idea that Banksy might have suffered sprayus interruptus and had to run off before he&apos;d finished. Now I realise that it&apos;s just a fake, it seems more authentically Banksy than ever. Paul McCartney ... is he arrogant or serially henpecked? It&apos;s difficult for vegetarians such as myself to criticise Paul McCartney. We view him as a kind of living god, soya-based version. But what on earth was he up to with that gig in Tel Aviv? Criticised for not also playing Palestine, and for costing more to protect than President Bush, McCartney could only blather pompously about &apos;helping the peace process in my own small way [blahhh] talking to Palestinians and Israelis, [drone] finding out for myself what the situation is&apos;. Oh the agonising stupidity and arrogance of the man! What next - an appearance in bin Laden&apos;s next cave video. &apos;Come on, Osama, pull up a tasselled cushion and let al-Qaeda give peace a chance!&apos; At first, I thought, this isn&apos;t McCartney&apos;s fault. Such is the Fab Four&apos;s influence that, just like the Queen smells fresh paint everywhere she goes, all Macca hears is Beatles worship: &apos;We love you Paul, your music heals us&apos; and all that suck-up. Hence the possibility that McCartney genuinely believes that the Israel-Palestine conflict can be helped with a quick burst of &apos;Yesterday&apos; and a cheeky thumbs-up. Then a dark thought occurred. Was Tel Aviv just more evidence that McCartney is the most pussy-whipped music icon ever? A former Beatle who lets his birds boss him around and tell him what to do. Think about it. It was lovely Linda who turned Paul on to vegetarianism. Then there was all that rolling about with seals with Heather. Now he has a Jewish girlfriend, the glamorous Nancy Shevell, he&apos;s suddenly playing concerts in Israel and &apos;finding out for myself what the situation is&apos;. Suspicious? I think so.

Israeli officials said the equipment was flown in last week along with 120 American staff and has been set up at an air force base in the southern Negev desert. It is believed to be the first time American personnel have been stationed in Israel since the 1991 Gulf war, when Patriot anti-missile batteries were deployed - to little effect - against Iraq&apos;s Scud missiles. In spite of the close strategic relationship between the two countries, Israel has traditionally preferred to staff its own defences and not depend on foreigners.  Ephraim Kam, an analyst at Tel Aviv University&apos;s institute for national security studies, called the radar system an &quot;important addition&quot; to Israel&apos;s defences and told AP he believed the US was sending a message that &quot;they are against any attack by Israel on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities at this time but cannot leave us without protection&quot;. Last week the Guardian quoted senior European diplomatic sources as saying that George Bush told Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, in mid-May that he opposed an Israeli attack on Iran, and said his opinion was unlikely to change for the duration of his presidency. The agreement to supply the new system to Israel was reportedly finalised in July. Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper suggested the deployment could be seen in two ways: as a means of preventing Israel from taking independent action against Iran; and to strengthen Israel&apos;s defence against missiles if Israel and/or the US attacked Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities. One key feature of the system is that information from early-warning satellites - which greatly increases the radar&apos;s ability to pinpoint launches - would remain in US hands. The satellite ground station would be in Europe and transmit data to Israel.  That dependency, reportedly of concern to Israeli officials, may boost Washington&apos;s power to veto unilateral Israeli action. The area of deployment on the Nevatim base is reportedly off-limits to non-US personnel. Commenting on the development, a Pentagon source said: &quot;We want to put Iran on notice that we&apos;re bolstering our capabilities throughout the region, and especially in Israel. But just as important, we&apos;re telling the Israelis, &apos;Calm down. Behave. We&apos;re doing all we can to stand by you and strengthen defences&apos;.&quot; The high-powered X-Band system, manufactured by Raytheon Company, would allow Israel&apos;s Arrow II ballistic shield to engage an Iranian Shehab-3 missile about halfway through its 11-minute flight to Israel, six times sooner than Israel&apos;s existing Green Pine radar can.  The X-Band can track an object the size of a baseball from 2,900 miles away. Iran makes no secret of its long-range ballistic missiles or its uranium enrichment programme though it routinely denies any plans to develop nuclear weapons. Israel has its own undeclared nuclear arsenal as well as aircraft, missiles and even submarines that could hit Iranian targets. News of the deployment was broken by Defense News, a US magazine, and confirmed by Israeli officials. US and German sources said 12 American aircraft delivered the system and personnel last Sunday. In parallel, Israel and the US are said to be concerned about the planned delivery of S-300 Russian anti-aircraft missiles to Iran, which would improve Tehran&apos;s defences against any strike against its nuclear installations. The X-Band, also-called &quot;phased-array&quot; system, has been deployed for the past two years in Japan against possible missile attacks from North Korea. There are plans to install one in the Czech Republic. News of the radar&apos;s arrival broke hours after the UN security council unanimously passed a resolution again ordering Iran to halt nuclear enrichment work but imposing none of the new sanctions Washington and its allies wanted. The resolution, dismissed by Iran as &quot;unconstructive&quot;, called on Tehran to &quot;comply fully&quot; with previous resolutions but also affirmed the UN&apos;s commitment to a negotiated solution.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-28T23:01:00Z", "title": "Israel supplied with long-range radar, but US to get missile warning first", "sentences": ["Ephraim Kam, an analyst at Tel Aviv University&apos;s institute for national security studies, called the radar system an &quot;important addition&quot; to Israel&apos;s defences and told AP he believed the US was sending a message that &quot;they are against any attack by Israel on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities at this time but cannot leave us without protection&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/israelandthepalestinians.iran"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Lebanon", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "For Israel, the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon war was all about questions. What mistakes were made, and who made them? What could be done to restore the Israeli military&apos;s &quot;deterrence&quot; after a widely perceived defeat? In general, what lessons could be learned from the confrontation with Hizbullah in order that next time, there would be no question of failure? Unfortunately, it seems that entirely the wrong kinds of conclusions are being reached, at least in the military hierarchy and among the policy shaping thinktanks. On Friday, Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper published comments made by Israeli general Gadi Eisenkot, head of the army&apos;s northern command. Eisenkot took the opportunity to share the principles shaping plans for a future war. The general promised &quot;disproportionate&quot; force to destroy entire villages identified as sources of Hizbullah rocket fire, the reasoning being that they are &quot;not civilian villages&quot; but rather &quot;military bases&quot; \u2013 the kind of reasoning that can land you in a war crimes tribunal. Eisenkot pointed to how Israel levelled the Dahiya neighbourhood of Beirut in 2006 and confirmed that this would be the fate of &quot;every village from which Israel is fired on&quot;. In case there was any doubt, he added: &quot;This is not a recommendation. This is a plan. And it has been approved.&quot; The frank promise of &quot;disproportionate&quot; force will be chilling for the Lebanese, who even last time round were subjected to indiscriminate attack, the targeted destruction of civilian infrastructure, and carpet cluster-bombing. But what Ha&apos;aretz dubbed the &quot;Dahiya Doctrine&quot; received enthusiastic support in some quarters, such as veteran Israeli TV and print journalist Yaron London. London seemed highly pleased with Eisenkot&apos;s determination to &quot;destroy Lebanon&quot;, undeterred &quot;by the protests of the &apos;world&apos;&quot;. London, while looking forward to Israel &quot;pulverising&quot; some &quot;160 Shi&apos;ite villages&quot; made the implications of Eisenkot&apos;s thinking clear: &quot;In practical terms, the Palestinians in Gaza are all Khaled Mashaal, the Lebanese are all Nasrallah, and the Iranians are all Ahmadinejad.&quot; The meaning of &quot;practical terms&quot; did not need repeating. The Ha&apos;aretz report also described how similar conclusions were being reached in reports by military-academic institutions. One such paper, published by the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, and unambiguously titled &quot;Disproportionate Force&quot;, details the author&apos;s (reserve Colonel Gabriel Siboni) understanding of the lessons of 2006:  With an outbreak of hostilities, the IDF will need to act immediately, decisively, and with force that is disproportionate to the enemy&apos;s actions and the threat it poses. Such a response aims at inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes.   Siboni urges the Israeli military to strike disproportionately at &quot;the enemy&apos;s weak points&quot;, and only afterwards to go after the missile launchers themselves. Devastating &quot;economic interests&quot;, &quot;centres of civilian powers&quot;, and &quot;state infrastructure&quot; will &quot;create a lasting memory among Syrian and Lebanese decision makers&quot; and thus increase &quot;Israeli deterrence&quot; and tie up &quot;enemy&quot; resources in reconstruction. A further new INSS publication by a former head of the National Security Council, urges Israel to guarantee that next time around, the Lebanese army and civilian infrastructure &quot;will be destroyed&quot;. Or as the author pithily puts it, &quot;People won&apos;t be going to the beach in Beirut while Haifa residents are in shelters&quot;. This determination to &quot;create a lasting memory&quot; in the minds of the Syrian and Lebanese is reminiscent of previous Israeli declarations of intent. In 2003, the IDF&apos;s chief of staff, Lieutenant General Moshe Ya&apos;alon, said that the war being waged in the occupied territories would &quot;sear deep into the consciousness of Palestinians that they are a defeated people&quot;. In 2006 in fact, the likes of Dr Reuven Erlich, head of the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre at the Centre for Special Studies in Tel Aviv, also recommended &quot;searing&quot; into the &quot;Lebanese consciousness&quot; the &quot;steep price they will pay for provoking and harassing us&quot;. Using brute force to &quot;sear&quot; certain truths into the consciousness of Arabs of varying descriptions has a certain heritage in Israeli and Zionist thought, going all the way back to Jabotinsky&apos;s theory of the &quot;iron wall&quot;. In the 1920s he wrote candidly that &quot;every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement&quot;. The need then was for an &quot;iron wall&quot; of force to bring the Palestinians to the point of giving up &quot;all hope&quot;. While the brutal logic of settler-colonial domination has been a guiding principle for Israeli military strategists through the decades, it has been complemented by the racist &quot;anthropological&quot; cliche that the &quot;Arabs only understand force&quot;. Interestingly, such tropes are now commonplace in US military discourse, as the Pentagon is also now in the position of directly occupying a Middle East country and facing resistance. Thus it seems Israel is learning entirely the wrong lessons from the 2006 conflict. Wrong, of course, from a moral point of view (though that only seems to enter the picture in terms of an anticipated international backlash). The conclusion could also be seen as flawed from the perspective of the kind of response it could invite. Fundamentally though, these pledges of disproportionate devastation show that the Israeli military leadership suffers from tunnel-vision policymaking, wedded to the idea that Israel will gain acceptance in the Middle East through force of arms.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-07T12:30:01Z", "title": "Ben White: Israel seems wedded to brute force in the Middle East", "sentences": ["One such paper, published by the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, and unambiguously titled &quot;Disproportionate Force&quot;, details the author&apos;s (reserve Colonel Gabriel Siboni) understanding of the lessons of 2006:  With an outbreak of hostilities, the IDF will need to act immediately, decisively, and with force that is disproportionate to the enemy&apos;s actions and the threat it poses.", "In 2006 in fact, the likes of Dr Reuven Erlich, head of the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre at the Centre for Special Studies in Tel Aviv, also recommended &quot;searing&quot; into the &quot;Lebanese consciousness&quot; the &quot;steep price they will pay for provoking and harassing us&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon"}, {"tags": ["Market turmoil", "Credit crunch", "Global recession", "Business", "World news", "UK news", "Money"], "article": "Stockmarkets around the world slumped today as fears of a global recession deepened.

SingaporeNews that Singapore slid into recession for the first time since 2002 drove the Straits Times index lower by 162 points, or 7.7%, to 1940. The economy shrank 6.3% during the third quarter. Singapore&apos;s central bank responded by easing monetary policy for the first time in five years. TaiwanMarkets were closed for a national holiday. IndonesiaShare trading was suspended for a third day. India India&apos;s central bank slashed its cash reserve requirement to free up some $12bn in funds and ease a squeeze that drove overnight rates in money markets to a 19-month high and forced the government to cancel a bond auction. The rupee hit an all-time low and the main stock index plunged more than 9%. India&apos;s finance minister said on TV that there was no need to worry about Indian bank deposits and investors should not panic. He said liquidity in the banking sector would improve once parliament gave the nod to providing more. Middle East IsraelThe Tel Aviv stock exchange was shut for the Yom Kippur holiday. IraqThe Baghdad stockmarket is booming, with the general index up by nearly 40% last month. Hotels and banks are among the hottest picks among the exchange&apos;s 95 listed companies, as violence has fallen to a four-year low. Saad Jalil, an investor, told Reuters: &quot;The world banking crisis won&apos;t affect us, our market is sealed off from the outside. We don&apos;t even have electronic trading.&quot;  Africa EgyptThe Egyptian stockmarket fell 4.6% to 1993 points, after plunging 16.4% to a two-year low on Tuesday. ZimbabweWhile much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging stock markets, bank collapses and a looming recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231 million percent.  Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts because of a drastic shortage of cash notes, with the Zimbabwe dollar in freefall. This week the government legalised the use of US dollars and rand in shops, formalising a part of the extensive foreign currency black market driven by the 3 million Zimbabweans who have left the country in search of work, mostly in South Africa. Everyone else is reduced to scraping by on near worthless salaries, bartering their furniture for food or growing their own to survive.  Europe Central EuropeRussia, Romania and Ukraine suspended their stockmarkets today. The cost of insuring the sovereign debt of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other eastern European countries soared, pricing in a mounting risk of default. Emerging sovereign debt spreads widened over US treasuries to their widest levels since mid-2004. RussiaThe Kremlin admitted it was considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia&apos;s dire banking problems. The Russian government will set up a special fund to buy &quot;quality&quot; assets from banks struggling with liquidity. Initially, Russia&apos;s central bank would pump in $15bn. Russia&apos;s twin leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of &quot;economic egoism&quot;. Vladimir Putin, Russia&apos;s prime minister, went further. During a meeting with Russian communists, he said the US&apos;s dominant role in economic matters was over. &quot;Confidence in the United States as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined \u2013 for good \u2013 I think,&quot; Putin gleefully observed. At the same time, Russia has been keen to understate its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again today on Russia&apos;s two main stockmarkets, TV news channels have been told not to use the words &quot;collapse&quot; or &quot;crisis&quot;. Apparently there isn&apos;t one. There has been little mention on TV of the flight of foreign investors from Russia, or the fact that many Russian oligarchs are struggling to pay their dry cleaning bills. Czech RepublicStocks in Prague fell more than 13%. HungaryShares in Budapest lost more than 12% and the Hungarian forint hit a two-year low. PolandThe Polish deputy finance minister, Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, said the fundamentals of Poland&apos;s economy were strong, and blamed the overnight decline of the Polish zloty on the slump in Hungary. The zloty hit an eight-month low. IcelandThere was no international trade of the Icelandic crown today after its banking sector, currency and economy crashed. Iceland says it has approached Russia for a loan to cover its banking liabilities, with analysts also speculating over a possible bail-out from the International Monetary Fund. AustriaShare trading was briefly halted in Vienna this morning. FranceThe CAC-40 index in Paris dropped 7.7% to 3176.  GermanyThe Dax closed 7.1% down at 4541 points. SwedenSweden&apos;s stock exchange declared a &quot;fast market&quot; until further notice for cash trading and for the Nordic derivatives market. The bourse said a fast market is declared when a financial market is experiencing high volume and increased volatility. The move allows greater flexibility in some trading rules. Shares in Stockholm fell nearly 6% to 196 points this morning. ItalyNearly half of Milan stocks were suspended after excessive losses. Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said the stockmarkets were in a grip of panic and fear, and expected consumption to fall due to fear. He said the government and the Bank of Italy had asked banks not to call in loans and to keep supporting industry. He also said European Union leaders may discuss the &quot;hypothesis&quot; of suspending markets temporarily while trying to resolve the global financial crisis. SpainThe Madrid stock exchange lost 8.7% to 973 points at the close. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is pushing for an urgent meeting of the 15 eurozone leaders. He asked French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, to call the meeting &quot;to define a strong, coordinated action among all the countries in the eurozone.&quot; SwitzerlandThe Swiss market dropped 4.75% to 5523 points. UKA wave of panic selling wiped more than \u00a3100bn off the value of Britain&apos;s biggest companies.  Dealers in the City dumped shares when trading began, sending the FTSE 100 plummeting by more than 10% in early trading. It closed 8.85% lower at 3932.1 \u2013 a 381.7 point fall, wiping about \u00a389.5bn off the value of Britain&apos;s biggest companies. This is the worst daily fall since the crash of 1987, beating Monday&apos;s 7.85% decline. Banks and miners led the fallers, along with blue chip firms such as British Airways and BT, as the wider economy was pulled into the deepening financial crisis. America/South America United StatesOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 700 points in the first ten minutes of trading to 7882, a fall of 8%. BrazilBrazil&apos;s main stock index plummeted more than 10% in early trading. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes because of a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; rule that kicks in when the Ibovespa loses 10%. Global financial turmoil has wiped out two years of stock market gains in Latin America&apos;s biggest economy. Brazil&apos;s currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the US dollar. VenezuelaPresident Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year&apos;s budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel.  The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, made an unfamiliar call for austerity in government departments. &quot;Spending on certain types of vehicles, mobile phones and parties will be eliminated,&quot; he said.  Chavez said Venezuela&apos;s state-heavy economy was better positioned to weather the financial storm, a &quot;sinking of neoliberalism&quot; which he blamed on the International Monetary Fund. He hoped the crisis would prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan to create a &quot;Bank of the South&quot; to counter the Washington-dominated World Bank. CubaCuba&apos;s isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. &quot;It was expected,&quot; the former president, Fidel Castro, noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma.  Other pro-government commentators blamed the crisis on the US and said &quot;associates or tributaries of that empire&quot; were now suffering the consequences. They said the time had come for Latin America to form the pan-regional leftist front which Cuba and Venezuela have espoused. Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated agriculture and infrastructure. President Raul Castro has warned of food shortages and months, if not years, of painful rebuilding. This week, the government started to lease land to private farmers, a cautious but potentially important initiative to loosen communist control and reform the island&apos;s moribund agriculture.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T16:15:00Z", "title": "Markets crash: How panic spread around the globe", "sentences": ["Middle East IsraelThe Tel Aviv stock exchange was shut for the Yom Kippur holiday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch1"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Channel 4", "Television", "Culture", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Television & radio"], "article": "This story begins with an ending. On 11 April 2003, Thomas Hurndall, a 21-year-old photojournalist, was shot in the head in Gaza by a sniper from the Israeli army.  Tom was a brilliant, intrepid young man, driven by an energetic morality, a wish to make a difference in the world. The shooting left him with unsurvivable brain damage, but he clung to life - against the odds - in a coma, for nine months.  While he lay dying in Tel Aviv and later in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, his parents, Anthony and Jocelyn Hurndall, took on a heroic struggle against the Israeli army. They were determined to seek truth and accountability at all costs. They had no idea how hard this was going to be. The Israeli army appeared to view Tom&apos;s death with indifference; there were no plans to investigate the shooting, interview witnesses or go to Gaza. Nor, at first, were they willing to meet the Hurndalls. Their claim was that their soldier had fired at an armed terrorist. Tom, dressed in an orange jacket (a known sign for peace workers), was unarmed. What&apos;s more he was shot while rescuing Palestinian children.  Faced with lies and silence, Anthony, a commercial lawyer, did the only thing he could: he took the case on himself. It was his meticulous investigation that led to the prosecution of Bedouin sniper Sergeant Wahid Taysir, who got eight years (the longest sentence ever received by an Israeli Defence Forces soldier for shooting an unarmed civilian in the occupied territories). Vengeance was not Anthony&apos;s motivation. He wanted only to find out what had happened. But the verdict was, in the bleakest way imaginable, a personal victory. Jocelyn has told her story in a beautifully written, uncompromising book, My Son Tom (Bloomsbury). More riskily, Channel 4 has turned the story into a drama to be broadcast tomorrow: The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall, written by Simon Block and directed by Rowan Joffe. Stephen Dillane plays Anthony and Kerry Fox plays Jocelyn. The film manages to be neither sensational nor sentimental - quite a feat.  It is its understatement that overwhelms. Anthony and Jocelyn divorced several years before Tom&apos;s death and the film conveys the strained decency of their relationship and their admirable transcending of differences.  The three surviving children - Sophie, Bill and Fred - are carefully characterised, and what the film spells out is that the shooting of Tom was a shattering of the entire family. Each of them took the impact of the sniper&apos;s fire. But I wondered if the film might have taken some emotional liberties too: Anthony is seen to be all head, Jocelyn all heart. And they are presented in rivalrous stances, as if we are being asked to choose between them. Was it really like that?  I met the Hurndalls separately: Anthony first, on a cold autumn day, in his offices near the Bank of England. He is tall, with a shambling gait, and is absolutely direct. You don&apos;t feel any slipperiness, any side. I liked him at once and admired his ability to talk with clarity about complicated issues. At the same time, he often left sentences unfinished as if he lacked the will to complete them. I noticed how often he leant back and shut his eyes when speaking, as if closing his eyes would have the opposite effect - make it possible to see. For Anthony, the film is a &apos;further memorial&apos; to Tom. But what matters most to him is that audiences should understand that what happened was &apos;not a freak accident, but a product of a policy that the Israeli armed forces were adopting in Gaza&apos;. There is barely suppressed outrage in his voice as he remembers the British government&apos;s failure to protest when Tom was shot: &apos;The government viewed Israel as a close ally who they did not want to put out in any way.&apos; It was only when a Tel Aviv bar was bombed by two British Muslims three weeks after the shooting of Tom in 2003 that Anthony became aware of how skewed the British government&apos;s attitude could be. &apos;Jack Straw expressed deep sympathy to the Israelis and promised to put all the resources of the British government at their disposal. This was our government taking responsibility for two people who were not employees of the British government, merely two citizens of Britain who happened to be in Israel.&apos; But when their own British citizens (Tom, along with Iain Hook, a UN worker shot by an Israeli sniper in November 2002, and James Miller, a documentary-maker shot by an IDF patrol in May 2003) were attacked by Israeli soldiers, there was no outcry (no ministerial interest at all, beyond a standard request, from a junior level, for a proper inquiry). &apos;They were shot not by people for whom the Israeli government had no responsibility but by their own soldiers. That, for me, was outrageous.&apos; Anthony approves of the film and thinks Dillane got a lot of things right. But he resists the idea of himself as the &apos;dry lawyer&apos;. He feels a &apos;little put out&apos; at a scene in which he is in a hurry to get back to the office while Jocelyn waits devotedly by Tom&apos;s bedside: &apos;It was not like that.&apos; He finds Dillane&apos;s Anthony &apos;more confident than I am. I am much more uncertain about things.&apos; He admits he can switch gear into &apos;detached&apos; mode and adds: &apos;I do live in my head.&apos; But he wants it on record that &apos;there is a lot of emotion there&apos;.  I don&apos;t doubt it. The way he uses Tom&apos;s name as emotional shorthand reveals the strength of his feelings: &apos;When I heard that Tom had been shot, I felt angry and worried, but already I knew that if this had happened, this was Tom doing something which was Tom. When we heard he had been going to rescue children - that was absolutely Tom. He had this strong, protective urge - a tremendous feeling of caring about putting things right.&apos;  It was Tom&apos;s need to put things right that became, for Anthony, an unspoken direction, an imperative. He remembers it like this: &apos;Tom, you are lying there. This is what you want. This is what we are going to do for you, Tom - with you.&apos; That &apos;with&apos; is affecting because the more accurate word would have been &apos;without&apos;. Anthony describes Tom as a little boy who was &apos;troubled&apos;, although &apos;outgoing&apos;, and &apos;determined to do his own thing&apos;. He &apos;hated arrogance&apos;, intellectual or otherwise. He was much loved because he was &apos;always there for people. He would talk to anybody, on any level, about anything.&apos;  Tom was 15 or 16 when his parents split up. &apos;Being the angry teenager he was, we didn&apos;t talk for a while,&apos; Anthony recalls. But football (Arsenal) and photography were shared passions. And by the time Tom left England in 2003, &apos;we had re-established quite close bonds. We were still a little aloof but much closer. We discussed his preparations for the trip. I remember talking about what he was going to do to keep safe.&apos;  Tom also discussed the trip with his &apos;very closest friends, who happened to be Jewish&apos;. But his attitude would have been: &apos;I want to find out for myself.&apos; It is painful listening to Anthony piecing together the past, trying to reconfigure his relationship with Tom before he died. I suggest that it was remarkable that he and Jocelyn managed to work together with such dignity. &apos;There have been enormous stresses,&apos; he admits. &apos;Don&apos;t be under any illusions about that, but I think we are now closer in many ways.&apos;  Before I leave, I hear myself asking - I hadn&apos;t meant to put it so baldly - how much Tom&apos;s death has changed his life? &apos;The whole experience has changed my view of life and of what is important,&apos; he answers. He describes being &apos;in the City, in a bar, seeing people have a good time - it seems completely unreal&apos;. He admits he has lost the taste for &apos;life&apos;s pleasures&apos;. &apos;Work is what matters.&apos; Anthony&apos;s work now is to create a forum for people to solve their legal difficulties outside the court. He finds, in this good-hearted project, an af finity with Tom. But he remains hard on himself. He believes that because of Tom&apos;s death: &apos;I am a lesser parent. I don&apos;t take the children on holidays.&apos; He bought some golf clubs: &apos;They haven&apos;t been out of the cupboard.&apos; He feels that Tom&apos;s death has made him more spiritual: &apos;I used to read to Tom in intensive care. I spent hours with him. I read the Koran for the first time and Taoism. It was a time for contemplation, working out what was important.&apos;  Gaza, he explains, was &apos;so dramatic and powerful. The best journalist cannot portray the reality of what is happening. What is an Israeli-only road? What is a checkpoint?&apos; He believes we have &apos;so little idea of what is happening&apos;. Grief, he recognises, can make you see more keenly. It has also made the political personal: &apos;I remember saying to someone [about Gaza and the Middle Eastern conflict] the Israelis can&apos;t say the problem is only theirs. This is now our issue.&apos; Jocelyn Hurndall lives in Tufnell Park, north London. She has a radiance that is immediately attractive. But faces carry their recent emotional history and her grief is as indelible as a watermark. She wonders whether we might sit in her garden. It is a is lovely, peaceful, idiosyncratic place - a shrine of sorts. I exclaim at the tiny, weeping silver birch at its centre: &apos;It was planted for Tom,&apos; she says. &apos;It&apos;s going to make me cry.&apos; &apos;Don&apos;t,&apos; I say. &apos;It&apos;s doing your weeping for you.&apos; I feel an immediate rapport with this woman whose emotions, five years on, are still so close to the surface, so available to her. In her book, she wrote: &apos;People know about death in the Middle East... it is one of the things that gives life there its vibrancy. In the West we are not forced to look death in the face in the same way - we barely acknowledge its existence. We take our lives very much for granted.&apos; Tom&apos;s death has changed that permanently: &apos;I never take my life for granted.&apos; She tells me: &apos;Tom valued the moment, the meaning of things. I respect that. It is what I have learnt from him.&apos; And after his death, she learnt that being able to &apos;meet the moment&apos; was an essential part of grieving too - not running away even from the most agonising details: the scent of Tom&apos;s clothes, the look of his handwriting.  We talk about gardening, how it insists you live in the present (but with an optimistic eye on the future). Her hands, she says, have been roughened by it, but it has helped her heart. Being able to garden is emotional progress for her. &apos;For a long while I could not look at anything beautiful - lichen, for example, that has taken a lifetime to grow on a stone. I couldn&apos;t look at the beauty of this world without thinking about what Tom had lost.&apos; The film conveys the profound alienation after Tom&apos;s death - the shock of being pitched from London into a Middle East war zone. Isn&apos;t grief itself like this; doesn&apos;t it bring with it a feeling of being in a foreign country, an attendant unreality? A sense of not being at home in your own skin? She agrees. &apos;Back then, even being with a group of friends felt foreign. You weren&apos;t able to give anything back - and that was shocking.&apos;  One insight in her book is that a family is seldom united by grief. Mourning is an individual thing, a lonely road. I can see (as Jocelyn herself recognises) that her emotional articulacy might not always have been easy for her family. And it must have been hard for her too. Looking back, she finds Anthony&apos;s grieving &apos;completely different&apos; from hers because &apos;it was so far under the surface&apos;. She says: &apos;My brain was shot. He seemed to be able to use his.&apos; Her son Billy was different again. He coped by completely rebuilding his little brother Fred&apos;s room after Tom&apos;s death, an awesome job for a boy with no formal carpenter&apos;s training. Jocelyn is still so proud of this that she takes me to inspect his handiwork.  I wonder how Jocelyn feels now about allowing a child, albeit a grown-up child, to go to a war zone. &apos;When Tom first said he was going away [Iraq was his initial destination], I froze. I could not speak when I found out my challenging, extremely bright son was planning to do this. I felt: how could he put us through this?&apos; It was a long time before she was able to respect his decision. Now she believes &apos;we learn so much from risk takers&apos;, from people not content to &apos;sit on their comfortable sofas&apos;. She remembers Tom asking her &apos;why a 21-year-old on the other side of the world should live a much more difficult life than I do in London&apos;. She salutes his thinking: &apos;He saw acceptance of difference as one of the answers to the universe,&apos; and she agrees with him: &apos;Inclusion is essential - on climate change, on banking crises. We need to think in a more global way.&apos; Since Tom&apos;s death, Jocelyn no longer works as a head of learning support at a state school. She is, instead, the director of the Middle East charity Friends of Birzeit University, which raises funds for academic scholarships for Palestinian students. &apos;It is to do with education for an oppressed group who experience barriers to learning,&apos; she says. Her daughter, Sophie, has also gravitated towards charity work; in her case, Map (Medical Aid for Palestinians). She has become an exceptionally effective campaigner (the importance of her role in the family has been written out of the film). Jocelyn hopes the film will make audiences &apos;abandon an emotional response to the conflict and make an objective attempt to open their minds to what this is really about. Highly intelligent people often lose all their logic about this conflict.&apos; It is interesting that just as Anthony wants me to know that he is emotional, she wants me to know she can be logical. But both Hurndalls want people to know what is happening in Gaza. Her eyes blaze as she describes the &apos;wanton destruction of people&apos;s homes&apos;. She wishes she could bring politicians in &apos;by the busload&apos; to see what she has seen.  And yet it is clear that Jocelyn will never find it possible to abandon the emotional response to the Middle East conflict. &apos;The life-changing moment for me was when Fred, who was only 12, was interviewed by the BBC. &quot;How do you feel?&quot; they asked him. He was standing next to Tom&apos;s blood on the ground. He was like a ghost. He said, &quot;They shot my brother, he was doing something good, he was rescuing children.&quot;&apos;  She tells me that part of Tom&apos;s legacy is the realisation that how a story is told is crucial - words matter to her, as they did to him, tremendously. It is this that suddenly reminds me to ask her about the Israeli judge who passed sentence in words so unjudiciously lyrical they take the breath away. She knows &apos;nothing about him&apos;, she says, but continues to cherish the words he chose. This was his summing up: &apos;Sergeant Wahid Taysir caused a soul to leave this world. He spilt the blood of a young man in the bloom of youth, causing the loss of an entire world. When that young man was alive, there was no one else like him, and there will never be anyone like him again.&apos; \u2022 The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will be broadcast on C4 Monday October 13 at 9pm  \u2022 Friends of Birzeit University campaigns for the educational rights of Palestinian students.

In 2003, Ari Folman, who had just turned 40, asked his commanders in the Israel Defence Forces to release him from the obligation to do a month&apos;s military service every year. They agreed - &quot;so long as you go to the army therapist and talk about everything you went through&quot;. Folman, already an acclaimed film-maker and screenwriter whose service consisted of writing army information films - &quot;How to defend yourself from atomic attack, stuff like that&quot; - began to talk to the counsellor about the most dramatic episode in his military career and one of the most divisive chapters in modern Israeli history: the Lebanon war of 1982. Folman had been just 19.  He realised that he had never spoken about the experience before. &quot;It&apos;s not that I had total amnesia about it,&quot; he says now, &quot;but I had worked very hard to repress those memories. I had the basic storyline, but there were large holes.&quot; Around the same time, Folman got a call from a friend, Boaz Rein Buskila, a fellow conscript in 1982. In a bar, the rain hammering outside, Boaz told Folman of a recurring nightmare: a pack of 26 vicious, slavering dogs stampede through a smart Tel Aviv street, upturning chairs, knocking over tables. The dream was connected to Lebanon, Boaz was certain. During the 1982 invasion, when an IDF unit tried to enter a village, their presence was often given away by the howling of dogs: Boaz, deemed too sensitive to kill a man, had been given the task of shooting any dogs on sight - to silence them in advance. He had killed 26, and remembered every one of them.  The image had haunted Boaz. Surely Folman had similar memories, similar flashbacks from Beirut? No, Folman realised. Nothing at all. There were vast gaps in his memory - and he became determined to fill them. The result is one of the most extraordinary films of this or any year; it is already bagging prizes across the world and building an Oscar buzz. Waltz With Bashir is a documentary, yet it is animated. It tells a series of true stories, yet unspools like a hallucination. It is gripping, painful, and lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It will surely take its place alongside The Battle Of Algiers and Apocalypse Now as among the very best films about conflict. For it wrestles with two of the great themes - memory and war - and dwells on the collision of the two.  The form is startlingly original. The opening sequence - those hunting dogs - establishes a visual grammar, more graphic novel than kids&apos; cartoon, that is sustained throughout. The figures do not move as they do in the Pixar movies that have raised a generation of children. Instead, they are still, &quot;cut-outs&quot; in which one limb might move while the rest remains static. The effect should be flat, but the low-tech style somehow conveys an emotional depth that catches you by surprise. The characters appear in two dimensions, yet are intensely human.  Not least because their voices are real - not those of actors, but fellow veterans of the war interviewed by Folman. Indeed, it is Folman&apos;s voice we hear most often, and we see him in both his 19-year-old and 45-year-old incarnations. In the movie, he speaks to a half-dozen former comrades in arms, along with a therapist friend, a distinguished TV reporter who covered the 1982 war and an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. It is one of the former soldiers who gives the movie its title: a man, apparently crazed after a long shootout at a Beirut junction, who grabs a weapon from a fellow conscript and begins to fire wildly, as if dancing to some internal music - the entire scene played out before a giant street painting of the Lebanese president-elect, Bashir Gemayel.  The climax of the movie, and the heart of Folman&apos;s missing memories, is the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Enraged by Bashir&apos;s assassination, Christian Phalangist gunmen went on the rampage, murdering hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian men, women and children. (Estimates of the death toll range from 700 to more than 3,000.) Folman finally remembers that he was among the IDF men ordered to launch flares into the night sky over the camps. According to Israel&apos;s own Kahan commission of inquiry, the &quot;illumination&quot; was requested by the Phalangists to help them in their grisly work - though Folman is emphatic that at the time he and the soldiers beside him &quot;had no clue what was going on: we didn&apos;t know there was a massacre&quot;.  Those events prompted a bout of introspection in Israel that has rarely been equalled. An estimated crowd of 400,000 gathered in the centre of Tel Aviv to protest. Since that represented one tenth of the entire Israeli population, proportionally at least it can claim to be the largest political demonstration in any country at any time. Kahan found the then defence minister Ariel Sharon bore &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for the Palestinian deaths and concluded that he was unfit to serve in the defence ministry (though it did not stop him becoming prime minister 19 years later).  All of this would have made compelling material in a conventional documentary, even a drama-documentary involving actors&apos; reconstructions, but Folman never doubted that this film would have to be animated: &quot;There was no other way to do it, to show memories, hallucinations, dreams. War is like a really bad acid trip, and this was the only way to show that.&quot; Once you see the film, you know what he means: Carmi Cnaa&apos;n recalls the boat ride that took him to Lebanon, how he threw up, how he then fell into sleep - &quot;I sleep when I&apos;m scared&quot; - only to dream he was rescued by a voluptuous giantess, who held him like a nursing mother as she swam away from the vessel just seconds before it was bombed from the air. In a live-action movie, such a scene would have been impossible - or absurd.  Driving the story is Folman&apos;s own quest to recover his memory, guided by his best friend-cum-therapist. Was the making of the film an act of therapy in itself? &quot;It was like scratching an old scar, an old wound,&quot; the director says, sitting in New York for yet another film festival, receiving another round of plaudits. &quot;The memories spurted out.&quot;  And not only for him. Perhaps the most striking sequence in the film tells the story of Roni Dayg, today a lab chemist for an Israeli dairy company. Back in 1982 he was a tank loader when his unit came under fire. He and his comrades fled the tank, carrying no weapons, and were picked off, one by one, by Palestinian snipers concealed in the surrounding buildings. By the time Roni reached a rock and hid behind it, the rest of the men were dead. He waited, gasping for breath. The minutes passed until the snipers emerged, some of them just yards away from Roni. Somehow they never noticed him.  He waited for nightfall, then ran towards the beach. With no clear plan, he plunged into the water and swam. And swam. And swam. An explosion struck nearby, rippling out across the water. But Roni kept swimming. Eventually, exhausted, he reached shore again. Who knew by then where he was? (In fact, despite swimming for six hours, he had covered only six kilometres.) He heard voices: they could have been Israelis, they could have been Lebanese. But the language was Hebrew. Incredibly, he had reached his very own regiment, finding them in the place to which they had retreated. He staggered on to the beach and was saved.  When I speak to Roni Dayg, he concedes the strangeness of seeing the most traumatic moment of his life drawn and animated on a big screen. But he is relieved, too. For years, he explains, he had felt awkward with the loved ones of those soldiers killed beside the beach, as if they somehow resented Dayg for having survived, as if they believed he had saved himself at his comrades&apos; expense.  &quot;I couldn&apos;t look at their families,&quot; he says. &quot;I felt responsible. Now, with this film, it&apos;s all out. This shows what happened.&quot; He&apos;s had calls from old friends, people he hadn&apos;t seen for years. &quot;And that feels good.&quot; The relief is not confined to those featured in the movie. Waltz With Bashir seems to have released something long pent up among veterans of Israel&apos;s least celebrated war - described at the time as the country&apos;s first &quot;war of choice&quot;. The film&apos;s makers say they are now constantly buttonholed by men in their 40s desperate to tell their stories of Lebanon. According to art director David Polonsky, &quot;You realise that they&apos;ve been walking around for 25 years with this life-changing experience and they&apos;ve never talked about it.&quot; This focus on the experiences of IDF veterans may bring grumbles from some of Israel&apos;s critics. Isn&apos;t Waltz With Bashir asking us, however artfully, to sympathise with the invaders of 1982, not the invaded - to somehow see the IDF, rather than the Lebanese and Palestinians of Beirut, as the victims of that war? It is not a new criticism. The spate of American antiwar movies about Vietnam were also faulted for casting young US draftees as the central casualties of the conflict, rather than the Vietnamese themselves. But there is a peculiarly Israeli dimension to the objection, too. In Hebrew they speak of &quot;shooting and crying&quot;, shorthand for the tendency to depict the Israeli soldier as morally conflicted, the reluctant warrior whose heart is broken by having to kill his enemy. Such an archetype runs through Israeli folklore and can be seen as a mechanism that allows Israelis to emerge from even their darkest episodes with their moral self-image intact.  Folman was fully alive to this risk, but is adamant that Waltz With Bashir does not succumb to it. &quot;When you watch this film, you have no doubt who the victims are.&quot; He says it&apos;s impossible to have sympathy for the IDF soldiers when you see the impact of their invasion - and this film certainly shows that impact, from the casual trashing of Beirut streets to the eventual carnage of the refugee camps.  Indeed, the catastrophe at Sabra and Shatila is given a weight that sets it apart from the rest of the film. In the final minutes, animation gives way to real-life video footage of the slaughtered - including one unbearable image of a child. In this sense, the Palestinian dead are given a three-dimensional realness denied everyone else.  Should Folman have gone further and told Palestinian stories with the same close humanity he gave to himself and his fellow Israelis? He considered it, wondered about making a &quot;Rashomon&quot; of 1982, showing the conflict from the differing viewpoints of all those involved. But it was not for him. &quot;Who am I to tell their stories?&quot; he says of the Palestinians. &quot;They have to tell their own stories.&quot; Not that Folman believes Waltz With Bashir conveys only a narrow Israeli experience. There is a universal lesson to be drawn from his film. It is that war is not Platoon or Steven Spielberg&apos;s Band Of Brothers: &quot;It has no glory, no glamour, no bravery, no brotherhood of men, nothing.&quot; Perhaps the most surprising frame of the entire movie is one of the very last: a fleeting acknowledgment of support from Israel&apos;s culture ministry and film board. Folman says that when Waltz With Bashir has played at festivals in cities around the world, local Israeli embassies have embraced it.  It&apos;s an unexpected reaction, given the unflinching depiction of Israeli brutality, IDF soldiers shooting and shooting even when they have no idea who they are shooting at. And yet it&apos;s not so hard to understand. For one thing, the Israeli soldiers in the film have had their humanity restored to them: they are not faceless killing machines but terrified young boys.  More importantly, perhaps, the film is at great pains to make crystal clear what has long been murky: exactly who did what at Sabra and Shatila. Again and again, Folman&apos;s script stresses that the massacre was committed by Christian Phalangists (who even slashed crosses into the chests of their victims). The publicity material quotes Folman thus: &quot;One thing for sure is that the Christian Phalangist militiamen were fully responsible for the massacre. The Israeli soldiers had nothing to do with it.&quot; That act of clarification is probably reason enough for Israeli officialdom to have welcomed the film.  But there is much to give them discomfort. Sharon himself is shown tucking into a massive cooked breakfast - including five fried eggs - while the killing goes on all around. Later he is notified by phone that a massacre is rumoured to be underway: he thanks his informant and does nothing. That is one of the few flashes of political anger in the film. Elsewhere, there are no statements or polemics, even though its story was given new resonance as production got underway in the summer of 2006 - with the outbreak of the second Lebanon war. Polonksy, the art director, recalls that any illusion that he and his team of animators were working on a mere &quot;artwork&quot; was shattered. &quot;It was happening in real time again; the same stupidity all over again.&quot; Could Waltz With Bashir move Israeli hearts and minds so intensely that it prevents a future war? None involved thinks so. &quot;Cinema doesn&apos;t change the world,&quot; they say. But for those who where there, they have performed a service. &quot;None of us spoke about this war,&quot; says Folman. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to open things up.&quot; \u2022 Waltz With Bashir is in cinemas from November 21.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "Waltz with Bashir film maker Ari Folman on war and art", "sentences": ["In a bar, the rain hammering outside, Boaz told Folman of a recurring nightmare: a pack of 26 vicious, slavering dogs stampede through a smart Tel Aviv street, upturning chairs, knocking over tables.", "An estimated crowd of 400,000 gathered in the centre of Tel Aviv to protest."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/25/waltz-with-bashir-ari-folman"}, {"tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Culture", "Sadler's Wells"], "article": "The Batsheva Dance Company, based in Tel Aviv, was founded in 1964 by Martha Graham and Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild.

His large, imposing frame and bullet-like bald head make the new president of the Palestinian Football Association resemble an ageing prizefighter, which in some ways he is. Whilst most football administrators cut their teeth in bureaucratic hell, Rajoub has a far more colourful and controversial past. By the age of 17 he had been sentenced to life in jail for throwing a grenade at Israeli troops. At 33 he was exiled to Lebanon and by the time of the second intifada he had risen through the Fatah ranks to become Yasser Arafat&apos;s trusted national security adviser, building a reputation as the West Bank&apos;s internal &apos;hard man&apos; while also being known as a political moderate opposed to attacks on Israeli soil. Yet for the past six months Rajoub has been involved in one of the hardest scraps of his life: trying to bring international football to Palestine for the first time. This weekend was a momentous occasion for the Palestinians after it was announced that, finally, the national team would be allowed to play a home game in the West Bank, a remarkable feat almost entirely attributable to Rajoub, who has had to overcome more than a decade of failure, exile and broken dreams. Yet when Fifa tentatively recognised Palestine in the mid 1990s, it was a cause for massive celebration in the West Bank and Gaza. Fifa was, after all, one of the only international bodies to recognise Palestine&apos;s existence. Games couldn&apos;t be played at home, Fifa deemed it too dangerous, but there was no shortage of Arab capitals willing to show Palestinian solidarity, and Amman and Doha became their new home as the team launched a bid to reach the World Cup finals. Qualification, the Palestinians reasoned, would be a damn sight more effective for the cause of national self-determination than almost anything else. By 2004 they were ready for a crack at the 2006 finals in Germany. It started well for them too. Fifa had relaxed rules on citizenship meaning that the Palestinians could call on their massive Diaspora to fill the team sheet. Adverts were put into magazines in Germany, Chile and the United States to attract players. A multinational squad was assembled, followed by an 8-0 thumping of Chinese Taipei and then a respectable 1-1 draw with Iraq. Then the wheels fell off.  Movement restrictions between Gaza and the West Bank, not to mention the restrictions within them, meant the team could rarely train together. Training camps were set up in Egypt, but the players from Gaza would rarely get through Israeli checkpoints. The coaching staff, realising that nine-man training sessions probably weren&apos;t great preparation for a World Cup qualifier, started picking more players from the West Bank, breeding resentment amongst the two groups of players and effectively creating two different national teams. The nail in the coffin came when the team was denied permission to leave Palestine to play Uzbekistan. The Palestinians, without their Gaza contingent, could only scrape together 10 players. It was a miracle they lost only 3-0. The campaign was over, the Palestinian dream of statehood through the back door shattered. Palestinian football went into decline. The West Bank&apos;s football league was suspended as it was almost impossible to fulfil any fixtures when there were so many checkpoints to negotiate. If the fans managed to get to the game, it was unlikely that one of the teams, or sometimes even the referee, would make it.  The Gaza league, though, continued unmolested, one of the few areas other than tunnel construction to benefit from Israel&apos;s unilateral pull-out from the strip. The team&apos;s efforts to reach the 2010 World Cup finals also ended on the desk of an Israeli bureaucrat. They were eventually eliminated when the team couldn&apos;t get visas for a qualifier against Singapore last October. The FA pleaded that movement restrictions had again stopped the players from travelling, but its objections fell on deaf ears and Fifa awarded the match 3-0 to Singapore. Then Rajoub came riding to the rescue in May, driven by his trademark ruthlessness and a single-minded objective of giving Palestine home advantage for the first time in its history. &quot;From the first moment I was elected as president I started organising to have a match here between our first national team with any team that would play us,&quot; he explains as multiple phones go off around him. &quot;In my first meeting with [Fifa president] Sepp Blatter in May, I asked him and the process began. He said OK and would sponsor such a match and then the deputy president [of the FA] of Jordan approached us.  &quot;But to be fair many, many teams approached us to be the first team to play in Palestine but our brothers in Jordan insisted and they deserve to be the first one to play the match because they have helped us so much and contributed to where we are today.&quot; It&apos;s apt that Jordan were the first team to play in Palestine, and not just because Amman became a temporary home for the team. It is estimated that up to 80% of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, and a number of the players from the national team trace their origins back to the West Bank and what is now modern day Israel.  Even Jordan&apos;s most popular team, current champions Wihdat, have a strong Palestinian identity. The owner is a Palestinian-born Christian MP in the Jordanian parliament and the club are based in the Palestinian Wihdat refugee camp in Amman. The fan&apos;s most popular chant is &quot;Allah, Wihdat, Al Quds Arabi&quot; (God, Wihat, Jerusalem [for the] Arabs). Yet it was touch and go whether the match would take place at all. As you&apos;d expect in a part of the world where politics seeps into every action, organising the game had become something of a logistical nightmare. To start with the West Bank has very few grass pitches, let alone stadiums, so a new home for Palestinian football needed to be found.  Rajoub began by travelling to Israel and meeting with sympathetic Knesset members to build support for a new national stadium, built next to the Green Line on the edge of East Jerusalem in Al Ram, a stone&apos;s throw from the separation barrier that divides the landscape. Palestinian Authority policemen were not allowed to patrol the area so a special deal had to be struck with the Israelis to allow them to police the stadium. Then there was the slew of dignitaries to be taken care of. Blatter was in town to admire his handiwork: it was money from Fifa&apos;s Goal project that paid for the stadium&apos;s completion. But the main problems giving Rajoub headaches were the same problems that have afflicted all of his predecessors: getting the players to the games. As the national team is split in two, travel permission had to be sought from the Israelis. Six players from Gaza were denied permission to travel to the game, including the team&apos;s captain, Saed Jundiyah, who the Israeli&apos;s deemed a &quot;security risk&quot;.  The last time I met him, at a football tournament in Jordan last summer, he had the opposite problem: he was stuck in Jordan, denied permission to get back into Gaza. But most worryingly for Rajoub, the Jordanian national team had been detained at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank. While most would buckle under the pressure, Rajoub knows a thing or two about operating under tough conditions. &quot;Listen, you know my background: I am a Palestinian fighter. Wherever I go I make order and I make action plans,&quot; he said 48 hours before the match, as his staff made frantic phone calls to try to ease the Jordanians&apos; passage.  &quot;I define what I want and make sure the means are there to assure my ends and my goals. This is what I got as chief of security, national security adviser, and when I was in the underground resistance. I&apos;ve used the experience of my past and my contacts to ensure we&apos;ve got what we wanted.&quot; It was for these qualities that Rajoub secured his almost unanimous election as head of the Palestinian FA, in itself an interesting move given his past and the continuing enmity between Hamas and Fatah factions. He is one of Fatah&apos;s most important operators and was even spoken of as a potential president after Yasser Arafat&apos;s death. But Islamic Jihad and Hamas have criticised him in the past for instigating occasional purges to halt attacks against Israeli targets. &quot;There were some concerns,&quot; Rajoub admitted. &quot;But I was elected by all the political factions, extreme right, extreme left, PFLP [the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], Palestine Democratic Union, everyone. I am proud of that and I think football should not be used to divide and should present all the Palestinian people as one. There is no political affiliation in the team, it is a national issue.&quot; His stock has risen to such a level that reports earlier this month suggested that he had travelled to Gaza for secret security talks with deposed Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya. Whether this footballing d\u00e9tente between the two factions spreads to other areas is another issue entirely.  Just east over the separation barrier, a little over an hour&apos;s drive to the coast, is the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv, the home of Israeli football. Palestine might look to Asia, and Israel Europe, but could the two teams ever play each other in Jerusalem in a peace match, I ask. Rajoub is cautious. &quot;First of all on the national level we are playing an active role to bridge the internal gap between the competing [Hamas and Fatah] factions and I think we are making a success of this but it&apos;s up to the Israel,&quot; he said. &quot;Do they want peace, security, settlements, checkpoints or occupation?  &quot;The core message we want to give the international community is values, competition without violence and bloodshed. It is up to the Israelis to decide. We cannot co-operate on the one hand and then, on the other, live under restrictions and internal arrest.&quot; Yet you get the feeling that, with Rajoub at the helm, anything is now possible. He has already achieved more for Palestinian football, and Palestinian national unity, than almost anyone else in the past few years.  &quot;I have a strategy for the next four years [but] I am using all my effort, all my power just to get through the next 48 hours, let me cross this bridge first,&quot; he explained, no pun intended. &quot;The Israelis are still preventing the Jordanian national team from crossing over. It&apos;s Friday. The match is Sunday so the challenge is very huge. See what can go wrong? Let&apos;s see if we make it through the next 48 hours my friend, and then I&apos;ll concentrate on what come next.&quot; And he did make it through. In the end the last-minute diplomacy worked. The Israelis let the Jordanian team through and a packed Faisal al Husseini Stadium reverberated to chants of &quot;Football is more noble than war&quot; as Palestine took an early lead, only to be pegged back. It finished 1-1, a good result against a team 68 places above them in the Fifa rankings. But, as it always is for Palestine, the result didn&apos;t really matter.

Yigal Amir shot Rabin at the end of a peace rally in Tel Aviv. Amir opposed the 1993 Oslo peace accord Rabin signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which involved returning war-won land. He told Israel&apos;s Channel 10 TV he was spurred into action by comments from Ariel Sharon, Rehavam Zeevi and Rafael Eitan, who at the time were leading rightwing politicians with long, distinguished military careers. Asked who had an impact on his decision to kill Rabin, Amir replied: &quot;Sharon, Raful, Gandhi, all of the people who understand the military and said this agreement would bring a disaster.&quot; Raful and Gandhi were the nicknames for Eitan and Zeevi respectively . Sharon went on to become Israel&apos;s prime minister and in 2005, ended Israel&apos;s 38-year occupation of the Gaza Strip before he was rendered comatose by a stroke. Zeevi was assassinated by a Palestinian militant in 2001 and Eitan was killed when he was washed into a stormy Mediterranean in 2004. Excerpts from Amir&apos;s interview were broadcast on Thursday with the full account due yesterday. The station decided not to air the full interview after the excerpts set off an uproar for giving exposure to Amir, in violation of a prison service ban on talking to the media. Channel 2, which also interviewed Amir, scrubbed its broadcast, due yesterday. After Rabin&apos;s assassination, many in Israel blamed hardline politicians and hawkish rabbis for creating a divisive political climate that encouraged the killer. But Amir said he paid little attention to the rabbis. &quot;You don&apos;t need a rabbi for that. It&apos;s not a matter of a rabbi,&quot; he said. Amir, who is serving a life sentence, said he realised that killing Rabin would be relatively simple when he attended the wedding of a friend. Amir was armed with a pistol, and Rabin was also there, protected by a single bodyguard. &quot;If I could shake his hand, I could have easily shot him,&quot; Amir said. Amir gave telephone interviews to Channel 10 and Channel 2 under the guise of conversations with his wife from his cell. As punishment for giving interviews without permission, Israel&apos;s prisons authority moved Amir to solitary confinement in a different prison. He has been forbidden to use the telephone, receive visitors or hold conjugal visits with his wife, a statement said. While in prison, Amir married an admirer, Larissa Trimbobler, and the two had a son last year. Politicians criticised the TV stations. Zevulun Orlev, of the settler-affiliated National Union party, told Israel Radio: &quot;The interviews with this despicable murderer broke the quarantine and the social exclusion that have rightly been put on Yigal Amir.&quot; The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, commended the stations for scrapping the full interviews. &quot;The broadcast of the interviews would have offended many people, especially on the eve of the annual memorial day for Yitzhak Rabin,&quot; Olmert said.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-01T00:01:00Z", "title": "Rabin's assassin says he was spurred by hawkish generals", "sentences": ["Yigal Amir shot Rabin at the end of a peace rally in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/01/israel-and-the-palestinians-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Fashion"], "article": "Last month I wrote about the first and only Palestinian keffiyeh scarf factory, which is struggling to survive even though this symbol of the Palestinian national struggle went from anti-war accessory to high street fashion item.

Back then, Israel didn&apos;t go for the scarf as fashion item, which I&apos;d assumed was because the keffiyeh&apos;s unequivocal political significance was just a bit too close for comfort. But now women have started wearing the scarf in a fashion-y manner, while some of Tel Aviv&apos;s boutiques have draped the scarf, fashionista style, around shop window mannequins.  &quot;I think it looks nice, that&apos;s why I wear it,&quot; says one 23-year-old woman in Tel Aviv who is channelling the scarf much like the American celebrity chef Rachael Ray did for a subsequently banned advert earlier this year. &quot;We learned it was fashionable from Europe,&quot; says 18-year-old Kineret, at a central shopping centre, also sporting the keffiyeh as street-trend. Both of these women say they know what the scarf represents and are not wearing it as a political statement.  But why the time delay? It&apos;s not a seasonal issue, since Israeli teenage girls were wearing fashion-conscious vest-and-cotton-scarf combinations in the stickiest summer months.

One of the most controversial wars in Israel&apos;s short history is in full flow. In an area of west Beirut under Israeli army control, thousands of Palestinian refugees are slaughtered by Lebanese Christian Phalangist militiamen. Twenty years will pass before director Ari Folman, a young Israeli soldier at the time, begins a journey into his repressed past and returns to the days of the notorious Sabra and Shatila massacre. It will take him four more years of intensive film-making with a talented team of illustrators and animators before he delivers the result: the animated documentary Waltz with Bashir, Israel&apos;s most praised film in recent years. The film, which won six Israeli Film Academy awards and is Israel&apos;s official entry for best foreign film in next year&apos;s Oscars, has been at the centre of a cacophony of reviews, talkbacks and personal exchange since its domestic release last June. In one of the recurring scenes, naked figures emerge from the sea at Beirut, rifles hanging across their bony torsos. They seem cut off from the atrocities taking place nearby. Shades of black and orange dominate the background and eerie music plays. There is no dialogue, only haunting images of tormented men reaching a tormented place. This silence has been mirrored by audiences in Israeli cinemas. It lingers until long after the end credits have rolled; and it settled on my colleagues and me as we left a London preview screening, struggling to gather our thoughts and feelings into words. My older brother was a soldier in Lebanon in 1982. I was 12 years old and I remember only fragmentary details: my mother keeping herself frantically busy (her way, she would later say, of coping with &apos;maternal worries&apos;); the cherries my brother brought from Lebanon when he came back on leave; the names of &apos;fallen&apos; soldiers on the TV screen each evening before the news; and the 400,000-strong demonstration in Tel Aviv after the atrocities in Sabra and Shatila were exposed. My cousin was killed while on reserve duty in Tyre; all I remember was the car that brought the news and took my father to his bereaved sister. For years, Ariel Sharon, Israel&apos;s defence minister at the time of the 1982 invasion, was the ultimate villain in our household, but we never really talked about my brother&apos;s experience in Lebanon. In 2001, the national psyche exercised its formidable forgetfulness once again as the majority of Israelis voted Sharon Prime Minister. &apos;I know so little about these events,&apos; said one of my companions at the screening. &apos;I tried to remember where I was when this war took place, but I can&apos;t.&apos; Regardless of where we were at the time, Waltz with Bashir makes us all reflect on this past from where we are now - still entrenched in a bloody Middle East. It also invites us to contemplate how Israel&apos;s past has been represented in film. Even before the establishment of Israel in 1948, and until the early Sixties, films did engage with Israel&apos;s military struggle to establish its own state and survival, but usually in the context of a hostile and indistinguishable Arab mass, one labelled as the ultimate enemy. Israeli fighters were depicted as heroes. The few feature films made in Israel up to the Sixties, such as Hill 24 Doesn&apos;t Answer, the iconic 1955 film about the 1948 war by British director Thorold Dickinson, were clearly part of the collective effort to justify the Zionist cause and foster a strong national identity. The focus on the external threat and the battle for survival shifted during the Sixties. Israeli cinema turned its lenses to internal matters, notably the massive migration and the cultural diversity of the newly formed society. It wasn&apos;t until the Eighties that Israeli cinema acknowledged a Palestinian people and individual Palestinians - a development termed &apos;the return of the repressed&apos; by leading film scholar Ella Shohat. While the first Lebanon war raged in 1982, creating ever larger rifts within Israeli-Jewish society, Israeli films brought Palestinian stories onto the screen for the first time.  Daniel Waxman&apos;s Hamsin (1982) and On a Narrow Bridge by Nissim Dayan (1985) both engage with love stories between mixed couples, while Uri Barbash&apos;s Beyond the Walls, which received an Oscar nomination in 1984, used the prison drama genre to dramatise a powerful alliance between Jewish and Palestinian prisoners as they fight together against the establishment.  The &apos;Palestinian Wave&apos; of the Eighties, however significant culturally, had limited popular appeal. Israeli cinema entered the Nineties with some critical zeal but it was more concerned with domestic issues than with confronting the national conflict head on. However, the groundwork for the flourishing Israeli cinema of today was laid during the Nineties, thanks to the establishment of film schools and film funds, shifts in local broadcasting, which created many more opportunities for local film-makers (before 1993, Israel had only one TV channel), and finally the New Cinema Law of 2000, which allocated significant public funding to the film industry. But what are the politics of this recent prosperity? Or rather, where are its politics? Some of the most recent successes have had little to do with the conflict. Late Marriage, the new wave&apos;s first box-office hit, from 2001, deals with the tensions between tradition and modernity within a close-knit Georgian-Israeli community. Nir Bergman&apos;s drama Broken Wings exposes a family&apos;s domestic difficulties after the sudden death of the father as the result of a bee sting. Avi Nesher&apos;s Turn Left at the End of the World, set among two migrant families in a development town in the late Sixties, harks back to the romantic Zionist idea of the Israeli &apos;melting pot&apos;. These dramas were confined to the &apos;safe territories&apos; of Israeli-Jewish society, limited mainly to urban landscapes and appealing to universal sentiments of family, romance and cultural differences. Some critics welcomed these trends as a sign that Israeli film-makers were finally thinking beyond the burden of national political concerns. However, this was not an option for the Palestinian-Israeli film-makers, who were also making their mark in the late Nineties and after. In films such as Chronicle of a Disappearance and Divine Intervention, both by Elia Suleiman, and Hany Abu-Assad&apos;s Oscar-nominated Paradise Now, the land of Israel/Palestine is marked by borders and boundaries that profoundly shape its inhabitants, who can only dwell on the multiple layers of the national conflict. Similar ground has been covered in documentaries by Israeli-Jewish film-makers. An early example is Amos Gitai&apos;s The House, from 1980, which touched on one of the great taboos - the effects of the 1948 war of independence on the Palestinians. It traced the history of a house in west Jerusalem, owned until 1948 by a Palestinian family. In recent years, the number of documentaries reflecting critically on the conflict has swelled: they include The Inner Tour (Ra&apos;anan Alexandrowicz, 2001); Wall (Simone Bitton, 2004); and Avenge But One of My Two Eyes (Avi Mograbi, 2005). It is almost solely in documentaries that one can see Palestinian people and be exposed to their experiences and points of view. The individual figure of the Palestinian, with a name and a face, disappeared from Israeli feature films after the first Palestinian uprising in the late Eighties and has only rarely re-emerged in Israeli dramas since. Signs of a change are emerging, however. A number of recent popular Israeli films, including Close to Home, the Oscar-nominated Beaufort, Lemon Tree and Waltz with Bashir, deal with the national conflict as it plays into the lives of individuals in the region. (All of these films have been, or are soon to be, on general release in the UK.) Of these, only Lemon Tree portrays a Palestinian experience and narrative. Co-written by Eran Riklis and the Palestinian-Israeli Suha Arraf, it tells the story of a Palestinian widow whose lemon grove is about to be uprooted by the Israeli army, due to its proximity to the newly built home of Israel&apos;s defence minister. The film establishes a powerful relationship between the widow and the minister&apos;s wife. The film, which continues to gain awards and large audiences across the world, had only limited commercial success in Israel. Joseph Cedar&apos;s Beaufort tells the story of Israeli soldiers in the last weeks before the Israeli retreat from Lebanon in 2000, but its romantic portrayal of young male soldiers, typical of more traditional war films, undermines the film&apos;s stated anti-war declarations. Waltz with Bashir, on the other hand, never falls into the cliche of male comradeship in times of war, even though the story is told from an Israeli point of view. &apos;War films miss the mark of being anti-war,&apos; director Ari Folman has said. &apos;When you watch films like that at the age of 15, you tell yourself that war is terrible but the soldiers are cool, heroic. I absolutely did not want kids to wish they were like the characters in the movie, including me... There is none of the Israeli glitter of war, no hyping of the fighters. Everyone is a classic anti-hero.&apos; In the film, war and its aftermath are shown as the loneliest of experiences, devoid of shared memories or references. This alienation resonates in the innovative use of animation to recall, convey and construct true events from the past. The &apos;animated documentary&apos; hybrid builds a critical distance between the audience and the events on the screen yet, paradoxically, this makes them more accessible: we can get up close to the evils of war and still reflect on them. Waltz... is a film about difficult and often traumatic repressed memories that haunt men decades after the events. It is also about individuals who live within a society that cultivates certain memories while relegating others to oblivion, hardly ever stopping to question the price. It has certainly touched a nerve in Israel. One hundred thousand people have seen the film since its release in June and it has received huge media attention. Some critics have assigned it to the genre of &apos;shooting and crying&apos;: films that focus on the suffering of Israeli soldiers while shying away from the Palestinian victims of the conflict, not ready to take responsibility for their role in creating and maintaining the tragic circumstances they lament. Others celebrated the unique treatment of significant historical events, praising how Waltz... made it possible to recall a difficult past.  The act of remembering and reflecting on military experiences is present in other recent Israeli films about the bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tamar Yarom&apos;s award-winning documentary To See If I&apos;m Smiling narrates the testimonies of six Israeli women soldiers who served in the occupied territories. Avi Mograbi&apos;s &apos;musical documentary&apos;, Z32, which premiered this year at Cannes, is dedicated to the confession of an Israeli soldier who killed two innocent Palestinian policemen to avenge the death of Israeli soldiers. At the end of Folman&apos;s journey into his past, he is finally able to integrate his memories into his own biography. They have a shape, a place and even a sound. This is clearly a brave achievement. The question is: what he will do with these memories now that they have reached the surface? This same question must be asked of the Israeli public, who have clearly been touched by this animated journey. Will these exposed memories shed further light on the mechanism that so powerfully creates our shared history and collective identity? Will they change the way Israelis reflect on their past? In an emotional speech at the Israeli Academy Awards ceremony, Folman dedicated Waltz with Bashir to the children born to the film crew during the years of filming. He said: &apos;I hope that when they grow up, in 15 years&apos; time, they will see this film on the big screen and it will have nothing to do with their lives.&apos; Reflecting on my childhood memories through the imagery of Folman&apos;s remarkable film, I find myself wishing not for a pain-free, &apos;context-liberated&apos; animation, but rather for one that can still hold a mirror to our own reflections 15 years from now. Whether these reflections will empower us to act and help us assume responsibility for our state of being remains to be seen. \u2022 Waltz with Bashir, Lemon Tree and To See If I&apos;m Smiling will screen at the UK Jewish Film Festival, 8-20 November, in London cinemas, ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk. Waltz with Bashir is released on November 21, Lemon Tree on December 12 Israel on screen: The milestones Exodus (1960) Based on Leon Uris&apos;s sweeping novel, Otto Preminger&apos;s epic saga (featuring Sal Mineo) is about the founding of Israel in the days after the Second World War. Paul Newman starred as Ari Ben Canaan, the commander of the Exodus ship bringing 600 European Jews from British-blockaded Cyprus into the newly partitioned Palestine. Sallah Shabati (1964) Brought Chaim Topol to world notice and became Israel&apos;s first big national cinema hit. It received an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe. It concerned a large Jewish family from an Arab country arriving during the wave of immigration to Israel in the Fifties and the native Israelis&apos; snobbish resistance to the newcomers.  Bourekas films Named after a light pastry delicacy, the Bourekas films of the Seventies are the most popular movies made in Israel. Although critically derided, these farcical, Carry On-like comedies and over-acted melodramas had low production values and usually depicted tensions between Mizrahi or Sephardi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former being canny but poor, the latter conceited and arrogant. Boaz Davidson was the most successful director, gaining international fame in 1978 when his crude teen hit Lemon Popsicle was successfully dubbed into English and distributed on the nascent VHS market. Raid on Entebbe (1977) An all-star cast included Charles Bronson, Jack Warden and Robert Loggia and featured Peter Finch&apos;s final role, playing future Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The action centred on the Israeli army&apos;s 500-strong commando response to the hijack of an Air France plane given permission to land at Entebbe airport in Uganda. An Israeli Top Gun, the film was used as a recruitment drive and, despite accusations of propagandism, it did much to encourage a new world-view of Israel as the little country with which you shouldn&apos;t mess. Kadosh (1998) and Kippur (2000) Director Amos Gitai established himself at the forefront of Israel&apos;s new cinema when these films became international arthouse successes after appearing in the Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival, paving the way for Israeli film&apos;s current renaissance. Kadosh was one of the first films to criticise Israel&apos;s orthodox religious community of Mea Shearim, while Kippur was one of the first renderings of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, set in the Golan Heights and featuring a helicopter crash similar to one suffered by the director.Jason Solomons", "publicationDate": "2008-11-02T00:01:00Z", "title": "Gali Gold examines how Israel's film-makers have tackled their nation's turbulent times", "sentences": ["I was 12 years old and I remember only fragmentary details: my mother keeping herself frantically busy (her way, she would later say, of coping with &apos;maternal worries&apos;); the cherries my brother brought from Lebanon when he came back on leave; the names of &apos;fallen&apos; soldiers on the TV screen each evening before the news; and the 400,000-strong demonstration in Tel Aviv after the atrocities in Sabra and Shatila were exposed."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/uk-jewish-film-festival-animation"}, {"tags": ["Top 100 city tips", "Cultural trips", "Mexico City holidays", "Mexico holidays", "Zurich holidays", "Switzerland holidays", "Sao Paulo holidays", "Brazil holidays", "Istanbul holidays", "Turkey holidays", "Washington DC holidays", "United States holidays", "Dublin holidays", "Ireland holidays", "Lisbon holidays", "Portugal holidays", "Wellington holidays", "New Zealand holidays", "Budapest holidays", "Hungary holidays", "Tel Aviv holidays", "Israel holidays", "Travel", "Short breaks", "Weekend breaks", "Hotels", "City breaks"], "article": "Mexico City  by David Vincent  &apos;When you have finished at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda, I&apos;ll meet you outside by the stone sculpture,&quot; my architect friend Manolo Mestre tells me after suggesting a trip to a few of the cultural gems where Capitalinos, not tourists, hang out. Only one problem. There are quite a few stone sculptures outside this remarkable museum - mostly pre-Colombian, and very, very large. I finally find Manolo behind a 30ft-high Tlaloc monolith. Manolo, a 6ft 2in blond-haired Mexican monolith himself, who has built houses for Francis Ford Coppola, Isabel Goldsmith and Bond Girl Luciana Paluzzi, immediately whisks me south to the cobbled streets of the colonial San Angel and its eponymous inn, a 17th-century hacienda that was originally a Carmelite monastery. &quot;But I thought you were going to take me to some of your favourite cultural spots,&quot; I protest.  &quot;Yes, but first lunch. Time to get you some huitlacoche,&quot; he replies. I felt in no position to argue despite being warned off huitlacoche, a fungus that grows on corn and whose meaning in Aztec is raven&apos;s excrement, by an American friend. But in Mexico it is considered a delicacy. Our first stop after lunch is the Museo Soumaya. Multi-billionaire Carlos Slim&apos;s eclectic collection of Rodin sculptures - more than 70 of them - and works by Renoir, Degas, van Gogh, Murillo, El Greco, Mir\u00f3, Tamayo and Rivera, is often overlooked by those rushing to the Zoc\u00e1lo and the Museo Arte Moderno. &quot;That&apos;s a mistake,&quot; says Manolo.  As we clap eyes on a 1954 mural by Rufino Tamayo at the entrance to the museum. I see his point. This is one of the most impressive private collections in the world. There are marbles, bronzes, terracottas and plasters by Rodin every which way.  &quot;It&apos;s wonderful, but what I want to show you today,&quot; says Manolo, &quot;is the fashion show Moda y Modernidad.&quot; The study of the metamorphosis of fashion from 1780 to 1950 has just opened to much fanfare in Mexico City. Pieces by couturiers Paul Poiret, Christian Dior and Cristobal Balenciaga spread throughout the permanent collection, juxtaposed against the art and sculpture that was being created at the same time. There&apos;s a Poiret, Dufy-inspired fauvist dress next to the work of Vlaminck On our way back to the city centre, we make a pit stop at the Casa Luis Barragan, a hidden museum in the Tacubaya district that was once the home of Barragan, one of Mexico&apos;s most influential 20th-century architects. The entrance hallway is dark and narrow with a small yellow glass window giving the only light. The lobby is much larger and with a volcanic stone floor that makes you feel as if you are standing in an outdoor courtyard. A small door brings us into an enormous living room, its windows framing the outside garden as if it were an artwork itself. Before I have time to salivate over the gold leaf abstract altarpiece by Mathias Goeritz, Manolo has me out the front door and on to the Centro Cultural Bella Epoca, a 32,000 sq ft cultural centre in the Condesa neighbourhood. The building, an old art deco cinema was restored by Mexican architect Teodoro Gonz\u00e1lez de Le\u00f3n, and now includes the largest bookstore in Latin America, a small art house cinema and an art gallery. &quot;Look up!&quot; instructs Manolo. The entire ceiling of the store is an illuminated glass art installation. It must be 20,000 sq ft. &quot;It&apos;s designed by Dutch artist Jan Hendrix and explores natural forms and Arab writing,&quot; says Manolo.  As we leave, Manolo takes me over to the Mexican cookery section and says with a smile: &quot;There&apos;s a book here with a recipe for huitlacoche.&quot; I buy it - for my American friend.

It houses the world&apos;s largest collection of Giacomettis and the largest number of Edvard Munchs outside Norway, It also has a Chagall gallery, important pictures by Picasso and two of Monet&apos;s waterlilies. The more modern stuff, including work by Rothko, Twombly, Beuys and Bacon is also splendid. Also worth a visit is the Haus Konstruktiv gallery in an old power station.

In addition to the simple, stunning architecture of buildings like Niemeyer&apos;s white, wedge-shaped music auditorium and the concrete dome of the OCA folklore museum, which was refurbished by Pritzker winner Paulo Mendes da Rocha, the park also contains Lina Bo Bardi&apos;s Modern Art Museum (MAM), the first of its kind in Latin America, and the Contemporary Art Museum, where the S\u00e3o Paulo biennales are held. \u2022 auditorioibirapuera.com.br; mam.org.br; macvirtual.usp.br.

Istanbul Sefer Caglar, furniture designer  Probably the most significant event in the contemporary cultural scene here was the opening of Istanbul Modern in 2004. It is the city&apos;s first dedicated modern art gallery and took almost 15 years to get permission to open - it&apos;s no coincidence that permission came when Turkey started negotiating for membership of the EU. It houses a permanent exhibition that covers Turkish visual arts over the last 100 years plus three or four visiting international exhibitions every year. There are also photography and video installations as well as a cinema. It is housed in an old warehouse building that has been given a sleek redesign. Another alternative is Galerist.

Washington DC Nilay Lawson, artist This city is jammed with cultural institutions that all the guides cover, so I&apos;m going to recommend something a bit offbeat. The first is a Brutalist church designed for the Christian Scientists by Araldo Cossutta, who worked with IM Pei. It&apos;s basically a squat, unwelcoming concrete fortress and the congregation apparently hate it, but can&apos;t get rid of it because it&apos;s a protected landmark. It&apos;s completely unapologetic and anti-bourgeois and I love it. My other suggestion would be to take in the impromptu drumming session that takes place every Sunday morning in Meridian Hill Park - known unofficially as Malcolm X Park. \u2022 Third Church of Christ, 900 16th St (thirdchurchdc.org); Meridian Hill Park, 16th St between Florida Ave &amp; Euclid St (nps.gov/mehi).

Dublin Barry Sheehan, designer Not everyone would recommend a 1940s bus station to tourists, but Bus\u00e1rus (literally &quot;bus house&quot;) is pretty special if you&apos;re a fan of modernist architecture. It was one of the first modern public buildings built in Europe after the war; it was Ove Arup&apos;s first international project, the architect, Michael Scott, is Ireland&apos;s most famous and I think it&apos;s simply beautiful. Sticking with the modern, don&apos;t miss the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) in Kilmainham, housed in an old hospital. It always has world-class exhibitions of painting and sculpture, photography and video. \u2022 Bus\u00e1ras, Store St (modernart.ie).

Marz - Galeria is a beautiful new space made up of a series of white boxes designed by Miguel Vieira Baptista. The artists it represents are some of the most playful and thought provoking in Lisbon, and the range of guest artists (which will soon include me!) is always interesting. Visitors must also visit the National Museum of Ancient Art. It is the best collection of Portuguese art from the middle ages to the early 19th century plus paintings by major European artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer. It also has a beautiful garden with a view to the river Tagus, where you can have lunch or tea. \u2022 marz.biz; mnarteantiga-ipmuseus.pt.

Wellington Suzie Moncrieff, artist/fashion designer The coolest contemporary art space in Wellington is the City Gallery. It has no permanent collection, instead it hosts all the big visiting international exhibitions. However it&apos;s closed until Spring 2009 for a major refurbishment. The other major cultural venue is Te Papa Tongarewa on the waterfront, the innovative national museum that opened 10 years ago and revolutionised the idea of how a national museum should look. It&apos;s big on interactivity while covering New Zealand&apos;s nature, art, history and heritage - with a particular focus on Maori treasures. It also has its own marae, or communal meeting place, unique in a museum. \u2022 citygallery.org.nz; tepapa.govt.nz. Stay at Rawhiti B&amp;B (0064 4 934 4859, rawhiti.co.nz) doubles from NZ$230. Budapest Attila F Kovacs, set and interior designer/architect  The House of Terror is a mansion on Budapest&apos;s main thoroughfare that was the HQ of the Hungarian Nazi Arrow Cross party and used as a prison and torture centre in the early 1940s. When the Soviets took over in 1945 the communist police used it for the same purpose. In 2002, I was hired to design a museum on the site to memorialise the crimes of the Double Occupation. The most obvious design element is the Terror stencil jutting from the roofline.

As vice-chairman of Democrats Abroad \u2013 Israel, I have given many interviews in the past few months to the Israeli and international media. On the morning of November 5, the day after the elections, I found myself on the roof of the Arab-owned Aboulafiya Restaurant in Old Jaffa with a breathtaking view of the Mediterranean beach and the Tel Aviv shoreline. As a powerful reflection of the changes taking place in the Middle East media landscape, the interview was being carried out by al-Jazeera, which has offices in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The crew, an English woman, a New Zealander and some Israeli Jews and Arabs, reminded me of the types that were drawn to Abie Nathan&apos;s Voice of Peace radio station, motivated by a mixture of adventure and idealism (and unlike the Voice of Peace, presumably a decent salary). In constant contact with the al-Jazeera base in the Qatari capital Doha, a live broadcast was bouncing back and forth from Gaza to Ramallah to Tel Aviv. The counterpart commentator representing the Israeli right was former Israeli ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon, who recently came out of the closet as an extreme rightwinger, joining Avigdor Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beiteinu party.  I said in the interview that, from the perspective of my dual role as vice-chairman of DA Israel and co-editor of the Palestine-Israel Journal, Obama&apos;s victory creates new opportunities for progress in the Middle East, and in the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Arab peace process. While noting that no one should doubt the Obama administration will maintain the so-called &quot;special relationship&quot; between the US and Israel, the important thing is that in addition to providing political, military and economic support, his administration has committed itself to being engaged, from the beginning, in helping to promote the peace process. And I added that this should and will be based on active cooperation with Europe and the Arab Peace Initiative. To expand on these thoughts there are three basic political components needed to move the peace process forward: Israeli, a Palestinian and an American components.  The Obama-Biden victory means that the American component is in place. McCain and his advisers wanted to put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the back burner, to stay the course until victory in Iraq, and were opposed any US involvement in Israeli-Syrian negotiation. Obama and his senior advisers on Israeli-Arab affairs, former American ambassadors Dr Dennis Ross and Dr Daniel Kurtzer, are all in favour of an active US involvement in facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian negotiating tracks. The Peace Index monthly public opinion poll run by Tel Aviv University also consistently reflects the fact that a clear majority of the Israeli public accepts and supports an active US involvement in the peace process. The other two components are more problematic. Unfortunately after Olmert&apos;s resignation as prime minister, the foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, was unable to reestablish the centre-left coalition that would have enabled an immediate continuation of the negotiations from the Israeli side. The current polls suggest that Livni&apos;s Kadima Party and opposition leader Benyamin Netanyahu&apos;s Likud Party are essentially tied, with about 30 seats each out of the 120 in the Knesset. So at this point it is not clear whether there will be a centre-left government, which would continue the negotiations, or a centre-right government, which would pose major obstacles for a continuation. On the Palestinian side, the negotiating partner, according to the Oslo Accords and the Declaration of Principles of 1993, is the PLO leadership. That means the team led by President Mahmoud Abbas and chief negotiator Ahmed Qurei. They too are facing a major moment of uncertainty, since Abbas&apos; term is scheduled to end on January 9. However, based on a constitutional law passed in the previous Palestinian Legislative Council formulated by my colleague at the Palestine-Israel Journal Ziad Abu Zayyad, future elections for president and the PLC are supposed to take place at the same time, which means January 2010, and negotiations are taking place now between Fatah and Hamas to arrive at an agreement on a compromise date. Palestinian unity is important for the negotiations, but the Palestinians must designate negotiating partners who are ready to negotiate. Today this means Fatah, the left and independents like the prime minister, Dr Salam Fayyad.  The Obama administration can help both the potential Israeli and Palestinian partners to the negotiations if they become engaged behind the scenes even before the inauguration on January 20, and will become publicly engaged immediately afterwards. There is a perception that time is running out on a realistic two-state solution, and a one-state solution is only a recipe for ongoing conflict, so constructive American action, with the aid of European and Arab partners, is of the utmost importance.

The eviction, which took place before dawn on Sunday, comes after years of litigation that culminated in an Israeli supreme court ruling in July ordering the couple out of the house.  Several governments, including the United States and Britain, whose consulate is a few hundred yards from the house in east Jerusalem, had tried to intervene on behalf of Mohammad and Fawzieh al-Kurd but without success. Most of the international community has not recognised Israeli sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which was captured in the 1967 war and annexed. Palestinians have long argued that evictions and demolitions are an attempt by Israel to reduce the number of Palestinians in east Jerusalem to allow settlement expansion and to pre-judge a final status peace agreement. &quot;It is damaging the peace between Palestinians and Israelis,&quot; said Rafiq Husseini, chief of staff to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. &quot;They have to halt their settlers or they will not have peace with us ever.&quot; Israeli officials argue they are following the law. A police spokesman said the eviction was in accordance with the court decision. The story of the al-Kurd house is long and disputed and involves complicated legal and political battles. Mohammad al-Kurd and his parents were one of several families of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war who were housed in the Sheikh Jarrah district in 1956, a time when it was under Jordanian control.  His family came from Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, and his wife&apos;s family was from Talbeyieh in west Jerusalem. Under an agreement with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees the families gave up their food ration cards and were given the properties under 33-year leases, which would revert to full ownership as long as they paid a token rent and kept the properties in good order. It appears, however, that the land was previously owned in the late 19th century by Jews - it is close to an old Jewish tomb long popular with pilgrims. In 1967, when Israel captured east Jerusalem, the property was taken by the custodian for absentee property, an Israeli institution that had also taken control of all property left behind by the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced out in the 1948 war. Two Jewish groups began a legal process to reclaim ownership of the property and in 1972 the court gave control of the land to the heirs of two rabbis who appeared to be the 19th century owners. The al-Kurd family say their Israeli lawyer made the agreement without their knowledge.  The couple became &apos;protected tenants&apos;, liable to pay rent to their new Israeli landlords but they refused on principle.  &quot;Why should I pay rent for my own house?&quot; said Fawzieh al-Kurd, 57, who sat yesterday by a tent on a patch of wasteland not far from her house. In 2001, several settlers began to occupy an outer part of the house and remain in place today \u2013 despite court orders to evict them. As soon as the couple was evicted at 4am on Sunday, a group of Jewish settlers moved in. They remain there today while armed police officers and private security guards patrol the surrounding area where several settler families live.  &quot;The Israeli government did what they wanted to do,&quot; said al-Kurd. &quot;Because we are Palestinians they have to humiliate and insult us like this? Don&apos;t we deserve to live in peace on our land?&quot; The United Nations relief and works agency (UNRWA) said it opposed the eviction of the al-Kurds and of all Palestinian refugees.  &quot;Throwing an elderly couple out of their house in the early hours of the morning is shameful,&quot; said Chris Gunness, a spokesman. &quot;UNRWA will continue to offer the family assistance but nothing we offer can compensate for the loss of a home.&quot; Although Israel&apos;s absentee property laws were applied on the al-Kurd family in favour of the original Jewish owners they are rarely, if ever, applied on properties in Israel that were owned by Palestinians before the 1948 war.  Rabbi Arik Ascherman, of the Israeli group Rabbis for Human Rights, acknowledged that the al-Kurd land may have belonged to Jews before 1948 but told the Associated Press: &quot;Do any of us Israelis really want to go back to the situation where everyone owns what they owned in 1948?&quot; Daniel Seidemann, a prominent Israeli human rights lawyer, said it appeared the al-Kurd family had no legal recourse left to hold on to their house. But he noted that their home is in an area much coveted by powerful Jewish settler groups.  &quot;This is part of the areas targeted by the settler organisations to surround the old city of Jerusalem,&quot; he said.  A scheme had been lodged which showed the settler groups hoped to eventually raze the houses they occupy and to build a much larger settlement complex.  &quot;There is a legal case that was decided on the al-Kurd family,&quot; he said. &quot;This does have political ramifications in that there is a concerted effort to take these targeted areas and reduce the Palestinian presence. Clearly, the al-Kurd family has been a victim.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-11-10T18:09:17Z", "title": "Palestinian couple evicted from home of half a century as Jerusalem settlers move in", "sentences": ["His family came from Jaffa, near Tel Aviv, and his wife&apos;s family was from Talbeyieh in west Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/10/israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "Israeli police have evicted a disabled Palestinian man and his wife from the home where they had lived for 52 years, in a Palestinian district of east Jerusalem which is now surrounded by hardline Jewish settlers.

About half of Gaza&apos;s 1.5 million residents were without power yesterday when their sole power plant shut down.  Israel, which is the sole provider of industrial fuel to the facility, had blocked shipments of EU-funded fuel for a week in response to a surge in rocket attacks. Palestinian militants said the attacks were in retaliation to an Israeli raid that killed six gunmen a week ago, despite a ceasefire that started in June. The Israeli army said it carried out its raid to foil the planned kidnapping of a soldier by Gaza militants. Israel&apos;s foreign ministry said it remained committed to the truce, but Hamas officials warned the Israeli move could further undermine the ceasefire. Palestinian workers said the first delivery of fuel had been received at the Nahal Oz fuel depot and was on its way to the power plant. Israeli officials said Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, agreed to a request from Tony Blair, the Middle East peace envoy, for a resumption of fuel shipments. Israel will allow minimal amounts of fuel to enter Gaza, starting today. Otherwise, the border crossings would remain closed, Israeli officials said. The decision to resume the deliveries came despite a rocket attack on Israel yesterday. The military said Palestinian militants fired three rockets at Israel, but two fell short and exploded inside Gaza.  The Israeli border closure has kept journalists from entering the coastal territory for five days, drawing a protest from the Tel Aviv-based foreign press association, which represents foreign reporters in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It called the Israeli move a serious violation of press freedom. An Israeli military spokesman said crossings would open only for humanitarian reasons and journalists would be allowed to leave but not enter. A Gaza energy official, Kanan Obeid, said the power plant was shut down after sundown. Much of Gaza city was without electricity after nightfall, although some residents started up their own generators. Israel&apos;s foreign ministry said 70% of Gaza&apos;s electricity came over lines directly from Israel and that had not been halted.  Gaza residents buy petrol and diesel fuel smuggled in from Egypt, which is used during blackouts to supply generators.

The last of my ancestors to take the King&apos;s Shilling had been my great-grandfather, who fought for the British empire during the first world war, and took part in the fierce battle of the Somme.  Despite surviving the carnage relatively unscathed, physically speaking, he bore the mental scars for the rest of his life, plagued forever more by memories of the horrors he encountered on the battlefield. He used to wake up screaming in the middle of the night, sweat pouring from his fevered brow as he drowned beneath a deluge of imaginary rats swarming through the trenches in his mind.  The closest I came to his torment during my time in uniform was simply dealing with the self-reproach and discomfort of policing the occupation in Palestinian cities; my spell of national service fortunately coinciding with a relative lull in the Israel-Palestine conflict. I demobbed six months before the second Lebanon war broke out, although many of my former comrades were unlucky enough to be caught up in the fighting, some of whom never made it back across the border to Israeli soil.  Not a day went by during the summer of 2006 when I didn&apos;t thank God that I hadn&apos;t had to be exposed to the true horrors of war; for all that we had taken part in some pretty unsavoury \u2013 and pretty violent \u2013 incidents during our own tour of duty, what we encountered paled in comparison to those who participated in battles to the death for days and weeks on end.  For all that I cannot begin to understand what they \u2013 or my great grandfather \u2013 went through on the front lines, similarly I defy anyone who has not served in a war zone such as the West Bank or Gaza to comprehend how these experiences take their toll on those who served in such conditions on a daily basis for years. Similarly, much as people strive to grasp what drives victims of oppression \u2013 be they Palestinian farmers, Vietnamese villagers, or any other downtrodden people \u2013 to such desperate measures in their acts of resistance, there can be no true understanding without having been in that situation for themselves.  It is easy to be an armchair supporter of either side in the Israel-Palestine imbroglio and take potshots from afar at those in the opposing camp, yet to do so without having walked a mile in the shoes of those with whom one disagrees is utterly unhelpful in the bigger picture. While I detest the lengths to which the Israeli government and army go in order to suppress the Palestinians in the apparent pursuit of security, I cannot ignore the fear factor which propels the Israeli electorate to give their leaders carte blanche to carry out such abuses.  A collective memory stretching back generations, encompassing the Holocaust, eastern European pogroms, and events all the way back to Temple times, has taken a heavy toll on many Jews, allowing rhyme and reason to be replaced with rampant nationalism and state racism when it comes to modern-day Israel. While the fear in no way excuses the abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians, it has to be first identified and isolated before the malignant disease coursing through Israel&apos;s psyche can be dealt with at all.  To some extent, it appears that Israeli society is already embarking on a process of introspection and self-evaluation, if films such as Waltz With Bashir and Beaufort are anything to go by. I saw Waltz With Bashir in a packed Tel Aviv cinema, and the silence as the credits rolled was deafening, given the Israeli tendency to talk nineteen-to-the-dozen at any opportunity. Instead, the audience sat in contemplative, stunned quiet, the trauma of the film&apos;s central characters having seeped from the silver screen into the hearts and minds of all who had witnessed the story play itself out.  I have no doubt that, were the same audience to be exposed to a Palestinian version of a psychological war film such as Waltz With Bashir, they would begin to view the experience of Palestinian fighters and militants through far more understanding, if not wholly sympathetic, eyes. As an ex-soldier myself, who was schooled on a diet of anti-Palestinian propaganda throughout my army service, it wasn&apos;t until I began to talk to Palestinians for myself that I began any kind of process of judging their situation in an honest and balanced fashion.  For all the poppies worn brazenly on lapels the length and breadth of England this week, the most fitting tribute to those who fell in defence of our freedom is to use our liberty to push beyond our comfort zones, and look at what catalysts are fuelling those who we are quick to castigate as evil and irredeemable. War takes an immeasurable toll on all who are touched by it \u2013 be they my great-grandfather, the mother of a fallen soldier in Lebanon, or the child of a militant shot dead by the IDF \u2013 and dismissing their reactions out of hand leaves us as far back on the path to peace now as we were 90 years ago.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-11T19:06:00Z", "title": "Seth Freedman: The biggest tribute we can pay to those who fell in defence of our freedom is to try and understand both sides of every conflict", "sentences": ["I saw Waltz With Bashir in a packed Tel Aviv cinema, and the silence as the credits rolled was deafening, given the Israeli tendency to talk nineteen-to-the-dozen at any opportunity."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/11/firstworldwar-israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Tony Blair", "World news", "Israel", "Politics"], "article": "One of Tony Blair&apos;s guards accidentally fired his gun at Ben Gurion airport, Tel Aviv, as Blair was boarding a plane to leave Israel, police said yesterday.

This conversation is happening, mid shoulder-stand, at a Tel Aviv yoga class on the morning of the nationwide municipal elections. The man they&apos;re discussing is the mayoral candidate Dov Hanin whose party, City for All, has blown a refreshing wind of change through the corrupt cobwebs of municipal politics. Hanin is one of those &quot;radical leftwing&quot; types; a player in national politics (he pushed the Knesset&apos;s &quot;green&quot; laws, amongst other things), a communist and a peacenik. Not classic mayoral material, then, but he and his party are campaigning as the voice of all Tel Aviv citizens who have suffered a creeping sense of disempowerment over the past few years.  Tel Aviv has boomed (in the good sense of the word) over the last half decade or so, but at a cost to its residents who suffer in all the usual ways brought on by a sort of nouveau riche gentrification: rising bills, exorbitant properties, traffic chaos and a sneery local council approach to public transport. I use the &quot;new rich&quot; tag in a sort of Thatcherite loadsamoney context, minus the class associations: Tel Aviv&apos;s money might unexpectedly impress tourists, but it&apos;s perceived as brassy and superficial by many of its residents who are being sidelined into the suburbs in exchange for a few flashy new bars.  In any case City for All is clearly not opposed to wealth, but argues that a city boom should not by definition batter local residents: why build luxury penthouses when the capital is desperately short of smaller, affordable housing? Why invest in extra highway lanes that create more traffic instead of pumping up public transport so that people don&apos;t need to bring cars into the city? Familiar arguments, in short, but it represents a kind of paradigm shift in local Tel Aviv politics, which for years have carried a subtext of uninterest in ordinary residents, those same residents, in fact, that give the city its marketable character.  As a result of all this new, City for All thinking, there&apos;s a distinct air of hope and enthusiasm abuzz in Tel Aviv. Those &quot;I Dov Tel Aviv&quot; heart-logo T-shirts that some residents are wearing seem to be as much an expression of renewed civic pride as they are slogans of support for Hanin. But it runs deeper than frothy optimism and speaks of a political inclusion that hasn&apos;t really been a feature of this capital in recent years.  Six months ago, my eyes glazed over as a friend told me about a new party, based on participatory politics, that was going to stand in the city&apos;s local elections. A few days ago, I went to a Dov do and saw what that means in practice: scores of people taking about change being possible and internalising the concept that participation does not solely consist of handing out campaign leaflets.  Israel has low turnouts for local elections (although not as low as in the UK) but many first-time voters in Tel Aviv say they were inspired to use the ballot box this time around. Hope is a depressingly rare commodity in Israeli politics, and politics is not really in the vocabulary of its ambivalent capital city-dwellers.

A kettle is boiling in the background and the windows are beginning to steam up as Ryan Babel takes his seat and offers a polite handshake. First impressions? That he seems remarkably unassuming for a star footballer at one of Europe&apos;s bigger clubs. But then there is the story of him berating a team-mate - &quot;where&apos;s your touch?&quot; - in one of his first training sessions at Liverpool so maybe there is more to him than meets the eye. He is an intriguing character. Babel is 22 next month, but you could easily think he was younger. He has a boyish, slightly buck-toothed smile and you want to put an arm round him when he explains how, before moving to Liverpool, he had never lived away from his parents and how, 16 months in, he is still trying to find a church where he feels totally comfortable. Babel often carries a copy of the Bible and has a routine before every match where he finds a quiet spot for his prayers.  But Babel is streetwise. He had to be to survive in the Bijlmermeer, the unloved district of Amsterdam where he was brought up. Just click online and watch the videos of him rapping. Babel has a studio at home and has put out a number of records under the name Rio, including one collaboration with his Holland international team-mate Royston Drenthe. His lyrics could make Eminem blush - sample: &quot;you can see this nigga with number 19/I can&apos;t even spend all my money/keep your daughter inside or you will be my family&quot; - but the Dutch seem to like it. &quot;The last one was called Eeyeeyo and went to number one in Holland over the summer,&quot; he says. &quot;Music has always been an important part of my life.&quot;  The Biljmermeer, or colloquially Bijlmer, is a cluster of tower blocks close to the Amsterdam Arena and home to many of the city&apos;s 70,000 immigrants from the former Dutch colony of Surinam. &quot;I don&apos;t want to use the word &apos;ghetto&apos; but that is one way people describe it,&quot; says Babel. &quot;I was lucky. My parents were very strict and had rules for me and, if ever I was playing outside, I always had a set time to come back in. But the Bijlmer had a lot of problems and I had other friends who chose the wrong road. There were a lot of drugs and crime and when you get into that scene it can be difficult to get back out.&quot;  This was also the place where El Al flight 1862, on the way from New York to Tel Aviv and having refuelled at Schiphol airport, crashed in 1992. &quot;The plane came over our flat [he uses his hand to show how close it was] before crashing into the next high block. It could easily have been us.&quot; Thirty-nine people from his neighbourhood were killed, along with the three crew members on the plane and the only other person on board, a non-paying passenger. &quot;It&apos;s a horrible memory. I was very young at the time [two months short of his sixth birthday] but I can still remember it. There was this almighty bang and when we ran out we could see all the flames and smoke. We were so close to it we had to leave our flat because it was not safe and we ended up at my grandma&apos;s. Then, when we were allowed to go back, I can just remember this terrible scene of complete devastation. It was like something out of a film.&quot; His upbringing makes him more interested in real life than celebrity life. Babel is not just an accomplished footballer for Liverpool but a fine ambassador. He has been involved in an anti-racism workshop run by the Anthony Walker Foundation and this week devoted himself to another of the Premier League&apos;s Creating Chances events, at the launch of Liverpool&apos;s Respect 4 All centre. The project, funded in part by the Premier League Professional Footballers&apos; Association, is for 12- to 16-year-olds with different types of disabilities.  Babel moved easily among the children, starting off with a game of wheelchair basketball before a target-practice routine with visually impaired children and a penalty shoot-out with youngsters with severe learning difficulties. Two hours of what would ordinarily be post-training rest time had elapsed by the time he had finished, but he was happy. &quot;It&apos;s always a good feeling if you can make these kids happy. Not everyone has the life they expect but I still think they can make the best of it and, with this kind of centre, we want to help to inspire them.&quot; Babel has sporting genes. His father, Guno, is a basketball coach. His mother, Asta, was an accomplished athlete and his sister, Janice, almost made it to the Olympics as a 100m and 200m sprinter. As fast as her brother? &quot;Close,&quot; he smiles.  His own athleticism was first spotted by Ajax when he was 11, although it was not a straightforward process. &quot;They used to have selection days for all the local kids and I went to these trials three times and got turned down every time,&quot; he recalls. &quot;On the third time I was so upset because I thought I was not good enough. I was eight years old and I had the feeling, &apos;That&apos;s it, I don&apos;t want to play for Ajax any more!&apos; But I kept doing well at my amateur club and, in the end, Ajax came to me.&quot; No community on the planet, per capita, produces more top footballers than Surinam. In their day, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids and Patrick Kluivert - all of Surinamese heritage - could all fit in a world XI. Babel is seen as the latest in a long distinguished line. He made his debut for Ajax shortly after his 17th birthday and, at 18, became Holland&apos;s youngest international goalscorer since the 1930s. He cost Liverpool \u00a311.5m and, in his first season, won their young player of the season award. Yet there are glimpses of frustration. Babel made 20 of his 48 appearances last season from the bench and, since the start of this one, has found himself on the edges even more. Of his 14 appearances, 10 have been as a substitute, making it difficult for him to fulfil the great Marco van Basten&apos;s prophecy that he could be &quot;the next Thierry Henry&quot;.  &quot;I&apos;m satisfied with my level of performance but the situation is clear - that I&apos;m not going to be one of the regular 11 starters,&quot; says Babel. &quot;It&apos;s difficult. I do get frustrated. I can tell myself that I&apos;m still only 21 and at the start of my career. But it is making it hard for me because, as time goes on, they keep telling me that I&apos;m young and that my time will come. Well, OK, but I&apos;m not a player who wants to wait. I want to be involved now rather than in three or four years&apos; time.&quot; While Rafael Ben\u00edtez has used Robbie Keane to partner Fernando Torres, Babel has mostly been employed on the wing. His pace could trouble any full-back, but Babel is a reluctant wide man. &quot;I have always said that I want to play as a striker,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course, it would not help me improve if I wasn&apos;t able to play, or train, in another position a couple of times. But all the time? I used to play as a striker in Holland. I grew up as a striker. That&apos;s the position I want to play. &quot;But I&apos;m working on it. I look at myself before I blame others.

The audience talking in Hebrew before the lights went down indicated that I was in a minority of those requiring subtitles. The film&apos;s subject was the disastrous first week of the northern campaign of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, the soldiers sliding in the mud, assailed from the skies by Syrian bombers. This was, Israeli friends assured me, almost certainly an allegory of the quagmire in Lebanon at the time, although Israeli cinema was almost unknown outside its own country. Israel on screen was an aspect of the news. It lacked a niche even in the art house. Until recently, Israeli film was insular, hemmed in by the restrictions of a tiny market for the Hebrew language, the Arab boycott in the Middle East, and a domestic audience that preferred dubbed movies from America. Last year, however, Israeli cinema experienced an annus mirabilis. Four films - Jellyfish, The Band&apos;s Visit, Beaufort, and My Father, My Lord - swept the international film festival awards. This was all the more remarkable because two of the four had nothing to do with Middle East politics. The films coming out of Israel in the past two or three years have reflected both the complex fissures in Israeli society and a sense of internal pessimism and unease after the collapse of the Oslo Accords, the start of the second intifada, and the 2006 Lebanon war. It was not that Israel had lacked political film-makers; it had lacked the audiences in Israel and abroad who wanted to see their work. Since the end of Oslo, there has been a sense, as Israeli novelist David Grossman says, of Israel retreating from its hope for itself as a &quot;normal&quot; country, propelled back into being what he calls &quot;a big story&quot;. It is this new mood that Israeli cinema is reflecting.  The biggest story in recent Israeli history is the 1982 massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon, an atrocity carried out by Christian Phalangists while the Israeli command turned a blind eye. Lebanon is part of the Israeli psyche, its shadow, its other place. More Israelis in uniform have set foot on Lebanese soil than on Gaza and the West Bank. The killings in Sabra and Shatila, which brought 400,000 protestors on to the streets of Tel Aviv and led to the founding of Peace Now, has been the seeping wound.  It is also the driving force of Ari Folman&apos;s Waltz With Bashir, an animated part-documentary about the responsibility carried by the young Israeli soldiers who were on duty nearby. The film, released later this week, begins with a pack of ferocious dogs hurtling down a Tel Aviv street, about to tear the flesh of a sleeping middle-aged Israeli man who wakes from this recurring nightmare and later recounts it to a friend, the film&apos;s director. Out of the dream comes a quest to uncover why Folman is unable to remember anything about his own past: the time he spent doing his military service during the Lebanon war, a mile or so away from the Sabra and Shatila killing fields. Waltz With Bashir is not about the massacre; only in its final frames do we see contemporary news footage. It is not told from the point of view of the survivors, or the relatives of the dead, but that of the teenage soldiers. The film&apos;s subject is memory and responsibility, using animation to recreate the hallucinogenic qualities of recollection, which itself is reinvention: the past is not a filing cabinet or a video camera.  On its release, the film swept the Israeli Ophirs, the country&apos;s Oscars, and led to an intense re-engagement with more recent pasts, particularly among a younger generation of soldiers who served in the IDF in the second intifada. The year before, Beaufort (nominated for best foreign language Oscar) had told the story of a retreat: the closing months before Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000. Three hundred thousand Israelis bought tickets to see the film because of its profound resonances with the catastrophe of the 2006 Lebanon war.  Part of Israeli cinema&apos;s high international profile is due undoubtedly to the fact that, in the past decade, nothing seems to be off-limits to its directors. Eytan Fox&apos;s Walk On Water (2004) depicts a relationship between a gay Israeli and a gay Palestinian, while his earlier film, Yossi and Jagger (2002), deals with a love affair between two serving male soldiers in Lebanon. Eran Riklis&apos;s new film, Lemon Tree, is based on a true story about a Palestinian widow who took her neighbour, the minister of defence, to court to appeal his decision to cut down her adjacent lemon grove, the sole source of her income. As a lawyer in the film remarks, life isn&apos;t like a Hollywood movie, and there is no happy ending: the final shots show the minister standing in the shadow of the monstrous concrete wall that blocks the sight of the devastated lemon trees on the other side. Political cinema is not the whole story. Jellyfish, a surreal comedy about a generation of drifting youth in Tel Aviv, directed by short-story writer Etgar Keret and written by his wife, Shira Geffen, won the Camera d&apos;Or at Cannes last year. (Keret&apos;s books are said to be the most shoplifted from the country&apos;s bookstore chain, Steimatzky.) And arguably the most successful Israeli film, before Waltz With Bashir, was Eran Kolirin&apos;s The Band&apos;s Visit (2007) - a surprise hit outside Israel, and a multiple award-winner. The story of an Egyptian police band, booked to appear at a Palestinian-Israeli cultural centre who wind up in the wrong place, but exposed the lives of Israel&apos;s desert development towns, the dumping ground for working-class Jewish immigrants from North Africa. Shot as if it were a series of Martin Parr photographs and only fitfully animated, it focused on the lives of the forgotten on both sides of the Egyptian and Israeli border. But it also struck a universal chord about the disappointments of middle age, the failures of marriage and the terrors of adolescence, showing that small-town life is small-town life, whether in the Middle East or the Midlands.  Keret told me the recent upsurge in Israeli cinema is attributable to three factors: a change of direction in the Israeli Film Fund; the decline of Israeli television as a place for artistic experimentation; and the growth of co-production deals with Europe. (In July, Margaret Hodge announced that Britain would be adding Israel to its list of six countries with which it has co-production treaties.) Keret cites Katriel Schory, a documentary producer who took over the film fund in 1999, as having single-handedly revived the industry by being prepared to take risks. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to see that a film like Waltz With Bashir could have been made 10 years ago,&quot; he says, not because of its content but because of its use of animation.  Like Britain and America, Israeli TV has all but banished innovation; a diet of reality and sketch shows has driven out creativity. TV is what you turn on to anaesthetise yourself from failed wars and failing governments. &quot;Since the second intifada, Israeli society has become more reactionary and conservative,&quot; Keret says. &quot;Commercial TV is the first place to reflect that, so people work more and more on screenplays, where you can be independent.&quot; The impact of Schory&apos;s leadership of the film fund has been to show unknown aspects of Israel to the outside world, and to open a window into an unfamiliar domestic reality at home. Lemon Tree, with its theme of the current occupation, was less popular in Israel, Keret says, because the occupation is the subject of 24-hour news.  Watching Waltz With Bashir in a London screening room on a Monday morning, the audience still rooted to their seats after the credits had stopped rolling, it was as if a graphic novel had been brought to life. Yet it was more real for the absence of journalistic balance, or the outrage of the political activist and the engaged intellectual. Waltz With Bashir is Israel&apos;s cinematic coming of age, not because Israeli film-makers have suddenly discovered their conscience, but because they have the creative vision to tell, at last, the tragedy and comedy of being a &quot;big story&quot; \u00b7 \u2022 Waltz With Bashir is released on Friday, and Lemon Tree on December 12. \u00b7 The following clarification was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday November 24 2008.

Last year OFM reported that allergy researchers at Guy&apos;s Hospital had suspicions that the advice to parents of small children may be causing allergies rather than preventing them, and according to this article (pdf) in October&apos;s Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology there is now evidence that children who eat few or no peanuts when they are babies are 10 times as likely to develop peanut allergy later in life. Now, where food meets illness you can usually find academic research to prove any thesis you like - as the food / health industry knows so well. But this report, from scientists in Tel Aviv and London, looks pretty convincing. Peanuts are a much-used weaning food in Israel. Between 8 and 14 months old the average Israeli baby eats 7.1 grams of peanut monthly. The average British baby eats almost no peanuts at all - after all, for some years official government advice has warned parents of young children away from them. The researchers questioned more than 5000 school-age children in each country, and found that the rate of peanut allergy (PA) was 10 times as high in Britain. They conclude:   These findings raise the question of whether earlyintroduction of peanut during infancy, rather than avoidance, will prevent the development of PA  Of course, the default position of many food lovers is that food intolerance is chiefly in the mind anyway. My mother stoutly maintains that no-one in the early 1970s had allergies because no-one had thought of them yet. But I once ate a curry with my PA-prone friend Sophy in a pub in Castle Cary - and shortly afterwards watched her start to swell and then choke (I nearly fainted - the staff got her to hospital). Now I tend to take these things more seriously. But obviously, excessive worrying can cause or exacerbate illnesses. There&apos;s been a sharp rise in the incidence of measles in Britain chiefly because of parents put off the MMR vaccine by fantastical bad publicity in certain mid-market tabloids. We&apos;re a nation obsessed with food allergy - the TV nutritionist Patrick Holford claims that 50% of us suffer from it in one form or another. More sober (but not quite so business-friendly) science suggests that our obsessive cleanliness around the house is destroying too much bacteria, and thus stopping children from developing their immune systems. I know a doctor who insists that children should be allowed to pick their noses - and eat it. Gross, but it makes sense. There&apos;s lots of evidence that you can develop tolerances to things you ingest early. Children who have worn nickel-based braces on their teeth are less likely to have an allergic reaction to cheap earrings when they get their ears pierced. It&apos;s thought too that children who encounter wheat before they are six months old are less likely to develop the common gluten allergies later.  Did Sophy&apos;s mum stop her eating peanuts when she was a kid? No. But is there any other feasible explanation for the rise in food allergies? 1.8% of British children are now prone to PA, and the rate for that and other allergies is going up relentlessly.  So, if there&apos;s a chance that you could inoculate a child by exposing them early to foods that might cause problems, might this be a model for foodie parents who want to produce their dream child - the kid who&apos;ll eat anything? It would have a pleasing logic. Does this seem to ring true in your experience? Is there a WoM infant out there we could experiment on?

There was this little toxic stream flowing past a steel plant into the Yangtze. It was literally popping with chemicals - it actually looked like it was raining. And right next to it was this picnic area. For most of the people of Chongqing, it is a picturesque place to go and visit; some were even swimming and fishing.

Had I asked permission, they would have turned towards me and it would all have been different. I did check with them afterwards, to make sure it was OK. I was already excited. I knew the image would work.

Tzipi Livni, foreign minister and head of the ruling Kadima party, said Olmert should quit immediately. If he did declare himself incapacitated and leave office, Livni would automatically replace him as acting prime minister which her aides believe would give her a better chance in the coming general elections in February.  Although Olmert announced his resignation in late July and did not take part in the leadership contest to head Kadima, he has so far insisted he should remain in his job until a government is formed after the elections. He and Livni are known to be rivals but they now appear to be increasingly at odds with each other.  &quot;The prime minister must take leave. There is no other option,&quot; Livni told Kadima party members at an emergency meeting yesterday in Petach Tikva, near Tel Aviv. &quot;The Kadima Party cannot afford to follow these norms. There has been a change in Israel. This isn&apos;t Olmert&apos;s personal matter but a public matter.&quot;  Livni failed to form a coalition government after winning the leadership of Kadima in September. Olmert then decided to stay in his post as prime minister until the elections, despite private pressure from Livni and her allies to step down.  Livni is still back in second position in opinion polls behind opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, of the Likud party. Her supporters say that by failing to take a strong stance against the corruption investigations that have surrounded Olmert for months, the party is being damaged in the eyes of the public. It is not the first time Olmert and Livni have fallen out. Last year she called for his resignation after a government appointed commission severely criticised his handling of the 2006 war in Lebanon. Olmert has faced several corruption investigations and has been repeatedly interviewed by police over several months. On Wednesday the justice ministry released a statement saying that Olmert had been told that Meni Mazuz, the attorney general, was &quot;considering bringing criminal charges against him&quot; on suspicion of corruption in the so-called Rishon Tours affair. Olmert is accused of double-billing several different groups for trips he made abroad while he was mayor of Jerusalem and later industry minister. Reports yesterday said around $85,000 had been accumulated in an account at the travel agency Rishon Tours which Olmert then spent on private family trips abroad and upgrades. The groups he is alleged to have defrauded include the Simon Weisenthal Center, the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and the World Jewish Congress, according to the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper.

What is less well known about the area is its zimmers; a cross between a boutique B&amp;B and a home stay, run by Israeli families. In 20 years of visiting Israel I had never stayed in a zimmer, and chose to begin my stay this time in Had Nes - a community set up in 1998 for displaced Israelis, after parts of the Sinai were returned to Egypt. Hosts Ronit and Giliy Frenkel welcome me and my two friends like long-lost members of the family, showing us to a room that is actually a cave; a mesh of romance and kitsch. Outside is a hammock, table and chair - and a breathtaking view of the mountains and Sea of Galillee. Staying at Had Nes feels very much like staying with the Frenkels, who moved to the area when they decided Tel Aviv was not where they wanted to raise their kids. &apos;The reason so many special, spiritual people have lived and died here is because God is here,&apos; says Giliy. Waking up the following morning and absorbing the sunlit sea and mountains and the crystal-clear air, it does feel as though Giliy may have a point. After a delicious breakfast of omelette, cheeses, breads, yoghurt and fresh juice delivered to our room, we drive a few miles to Meshushim, a natural pool surrounded by unique hexagonal rock formations and part of the Yehudiya Forest Nature Reserve. After a short, easy walk we arrive at the water and dive in for a swim and then bask in the sunshine. The drive back down into the mountains, as with every drive we do, is dominated by the stunning landscape and in particular the Sea of Galillee (or Kinneret, as it is known in Hebrew, which means harp). It can be seen from almost everywhere and the brilliance of its blueness makes it hard to stop staring at it. We stop off on the shore for a stroll round the ruins of Capernaum - named in the gospel of St Luke as Jesus&apos;s synagogue - then pop into the city of Tiberius for an ice cream, before heading to Zippori in the Jezreel Valley, our base for the next two nights. Like the Frenkels, our hosts Suzy and Mitch Pilcer chose to leave a city that had become too hectic, although for them it was Jersualem. Zippori, their new home, is a moshav - or working agricultural village. Although not a collective establishment like a kibbutz, its residents still participate in a community-based form of democracy and that night, a motion to build chicken coops in the hills is defeated in the meeting hall. The more we chat, the more noticeable it becomes that the Pilcers, like the Frenkels, don&apos;t mention the political situation - suprising to outsiders who assume that it pervades every aspect of Israeli existence. It does eventually arise, when Mitch mentions that he is an army spokesman, but only because I ask him what he does. The next day, we visit Zippori&apos;s ruins from the Roman, Byzantine and Crusader periods. Zippori has an important religious history; at the start of the 3rd century it was home to the Sanhedrin, the highest institution of Jewish law. Spectacular mosaics on the floor of the synagogue, depicting Bible stories and Jewish motifs, have recently been discovered. We spend the afternoon canoeing down the Jordan River, before returning to what now feels like home, for a barbecue. On our last day we drive to Belvoir, the Crusader castle built by the Hospitaller Knights in 1168 and captured by an Arab general, Saladin, in 1189 following an 18-month-long siege. As suggested by its name, the view from the top of the ruins is quite something - the array of colours almost too much to absorb. It is also seriously hot, so we spend the afternoon cooling down at Sakhne natural pools, eschewing the option of a more strenuous hike.  Surrounded by such tranquility, I feel that I have discovered a different side of Israel on this trip; you never really get to grips with a country until you get to grips with its people, and staying in a zimmer offers the perfect opportunity to do just that.

It was pretty hairy in those days, when graffiti artists would go out and paint trains. Then, it was all about getting your train seen from one side of the city to the other,&apos; recalls Goldie, one of the contenders for the first Street Art awards on Thursday. Street art has come a long way from the days when it enraged commuters. Now, with the likes of Banksy and Adam Neate - who earlier this month did a free art drop in London, leaving 1,000 pieces of art worth \u00a31 million in total on the streets - and Bonhams auction house, which holds dedicated urban-art sales, street art means big business.  Which is partly why Mark Bracegirdle, whose Auction Saboteur website allows buyers and sellers of urban art to trade without auction-house fees, has decided to celebrate the art form. Alongside the awards, he&apos;s raising money for the charity Single Homeless Project by auctioning off custom pieces of work on record covers or vinyls which have been donated by more than 60 artists, many of whom have also been nominated.  The awards themselves will be split into two categories, street and urban art (street art is on the street, urban art is for inside) which the public can vote for online. On the night, winners will be whittled down from a shortlist with the final deciding votes cast by those attending the awards.  Graffiti has also gone international. &apos;There&apos;s everything from cut-and-paste to fine art,&apos; says Spencer Hickman, manager of the Rough Trade East record shop in London, where the awards will be held. &apos;The German duo Hera and Akut, who paint together as Herakut, do huge photo-like graffiti pieces and there&apos;s a two-year waiting list for their work.

She&apos;s been nominated in the urban art category for her picture of Jesus on an aerosol can.  For Bracegirdle, though, accessibility is the best thing about the art form. &apos;Anyone can be a street artist, anyone can be the audience and anyone can be the critic, from a taxi driver to a schoolboy, everyone has an opinion on what they think is good and that&apos;s a relatively new thing.&apos; \u2022 For information about the Street Art Awards, see streetartawards.com", "publicationDate": "2008-11-30T00:01:00Z", "title": "Emma Hope on a new award that celebrates street art", "sentences": ["Another prolific artist is Know Hope from Tel Aviv, who creates intricate 3D cardboard lanterns which he leaves on the streets for people to appreciate on their way to work.&apos; Then there&apos;s Baroness Carrie von Reichardt, perhaps best known for &apos;The Treatment Rooms&apos;, where she covered the exterior of a house in mosaic art."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/30/street-art-awards-graffiti-urban"}, {"tags": ["Mumbai terror attacks", "India", "Kashmir", "Pakistan", "World news"], "article": "Three weeks ago, in the Kashmiri capital of Srinagar, I met a young surgeon named Dr Iqbal Saleem. Iqbal described to me how on 11 August this year, Indian security forces entered the hospital where he was fighting to save the lives of unarmed civilian protesters who had been shot earlier that day by the Indian army. The operating theatre had been tear-gassed and the wards riddled with bullets, creating panic and injuring several of the nurses. Iqbal had trained at the Apollo hospital in Delhi and said he harboured no hatred against Hindus or Indians. But the incident had profoundly disgusted him and the unrepentant actions of the security forces, combined with the indifference of the Indian media, had convinced him that Kashmir needed its independence.  I thought back to this conversation last week, when news came in that the murderous attackers of Mumbai had brutally assaulted the city&apos;s hospitals in addition to the more obvious Islamist targets of five-star hotels, Jewish centres and cafes frequented by Americans and Brits. Since then, the links between the Mumbai attacks and the separatist struggle in Kashmir have become ever more explicit. There now seems to be a growing consensus that the operation is linked to the Pakistan-based jihadi outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba, whose leader, Hafiz Muhammad Sayeed, operates openly from his base at Muridhke outside Lahore.  This probable Pakistani origin of the Mumbai attacks, and the links to Kashmir-focused jihadi groups, means that the horrific events have to be seen in the context of the wider disaster of Western policy in the region since 9/11. The abject failure of the Bush administration to woo the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan away from the Islamists and, instead, managing to convince many of them of the hostility of the West towards all Muslim aspirations, has now led to a gathering catastrophe in Afghanistan where the once-hated Taliban are now again at the gates of Kabul. Meanwhile, the blowback from that Afghan conflict in Pakistan has meant that Asif Ali Zardari&apos;s government has now lost control of much of the North West Frontier Province, in addition to the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas, while religious and political extremism flourishes as never before. Pakistan&apos;s most intractable problem remains the relationship of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) over the last 25 years with myriad jihadi groups. Once, the ISI believed that they could use jihadis for their own ends, but the Islamists have increasingly followed their own agendas, to the extent that they now feel capable of launching well-equipped and well-trained armies into Indian territory, as happened so dramatically in Mumbai.  Visiting Pakistan last week, it was clear that much of the north of the country was slipping out of government control. While it is unlikely that Zardari&apos;s government had any direct link to the Mumbai attacks, there is every reason to believe that its failure effectively to crack down on the country&apos;s jihadi network, and its equivocation with figures such as Hafiz Muhammad Syed, means that atrocities of the kind we saw last week are likely to continue. India meanwhile continues to make matters worse by its ill-treatment of the people of Kashmir, which has handed to the jihadis an entire generation of educated, angry middle-class Muslims. One of the clean-shaven boys who attacked CST railway station - now named by the Indian media as Mohammad Ajmal Mohammad Amin Kasab, from Faridkot in the Pakistani Punjab - was wearing a Versace T-shirt. The other boys in the operation wore jeans and Nikes and were described by eyewitnesses as chikna or well-off. These were not poor, madrasah-educated Pakistanis from the villages, brainwashed by mullahs, but angry and well-educated, middle-class kids furious at the gross injustice they perceive being done to Muslims by Israel, the US, the UK and India in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Kashmir respectively.  If Israel&apos;s treatment of the Palestinians is the most emotive issue for Muslims in the Middle East, then India&apos;s treatment of the people of Kashmir plays a similar role among South-Asian Muslims. At the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the state should logically have gone to Pakistan. However, the pro-Indian sympathies of the state&apos;s Hindu Maharajah, as well as the Kashmiri origins of the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, led to the state passing instead to India - on the condition that the Kashmiris retained a degree of autonomy. Successive Indian governments, however, refused to honour their constitutional commitments to the state. The referendum, promised by Nehru at the UN, on whether the state would remain part of India, was never held. Following the shameless rigging of the 1987 local elections, Kashmiri leaders went underground. Soon after, bombings and assassination began, assisted by Pakistan&apos;s ISI which ramped up the conflict by sending over the border thousands of heavily armed jihadis.  India, meanwhile, responded with great brutality to the insurgency. Half-a-million Indian soldiers and paramilitaries were dispatched to garrison the valley. There were mass arrests and much violence against ordinary civilians, little of which was ever investigated, either by the government or the Indian media. Two torture centres were set up - Papa 1 and Papa 2 - into which large numbers of local people would &apos;disappear&apos;. In all, some 70,000 people have now lost their lives in the conflict. India and Pakistan have fought three inconclusive wars over Kashmir, while a fourth mini-war came alarmingly close to igniting a nuclear exchange between the two countries in 1999. Now, after the Mumbai attacks, Kashmir looks likely to derail yet again the burgeoning peace process between India and Pakistan.  Kashmir continues to divide the establishment of Pakistan more than any other issue. Zardari might publicly announce that he doesn&apos;t want to let Kashmir get in the way of improved relations between India and Pakistan, but Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is officially banned, continues to function under the name of Jama&apos;at al-Dawa, and Hafiz Muhammad Sayeed continues openly to incite strikes against Indian and Western targets. At one recent meeting, he proclaimed that &apos;Christians, Jews and Hindus are enemies of Islam&apos; and added that it was the aim of the Lashkar to &apos;unfurl the green flag of Islam in Washington, Tel Aviv and New Delhi&apos;.  Sayeed also proclaims that the former princely state of what he calls &apos;Hyderabad Deccan&apos; is also a part of Pakistan, which may explain the claim of responsibility for the attacks by a previously unknown group named the Deccan Mujahideen. It is clear Sayeed appears to operate with a measure of patronage from the Pakistani establishment and the Zardari government recently cleared the purchase of a bulletproof Land Cruiser for him. When Pakistan&apos;s Foreign Minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, was yesterday asked on Indian TV whether Pakistan would now arrest Sayeed, he dodged the question answering: &apos;We have to recognise that there are elements in every society that can act on their own.&apos;  In the months ahead, we are likely to see a security crackdown in India and huge pressure applied to Pakistan to match its pro-Indian and pro-Western rhetoric with real action against the country&apos;s jihadi groups. But there is unlikely to be peace in South Asia until the demands of the Kashmiris are in some measure addressed and the swamp of grievance in Srinagar somehow drained. Until then, the Mumbai massacres may be a harbinger of more violence to come. \u2022 William Dalrymple&apos;s Last Mughal won the Duff Cooper Prize and the Crossword Indian Book of the Year prize.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-30T00:01:00Z", "title": "William Dalrymple: Mumbai atrocities highlight need for solution in Kashmir", "sentences": ["At one recent meeting, he proclaimed that &apos;Christians, Jews and Hindus are enemies of Islam&apos; and added that it was the aim of the Lashkar to &apos;unfurl the green flag of Islam in Washington, Tel Aviv and New Delhi&apos;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/30/mumbai-terror-attacks-india1"}, {"tags": ["Life and style"], "article": "Bedouin villages in the area, is &apos;unrecognised&apos; by an Israeli government that refuses to accept the land claims of the Negev Desert&apos;s indigenous people. By the time I get to what remains of AA&apos;s house, its destruction is old news, both in the village of Al-Zarnouk, where the single-storey building had stood for more than 20 years, and far beyond: thanks to mobile telephones and the internet, hundreds of people have already seen images of its demolition by the Israeli Defense Forces on the morning of 30 October. But, five days on, the air is still heavy with cement dust and quiet despair. AA, who is 28 and has three children under the age of five, wears the bewildering smile of one so traumatised that she is more inclined to uncontrolled laughter than tears. She stares at the chalky pile of rubble that is her former home - spears of metal protrude from the cheap concrete like giant thorns - and wonders yet again if the gold that she received on her marriage lies somewhere beneath it. It would be good to find those necklaces and bangles because her life savings, a wad of shekels worth about \u00a31,200, were nowhere to be found when her neighbours managed to drag the chest of drawers in which she kept it outside in the moments before the JCBs began their terrible work. Had the soldiers inside already been through it and taken what they wanted? This is her belief, though she has no proof of it, of course. AA is a teacher. She was at school when the army arrived. They came at 9am - 50 soldiers, plus a handful of contractors, a group of Jewish settlers - and by 9.45am their task was complete. Though her neighbours tried to stop them, the soldiers were impassive, their faces &apos;like walls&apos;. Ostensibly the reason they chose AA&apos;s house as opposed to any other in Al-Zarnouk was because she had recently renovated it, exchanging its asbestos roof for one made of corrugated iron; an inspector had ruled these changes &apos;illegal&apos;.  But the truth is that her improvements had little to do with it. Al-Zarnouk, like 44 other Bedouin villages in the area, is &apos;unrecognised&apos; by an Israeli government that refuses to accept the land claims of the Negev Desert&apos;s indigenous people. The Negev, says the government, is not the ancestral land of the Bedouin; it belongs to the Israeli state, and whether their roofs are made of iron or asbestos the Bedouin are merely squatters. The government would like AA and her neighbours to move into one of the seven townships it does recognise, towns built specially for them - and for as long as they refuse to do so, they will pay the price: no electricity, no water, the constant threat of demolition. If a place does not exist - and the government is so determined these villages do not exist, it has made sure that they are not signposted on Negev highways, nor marked on any map - how can they be connected to the national grid or the nearest reservoir? The destruction of AA&apos;s home, which involved the army first driving past dozens of ramshackle buildings just like it, is surely a warning as much as a punishment: this could happen to you, too. Isn&apos;t it time to move on? The Bedouin are Israeli citizens. They are eligible to vote, and must pay taxes, and many of them also opt to do national service in the Israeli army (Taysir Hayb, the 20-year-old soldier who killed Tom Hurndall, the British photographer, in Gaza in 2004, and is now serving an 11-year sentence for manslaughter, was also a Bedouin). For AA, however, the situation is more than usually ironic. As a teacher, she is employed full time by the very state that has just razed her home to the ground. &apos;Why do I deserve this?&apos; she says in a flat voice. &apos;In my work I must teach the children about independence, the founding of the state, all the other national myths. But still they come and they knock down my house.&apos; She takes me into the shed where she and her three children, together with her 70-year-old mother-in-law, are now living. It is the size of the garage that you might find attached to a suburban British semi. Three of its walls are made of corrugated iron, a fourth from a blanket and a plastic sheet. At one end are the things she and her neighbours managed to salvage from her house: a plastic bowl filled with bits and pieces of china, an ancient refrigerator, a bunch of ornamental flowers, a couple of mangled window frames. At the other end is a frying pan on a Calor gas stove and some blankets: this is where the family cooks, and sleeps. The place is entirely open to the elements (and to the rats: refuse and open sewers are a problem in the unrecognised villages, and rats love both). It is now November: the desert nights are cold, and getting more so every day. How long will she be able to survive here?  &apos;It&apos;s hard to know,&apos; she says, with a shrug. And then - unwilling to abandon the traditional rules of hospitality for all that she cannot make us mint tea - she pours Coca-Cola into plastic cups, and smilingly insists we drink. Facts about human suffering are troublingly abstract until you have experienced them for yourself, even if only on the tiniest, most feeble scale, so I&apos;m staying in Al-Zarnouk - population 1,250 - for a couple of nights. My host is BB (thanks to the tribal custom of cousin marriages, a tradition designed to avoid land disputes, pretty much everyone in Al-Zarnouk is an Al-Queda). Like many of the men here, BB&apos;s husband, CC, is a polygamist: she is the second of his three wives (under sharia, a man is entitled to four), and he now lives with the third, a fact that she finds hard. She has 11 children and virtually no income because, though CC works - something that is quite unusual in a community where unemployment is officially around 36 per cent, but is probably much higher - he gives her very little money; his third wife, DD, has nine children, so possibly he has other priorities.  BB takes comfort, however, in the fact that his first wife, EE, also a mother of 11, is her close friend. BB had not wanted to marry CC, her cousin, at all. She was in love with a man from another family.  But her father was having none of it, even when she went on hunger strike. Once it was clear that she had no choice in the matter, she went to EE and explained her feelings, whereupon the two women clasped one another and burst into tears. These days, they are united by a new tragedy: the advent of DD, whom they regard as a flirt. One last thing. All three of the women&apos;s children are of similar ages: they have sometimes been pregnant at the same time, a fact that often makes it difficult to work out who is who. My stay begins with a tour. I visit the refuse tip at the edge of the village, three mountains of waste so stinking it is all I can do not to gag, and I am shown one of the rudimentary and very noisy generators some people here use to obtain their three or four hours of electricity a night (only those who can afford it use generators; others make do with an oil lamp and go to bed soon after nightfall). It&apos;s not just that these things are unpleasant; they are confusing, too, because they are so unnecessary.  Israel is not a developing country. On my way to Al-Zarnouk, I drove through Omer, a gated Jewish suburb of Be&apos;er Sheva, the Negev&apos;s biggest city. Omer is one of the richest communities in Israel (three Be&apos;er Sheva suburbs are on the list of Israel&apos;s 10 richest towns), and its modern houses, with their desert views and suspiciously lush gardens, look like they have come straight out of the pages of a piece of Californian property porn. Omer is less than 20 minutes&apos; drive from Al-Zarnouk. On a clear day you can actually see it. As if this were not bad enough, the pylons that carry electricity from Be&apos;er Sheva to Omer and then beyond, to cities like Arad, march through this very village. An iron foot belonging to one of them stands right by the generator I&apos;m currently looking at, next to a small area where a family&apos;s goats and sheep are penned (residents can no longer graze animals on, or farm, the land outside the village; the Israeli government used to spray it with pesticides to prevent this - and when the practice was outlawed by Israel&apos;s high court, it found other ways, such as driving tractors through the crops). One of BB&apos;s daughters points up at the pylon - as if I could miss it. But she doesn&apos;t say anything. She doesn&apos;t need to. We are now walking in the gloaming: I am already painfully aware of the insult that it represents. BB&apos;s house is like all Bedouin houses: tiny, thrown up, cobbled together. If the big bad wolf huffed and puffed at this place, it would blow down in an instant. The Bedouin used to be nomadic, moving across the desert with their animals according to the season - a fact that the Israeli government likes to use against them: how can you own your lands, it asks, if you are nomads? (No matter that the British Mandate acknowledged the Bedouin&apos;s claim to the very same lands in the Twenties, and the Ottoman empire before it). But the Negev Bedouin were in the process of becoming sedentarised as along ago as the 19th century, and, in satellite photographs, there is evidence to suggest that dwellings were built on these barren hills in the middle of the last century, and perhaps before. (In the Sixties and Seventies, many Bedouin used to pitch a traditional tent, woven from the hair of black goats, beside their houses, but since no one can keep goats in sufficient quantities any more, only those few who make a living from tourism continue with this practice.)  BB&apos;s house is far superior to most 21st-century Bedouin homes: this part of Al-Zarnouk has clean water, which comes from a tank someone has managed to install in the village, and she is connected. But this is not saying a lot. Poverty, combined with the constant fear of demolition, means that many Bedouin live in slum conditions. &apos;Which century do you think you are in?&apos; she says with a smile as I look about - and it&apos;s true that I cannot imagine anyone in Tel Aviv living like this.  There are three rooms. One for sitting in, one for sleeping in, one for the preparation of food. BB&apos;s furniture amounts to five plastic garden chairs, a double bed - I, like her children, will sleep on the floor - and an old television. Out back, in a rickety lean-to, is the old metal bread oven in which pitta is baked over a wood fire. The room fills with smoke on bread-baking days, so perhaps it is just as well that you can see the sky through its breeze-block walls. Here, too, food is fried in a pan on a gas burner on the floor. In the evenings, when it is pitch black, this room is an extremely dangerous place to be. In my honour, BB has managed to &apos;borrow&apos; some electricity from a neighbour with a generator - she does not own one herself - and she has brought it into her house via a terrifying arrangement of dangling wires. For three hours, then, we have a light bulb and Al-Jazeera. Nine-year-old FF, BB&apos;s youngest child, lies on her stomach beside this single bulb, desperately trying to do her homework - a sight that makes me wonder all over again at the fact that GG, her older sister, is now a Hebrew language student at Ben-Gurion University. How does anyone study here? At six we eat: chicken and rice, bread, a few slices of cucumber and tomato, oranges. We talk. BB tells me that her house has only been demolished once, and that was a long time ago, before the Gulf war. But EE&apos;s house, which is next door, has been knocked down twice; after the second time, she fell into a deep depression. By 8pm, we are ready to go to bed: such is the quality of the darkness there is simply nothing else to be done. I lie in my sleeping bag on a rug on the concrete floor and hope that sleep will come quickly. If it does, I won&apos;t have to identify the source of the animal scratching I can hear above BB&apos;s nocturnal sighs. There are 160,000 Bedouin in Israel, of whom roughly half live in &apos;unrecognised&apos; villages. They comprise 25 per cent of the northern Negev&apos;s population, but live on only 2 per cent of its land - a fact that makes Israel&apos;s apparent fear and loathing of them seem particularly disproportionate. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, many of them fled the Negev, or were expelled to Eygpt and Jordan.  &apos;I remember it well,&apos; says BB&apos;s mother HH, who is in her seventies. &apos;We saw the tanks, so we put our tents on the camels and moved. We lived just outside Hebron [in the West Bank] for a year. We felt like refugees. But the land does not have legs; it cannot get up and walk. No one was cultivating it. So we came back, and life went on as it had before.&apos;  Her family was relatively lucky in that it returned to its own land. Others did not get off so lightly. In the Fifties and Sixties, those who had stayed behind were relocated by the Israeli government to a triangular zone - the Siyag - in the northeast of the Negev, on land that was relatively infertile. Meanwhile, outside the Siyag, expulsions continued. The Bedouin were removed, their place names erased from official maps. Towns were then given new Hebrew names. &apos;Just as we do not recognise the Arabs&apos; proprietorship of the land, so also we do not recognise their spiritual proprietorship and their names,&apos; said David Ben-Gurion, the prime minister, who appointed the committee that carried out this task. With the founding of the State of Israel came some benefits for the remaining Bedouin: mandatory education meant that literacy levels rose and healthcare was theoretically more widely available. But the discrimination continued. In the Sixties Moshe Dayan, then minister of agriculture, made the now-infamous statement in which he spoke of a &apos;revolution&apos; in which the Bedouin would become an urban proletariat: &apos;His children will get used to a father who wears trousers, who does not carry a dagger and who does not pick out their nits in public. They will go to school, their hair combed. This will be a revolution, and it will be achieved in two generations. Without coercion but with governmental direction ... this phenomenon of the Bedouin will disappear.&apos;  In the Seventies another agriculture minister, Ariel Sharon, declared much of the Negev a nature reserve, out of bounds to Bedouin herders, and established the Green Patrol to police it. Some 900 Bedouin encampments were removed during this period, and goat herds cut by a third. In the same decade, the government established the seven urban townships to which Bedouin could move on renunciation of their ancestral lands. Denied access to their grazing rights, and to basic services in the unrecognised villages, thousands took the miserable decision to move, and thousands came to regret it: today, life in townships such as Laqia and Hura is better than in the unrecognised villages, but only marginally so. In Laqia - the home, incidentally, of the only Bedouin Knesset member, Talab Al-Sana - there is no proper sewage system and no waste collection. Roads, where they exist at all, are poor. The townships were not properly planned. The Bedouin birth rate is one of the highest in the world (7.6 children per woman in 2005): as land runs out, families build insanitary shacks and pray that God will bless them with mild winters and gentle summers. In the past few years, 59 new Jewish farms have been established in the Negev, isolated properties that the local authorities usually connect to water and electricity grids without hesitation, even if their owners have not yet secured building permits. Meanwhile, in the unrecognised Bedouin villages, people struggle on without either of these things. Even the villages&apos; medical centres - clinics that have been established thanks to the lobbying efforts of organisations such as Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), which regularly petition the high court on such matters - must run on generators, which means, among other things, that they cannot refrigerate medicine 24 hours a day. &apos;All the improvements that have come to the villages so far have come only with the involvement of the high court,&apos; says Shlomit Avni, the head of the residence department at PHR. &apos;The first clinic did not open until 1995, but even now there are still only 11.&apos;  You might imagine, of course, that once the high court has acknowledged that residents in a particular village have a right to a clinic, this would lead to recognition of the village in the more general sense: how can a village that does not exist require health services? Not so. &apos;In 2006, we appealed to the court to connect the house of a child with cancer to the grid; the family needed electricity to keep his medicine cold. The court turned down our appeal. It argued that the child&apos;s health was his parents&apos; responsibility, and that they chose to live in an unrecognised village.&apos;  So the demolitions continue. Ministry of interior records show that government demolitions in the Negev more than doubled, from 143 in 2005 to 367 in 2006. The army does not limit itself to destroying domestic homes; it has also been known to demolish businesses, agricultural buildings and even mosques. Since 2005 it has been possible to file a demolition order against a building without its owner&apos;s knowledge. Things have tailed off more recently - there were 200 demolitions in 2007 - but there is a widespread suspicion among the Bedouin and many of the NGOs that work in the area that this is just the quiet before another storm. As you sweep along the smooth highway that leads out of Be&apos;er Sheva to the city of Dimona, the unrecognised villages, hunkered down on far off hills, don&apos;t look too bad. It&apos;s only when you get close that you realise how squalid they are and, since the roads to them are unmarked, few people are likely to make a detour. Do Israelis know what conditions their fellow citizens are living in? Avni believes that most do not. But even if they did, they would not necessarily be sympathetic. &apos;Those who do know have a big fear which sits on racism,&apos; she says. &apos;It&apos;s demographic: they&apos;re taking our land. There&apos;s no real reason for this: we&apos;re talking about 2 per cent of the Negev. Unfortunately, an Israeli Jew doesn&apos;t always make a distinction between a Bedouin Arab, who has done army service, and a Palestinian, who has not. They all look the same. So there&apos;s another basic fear that is very hard to overcome - a security fear.&apos; The statistics, however, are striking. Israel has a national health insurance scheme which entitles all residents to access to a health &apos;basket&apos;, irrespective of income. It is considered progressive and efficient, and health outcomes in the country are good. So why, then, is the infant-mortality rate among the Bedouin population so high (15.5 for every 1,000 in 2006) compared to that of the Jewish population (three for every 1,000 in 2006)? (In the wider Israeli Arab population, the figure is eight for every 1,000; the Bedouin are, as Avni points out, at &apos;the very bottom of the heap&apos;).  The Bedouin are ill, mostly due to the lack of clean water available to them. Intestinal infections are common, diarrhoea endemic during the summer. In a sirocco, when the wind whips up, the dust rises and temperatures peak, 60 per cent of the children in Negev hospitals are Bedouin, a figure that sometimes rises to 80 per cent during the summer. Bedouin children and older adults suffer disproportionately from respiratory diseases such as asthma because their iron houses are so hot by day and so cold by night; their villages full of burning garbage; their homes too close to Israel&apos;s main hazardous waste facility, Romat Hovav (the site is also home to 19 chemical factories).  The 11 clinics in the unrecognised villages are often inaccessible - public transport does not extend here - and keep short hours due to restrictions on their electricity. The doctors who work in them often do not speak Arabic, Israel&apos;s second official language (some 50 per cent of Bedouin women cannot speak Hebrew, and most are illiterate in it). Emergency services are effectively nonexistent: either ambulances cannot find the villages or their drivers refuse to enter them. As a result of the demolitions, rates of mental illness are also very high - particularly among women, for whom the home is so central to their sense of self. The Regional Council for the Unrecognised Arab Bedouin Villages - which was established in 1997 and whose work is supported by, among others, Oxfam - lobbies policy makers on behalf of the community. Like PHR, it has found that the only real way of effecting change is through appealing to the courts. But it is slow work. &apos;Our dreams are dead,&apos; says II, one of its members. Ibrahim lives in Wadi Ani&apos;am, the nearest unrecognised village to Ramat Hovav. Between 1948 and 1953 most of his tribe were forced out of the Negev, to Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai. In 1953 the remaining members were moved into the triangle.  &apos;On Fridays, I take my sons and grandsons, and show them the old lands. The old lands are known, and clear; everyone knows them by name. Show me a map, and I can tell you who owns what. But anyone who thinks we will ever get them back is dreaming.&apos; The people of Wadi Ani&apos;am have made history by being the first to agree to move en masse; they can live with the fumes emanating from Ramat Hovav no longer. But they are determined not to go to a township. &apos;We are an agricultural-based community. We want to be recognised as such, never mind where. We want to herd sheep, grow basic crops. Rates of cancer are too high here. The nearest clinic is 4km away.&apos; Like many older Bedouin men, II has an extra reason for feeling aggrieved at the state. From 1971 to 1974 he did military service in the Israeli army. &apos;I did it in order to prevent anyone from accusing me of not fulfilling my duties to the state,&apos; he says (service is optional for the Bedouin - and his sons, having seen that their father reaped no benefits from it, have chosen not to volunteer). Later, he worked for an Israeli company, mining bromide. As he makes clear, he does not have a problem with the Israeli state per se - only with the way it treats his people. The Bedouin are not politicised like the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza; they only want to be allowed to live freely, and with dignity. &apos;Perhaps this sounds strange, but the regime does not concern us. There were the Ottomans, the British, the Israelis. Who knows who will come next? The only steady thing is the right to live over our lands.&apos;  Does he feel the Bedouin have become invisible? He smiles, and rolls his eyes. &apos;Everyone knows about the Palestinians. But the Arabs inside Israel are forgotten, even in Arab countries. We want to say to them: &quot;We are Muslims and we pray, just like you.&quot;&apos; Some good things are happening in the villages. It would be wrong to suggest otherwise. Though the dropout rate is still high, most Bedouin children now have access to schooling, even if they must slog along dangerous, dusty roads to meet a bus that is unable to enter their village. At Ben-Gurion University in Be&apos;er Sheva some 600 Bedouin students, through sheer stubbornness and hard work, are studying for degrees (the Bedouin mutter that most of the scholarships available are for women, a strategy on the part of a government that believes education will take them &apos;out of the fertility cycle&apos;, but the figures do not back up this argument - and even if they did, I am not at all sure this is a bad thing). In Al-Zarnouk and other villages, women like BB are learning to read courtesy of a scheme run by a community organisation, Sidreh, and supported by Oxfam. Sidreh also runs a project, based in Lakia, in which traditional Bedouin weaving skills have been revived and used to build a thriving business selling rugs, bags and cushions. Last April a women&apos;s group, supported by Oxfam and PHR, went to Jerusalem and addressed Knesset members - it was the first time their voices had been heard there. But back in Al-Zarnouk, it is hard to feel optimistic. When we wake up, we discover that rats - the source of the scratching, I presume - got into BB&apos;s chicken pen last night, and decapitated at least one bird. I spend the day carrying out a series of misery-inducing interviews: a woman who was attacked by rats as she slept; a woman whose husband died because she had no electricity for his respiratory equipment; a woman whose three-year-old son lost a hand after it was caught in her electricity generator. &apos;He was playing with a stick, and when it got caught in the generator, he put his hand in to catch it,&apos; says JJ. &apos;We only found him when someone noticed that the sound of the generator was different. He was courageous at first. He bore it. Now, he&apos;s more vulnerable, more feeble. He wants to sleep next to me, even though he is 12 years old.&apos; She has never received any compensation for his injury and wonders, with good reason, how her son is going to make his way in the world. This isn&apos;t picturesque, noble, rural poverty; this isn&apos;t the way of life you might have read about in the books of Wilfred Thesiger and other Orientalist travellers. It&apos;s grim: dirty, ugly, claustrophobic; animals too close to people; people too close to the hazards afforded by a cut-price version of modern life, to gas canisters and oil cans, ancient tractors and broken-down cars.  It&apos;s also boring. When BB was a girl she spent her days herding, an option not open to her now. &apos;I&apos;m ready to be a belly dancer, I&apos;m so bored and so poor,&apos; she says (belly dancing is about the most shameful job a traditional Muslim woman can do). Is boredom perhaps one reason why she has so many children? No. &apos;It&apos;s haram [forbidden] to refuse your husband,&apos; she says. Polygamy, however, is dying out. &apos;The older men regard the one with only one wife as a weakling: he might as well have only one eye. But it&apos;s almost over. Most younger men do not even want two wives - and if they did, the women would probably not go along with it.&apos; She is proud that her daughter GG has made it to university, but it is also her contention that the Israeli state&apos;s refusal to recognise villages like Al-Zarnouk makes life especially hard for women. When honour killings happen, for instance, the police are unwilling to investigate. Come nightfall, we are huddled together once again, eating hummus. DD, the third wife, is persuaded to visit; BB knows that I am curious to meet her, so she puts up with her presence, tight-lipped. Once again we have borrowed some electricity and, after we&apos;ve eaten, a big family group - all three wives, three daughters, a daughter-in-law and BB&apos;s mother - settles down to watch a Turkish telenovela, The Tears of the Rose. This is their absolute favourite show, and for the next hour they are entranced by its magnificently silly plot (so am I). Then, abruptly, it is bedtime again. Once everyone else is lying down, the door locked, an oil lamp lit for comfort, BB drags her aching bones into bed, keen to make the most of the hours before we are woken by the dawn call to prayer. \u00b7 The names in the article above have been replaced with pseudonym initials.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-30T00:01:00Z", "title": "OM meets Israeli Bedouin women whose homes were destroyed by soldiers", "sentences": ["&apos;Which century do you think you are in?&apos; she says with a smile as I look about - and it&apos;s true that I cannot imagine anyone in Tel Aviv living like this."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/30/negev-bedouin-israeli-citizens-women"}, {"tags": ["Mumbai terror attacks", "Judaism", "World news", "Religion"], "article": "If you don&apos;t like it when Jews complain about being singled out, the slaughter in Mumbai should give you food for thought. In an attack that was in all other respects indiscriminate, two of the terrorists were specifically sent to the one building in the city where there were sure to be Jews. If terrorists intended to deliver a message that Jews can be attacked with impunity even in places where barely any of them live, it was received loud and clear.  I visited the Chabad House in Dharamsala over the summer and remember thinking how easy it would be for terrorists to wreak havoc there. Chabad-Lubavitch is one of the largest Hasidic Jewish sects. Where Ultra-Orthodox Judaism is known for its rejection of the outside world, Chabad bucks the trend. On the instructions of its late Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Chabad emissaries were dispatched to every corner of the globe, with instructions to provide religious life and emotional support to the local Jewish community. Today, there are Chabad houses all over the world, from New York to Kinshasa, from Mumbai to Bishkek, tending to the needs of tens or hundreds of people.  I have never particularly appreciated the proselytising aspect of the Chabad mission. It still irritates me when I am accosted in a Tel Aviv street by a chabadnik asking me to lay tefillin. But this is outreach exclusively to the secular Jewish world. Unlike evangelical Christians, Chabad are not interesting in converting those around them, and make great efforts to be a quiet, harmless part of their local community. In this sense, the Mumbai attacks mark the end of their innocence. In the midst of the maudlin clamour for explanation, one thing is clear: the terrorists who targeted Mumbai wanted to kill Jews. In succeeding in this goal, they instantly gave the lie to the disingenuous suggestion that Israel is the most dangerous place on earth for a Jew to live. And in choosing their target, they also gave the lie to the idea that this was some kind of proportionate response to the oppression of the Palestinians. If that was their agenda, they could have targeted the Israeli consulate. Instead, they attacked a Jewish communal centre, and in the process killed a Hasid from the Satmar movement, known for its virulent anti-Zionism. If you think this to be ironic, by the way, this means you fail to see the wood from the trees. We are frequently told that Islamist terrorists \u2013 whether from South Yorkshire or South Asia \u2013 are merely expressing their anger at injustices perpetrated against Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kashmir and Palestine. Why do these injustices lead them to violence where others don&apos;t? What about the plight of Muslims in Iran, Syria and China? Why does this not make them want to launch terrorist attacks? When will people begin to recognise a problem for what it is? India has now become the new frontline, absorbing provocation after provocation, while showing admirable restraint in response (if only Israel would occasionally follow its lead). In the summer, I wrote unequivocally in favour of Kashmiri self-determination, emphasising the human rights abuses Indian forces have committed there. In this sense, the situation is just like Palestine: it should be perfectly easy to argue for self-determination for Kashmiris and Palestinians without descending into apologetics when lunatics hovering at the fringes of their independence movements decide to mow down civilians.  I always used to respond with cynicism when told that my synagogue in London is tightening its security procedures. Now I know they are right to be worried. For the Jewish world, Mumbai is proving to be a 9/11 moment. Suddenly, every Chabad House in the world has become a potential target. This, unfortunately, is the disproportionate power of terrorism in the internet age.  Remarkably, though, Mumbai also offers inspiration. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka were killed in the attack but according to reports, a replacement is already preparing to go to Mumbai to run the Chabad centre. There is even the suggestion that Rivka&apos;s parents might take up the position. To an unreconstructed secularist, this is deeply humbling; the perfect embodiment of Barack Obama&apos;s famous election-night words: &quot;To those who would tear this world down, we will defeat you.&quot; May we all be lucky enough to have Chabad&apos;s resolve.

Nor is there any doubt that there have been many human rights abuses since the 1980s in particular. However, the situation is by no means as straightforward as William Dalrymple suggested in his article linking the Mumbai atrocities to the situation in Kashmir.  He seems to have lost sight of the fact that many sections of the Islamic radical and terrorist movements no longer have limited goals relating to Kashmir or Palestine. Their rage, if that is what it is, is more generalised. He quotes the leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba as saying that the aim of the organisation is to see the Islamic flag flying over Washington, Tel Aviv and New Delhi. A few years ago, an Islamist leader in India is reported to have said: &apos;Today, I announce the break-up of India.&apos; Others have spoken of similar aims in relation to Andalusia and various places which were once under Islamic rule. These may be fantasies, but how do you negotiate with such people? Once Kashmir has been handed over, should we prepare to follow it up with Hyderabad, Delhi, Seville and Cordoba? The Kashmir problem certainly needs to be resolved, but Dalrymple is deluded in imagining that this will put an end to continuing terrorist attacks in India.Dr Ashok BerySenior lecturer in EnglishLondon Metropolitan University How can Israel persecute Bedouins? I can barely express my horror at the way the Israeli government and army are treating the Bedouins of the Negev Desert as described by Rachel Cooke (&apos;Daughters of the desert&apos;, Observer Magazine, last week). I cannot understand how the Israelis can treat them with such inhumanity, such brutality, and what can only be described as outright racism. How can the nation that suffered the murderous brutality of the Holocaust do these things? Michael KnowlesCongletonCheshire The main problem for Hisen Al-Queda and perhaps many like her is that her husband has two additional wives and 31 children. Surely Israel cannot be criticised for trying to get across to these people that their current lifestyles are unsustainable. Israel probably cannot do much about polgamy and honour killings, but it can assist the Bedouin women and their children by removing them from the squalor they live in. Also, women who are not in a position to &apos;refuse their husbands&apos; are being raped. Israel is attempting to change this culture and should be applauded.Bob WeatherheadOxford Don&apos;t be cavalier about Charles I Martine Brant tells us (&apos;I took liberties with The Devil&apos;s Whore&apos;, Comment, last week) that many of her daughter&apos;s friends are asking why there&apos;s no public holiday on 30 January, the day when Parliament cut off Charles I&apos;s head. Really? What very unusual teenage girls they must be.

That compensation payments for injured soldiers are derisory or that payments to victims of sexual or racial harassment are excessive? I do not know what Ms Fletcher or Mr Ghaffur earn or the merits of their cases. I do know that as a public sector manager, if I wished to bring such an action, it would be difficult, personally costly and likely to damage my future career. Awards of \u00a3200,000 or more may sound a lot ; however, at a relatively modest salary of \u00a325,000 per annum, this represents less than 10 years&apos; earnings. The last thing we need is to limit damages paid to victims, thus making it easier for employers to ignore the law.

The case emerged when the state rejected Sheikh Ahmed Abu Awaja&apos;s application to serve as the imam at a mosque in Jaffa, a neighbourhood south of Tel Aviv. He appealed to Tel Aviv&apos;s labour court after he was told that he did not get the job even though he was the only candidate to meet the requirements. The court is due to deliver its decision today. During the case the district prosecutor said that Abu Awaja had been rejected because the General Security Service, commonly known as the Shin Bet, believed he would &quot;jeopardise peace and security in Jaffa, especially in view of the sensitivity of the delicate relationship between the city&apos;s Jewish and Muslim populations&quot;. It has previously been revealed that the Shin Bet deems Israel&apos;s indigenous Arab minority population and public criticism of the state&apos;s Jewish character as security threats. It accuses Abu Awaja, who is a member of the Islamic Movement, of inciting hostility against Israel and its Jewish citizens. The Islamic Movement is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is opposed to Israel&apos;s existence, but Abu Awaja, who has been preaching for 15 years, says he has never advocated violence. &quot;I have called on people to act within the law. The Shin Bet&apos;s interference in my nomination is political persecution and it&apos;s been going on for years,&quot; he told the daily Haaretz. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (Acri), which released its annual state of human rights report yesterday, accused the Shin Bet of harassing Israel&apos;s indigenous minority Arab citizens and restricting freedom of expression. During the past year the security service has questioned Israeli-Arab MPs and Israeli-Arabs who work for human rights groups. The Shin Bet makes &quot;veiled, but occasionally overt&quot; threats and &quot;makes it clear&quot; to those being questioned &quot;that they are under constant surveillance, hints that there could be repercussions in their private life and [makes] warnings that if they continue with what they are doing they are liable to have criminal charges brought against them&quot;, Acri&apos;s report says. Abu Awaja&apos;s lawyer said that after his client applied for the job and before he sat the entrance exam, the Shin Bet summoned him for an interview, at which he was questioned about the subject of his sermons and events he attended. &quot;Since the establishment of Israel we have given the Arab minority the feeling they were second-rate citizens,&quot; said Dan Yakir, a lawyer from ACRI. &quot;They are very ambivalent about the state that defines itself as Jewish.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Monday December 8 2008.

It expects to have 500,000 charging points by the time the first cars are marketed.

The body, which promotes British values throughout the world, is reducing its work in Europe and expanding in the Middle East, Asia and China. But a report by the Commons public accounts committee blames its senior officials for failing to listen to staff concerns and creating a negative impact in implementing the changes. The non-executive chairman is Lord Kinnock, the former Labour leader. The internal dispute followed decisions to close a number of offices and teaching centres without consulting staff. In the last three years the council has closed its teaching centres in Bologna, Tel Aviv, Budapest, Varna in Bulgaria, Nagoya and Kyoto in Japan, Kosice in Slovakia and Chittagong in Bangladesh for economic reasons. Two teaching centres in Saudi Arabia and Istanbul in Turkey have been closed because of the threat of terrorist attacks, and in Moscow and St Petersburg because of deteriorating relations with the Russians. Another in Baku, Azerbaijan was closed after commercial sponsorship collapsed. The British Council still maintains a presence in these countries. The council is dropping some expensive English language courses for a foreign elite in capital cities and expanding cheaper regional courses to attract more people. It has failed to attract enough commercial sponsorship \u2013 that, according to MPs, is still falling. Edward Leigh, chairman of the public accounts committee, said: &quot;This move to regional projects has contributed towards the year-on-year decline in the amount of money received from sponsorship and partners. &quot;The programme of change, which has also involved the closure of offices in Europe and the move of resources to the Middle East and Asia to reflect new UK international priorities, has damaged staff morale. The council would do well to speak to its staff and listen to their views. &quot;The council must improve its customer service. For example, the council&apos;s teaching of English is a vital way of transmitting our language and culture across the world.

Fusako Shigenobu, who founded the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon in 1971, is serving a 20-year prison term for orchestrating the 1974 siege of the French embassy in The Hague. She was arrested in Osaka in November 2000 after secretly returning to Japan using a false passport and checking into a hotel disguised as a man. Once described as &quot;the empress of terror&quot; whose aim was a global socialist revolution, Shigenobu was suspected of being behind a string of hijackings and hostage seizures at the height of the cold war. Japan&apos;s supreme court will rule on her appeal within the next few months. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Shigenobu, 63, said: &quot;It is time that Japanese people like me, who fought for a political cause in an attempt to create a better society, are offered a political way out of the deadlock.&quot; Though she was not present during The Hague siege, in which two security guards were seriously injured, a court dismissed her appeal last year. She had &quot;played an essential role in the seizure of the embassy by asking a friendly Arab group to procure arms&quot;, the court said. &quot;There is no room for clemency.&quot; Though it had only about 40 members, the faction-riven Red Army frequently embarrassed the Japanese government as it plotted its attacks from safe havens in Lebanon, Libya, Syria and North Korea. Its bloodiest assault came in 1972, when three members opened fire on passengers collecting their luggage at Lod airport, Tel Aviv, killing 24 people and injuring 80. In the early 70s, Shigenobu&apos;s sultry looks and air of menace made her the darling of Japanese leftwing radicalism. But years later, as a guard led her into a windowless meeting room at Kosuge prison in Tokyo, she looked drawn and painfully thin. Shigenobu&apos;s lawyer, Kyoko Otani, said concerns were growing for her health and she was due to have medical tests. Her one daily meeting with visitors lasts no more than 10 minutes and she spends just half an hour a day outside in the permanent shade of the exercise yard. Dressed in a white jumper and fleece, Shigenobu offered a broad smile and greeting in English as she pressed the palm of her hand against the glass divider. In accordance with prison rules, the rest of the interview had to be conducted in Japanese. Now in her eighth year behind bars, she said the embassy seizure, at which she was not present, was the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a group with close ties to the Red Army. After spending almost 30 years on the run in the Middle East, Shigenobu returned to Japan believing she would serve between three and five years for using fake ID.  &quot;I regard myself as a political prisoner, in as much as I fought with all my strength to improve Japanese and international society, and to help the Palestinian people,&quot; she said. In 2001 she formally disbanded the Red Army from her prison cell and proclaimed the armed struggle over. &quot;If I am released I will continue the fight, but through peaceful means. The armed struggle was closely related to historical circumstances, and what is right in one time and place may not be right in another,&quot; she said. Shigenobu acknowledged the suffering the Red Army caused during its global reign of terror. &quot;I regret some aspects of the armed struggle ... the fact that innocent people were harmed and hostages were taken,&quot; she said. &quot;But my faction never killed a single person.

In public, Netanyahu declared it &apos;the best team that any party is capable of giving the country&apos;. In private, he was reportedly furious, particularly with the ascent of Feiglin. A successful petition to the Likud election committee has now raised regional representatives up the party list. As a result, Feiglin has been pushed down from 20th place to 36th, which means he may not win a seat. Current opinion polls have Likud well ahead of its closest rivals. Netanyahu&apos;s overall election chances do not appear to have been upset - Kadima, under the current Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, is in a distant second place - but the primary still leaves him with a more hawkish party than he wanted and that might bring sharp policy disputes in government.  &apos;What is important is that given that he is going to form a government, can he really govern?

Their cause is just, their aim is true \u2013 regardless of the brickbats hurled their way by the likes of NGO Monitor and other such detractors. Dropping everything in their home countries and relocating halfway round the world to help those who can&apos;t help themselves are qualities that ought to be admired by anyone with an interest in promoting global tolerance and goodwill among men.  However, there are occasions when, even with the best will in the world, those who have so selflessly devoted their time and energy to fighting the good fight show their true colours in the most alarming of ways. A case in point is the raging battle that developed on the RamallahRamallah mailing list this weekend, in response to a fairly innocuous, run-of-the-mill inquiry by one of the group&apos;s members.  &quot;Is there a proper, western-style gym in Ramallah?&quot; began the query. &quot;If so, where is it?&quot; Nothing too provocative there, although in the uber-sensitive forum of the aid workers&apos; foreign legion, such a turn of phrase was always going to be a red rag to this particular herd of bulls. And so it proved, with a two-pronged attack immediately launched by a pair of disgusted-of-Scandinavia respondents: &quot;You forgot to add: &apos;where only white people go,&apos;&quot; spat one girl. &quot;So it can&apos;t be &apos;proper&apos; if not &apos;western-style&apos;? If you miss western styles that much, get your ass out of here and keep it in your western world.&quot; Heady stuff, but nothing compared with the next outburst: &quot;What&apos;s a &apos;proper, western-style gym&apos;? Something like &apos;proper, western-style democracy&apos;? Anyway, I&apos;m sure/hope you didn&apos;t mean to offend \u2013 there are lots of nice gyms in Ramallah \u2026 and if you adjust your words/attitude you might even make some A-rab friends there.&quot;  With the bit between their collective teeth now, more outraged members dived into the fray, determined to stamp out the spectre of racism and colonialism that they feared was haunting their site, and their community at large. &quot;While I am not a historian of gyms, I do think that the TV and machine &apos;style&apos; of a modern gym could fairly be attributed to the western world,&quot; posited another, more contemplative, poster, before attempting some armchair analysis of the original user&apos;s mindset. &quot;Quite what a non-western-style gym would be I&apos;m not sure, and it may have been this fear of the unknown that led to the selection of the adjective.&quot; (At this point I waded in, somewhat unnecessarily, but hoping to at least take the sting out of the thread&apos;s tail: &quot;I am a historian of gyms -\u2013my book Gymnasia Throughout the Ages \u2013from Plato&apos;s Push-up Palace to Farringdon&apos;s Fitness First will be published in the spring. There are two chapters devoted to the clash of civilisations as seen through the eyes of bodybuilders, centring on Saladin&apos;s inaugural Mr Universe competition and the counter-tournament, Mr Galactic, sponsored by Richard the Lionheart. I hope that all who are participating in this latest argument will find the answers to their queries within the text of my work.&quot; Unsurprisingly, my aside was roundly ignored, as the furious respondents got on with their business of driving out the demon within their midst.)  &quot;When I became a member, I thought that the subjects of this group were interesting and more or less work-related,&quot; complained a dismayed Italian, &quot;but now I have my box full of emails of someone selling cars, other asking for gyms \u2013 very &apos;interesting&apos; topics!!! Where are we: in Tel Aviv? Or in Beverly Hills?&quot; The implication was clear \u2013 only in the decadent west (Beverly Hills) or Ramallah&apos;s evil twin city (Tel Aviv) would anyone be so self-centred or have so much time on their hands as to inquire politely about gymnasia at all, when here \u2013 in the real, gritty world of fighting the power from dawn till dusk \u2013 frivolities such as personal fitness come a long way down the list of priorities. In case anyone was in any doubt, the next reply ignored the implicit sarcasm of the last post, instead using a curious blend of upper- and lower-case letters to ram home the harsh reality of life on the wrong side of the green line: &quot;No, you are in a place where people are still trying to LIVE DESPITE NOT being in Tel Aviv.&quot; The battle is still raging even as I type, three days later. While to the majority of those responding, the wording of the initial gym inquiry spoke volumes about the apparent bigotry of the user, in fact it is the hysterical, hyper-sensitive reaction of the other members of the group which is most indicative of a deep-rooted malaise in the NGO world.  I am regularly accused of self-hatred on the threads of Cif, but nothing I&apos;ve ever said comes close to the outpourings of those above, for whom their western upbringings causes such despair and bitterness. Those leaving such caustic replies are so assailed with guilt for their European and American backgrounds, so desperate to prove that they are freed from the salubrious shackles that used to bind them, that they will use any opportunity \u2013 however unwarranted \u2013 to trumpet their reborn statuses to the world again and again. I&apos;ve seen it countless times, on both sides of the barricades. In Ramallah, there is a certain breed of westerner who, upon meeting a fellow light-skinned member of the human race, will nod disinterestedly and mumble a brief greeting, yet as soon as a Palestinian enters the room, literally swoons at their feet and hangs adoringly on their every word. Similarly, the fetishising of Israeli soldiers is a regrettable trait latent in many, from day-tripping tourist to seasoned commentators such as Julie Burchill and beyond, as though showering indiscriminate love over anyone in olive green combat gear should be de rigueur behaviour in the Middle Eastern petting zoo.  That&apos;s not to say that there aren&apos;t plenty of good-hearted, well-intentioned supporters on either side of the divide. However, when the mob-mentality masses descend like jackals on a fellow westerner for simply daring to casually inquire about Ramallah&apos;s gym facilities, it sends an alarming message about how deeply into the radical, save-the-world-but-discard-my-past mentality many in the region have sunk.

I was leading a mission that had intended to visit the West Bank and Gaza to prepare a report on Israel&apos;s compliance with human rights standards and international humanitarian law. Meetings had been scheduled on an hourly basis during the six days, starting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, the following day. I knew that there might be problems at the airport. Israel had strongly opposed my appointment a few months earlier and its foreign ministry had issued a statement that it would bar my entry if I came to Israel in my capacity as a UN representative.  At the same time, I would not have made the long journey from California, where I live, had I not been reasonably optimistic about my chances of getting in. Israel was informed that I would lead the mission and given a copy of my itinerary, and issued visas to the two people assisting me: a staff security person and an assistant, both of whom work at the office of the high commissioner of human rights in Geneva.  To avoid an incident at the airport, Israel could have either refused to grant visas or communicated to the UN that I would not be allowed to enter, but neither step was taken. It seemed that Israel wanted to teach me, and more significantly, the UN a lesson: there will be no cooperation with those who make strong criticisms of Israel&apos;s occupation policy.  After being denied entry, I was put in a holding room with about 20 others experiencing entry problems. At this point, I was treated not as a UN representative, but as some sort of security threat, subjected to an inch-by-inch body search and the most meticulous luggage inspection I have ever witnessed.  I was separated from my two UN companions who were allowed to enter Israel and taken to the airport detention facility a mile or so away. I was required to put all my bags and cell phone in a room and taken to a locked tiny room that smelled of urine and filth. It contained five other detainees and was an unwelcome invitation to claustrophobia. I spent the next 15 hours so confined, which amounted to a cram course on the miseries of prison life, including dirty sheets, inedible food and lights that were too bright or darkness controlled from the guard office.  Of course, my disappointment and harsh confinement were trivial matters, not by themselves worthy of notice, given the sorts of serious hardships that millions around the world daily endure. Their importance is largely symbolic. I am an individual who had done nothing wrong beyond express strong disapproval of policies of a sovereign state. More importantly, the obvious intention was to humble me as a UN representative and thereby send a message of defiance to the United Nations.  Israel had all along accused me of bias and of making inflammatory charges relating to the occupation of Palestinian territories. I deny that I am biased, but rather insist that I have tried to be truthful in assessing the facts and relevant law. It is the character of the occupation that gives rise to sharp criticism of Israel&apos;s approach, especially its harsh blockade of Gaza, resulting in the collective punishment of the 1.5 million inhabitants. By attacking the observer rather than what is observed, Israel plays a clever mind game. It directs attention away from the realities of the occupation, practising effectively a politics of distraction. The blockade of Gaza serves no legitimate Israeli function. It is supposedly imposed in retaliation for some Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets that have been fired across the border at the Israeli town of Sderot. The wrongfulness of firing such rockets is unquestionable, yet this in no way justifies indiscriminate Israeli retaliation against the entire civilian population of Gaza.  The purpose of my reports is to document on behalf of the UN the urgency of the situation in Gaza and elsewhere in occupied Palestine. Such work is particularly important now as there are signs of a renewed escalation of violence and even of a threatened Israeli reoccupation.  Before such a catastrophe happens, it is important to make the situation as transparent as possible, and that is what I had hoped to do in carrying out my mission. Although denied entry, my effort will continue to use all available means to document the realities of the Israeli occupation as truthfully as possible.\u2022 Richard Falk is professor of international law at Princeton University and the UN&apos;s special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories", "publicationDate": "2008-12-19T11:30:00Z", "title": "Richard Falk: My expulsion from Israel", "sentences": ["On December 14, I arrived at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, Israel to carry out my UN role as special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/19/israel-palestinian-territories-united-nations"}, {"tags": ["Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "North listings"], "article": "Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin present their pseudo-scientific photographic museum of worldwide curiosities.

The rockets have claimed 19 lives in the past eight years, but have become an increasingly serious problem for the Israeli government. To reduce the rocket fire, Israeli military analysts argue, is a modest goal. However, even within Israel there remain sharp differences of opinion about how to achieve that. Most believe the latest conflict will eventually end with a new lull in the fighting, or at best another short-term ceasefire agreement - the latest in a long line of temporary ceasefires in the conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza. Although Israel has put in place some preparations for a ground invasion, including preparing a call-up of reserves and deploying tanks near the Gaza border, that is still not seen as an inevitable step. Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli general and a military analyst at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said the point of the conflict was for Israel to exact the best conditions for a future ceasefire with Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls Gaza after winning Palestinian elections three years ago. &quot;The military operation is changing the dynamic, making it clear to Hamas that it is going to pay a very high cost for violations of the ceasefire,&quot; Brom said. &quot;I think Hamas deluded itself by thinking Israel is kind of paralysed because of its political system or the possible reaction of its population to some suffering.&quot; For nearly six months Israel and Hamas held a ceasefire in Gaza, although it broke down in the final weeks with violations on both sides. Now both Hamas and some Israeli leaders have said they are not willing to return to a ceasefire deal. Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, told Fox News on Saturday when the bombing began: &quot;For us to be asked to have a ceasefire with Hamas is like asking you [the US] to have a ceasefire with al-Qaida.&quot; The reality is that a new ceasefire agreement is probably the best Israel could hope to achieve. As Alex Fishman, a columnist on the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, put it bluntly yesterday: &quot;The answer to the question of what we want is simple: To stop the fire. In order to stop the fire, we have to reach an arrangement, and in order to persuade Hamas to reach an arrangement, we are now breaking its bones - among other reasons, so that the price it demands will not be high. But we have not yet decided, amongst ourselves, what price we are willing to pay.&quot; Yet there are others who raise broader questions about Israel&apos;s policy towards Gaza, particularly in the last three years since Hamas won the electoral victory. Yossi Alpher, a former official at Mossad and a military commentator, agreed that Israel was seeking a ceasefire on more acceptable terms. But he was critical of the tough economic blockade Israel has imposed on the Gaza Strip in recent years, limiting imports to humanitarian supplies and preventing all exports, a policy that has all but wiped out private industry and brought Gaza&apos;s economy to collapse. &quot;The economic siege of Gaza has not produced any of the desired political results,&quot; he said. &quot;It has not manipulated Palestinians into hating Hamas, but has probably been counter-productive. It is just useless collective punishment.&quot; He said that in future Israel would have to choose either to recognise Hamas was around to stay and to talk to the movement, however unpalatable that might be for most Israelis, or to fully reoccupy the Gaza Strip, topple Hamas and bear all the costs involved. Some have even spoken publicly against the current bombing in Gaza. Tom Segev, one of Israel&apos;s most respected historians, has been particularly critical, arguing that the premise of bombing to secure a peace agreement was false. &quot;Israel has also always believed that causing suffering to Palestinian civilians would make them rebel against their national leaders. This assumption has proven wrong over and over,&quot; Segev wrote in yesterday&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper. &quot;Since the dawn of the Zionist presence in the land of Israel, no military operation has ever advanced dialogue with the Palestinians.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-12-30T01:30:00Z", "title": "Gaza tactics and long-term goals divide Israeli military analysts", "sentences": ["Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli general and a military analyst at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said the point of the conflict was for Israel to exact the best conditions for a future ceasefire with Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls Gaza after winning Palestinian elections three years ago."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/israel-gaza-military-strategy"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US news", "Nato", "European Union", "United Nations", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas"], "article": "The assault on Gaza, planned over six months and executed with perfect timing, was designed largely, as Neve Gordon has rightly observed, to help the incumbent parties triumph in the forthcoming Israeli elections. The dead Palestinians are little more than election fodder in a cynical contest between the right and the far right in Israel. Washington and its EU allies, perfectly aware that Gaza was about to be assaulted, as in the case of Lebanon in 2006, sit back and watch.  Washington, as is its wont, blames the pro-Hamas Palestinians, with Obama and Bush singing from the same AIPAC hymn sheet. The EU politicians, having observed the build-up, the siege, the collective punishment inflicted on Gaza, the targeting of civilians etc (for all the gory detail, see Harvard scholar Sara Roy&apos;s chilling essay in the London Review of Books) were convinced that it was the rocket attacks that had &quot;provoked&quot; Israel but called on both sides to end the violence, with nil effect. The moth-eaten Mubarak dictatorship in Egypt and Nato&apos;s favourite Islamists in Ankara failed to register even a symbolic protest by recalling their ambassadors from Israel. China and Russia did not convene a meeting of the UN security council to discuss the crisis.  As result of official apathy, one outcome of this latest attack will be to inflame Muslim communities throughout the world and swell the ranks of those very organisations that the west claims it is combating in the &quot;war against terror&quot;. The bloodshed in Gaza raises broader strategic questions for both sides, issues related to recent history. One fact that needs to be recognised is that there is no Palestinian Authority. There never was one. The Oslo Accords were an unmitigated disaster for the Palestinians, creating a set of disconnected and shrivelled Palestinian ghettoes under the permanent watch of a brutal enforcer. The PLO, once the repository of Palestinian hope, became little more than a supplicant for EU money.  Western enthusiasm for democracy stops when those opposed to its policies are elected to office. The west and Israel tried everything to secure a Fatah victory: Palestinian voters rebuffed the concerted threats and bribes of the &quot;international community&quot; in a campaign that saw Hamas members and other oppositionists routinely detained or assaulted by the IDF, their posters confiscated or destroyed, US and EU funds channelled into the Fatah campaign, and US congressmen announcing that Hamas should not be allowed to run.  Even the timing of the election was set by the determination to rig the outcome. Scheduled for the summer of 2005, it was delayed till January 2006 to give Abbas time to distribute assets in Gaza \u2013 in the words of an Egyptian intelligence officer, &quot;the public will then support the Authority against Hamas.&quot;  Popular desire for a clean broom after ten years of corruption, bullying and bluster under Fatah proved stronger than all of this. Hamas&apos;s electoral triumph was treated as an ominous sign of rising fundamentalism, and a fearsome blow to the prospects of peace with Israel, by rulers and journalists across the Atlantic world. Immediate financial and diplomatic pressures were applied to force Hamas to adopt the same policies as those of the party it had defeated at the polls. Uncompromised by the Palestinian Authority&apos;s combination of greed and dependency, the self-enrichment of its servile spokesmen and policemen, and their acquiescence in a &quot;peace process&quot; that has brought only further expropriation and misery to the population under them, Hamas offered the alternative of a simple example. Without any of the resources of its rival, it set up clinics, schools, hospitals, vocational training and welfare programmes for the poor. Its leaders and cadres lived frugally, within reach of ordinary people.  It is this response to everyday needs that has won Hamas the broad base of its support, not daily recitation of verses from the Koran. How far its conduct in the second Intifada has given it an additional degree of credibility is less clear. Its armed attacks on Israel, like those of Fatah&apos;s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade or Islamic Jihad, have been retaliations against an occupation far more deadly than any actions it has ever undertaken. Measured on the scale of IDF killings, Palestinian strikes have been few and far between. The asymmetry was starkly exposed during Hamas&apos;s unilateral ceasefire, begun in June 2003, and maintained throughout the summer, despite the Israeli campaign of raids and mass arrests that followed, in which some 300 Hamas cadres were seized from the West Bank.  On August 19 2003, a self-proclaimed &quot;Hamas&quot; cell from Hebron, disowned and denounced by the official leadership, blew up a bus in west Jerusalem, upon which Israel promptly assassinated the Hamas ceasefire&apos;s negotiator, Ismail Abu Shanab. Hamas, in turn, responded. In return, the Palestinian Authority and Arab states cut funding to its charities and, in September 2003, the EU declared the whole Hamas movement to be a terrorist organization \u2013 a longstanding demand of Tel Aviv.  What has actually distinguished Hamas in a hopelessly unequal combat is not dispatch of suicide bombers, to which a range of competing groups resorted, but its superior discipline \u2013 demonstrated by its ability to enforce a self-declared ceasefire against Israel over the past year. All civilian deaths are to be condemned, but since Israel is their principal practitioner, Euro-American cant serves only to expose those who utter it. Overwhelmingly, the boot of murder is on the other foot, ruthlessly stamped into Palestine by a modern army equipped with jets, tanks and missiles in the longest-armed oppression of modern history.  &quot;Nobody can reject or condemn the revolt of a people that has been suffering under military occupation for 45 years against occupation force,&quot; said General Shlomo Gazit, former chief of Israeli military intelligence, in 1993. The real grievance of the EU and US against Hamas is that it refused to accept the capitulation of the Oslo Accords, and has rejected every subsequent effort, from Taba to Geneva, to pass off their calamities on the Palestinians. The west&apos;s priority ever since was to break this resistance. Cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority is an obvious weapon with which to bludgeon Hamas into submission. Boosting the presidential powers of Abbas \u2013 as publicly picked for his post by Washington, as was Karzai in Kabul \u2013 at the expense of the legislative council is another.  No serious efforts were made to negotiate with the elected Palestinian leadership. I doubt if Hamas could have been rapidly suborned to western and Israeli interests, but it would not have been unprecedented. Hamas&apos; programmatic heritage remains mortgaged to the most fatal weakness of Palestinian nationalism: the belief that the political choices before it are either rejection of the existence of Israel altogether or acceptance of the dismembered remnants of a fifth of the country. From the fantasy maximalism of the first to the pathetic minimalism of the second, the path is all too short, as the history of Fatah has shown.  The test for Hamas is not whether it can be house-trained to the satisfaction of western opinion, but whether it can break with this crippling tradition. Soon after the Hamas election victory in Gaza, I was asked in public by a Palestinian what I would do in their place. &quot;Dissolve the Palestinian Authority&quot; was my response and end the make-believe. To do so would situate the Palestinian national cause on its proper basis, with the demand that the country and its resources be divided equitably, in proportion to two populations that are equal in size \u2013 not 80% to one and 20% to the other, a dispossession of such iniquity that no self-respecting people will ever submit to it in the long run. The only acceptable alternative is a single state for Jews and Palestinians alike, in which the exactions of Zionism are repaired. There is no other way.  And Israeli citizens might ponder the following words from Shakespeare (in The Merchant of Venice), which I have slightly altered:   &quot;I am a Palestinian. Hath not a Palestinian eyes? Hath not a Palestinian hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Jew is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that \u2026 the villainy you teach me, I will execute; and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.&quot; ", "publicationDate": "2008-12-30T08:00:08Z", "title": "Tariq Ali: In the face of Israel's latest onslaught against Hamas in Gaza, the only option for Palestinian nationalism is to embrace a one-state solution", "sentences": ["In return, the Palestinian Authority and Arab states cut funding to its charities and, in September 2003, the EU declared the whole Hamas movement to be a terrorist organization \u2013 a longstanding demand of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/30/gaza-hamas-palestinians-israel1"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "Last week I was in the Middle East. I was meeting with renowned Muslim scholars, men who lead millions, in a move to condemn extremism and violence. We at the Quilliam Foundation made huge headway, with a high-profile regional event planned next year to help reshape the discourse surrounding Islam and the west.  At home in England, behind the scenes, Muslim leaders were also moving in the same direction. The air was becoming ripe for outright rejection of suicide bombings. Everywhere. Tel Aviv. London. No exceptions.  But now? After Israel&apos;s massacre of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, out on the streets of Cairo and Damascus it would be impossible to find credible voices that condemn suicide bombings in Israel. Thanks to its ruthless air strikes and economic blockade of Gaza, Hamas is stronger today than it was last week. Friday sermons across the Muslim world this week will see the worst condemnation of Israel, rightful support for the bealeagured Palestinian peoples \u2013 and a boost to the popularity of Hamas by default.  Regardless of political condemnations, the crude reality is that Israel has just helped create a new generation of suicide bombers, prepared to stop at nothing. The ideology that justifies and advocates suicide bombings already exists. Israel though, through its recent actions, has just provided the fire that will now re-ignite this poisoned gas. Prevented for now by Israel&apos;s wall and heavy security, the suicide bombers&apos; will to kill, to avenge will not calm. And where there is a will, victims will always find a way to lash out.  I have lived next to a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, Syria. I&apos;ve sat in homes of poor, hospitable Palestinians who still yearn to return to their homeland, taken by force from them in the turmoil after Britain hurriedly left Palestine in 1948.  I am no friend of Hamas, or Islamist movements. I&apos;ve spoken out in support of Israel&apos;s right to exist, beside a strong Palestinian state, in gatherings and places where it has brought me significant harm. But Israel&apos;s cold, politically timed killing of more than 300 Palestinians makes me, and millions more, rethink our attitude towards Israel.  Yesterday, the Quilliam Foundation sent out this statement, and within moments we had complaints from senior officials in the United States and others who blindly support Israel. Granted, Hamas is an irresponsible, senile and fanatical organisation that repeatedly puts its people at risk, but Israel&apos;s calculated killing and attempts at deception cannot be overlooked. How can the children of Holocaust survivors become such brutal killers? And during the Sabbath?  The Arabs have strong notions of collective honour, dignity, and respect. And a very long memory when it suits them. In headlines for the past 60 years, they have been crying out against Israeli occupation and aggression, while watching the incompetence of their governments and the hypocrisy of the west \u2013 particularly America \u2013 in issuing blank cheques to Israel. An attack on Gaza is being seen as an attack on the Arab people as a whole: from Yemen to Morocco, Arab anger and sense of powerlessness is palpable. How much more can the Arabs take?  At schools across the Arab world children are taught about the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916. Here in Britain, we might want to forget this imperial past, but ask any Arab and they will reel off these dates and confirm Britain&apos;s involvement in creating Israel. As a country, we have a moral duty to right our historical wrongs. We helped create Israel. We must now help create a Palestine. Our political class can, and should, exert pressure on Washington to rein in Israel to help Palestine emerge.  David Miliband was received warmly in Damascus recently. And Muslims representing Britain in Muslim-majority countries have been proudly making the case for a Britain that stands for justice, peace and fairness. The Foreign Office can make a difference. Human rights and a free civil society should not be the passing fads of Labour foreign secretaries, but serious, aid-related policy aims.  Finally, the government has poured in millions to the Prevent Violent Extremism (PVE) agenda. Spending taxpayers&apos; money, while not addressing genuine grievances of young Muslims, will undermine the battle of ideas raging in websites and social spaces of young Muslims. And worse, strengthen Islamist ideology that feeds off these grievances.  Britain cannot solve the Arab-Israeli conflict. But it can, and must, pressure the next US administration to be fair and even-handed in the Middle East. \u2022 Ed Husain is director of the Quilliam Foundation", "publicationDate": "2008-12-30T12:00:01Z", "title": "Ed Husain: Britain has a duty to Arabs", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/30/israelandthepalestinians-middleeast"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Emergency medical supplies were being flown to the Middle East yesterday to help Gaza&apos;s overstretched hospitals, where doctors say they are still struggling to cope with hundreds of injured patients. Doctors at the Shifa hospital, a 585-bed complex which is the largest in Gaza, said they had treated patients on the floor and conducted operations with as many as three different patients and a dozen doctors crowded into each operating theatre.  All 25 intensive care beds were full, said Dr Hussain Ashaur, the hospital director, and there were still another 87 patients in a critical condition waiting to enter intensive care. He said there were severe shortages of medical supplies, including gauze, sterilisation fluids and anaesthetics. In total 135 types of medical supplies were needed and 94 separate medicines. Sheets and cloth for intensive care beds were in such short supply that they were being washed three times a day.  Doctors said they were overwhelmed on Saturday, with the first rush of large numbers of injured patients, although pressure had eased slightly on Monday and yesterday. Still, the hospital was in a fragile state, Ashaur said. &quot;We&apos;re close to collapsing if this situation continues. We have shortages of everything,&quot; he said.  The hospital was running on generators yesterday after a break in the electricity supply, and already one of its three generators had broken down and could not be repaired because of a lack of spare parts. The International Committee of the Red Cross was to fly in 11 tonnes of supplies to Tel Aviv, which it hoped would then be allowed into Gaza. A Red Cross surgical team is on standby to fly in as well, as soon as it receives permission from the Israeli authorities. The World Health Organisation is to fly 50 surgical kits from Norway to Israel, with enough supplies to treat 5,000 wounded people. Another nine basic health kits, enough for three months&apos; treatment of 90,000 people with common illnesses, is also to be sent. However, for several months Israel has allowed only limited supplies of humanitarian goods into Gaza and no other imports or exports. That has left Gaza&apos;s health system in a state of crisis, according to Physicians for Human Rights, an Israeli group.  It said even before Israel&apos;s latest bombing campaign began on Saturday that the Gazan health system was &quot;operating under severe shortages and limitations&quot;. As well as shortages of medical equipment and trained personnel, there were shortages of medicine and a broader lack of knowledge and training in dealing with complex diseases and injuries.  Israel allowed around 100 trucks of humanitarian supplies into Gaza yesterday, a much higher number than usual but still a long way below the numbers passing through before the economic blockade was imposed last year. Physicians for Human Rights said it knew of six patients in intensive care at the Shifa hospital who needed treatment outside Gaza but were too weak to travel the seven hours by road to Cairo.  The group said hospitals in Israel, as in the past, were ready to take the patients but the only crossing they would use out of Gaza, at Erez, had been closed since Friday. The group, together with other Israeli human rights groups, sent a letter to the Israeli defence ministry asking that patients be allowed out. In the Shifa hospital yesterday doctors described working 20-hour days just to keep up with the flood of patients. &quot;We thought we were in a critical situation in the past, but when we saw this we realised what had gone before was nothing,&quot; said Dr Nabil Shawa, head of orthopaedics.  &quot;We&apos;re not prepared for this number of casualties. There were so many people I couldn&apos;t move freely from one room to the next. Besides, I have my family, and my children were at school and I was trying to reach them to know that they were safe. You can just imagine the effort, the worry. We&apos;re exhausted.&quot; Oxfam called for an immediate ceasefire to allow in sufficient humanitarian supplies. &quot;What is needed is an immediate ceasefire to end the terrible levels of human suffering in Gaza,&quot; said Jeremy Hobbs, director of Oxfam International.", "publicationDate": "2008-12-31T00:01:00Z", "title": "Shortages put hospitals on the brink of collapse", "sentences": ["The International Committee of the Red Cross was to fly in 11 tonnes of supplies to Tel Aviv, which it hoped would then be allowed into Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/31/israel-gaza-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "As the tanks gear up for war, so do groups across Israel \u2013 forgotten segments of the population who barely receive a mention in media coverage of the offensive on Gaza. Most reports suggest Israeli citizens are almost entirely in favour of the war in Gaza, supporting it as an overdue response to years of terror. Among those concerned directly with potential rocket attacks from Gaza, public support for the war has been high. Student Tamara Cycman from Rehovot agrees that supporting Israel&apos;s actions is normal for most Israelis and that most view these attacks as a kind of comfort, a positive step after years of shelling from Hamas. Cycman laments the violence, but defiantly states that the IDF makes every effort to warn citizens away from target areas and to minimise civilian casualties.  The government and its supporters have actively been making the case of moral legitimacy, arguing that fighting on despite an overwhelming military inferiority and being at a strategic disadvantage does not make Hamas justified but foolish. Such arguments have been taken up by international media, and the peace protests organised by organisations such as Gush Shalom have largely been ignored. Yet the response by the Israel peace movement has been swift and widespread, making up in fervour what it lost in lack of coverage. On December 27, Adam Keller of The Other Israel reported a march in the streets of Tel Aviv calling for an end to the violence. Following a call by the Coalition of Women For Peace, more than 1,000 people marched in Tel Aviv heading for the defence ministry amid cries of &quot;This is not my war&quot;. Keller reports a strong police presence shadowing the march which turned heavy-handed when mounted police charged the crowd and arrested several protesters trying to break through police lines. That these protests warranted only the briefest of mentions in the Israeli press is not surprising but they are nevertheless an important part of the peace process landscape. Every recent incarnation of the Israeli government has said it wishes for peace, but if so, why this systematic casting aside of those Israelis ready to commit to long-term peace?. Perhaps the most reach the Israeli peace movements have had to date is a large ad taken out in Haaretz calling for an end to the violence. Uri Avnery, a former Knesset member and founder of Gush Shalom said in a phone interview that a march of thousands is scheduled in Tel Aviv on 3 January to call for an end to the war and a real dialogue with Hamas. Although this goal would seem unreachable at present and despite Hamas&apos;s barbaric motives, dialogue is the only feasible solution. Avnery stated that so far the marches have comprised the usual peace activists, but hoped that dwindling support for the military campaign would push more people on to the streets to demand an end to the bloodshed.  Israeli public opinion still appears more ideological than practical and should defence minister Ehud Barak order a ground assault on Gaza, it is very likely his support will drop as Israeli soldiers are killed. Although the EU-proposed ceasefire was rejected, that Barak seemed to consider it spoke more of his electoral foresight than of any really convincing arguments from French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner. &quot;I don&apos;t trust Barak but the war is part of the election campaign, and he as well as Tzipi Livni may be satisfied with his heightened popularity,&quot; instead of risking in an incursion against Hamas.  Avnery stated that the Israeli public was shielded from the truth about the situation in Gaza and was not seeing the horrific images shown on networks like the Arabic al-Jazeera. Haaretz can be commended in showing both sides of the arguments but the wealth of aggressive comments to every article calling for peace shows just how deep sentiments run on this matter.  Israel is in the throes of debate over what constitutes a proportional response. Rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza have killed more than 20 Israeli civilians since 2000 and while this threat looms large over southern cities, the validity and effectiveness of an all-out attack against Hamas can be called into question. For Gush Shalom, the only option is the seemingly implausible notion of a full dialogue with Hamas, opening the checkpoints from Gaza into Israel and hacking out an armistice that Avnery feels could last 50 years. For the Knesset, the only reality is they are utterly out of ideas and no amount of hollow rhetoric as dust settles on Palestinian bodies will hide that for long from Israeli citizens.", "publicationDate": "2008-12-31T15:00:00Z", "title": "Chris Dalby: Israeli media coverage of the Gaza onslaught has largely ignored the protests by peace activists", "sentences": ["On December 27, Adam Keller of The Other Israel reported a march in the streets of Tel Aviv calling for an end to the violence.", "Following a call by the Coalition of Women For Peace, more than 1,000 people marched in Tel Aviv heading for the defence ministry amid cries of &quot;This is not my war&quot;.", "Uri Avnery, a former Knesset member and founder of Gush Shalom said in a phone interview that a march of thousands is scheduled in Tel Aviv on 3 January to call for an end to the war and a real dialogue with Hamas."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/31/israelandthepalestinians-middleeast2"}], "docs": 251, "sentences": 335}
