Small dried limes (or lemons) are a regular feature in Iranian cooking, adding a sharp tang to marinades, stews and salads, and a perfumy, sweetish aroma.

The British Israel Communication and Research Centre, known as Bicom, has been one of the most active organisations behind the scenes in the UK during the present Gaza offensive, organising briefings and interview opportunities with senior Israeli spokesmen. Its biggest funder is Poju Zabludowicz, a London-based tycoon, who has underwritten its campaigning since 2007. The disclosure comes amid an intense struggle in Britain between lobbying organisations working for both sides in the conflict. Foreign affairs specialists say that the injection of funds has ensured that Bicom has become one of the most persistent and slickest media operations in the battle for influence over opinion formers.  Company accounts show that Zabludowicz, whose fortune was founded on the success of his father&apos;s arms company, donated \u00a3937,995 to Bicom in 2007, around half its total income, and \u00a3341,694 in 2006.  Bicom, which claims to be an independent organisation devoted to seeking a more supportive environment for Israel, is at the forefront of the campaign to win over the British media. Foreign reporters are bombarded with press releases and invitations to interview senior Israeli ministers and advisors at top London restaurants. Set up in 2001, it has regularly flown journalists to Tel Aviv . Despite its prominence, Bicom has declined to discuss its operations. But insiders claim that the company is based in plush offices just off London&apos;s Oxford Street and employs more than 20 people. While the CEO is Lorna Fitzsimons, the former Labour MP for Rochdale, those close to the organisation say that Zabludowicz, the chairman, controls it. &quot;He and his associates are very important in defining the direction of the organisation,&quot; said one former employee.  Zabludowicz, 55, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and now lives in Hampstead, north London. He is the 31st richest man in Britain with a \u00a32bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.  His father, Shlomo, an Auschwitz survivor, built up the Israeli arms company Soltam in the 50s after working closely with Shimon Peres, who was then the director general of the Israeli defence ministry.  After Shlomo&apos;s death in 1994, his son took over the business and most of the defence interests were sold. The family business is now controlled through the Tamares Group, which is based in Liechtenstein, with huge property portfolios in Israel and Las Vegas. Some journalists believe that the resources behind Bicom have contributed to an improved image of Israel in the British media over the past seven years. One foreign reporter said: &quot;The scale of their activity is amazing. They fire off press releases several times a day, and have access to those at the very top of the Israeli government. You cannot compare then to the pro-Palestinian groups&apos; media operations, which are frankly amateurish.&quot;  One fellow director of Bicom dismissed claims that Zabludowicz is the main driving force behind Bicom. David Menton said that he is one of around 120 donors who have given to the organisation. &quot;As an organisation, Bicom is fortunate to benefit from the generosity of in excess of 100 donors, of which one of its pioneers is Poju Zabludowicz,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-04T00:01:00Z", "title": "How the pro-Israel lobby in Britain benefits from a generous London tycoon", "sentences": ["Set up in 2001, it has regularly flown journalists to Tel Aviv ."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/04/biscom-israel-lobby-poju-zabludowicz"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Protest"], "article": "     Protests against the Israeli offensive in Gaza became heated last night when up to 5,000 people gathered outside the country&apos;s London embassy. A crowd dominated by young British Muslims cheered as Israeli flags were burned and some protesters hurled missiles, including a firework, at police. Officers sealed off roads around Kensington High Street and armed themselves with riot shields as a small number of angry protesters tried to break down barriers protecting the building.  Older members of the crowd were seen trying to calm the atmosphere, which became increasingly charged as darkness fell and news of the ground invasion began to spread. The group had broken away from a much larger demonstration earlier in the day when thousands marched through the streets of central London and gathered at a rally in Trafalgar Square.  Police said that 12,000 people had taken part in the protest, but the Stop The War Coalition, organisers of the demonstration, said the real figure was six times that at more than 60,000. Organisers were preparing to make an official complaint to Scotland Yard after claiming that riot police charged into protesters.  Eyewitnesses claimed a number of people, including children, were thrown to the ground during a clash in an underpass at Hyde Park at the end of the demonstration.  Chris Nineham, an official of STWC who has organised dozens of national demonstrations, said: &quot;I have never seen policing as irresponsible as this. People were being crushed inside that tunnel and they were being batoned. It was absolute pandemonium and people were falling over from the force of the police attacks.  &quot;There were people trying to pull their children back and prevent them from being crushed. If anyone had fallen over then it would have been a very, very different story.&quot; Stephen Hodgkins, 38, a community worker from Battersea, said people were petrified inside the tunnel. &quot;We tried sitting down but that didn&apos;t seem to work. It was complete panic.&quot; The mood had been more optimistic earlier in the day when speakers addressed the crowds in Trafalgar Square.  &quot;Look at them, it warms my heart,&quot; said Tony Benn, president of the STWC, indicating the mass of demonstrators. Earlier, protesters had thrown more than 1,000 pairs of shoes at the heavily-policed entrance to Downing Street in a mark of solidarity with the Iraqi journalist jailed for making a similar demonstration against US President George W Bush at a press conference. The London protest was one of 18 that took place across the UK yesterday. There were also rallies in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Athens and several Asian cities. The protest march at the Israeli embassy in Athens turned violent as demonstrators threw stones and fire bombs at riot police, and officers retaliated with tear gas and stun grenades.  Hundreds of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv&apos;s Rabin Square, with up to 10,000, largely Israeli Arabs, taking to the streets in the northern town of Sakhnin. In London too, the crowds kept pouring in, a mix of ages, colours, and creeds.  Even a group of Orthodox Jews had braved possible hostility and broken the Sabbath to join the protest alongside anti-war campaigners, Muslim groups and ordinary citizens. Housing officer Derek Perry, 60, and his sculptor friend Maria Smith, 47, from West Norwood, were nursing cups of coffee in cold hands. &quot;I just wanted to be here,&quot; said Perry. &quot;You have to make a stand,&quot; said Smith. A group of young men from Leicester were selling copies of Palestinian football strips. &quot;We&apos;re nearly sold out and we brought a good 100 or more - it&apos;s all for charity,&quot; said a delighted Irshad Patel, 23, bartering furiously. The podium around Nelson&apos;s Column had been barricaded off and speakers lined up to make an address. Peace campaigner Bianca Jagger looked down towards Parliament. &quot;I made my speech too soon; I should have waited for them to arrive,&quot; she said. Singer Annie Lennox was there too. Formerly married to an Israeli, she told the Observer: &quot;This is not about political sides any more, this is a sincere and earnest yearning for peace. One and a half million people are trapped inside Gaza; what will the outcome be of a ground war? The world will never be safe again.&quot; Others found the protest upsetting. Rabbi Dr Sidney Brichto, senior vice-president of Liberal Judaism, a federation of liberal synagogues, said: &quot;The demonstration was easy to organise because most of the demonstrators want more than a ceasefire.  &quot;Most of these people want the end of Israel. Hamas are able to plug into latent anti-semitism in the West.

From the preserved remains of tanks on the winding road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to the genocide memorial at Yad Vashem and the ancient fortifications at Masada, a memory of the long history of Jewish exile and persecution and the short history of the Jewish state is deemed a necessary compass to its culture, identity and nationhood. Not to remember - for a state conceived as being Jewish in character, rather than defined by its boundaries - is to risk self-annihilation. But cultures attached so strongly to the past have difficulties not only in negotiating their relationship to the challenges of the present, but also in charting the possibilities of the future. They are resistant to change, delineated by ideas of what they once were, not what they could be. It is doubly true of young countries, even those populated by people with an ancient culture. For young states require an instant, powerful history to bind them. That insists on a gulf between themselves and the other. Last week, while Gazans under Israel&apos;s assault were living in a horrible present, some of Israel&apos;s most prominent commentators were again worrying about the past. For historian Benny Morris, writing in the International Herald Tribune, the issue was to make common cause with the days of 1967 - before the Six-Day War - a time of huge national anxiety, and to mourn the fading from history in the west of the Holocaust. It is becoming, he argued, &quot;an ineffectual memory&quot;. That is to say, less effective as a tool for public diplomacy in explaining Israel&apos;s claimed exception: why the Jewish people&apos;s history of facing extermination in a hostile world should exempt them from some of the standards for human rights and international law. Yesterday, as Israeli troops and armour invaded Gaza, it was painfully apparent, once again, that one of Israel&apos;s most acute problems is precisely the way its past weighs upon - and informs - its future. Once, the business of Israel, with Arab enemies on every border, was survival, to which all its long-term strategies were aimed. Today, its battles are largely elective, conceived for short-term advantages, to satisfy the internal conflicts and dynamics of Israeli society as much as to meet military strategic aims. Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 and the war in Lebanon in 2006 were conceived as punishments for threats (an increase in suicide bombings and Hezbollah&apos;s missiles) that, while locally dangerous, posed no existential threat. The same could be said of both Israel&apos;s attack on an alleged nuclear facility in Syria and the threat posed by Iran. The perceived Iranian menace - although keenly felt by most Israelis - may be much less dangerous than it appears. It is probably more to be feared for the limitations on Israeli action that a nuclear-armed Tehran may represent than the threat of reciprocal destruction. Most telling has been Israel&apos;s war against Gaza, long threatened and long planned, designed to topple Hamas, a group that has managed to inflict only some two dozen fatalities on Israel in the past seven years. The sphere in which these campaigns have played has been largely social-political. It serves to reassure Israelis that their country and their politicians remain, despite the increase in those avoiding military service and the decline in the operational capabilities of their armed forces, the sort of men and women who existed in its &quot;heroic&quot; era: David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, warrior-politicians and politician-warriors.  Israel&apos;s victories on the battlefield in 1948, 1967 and 1973 founded a doctrine of overwhelming military superiority it has yet to alter, despite the reverses in both wars in Lebanon, peace treaties and the changing geopolitics of the region, not least the rise of Iran.  In this, the most militarised of comparable democracies, Israel&apos;s current generation of politicians has fallen into a trap. They confuse - sometimes deliberately - the experiences of an earlier generation that lived under threat of being swept away with their own, largely voluntary, use of violence. They bolster their standing while achieving little in terms of &quot;security&quot;.  It is not only a nostalgia for its strength of arms, an insistence on only military solutions to what are essentially political problems, that lingers. Israel&apos;s history of domination and negation of the Palestinian people through occupation, civil administration and settlement has left it with a secondary historic burden: the ingrained idea that its relationship with Palestinians, and any future Palestinian state, should be defined largely on Israel&apos;s terms alone, an outlook that, like Hamas&apos;s rocket-backed rejectionism, offers no solutions, only more horror. Unable to defeat or negotiate with Hamas, the only outcome can be bloody and stalled.  That should hardly be surprising. After the second Lebanese war, Hezbollah has rearmed. The West Bank leadership under Mahmoud Abbas, as a result of Israel&apos;s incursions and interventions, is a lame duck that speaks only for one section of Palestinian society. Now Israel is hated even more in the Arab world, its actions a radicalising factor against the governments that were friendly towards it. And, as Morris noted, public opinion in the west - which in democracies ultimately informs their governments - is turning against Israel.  It is wrong to blame Israel entirely. Some culpability must also attach to the friends and allies who have so long supported it in a conception of itself so out of step with the post-colonial era, not least the United States, whose outgoing president George W Bush once again supplied Israel with a free pass yesterday by attaching responsibility over what has happened in Gaza entirely to Hamas. In some respects, Israel is suffering the same malaise that afflicted Britain in the aftermath of the Second World War. Then, by virtue of being on the winning side, it took this country decades to come to terms with the fact that in reality it was a military, colonial and economic power in decline. It is a process Israel must also confront - to recognise its painful and difficult history is not a perpetual guarantee of sympathy and a free hand to act as brutally as it wishes. \u2022 Peter Beaumont is the Observer&apos;s foreign affairs editor and author of the forthcoming The Secret Life of War: Journeys Through Conflict (Harvill Secker)", "publicationDate": "2009-01-04T00:01:00Z", "title": "Peter Beaumont: Again Israel looks to its military past", "sentences": ["From the preserved remains of tanks on the winding road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to the genocide memorial at Yad Vashem and the ancient fortifications at Masada, a memory of the long history of Jewish exile and persecution and the short history of the Jewish state is deemed a necessary compass to its culture, identity and nationhood."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/04/israel-history-comment-peter-beaumont"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas"], "article": "It is a war on two fronts. Months ago, as Israel prepared to unleash its latest wave of desolation against Gaza, it recognised that blasting Hamas and &quot;the infrastructure of terror&quot;, which includes police stations, homes and mosques, was a straightforward task. Israel also understood that a parallel operation would be required to persuade the rest of the world of the justice of its cause, even as the bodies of Palestinian women and children filled the mortuaries, and to ensure that its war was seen not in terms of occupation but of the west&apos;s struggle against terror and confrontation with Iran. After the debacle of its 2006 invasion of Lebanon - not only a military disaster for Israel, but also a political and diplomatic one - the government in Jerusalem spent months laying the groundwork at home and abroad for the assault on Gaza with quiet but energetic lobbying of foreign administrations and diplomats, particularly in Europe and parts of the Arab world. A new information directorate was established to influence the media, with some success. And when the attack began just over a week ago, a tide of diplomats, lobby groups, bloggers and other supporters of Israel were unleashed to hammer home a handful of carefully crafted core messages intended to ensure that Israel was seen as the victim, even as its bombardment killed more than 430 Palestinians over the past week, at least a third of them civilians or policemen. The unrelenting attack on Gaza, with an air strike every 20 minutes on average, has not stopped Hamas firing rockets that have killed four Israelis since the assault began, reaching deeper into the Jewish state than ever before and sending tens of thousands of people fleeing. Last night Israel escalated its action further, as its troops poured across Gaza&apos;s border, part of what appeared to be a significant ground invasion. And a diplomatic operation is already in full swing to justify the further cost in innocent lives that would almost certainly result.  Dan Gillerman, Israel&apos;s ambassador to the UN until a few months ago, was brought in by the Foreign Ministry to help lead the diplomatic and PR campaign. He said that the diplomatic and political groundwork has been under way for months. &quot;This was something that was planned long ahead,&quot; he said. &quot;I was recruited by the foreign minister to coordinate Israel&apos;s efforts and I have never seen all parts of a very complex machinery - whether it is the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, the prime minister&apos;s office, the police or the army - work in such co-ordination, being effective in sending out the message.&quot;  In briefings in Jerusalem and London, Brussels and New York, the same core messages were repeated: that Israel had no choice but to attack in response to the barrage of Hamas rockets; that the coming attack would be on &quot;the infrastructure of terror&quot; in Gaza and the targets principally Hamas fighters; that civilians would die, but it was because Hamas hides its fighters and weapons factories among ordinary people. Hand in hand went a strategy to remove the issue of occupation from discussion. Gaza was freed in 2005 when the Jewish settlers and army were pulled out, the Israelis said. It could have flourished as the basis of a Palestinian state, but its inhabitants chose conflict.  Israel portrayed Hamas as part of an axis of Islamist fundamentalist evil with Iran and Hezbollah. Its actions, the Israelis said, are nothing to do with continued occupation of the West Bank, the blockade of Gaza or the Israeli military&apos;s continued killing of large numbers of Palestinians since the pullout. &quot;Israel is part of the free world and fights extremism and terrorism. Hamas is not,&quot; the foreign minister and Kadima party leader, Tzipi Livni, said on arriving in France as part of the diplomatic offensive last week. Earlier in the week Livni deployed the &quot;with us or against us&quot; rhetoric of George W Bush&apos;s war on terror. &quot;These are the days when every individual in the region and in the world has to choose a side. And the sides have changed. No longer is it Israel on one side and the Arab world on the other,&quot; she said. &quot;Israel chose its side the day it was established; the Jewish people chose its side during its thousands of years of existence; and the prayer for peace is the voice sounded in the synagogues.&quot; It was a message pumped home with receptive Arab governments, such as Egypt and Jordan, which view Hamas with hostility. &quot;Large parts of the Muslim and Arab world realise that Hamas represents a greater danger to them even than it does to Israel. Its extremism, its fundamentalism, is a great danger to them as well,&quot; said Gillerman. &quot;We&apos;ve seen the effect of that in numerous responses, in the public statements made by [Egypt&apos;s] President Mubarak and even by [Palestinian president] Mahmoud Abbas and other Arabs. This is totally unprecedented.&quot;  Indeed, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said his government knew exactly what was coming: &quot;The signs that Israel was determined to strike Hamas in Gaza for the past three months were clear. They practically wrote it in the sky. Unfortunately they [Hamas] served Israel the opportunity on a golden platter.&quot;  Also crucial was what was not said. Just a few months ago Livni was talking of wiping out Hamas, but that would be unpalatable to much of the outside world as a justification for the assault. So now the talk is of pressing Gaza&apos;s government to agree to a new ceasefire. Occasionally someone has got off-message. A couple of days into the assault on Gaza, Israel&apos;s ambassador to the UN, Gabriela Shalev, said it would continue for &quot;as long as it takes to dismantle Hamas completely&quot;. Infuriated Israeli officials in Jerusalem warned her that such statements could set back the diplomatic offensive. In the first hours of the attack, Israel repeated the same messages to the wider world. Livni and the Labour defence minister, Ehud Barak, were widely quoted on international TV. The government&apos;s national information directorate sought to focus foreign media attention on the 8,500 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel over the past eight years and the 20 civilians they have killed, rather than the punishing blockade of Gaza and the 1,700 Palestinians killed in Israeli military attacks since Jewish settlers were pulled out of Gaza three years ago.  Lobby groups, such as the British Israel Communications and Research Centre (Bicom) in London and the Israel Project in America, were mobilised. They arranged briefings, conference calls and interviews. The Israeli military posted video footage on YouTube. Israeli diplomats in New York arranged a two-hour &quot;citizens&apos; press conference&quot; on Twitter for thousands of people. At the same time, Israel in effect barred foreign journalists from witnessing the results of its strategy.  Livni has suggested that Israel&apos;s assault is good for the Palestinians by helping to free them from the grip of Hamas. &quot;She&apos;s basically trying to convince me that they&apos;re doing this for my own good,&quot; said Diana Buttu, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation&apos;s legal counsel and negotiator with the Israelis over the 2005 pullout from Gaza. &quot;I&apos;ve had some Israeli friends reiterate the same thing: &apos;You should be happy that we&apos;re rooting out Hamas. They&apos;re a problem for you, too.&apos; I don&apos;t need her to tell me what&apos;s good for me and what&apos;s bad for me, and I don&apos;t think carrying out a massacre is good for anybody.&quot;  And when the killing started, Israel claimed that the overwhelming majority of the 400-plus killed were Hamas fighters and the buildings destroyed part of the infrastructure of terror. But about a third of the dead were policemen. Although the police force in Gaza is run by Hamas, Buttu said Israel is misrepresenting it as a terrorist organisation. &quot;The police force is largely used for internal law and order, traffic, the drug trade. They weren&apos;t fighters. They hit them at a graduation ceremony. Israel wants to kill anyone associated with Hamas, but where does it stop? Are you a legitimate target if you work in the civil service? Are you a legitimate target if you voted for Hamas?&quot; she said.  Similarly, while Israel accuses Hamas of risking civilian lives by hiding the infrastructure of terror in ordinary neighbourhoods, many of the Israeli missile targets are police stations and other public buildings that are unlikely to be built anywhere else. Israel argues that Hamas abandoned the June ceasefire that Jerusalem was prepared to continue. &quot;Israel is the first one who wants the violence to end. We were not looking for this. There was no other option. The truce was violated by Hamas,&quot; said Livni.  However, others say that the truce was thrown into jeopardy in November when the Israeli military killed six Hamas gunmen in a raid on Gaza. The Palestinians noted that it was election day in the US, so most of the rest of the world did not notice what happened. Hamas responded by firing a wave of rockets into Israel. Six more Palestinians died in two other Israeli attacks in the following week.  &quot;They were assaulting Gaza militarily, by sea and by air, all through the ceasefire,&quot; said Buttu. Neither did the killing of Palestinians stop. In the nearly three years since Hamas came to power, and before the latest assault on Gaza, Israel forces had killed about 1,300 people in Gaza and the West Bank. While a significant number of them were Hamas activists - and while hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians in fighting between Hamas and Fatah - there has been a disturbing number of civilian deaths.  The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights says that one in four of the victims is aged under 18. Between June 2007 and June 2008, Israeli attacks killed 68 Palestinian children and young people in Gaza. Another dozen were killed in the West Bank.  In February, an Israeli missile killed four boys, aged eight to 14, playing football in the street in Jabalia. In April, Meyasar Abu-Me&apos;tiq and her four children, aged one to five years old, were killed when an Israeli missile hit their house as they were having breakfast. Even during the ceasefire, Israel killed 22 people in Gaza, including two children and a woman.  Perhaps crucial to the ceasefire&apos;s collapse were the differing views of what it was supposed to achieve. Israel regarded the truce as calm in return for calm. Hamas expected Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza that the latter said was a security response to the firing of Qassam rockets. But Israel did not end the siege that was wrecking the economy and causing desperate shortages of food, fuel and medicine. Gazans concluded that the blockade was not so much about rocket attacks as punishment for voting for Hamas.  Central to the Israeli message has been that, when it pulled out its military and Jewish settlers three years ago, Gaza was offered the opportunity to prosper. &quot;In order to create a vision of hope, we took out our forces and settlements, but instead of Gaza being the beginning of a Palestinian state, Hamas established an extreme Islamic rule,&quot; said Livni. Israeli officials argue that Hamas, and by extension the people who elected it, was more interested in hating and killing Jews than building a country.  Palestinians see it differently. Buttu says that from the day the Israelis withdrew from Gaza, they set about ensuring that it would fail economically. &quot;When the Israelis pulled out, we expected that the Palestinians in Gaza would at least be able to lead some sort of free life. We expected that the crossing points would be open. We didn&apos;t expect that we would have to beg to allow food in,&quot; she said.  Buttu notes that even before Hamas was elected three years ago, the Israelis were already blockading Gaza. The Palestinians had to appeal to US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, to pressure Israel to allow even a few score of trucks into Gaza each day. Israel agreed, then reneged. &quot;This was before Hamas won the election. The whole Israeli claim is one big myth. If there wasn&apos;t already a closure policy, why did we need Rice and Wolfensohn to try to broker an agreement?&quot; asked Buttu. Yossi Alpher, a former official in the Mossad intelligence service and an ex-adviser on peace negotiations to the then prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the blockade of Gaza is a failed strategy that might have strengthened Hamas. &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone can produce clear evidence that the blockade has been counterproductive, but it certainly hasn&apos;t been productive. It&apos;s very possible it&apos;s been counterproductive. It&apos;s collective punishment, humanitarian suffering. It has not caused Palestinians in Gaza to behave the way we want them to, so why do it?&quot; he said. &quot;I think people really believed that, if you starved Gazans, they will get Hamas to stop the attacks. It&apos;s repeating a failed policy, mindlessly.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Monday 5 January 2009.

Nonetheless, the EU is preparing to upgrade its existing agreement to give Israel even more privileged access to European institutions.  In December, the council of ministers voted to support this upgrade, ignoring the fact that Israel was in breach of an &quot;essential element&quot; of the earlier agreement. This required states to respect &quot;human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this agreement&quot;. The proposed upgrade is even weaker and includes no obligations on Israel in respect of its illegal settlements, the illegal wall, and its repeated breaches of international human rights and international humanitarian law. In view of the horrific events of the past days, we call on: 1) The UK government to revoke its support for any new agreements with Israel and for this to be communicated forthwith to the Czech presidency of the EU in advance of its meeting with the commission, and to the EU council of ministers 2) The European parliament to refuse to endorse any extension of existing agreements and to use its influence to prevent any upgrades of EU benefits to Israel until it abides by its international legal and humanitarian obligations.

Signs have begun to emerge of the shape of a potential deal on a truce and new border arrangements, though analysts said these were still unlikely to be agreed quickly. Sarkozy flew to Israel after a meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, about the Gaza crisis. After talks in the West Bank town of Ramallah, the French leader said he would tell Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, that &quot;violence must stop&quot;. &quot;We in Europe want a ceasefire as quickly as possible, and that everyone understands that time is running against peace,&quot; Sarkozy said. &quot;The guns must fall silent, there must be a humanitarian truce. Everyone must understand that what is at stake here is not just an issue of Israel and Palestinians, it is a global issue and it is the whole world which will help you find a solution.&quot; Egypt also invited a delegation from Hamas, the Islamist movement fighting Israel, to visit Cairo. Such a visitwould be Hamas&apos;s first contact with a key regional player since fighting began 10 days ago. Sarkozy will tomorrow go on to Syria, Hamas&apos;s main Arab supporter. In other signs of frantic activity, diplomats said Turkey was playing a significant role behind the scenes. Ankara has already publicly offered to convey any Hamas ceasefire proposal to the UN. It is understood senior Turkish officials met the leaders of Hamas and the smaller, more militant Islamic Jihad faction in Damascus last week. Both are boycotted as terrorists by all western countries. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, is trusted by Hamas because of his Islamist credentials. &quot;The Turks have been talking to all the right people,&quot; said one diplomat based in the region. &quot;They are seen as a neutral broker. They are professional and sincere.&quot; Underlining the role played by Turkey, Syria sent its foreign minister, Walid al-Mualim, to Ankara today. &quot;I came to discuss ways to bring about an immediate ceasefire, a removal of the [Israeli] blockade and the opening of all crossings, as well as finding a mechanism to achieve these goals,&quot; he said after talks with Ali Babacan, his Turkish counterpart. In a further development, the UN&apos;s special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process, Robert Serry, was summoned to New York where Arab countries were drafting a security council resolution demanding an immediate end to &quot;Israeli aggression&quot; in Gaza. With UN forces already deployed on Israel&apos;s borders with Syria and Lebanon, one possibility being mooted is creating a new one for the border between Gaza and Egypt. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, is flying to New York tomorrow to take part in the UN debate on the crisis. &quot;If Sarkozy has something that can pass the security council then the pressure may start on both sides,&quot; Ali Jarbawi, a professor of political science at Birzeit University, told the bitterlemons.org website. But there are signs that hard bargaining lies ahead. Israel wants its offensive to end with an agreement imposed on Gaza by the international community rather than a new ceasefire directly with Hamas. &quot;We don&apos;t sign agreements with terror,&quot; Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister, insisted after meeting an EU delegation yesterday. &quot;We fight terror.&quot; Israel wants Egypt to prevent smuggling into Gaza from its border and its crossings into the territory operating under international supervision. It insists on the presence of the Palestinian Authority (PA), run by Abbas&apos;s West Bank-based Fatah movement, Hamas&apos; bitter rival. &quot;The international community will initiate the agreements and impose it on Hamas,&quot; the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper quoted a senior political source in Jerusalem as saying. &quot;The agreements will be with both the PA and Egypt and then if Hamas will not agree it will pay the price, mostly by even greater isolation.&quot; Israel has suggested the US might help Egypt by sending combat engineers to reinforce the border. As well as EU and PA officials deployed at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, as in the past, it also wants US, French and Arab support for a UN-backed resolution granting Israel the right to respond to any Hamas violations. Above all, it wants to avoid a situation under which Hamas could rearm after a ceasefire, as Lebanon&apos;s Hezbullah was able to do soon after the end of the 2006 war. Under a 2005 agreement, Rafah can only be opened to normal traffic if EU observers and PA forces are at the border, which is also monitored by Israel. But the PA presence ended when Hamas took over Gaza from Fatah in June 2007. The challenge now will be to find a way to allow them back at a time that relations between the two factions are at a nadir. Western diplomats said the US, EU and Arab League were now looking at a four-point agenda: \u2022 Stopping arms smuggling into Gaza \u2022 Financial support for Egypt in controlling the border and detecting tunnels \u2022 International monitoring, with the UN, EU and Arab forces assisting Egypt \u2022 Reopening of all crossing points into the Gaza Strip - a key Hamas demand. Further signs of a mounting international backlash against Israel came with an unusally strong condemnation from Saudi Arabia. &quot;The international position is feeble in dealing with unprecedented Israeli violations,&quot; said a cabinet statement. &quot;To say that Israeli barbarity is self-defence is to close one&apos;s eyes to the history of Israeli occupation and settlement of Palestinian territories, practices of closure and terror, and the massive imbalance in power between the two sides,&quot; it said. Mauritania said it was recalling its ambassador to Tel Aviv for consultations. Egypt and Jordan, the only two other Arab countries which have peace treaties with Israel, have strongly condemned the Gaza offensive.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-05T19:52:42Z", "title": "Sarkozy leads mounting international pressure on Israel to halt Gaza bloodshed", "sentences": ["Mauritania said it was recalling its ambassador to Tel Aviv for consultations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/05/sarkozy-gaza-israel-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["US news", "Education", "School admissions", "World news"], "article": "Rachel has never received a violation from the federal aviation administration during her flying career. Rachel must be a great pilot. Which of the following can be said about the reasoning above?A) The definition of the terms creates ambiguityB) The argument uses circular reasoningC) The argument uses analogyD) The argument is built upon hidden assumptionsE) Is this test really going to show you anything other than the fact I have enough money and/or self-hatred to spend months cramming for a test that indicates nothing other than my wealth and/or self-hating ambition? The above question is from the LSat (I made up one of the options), a three-and-a-half-hour standardised test required for all applicants to American law schools, intended to gauge analytical skills, logical reasoning and reading comprehension. In the law school admission process, the LSat is considered to be of equal weight to your entire undergraduate career \u2013 which seems particularly cruel to American students, whose graduating mark or GPA is a cumulative score where every essay and course they take counts toward their final grade, which is hardly the doss around for three years then cram for eight final exams education I received in the UK. Officially, your undergraduate score, personal essays, references and LSat score will all determine whether or not you&apos;re admitted into a law programme, but some prestigious universities reportedly use the LSat as a one-glance mechanism for determining whether to even spend time reading an application. Yet the problems with the LSat are more numerous than the number of options on a standardised test sheet. Not only is it widely considered to be a poor predictor of success, as well as potentially ethnocentric, it increasingly produces a result that the richest students can buy with thousand-dollar tuition programmes, fuelling a billion-dollar test-preparation industry that has no interest in the common good of education. I had to take the test in Tel Aviv earlier this month because it was the closest test centre to my country of residence (test-takers can request a non-listed test site if their country doesn&apos;t provide an LSat, but the fees are so exorbitant it&apos;s probably cheaper to cross a border to the nearest listed centre). In an unpleasant introduction to the famous lack of social cohesion of graduate school, at the test site young NGO workers based in Palestine made uneasy small-talk with Ivy League-educated alpha-males, all pink polo shirts and preppy hairstyles, who flew in from America on business. As I overhead two of them discussing whether, statistically speaking, option D was the correct answer 1% more often than any other letter, I wondered whether I&apos;d ever be ambitious, rich, obsessive-compulsive or pink-polo-shirted enough to fit in at law school, even if I did get through the next three-and-a-half hours of logic &quot;games&quot;. The exam itself wasn&apos;t too bad \u2013 although I don&apos;t get my results until next week, and unlike essay exams, it&apos;s difficult to guess your score accurately (having to sit in the exam room for that long seems more of a test of how well your bladder can hold up than anything else). But what&apos;s most depressing is that a good score probably means nothing about a person&apos;s actual intelligence, other than their ability to learn a certain test format. A 2005 Canadian report (pdf) claimed that although &quot;the reliability of the LSat has been questioned on numerous occasions, it still is heavily weighted by law schools, who claim it tests law-school required skills&quot;. But law school professors admit that law students will not be asked to answer the same number of questions under the strict time constraints of the LSat, with its back-to-back sections of 35 minutes for every 24-28 questions. Earlier this year the dean of UC-Berkeley&apos;s law school sought support for national research on LSat alternatives that measure characteristics central to success as a lawyer, such as negotiating skills and stress management. But an alternative to the LSat wouldn&apos;t just benefit all good potential lawyers who mess up the day of the LSat. It would primarily help ethnic minorities and students from poor backgrounds \u2013 socio-economic groups for whom American universities talk a lot of talk, but deliver few results. A 1998 study showed a significant LSat score difference between minority and white students from the same universities with identical GPAs, indicating that this is either because minority students are more likely to be from low-income backgrounds and cannot afford expensive test-preparation materials, or that the test itself is ethnocentric and favours the knowledge (pdf) of students from certain types of backgrounds. Even without these problems in reality, the very concept that the LSat gauges some kind of innate aptitude for logic and analytical reasoning seems bogus. Aside from the larger question of whether test-assessed knowledge can ever really be innate, the basic fact is that test-preparation companies guaranteeing higher scores &quot;or your money back&quot; would not be booming if the notion that you can&apos;t prepare for the LSat was in any way true. But despite all the problems with the test&apos;s reliability as a performance predictor, more than a few have a vested interest in law school admissions&apos; continued emphasis on the LSat. Companies such as Kaplan - owned by the Washington Post company - and The Princeton Review aggressively advertise their courses on most US and Canadian campuses, offering classes and private tuition for sums that can enter several thousand dollars. Making several billion dollars a year, Kaplan has a near-monopoly on this market, and the company recently settled out of court on accusations of anti-trust collusion with competitors between 1997 and 2006. As a student writer at The Cornell Daily Sun recently wrote: &quot;With no scholarships available for a test prep course and no financial aid, it&apos;s basically so that those who can afford it get a &apos;leg up&apos; over those who have earmarked their pennies to pay for pasta. Is this the modern day version of daddy pulling out his chequebook to get you into college?&quot; The test-preparation industry locks the LSat into a negative cycle: The more successful Kaplan is, the more students will likely feel the need to take test-preparation classes in order to compete with their peers, leaving those who simply can&apos;t afford them in an even worse position. And yet little of this seems to register in the public attitude to the LSat. In Legally Blonde, heroine Elle Woods crams for the exam in a single, upbeat montage. The obsession with finding out Barack Obama&apos;s LSat score can be added to list of internet-driven nut-job conspiracies that the president-elect has faked everything from his birth certificate to his law degree. Perhaps more interesting is the recent blogosphere griping that writer Elizabeth Wurtzel didn&apos;t deserve her place at Yale Law because her LSat score was below average for the school. Given that Wurtzel, for all her faults, is a bestselling author and award-winning journalist, it seems odd that people think Yale should have judged her for her LSat \u2013 a supposed indicator of success \u2013 more than, well, her actual success. Such is the problem with the standardised tests. As long as they continue to matter to other people, you have to play the game too. There&apos;s little to gain from fighting against them \u2013 or refusing to study for them \u2013 when there are so many other applicants who are willing to spend thousands of dollars on test preparation. During an economic downturn such as this, applications to grad school typically rise, as recent graduates either decide to wait out the recession in academic institutions, or fear for their job prospects if they don&apos;t acquire new qualifications. American law school is also an increasingly attractive option for many British students. In the international humanitarian and NGO community for instance, an American JD is often more respected than the myriad qualifications that British students can claim qualifies them in law. And while obviously almost no one, myself included, could ever afford the fees \u2013 which for the top 20 schools can reach $150,000 there are also more funding and scholarship opportunities than in the UK, as rich alumni, charity-donation incentives and extensive investments mean American universities are far less strapped for cash than their British counterparts, at least for now. The test industry and the problems of the LSat as a predictor of success undoubtedly mean we&apos;d be better off if law schools placed less emphasis on a student&apos;s performance on the standardised test. But I&apos;m beginning to wonder whether, given its many faults and the nefarious practices it encourages, the LSat is intended primarily to teach prospective law students a valuable lesson in respect to their future career: Life&apos;s unfair, so just try to select the best out of a bunch of bad options.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-05T20:00:01Z", "title": "Heather McRobie: Why do US law schools place such an emphasis on the LSat?", "sentences": ["I had to take the test in Tel Aviv earlier this month because it was the closest test centre to my country of residence (test-takers can request a non-listed test site if their country doesn&apos;t provide an LSat, but the fees are so exorbitant it&apos;s probably cheaper to cross a border to the nearest listed centre)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jan/05/us-law-school-lsat"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "United Nations", "World news", "Refugees", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Mahmoud Khalil looked around the classroom and decided the safest place for his children was under the desks. UN officials had reassured the father of five he and his family would be protected by the large blue and white flag flying above the UN-run school turned refugee shelter. But with the sound of large explosions on the edge of Jabaliya refugee camp, just north of Gaza City, and his children still terrified from the trauma of their escape, Khalil was taking no chances.  &quot;They will kill us anywhere. If they can bomb the mosque, if they can kill small children, if they can blow up our parliament, why should they care if they bomb this school? They don&apos;t care what the United Nations thinks. They don&apos;t care what the whole world thinks,&quot; he said, when reached by telephone. The 38-year-old mechanic arranged a cluster of desks in the corner of the classroom and laid blankets on the floor under them for his children - the youngest three years old, the eldest 14 - to lie on.  &quot;God willing, that will protect them,&quot; he said. &quot;They are terrified after what they have seen. Explosions near our house. Everybody running away. The Israelis dropped leaflets and said on the radio we must all get out or they will kill us because they are going to bomb our houses.&quot; But where to flee? In other conflicts refugees move across borders or to quieter regions. But Gaza&apos;s 1.5 million residents are trapped behind the long Israeli fence, dotted with machine gun posts and watchtowers, that makes their home a prison. There is no way out.  So Khalil and his children, like thousands of other Gazans, settled for what they could find - schools run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency that have flung their doors open as shelters from the Israeli assault that is claiming more lives by the hour. By last night 17 schools had been turned into shelters with more than 5,000 people seeking protection inside. Nine of the schools are in Jabaliya refugee camp on the front line of the fighting.  Adnan Abu Hasna is an official with the UN&apos;s Palestinian refugee agency who visited several of the schools yesterday. &quot;I found hundreds of people are fleeing their homes just in the Jabaliya area. There&apos;s a lot of fear, a lot of panic. You can see it with the children too,&quot; he said. &quot;We are talking about Gaza as a very tiny area. Where do they go? We are talking about very poor areas. People arrive without anything. We are providing them with mattresses, blankets and certain amounts of food. We try and give families privacy where the schools are not too crowded. But there are huge numbers coming in some areas.&quot; Besides the schools in Jabaliya, three others have been turned into shelters in Gaza City, one in Rafah, in the south of the strip, and a handful of others scattered around. But Hasna says there will be more, although he is only marginally more confident than Khalil that the UN flag will provide protection.  &quot;We depend on it being a UN installation with a big flag. We hope the Israelis will respect that. We are contacting them and telling them,&quot; he said. Israel&apos;s foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, is trying to persuade the world that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. UN officials scoff at the claim, noting that 1 million people are living without electricity and 250,000 without running water. And then there are the bombs and rockets, terror and trauma.  Khalil has given this some thought. &quot;When Hamas fires rockets into Israel, the Israelis say they are scared and run away,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not saying Hamas is right or wrong. But I believe the Israeli people are scared because the rocket can hurt them or their children. So they run away to Tel Aviv where they have food and electricity and they are safe and Israel says that is a humanitarian crisis. But we who are trapped here with no electricity and water and our children hearing bombs and screaming and holding each other, they say this is not a humanitarian crisis.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-06T00:01:00Z", "title": "Besieged families flee homes for shelter under UN flag", "sentences": ["So they run away to Tel Aviv where they have food and electricity and they are safe and Israel says that is a humanitarian crisis."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/06/gaza-palestine-israel"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Syria", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "France", "European Union", "Lebanon", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas", "Bashar al-Assad", "Europe"], "article": "Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, today flew to Syria to urge President Bashar al-Assad to pressure Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza, as the fighting with Israel entered its 11th day. &quot;I know the importance of Syria in this region and its influence on a number of players,&quot; Sarkozy said in Damascus. &quot;I don&apos;t have any doubt that President Bashar al-Assad will throw all his weight to convince everyone to return to reason.&quot; Assad condemned the Gaza offensive. &quot;We have to immediately stop the barbaric Israeli aggression in Gaza,&quot; he said at a joint press conference with Sarkozy. &quot;Thirty percent of the victims are children under the age of 10, and Gaza is now a concentration camp.&quot; Sarkozy went on to the Lebanese capital, Beirut, where the Shia movement Hizbullah, backed by Iran, has been expressing solidarity with Hamas, but appears unlikely to launch a second front against Israel. The French president&apos;s visits followed talks in Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian West Bank, where he underlined the EU&apos;s urgent insistence on an immediate ceasefire. In another development, a Hamas delegation flew from Damascus to Cairo for talks on the crisis. Its officials were meeting General Omar Suleiman, the Egyptian intelligence chief, who has brokered previous ceasefires in Gaza and tried to bring about reconciliation between Hamas and its Fatah rival. Egyptian officials were tight-lipped about the talks, saying any public exposure could damage a highly delicate negotiation. The meeting will be Hamas&apos;s first contact with a key regional player since fighting began on 27 December. In Israel, the government made clear that preventing a new Hamas arms buildup was the &quot;necessary foundation&quot; of any new truce. &quot;That is the make-or-break issue,&quot; insisted Mark Regev, spokesman for the prime minister, Ehud Olmert. &quot;Under no circumstances will we agree to a new calm that will allow them [Hamas] to increase their range to 60km so we have rockets falling on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.&quot; Diplomats said Turkey was playing a significant role behind the scenes.

David Miliband, Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, flew to New York to take part in the UN debate on the crisis. &quot;If Sarkozy has something that can pass the security council then the pressure may start on both sides,&quot; Ali Jarbawi, a professor of political science at Birzeit University, told the bitterlemons.org website. Signs have begun to emerge of the shape of a potential deal on a truce and new border arrangements, though analysts said these were still unlikely to be agreed quickly. But hard bargaining lies ahead. Israel wants its offensive to end with an agreement imposed on Gaza by the international community rather than a new ceasefire directly with Hamas. &quot;We don&apos;t sign agreements with terror,&quot; Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister, insisted after meeting an EU delegation yesterday. &quot;We fight terror.&quot; Israel wants Egypt to prevent smuggling into Gaza from its border and its crossings into the territory operating under international supervision. It insists on the presence of the Palestinian Authority (PA), run by Abbas&apos;s West Bank-based Fatah movement. &quot;The international community will initiate the agreements and impose it on Hamas,&quot; the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper quoted a senior political source in Jerusalem as saying. &quot;The agreements will be with both the PA and Egypt and then if Hamas will not agree it will pay the price, mostly by even greater isolation.&quot; Israel has suggested the US might help Egypt by sending combat engineers to reinforce the border. As well as EU and PA officials deployed at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, as in the past, it also wants US, French and Arab support for a UN-backed resolution granting Israel the right to respond to any Hamas violations. Under a 2005 agreement, Rafah can only be opened to normal traffic if EU observers and PA forces are at the border, which is also monitored by Israel. But the PA presence ended when Hamas took over Gaza from Fatah in June 2007. The challenge now will be to find a way to allow them back at a time that relations between the two factions are at a nadir. Western diplomats said the US, EU and Arab League were now looking at a four-point agenda: stopping arms smuggling into Gaza; financial support for Egypt in controlling the border and detecting tunnels; international monitoring, with the UN, EU and Arab forces assisting Egypt; and the reopening of all crossing points into the Gaza Strip \u2013 a key Hamas demand.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-06T13:41:34Z", "title": "Sarkozy urges Syria leader Assad to press Hamas for Gaza truce", "sentences": ["&quot;Under no circumstances will we agree to a new calm that will allow them [Hamas] to increase their range to 60km so we have rockets falling on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.&quot; Diplomats said Turkey was playing a significant role behind the scenes."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/06/gaza-sarkozy-syria-assad"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Media", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Shortly after Israel&apos;s air raids on Gaza began, one protester appeared on Army Radio to explain his dissent. In a manner eerily evocative of US TV bully Bill O&apos;Reilly laying into an especially poignant opponent to the war on terror, the Israeli demonstrator was dismissed, marginalised and practically shouted down.  This is how media is during the first weeks of war: all patriotic flag-waving, morale-boosting and blatant scorn for any objections from the peaceniks. It happens everywhere \u2013 remember the media during the American war on terror and the two Gulf wars. Israel is no exception: the surmising phrase is, &quot;Silence! They&apos;re shooting!&quot; In other words, it&apos;s expected that everyone, media included, should save the opposition and criticisms for the postwar period.  In the first week of the pounding air attacks on Gaza, Israel&apos;s mainstream media, which has almost complete saturation among a news-hungry public, was concentrating on the impact of rocket attacks from Gaza on Israel. The southern population, increasing numbers of whom are now within rocket range, are increasingly interviewed; ruptures to normal life are discussed at length while near-hits are carefully examined and solidarity messages pour forth in a wave of media empathy. The headlines and screen tickers predominantly inform of the situation on the home front.  &quot;Journalists see themselves more like patriotic citizens than professionals in the early stages of war \u2013 in any country,&quot; says Professor Gabriel Weimann, communications expert at Haifa University, who has researched the subject across several wars and continents. It is only after the event that a nation&apos;s mainstream media is capable of critiquing its own war-time reporting. &quot;After the war,&quot; says Weimann, &quot;journalists wake up with a huge professional hangover and say, &apos;We were fooled and manipulated.&apos;&quot; That&apos;s what happened to embedded journalists during the second Gulf war and to Israeli journalists during the second Lebanon war. However, the self-awareness doesn&apos;t prevent popular media from making the same mistakes all over again come the next conflict.  Time and events can dictate whether or not national media gets more professional and less personal a few weeks into a conflict. It if drags on, or if death counts are perceived to be too high, media objections start to surface. But when it comes to civilian deaths in Gaza, so far the public and the media mostly echo the Israeli government&apos;s line about these being the fault of Hamas, for using its population as human shields.  But there were a few critical voices from the onset, mostly in the print media. Gideon Levy wrote a blistering piece in Ha&apos;aretz, Israel&apos;s oldest daily newspaper, about the country&apos;s beloved air force, which is customarily considered off-limits for internal attack. Tom Segev, also in Ha&apos;aretz, pointed out some historic lessons that pro-war Israelis might want to heed. And B Michael&apos;s (Hebrew) comment piece in Yediot Aharonot, entitled &quot;Deja vu war&quot;, shooed off all the carefully orchestrated national rhetoric about the Gaza attacks being a war on terror. The assaults, he wrote, were quite simply &quot;an occupier&apos;s war waged against the occupied&quot;.  Once the Israeli ground assault on Gaza began, the media shifted apace.  On Saturday, the night of the ground invasion, Israel&apos;s Channel 10 showed a looped clip of Gaza in complete darkness while periodically taking calls describing the intense bombing from a Gazan stringer \u2013 he asked the Tel Aviv anchor if she could hear the bombing down the line and she solemnly nodded: yes.  The increased suffering of Gaza&apos;s population, now under even more terrifying bombardment, may be given an Israeli spin (aka, &quot;Whose fault is that?&quot;) \u2013 but it is not ignored. Southern residents are still dominant in the media frame: reports converge on the rockets still being fired from Gaza and the bored and school-less children in shelters, whose matriculation exams the government has thoughtfully postponed.  But now, a lot of the Israeli media focus is on the troops sent into Gaza and the tens of thousands of reserves called up to base camps. Radio spools phone-ins with anxious mums, while dads are shown on TV rushing to deliver forgotten items and a final embrace to departing soldiers.  News of one combatant, seriously injured in Gaza and now recovering in an Israel hospital, is delivered in regular bulletins on Army Radio \u2013 it&apos;s not just his health that&apos;s of interest; it&apos;s that this soldier really wants to get back to the fighting in Gaza.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-06T17:00:01Z", "title": "Rachel Shabi: The conflict in Gaza is bringing out a patriotic spin in Israel's media", "sentences": ["On Saturday, the night of the ground invasion, Israel&apos;s Channel 10 showed a looped clip of Gaza in complete darkness while periodically taking calls describing the intense bombing from a Gazan stringer \u2013 he asked the Tel Aviv anchor if she could hear the bombing down the line and she solemnly nodded: yes."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/06/israel-gaza-media"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "     The civilian death toll in Gaza increased dramatically today, with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive. Two Israeli tank shells struck the school in Jabaliya refugee camp, spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building, according to news agency reports. The medical director of the hospital in Jabaliya told the Guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way. Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes. In addition to the dead, several dozen people were wounded, hospital officials said. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. A United Nations official in Gaza said the school was clearly marked with a UN flag and its location had been reported to Israeli authorities. John Ging, director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter. &quot;Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties,&quot; he said. Asked whether there were Hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack, Ging said it was the scene of clashes &quot;so there&apos;s an intense military and militant activity in that area.&quot; He said UN staff vetted Palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them. &quot;So far we&apos;ve not had violations by militants of our facilities,&quot; he said. Ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near UN facilities. &quot;I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in,&quot; Fares Ghanem, a hospital official told the Associated Press. &quot;A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces.&quot; Majed Hamdan, an AP photographer, who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks, said many children were among the dead. &quot;I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief, screaming, some of them collapsed to the floor. They knew their children were dead,&quot; he said. &quot;In the morgue, most of the killed appeared to be children. In the hospital, there wasn&apos;t enough space for the wounded.&quot; Elsewehere, at least 12 members of an extended family, including seven young children, were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City. The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city&apos;s Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles. The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years, three women and two men. Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble. Hours earlier, three young men \u2013 all cousins \u2013 died when the Israelis bombed another UN school, the Asma primary school in Gaza City. They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. The UN, which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked, said it was &quot;strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation&quot;. &quot;Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated, those responsible must be held to account. Under international law, installations such as schools, health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack. Well before the current fighting, the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza, including Asma elementary school.&quot; The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600. Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one-fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead. Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only &quot;terrorists&quot; has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops, killing four. The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza&apos;s second largest city, Khan Younis, for the first time today, supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack. In a separate attack earlier in the day, three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra, the UN relief agency. Nine Israelis, including three civilians hit by rocket fire, have been killed in the conflict. At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today, including one that hit the town of Gadera, 17 miles from Tel Aviv, police said. A three-year-old girl was wounded. The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza, with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea. Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting. In Shajaiyeh, east of Gaza City, Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops. Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones, neighbours said. Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions. There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured, including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade, one of Israel&apos;s key fighting forces. Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, said his country&apos;s troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire. &quot;Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us, but we have yet to achieve our objective, and therefore the operation continues,&quot; Barak said. The Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel&apos;s conflict with Hamas. &quot;When Israel is targeted, Israel is going to retaliate,&quot; she said. Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire. The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt, in the south, and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas. In Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement, appeared on the party&apos;s al-Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere. &quot;The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children. They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people,&quot; Zahar said. He urged Hamas fighters to &quot;crush your enemy&quot;. Another Hamas figure, a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida, said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military, and that rocket attacks would increase. More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday, including one that landed in an empty kindergarten, which, like all schools near the Gaza border, has been closed since the conflict began.. Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting. Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza, particularly to the north, in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya. Using leaflets, telephone calls and radio announcements, they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes, forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere. At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters. The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured. It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip&apos;s sole power plant, which has been shut for a week. Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting. More wheat grain is needed for food handouts, and the UN said Karni, the main commercial crossing, should be reopened to allow it in. Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City. John Holmes, the UN emergency relief coordinator, said Gaza represented an &quot;increasingly alarming&quot; humanitarian crisis, and that the territory was running low on clean water, power, food, medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive. Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-06T19:46:00Z", "title": "Israeli shelling of Gaza kills dozens at UN school", "sentences": ["At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today, including one that hit the town of Gadera, 17 miles from Tel Aviv, police said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/06/gaza-israel-death-un"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "United Nations", "Refugees", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "      Israel&apos;s assault on Gaza has exacted the bloodiest toll of civilian lives yet, when the bombing of UN schools being used as refugee centres and of housing killed more than 50 people, including an entire family of seven young children.  The UN protested at a &quot;complete absence of accountability&quot; for the escalating number of civilian deaths in Gaza, saying &quot;the rule of the gun&quot; had taken over. Doctors in Gaza said more than 40 people died, including children, in what appears to be the biggest single loss of life of the campaign when Israeli bombs hit al-Fakhora school, in Jabaliya refugee camp, while it was packed with hundreds of people who had fled the fighting. Most of those killed were in the school playground and in the street, and the dead and injured lay in pools of blood. Pictures on Palestinian TV showed walls heavily marked by shrapnel and bloodstains, and shoes and shredded clothes scattered on the ground. Windows were blown out. Hours before, three young men who were cousins died when the Israelis bombed Asma elementary school in Gaza City. They were among 400 people who had sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza. Abed Sultan, 20, a student, and his cousins, Rawhi and Hussein Sultan, labourers aged 22, died. Abed Sultan&apos;s father, Samir, said the bodies were so mangled that he could not tell his son from the cousins. &quot;We came to the school when the Israelis warned us to leave,&quot; he said. &quot;We hoped it would be safe. We were 20 in one room. We had no electricity, no blankets, no food. &quot;Suddenly we heard a bomb that shook the school. Windows smashed. Children started to scream. A relative came and told me one of my sons was killed. I found my son&apos;s body with his two cousins. They were cut into pieces by the shell.&quot; The UN was particularly incensed over targeting of the schools, because Israeli forces knew they were packed with families as they had ordered them to get out of their homes with leaflet drops and loudspeakers. It said it had identified the schools as refugee centres to the Israeli military and provided GPS coordinates. Israel accused Hamas of using civilians as cover, and said the Islamist group could stop the assault on Gaza by ending its rocket attacks on Israel. The Palestinian authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, last night delivered an impassioned plea to the UN security council to act immediately to stop the Israeli operation, which he described as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for his people. Israel has agreed a &quot;humanitarian corridor&quot; to allow Palestinians to get essential goods. The rising casualty toll, more than 640 Palestinians killed since the assault began 12 days ago, gave fresh impetus to diplomatic efforts. The White House offered its first hint of concern at Israel&apos;s actions by calling on it to avoid civilian deaths. The president-elect, Barack Obama, broke his silence by saying he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about civilian casualties on both sides. He said he would have &quot;plenty to say&quot; about the crisis after his swearing in. Gordon Brown said the Middle East was facing its &quot;darkest moment yet&quot; but hoped a ceasefire could be arranged soon. Explaining its attack on al-Fahora school, the Israeli military claimed that a mortar was fired from the playground, and it responded with a single shell whichkilled known Hamas fighters; the resulting explosion was compounded because Hamas &quot;booby-trapped the school&quot;. Two Hamas militants were among the dead, both part of a rocket-launching cell. The head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, John Ging, said three shells landed at the perimeter of the school. &quot;It was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties,&quot; he said.  He said UN staff vetted those Palestinians who sought shelter at the school. &quot;So far we&apos;ve not had violations by militants of our facilities,&quot; he said, though responding to questions he accepted there had been clashes between Hamas and the Israeli army in the area.  Earlier in the day, Ging visited Gaza&apos;s hospital and was shocked at the scale of civilian casualties. &quot;What you have in this hospital is the consequences of political failure and the complete absence of any accountability for actions that are being taken. It&apos;s the rule of the gun now, and it has to stop,&quot; he said. At least 12 of one family, seven children aged from one to 12, three women and two men, were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City. Nine others were believed trapped. Israel continues to insist most of those killed by its forces are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters - although its assertion it is going to extraordinary lengths to target only &quot;terrorists&quot; has been undermined by a tank firing on a building used by Israeli troops, killing four of them, on Monday.  Another soldier was killed yesterday as Israeli forces continued their push into Gaza City. Tanks and troops also moved on the southern town of Khan Yunis. The invasion has yet to achieve what Israel says is its goal of stopping rocket attacks. Hamas fired more than 30 into Israel yesterday, one to within 20 miles of Tel Aviv at Gadera, wounding a baby. The de facto Hamas prime minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, issued a statement from hiding, saying that the Gazans would defeat Israel. &quot;[Israel] has failed to force the population to surrender,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-07T00:01:00Z", "title": "Gaza's day of carnage - 40 dead as Israelis bomb two UN schools", "sentences": ["Hamas fired more than 30 into Israel yesterday, one to within 20 miles of Tel Aviv at Gadera, wounding a baby."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-obama"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Media", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Forget, alas, all the usual stuff about fairness, balance and freedom of independent thought.

The Times never addressed its wisdom or unwisdom before the tanks rolled forward. A Washington Post editorial, after the event, thought invading &quot;risky&quot;.  In general, with the New York Post, the Daily News and all the usual suspects cheerleading away, there was no balance, no fairness and precious little you could call independent thought.

It matters because the press has a duty, imperfectly executed. It matters because democratic government depends on good information \u2013 and here, this time round, seekers after any broader truth (longer than a fortnight ago, that is) would do better to log on to Israeli news websites and read papers like Ha&apos;aretz that make the great grey Times seem craven.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-07T16:30:01Z", "title": "Peter Preston: The US media should speak out on the conflict in Gaza", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv seemed to bark orders: the US media just wagged its tail."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/07/gaza-america-media"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "World news", "France", "Egypt", "United Nations", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Europe", "Africa"], "article": "     Israel today gave a guarded welcome to a French and Egyptian plan to end the fighting in Gaza, as clashes between Israeli forces and Hamas resumed after a three-hour truce to allow humanitarian aid to reach trapped civilians. Hundreds of people took to the streets of the Palestinian territory during the hiatus to shop and visit relatives, despite reports of continued exchanges of fire in the northern Gaza Strip. As Israel&apos;s political leaders met in Tel Aviv to decide whether to expand their offensive into built-up areas or consider the ceasefire proposal, reports from Paris said the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, had brokered a deal. However, an Israeli government spokesman said that while Israel welcomed the proposal, it could accept the plan only if it halted &quot;hostile fire&quot; from Gaza and included measures to stop Hamas rearming. In a statement in Paris, Sarkozy said he strongly welcomed &quot;the acceptance by Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the French-Egyptian plan presented yesterday by [Egypt&apos;s] President Mubarak&quot;. The statement did not mention Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza. The French leader called for the plan to be &quot;put in place as quickly as possible in order to halt the suffering of the population&quot;. Osama Hamdan, the Hamas representative in Lebanon, said the movement would not accept any initiative that did not include the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza and the opening of all border crossings. &quot;Any proposal that does not include these points is unacceptable and no one should bother by presenting such proposals,&quot; he told al-Jazeera TV. Reports from Turkey said it had been given the task of forming an international force for Gaza, but sources in the foreign ministry said Turkey had not received such a request. At the UN, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, praised Egypt&apos;s efforts but insisted there could be no deal unless Hamas halted attacks on Israel. &quot;We need urgently to conclude a ceasefire that can endure and that can bring real security,&quot; Rice told the security council last night at a session to discuss the 12-day Israeli offensive. Earlier today, Israel announced a halt to the bombing starting at 1pm local time (1100 GMT). Israel later said it would refrain from firing for three hours, from 1pm to 4pm, every other day to enable &quot;humanitarian respite&quot; for the Gazans. It said the lull would allow approximately 80 trucks carrying medicine, medical supplies and basic food items to be delivered and 60,000 litres of fuel to be pumped through Nahal Oz terminal. The arrangement will be evaluated daily and could be aborted if necessary, the military said. As there is no communication between Israel and Hamas, the military is relying on the Palestinian media and international organisations to relay to the group the need to withhold fire on the days that the humanitarian goods are to be delivered. &quot;The fact that people left Gaza today shows that we managed to communication successfully,&quot; said a military spokesman, Peter Lerner. Humanitarian agencies believe the arrangement is inadequate for protecting aid workers and Palestinians travelling to pick up food and water. Chris Gunness, an official with the UN relief agency Unwra, said a convoy of trucks that left Gaza City heading for the Kerem Shalom crossing was almost hit twice by the Israeli army despite the military having been notified. &quot;It illustrates the hazards of trying to deliver aid in a very volatile situation,&quot; Gunness said. Before today&apos;s lull came into effect, sounds of heavy gunfire and thick plumes of smoke engulfed the Zeitoun neighbourhood, east of Gaza City. Israel said it had struck 40 Hamas targets during the hours of darkness, and Gaza health officials said new strikes this morning killed eight people. The military has called up thousands of reserve troops, which it could use to expand the offensive. The troops could be ready for action by Friday, defence officials told the Associated Press. Israel has been criticised for killing civilians in Gaza during its 12-day offensive. Palestinian officials in Gaza said Israel had told them the three hours would allow shops to open and funerals to take place. Israeli officials said the military had recommended the corridor be set up to give Palestinians periodic access to areas where they could stock up on vital goods. Aid agencies have complained of a mounting humanitarian crisis for the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli ground forces have cut the territory in half and encircled major populated areas. A World Bank statement said there were growing signs of a severe public health crisis because of a shortage of drinking water and a growing failure of the sewage system. Late yesterday France and Egypt proposed the initiative to stop the conflict in Gaza with an immediate ceasefire. Details were not released, but the plan would begin with an immediate halt to the fighting to allow in aid, followed by talks involving both Israel and Hamas. Israel&apos;s military planners have prepared for two more stages of conflict in Gaza that would escalate an already heavy air and ground offensive into a full military occupation of the strip and the toppling of Hamas. Although Israeli officials reportedly believe they have already secured some achievements in the 12-day war, and despite the mounting toll of civilian casualties, there is still a strong appetite among some to go further. In a third stage, troops would be ordered to fight their way into the heart of the urban areas, bringing much higher casualties on both sides. &quot;The plan is to enter the urban centres,&quot; one Israeli source told Reuters. A fourth stage would involve another call-up of thousands of soldiers and then a full military occupation of Gaza and the overthrow of Hamas, which won Palestinian elections three years ago. One Israeli report said the fourth stage could last several months or up to a year. Israel has sent thousands of troops and tanks into the Palestinian territory, where they have been locked in heavy fighting, and has continued with intensive artillery strikes from land and sea, as well as air strikes. Yesterday, in the deadliest day of fighting so far, more than 50 Palestinian civilians were killed when Israeli forces bombed two UN schools and several houses. Among the dead was an entire family of seven young children. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said he was deeply dismayed by the killings, which he called totally unacceptable. The UN has demanded an impartial investigation. More than 660 Palestinians have been killed in Israel&apos;s attack on Gaza, with nearly 3,000 wounded. A total of 10 people have died on the Israeli side. Three of them were civilians; four were Israeli soldiers mistakenly targeted by their own troops.

It is the excuse of the unquestioning; it is the refuge of the spineless; it is the fig leaf of those for whom the life of a child is less precious than hanging on to the tragic delusion that they are always in the right.  Clearly for some, the so-called &quot;right to defend themselves&quot; is much worthier and much greater a moral imperative than respect for human life, and it entitles them to bomb and shoot fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters - indeed anyone who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - and deprive them of their loved ones, their homes and their livelihoods, and bury them under the rubble of their houses, or of a clearly marked UN building. The world has tolerated this for long enough. Only hypocrites can believe that somehow there is any justice or morality, or benefit, in wanton death and destruction, and disregard for human life. Tinkering with specious arguments about who shot first or who has a God-given right to which chunk of arid land can no longer be regarded as a valid excuse for these kinds of actions, and anyone with any genuine moral sense must have the courage to see that by now. Federico MoscogiuriLondon  The Israeli response to the charge that it killed civilians in its bombing of a school was to the effect that its soldiers had been fired on by Hamas fighters from within the school and that the soldiers had returned fire. The Israelis argued that the moral responsibility for the killing lay with Hamas because it used civilians as &quot;human shields&quot;. This argument is unsustainable even on the doubtful assumption that the facts were as they assert. Imagine if a gunman kidnapped some Israeli civilians in Tel Aviv and began shooting at the police. The army surround the building and, if possible, will kill the gunman. Suppose that in their attempt to kill the gunman, the army considered bombing the building. Would the army be ethically justified? If they did bomb the building and killed the civilians, could they argue that the moral responsibility for the killing of civilians rests with the gunman or whatever organisation he had belonged to?Gerry RocheBallyvaughan, Co Clare, Ireland  I very much regret that you rushed to print Hamas&apos;s claim that Israel is responsible for the deaths at the UN school in Gaza on Tuesday. It is quite clear that mortars were being fired from the school grounds and the Hamas operatives were killed in the return fire. The civilians seem to have died as a result of the secondary explosion of ordinance stored on the premises. That particular school was used in a similar manner last August and Israel made an official complaint to the UN about it. It seems that the latter did not choose to take any action on the matter. The question you should be asking is why the UN allows its facilities to be used as munitions dumps and why Hamas, knowing this, encouraged civilians to shelter there in breach of the Geneva conventions.Martin D SternSalford  At last a broad-based and historical analysis of the Israel-Gaza conflict (How Israel brought Gaza to the brink of humanitarian catastrophe, G2, 7 January). This demolishes the barrage of Israeli propaganda (barely challenged in the media) and demonstrates clearly how Israel has been allowed to construct an identity of impunity through the unquestioning support of the US and its allies. There will be no equitable solution for Palestine unless two things happen in the west. First, an unequivocal challenge to the notion that criticism of Israel amounts to antisemitism. Second, the courage by governments and political parties generally in the UK and the US to risk alienating those members of their Jewish communities who both support them and Israel by making clear that the Israeli strategy is utterly unacceptable and self-defeating.Dr Roger BookerDunsfold, Surrey  The arms embargo on Israel proposed by Nick Clegg (We must stop arming Israel, 7 January) must be the absolute minimum international action in the face of Israel&apos;s onslaught against the civilian population of Gaza. From 1982 to 1994 the UK joined an EU-wide embargo as a result of similar Israeli atrocities in Lebanon, a reflection of Israel&apos;s propensity to use massive, overwhelming force against civilian targets in total defiance of international law and morality. The case for an embargo is perhaps even stronger now.  Also, UN officials&apos; calls for an independent inquiry into the bombing of one of its schools in Gaza must be heeded. Those found responsible, whether Israeli or Palestinian, must be brought to account, unlike the Israeli massacres at the UN compound at Qana in 1996 and 2006. Israel must understand that this culture of impunity for its actions has ended. All parties should be warned that they will be held accountable for their actions, and that the doors of The Hague will be opened wide to receive transgressors. Chris DoyleCouncil for Arab-British Understanding  Khalid Mish&apos;al (This brutality will never break our will to be free, 6 January) claims: &quot;If this is the free world whose values Israel is defending, then we want nothing to do with it.&quot; Never has a truer word been written. Hamas in Gaza has persecuted Christians, executed gays and murdered collaborators (35 of its Fatah rivals during this current conflict alone), and shows a cynical disregard for the civilians among whom it hides its rocket launchers. There can be no peace with this totalitarian regime. It is virulently antisemitic - not just anti-Israeli.Mrs L JuliusLondon", "publicationDate": "2009-01-08T00:01:00Z", "title": "Letters: No justification for this wanton destruction", "sentences": ["Imagine if a gunman kidnapped some Israeli civilians in Tel Aviv and began shooting at the police."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/08/letters-gaza-israel"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas"], "article": "The Gaza military operation has created a curious phenomenon in Israel. The country, at least for the first days of the attack, was united in a consensus that there was no choice. Even the most liberal among us felt Hamas had put Israel in a situation that no sovereign country could tolerate.  This was not just because of the rocket attacks. Hamas&apos;s stated long-term goal is a war of attrition with the explicit objective of destroying Israel. Peace is not within Hamas&apos;s vocabulary, which is characterised by the rabid antisemitism of its charter. It makes use of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion - one of the most notorious antisemitic forgeries of the last century - continues with the incantations that turn jihad against the Zionists into every Muslim&apos;s duty, and ends with suicide terrorism. True, some Hamas members argue that the charter does not reflect their worldview, but I have heard of no efforts to change it.  Israelis are united in the conviction that Hamas&apos;s hopes to vanquish Israel must be shattered. Israel must destroy the illusion that it can be wiped off the earth. This was one of the goals of the attack on Gaza. Israel proved that it has precise intelligence about the location of Hamas leaders, and even warned Hamas leaders by phone to leave their houses before they were bombed.  Israel also showed that it has precise intelligence about where explosives are stored. This is where the consensus became problematic: many of the explosives are stored below mosques, in schools and residential buildings. Bombing them results in what is euphemistically called &quot;collateral damage&quot;.  Here is where Israeli opinion is no longer unanimous. There are those who say &quot;Hamas can stop this - all they need to do is stop firing. They are responsible for the deaths of their children.&quot; They feel that Israel cannot be expected to accept this aggression.  Then there are those of us who feel that the price for being a civilised state is that you cannot fire at schools, even if an inhuman enemy fires from within. We feel that the ground incursion should have been avoided because we believe that the inhumanity of your enemy must not dictate your own deeds. No one can help but be horrified by the pictures of killed, maimed and terrified Palestinian children. And even though we despise an enemy that is not bound by any rules of recognisable civilisation, we must not let them dictate the terms of engagement.  Along with many other Israelis, I am enraged and disappointed by Israel&apos;s failure to restrict the use of force according to basic humanitarian values, and by its insufficient use of international help. We feel that Israel should have defined attainable objectives, such as a more durable ceasefire under international auspices and enforcement, and that this could have been achieved after the first few days of air strikes. And we feel horrified by the human price of the escalation of the ground incursion.  Israel is united by disdain for Hamas because it does not value the lives of its own children enough to avoid sacrificing them for political gain. But Israelis are divided on the extent to which we can let an enemy dictate the amount of human damage we inflict on them.  I will never stop criticising Israeli policies that I take to be wrong-headed, short-sighted or immoral. But I have no sympathy for the critics of Israel who refuse to see that there are ideologies who put destruction above human life and wellbeing. Hamas has changed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from something that can be solved, to a clash defined by the principle that only one side can survive - critics cannot expect Israel to accept this simply because it is the stronger side.  \u2022 Carlo Strenger is a professor of psychology at Tel Aviv University ", "publicationDate": "2009-01-09T00:01:00Z", "title": "Carlo Strenger: Why Israel is united", "sentences": ["\u2022 Carlo Strenger is a professor of psychology at Tel Aviv University "], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/09/united-israel-comment-carlo-strenger"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "It&apos;s time. Long past time. The best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa. In July 2005 a huge coalition of Palestinian groups laid out plans to do just that. They called on &quot;people of conscience all over the world to impose broad boycotts and implement divestment initiatives against Israel similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era&quot;. The campaign Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions was born. Every day that Israel pounds Gaza brings more converts to the BDS cause - even among Israeli Jews. In the midst of the assault roughly 500 Israelis, dozens of them well-known artists and scholars, sent a letter to foreign ambassadors in Israel. It calls for &quot;the adoption of immediate restrictive measures and sanctions&quot; and draws a clear parallel with the anti-apartheid struggle. &quot;The boycott on South Africa was effective, but Israel is handled with kid gloves ... This international backing must stop.&quot; Yet even in the face of these clear calls, many of us still can&apos;t go there. The reasons are complex, emotional and understandable. But they simply aren&apos;t good enough. Economic sanctions are the most effective tool in the non-violent arsenal: surrendering them verges on active complicity. Here are the top four objections to the BDS strategy, followed by counter-arguments. Punitive measures will alienate rather than persuade Israelis.  The world has tried what used to be called &quot;constructive engagement&quot;. It has failed utterly. Since 2006 Israel has been steadily escalating its criminality: expanding settlements, launching an outrageous war against Lebanon, and imposing collective punishment on Gaza through the brutal blockade. Despite this escalation, Israel has not faced punitive measures - quite the opposite. The weapons and $3bn in annual aid the US sends Israel are only the beginning. Throughout this key period, Israel has enjoyed a dramatic improvement in its diplomatic, cultural and trade relations with a variety of other allies. For instance, in 2007 Israel became the first country outside Latin America to sign a free-trade deal with the Mercosur bloc. In the first nine months of 2008, Israeli exports to Canada went up 45%. A new deal with the EU is set to double Israel&apos;s exports of processed food. And in December European ministers &quot;upgraded&quot; the EU-Israel association agreement, a reward long sought by Jerusalem. It is in this context that Israeli leaders started their latest war: confident they would face no meaningful costs. It is remarkable that over seven days of wartime trading, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange&apos;s flagship index actually went up 10.7%. When carrots don&apos;t work, sticks are needed. Israel is not South Africa.  Of course it isn&apos;t. The relevance of the South African model is that it proves BDS tactics can be effective when weaker measures (protests, petitions, backroom lobbying) fail. And there are deeply distressing echoes of apartheid in the occupied territories: the colour-coded IDs and travel permits, the bulldozed homes and forced displacement, the settler-only roads. Ronnie Kasrils, a prominent South African politician, said the architecture of segregation he saw in the West Bank and Gaza was &quot;infinitely worse than apartheid&quot;. That was in 2007, before Israel began its full-scale war against the open-air prison that is Gaza. Why single out Israel when the US, Britain and other western countries do the same things in Iraq and Afghanistan? Boycott is not a dogma; it is a tactic. The reason the strategy should be tried is practical: in a country so small and trade-dependent, it could actually work. Boycotts sever communication; we need more dialogue, not less. This one I&apos;ll answer with a personal story. For eight years, my books have been published in Israel by a commercial house called Babel. But when I published The Shock Doctrine, I wanted to respect the boycott. On the advice of BDS activists, including the wonderful writer John Berger, I contacted a small publisher called Andalus. Andalus is an activist press, deeply involved in the anti-occupation movement and the only Israeli publisher devoted exclusively to translating Arabic writing into Hebrew. We drafted a contract that guarantees that all proceeds go to Andalus&apos;s work, and none to me. I am boycotting the Israeli economy but not Israelis. Our modest publishing plan required dozens of phone calls, emails and instant messages, stretching between Tel Aviv, Ramallah, Paris, Toronto and Gaza City. My point is this: as soon as you start a boycott strategy, dialogue grows dramatically. The argument that boycotts will cut us off from one another is particularly specious given the array of cheap information technologies at our fingertips. We are drowning in ways to rant at each other across national boundaries. No boycott can stop us. Just about now, many a proud Zionist is gearing up for major point-scoring: don&apos;t I know that many of these very hi-tech toys come from Israeli research parks, world leaders in infotech? True enough, but not all of them. Several days into Israel&apos;s Gaza assault, Richard Ramsey, managing director of a British telecom specialising in voice-over-internet services, sent an email to the Israeli tech firm MobileMax: &quot;As a result of the Israeli government action in the last few days we will no longer be in a position to consider doing business with yourself or any other Israeli company.&quot; Ramsey says his decision wasn&apos;t political; he just didn&apos;t want to lose customers. &quot;We can&apos;t afford to lose any of our clients,&quot; he explains, &quot;so it was purely commercially defensive.&quot; It was this kind of cold business calculation that led many companies to pull out of South Africa two decades ago. And it&apos;s precisely the kind of calculation that is our most realistic hope of bringing justice, so long denied, to Palestine.

She doesn&apos;t want to see the pictures of dead children cut down by Israeli shells or read of the allegations of war crimes by her country&apos;s army as it kills Palestinians by the hundreds. But there is no escape. Raanan can hear the relentless Israeli bombardment by air, sea and land from her home, just three miles from the Gaza border. Hamas rockets keep hitting her community. And somewhere in the maelstrom of Gaza, her 20-year-old son is serving as an Israeli soldier. &quot;I&apos;d rather not know. I can&apos;t do anything about it. We didn&apos;t see the pictures of the Palestinian kids who were killed. It&apos;s easier not to feel,&quot; she said. &quot;I just turn on the news for five minutes a day and that&apos;s it, just to see if anybody says anything about my kid.&quot; But when Raanan thinks about her son - whom she prefers not to name - she also thinks about Palestinian mothers and their sons in Gaza. And that&apos;s when she finds her herself out of sync with the neighbours. &quot;I don&apos;t talk to the neighbours about it any more,&quot; she said. &quot;Hamas is violent. Hamas is stupid. I don&apos;t like what they are. But I don&apos;t feel angry towards them. I understand why they were elected, I understand why they act as they do.&quot; Attempting to understand has earned Raanan, a former operations officer in the Israeli air force, denunciations as a traitor and accusations of &quot;selling her nation to the devil&quot;. Doesn&apos;t she love her son?, they ask. The world has reeled in horror at revelations of Israeli atrocities as the Palestinian death toll has climbed toward 800. The International Red Cross was so outraged it broke its usual silence over an attack in which the Israeli army herded a Palestinian family into a building and then shelled it, killing 30 people and leaving the surviving children clinging to the bodies of their dead mothers. The army prevented rescuers from reaching the survivors for four days. Israel&apos;s shelling of a UN school that had been turned into a refugee centre near Gaza city, killing 42 people who had fled the fighting, drew further accusations of indifference to civilian lives. And Israel has struggled to justify the eradication of entire families, including small children, in pursuit of Hamas officials. But ordinary Israelis have been told little about this and when they are they generally brush it aside with assertions that it is sad but Hamas has brought it on the Palestinian people. Israel is the real victim, they say. The mainstream Israeli press has stuck firmly to the official line that it is a war of defence, a moral conflict forced on Israel by Hamas rocket fire. The scale of Palestinian civilian casualties is played down. The dead are overwhelmingly described as terrorists. The accounts of entire Palestinian families being wiped out are buried beneath stories of the Israeli trauma at Hamas attacks. &quot;The news said the Israeli army had killed 100 &apos;terrorists&apos; and also a bomb fell and 40 lost their lives,&quot; said Raanan about the shelling of the UN school. &quot;That was more or less the rhetoric that was used, so the focus was on the fact that we had managed to kill terrorists rather than we had also killed 40 other people. We weren&apos;t told who they were.&quot; There are alternative voices in the press, but they are mostly dismissed or shouted down. Israeli Arabs who protested against the war have been arrested for undermining national morale. Television anchormen berate critics of the onslaught on Gaza, questioning their patriotism.  The paradox of Israel is that most of its citizens tell the pollsters they agree with Raanan and the peace lobby that there should be a negotiated agreement of the establishment of a Palestinian state. But a significant number of Israelis now question whether this is possible. They view the continued conflict after Ariel Sharon pulled Jewish settlers and the military out of Gaza in 2005 as evidence that Arabs don&apos;t want peace; that giving up territory does not bring security.  Support for the vague notion of peace has been further buried under the rhetoric of the looming Israeli election, where the right in particular, led by a former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is playing on fear of a nuclear Iran in league with Hamas. Netanyahu, who is likely to win the 10 February ballot, has no intention of dismantling settlements or relinquishing the control that Israel exercises over the lives of Palestinians on the West Bank. He dances around the issue of a Palestinian state and has made clear in the past that what he wants to see amounts to a canton or bantustan (homeland) surrounded by Israeli control. And so the vast number of mainstream Israelis, while saying they support peace, once again find themselves in bed with the settlers and on the side of oppression. &quot;I hate to say we told you so,&quot; said Yisrael Medad, a prominent Jewish settler from Shilo, deep inside the West Bank. &quot;Now you hear all the time that it was a mistake to pull out of Gaza. You hear it on the television when it was never discussed before. More of the anchors are willing to ask that question. They would never ask that a year or two ago. They used to say ours was the extreme view. Now I would say that it&apos;s the mainstream, that no matter what we have done territorially speaking it&apos;s not going to satisfy them [the Palestinians]. They are always going to attack us.&quot; The settlers might be an extreme minority, but their views as to why Israeli soldiers are fighting in Gaza are not exceptional. Raanan lives in Ein Habsor, a moshav or cooperative agricultural community of about 1,000 people. It suffers regular hits from Hamas rockets. &quot;In the last few days we&apos;ve had two a day. In the vicinity. A couple inside. Close enough that it could have been your house,&quot; she said. No one was hurt but a student at the nearby Sapir college, where Raanan teaches public policy and administration, was killed by a Hamas rocket in February. Roni Yechiah, a 47-year-old father of four, died after the missile hit the car park. About a quarter of the families in Ein Habsor have left. &quot;They didn&apos;t so much go because of the rockets. It was because of the war and being really scared. They closed the schools. Those with little kids have mostly gone,&quot; said Raanan. It&apos;s not an atmosphere in which to question whether Israeli troops should be in Gaza. Most of the residents of Ein Habsor see the assault as a straightforward and necessary response to Hamas rockets, uncomplicated by issues such as occupation or the Israeli blockade of Gaza. But Raanan does question. She wants to see a government willing to negotiate seriously with the Palestinians, and she takes the view that just because Israel is strong enough to get one over on the Palestinians, that does not mean that it is in its interests to do so. Raanan also wants other Israelis to understand what the Palestinians are suffering. &quot;My moshav is quite right-wing,&quot; she said. &quot;They believe in using power and they don&apos;t particularly like Arabs. I don&apos;t talk to my neighbours much about these things. &quot;If you do open your heart to the fact that 40 completely innocent people in a United Nations school were killed you have a very hard time. It&apos;s difficult to open your heart to that place and also hold on to wanting the soldiers to succeed. It&apos;s a very hard split in personality. I think it&apos;s necessary but it&apos;s a difficult thing to do.&quot; Raanan says Israelis have dehumanised Palestinians to such an extent that they are no longer sensitive about who they kill. &quot;It&apos;s so difficult for them to put themselves in the place of someone who lives in Gaza. I guess you have to be able to dehumanise to be able to accept this type of war,&quot; she said. &quot;Israelis think of Hamas as a terrorist group and therefore anything we do to Hamas is OK. But the question is, why do we think it&apos;s OK also to kill civilians while we&apos;re killing or destroying Hamas? We rationalise; they do it to their own people. That&apos;s the rhetoric in Israel. It makes it OK to do what we&apos;re doing. In Israel we&apos;re brought up to be afraid of Arabs. It&apos;s a short step to hating them. It&apos;s unusual for people not to have hostile feelings toward Arabs, and it&apos;s racist feelings because it&apos;s a whole group.&quot; In Shilo, Medad finds himself in agreement with Raanan on one thing. He sees Israeli public opinion as increasingly indifferent to Palestinian suffering. But he says it is because of foreign criticism of Israel&apos;s actions. &quot;With the harshness of the criticism, they&apos;re slowly but surely turning off more Israelis to elements of humanity, consideration, so eventually they say: who the hell cares?&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t see the human face. In that situation we can do anything we want. There&apos;s a lack of identity of who the enemy is. He&apos;s not human any more.&quot; You might not know there was a war on while visiting Jerusalem&apos;s restaurants, Tel Aviv&apos;s frantic bars or the Azrieli shopping centre. The mall is one of the largest in Israel. Next door is the Kirya military headquarters, which houses Israel&apos;s defence ministry and the country&apos;s top military officers. The two buildings are linked by a bridge. Through the Gaza war, Israel has accused Hamas of endangering civilians by establishing military installations in populated areas. It has been a central justification by the army for the killing of Palestinian civilians. The shoppers at the Azrieli mall see no contradiction between that claim and Israel building its defence headquarters next door to a shopping centre. &quot;They might have a point if they attacked it,&quot; said Yoni Ahren, a computer engineer sipping coffee. &quot;But they don&apos;t. Instead they send suicide bombers to blow us up in the mall. The Palestinians set out to kill any Jew. The Israeli army sets out to kill Hamas and, yes, innocent Palestinians get killed. But that is not why the army is in Gaza.&quot; A soldier with Ahren, who declined to be identified because he was in uniform, said the Palestinians brought it on themselves. &quot;They voted for Hamas and then Hamas attacked Israel so it&apos;s their problem,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know if this [attack on Gaza] will solve anything. Probably not. We cannot get rid of Hamas. But the lesson we&apos;ve learnt is that we can&apos;t trust the Palestinians. We knew that with Arafat. Now we know it again.&quot; That is the upside of the conflict in Gaza for Medad. He believes it could help assure the future of the West Bank settlements by reminding Israelis that control over what Israelis call Judea and Samaria is what keeps Hamas rockets from falling on Tel Aviv. &quot;Things are changing. It&apos;s Gaza that&apos;s changed things,&quot; he said.  Shilo sits alongside the main road from Ramallah to Nablus, a long way from the &quot;security barrier&quot; Israel has built through the West Bank and Jerusalem. Shilo&apos;s residents are religious and mostly assert Israel&apos;s claim to all of the territory west of the Jordan river. A Palestinian presence is tolerated at best.  When Ariel Sharon pulled Jewish settlers out of Gaza in 2005, he called it a painful sacrifice for peace. Another view was that he had run out of political options and the pull-out was a way to stave off international pressure to talk to the Palestinians. What the dismantling of the Gaza settlements did not do was end the expansion of colonies on the West Bank. Shilo has grown by about 25% since 2005. The &quot;outposts&quot; around it, which are illegal even under Israeli law, have been expanding so fast that the &quot;Shilo block&quot;, with about 10,000 residents, is now as large as the main settlement that was dismantled in Gaza.  Most Israelis tell the pollsters they would sacrifice Shilo for peace. But influential voices are against it, among them the man tipped to be Netanyahu&apos;s defence minister. Moshe &quot;Bogie&quot; Yaalon, the former military commander in the West Bank, pressed the government for months to attack Gaza, and is against a withdrawal from the West Bank. Medad is confident that Yaalon&apos;s views will prevail. &quot;If you don&apos;t have control over a population, you suffer. You want to call it occupation... fine. But there has to be some sort of control, supervision,&quot; he said. Yaalon recently asked: &quot;What is the big difference between Gaza and Judea and Samaria - Judea and Samaria we can go in at night, we know where they are, and pick them up. In Gaza we can&apos;t do that.&quot; It is a view largely shared by Netanyahu, who has called for the assault on Gaza to be carried through until it forces Hamas from power. Most Israelis may not want to go as far as Netanyahu, but he remains ahead in the polls. Even on the left, attitudes have hardened. Support for Ehud Barak, the Labour party leader and defence minister, has risen sharply because of the assault on Gaza.  Jeff Halper, a veteran peace campaigner, says this is further evidence that Israeli public opinion is principally shaped by fear. &quot;The Israeli public is being held hostage by its own leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;This whole idea there&apos;s no partner for peace has been internalised by Israelis. Everything has been reduced in Israel to terrorism because Israel has eliminated the political context of occupation and claims it only wants peace and has made generous offers and the Arabs always reject them.&quot; &quot;Seventy per cent of Israeli Jews say they don&apos;t want the occupation. They would be happy with the two-state solution. But what they say to us is: &apos;You don&apos;t have to talk to me about peace, I want peace. The Arabs won&apos;t let us because the Arabs are just terrorists.&apos; There is in Israel a deeply held assumption that Arabs are our permanent enemies.&quot; Raanan hopes not. She is counting the days until the Gaza assault is over and her son is pulled out. But the personal trauma will not be over if and when that happens. Her second son is due to be called up in six months.

Instead of walking down a path of peace, Hamas has led its people down a dead-end road of war. &quot;We are here to show solidarity with the people of Israel whose lives have been threatened with missiles for the last eight years, and to show solidarity with the IDF (Israel Defence Force) who are risking their lives to protect our way of life. We tell the terrorists, enough is enough, they, and not us, will be defeated.&quot; Myer Malin, an 85-year-old Normandy veteran from Pinner, said: &quot;I have come in support of Israel because they are under attack by Hamas and they have been unfairly represented in the press and media generally. &quot;Hamas provoked a war quite deliberately, the way they seized power in Gaza is comparable to the way Hitler seized power in Germany \u2013 they got themselves in a good position with the welfare service and promptly evicted the opposition. I was in Egypt in 1946-47 and have no bitterness towards Arabs. In this case, I think there is no such thing as disproportion. If you have got a war to fight then you fight.&quot; Tania Schwartz, from north London, said: &quot;Where has the media been for the last eight years when the rockets have been landing in Israel? Do you know that kids there wet the bed from fear? The moment the rockets stop, the Israeli soldiers will stop. They are desperate to get out of there and get home. But if it doesn&apos;t stop, the next time it will be Tel Aviv and Israel will be extinct.&quot; At the Manchester rally, Labour MPs called for an end to Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israeli towns such as Sderot, and asserted Israel&apos;s right to defend itself. Ivan Lewis, the Labour MP for Bury South, said: &quot;This community stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel in the good and the bad times. We do not apply double standards to Israel and the challenges that she faces. &quot;It&apos;s the first duty of any government in any democracy to protect the security of its citizens. No government in a democracy would survive if it allowed rockets to be fired from a neighbouring territory on to its civilian population and did nothing in response.&quot; He told the crowd of about 2,000 people that those who fired rockets &quot;are no different to the terrorists who created murderous carnage in London on 7/7&quot;. Louise Ellman, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said: &quot;We should stand together to stick up for Israel, to support Israel&apos;s right to defend herself, to say no to Hamas, to say yes to a negotiated solution, yes to peace, no to terror.&quot; One of the demonstrators, Jacqui Cohen, 62, of Leeds, said misreporting by the media created antisemitism. &quot;The rest of the world is absolutely against Israel. &quot;No one is there to stand up for the Jewish people. The press is so terribly, terribly anti-Israel. There&apos;s people being killed on both sides but no one reports the other side. It&apos;s causing massive antisemitism.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-11T17:07:00Z", "title": "Pro-Israeli protests in London and Manchester", "sentences": ["But if it doesn&apos;t stop, the next time it will be Tel Aviv and Israel will be extinct.&quot; At the Manchester rally, Labour MPs called for an end to Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israeli towns such as Sderot, and asserted Israel&apos;s right to defend itself."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/12/proisraeli-protests-london-manchester"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "The problem is to define victory. At first, Israel said that the goal of its onslaught against Gaza was to stop the Hamas rockets. But after more than two weeks and nearly 900 Palestinians killed, almost a third of them children and young people, the rockets are still flying into Israel by the dozen each day. So then Israel said the end game was deterrence - to make Hamas recognise that the price of breaching the next ceasefire was so high it would no longer fire the rockets even if it has them. But there are many among Israel&apos;s political and military elite who doubt that deterrence works with the Islamist group. Every rocket fired into Israel is a victory for Hamas and it is unlikely to stop unless a ceasefire comes with major Israeli concessions, such as lifting the economic blockade of Gaza. And then Hamas would claim its own victory. So the army has been preparing militarily and politically for phase three - an escalation of the assault that is thought likely to include a major offensive into urban areas such as Gaza City, with all the risks that street fighting brings.  Hamas has said that if Israel attacked the city it would fall into its trap and that the Israeli military would lose so many soldiers battling through the warren of narrow streets, facing roadside bombs and hit-and-run attacks, that the Israeli public would never stand for it.  The army claims Hamas&apos;s armed wing has taken a severe beating and that the relatively low number of Israeli casualties so far - with nine soldiers killed, four of them by an Israeli shell - is evidence that resistance is failing. &quot;The experience so far shows that Gaza is not turning in to a death trap for the Israeli forces,&quot; said Shlomo Brom, a former chief of strategic planning in the Israeli military. &quot;I don&apos;t think fear of casualties is the concern here. The concern is to decide what this operation is for. The political cost will be dependent on what is in phase three.&quot; The military and the politicians are divided not only over whether to go to phase three, but what it is intended to achieve.  Brom said one goal would be to ensure that Hamas could no longer smuggle weapons into Gaza through tunnels under the border with Egypt. &quot;If there is breakdown in the next ceasefire the rockets will be launched not only against Be&apos;er Sheva but Tel Aviv,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to prevent it, and that was not achieved yet. That is not simple to achieve because we don&apos;t expect Hamas to deliver it.  &quot;We expect the Egyptians to deliver it, so one of the purposes of the continuation of the fighting is to put pressure on Egypt or the international community to put pressure on Egypt.&quot; If that is the goal, then the focus of the next phase of the assault will be along the border with Egypt where Israel may reoccupy the frontier and bring the Gazan town of Rafah under its control. Israel has tried occupying Rafah before and been forced out by the high number of Israeli casualties.  However, there are those in the military who see phase three as serving another purpose entirely. The Israeli press reported yesterday that the officer in command of military operations in Gaza had urged the cabinet to allow the army to make the most of a &quot;once in a generation&quot; opportunity. &quot;If we don&apos;t do that we&apos;ll be missing a historic opportunity,&quot; Major General Yoav Galant is reported to have said.  Brom said Galant&apos;s history opportunity was a desire to topple Gaza&apos;s Islamist government.  &quot;I think the main risk in this campaign is that through a series of incremental decisions to go a step further we may find ourselves in a situation in which eventually we change the objective of the war, and instead of the objective being to create this new balance of deterrence, the objective will be to topple Hamas, to destroy Hamas,&quot; he said.  Such a move would be fraught with danger, not least the risk of becoming trapped in Gaza in order to maintain control if the Hamas administration is toppled, he continued. &quot;I think we are capable of taking the city of Gaza with a relatively small number of casualties.  &quot;The problem is whether we are not changing our political aims and creating a situation in which we are bogged down in Gaza, in the sense that we reoccupy the Gaza Strip and now we have to decide what we are going to do with this poisonous beast.&quot; Military stages Phase One On the first day of the week-long air bombardment of Gaza about 250 Gazans were killed, many of them policemen at a graduation ceremony. In the following days, much of the public infrastructure was bombed. Phase Two During the ground invasion a week later, Israeli tanks and troops seized large parts of northern Gaza, principally areas from where Hamas fired rockets into Israel. They also laid siege to towns and refugee camps. Phase Three This is the planned ground operation into urban areas such as Gaza City. Hamas has said the city streets will be the soldiers&apos; graveyard. But some in the army believe Hamas has been considerably weakened and such an operation would topple it from power. Phase Four Plans for the complete reoccupation of Gaza have been drawn up, but the Israeli government says this is not on the cards.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T00:01:00Z", "title": "Analysis: Ultimate aim remains unclear as government prepares for next move", "sentences": ["&quot;If there is breakdown in the next ceasefire the rockets will be launched not only against Be&apos;er Sheva but Tel Aviv,&quot; he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/12/gaza-israel"}, {"tags": ["UK news", "Gaza", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas"], "article": "The sign taped to the front of 10-month-old Ezra Wiesenberg read: &quot;The IDF don&apos;t hide behind me!

Across the street, behind a cordon, the Rabbi Avraham Greenberg took his Israeli passport from its plastic wallet and slowly set it on fire with a gas lighter until its ashes floated around him. He explained to the small crowd on the pavement that he had been born in the state of Israel but he was ashamed to hold a passport from that country. He stood with more than a dozen Orthodox rabbis who joined in chants of &quot;Judaism here to stay, Zionism no way&quot;. But many more thousands of Jews attended in support of the rally rather than opposing it, waving Israeli flags and placards saying End Hamas Terror and wearing Stars of David on their faces. Henry Grunwald, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told the crowd, which was estimated at 15,000 by the organisers: &quot;We are the people who want peace and who want life for Israel.&quot; The chief rabbi, Sir Jonathan Sacks, gave a message to Hamas: &quot;Stop wanting Israel to die, start wanting your children to live. Why, Hamas, do you hold in contempt, not only Israeli lives but Palestinian lives?&quot; To applause, Ron Prosor, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, said: &quot;The age of terrorism must be brought to a close so that together we can build an age of peace. Our soldiers are doing their duty with honour, dignity and sacrifice.&quot; Listening to the speeches, Myer Malin, an 85-year-old Normandy veteran from Pinner in London, stood wearing his own medals and those of his father, who fought in the first world war. &quot;I have come in support of Israel because they are under attack by Hamas and they have been unfairly represented in the press and media generally.

People are shouting deaths to Jews and running amok in Golders Green. We are saying &quot; Jews cannot get pushed around in this country&quot;. I have got kids at university and I am really concerned for them.&quot; As the crowd around the square&apos;s frozen fountains sang the British and Israeli national anthems, Ann Wiesenberg, originally from New York, said of the protest sign on her baby son: &quot;We feel that very often Hamas is actually putting children in front of them. We are highlighting the point that the IDF don&apos;t hide behind ci\u00a9vilians. They are putting their own soldiers at risk so as to kill as few civilians as possible.&quot; Her husband, Andrew, said: &quot;Hamas terrorism is like a cancer really \u2013 unfortunately. When you treat cancer you kill some of the innocent blood cells. We regret any loss of human life. The cancer analogy is very important \u2013 you don&apos;t stop before you finish the course of treatment, otherwise it will come back stronger.&quot; As he spoke, a well-dressed middle-aged woman walked past \u2013 clearly not having planned to attend the rally \u2013 and shouted: &quot;Shame on you Israel.&quot;The crowd, marshalled by hundreds of officials from the Community Security Trust, the organisation in charge of security for Britain&apos;s Jews and their institutions, as well as by the Metropolitan police, mostly dispersed after an hour, though a die-hard bunch lingered to exchange shouts across the barricades with the counter demonstrators. They pushed at the fluorescent yellow line of police officers that held them in as a speaker with a megaphone said: &quot;now you know what it is like to be squeezed into a small piece of land and pushed by an oppressor&quot;. \u00a9The rally followed a large protest against the military action in Gaza in London on Saturday, during which violent clashes broke out.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T00:06:37Z", "title": "Thousands of UK Jews join London rally against Hamas", "sentences": ["But if it doesn&apos;t stop, the next time it will be Tel Aviv and Israel will be extinct.&quot; Standing nearby, David Fordham, 49, from Hatch End, said his reasons for coming were very much different to those of Schwartz."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/12/gaza-israelandthepalestinians"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Maccabi Haifa", "Maccabi Tel Aviv", "Gaza", "Sport", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "It was half-time when the announcement was made. The match, a quarter-final in Israel&apos;s Toto Cup, had attracted an unusually high number of fans for a midweek clash. Sure Hapoel Tel Aviv versus league leaders Maccabi Haifa was always a big event, with two of Israel&apos;s most popular teams playing each other. But with the country at war, and rockets falling on the southern towns of Ashkelon, Beersheba and Ashdod you would have thought that football was the least of the crowd&apos;s worries. But 7,000 fans turned up, 300 bussed in especially from the south, to hear the bad news. &quot;It would not be appropriate to continue holding matches,&quot; read the statement released by the Israeli Football Association, &quot;while citizens in the south of the country are under the threat of rockets and are living in shelters.&quot; Unluckily for Haifa&apos;s fans it wasn&apos;t with immediate effect. The second half began and Hapoel Tel Aviv ran out 2-0 winners. Rockets have become something of an occupational hazard for Israeli footballers. It&apos;s the second season in three years that the FA has had to step in to postpone matches. In 2006 it was Hezbollah&apos;s rockets that terrorised the north of the country. Back then it was the league champions Maccabi Haifa that bore the brunt after their stadium was hit by a Katyusha. As a result the league was suspended and matches were banned from taking place in the north of the country. This time it&apos;s Hamas&apos;s rockets in the south that have been causing panic and the Israeli FA decided to act, initially placing a 40km exclusion zone around matches close to the Gaza strip when the stadium of third division club Hapoel Ashkelon was hit by a rocket minutes before the team was due to start training. &quot;The rocket hit the penalty box and it was a very scary experience,&quot; coach Shiye Feigenbaum told the Jerusalem Post. &quot;There could have been a disaster had the players or the youth [team] been on the field at the time.&quot; Then, last week, the Israeli FA decided to postpone all the weekend league fixtures \u2013 a move that provoked accusations of being weak and for removing one of the last forms of escapism the residents of southern Israel still had left. But the postponement only tells half the story. Before the decision was made, the FA had a more pressing decision to make: what to do with the four Toto Cup quarter-finals that were due to go ahead. Three, including the Hapoel Tel Aviv-Maccabi Haifa game and a match involving Ashdod FC, who had to relocate to the Ramat Gan National Stadium near Tel Aviv to train, went ahead. In fact, Ashdod came through the encounter with Maccabi Netanya 4-1 winners, which provided a shot in the arm for the town&apos;s residents. But one match was not allowed to go ahead: Bnei Sakhnin versus Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona. The reason? Bnei Sakhnin are Israel&apos;s only top flight Arab club and the Israeli FA feared violence between its predominantly Muslim fans and their Jewish opponents. The decision to single out the club was illuminating. The side holds a unique position in Israeli society. Sakhnin is a small, scrappy Arab city in northern Galilee filled with minarets and set in lush, expansive olive groves. Nearly 20% of Israel&apos;s population is Arab, those who stayed behind when Israel was created in 1948, and they have endured a fractured relationship with their Jewish neighbours. While Israel&apos;s Arabs complain that their community suffers from poverty and neglect thanks to years of discrimination, many of their countrymen view them as fifth columnists. Yet one institution existed that became a totem for Israeli Arab pride: Bnei Sakhnin, their local football team. Against all the odds the Sons of Sakhnin made it to Israel&apos;s top league, the Ligat Ha&apos;Al, within a decade and became something of cause celebre for progressives and peaceniks. Arab fans from around the Middle East took the team to their heart, braving travel bans in their home countries by flying to neighbouring Jordan, which has a peace agreement with Israel, and travelling over the border into the West Bank and then on to Israel proper by taxi to watch them play. Even the Qatari government got involved, stumping up the cash to renovate the team&apos;s crumbling ground. In return, Bnei Sakhnin named it the Doha Stadium. Under the stewardship of then chairman Mazen Genaim, the team won the State Cup in 2004, enjoying a subsequent brief foray in the Uefa Cup that was eventually snuffed out by a superior Newcastle United team featuring Alan Shearer. Their captain Abbas Suan, himself a Muslim, was called up to the national team, much to the chagrin of many mainstream Israeli football fans. That reticence was short lived after Suan scored a vital last-minute equaliser for Israel against Ireland during the qualification campaign for the 2006 World Cup. Time magazine recognised his achievements in promoting peace between Israel&apos;s Jewish and Arab communities and made him one of their &apos;Heroes of the Year.&apos; Where once Arab footballers were jeered they had suddenly started to be accepted. After the Ireland game, one Israeli newspaper even ran the headline: &quot;No Arabs, No Goals&quot;. But over the past few years attitudes on both sides have hardened. A poll quoted by the New York Times during Israel&apos;s 60th birthday celebrations claimed that a majority of Israelis supported an &quot;Arab transfer&quot; into Palestinian territory as part of any final settlement agreement, while many football commentators in Israel have observed that the fans of Bnei Sakhnin have hardened their attitude to their Israeli opponents, singing Islamic and, it is claimed, anti-Israeli songs on the terraces. This season Bnei Sakhnin have struggled on the pitch. They currently lie three places off the bottom and have become a focus for anti-Arab sentiment as the peace process has faltered. In particular, their matches with Beitar Jerusalem \u00ad\u2014 both Israel&apos;s biggest club and one with a strong nationalistic streak and penchant for singing racist, anti-Arab songs \u2014 are fast becoming the most brutal derbies of an already derby-packed season. In fact their players and fans need to be joined by an armed police escort 15km outside Jerusalem every time they play a match. Last year Beitar had to play a game behind closed doors after their fans sang songs defaming the Prophet Muhammad during a cup game. But it was a huge protest that took place in Sakhnin before the Toto Cup games were due to take place that not only shocked the Israeli FA into action, but also reopened the debate about the country&apos;s Arab, Muslim minority. Debate raged in the Israeli press over how many people turned up to the pro-Gaza protests, where Palestinian flags were flown and plastic baby dolls were brandished covered in red paint to mimic blood. The Jerusalem Post reported that only 10,000 protesters turned up, singing anti-Israeli songs and flying Hamas flags, which for many Israelis is akin to flying the Swastika. Ha&apos;aretz on the other hand, reported that 100,000 people protested and that it was largely peaceful. Prominent in the protests was Genaim, the football club&apos;s outspoken former chairman who left his position at Bnei Sakhnin in November to successfully be elected the city&apos;s mayor. But though once Genaim was seen as a man that preached tolerance and coexistence, suddenly he was being called a traitor in the press. &quot;I call on Israel to end the war immediately and lift the siege,&quot; Genaim was quoted as saying in Israel&apos;s most popular daily Yedioth Ahronoth. &quot;I send a greeting to Gaza&apos;s residents, who are facing the Israeli occupation machine. Long live Palestine, whose capital is Jerusalem, and long live the shahids (martyrs).&quot; The report provoked a furious response with one Israeli Knesset member, Avigdor Liberman, chairman of the hardline Yisrael Beiteinu party, claiming that &quot;just as the Israeli government knows the operation in Gaza can&apos;t be stopped until Hamas is defeated, so must we act against those citizens of Israel that are not loyal to the state. The protest in Sakhnin proves once again that the Israeli-Arabs are loyal to Hamas and those who wish for the state&apos;s destruction.&quot; Genaim claims he was misquoted and that he didn&apos;t use the inflammatory word shahids. When Ha&apos;aretz asked whether he had praised Gaza&apos;s martyrs he said: &quot;Absolutely not. I was raised on ideals of co-existence and no political position will change me. Anyone who thinks I or my politics have changed because I&apos;m mayor now is full of rubbish. Whatever I had to say \u2014 I always said it aloud and without any shame. I have the courage to speak my mind freely. I was aggrieved and I will sue for libel. Al Jazeera aired my speech and the whole world saw it.&quot; Yesterday two important announcements were made. The first was that, under pressure from the press, next weekend&apos;s Ligat Ha&apos;Al fixtures would now go ahead, pending a meeting today of the Israeli FA. But &quot;sensitive&quot; matches involving Arab football clubs, including Bnei Sakhnin, will continue to be prohibited for fear of violence. The second was that Abbas Suan, the Israeli Arab who became such a symbol for Jewish-Arab coexistence after playing for the Israeli national team three-and-a-half years ago, has returned to his hometown club on a two-year contract. Bnei Sakhnin needs him now more than ever.

Their vigil was watched benignly by clusters of policemen strategically grouped nearby; passing pedestrians and drivers offered words of support and condemnation in equal measure \u2013 and within an hour the protest had run its course and disbanded.  On the face of it, last night&apos;s show of solidarity for Gaza epitomised Israel&apos;s commitment to free and fair expression for all its citizens, but the reality behind the mask tells a very different story. This was Jaffa, after all, a largely Arab city on the edge of Tel Aviv, where the locals find themselves in a precarious position at the best of times, and even more so when the country is firmly on a war footing.  Seven days ago, I attended a protest at the same spot, which boasted a far larger \u2013 and far more vocal \u2013 crowd than last night&apos;s vigil: scores of demonstrators loudly denouncing Israel&apos;s leaders as war criminals, rowdy brandishing of incendiary placards and flags, and a proud mixture of Israeli Jews and Arabs joining forces to voice their opposition to the war.  However, a week is a long time in internal Israeli politics, during which time several local Arab activists were arrested on trumped-up charges and held in jail, purportedly to prevent them carrying out future acts of sedition. Their detention served to scare off not only them from attending subsequent demonstrations, but also their friends, families and the rest of the Jaffa community, leading to the sharp drop in attendees at last night&apos;s protest.  &quot;It feels like old-school state intimidation,&quot; said one man who braved the threat of arrest to show his support for yesterday&apos;s vigil. &quot;What&apos;s worse is that Israel trumpets itself as a democracy, yet takes measures such as these [to stifle dissenting voices]. At least in places like Syria, the public aren&apos;t fooled into thinking their rulers are in any way democratic.&quot; He described the reaction he had encountered when handing out leaflets advertising the demonstration to fellow members of the community: &quot;People are frightened to come, and there&apos;s nothing we can say to convince them differently. We can&apos;t tell them they won&apos;t be arrested, since the evidence of the last week proves otherwise.&quot; He told me that stop-and-search tactics have increased in the area since the outbreak of hostilities in Gaza, adding to the sense of state-sponsored pressure on the local Arabs.  Yesterday, at the same time as the watered-down vigil was taking place, Israel&apos;s Central Elections Committee upped the ante in the anti-Arab stakes, banning two Arab political parties, Balad and UAL, from running in the upcoming general election. After two petitions claimed that Balad&apos;s and UAL&apos;s political platform aimed to undermine Israel&apos;s existence as a Jewish, democratic state, and that the parties were supporting armed struggle against Israel, the committee voted decisively to kick them out of the electoral race.  Balad&apos;s chairman Jamal Zahalka was defiant in the face of the committee&apos;s stance, declaring that &quot;Israeli democracy, not Balad, is being put to the test today. Balad is a democratic and progressive party, and we believe in the basic principle of equality for all people. All we demand is democracy! What are you afraid of when we ask for equality? We are the sons of this country, we were born here and we are willing to treat you with equality, so why don&apos;t you?&quot; UAL chair Ahmed Tibi was equally scathing in his attacks on the Israeli government, asserting that &quot;Any vote given to Kadima is a bullet in the chest of a Palestinian child in Gaza.&quot; He had short shrift for those accusing his party of undermining the Israeli status quo: &quot;We never said that we don&apos;t recognise the state of Israel. We are part of it, but we will never accept Zionism, which is an ideology that aspires to banish us from our homes.&quot; While appeals are expected to be lodged in the Israeli high court of justice by the suspended parties&apos; chairmen, Zahalka maintained that the damage had already been done, predicting that the move would lead to a deeper crisis between the country&apos;s Jewish and Arab citizens. There is little doubt that he is right on that front; the already-strained relationship between Israel&apos;s Jews and Arabs has now suffered two body blows this month alone, in the shape of the Gaza offensive and, now, the clampdown on Arab political activity.  Whether on the balmy streets of Jaffa, or in the upper echelons of Israeli officialdom, the message appears to be the same: if you raise so much as a murmur of dissent in a time of war, the strong arm of Israeli law will come crashing down and stifle your protests in a flash.

More than 90% of Jewish Israelis back the invasion, although that view is reversed among Israeli Arabs, according to the latest War and Peace Index in December. Attitudes among Israelis are so hardened that 80% would oppose Israel opening its crossings to Gaza even if Hamas stopped firing on southern towns such as Ashkelon and Sderot, the monthly survey, conducted by Tel Aviv University for the last 15 years, showed. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that Israelis feel that justice is on their side,&quot; said Ephraim Yaar, who conducts the survey. The base point for the Israeli perspective is 2005, when the Jewish state unilaterally withdrew its military bases and settlers from inside Gaza. &quot;The Israeli public sees that the Palestinians had their chance and instead of using it they decided to attack,&quot; said Yaar. Palestinians see the conflict in longer terms, dating back at least to 1967, when Israel began occupying the West Bank and Gaza following the Six Day war. But to Israelis, the past three years have unfolded exactly as the right predicted. Hamas and other militant groups, who claimed the withdrawal was the result of their resistance, turned Gaza into a launching pad to fire rockets into southern Israeli towns. &quot;The left is now buying the argument that if you can&apos;t make the Israelis and the Palestinians love each other then the best we can have is a balance of fear, the old idea of deterrence,&quot; said Paul Frosh, senior lecturer in communications at Hebrew University, who said he normally voted for Meretz, a leftist party closely aligned to the peace movement. The mistrust that has characterised Israeli attitudes to politicians over the past three to five years virtually vanished with the beginning of the war. There is little doubt in the public&apos;s mind that this war was launched for the right reasons. &quot;Most Israelis thought it was about time for the politicians to do something about Hamas in the south,&quot; said Tamar Hermann, of the Israel Democracy Institute, who also conducts the War and Peace survey. The government&apos;s &quot;reading of the public desire was one of the major inputs into the decision to launch this operation,&quot; said Hermann. The War and Peace index suggested that Israelis could live without peace as long as they had quiet. For instance, in April last year it showed few were willing to &quot;pay&quot; for peace by ceding land. It also showed that the conflict with the Palestinians was the least of their worries, with only 12% of Israelis rating an intensification of the conflict as the gravest threat on their horizon. The top threat, perceived by 28% of Israelis, was Iran&apos;s nuclear capabilities. Next, perceived by 20% of people, was that the military would not be ready to fight the next conflict. &quot;This is the mentality of a besieged nation,&quot; said Yaar, arguing that Israel is behaving exactly as other countries do when confronted by war. &quot;If you take England and the US when they felt there was a need to end the war against Nazi Germany, look at what they did in Dresden. You are talking about tens of thousands of innocent German civilians who were killed,&quot; he said. &quot;Support for the operation is strongly related to the fact that the number of casualties among soldiers is relatively low,&quot; said Hermann. Yet with the operation in its third week and fierce debate raging between the politicians as to whether to push deeper into the urban centres of the Gaza Strip, public opinion may be about to become more hostile to the operation.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-14T00:01:00Z", "title": "Backing for Gaza invasion remains strong among Israelis", "sentences": ["Attitudes among Israelis are so hardened that 80% would oppose Israel opening its crossings to Gaza even if Hamas stopped firing on southern towns such as Ashkelon and Sderot, the monthly survey, conducted by Tel Aviv University for the last 15 years, showed."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/14/gaza-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["European Union", "Gaza", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "European commission"], "article": "European plans to turn Israel into a &quot;privileged&quot; partner enjoying special political, diplomatic and trade links were frozen by Brussels today in protest at the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Senior officials and diplomats in Brussels also said Czech pressure to stage a Europe-Israel summit to launch a new &quot;special relationship&quot; was facing stiff resistance and would probably not take place. Senior figures in Brussels said the European move was ordered by Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the commissioner for external relations, who instructed various departments of the European commission to suspend implementation of a policy decided last year &quot;to upgrade&quot; relations between Israel and the EU. &quot;Senior people are saying there should be a pause in close ties between Israel and the union,&quot; said a European diplomat. &quot;The commission has frozen contacts with the Israelis on practical aspects of the upgrade,&quot; another diplomat said. Commission officials denied that the decision amounted to sanctions against Israel. &quot;There&apos;s been no talk of sanctions. We&apos;re very focused on the Egyptian [ceasefire] plan,&quot; said a senior official. The EU and the Israeli government agreed last summer on the new policy giving Tel Aviv a privileged partnership with Europe, entailing greater integration into Europe&apos;s single market. Ramiro Cibrian-Uzal, the EU commission&apos;s ambassador to Israel, told reporters in Jerusalem today that the war in Gaza meant bilateral relations between Israel and the 27-nation bloc &quot;cannot proceed business as usual&quot;. He said: &quot;In a war situation, in a situation in which Israel is at war, using its war means in a very dramatic way, in a powerful way in Gaza, everybody realises that it is not the appropriate time to upgrade bilateral relations.&quot; The decision to suspend implementation comes as a blow to the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, a month before she faces the rightwing hawk Benjamin Netanyahu in a general election. The new European policy was in part designed to help Livni win the election and late last year she had two &quot;tempestuous&quot; meetings with Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, demanding quicker European action to boost her poll chances. EU foreign ministers responded with a decision to push ahead with the policy. While the practical impact of the freeze may be minimal, officials said, the political and symbolic signals are strong, controversial and unusual. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t surprise me if people like Fererro-Waldner were working not on an upgrade, but on a downgrade,&quot; said a third diplomat in Brussels. The protest move has been orchestrated by the commission which, at a meeting in Strasbourg yesterday, agreed that &quot;people should stay away from Israel&quot;, said another source. The decision is likely to run into strong criticism among governments of the 27 member states. The Czech Republic assumed the EU presidency at the beginning of the year with a robust pro-Israeli campaign in mind. &quot;The Czech presidency is seen to be very keen to take an American line on this,&quot; said the source. The Czechs have been seeking to organise a European summit with Israel in May or June in Prague to mark the launch of the new deal. &quot;They want a highly symbolic summit to demonstrate the EU&apos;s partnership with Israel as particularly privileged,&quot; said one of the diplomats. &quot;It&apos;s all off for the moment; particularly inappropriate. It would be tremendously divisive.&quot; British diplomats neither supported nor opposed the commission move, saying only that the priority was to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-14T17:19:57Z", "title": "Europe stalls on closer Israel links in Gaza protest", "sentences": ["The EU and the Israeli government agreed last summer on the new policy giving Tel Aviv a privileged partnership with Europe, entailing greater integration into Europe&apos;s single market."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/14/europe-israel-diplomacy-gaza-protest"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Qatar"], "article": "Egypt, Saudi Arabia and half a dozen other Arab countries are refusing to attend an emergency Arab summit in Qatar tomorrow, underlining deep divisions over how to respond to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. Fourteen members of the 22-strong Arab League have said that they will attend the hastily arranged meeting in the Qatari capital, Doha, but regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia staked out its own position by convening a rival summit of Gulf countries in Riyadh today. The flurry of inter-Arab diplomacy comes as Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, seeks to broker an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Mubarak insists leaders should meet, if at all, on the margins of a long-scheduled Arab economic summit in Kuwait early next week. Egypt has been heavily criticised for acquiescing in, or even colluding with, the Israeli onslaught and for refusing to open its border with the Gaza Strip. Syria, Hamas&apos;s most important Arab backer, is behind the Qatari call for a summit. President Bashar al-Assad, Syria&apos;s president, would like to see Egypt and Jordan \u2013 which both have peace treaties with Israel \u2013 at least recall their ambassadors from Tel Aviv in protest at the Gaza offensive. Neither has done so. Jordan has publicly criticised Israel, but was quick to deny this week that there had been firing across its border into Israel. Middle East analysts and diplomats say Mubarak and Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah fear raising expectations from a summit when the Arab world is so deeply divided. Morocco, also in the western camp, said today that it would not attend any summit. &quot;It is distressing that these underlying disagreements tend to push the crucial interests of the Arab nation into the background, especially the Palestinian cause,&quot; a Moroccan government statement said. Tunisia, Jordan, Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait have also said they will not attend a Doha summit, meaning that supporters are still one short of the quorum of 15 required by Arab League rules. &quot;We believe that a summit in Doha would be frustrating for the Arab street because there is no proper preparation,&quot; Hassan Issa, a retired Egyptian diplomat, told al-Jazeera TV. &quot;There are differences between Arab countries. You simply cannot have a summit in an atmosphere like this. It would be counterproductive.&quot; Wrangling between governments contrasts with Arab public opinion enraged by images of the bloodshed in Gaza, with millions watching graphic coverage on al-Jazeera and other satellite TV channels. Every Arab country has had angry demonstrations against Israel. Lebanon&apos;s Hizbullah, which fought Israel in 2006, hails Hamas as a like-minded resistance movement but apart from other Islamist groups such as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, elsewhere in the region it is less a case of admiration for Hamas than sympathy for the ordinary Palestinians bearing the brunt of the Israeli offensive. Governments accept that Egypt is the only Arab state capable of brokering an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, but Mubarak has also been the target of popular wrath for acquiescing in the blockade of Gaza and failing to open the Rafah border. Cairo insists that to do so would risk compromising its own security and playing into Israel&apos;s hands by allowing it to evade responsibility for the future of the Palestinian territory. Egypt counters that Assad is being irresponsible in backing Hamas. &quot;The difference between Hamas and Hama is just one letter,&quot; said one Egyptian official, alluding to the infamous massacre of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood at Hama in 1982. &quot;Mubarak may be the only one who can engineer a ceasefire but the Arab street basically agrees with Assad,&quot; said a diplomat based in the region. Criticism of Hamas has focused on its decision not to renew the previous six-month ceasefire with Israel, risking the onslaught that began on 27 December. But there has also been anger at Mahmoud Abbas, the Fatah leader and president of the western-backed Palestinian Authority. Kuwaiti MPs said Abbas would not be welcome at next week&apos;s economic summit due to his &quot;negative attitudes&quot; over the Israeli offensive, complaining he had &quot;obstructed the operations of a legitimate resistance against the aggression on occupied Arab land&quot;. Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, accused Arab leaders of passivity in the face of the crisis. &quot;Unfortunately, some regional, Islamic and Arab states for whatever reason and with a smile of satisfaction, are supporting or tolerating this rare genocide in silence,&quot; Ahmadinejad wrote to Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah. &quot;With God&apos;s help and relying on the Gaza people&apos;s resistance and belief in God, undoubtedly the Zionist regime will fail and will eventually collapse.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-15T14:00:19Z", "title": "Egypt and Saudi Arabia among Arab countries boycotting emergency summit on Israeli offensive in Gaza", "sentences": ["President Bashar al-Assad, Syria&apos;s president, would like to see Egypt and Jordan \u2013 which both have peace treaties with Israel \u2013 at least recall their ambassadors from Tel Aviv in protest at the Gaza offensive."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/15/gaza-egypt-saudi-qatar-summit"}, {"tags": ["Electronic music", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "If you&apos;re seeking an album to keep out the winter chill, you could do worse than to wrap yourself up in Telefon Tel Aviv&apos;s sumptuous head music.

His strength really shocked me. I was gripping his upper arms as tightly as I could to hold him flat on the bed, but he was spitting with rage, tears streaming down his face. I was shouting, &quot;Stop! Please stop!&quot; but he was pushing up at me hard, his face twisting like his body underneath me. He was fighting with everything he had in order to be able to get up, run down the stairs and get out of the house. All I knew at that moment was that I couldn&apos;t let him leave. We were in his bedroom in London and I had just given him the news that his grandmother had been blown to pieces by a rocket in Israel. Jordy had lost his other grandmother five months earlier to cancer. This time there was someone to blame.  Our pain and his rage opened a window up for me on to what is happening in Gaza. There are thousands and thousands of young men who have experienced - or are experiencing - that rage in Gaza and the West Bank, and their fathers and grandfathers have no doubt experienced it too. When I heard in the days that followed Shuli&apos;s death that they handed out sweets in Gaza to celebrate the fact that the rocket had hit a target, I was appalled. Now with all I have seen over the last two weeks in Gaza, part of me feels: why wouldn&apos;t they celebrate?  Shuli, my wife&apos;s mother, lived on Kibbutz Gvar-am, which lies 5km to the north of Gaza and 10km to the south of Ashkelon. She had been the kibbutz nurse until she retired and lately had worked part-time in the kibbutz factory making envelopes for the Salvation Army and Asda. In May last year she had been expecting a visit from a cousin who was over from America. The cousin had phoned to say that she was too frightened to come to Shuli&apos;s kibbutz on account of a rocket landing in Ashkelon the previous day. &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; Shuli told her, &quot;every missile has its own address. We&apos;ll come to you instead.&quot;  An hour later she arrived at the house where her cousin was staying. Her son, Yariv, rang the doorbell and while they waited for someone to answer, Shuli stepped away in order to get some shade next to a wall. The rocket came out of nowhere and she died instantly. None had landed in that area before. Only later did we find out that Shuli had rung her sister the night before her death and made her promise to look after her children if anything were to happen to her. It was beshert - meant to be.  That was six months ago and now, sat at home in north London with the Israeli bombardment of Gaza well into its third week, and with news of fresh horrors arriving daily, our house is filled with a despair of a different kind. It has felt like a house in mourning again. A dark fog which I can&apos;t really describe has enveloped us. Maybe it&apos;s shame. I don&apos;t know. I know we all felt relief that Israel didn&apos;t retaliate after Shuli was killed. But it&apos;s happening now. I keep looking at Shuli&apos;s birth certificate which my wife now has. Shuli&apos;s mother had left Germany by boat for Palestine after Hitler came to power and she helped form a radical socialist community on land partitioned to the Jews by the British. Shuli&apos;s birth certificate states her nationality as Palestinian. Her death certificate said Israeli. My wife says she feels scared and lost and full of guilt. &quot;It&apos;s my country and I see myself as Israeli not Jewish,&quot; she keeps shouting at me. Does that make you feel better or worse about what&apos;s going on, I ask? &quot;That&apos;s worse!&quot; she says, &quot;because Israel is nothing to do with God.&quot; I digest this, but don&apos;t even know where to begin to start unravelling that statement.  I&apos;m trying to think back to Christmas when I was staying on the kibbutz. I&apos;m struggling to remember what I felt as the Hamas rockets were flying in every day during the week before the Israeli F16s screamed over our heads and began pounding the Gaza Strip and those condemned to live within it. My five-year-old son, Geffen, was constantly asking me if he was going to die like his Grandma. People on the kibbutz rallied around as you would expect; it was no time for questions or politics. We didn&apos;t see the bigger picture. But on returning home, I saw it all too clearly, and it sent me into meltdown.  I feel guilty about abandoning my friends on the kibbutz - not physically but mentally. A good friend of mine over there called Mirav, whom I&apos;ve known for 25 years, has a 12-year- old daughter, Omer, who just stays in her room and cries. She&apos;s been doing it for three months now and this all began after the fourth Kasam rocket hit her school. I try to think about her, but shockingly she doesn&apos;t seem to matter so much any more. Not at the moment anyway. Not from here in England with what we&apos;re seeing on television every day. Everything is dwarfed by the horrors in Gaza.  I&apos;d seen the ground troops massing up the road from the kibbutz towards the border with Gaza in the days before I left Israel, but I never believed for one second that they would go in. They did. In the last few days, I&apos;ve stopped watching television and buying newspapers. For the first time in my adult life I don&apos;t want to know what is going on outside my own front door.  Most Israelis I know think Hamas wants to annihilate Israel. A lot of Jews over here think that too. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s what Hamas wants: it depends what you read. I was over there when they blew up buses on Dissenghof Street in Tel Aviv in 1996. That act seemed to turn Israel right wing just at the moment the country was mourning the death of Rabin and was, I believe, genuinely committed to peace. But Hamas is now part of the political process whether Israel, Britain and America likes it or not and dialogue is the only way forward. Would hatred for Israel stop if it were to return to its 1967 borders? Of course not, but Israel has to do it anyway. It has to do the right thing, to help build a strong Palestinian state where people can live normal lives, work, feed their kids, be happy, safe, have dignity. That&apos;s what most people want in life isn&apos;t it?  At Shuli&apos;s funeral last May, her son Jonathon, my brother-in-law, gave a speech. &quot;Where are the doves?&quot; he asked. &quot;What is this land worth without someone with a vision? Nothing. Without doves it wasn&apos;t worth the struggle.&quot; Jonny is 34. He&apos;s an army reservist who is studying to be a neurologist and has a two-year-old son called Boaz. He didn&apos;t scream for blood at his mother&apos;s graveside, he screamed for peace. In our house we have our own thinking to do. My eldest son, Jordy, has Israeli citizenship and in two years he will have to choose either to relinquish that citizenship or to fight in the Israeli army. It can be only his choice.

He was regarded as number three behind the prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, and the party&apos;s political head in Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar.  Siam joined the Gaza Hamas collective leadership in 2004 after Israeli forces killed his mentor, the then Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al Rantissi. He contested Palestine&apos;s 2006 legislative council elections, which were won by Hamas, polling the highest number of votes cast for any candidate.  Duly elected one of eight MPs for Gaza City, he was appointed interior minister and created the executive forces, a cohort of gunmen ostensibly meant to act as auxiliary police. They answered directly to Siam and became a counterweight to the official security force, loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah. &quot;We will beat with an iron fist all groups who are acting illegally,&quot; warned Siam. Their foes in the Fatah-linked Al Aqsa brigade called them &quot;criminals&quot;. Drawn mainly from Hamas militias, their numbers rose from 3,000 to 5,800 by January 2007, and possibly 12,000 today.  Siam helped mastermind the defeat of pro-Fatah units in June 2007 after a four-day uprising that killed at least 116. He had previously promised, just 14 months earlier, that &quot;there will be no armed clash. We&apos;ll settle quarrels through dialogue.&quot; The &quot;coup&quot;, as described by Fatah loyalists, effectively torpedoed the unity government and split the Abbas-controlled regime on the West Bank from the Hamas regime in Gaza.  In November 1995 Siam had told the Israeli daily Ha&apos;aretz: &quot;I don&apos;t hate [Israelis] for being Jewish but because of what they have done to us. If the reason for hate will not exist, [and] you recognise the injustice we suffered ... everything is possible.&quot; A decade later, though, he had solidified into a determined militant. In April 2006 he praised a suicide attack in Tel Aviv - the first after months of truce between the Islamists and Israel - as a justifiable strike against the economic blockade. Interviewed by Italy&apos;s La Repubblica at the time, he proclaimed: &quot;Our people have never had a heavenly life. To us, distress is not something new. They ask us to defend their dignity and their rights, and food will come after.&quot;  Siam preferred polo necks and a neatly trimmed beard over the Arab robes favoured by his colleagues. Later a favoured interlocutor with Iran and Egypt, he was born in Shati refugee camp, Gaza, to a family who hailed from Al-Jura, a now destroyed village west of the Israeli city of Ashkelon. All its Palestinian residents fled when confronted by the Israeli Givati brigade, which conquered the locale in November 1948. Other figures from Al-Jura include the late Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and first leader of Hamas, and the parents of Haniyeh. At first Siam worked as a maths and science teacher at UN-run schools. An early member of Hamas, he headed their teachers union and during the first intifada (1987-1992), he led a unit that killed Palestinians suspected of informing for Israel. In 1992 he was one of 415 Hamas affiliates whom Israel deported to southern Lebanon. On returning to Gaza, he was often arrested by Yasser Arafat&apos;s Palestinian Authority, instituted in 1994. That year he exhorted worshippers at Gaza&apos;s Palestine mosque to put aside differences and unite against Israel. After Hamas won the 2006 elections, some credited Siam with cracking down on rampant clan violence. But he quelled opponents ruthlessly, and human rights agencies highlighted his ministry&apos;s use of torture. Last August, Siam, Zahar and their allies ousted more moderate Haniyeh supporters in internal Hamas elections, suggesting a renaissance for the militants.  Also killed in Thursday&apos;s attack was Siam&apos;s brother Iyad, a controller of Hamas rocket units, one of Siam&apos;s sons, and Salah Abu Sharah, director of Hamas internal security in Gaza. Palestinian sources reported that 20 others were injured.

He was already regarded as the most controversial musician of his day - his string sextet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht (Transfigured Night), had been likened to &quot;a calf with six feet, such as one often sees at a fair&quot; - but the new piece on which he was working would seal his reputation for a century as the composer who, in the words of Julian Lloyd Webber, unleashed &quot;the tyranny of atonality&quot;. Schoenberg was in the midst of a personal catastrophe. He had discovered that his wife, Mathilde, was having an affair and that the object of her affection was their neighbour in Vienna, the expressionist painter Richard Gerstl. Schoenberg&apos;s sense of betrayal must have been all the more acute since it was he who had drawn Gerstl into the family circle, even inviting him to join them when, like many Viennese artists and intellectuals, the Schoenbergs left the city for a summer retreat in the Austrian countryside. When Schoenberg confronted Mathilde she abandoned him and their two small children for Gerstl, only to be persuaded to return home again by Schoenberg&apos;s composition student Anton von Webern. Devastated at losing her, Gerstl set fire to the paintings in his studio, drove a knife into his chest and hanged himself. He was 25. Meanwhile, Schoenberg was working on his new piece, a string quartet, and it was heard for the first time in concert in Vienna on 21 December 1908, just seven weeks after Gerstl&apos;s suicide. Initially, the audience was taken aback by the music&apos;s restraint - &quot;the first movement went tolerably&quot;, wrote one critic - but the second movement was a different matter. Any sense of harmonic security quickly evaporated, and when Schoenberg briefly quoted the nursery rhyme tune &quot;Ach, du lieber Augustin&quot;, its homely familiarity emphasised the strangeness of its new musical setting. During a pause in the music someone sneezed, provoking howls of laughter that temporarily drowned out the instruments. Things got worse in the last two movements. Breaking with 150 years of musical tradition, Schoenberg had decided to add a soprano to the two violins, viola and cello that normally constitute a string quartet. The soprano had been silent for the first two movements of the piece, but as soon as she began to sing in the third movement people started to hiss, and there were shouts of &quot;Stop singing&quot; and &quot;We&apos;ve had enough&quot; before the fourth movement. As another critic described it, the music &quot;could only be played to the close under a bombardment of loud protestation&quot;. In the days and weeks that followed, there was a vitriolic debate in the Viennese newspapers over what became known as the &quot;Schoenberg affair&quot;. Why did this music arouse such hostility? It would be a mistake, perhaps, to dignify these protests with too sophisticated a justification. Every so often audiences seem to need a musical scandal, whether it be an electric Bob Dylan, a woozy Amy Winehouse or a Schoenberg premiere. Yet something unprecedented happened in Vienna that night. Schoenberg began writing his second string quartet in 1907 within the framework of the tonal system, the musical syntax that had been common practice in European art music for at least 200 years; but as the months passed and the music progressed, that syntax ceased to function. To hear the work complete is to hear months of musical and personal crisis compressed into less than half an hour; it as if one could see the transition from representation to abstraction within a single painting. There is an obvious connection between the music and Schoenberg&apos;s emotional turmoil. The text for the third movement, &quot;Litanei&quot;, is a poem by Stefan George. It is a cry for help from a desolate, lost soul, and the music itself seems lost, the instruments wandering aimlessly. Often the music refers back to the melody at the very beginning of the quartet, as if trying to regain some sense of stability but no longer able to sustain it. The climax, on the word Liebe (love), splits the word across the range of the voice, the first syllable on a long, piercing top C, the second spat out on a bottom B. The last movement sets another Stefan George poem, &quot;Entr\u00fcckung&quot;, in which the poet&apos;s spirit is lifted above &quot;strife and tumult&quot;. It begins with the line &quot;Ich f\u00fchle Luft von anderem Planeten&quot; (&quot;I feel air from another planet&quot;) and Schoenberg goes further still into the new musical universe he had discovered beyond the gravitational pull of the tonal system. The music is unearthly, ungrounded, transcendent, its continuity fragmented, moments of radiant calm alternating with obsessive repetitions, quicksilver passagework interspersed between impassioned rhetorical outbursts. &quot;Brutish and bestial&quot; was how Schoenberg described the audience at that cacophonous first night. What is perhaps even more remarkable than the scandal of the &quot;Schoenberg affair&quot; is that this string quartet, born out of the most intense personal trauma, should have exerted such a profound influence over the subsequent evolution of modern music in the 20th century. In the second and third movements, the gradual dissolution of the music&apos;s connection to any secure sense of tonality is a potent expression of Schoenberg&apos;s anguish, and the final movement embraces atonality as a metaphor for a psychological haven beyond suffering. But having entered this new transcendent musical space, Schoenberg was reluctant to return to the old world. Although he would later claim that &quot;there were still many good tunes to be written in C major&quot;, the works that came after the second string quartet continued the exploration of atonality. In the years that followed, he and his disciples refined the language of atonal music and, in the 1920s, codified it as the system of 12-tone composition that became generally known as serialism. Modernity and atonality became synonymous. As the new musical language developed, Schoenberg and his supporters found ways of explaining its evolution, which had more to do with history than domestic conflict. In his 1948 polemic The Philosophy of Modern Music, the German philosopher Theodor Adorno acknowledged that Schoenberg had forged a new aesthetic &quot;in the midst of expressionistic chaos&quot;, but he went to greater lengths to explain how these innovations were the logical development of &quot;the tendencies of Beethoven and Brahms&quot;. Schoenberg, too, preferred to consider his music as the product of historical inevitability. Asked to identify himself during the first world war, he gave his name. &quot;Are you the notorious composer Arnold Schoenberg?&quot; he was asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;somebody had to be.&quot; It was not until 1939 that Schoenberg acknowledged that the &quot;Augustin&quot; tune in the second movement of the second string quartet had &quot;deep emotional significance&quot;. For him, this act of denial was perhaps a necessity. In the aftermath of Gerstl&apos;s suicide, any mention of the traumatic events of 1907-08 was forbidden among Schoenberg&apos;s family and friends, and his state of mind is vividly portrayed in the draft of a &quot;last will and testament&quot; he wrote at the time. Set out in the manner of a Jewish ethical will, it begins with a long explanation of his painfully accumulated self-knowledge. The argument is tortured: &quot;My wife betrayed and lied to the person she thought I was. He was her creation . . . she never saw me, and I never saw her . . . perhaps she never existed at all.&quot;  Atonality and the fragmentation of musical continuity may have become the accepted habits of modern music in the decades after the second string quartet, but they were habits that audiences found easy to resist. There were exceptions - Schoenberg&apos;s pupil Alban Berg enjoyed some success in the 1920s with his opera Wozzeck and some more posthumous success with the violin concerto he completed shortly before his death in 1935. But when the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, their denunciation of atonality as &quot;musical Bolshevism&quot; was in tune with popular sentiment, and not only in Germany and Austria: asked his opinion of Schoenberg by one of his young companions, Benjamin Britten is said to have explained &quot;how dreadful it was&quot;.  After the second world war, this &quot;degenerate&quot; music began to be played again, inspiring a new generation of European composers led by Stockhausen, Boulez and Nono to extend Schoenberg&apos;s technical innovations. But, for these composers, Schoenberg was only a starting point: their radical reconception of the principles of serialism took them far beyond anything Schoenberg had imagined and led in turn to spectacular developments in the use of instruments allied to the new medium of electronic music.  In retrospect, the most striking feature of the postwar period was the way in which Schoenbergian modernism hardened into the dominant orthodoxy of new music. Adorno had argued that Schoenberg was the true musical heir of Beethoven and Brahms, and Adorno&apos;s arguments persuaded generations of composers to adopt the techniques pioneered by Schoenberg. Not to do so was to risk being thought old-fashioned or worse: in The Philosophy of Modern Music, Adorno dismissed Britten and Shostakovich as &quot;feeble&quot; and &quot;impotent&quot;. From Tel Aviv to Toronto, Cambridge to Cape Town, post-Schoenbergian composition became the lingua franca of new music, studied in the academies, commissioned for concert halls and opera houses. Even those composers who chose not to adopt this way of musical speaking could turn its ubiquity to their advantage: composers of bad tonal music explained their lack of success as evidence of institutional prejudice; composers of interesting tonal music (mostly minimalists) could celebrate success achieved in the face of the same prejudice. The result has been a peculiar form of quasi-modern music that still survives today. It has the superficial characteristics of Schoenberg&apos;s version of modernism - angular melodies, uneasy harmonies, abrupt shifts of tone - but, lacking the expressive necessity that propelled Schoenberg towards his new musical language, it has none of the fervent urgency of the second string quartet. This paradoxical music, conservative modernism or modernist conservatism, has its merits. It is often very skilfully made and, for those who acquire the taste, it can seem very tasteful. It sounds like modern music and is assiduously promoted as modern music by much of the classical music industry. Its disadvantage is that, when heard alongside the modernist masterpieces of the first decades of the 20th century, it just sounds vapid and dull. One hundred years after the premiere of the second string quartet, Schoenberg&apos;s musical legacy is a somewhat mixed blessing. His own works, particularly those of the early atonal period, retain the disturbing, kaleidoscopic vision that so upset the Viennese public a century ago. But the subsequent institutionalisation of the techniques he developed in those decisive months has produced hour upon hour of greyness, convincing generations of listeners that new music is always dull and often difficult. Atonal harmony and fragmented melody are still powerful expressive tools, as film composers demonstrate whenever their directors need a musical equivalent for psychological distress, but as the habitual texture of contemporary classical music their routine use has stripped them of meaning. If there is a conclusion to be drawn, it is perhaps that the &quot;air from another planet&quot; needs to be breathed sparingly: it loses its potency the moment we forget the troubled place from where it came. \u2022 Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra will perform Schoenberg&apos;s Gurrelieder at Symphony Hall, Birmingham (0121 780 3333), on 27 February and at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (0871 663 2515), on 28 February.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-17T00:01:00Z", "title": "Arnold Schoenberg: Air from another planet", "sentences": ["From Tel Aviv to Toronto, Cambridge to Cape Town, post-Schoenbergian composition became the lingua franca of new music, studied in the academies, commissioned for concert halls and opera houses."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/17/classical-music-schoenberg"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "World news", "Lebanon", "Iran", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hezbollah"], "article": "As the destruction of Gaza continues, the rockets fired into northern Israel from Lebanon this week have raised fears that the conflict may spread. Attacks like these, accompanied by the confrontational rhetoric of Hezbollah secretary general Hasan Nasrallah, might suggest a readiness to fight. But the Party of God appears to be more reluctant to expand this conflict than they were in 2006.  Two years ago, Hezbollah was enduring political isolation and had less to lose when their efforts to relieve Israel&apos;s bombardments of Gaza erupted into the Second Lebanese War. Today the party has a stake in power in Beirut which it is less willing to jeopardise. Although the longer the conflict continues the harder it will be for Nasrallah to balance the disagreements within his party, as long as he can stay on the sidelines he is inclined to give domestic political concerns temporary precedence over a full-scale war with Israel. Tel Aviv might take note that what is restraining Hezbollah is not so much the might of the Israeli Defence Force, but the impact any conflict would have on its hard-won domestic political power. Hezbollah&apos;s relative restraint has been evident in the limited nature of the latest rocket attacks: sets of two and three Katyushas rather than the barrages of 2006. This, alongside the absence of Hezbollah&apos;s usually proud claim of responsibility, suggests that they were the work of small Palestinian groups such as the PFLP-GC rather than the Party of God. However, little can happen in Southern Lebanon without Hezbollah&apos;s approval, which implies tacit complicity even if the rockets were fired by proxies. Haaretz&apos;s Yoav Stern claims Hezbollah is trying to push the boundaries of what damage Israel will accept without launching a disproportionate retaliation. Yet far from pushing Israel&apos;s boundaries, Hezbollah is pulling off a very delicate balancing act at home. At the moment, the Gaza conflict is increasing Hezbollah&apos;s political capital. Solidarity with the Palestinians, especially with Hamas, is one of his party&apos;s core principles and Nasrallah has enhanced his popularity by launching verbal attacks on both Israel and its Arab allies such as Egypt. With Lebanese elections due in June, these public demonstrations will help boost support from his Shia base. In addition to this, the more Israel&apos;s actions in Gaza appear disproportionate and irrational, the more Hezbollah&apos;s controversial case for retaining its arms on the grounds that they deter the IDF gains credibility in Lebanon.  But having condemned other Arab leaders for their inaction, Hezbollah&apos;s decision to abstain from fighting risks the charge of hypocrisy. Yet to step beyond the rhetoric and launch the kind of attack that could divert Israeli attention from Gaza is highly risky. The Lebanese, even Hezbollah&apos;s loyal southern Shia, are war-weary and only just recovering from the destruction of 2006, and further carnage could cost Nasrallah at the ballot box in May. Furthermore, Hezbollah&apos;s Sunni, Christian and Druze opponents are still resentful about the violent confrontations that led to the Qatar agreement last year \u2013 which delivered Nasrallah and his allies their long-sought, veto-wielding place in government. Should unauthorised Hezbollah attacks engulf them in another unwanted war with Israel, these opponents would surely cancel this truce. The Palestinian rocket attacks, and Hezbollah&apos;s denial of involvement, do not mean that Nasrallah is testing Israel&apos;s patience. Rather, he is doing the very minimum to appear belligerent without risking his delicate position in power. Nonetheless, Nasrallah will come under much more pressure to intervene \u2013 and from Iran, too \u2013 if Hamas looks close to collapse, or if they are forced to accept an unsatisfactory ceasefire. The Party of God is increasingly divided over the right stance to take towards Israel, Iran, and Lebanese politics. Nasrallah is said to favour loosening Hezbollah&apos;s ties with Tehran slightly, preferring a &quot;Lebanon first&quot; approach that would put party&apos;s political programme above its military aims. His deputy Naim Qasim, on the other hand, wants Hezbollah to remain Iran&apos;s proxy against Israel and believes any political involvement should serve the military struggle. If Nasrallah can avoid becoming too involved in Gaza, it could lend weight to his political aims. Intervening could give ground to Iran. Tel Aviv will hope that Nasrallah&apos;s political ambitions trump his deputy&apos;s views. The 2006 war showed that a widely supported grassroots movement like Hezbollah was impossible to destroy militarily. The gradual transformation of the Party of God from an Iranian-controlled militia into an integrated Lebanese political actor that doesn&apos;t want to risk losing power offers more safety to northern Israel than carpet-bombing and phosphorous shells.  The parallels with Hamas are clear. Ceasefire or not, Hamas will survive this campaign. If Hezbollah&apos;s experience in 2006 is anything to go by, its political support will surge after this war, even if the military wing is severely damaged. The long-term answer to rocket attacks is to allow Hamas a legitimate stake in power. Not power seized in a coup that is entrenched by blockade and permanent emergency, but the power denied them by the international community following their election in 2006.  Today, Hamas fights for its survival, and will fire until the last rocket because it has little to lose. Hezbollah has so far exercised restraint in order to hold onto power.

Let&apos;s take Obama at his word that America is engaged in a war on terror. Herein lies a difficulty for the new administration in terms of engaging with the global goodwill that it will undoubtedly enjoy. For while Obama does represent change in domestic terms, his international agenda contains a stronger strand of continuity than change. That is recipe for major disappointment.  On Thursday, David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, gave an erudite and thoughtful speech \u2013 as is his habit \u2013 on why the phraseology of war on terror was a mistake.  Miliband sees the war on terror as too militaristic in tone, too broad a brush when there is in fact a multi-faceted terrorist challenge motivated in many different ways. Are we really talking about the same phenomenon in Mumbai as in Helmand, in London as in Gaza? This Huntington-esque, Manichaean worldview hasn&apos;t really gotten us very far.  As the historian Tony Judt has written, it is rather like lumping together the Italian Red Brigades, the German Baader-Meinhof gang, the Provisional IRA, the Basque ETA, Switzerland&apos;s Jura Separatists and the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica and calling them &quot;European extremism&quot;.  The problem lies in the fact that such simplification still predominates US foreign policy thinking, particularly in public discourse. Initially, the Obama administration will find it difficult to forge a different path. Perhaps all this war on terror rhetoric is just a political cover. As Obama knows more than anyone, words are not just words \u2013 they have a habit of becoming action. Fortunately, we see a more textured strategy when it comes to the new administration&apos;s stance on foreign relations. As Hillary Clinton articulated in her Senate confirmation hearings, the US approach to international affairs will be one of &quot;smart power&quot;. While the genesis of the term is disputed, it is characteristic of the international strategic thinking of Joseph Nye. With a preference for diplomacy and the amplification of power through multilateral relations reinforced by shared values, the US can better achieve its objectives. Military force is always part of the approach in a never-off-the-table kind of way. Smart power is ultimately a hawkish liberal response to neoconservatism. Popular perception and the global media do not slalom around the niceties of international relations theories. So what could this approach mean in practice? On Iran, we can expect progressively bigger sticks and bigger carrots in an effort to dissuade the country from converting its uranium enrichment programme into a deployable nuclear capability. There is likely to be engagement of a serious nature and that will constitute a degree of change. On Iraq, the US has already committed to the full withdrawal of troops by 31 December 2011 and from Iraqi cities, villages and localities by the end of June 2009. Obama may concertina this timetable but we are literally talking about a difference of a few months. Many of these troops will be redeployed in Afghanistan, but it is not difficult to imagine the Bush administration pursuing a similar approach. It is Obama&apos;s approach to the Middle East, most particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that will attract the most initial scrutiny. A collective sigh of disappointment could be heard in the non-Israeli Middle East in response to the fact that Hillary Clinton had appointed Dennis Ross, former Clinton Middle East envoy, as the administration&apos;s most senior Middle East and Iran adviser. Ross was seen during the Camp David negotiations in 2000 to have been consistently and resolutely pro-Israel.  Perhaps Obama will find room for Dan Kurtzer, a former ambassador to both Tel Aviv and Cairo, in his administration. Kurtzer has been a trenchant critic of both the Clinton and Bush administrations&apos; approaches to negotiating a Middle East peace deal. Obama could also go for someone like Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations who has argued for constructive engagement with Iran and even Hamas, should a ceasefire be in place and there be reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority.  Even if Haass or Kurtzer are brought in to balance the Ross approach, any change is likely to be incremental. Obama has consistently articulated a strongly pro-Israel line. If the world it is waiting for seismic and immediate change, it will be sorely disappointed. None of this means that we are simply facing an extension of the status quo. Changes will be nuanced, subtle and will emerge over time. Like a seasoned diplomat, the world will just have to be patient to see what this incrementalism will mean in practice. As Obama re-reads previous inauguration speeches, a line from John F Kennedy&apos;s speech in 1961 is certain to catch his eye. In a grammatical inversion typically used by Kennedy to emphasise his point, he says: &quot;We should never negotiate out of fear. But we should never fear to negotiate.&quot; While the content of the Obama foreign policy will mark a continuity of the Bush administration, this Kennedy-esque style will induce change. In practical terms, that could mark the difference between success and the type of failure that we have become far too used to in recent years.  Continuity or change will seem rather academic next to the US becoming a clear force for good in the world. Success or failure in that regard will be the ultimate test of the Obama administration. For now, we will just have to watch and wait. So at least there is now hope where before there was little.

You know what the results would be.&quot; And then it signed off, in case the listener had any doubt. &quot;This is the State of Israel!&quot; We do indeed know what the results would be. In 2006, more than 1,000 people died in Lebanon, the vast majority of them civilians, when Israel launched air and artillery attacks against targets including Beirut airport, bridges and highways, and established an air, land and sea blockade following Hezbollah&apos;s capture of two Israeli soldiers from the Israeli side of the border. War crimes were committed and there has been no accountability, making the next war that much easier. In Gaza so far, more than 1,200 Palestinians have died (and 13 Israelis), the vast majority of whom were non-combatants. A quarter were children, straining even Israel&apos;s definition of &quot;terrorist&quot; as, according to its own experts, it expands the definition of &quot;legitimate target&quot; and, in so doing, narrows the definition of &quot;collateral damage&quot;. As jurist Amos Guiora, who served as a military lawyer in Israel for 19 years, has said: &quot;Israel declared war on an organisation, and by extension on all those involved in that organization \u2013 active and passive alike. (The italics are mine.) This is how Operation Cast Lead is different from all previous Israeli operations.&quot; Senior IDF officers have already warned that the &quot;third Lebanon war&quot; will be in the same vein: more &quot;disproportionate&quot; than the second was. A heavily rearmed Hezbollah will not be the main target. Maj Gen Giora Eiland, former head of the National Security Council, has gone as far as to say that Israel failed in 2006 because it fought the wrong enemy \u2013 Hezbollah rather than Lebanon itself. &quot;The only good thing that happened in the last war was the relative damage caused to Lebanon&apos;s population,&quot; he said. &quot;The destruction of thousands of homes of &apos;innocents&apos; preserved some of Israel&apos;s deterrent power. The only way to prevent another war is to make it clear that should one break out, Lebanon may be razed to the ground.&quot; In a &quot;background paper&quot; on &quot;issues of proportionality&quot; drawn up in December 2008, in the countdown to the Gaza offensive, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that &quot;the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) makes strenuous efforts to give advance notice to the civilian population in the middle of military targets, including places used by terrorists for storing weapons and launching attacks, so that they have an opportunity to leave the area.&quot; How hollow this rings as Gaza runs with blood, and how untrue. Operation Cast Lead was unleashed, without warning, at 11.30am, when urban areas of Gaza are at their most crowded and children compelled to attend school in shifts because of the scarcity of educational resources are on the move. Would anyone with even a scrap of humanity call hundreds of dead, not to mention thousands of wounded, maimed and traumatised, &quot;effective&quot; humanitarian planning? The pain of those Israelis who oppose this horrific onslaught is as palpable as that of the Palestinians trapped in Gaza. &quot;We are darkening the world of a million and a half human beings and destroying it,&quot; columnist Yossi Sarid wrote in Ha&apos;aretz. &quot;We are dropping featherweight notices and a ton of a bomb ... The begetter of all this will no longer boast of the-most-moral-army-in-the-world.&quot; Lebanon grew used to featherweight notices and pre-recorded phone calls in 2006. The calls came at all hours of night and day, to all communities. Some said, &quot;We mean you no harm.&quot; Others were threatening: &quot;Keep away from areas where Hezbollah men live and work.&quot; &quot;Terror by telephone,&quot; a friend called it.  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also telephoned in 2006, according to Ha&apos;aretz, and told: &quot;Welcome, you and your family are requested to leave home because the IDF intends to attack it. The house is used to hide warfare or terrorists.&quot; Welcome? How bizarre is that? But no one bothered to drop leaflets on the two pick-ups packed with people fleeing from the Lebanese village of Marwaheen near the Israeli border, on Israeli orders. Had they done so, 23 people might not have died in a single, heart-stopping moment \u2013 one of them a child who was found, lifeless, still clutching a half-eaten sandwich. No one bothered to telephone the ambulance driver whose vehicle was hit on a bridge outside Sidon, leaving a female passenger dead and three paramedics wounded, one of whom lost both feet. The phone calls from south of the border tapered off after the war but did not stop completely. Lebanese were occasionally still woken in the night by unfamiliar voices requesting that they telephone a number in London if they &quot;know where the fighters are&quot;. But in the last week, the pre-recorded message department of the Israeli military has been gearing up again, threatening people apparently selected at random after Katyusha rockets were fired across the Lebanon-Israel border on two consecutive days, killing no one. Hezbollah has said it had nothing to do with either incident, and Tel Aviv initially blamed Palestinians. But within days Ha&apos;aretz ran an article claiming that Hezbollah was trying &quot;to alter the balance of power that has existed between the militant organization and Israel since the second Lebanon war&quot;. Even if the rockets weren&apos;t Hezbollah&apos;s, it said, &quot;it is clear that little happens in southern Lebanon without being coordinated in advance with Hezbollah.&quot; When, it asked, &quot;will Hezbollah have a better opportunity to change the regional rules of the game than it does now, during Israel&apos;s offensive against Hamas in Gaza, when cross-border fire receives greater legitimacy than during quiet times?&quot; Most Lebanese analysts disagree: the Lebanese are due to vote in general elections in June, and Hezbollah and its allies have a strong chance of forming a parliamentary majority. Bringing new destruction down on the country would not be conducive to that end. In 2006, Israeli planes bombed a mosque in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Israeli intelligence sources claimed the mosque had seven basements and had been &quot;built by Iranian engineers who specialised in the construction of protected subterranean building for their country&apos;s nuclear facilities&quot;. They said Hezbollah had sealed off the area and no one could approach it. Top Hezbollah leaders had died in the attack and the party wouldn&apos;t be able to deny it for ever. Wrong, on all counts.  I biked to the mosque within minutes of the bombardment without encountering one Hezbollah checkpoint and was able to examine it at leisure, without interruption. It had one basement \u2013 not seven \u2013 and that contained only copies of the Qur&apos;an and prayer mats. Not a single member of Hezbollah had been killed there, far less any notable.  So, next time Ain Mreisse is targeted by telephone, I&apos;d be very obliged if the call centre in Tel Aviv would play the message which gives that London number. I&apos;d be happy to tell them there are no terrorists in my area, and I want it on record.

Here was a perfectly politically correct chamber group to usher in the inaugural address: African-American Anthony McGill played the clarinet; French-born Chinese-American Yo-Yo Ma took the cello part; and Itzhak Perlman, born in Tel Aviv, was the violinist. At the piano was Gabriela Montero, who lives in the US, but is a celebrity in her native Venezuela.  The music? Air and Simple Gifts by John Williams, the composer of a myriad film scores from Star Wars to Schindler&apos;s List. The work is based on the same humble Shaker hymn that Copland quoted in his ballet Appalachian Spring, a melody so American as to be almost a cliche. The sweet and yearning strains of Williams&apos;s piece was an apt introduction to the president&apos;s address. As a performer, Obama has in the past done rousing and energetically inspiring; he has kicked back and become the cheery anecdotalist and joker. But even in his speech on race relations in Philadelphia this March, he did not take a tone so sombre and sober as to compare with the almost funereal delivery of his inaugural speech.  The president barely smiled - he had kept his expression darkly checked as he emerged into the light of the Capitol steps \u2013 and his deep seriousness was somewhat at odds with the flamboyance of the costume department, which had tricked out the women of his family in a rainbow of pink and orange, of fuchsia and blue, and of glimmering lime. Obama&apos;s performance was more suitably matched with George Bush&apos;s costume of the day \u2013 a black overcoat mournfully matched with a black scarf.  The most striking recurring imagery of the speech \u2013 which was always going to be a finely wrought literary creation \u2013 was of bleak weather. Obama talked of &quot;gathering clouds and raging storms&quot;, of &quot;icy currents&quot;, of &quot;snow stained with blood&quot;, and used a near-Shakespeare quote, &quot;winter of our hardship&quot;. His delivery was wintry, too \u2013 there was none of the rabble-rousing, preacher-man effervescence that he can summon up on occasion. Nor, significantly, did he spill out lines (such as his famous &quot;Yes we can&quot;) that demanded an audience&apos;s vocal response; or deal in self-consciously memorable soundbites (there was no equivalent here of Kennedy&apos;s &quot;ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country&quot;). It was time to set aside childish things, he said, and this was a grown-up piece of speaking, consciously recalling Roosevelt&apos;s inaugural address, and designed to apotheosise him from folksy people&apos;s friend to tough leader of men \u2013 and the delivery of which was at its most animated and arresting when he promised America&apos;s enemies: &quot;You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.&quot; In short, a performance virtuosic in its magisterial gloom.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-20T20:11:29Z", "title": "Obama inauguration: President delivers wintry performance", "sentences": ["Here was a perfectly politically correct chamber group to usher in the inaugural address: African-American Anthony McGill played the clarinet; French-born Chinese-American Yo-Yo Ma took the cello part; and Itzhak Perlman, born in Tel Aviv, was the violinist."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-music-speech"}, {"tags": ["Student politics", "King's College London", "Students", "Higher education", "UK news", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Shimon Peres"], "article": "Students at King&apos;s College London are staging a sit-in protest on campus over the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the honorary doctorate bestowed on the Israeli president, Shimon Peres. In the latest of a flurry of occupations at English universities in response to Israel&apos;s actions in Gaza, more than 100 students took over a lecture theatre in the university yesterday. Kings students are demanding that the university issue a formal statement condemning Israel&apos;s bombing of Gaza and revoke the honorary doctorate Peres was awarded in November last year. The protesters also want King&apos;s, and its vice-chancellor, Rick Trainor, to provide five fully funded scholarships for Palestinian students, help organise a cross-campus fundraising day, establish links with educational institutions in Gaza, and donate any surplus educational resources to them. In addition, they are calling for King&apos;s to publish a list of any links it has with the arms trade. In a statement, the students said: &quot;We stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza and refuse to let our university, one which we are very proud of being a part of, award a doctorate to a man who has not only been an advocate of the recent brutality in Gaza, but also a protagonist in the history of bloodshed that has scarred the Middle East.&quot; They added: &quot;It is important to note that there have not been university occupations like this since the anti-apartheid movement in the 1980s.&quot; Erin O&apos;Byrne, a first-year law student, said: &quot;It&apos;s disgraceful that Shimon Peres was given an honorary doctorate. None of us think that can be done in our name. &quot;There&apos;s usually a lot of apathy among students especially in King&apos;s, which is quite conservative, but the humanitarian crisis in December pushed people into doing something now.&quot; She said the university was allowing the protest but ignoring the students&apos; demands. King&apos;s said Peres&apos;s doctorate was in recognition of his past efforts to find a peaceful solution to conflicts in the Middle East, and there were no plans to take the &quot;unprecedented action of revoking the award&quot;. A spokeswoman said the university&apos;s senior officers understood the reason behind the protest. It would make no formal statement, but concurred with a statement made by Trainor on behalf of the vice-chancellors&apos; group, Universities UK (UUK). Trainor, UUK&apos;s president, said: &quot;UUK supports calls for an end to the conflict in and beyond Gaza. We are particularly aware that many of the civilian casualties have occurred in educational establishments. &quot;The UK&apos;s universities are resolutely committed to the right to education, enshrined in the UN universal declaration of human rights. Higher education, in particular, is a global activity and we value our academic links with universities all over the world. &quot;The international nature of higher education means it is a force for understanding, tolerance and respect between peoples.&quot; Over the last week, students have held occupations in five other universities: the School of Oriental and African Studies, the London School of Economics, Essex, Birmingham and Sussex. The director of Soas, Paul Webley, said it would be &quot;inappropriate for the school to make any overtly political statement as an institution&quot;. In a further indication of rising tensions on campus, a campaigning group against antisemitism, Engage, has claimed that students and lecturers at Soas have been trying to cancel a series of lectures on Tel Aviv at 100 by Prof Colin Shindler. It said Shindler, professor of Israel studies at Soas, had been bombarded with &quot;highly aggressive, vituperative emails&quot; from many people, but most worryingly from his academic colleagues and fellow members of the University and College Union. In a letter to staff, Shindler said it was &quot;terribly unfortunate&quot; that the timing of the lecture series had coincided with the situation in Gaza. &quot;Any call for cancelling this series will be seen as not based on opposition to the centenary, but on the participation of Israeli academics; a resurrection of the attempt to boycott academics simply because they are Israeli regardless of their opinion about the tragedy in Gaza. Soas as an institution and the British government have always strongly opposed and condemned such a boycott,&quot; he said. &quot;Academic institutions rightly do not suppress different narratives and different opinions.&quot; Adam Pike, national chairman of the Union of Jewish Students, said: &quot;The recent protests, which have been met with widespread derision from students, have served only to inflame tensions and increase intimidation. &quot;UJS is really concerned about the creation of an unsafe atmosphere for Jewish students at university and, while we will do all we can to support our students, we expect the leadership of the higher education sector to do all in their power as well. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t let political fringe groups determine the kind of university experience that all students, including Jewish ones, have while on campus. The rising levels of antisemitic incidents across the UK should be a cause for concern for everyone.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-21T13:06:35Z", "title": "King's students stage sit-in over Gaza", "sentences": ["In a further indication of rising tensions on campus, a campaigning group against antisemitism, Engage, has claimed that students and lecturers at Soas have been trying to cancel a series of lectures on Tel Aviv at 100 by Prof Colin Shindler."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/21/kingscollegelondon-gaza-protest"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Protest", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Last week, at the height of Operation Cast Lead, a group of Israeli firemen threw their hats into the political ring, albeit in somewhat undiplomatic and uncivilised fashion. During a peaceful anti-war vigil outside a Tel Aviv air force base, several members of the fire brigade turned on one protester, drenching her relentlessly with water from their hoses, before approaching her and ordering her into the station in order to &quot;give us all head&quot;.  Their actions were, while wholly illegal, none the less emblematic of a massive shift in Israeli public opinion over the last few years, according to Sharon Dolev, the woman on the receiving end of the assault. A veteran activist, Dolev has suffered a great deal during her 20 years of campaigning in the Israeli peace camp (&quot;death threats, being shot with rubber bullets, hate mail, beatings&quot;), but said that this incident was &quot;the first time that the establishment felt safe in [taking action such as this]&quot;.  &quot;It used to be a big deal if bus drivers criticised protests and vigils in public,&quot; she recalls, &quot;since as employees of the state, they were not allowed to express political opinions in uniform.&quot; Now, however, the firemen felt so secure of escaping punishment that they even bombarded her with firecrackers during the attack, telling her &quot;now you know what it&apos;s like to live in Sderot&quot;.  When video evidence emerged on an Israeli news website of her ordeal, readers&apos; comments were predictably scathing of Dolev and her fellow protestors for daring to speak out in the first place against the IDF&apos;s operation. &quot;Of the 380 comments, all but 10 were in support of the fire brigade,&quot; said Dolev. &quot;Some readers even called openly for our murder, urging the police to shoot us, or saying &apos;Why use water \u2013 use acid instead&apos;.&quot; In her view, the inexorable shift of the Israeli public towards out and out hostility and hyper-defensiveness was inevitable from as far back as 1967, when the West Bank was first conquered. &quot;We used to hold signs at protests reading &apos;The occupation will corrupt&apos;,&quot; she told me. &quot;Now, we can see that it has [come to pass]. As a society, we have lost our ability to see clearly; we have let fear blind us. Once, calling someone a racist was the harshest accusation you could make. Later, you began to hear people say &apos;I know I&apos;m a racist, but...&apos;; nowadays [during Cast Lead], we heard &apos;I know I&apos;m talking like a Nazi, but at least the Nazis knew how to deal with their enemies&apos;.&quot; Despite others employing Nazi comparisons to describe Israeli military actions, Dolev isn&apos;t comfortable with such terminology herself, not least because it derails the debate about the issues at hand. &quot;It&apos;s all too easy for the Israeli authorities to say &apos;we didn&apos;t build an Auschwitz for the Palestinians, so everything&apos;s ok&apos;, but in reality everything is not ok.&quot; She believes that history has come full circle, and that instead of learning the lessons of the Holocaust, &quot;we have become the racists ourselves&quot;.  &quot;Isn&apos;t Gaza a ghetto?&quot; she continues. &quot;OK, we don&apos;t use the Palestinians&apos; hair for cushions, but the [stage is being set for the] same kind of process of dehumanisation here.&quot; Working in a joint Israeli-Palestinian organisation in Gaza in 1989 gave Dolev her first exposure to &quot;the banality of evil&quot;, she says. &quot;It wasn&apos;t seeing a soldier get scared and shoot into a crowd, but rather seeing a girl sitting in her house and getting shot by a stray bullet. And then, when she needed to be transferred to a Cairo hospital, the Shabak officers saying only she could cross, and no one else. A 12-year-old girl, in a vegetative state, and they wouldn&apos;t even let her mother accompany her. That is the banality of evil.&quot;  In her eyes, the Israeli public has allowed its leaders and military to get away with such punitive measures simply because they have allowed fear to override all other emotions: &quot;Fear turns us into beasts,&quot; she says flatly. &quot;I remember in my first week at school, aged six, we were taught how to blockade the classroom in case a terrorist got into the playground. While some fear is justified, there is not enough reason to make the public terrified on a daily basis.&quot; The media are just as responsible as the government for perpetually scaring ordinary Israelis, she believes. &quot;Fear sells papers,&quot; she says cynically.  Such defensiveness allowed the police to get away with imprisoning some 700 activists over the course of Operation Cast Lead, she believes; many on the most spurious of charges. &quot;They arrested some on the charge of disturbing public order, others on even vaguer charges. And some were even detained for &apos;damaging the nation&apos;s morale&apos; \u2013 a charge which doesn&apos;t even exist [in the statutes]. There is no law in Israel anymore.&quot;  As well as her experience at the hands of the fire brigade, Dolev also points to the kind of sloganeering in the election campaign as proof that the bedrock of democracy on which Israel is founded is beginning to look far less solid. &quot;When you have Lieberman declaring &apos;No loyalty, no citizenship&apos;, you start to worry about what point we&apos;ve come to.&quot; However, she is undeterred in her struggle on behalf of the peace camp, believing that hope is not lost in terms of convincing the Israeli public of an alternative to perpetual war and aggression. A firm promoter of the Arab Peace Initiative, she is convinced that the proposal is the best way to resolve the decades-old conflict.  &quot;It&apos;s the biggest carrot ever offered to the Israeli people,&quot; she says. &quot;One-state or two-state is a non-issue; whatever the two peoples agree on I would take with both hands. All that matters is that there are borders, and that those living within the borders are given full rights and citizenship. However, I worry about [Israeli Jews] becoming a minority, because after all we&apos;ve taught them over 60 years of how to treat minorities, it&apos;s become dangerous to be a minority ourselves ... &quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-21T14:46:19Z", "title": "Seth Freedman: Firefighters turned their hoses on a peaceful anti-war protester last week.

Carrie Cracknell&apos;s production of Dolls also looks unmissable at Tramway. Cracknell, by the way, is one of the short-listed finalists for the \u00a310,000 Arts Foundation award, the winner of which which will be announced on Wednesday. The other females on the list are Maria Aberg, Clare Lizzimore and Sarah Tipple. The only male nominated is Tassos Stevens, whose extraordinary piece of game theatre, Small Town Anywhere, will get a major run at BAC in the autumn.  Talking of BAC, those of you living in London will be pleased to hear that Kneehigh&apos;s Don John is coming to the arts centre in April. Of course, you can still see it next week at Northern Stage in Newcastle. Remember, too, that the Brief Encounter regional tour begins at the Theatre Royal Northampton in early February. Back in Scotland, the Traverse is playing host this weekend to New Year, New Futures, a series of staged readings of new work, while at Tramway, Rob Evan&apos;s Naked Neighbour (Twitching Blind) sounds promising. The Tron has Matthew Zajac&apos;s storytelling solo, The Tailor of Inverness, about his father&apos;s escape from Nazi tyranny and is directed by Grid Iron&apos;s Ben Harrison. It has has just been announced that Harrison will also be directing a new version of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in the summer.

Do it, because otherwise we may end up with something we don&apos;t want. Oh, and put 7 Feb in your diary because it is Mary Neal day. Who was she? A woman who at the turn of the last century was behind the English folk song and dance revival of the period, but who seems to have been written out of folk dancing history. Former Lift director, Lucy Neal, will be celebrating her great, great aunt. Lift has seemed rather lost since Neal and Rose Fenton left, and the hasty departure of director Anghared Rees suggested that the writing was on the wall for the festival. But, I reckon it could well come back from the brink and with renewed vigour under the leadership of new director Mark Ball, who did wonders at Fierce. Other things worth a look include Innit, the Urban Musical at the Lowry in Manchester, Gargarin Way at the Ustinov in Bath, mask and puppet show Cat and Mouse at the Belgrade in Coventry, and the fantastic Pandora 88 at the North Wall in Oxford. Major London productions include Be Near Me at the Donmar, and Samuel Adamson&apos;s Mrs Affleck which opens at the National on Tuesday. Spring Awakening is in preview at the Lyric Hammersmith, while Resolution continues at the Place. There&apos;s an interesting programme too at Shunt, which includes the showing of a piece by Marc von Henning, who some of you may remember from Primitive Science.

On the one side, Palestinian bitterness about the heavy toll suffered in Israel&apos;s onslaught will not quickly be assuaged or forgiven. On the other side, Israeli mistrust about Palestinian intentions, exemplified by Hamas&apos;s indiscriminate firing of thousands of missiles at civilians and its dedication to destroy Israel, will not easily be stilled. Yet President Obama has moved swiftly and has appointed George Mitchell as his special peace envoy. It remains to be seen how far the United States will be willing to go in ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: whether it will rely on words and persuasion, or use muscle in applying pressure. And the extent to which it stays the course will depend on success in dealing with US priorities \u2013 the economy, Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran. Mitchell flies in on Wednesday and starts with the advantage that the end goal is known and widely accepted: a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine as friendly neighbours, and Israel accepted by all or most Arab states. The framework is also known: the end of Israel&apos;s occupation of the West Bank and the opening of the Gaza Strip; agreement on borders and withdrawal of all or some settlements, or compensatory land swaps; resolution of the refugee issue; Jerusalem as a shared capital; shared control of the Holy Basin.  Much discussion has gone into these issues, at Camp David, in the Clinton Parameters, at Taba and the Wye Plantation, in the Road Map, at Annapolis. Inasmuch as details are known, agreement between Israelis and Palestinians has been reached to varying extents. How will Mitchell approach his task? Will he bring Israelis and Palestinians into discussions in the hope that they will negotiate a final accord? Another way is to go to the basics and satisfy the question: what does each side need?  Israel is the strong party in the conflict. But even with its military might and economic power, it has a deep-rooted existential fear that must be met. It is also supposed to have morality, springing out of the Judaism that underpins the existence of the Jewish state. Plus Jewish sensitivity to persecution, derived from centuries of terrible historical experience, magnified by the Holocaust, and brought into the present by unceasing Arab hostility since the state was founded in 1948. The historically created anxiety about continued existence is not always a force for good: Israeli destructiveness hurts others and contradicts the state&apos;s sense of moral purpose. The drive for survival pushed Israel into a pre-emptive strike against Arab neighbours in 1967. Unexpected victory led to hubris and later the growth of religious messianism. That was aided and abetted by the declaration by Arab states in Khartoum in September that year: no peace with Israel, no recognition, no negotiations. That hardened Israeli attitudes. The consequences of 1967 are seen today in the continuing occupation of the West Bank, with nearly 300,000 Israelis in settlements and another 200,000 in suburbs built to extend Jerusalem. The settlers have permeated government, in the civil service and the army, and enjoy influence out of proportion to their numbers. The deceptions and illegal channelling of government funds for their cause are well-documented. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, promised to curb settler expansion, but did very, very little. There has been no action even towards the more modest goal of evacuating the 80,000 settlers in 80 settlements beyond the new security barrier. So much land has now been seized from the intended Palestinian state, so many settlements and roads have been built, that the possibility of two states is being questioned. Some say that the point of no return has already been passed. Others argue that it must be possible because it must be. (On the face of it, a one-state solution is the natural goal. Jews and Arabs live in the same tiny part of the world, and universal values point to a single, shared state where people will live happily together. Unfortunately, it does not stand up to scrutiny: first, the vast majority of Israel&apos;s 6 million Jews will not agree to it now or in the foreseeable future. Who will force them to enter into an arrangement that they see as the death-knell of their existence? Second, a single state is not remotely a practical possibility for the foreseeable future given the intense fear, hatred and prejudice that divide the two peoples. It is fantasy to believe that they can be persuaded to live together. A loose confederation between Israel and Palestine, based on shared economic interests, with Jordan joining in, is a possibility. With time, if trust develops, it could grow deeper. But that&apos;s another story.) Tell Israelis that there must be a Palestinian state on the West Bank and, while opinion polls show majority agreement, many will worriedly say that Palestinians cannot be trusted and it would be foolhardy to allow them within missile range of Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport. In evidence, they will point to Gaza, which Israel quit in 2005 only to be pursued by thousands of missiles. Respond that Israel did not really quit but kept Gazans locked inside and you will be told that Palestinians had the chance of creating something \u2013 as with the prosperous greenhouses and the buildings they took over from settlers, but chose instead to plunder them and give violent vent to their hatred of Jews.  Trust is impossible in this cycle of accusation and counter-accusation. Yet trust is needed for Israel to end the occupation of the West Bank and allow Gaza to breathe. The end of occupation will not in itself bring peace, but it is the crucial first step to make all else possible. How to get Israel to take the first step? Palestinians have to convince them that mass murder does not await them and that their Jewish state is secure. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, representing the mainstream, has already made a mighty and painful compromise in acknowledging the reality of Israel inside the 1967 borders. It has also turned away from suicide bombings, which did so much during the second intifada to drive most Israelis to the right and reject any notion of achieving peace with Palestinians. The world has to be intelligent and understanding in persuading or pushing Israel to change its ways. If it commits human rights abuses, it must be as subject to international condemnation as any other nation; but singling it out as the singular source of evil is so bizarre and contrary to truth that it achieves nothing except anger and derision. The yelling and accusing and boycotts are counterproductive because they only entrench Israeli beliefs that they are the victims of prejudice and hypocrisy; rather try to pledge security and safety.  For Palestinians, the imperative need is the end of occupation so that they can have freedom, the right to govern themselves, the right to a life of dignity, security and economic empowerment. The Palestinian Authority must have continued support in developing effective and corruption-free government, so that it can show its people that it can produce peace dividends for them. Palestinians also have to reach accord among themselves to bring both Fatah and Hamas into government. As matters stand at present, Israel, the US and the EU demand that Hamas accept Israel&apos;s existence, that it forswears violence and endorse previous treaties agreed by the Palestinian Authority. Is it able to do this? Will its Islamist ideology, bedded on hatred of Jews and the Jewish state, permit it? Will Iran, its patron and arms supplier, intent on its own power-seeking agenda in the region, allow it? If these anxious questions cannot be resolved, uncertainty and instability will continue, with the ever-present danger of missile attacks by Hamas and the inevitability of Israeli counter-attacks. The civilians on both sides of the border will continue to be victims of violence. Some argue, however, for another approach: the reality of Hamas cannot be denied and it must be part of the solution; further, that Hamas cannot be forced into meeting the recognition and other demands; instead, Israel must seek to make contact, however informally, to achieve at least a de facto relationship, in the hope that, over time, Hamas will be nudged into accepting the reality of the Jewish state. Contact, invaluable in itself, will also help to overcome Sharon&apos;s blunder in 2005 in withdrawing unilaterally from Gaza and ignoring the common-sense need to deal with Palestinians as partners on shared practicalities such as border access and health control.  Whether the hardliners inside Hamas will agree to any contact with Israel is unknown. But the only way to find out is to try it, is the argument. As for worry that giving Hamas status will undermine Fatah, that can be met by Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and ensuring that Fatah is enabled to run a genuine government. These are the strands that George Mitchell will be picking up. He can also turn to the Arab Peace Initiative: Sharon brushed it aside when the &quot;land for peace&quot; offer was first announced in 2002. Olmert has been more encouraging, but, astonishingly, it seems that no practical steps have yet been taken to talk to the Arab states to find out what devil might lie in the details or what compromises might be possible. Whatever President Obama, via Mitchell, does or doesn&apos;t do, he cannot impose a whole new order. Ultimately, the solutions are in the hands of Israelis and Palestinians. Both sides need leaders whose vision of the future, and fear of sliding into catastrophe, will cause them to lead their people towards mutual acceptance and peace. For Israel, might such a leader possibly emerge from the general election on February 10?", "publicationDate": "2009-01-26T20:00:11Z", "title": "Benjamin Pogrund: Whatever President Obama, via George Mitchell, does or doesn't do, he cannot impose a whole new order in the Middle East", "sentences": ["Tell Israelis that there must be a Palestinian state on the West Bank and, while opinion polls show majority agreement, many will worriedly say that Palestinians cannot be trusted and it would be foolhardy to allow them within missile range of Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/26/barack-obama-george-mitchell-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "European Union", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Shortly after I became a European commissioner in 1999 I visited Gaza and the West Bank to see how the European commission, under strong international pressure, could speed up disbursement of development assistance. I recall in particular visits to Gaza airport, subsequently ploughed up by the Israeli army, and to a general hospital. I visited the morgue that was under construction. It must have been badly overloaded in recent years. After the second intifada began in the autumn of 2000, Israel stopped the transfer of tax receipts owed to the Palestinian Authority. In the following summer the commission began payment of direct budgetary assistance to the authority. There were tough conditions, overseen by international financial institutions. The infrastructure built by European money on the West Bank and in Gaza was systematically trashed by the Israeli Defence Forces in 2002. They were responding to horrific suicide bombings in Israel. Anything that might be seen to provide the sinews of government was destroyed - including the land registry, courts and police stations. This did not obviously advance the prospect of a two-state solution. Throughout the period when budgetary support was provided, the European commission was accused by some Israeli lobby groups of bankrolling terrorism and corruption. We just about achieved our aim and managed to keep the Palestinian Authority afloat - even to reform it. As the responsible commissioner, I was privately encouraged by senior US state department officials to continue the support, and was never asked by Israeli officials to stop it. Europe was in effect fulfilling its now historic role of financing the terrible failure of policies laid down not in Brussels, but in Tel Aviv and Washington. Doubtless Europe is getting ready to do the same again. From 2000 to 2008, European commission funding to Palestine totalled nearly \u20ac3bn. In the last couple of years, about half the funding went to Gaza, for example in fuel for the power plant and help for impoverished families. Over the last 10 years about \u20ac50m has been spent in Gaza on physical infrastructure work, part of a much larger sum committed but not spent. To all these figures should be added the development assistance paid for directly by member states. After the recent assault on Gaza, the collecting tin is once again being passed round. Leaving to one side the controversy over the BBC&apos;s lamentable failure to air the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, on a state and European level we should be generous in giving humanitarian relief. But it is worth questioning the point of further development assistance in the absence of political progress. With no political movement, and with a ban on any contact at all with Hamas, Tony Blair&apos;s purported role as Palestine&apos;s George Marshall - bringing peace through development - has been totally irrelevant. Forgive the question, but isn&apos;t this the same Tony Blair who rightly used to talk to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness in the pursuit of peace; the same Tony Blair who released terrorist murderers from prison in the same cause? If Europe is to write more cheques, surely we should insist on some political movement. The first step would be to respond positively to the call from Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, for the formation of a unity government. There was one after Hamas won a majority of seats in the 2006 parliamentary elections. After active diplomatic efforts by Saudi Arabia, Hamas and Fatah were locked into an uneasy truce which was split asunder in part by the US and European refusal to deal with Hamas. Presumably any unity government formed today would require another Fatah-Hamas deal, brokered by Arab governments. But would the world then deal with the government that emerged? Without Hamas, how would any peace deal be sold to the Palestinians? The diplomatic trick is not how to justify the isolation of Hamas but how to ease them out of their isolation, to get them to endorse a permanent ceasefire, and to release captive Corporal Shalit. Progress also requires recognition of the way that all the dots join up in the Middle East. Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Hezbollah will all be part of any hopeful way forward. Washington needs to talk to Iran and to engage Syria. It should also encourage the diplomacy of Turkey and Qatar, which have become increasingly helpful in recent months. So much of the focus in the Middle East is on process. We should go back and look at the content of a deal to produce lasting peace and security for Israel and a viable Palestinian state. There will be no resolution while there are so many Israeli settlements on the West Bank. Will the Obama administration say that loud and clear to Israeli politicians? Before Europe does the easy bit - even in these financially straitened times - and writes more cheques, we should at least ask ourselves what exactly we are buying with our money. It would be a real breakthrough if the answer was peace. \u2022 Chris Patten, a former Conservative party chairman and European commissioner for external relations, is chancellor of the University of Oxford", "publicationDate": "2009-01-27T00:01:00Z", "title": "Chris Patten: Writing cheques for Gaza is easy.

With Israel&apos;s 10 February election just over a week away, opinion polls and analysts say that the two principal government parties, Kadima and Labour, have extracted little benefit from the three-week Gaza war. That much was underscored yesterday when at least 10 rockets were fired into Israel, injuring three and drawing ominous promises of retaliation from the government. Hamas has not taken responsibility for the new attacks, some of which have been claimed by smaller groups. But Israel says it holds Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since seizing power in June 2007, responsible for all attacks coming from the territory. Israel retaliated by bombing three targets in Gaza last night after the government threatened &quot;harsh and disproportionate&quot; action as it scrambled to stop Palestinian rocket fire and to check the rise of its right-wing rival, Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party. Israeli warplanes struck after the military said had it called Gazan residents on their mobile phones to play a recorded message warning those who live near weapons tunnels or store houses to evacuate their homes immediately. The military said its warplanes hit a Hamas outpost and six smuggling tunnels in Rafah, along the Egyptian border.  Despite a war that left 1,300 Palestinians dead and reduced much of Gaza to rubble, the coalition headed by Kadima party leader, Tzipi Livni and the Labour party chief Ehud Barak, has failed to make ground on Netanyahu, who argues that Hamas should be purged from Gaza.  A poll conducted for Haaretz newspaper at the weekend predicted that Likud and its allies would win 65 seats in the elections, giving it a 12-seat advantage over the centre-left parties, which are expected to capture just 53 of the 120 parliamentary seats up for grabs. &quot;Forty-one per cent said that the war was a success and 41% said it wasn&apos;t,&quot; said Tel Aviv University professor Camil Fuchs, who conducts a poll for Haaretz newspaper and Channel 10. The war has served to boost the importance of Netanyahu&apos;s key campaign issue - national security - and the debate about its aftermath has strengthened his hand. &quot;Of those who said it wasn&apos;t a success, 37% said it was because they didn&apos;t finish Hamas off while 31% said it wasn&apos;t a success because they didn&apos;t bring home [the captured Israeli soldier] Gilad Shalit,&quot; Fuchs said. Some 11% said the government failed because of the high number of Palestinian casualties. As rockets continued to fall on southern Israel, bitter divisions emerged within the cabinet yesterday over how to reach a more effective truce with Hamas. The Islamists are considering an Egyptian proposal for a one-year agreement with Israel that would take effect on Thursday. Barak, who has been exploring the deal through Egyptian mediators, recently said Israel was &quot;on the verge of a long period of quiet&quot;. But Livni accused Barak of bolstering the enemy: &quot;A settlement with Hamas would give it legitimacy, and those working for that with the Egyptians need to understand that. We need to use strength and a lot of it, there is no reason to wait.&quot;  While Barak vowed never to sign a deal with Hamas, he retorted: &quot;In election season, there is a lot of chatter by people who have never held a weapon and don&apos;t understand the conditions under which we must act. Hamas was dealt a severe blow and it will be dealt one again, but the decision needs to be made by the experts.&quot; Military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin reportedly told yesterday&apos;s cabinet meeting that the war was deterring Hamas which was beginning to understand the blow it has suffered. &quot;Despite its bragging in the media, self-examination of its operational failures has begun,&quot; Yadlin said. Hamas leaders were meanwhile flaunting their associations, as exiled leader Khaled Meshal arrived in Tehran with a retinue of aides to meet the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Meshal wanted to convey the gratitude of Palestinians for Iran&apos;s &quot;spiritual support for the Palestinian resistance against Israel,&quot; said the Irna news agency. Ahmadinejad congratulated Hamas on its &quot;victory&quot;. It may be premature. Olmert made clear yesterday that Hamas could expect further retaliation from Israel: &quot;We won&apos;t give the terror groups warning as to when and how we&apos;ll react, but Israel will respond and act at the time and place of its choosing.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-02-02T00:01:00Z", "title": "Israeli governing parties face poll battering amid Gaza scepticism", "sentences": ["&quot;Forty-one per cent said that the war was a success and 41% said it wasn&apos;t,&quot; said Tel Aviv University professor Camil Fuchs, who conducts a poll for Haaretz newspaper and Channel 10."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/02/israel-palestine-gaza-elections"}, {"tags": ["Israeli elections 2009", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "     Out of Gaza and across the border to the sound of rocket fire. A handful of hours later I am at the Hebrew University for a lecture by Gershon Baskin, one of Israel&apos;s most prominent peace activists, who is describing his attempts to open a channel of communication between Israel&apos;s leaders and Hamas. It&apos;s a strange and sudden quantum shift \u2013 from the ruins, anxiety and stench of war to normality, calm and mannered debate. What it entails is a journey from one ethos of conflict, the Palestinian one still raw, edgy and angry from the recent violence, to an Israeli one, expressed \u2013 most obviously for most \u2013 in the harsh rhetoric of political contest. In a bare room littered with bean bags and exposed piping, less than a dozen students sit patiently to listen to Baskin&apos;s account. The meeting has been organised by a group called It Is No Legend. It is an ironic play on a quote from Theodore Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism: &quot;If you will it, it is no legend&quot;. Herzl meant the will to bring about the foundation of Israel. Among this group it signifies the will to peace and coexistence with Palestinian Arabs. I know Baskin via his articles and his emails. The story he tells to the students is largely unreported: one of the hidden tales that Israel&apos;s government would like to gloss over. In meetings with Hamas figures, arranged through texts, calls and emails, Baskin established a kind of one-way channel of communication to the office of Israel&apos;s prime minister, Ehud Olmert. It was the offer of a means of negotiation that Olmert and his government emphatically rejected. The students pose questions at the end. Was the war inevitable, they want to know. Most think it was. What are the prospects for the future? It is a subdued gathering. The reality is that the facts of the war, the civilian deaths and the destruction, are not simply better known in Gaza than they are in Israel. In its sparse attendance, this meeting reflects a fundamental shift in Israeli society \u2013 despite the students&apos; excuses to the contrary. Support for the war has been almost unanimous at up to 94%. Israel&apos;s peace movement, as a consequence, has been pushed to the margins like never before. More than that, many of its members have been co-opted. I recall a conversation I had with Orith Shochat before going into Gaza. A liberal Israeli journalist, she has spent most of her life campaigning against the occupation. It was Shochat who drafted the 2003 letter for the Israeli air force pilots who refused to take part in attacks on civilian areas. This is a war, however, that Shochat has supported. When I ask her about the civilian casualties she tells me she is &quot;shocked how it does not shock her&quot;. &quot;I am amazed,&quot; she adds, &quot;how it doesn&apos;t haunt me.&quot; She reflects on a journey over five years that led her to the conclusion that the targeted assassinations she once opposed might be more moral than the alternative. That there might be no other solution to the rocket fire out of Gaza than a demonstration that Israel&apos;s commitment to deterrence has not weakened. I meet others \u2013 at a friend&apos;s flat in Jerusalem and elsewhere \u2013 who evince the same views while insisting that they belong to the left; that they support the idea of peace and a negotiated two-state solution. I hear from several people the conviction that out of the blood of Gaza a new solution and impetus towards peace might yet be born. It is a view, having come from Gaza, that I struggle to understand. Physics student Ofek Birnholtz, 25, who organised the lecture at the Hebrew University, offers another take. He is convinced that the two trends \u2013 strong support for the war and growing support for the end of occupation and a two-state solution \u2013 coexist; that it is caught up in a moment of collective anger that will pass. But the political dynamics of the Israeli election campaign suggest something else is going on. The rightwing Likud party of Binyamin Netanyahu, and the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party of Avigdor Lieberman \u2013 both of which had the least to do with the war against Gaza and Hamas \u2013 have have benefited most, suggesting a nationalist retrenchment. The reality is that a polarisation and radicalisation within Palestinian society has been reflected in an equal radicalisation among Israeli Jews, accelerated by the conflict in Gaza, that has seen even well-established connections between peacemakers on both sides collapse. The question that remains is why? For Daniel Bar-Tal, of Tel Aviv University, who has a long record of researching the functioning of each group&apos;s &quot;conflict ethos&quot; in the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation, the current state of the national psyche is as much manufactured as it is willed. He explained it in a recent interview in Haaretz. &quot;After the bitter experience of the second Lebanon war, during which the memory of the war was taken out of their hands and allowed to be formed freely,&quot; he explained, &quot;the country&apos;s leaders learned their lesson, and decided that they wouldn&apos;t let that happen again. &quot;They were not satisfied with attempts to inculcate Palestinian awareness and tried to influence Jewish awareness in Israel as well. For that purpose, heavy censorship and monitoring of information were imposed [during the Gaza campaign].&quot; It was achieved, he believes, by the willing enlistment of the media, who concentrated only on the sense of victimisation of residents of the so-called &quot;Gaza envelope&quot; \u2013 those within the range of missiles from Gaza \u2013 largely ignoring the situation of the residents of besieged Gaza. The veteran peace campaigner Gila Svirsky, of Women in Black, argues for an even more radical interpretation. At her small flat in Jerusalem, cluttered with the mementoes of her life in activism, she says she believes that much of the rejection of the &quot;others&apos; story&quot; has been self-willed. Gila tells me a story. It is about a neighbour who admits avoiding the take of foreign media on Gaza to avoid being challenged in her assumptions. &quot;You can feel it,&quot; says Gila. &quot;The temptation of being sucked into only watching Israeli news. It is really hard to extricate oneself from the dominant discourse. There is a word in Hebrew \u2013 miguyas \u2013 it means, I suppose, seduced. People don&apos;t want to go there. Don&apos;t want to think bad thoughts [about what is being done in their name].&quot; It has been accomplished, Svirsky insists, by portraying Hamas as an &quot;existential threat, the forward guard of Iran&quot;, not as a local problem to be negotiated. It is precisely the story that Netanyahu has been pushing so hard and successfully in the election campaign. But there is another difficulty. While those like Gershon Baskin frame the war in terms of multiple missed opportunities to engage with Hamas \u2013 or attempts to understand it at least \u2013 there are others on the left like Yaron Ezrahi, author and professor of politics at the Hebrew University, who believe there was a failure on the Israeli left&apos;s part to formulate an adequate response to the Qassam missiles fired out of Gaza into southern Israel. Despite that, this war \u2013 he insists to me \u2013 will be Israel&apos;s &quot;Macbeth moment&quot;. It will be something \u2013 to reverse Shochat&apos;s formulation \u2013 to shock in the long run. &quot;Israel will be forever haunted by the ghosts of this war,&quot; Ezrahi says sadly. But in the immediate aftermath of war, there does not seem to be much haunting of the majority. It is embraced enthusiastically, grimly or fatalistically as necessary. At the margins it is not rejected but avoided. I meet an elderly woman in a deli in west Jerusalem, listening to the radio and drinking her tea among a handful of pavement tables. I am told she was a demolitions expert in the Palmach, the organisation that fought for Israel&apos;s creation in 1948. We chat and she is happy to talk about most things. But when I ask her about the current situation she says \u2013 with a touch of anger at my presumption in asking the question \u2013 that she does not feel well enough informed to comment. A young woman at Hebrew University, who listens to Baskin for an hour and half, fends off my questions with the same determined excuse: she does not know enough. But in the offices of Breaking the Silence, the organisation of former Israeli soldiers dedicated to exposing human rights abuses committed by the Israeli defence forces, Michael Manekin and Yehuda Shaul believe it is simply a question of time. After previous operations, they say, it has taken six months to a year for soldiers to come forward with testimony about events that disturbed them. The media, Manekin explains, acted as the military&apos;s cheerleader at the beginning of the war in Gaza. Now, he says, it is calling every day, hungry for soldiers&apos; stories that contradict the official line. Yehuda, a burly former infantryman who served during Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, opens up a scanned file on his computer \u2013 a pamphlet circulated by the army&apos;s chief military rabbi to soldiers before entering Gaza. It is a document as unsettling in its own way as the religious justifications of Hamas for its own violence. It talks about the necessity of cruelty against the enemy, and dehumanises and de-legitimises the Palestinians and their claims. Manekin translates the words: &quot;We are not allowed by religious command to return an inch of land to the Palestinians. It is our land \u2013 God&apos;s land. There is a question [in the pamphlet]: &apos;Can we compare the Palestinians now to the biblical era of the Philistines? And if so, does this guide us how we act militarily&apos;? The answer says: &apos;Yes we can. The Palestinians like the Philistines are not a natural part of this region&apos;.&quot; Listening to Manekin, I think about the words of Bar-Tal. And I wonder \u2013 as I have always wondered in wartime \u2013 how much is manufactured? How much willed? And I wonder what kind of government a society still drunk on the euphoria of military action will elect with a handful of days remaining.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T11:03:15Z", "title": "From Gaza to Jerusalem: the impact of war on the Israeli election", "sentences": ["For Daniel Bar-Tal, of Tel Aviv University, who has a long record of researching the functioning of each group&apos;s &quot;conflict ethos&quot; in the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation, the current state of the national psyche is as much manufactured as it is willed."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/03/israel-elections-gaza-peace"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "World news"], "article": "The apparently successful launch of an Iranian satellite looks very different from Washington than it does from Tehran. For the Iranian government it is an important milestone along the road to reclaiming Persia&apos;s ancient claim to major power status, which it feels the jealous west is trying to deny it. It is also enormously significant in Iranian internal politics. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad got elected promising economic benefits for the common man and modernisation. He has made a complete mess of the first part of that mission. Delivering the second is important for his prospects of re-election in June, in the eyes of both the average voter and \u2013 even more importantly, given the controlled nature of Iranian democracy \u2013 the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. From Washington, London and some other western capitals, the launch is seen primarily through the prism of Iran&apos;s nuclear project. The capacity to put an object into space, together with the feared capability to build a nuclear device, spells \u2013 for some at least \u2013 the eventual threat of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could reach the US. &quot;There are dual applications for satellite launching technology in Iran&apos;s ballistic missile programme.

For that reason the satellite launch has a direct and immediate bearing on the debate over the US missile defence scheme. Barack Obama&apos;s team has hinted the scheme could be reviewed. That hint brought immediate dividends in the relationship with Moscow, which felt threatened by the deployment of missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic. The Bush administration insisted the system was a shield against Iran; the Russians saw it pointing at them. The Russian government said that in return for Obama&apos;s change in tone it would review its own plans to put tactical missiles in its western enclave of Kaliningrad. The diplomatic thaw, which is only a week old, generated hopes of a more productive bilateral relationship. All that is now under greater threat as a result of the Omid satellite launch by Iran, if it pushes the missile defence argument back in favour of the hawks. Mark Fitzpatrick, a specialist on the Iranian nuclear programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: &quot;It&apos;s almost as if the Iranians are in league with ballistic missile defence adherents in the United States.&quot; From a purely technical point of view, the advances represented by the satellite launch are incremental. The ballistic technology is basically the same as Iran&apos;s Shahab-3 missile, which was tested to great fanfare last year. That technology demonstrated Iran could reach Tel Aviv, Cairo or Riyadh with its missiles. The Omid satellite launch confirms that Iranian scientists have mastered the separation of payload from missile in space and placing a payload into the right orbit, both useful skills for an ICBM. It does not imply Iran is on the brink of targeting Washington with a nuclear warhead. &quot;The Iranians have shown a very rudimentary capability in a technology that requires far greater sophistication,&quot; Christopher Pang, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said. Fitzpatrick argues that a more significant missile test took place in November. The Sajjil missile launched then has about the same range as the Shahab-3, about 1,250 miles (2,000km), but it uses solid fuel rather than liquid. That is militarily significant because it is less volatile and can therefore be launched with shorter notice. The Iranians have certainly shown a lot of interest in projecting their military strength far beyond their region. However, they are probably still some way away from deploying long-range nuclear missiles. By this summer Iran will probably have produced enough low-enriched uranium to produce a bomb, if it was turned into highly enriched uranium (HEU). But that process would be hard to carry out without the UN&apos;s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, noticing. Then the HEU would have to be crafted into a warhead small enough to put on top of a missile. That too is very difficult. According to the most recent estimate by the US intelligence community, the Iranians gave up trying to do that in 2003. The Israelis have rubbished that estimate, and will be telling the Obama administration: &quot;We told you so.&quot; The launch does not directly affect Israel, as Iran has already shown it can reach Tel Aviv with the Shahab-3 missile. But the Omid satellite launch will inject more anxiety and urgency into the international debate on Iran, at a time when the new US government is trying to create some breathing space with friendly overtures to Tehran.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T13:31:53Z", "title": "Analysis: How world leaders view Iran's space ambitions", "sentences": ["That technology demonstrated Iran could reach Tel Aviv, Cairo or Riyadh with its missiles.", "The Israelis have rubbished that estimate, and will be telling the Obama administration: &quot;We told you so.&quot; The launch does not directly affect Israel, as Iran has already shown it can reach Tel Aviv with the Shahab-3 missile."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/03/iran-satellite-julian-borger-analysis"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Israeli elections 2009", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Assuming the polls are accurate \u2013 and they have been quite consistent \u2013 Israeli voters are poised to elect a rightwing government in next week&apos;s elections. But if bloggers were representative of the mainstream, Israel&apos;s next government would probably be a Jewish-Arab coalition of socialists, social democrats and environmentalists. The disparity between the polls and the blogosphere is quite remarkable \u2013 especially in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s liberal heartland, where the two parties vying for the votes of hipsters and leftist intellectuals are the Green Movement-Meimad, an environmentalist\u2013religious partnership headed by a liberal rabbi; and Hadash, a Jewish-Arab socialist party. The Hebrew-language blogger Ori Katzir made a survey of 92 prominent political bloggers. According to the final breakdown, the Green Movement-Meimad leads with 30 supporters, while Hadash comes in second with 27. It is the polar opposite of the opinion polls, which show Likud leading and Avigdor Lieberman&apos;s hardline Yisrael Beiteinu poised to tie with Labour. Hadash&apos;s rise among liberal-left, urban Jewish voters is particularly interesting. By definition a non-Zionist party that attracted most of its support from Arabs, Hadash traditionally won three or four seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Even in ultra-liberal Tel Aviv, a vote for Hadash was, until these elections, considered a radical vote. Now this has changed, partly because of the recently ended Gaza military offensive, and partly because Dov Khenin, number three on the Hadash list, recently ran a failed but vigorous campaign for mayor of Tel Aviv. Khenin&apos;s campaign brought together a diverse list of candidates that ran the gamut from Mizrachi Likud supporters to Arab feminists; the unifying factors were affordable housing, clean air and green public spaces. With that campaign, they succeeded in gathering enough support to threaten the three-term incumbent. Khenin garnered most of his support from local bloggers, who campaigned on his behalf via social media such as YouTube and Facebook. Many of them spent a lot of time with Khenin, and were impressed by the soft-spoken, modest politician and his social-democratic, inclusive agenda. But it was the Gaza war that seems to have been a deciding factor for many of its new supporters \u2013 Hadash was the only party that led opposition to the war from the very first day of the offensive. English-language Israeli bloggers tend to be heavily weighted with new immigrants whose political opinions are to the right of the mainstream, so I have taken the following sampling from the Hebrew blogosphere, which is larger and more active. Gil Rimon, a screenwriter and journalist, writes: &quot;When all the parties vote for war, it&apos;s good to know that there is one political home that makes my voice heard.&quot; Journalist Dror Feuer bases his position on Hadash&apos;s Jewish-Arab partnership \u2013 arguing that it is particularly important to raise the flag of equality now &quot;when the artillery cannons have barely gone quiet and the atmosphere is as anti-cooperation as it has ever been.&quot; Itamar Shaaltiel says there are many things that bother him about Hadash \u2013 including its communist roots and its habit of sending Jewish candidates to speak to Jewish voters, and Arab candidates to Arab voters \u2013 but he is voting for them because Hadash is the only party that opposed the war. For Uri Sabach the issue is the same.  The reason is very simple: I do not want my representatives in the Knesset voting automatically for the next war (and believe me, there will be another war). I want them to vote automatically against. To my sorrow, I can no longer trust Meretz [the leftwing party formerly led by Yossi Beilin]. Meretz is very good at being quiet when we are going to war, hugging our brave soldiers during the war, and crying over the results after it&apos;s all over.  The Green Movement-Meimad, meanwhile, does not mention the conflict with Hamas at all \u2013 although it gives emphatic support to equality between Jewish and Arab Israeli citizens. In fact, part of the movement&apos;s platform is to decry the neglect of social justice, education and welfare services in the name of security considerations. Rabbi Michael Melchior is originally from Denmark, where his family served as chief rabbis for eight generations, and he served as chief rabbi of Norway. Melchior has been a Knesset member for Meimad, a liberal Jewish party, for nearly a decade. In that time he has earned himself a reputation as an unusually courteous, intelligent man whose agenda is strongly social democratic. In teaming up with the Green Movement, he has managed to attract a following of liberals, both secular and religious. The latter belong to a minority of religious Israeli Jews who feel that their Judaism has been hijacked by the religious-nationalist settler movement. The theme of the campaign is that the state of Israel has deviated from its original social-democratic, tolerant values. At a recent campaign event that can be viewed on YouTube, Melchior shouts the following at his enthusiastic audience to rapturous applause.  A state with 280,000 children living in poverty is not a Jewish state! A country with air pollution levels that lead to 1,400 related deaths from various forms of cancer is not a Jewish state! A state that abandons its elderly is not a Jewish state!  It too has its online supporters. Yoav Lerman calls it &quot;the only party that has a serious urban plan&quot;; Michaly says she is attracted to the party for its environmental platform, but also because she is &quot;sick of the endless battle between religious and secular people&quot;. A religious-Jewish architect and urban planner who calls himself Juden Rofeh, or Jewish doctor, gives the nod to environmentalism and religious-secular tolerance, adding, &quot;notice its position on Jewish-Arab relations&quot;. One prominent blogger, Shooky Galili, who has been particularly active on behalf of the Green Movement-Meimad, links to a YouTube campaign clip that features an interview with a certain type of Tel Avivian \u2013 the type that spends time in ashrams in India and eats vegetarian food \u2013 who says the party has helped him overcome his cynicism about politics. He says:  Perhaps I&apos;ll be disappointed. But I look at it the way I look at falling in love with a woman. If it ends badly you&apos;re disappointed, but that doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll never love again.  Some see Tel Aviv, where such parties draw most of their support, as a bubble detached from the tough reality of the Middle East. For outside observers who view Israel through the prism of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there must be some cognitive dissonance in reading about a party that promotes a social-environmental platform appealing to ashram refugees and vegetarians. For this type of Tel Avivian, however, the conflict seems insoluble. It also seems far away, even though Ramallah is only one hour away by car \u2013 give or take a checkpoint or two. A friend who works for a venture capital fund in Tel Aviv described the conflict as &quot;background noise&quot;. In a way, the Green Movement-Meimad is an expression of denial. Yes, social justice and clean air are extremely important. But until the conflict is resolved, it will always take precedence. That is something that the newly converted Hadash voters do understand. But while it is true that they are not living in denial, they are certainly a minority living within a majority that overwhelmingly supported the Gaza war.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T14:50:16Z", "title": "If Israeli bloggers were representative of the mainstream ...", "sentences": ["The disparity between the polls and the blogosphere is quite remarkable \u2013 especially in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s liberal heartland, where the two parties vying for the votes of hipsters and leftist intellectuals are the Green Movement-Meimad, an environmentalist\u2013religious partnership headed by a liberal rabbi; and Hadash, a Jewish-Arab socialist party.", "Even in ultra-liberal Tel Aviv, a vote for Hadash was, until these elections, considered a radical vote.", "Now this has changed, partly because of the recently ended Gaza military offensive, and partly because Dov Khenin, number three on the Hadash list, recently ran a failed but vigorous campaign for mayor of Tel Aviv.", "One prominent blogger, Shooky Galili, who has been particularly active on behalf of the Green Movement-Meimad, links to a YouTube campaign clip that features an interview with a certain type of Tel Avivian \u2013 the type that spends time in ashrams in India and eats vegetarian food \u2013 who says the party has helped him overcome his cynicism about politics.", "Some see Tel Aviv, where such parties draw most of their support, as a bubble detached from the tough reality of the Middle East.", "For this type of Tel Avivian, however, the conflict seems insoluble.", "A friend who works for a venture capital fund in Tel Aviv described the conflict as &quot;background noise&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/feb/03/israel-election-bloggers"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israeli elections 2009"], "article": "One of Israel&apos;s most famous bloggers never writes about politics. &quot;It bores me,&quot; explains Liat Bar-On, a 36-year-old journalist. &quot;I consider myself a leftist and I was against the Gaza war, but I don&apos;t want to write about the violence and the corruption and the crappy reality around me. I prefer to bury my head in the sand and ignore it all.&quot; Bar-On&apos;s blog, Doda Malka (Auntie Malka), is about &quot;life and relationships \u2013 that is, about my relationships.&quot; She channels her considerable writing talents into musings about topics that range from why she gets irritated with friends who send long text messages to her mobile phone, to whether or not she would like to become a single mother via artificial insemination. &quot;If I lived in the United States and were as famous there as I am here,&quot; she observes, &quot;I&apos;d have between 3 and 4 million readers each day.&quot; But Israel is a small country of less than 7 million, so Doda Malka attracts about 500 readers per day. Which is why, Bar-On points out, no Hebrew-language blogger is ever going to make money from banner adverts. Besides, she adds, bloggers are not influential in Israel. Basically, they are just talking among themselves. This sentiment is echoed in a recent comment posted on Yohay E&apos;s blog, Things. After announcing that he had decided, after much deliberation, to vote Hadash, Yohay explains why he decided against the Green Movement-Meimad. He adds that, given the latter party&apos;s popularity in the blogosphere, he is certain it will win enough votes to sit in Knesset. A commenter, Suedehead, responds,   I am prepared to bet any amount of money that the Green Movement-\u00adMeimad will not even come close to winning the minimum required number of votes [to sit in the Knesset]. There is a bubble of bloggers who think they have influence over the public, but in fact they&apos;re just creating a buzz among themselves.  In Israel people often accuse those with whom they disagree of living in a bubble that is detached from reality. This is particularly true of those who love to sneer at Tel Aviv \u2013 Israel&apos;s dynamic, 24-hour capital of culture, finance and nightlife. Tel Avivians are described as navel gazers, draft dodgers and leftists who spend all their time sitting in cafes, sipping espressos, apathetic or indifferent to what goes on in the rest of the country. By 2006 the nickname had become so firmly attached to Tel Aviv, that Gal Uchovsky and Eytan Fox made a film called The Bubble. In it, they explore the idea that Tel Aviv is detached from the rest of the country, by observing the conflict through the eyes of a group of hip young friends \u2013 gay, straight, female and Palestinian \u2013 living on the city&apos;s fabled Sheinkin Street. During the Gaza offensive some students at an academic college in Sderot created a YouTube clip that simulated Tel Aviv under attack from Hamas rocket fire. The idea, they said, was to &quot;wake up apathetic \u00adpeople in Tel Aviv&quot;. In response, journalist Yair Lapid wrote an angry column for Ynet.  &quot;Despite all the admiration I hold for all those studying in the south these days, this does not grant them a license to be nasty. A total of 22 Tel Avivians were killed in one terror attack, on Tel Aviv&apos;s Route 5 bus \u2013 more than all those killed by Qassams in the past four years \u2013 yet I don&apos;t remember us saying that it makes our blood redder.&quot;  Lapid goes on to list the many suicide bombings that took place in Tel Aviv over the past years not to mention the Iraqi Scuds of the first Gulf war. The truth is that all of Israel has been under attack at one point or another over the past few years. Tel Aviv is different not because it escaped political violence, but because it remained a liberal, dynamic, creative city even during the worst days of the second intifada when suicide bombings were a daily occurrence. But it is undeniable that most people eschew political discussions these days \u2013 mostly out of accumulated weariness and cynicism. After eight years of unending violence, political crises and government corruption scandals, this attitude is easy to understand. But it is a worry for a democratic society. In the last elections, just over 52% of eligible voters arrived at the polling stations even though election day is a national holiday. And so, Israelis have turned inward \u2013 to family and nesting at home. Many of my friends boast they have stopped reading newspapers and rarely watch television news. The West Bank and Gaza are out of sight, out of mind. Palestinians from the occupied territories do not come to Israel, and Israelis, who used to shop and eat in the West Bank and Gaza, stopped visiting when the second intifada began in 2000. I am one of the few Israelis who does visit the West Bank quite regularly, but I no longer discuss with my friends what I see there. I stopped last year when a friend, over cappuccinos at a fashionable neighbourhood cafe, said: &quot;I know it&apos;s bad there, but I\u00a0feel helpless. And I have to live my life. So I\u00a0really don&apos;t want to hear the details.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-02-06T12:19:48Z", "title": "Bloggers in Tel Aviv 'Bubble' sidestep politics and focus on life and relationships", "sentences": ["This is particularly true of those who love to sneer at Tel Aviv \u2013 Israel&apos;s dynamic, 24-hour capital of culture, finance and nightlife.", "Tel Avivians are described as navel gazers, draft dodgers and leftists who spend all their time sitting in cafes, sipping espressos, apathetic or indifferent to what goes on in the rest of the country.", "By 2006 the nickname had become so firmly attached to Tel Aviv, that Gal Uchovsky and Eytan Fox made a film called The Bubble.", "In it, they explore the idea that Tel Aviv is detached from the rest of the country, by observing the conflict through the eyes of a group of hip young friends \u2013 gay, straight, female and Palestinian \u2013 living on the city&apos;s fabled Sheinkin Street.", "During the Gaza offensive some students at an academic college in Sderot created a YouTube clip that simulated Tel Aviv under attack from Hamas rocket fire.", "The idea, they said, was to &quot;wake up apathetic \u00adpeople in Tel Aviv&quot;.", "A total of 22 Tel Avivians were killed in one terror attack, on Tel Aviv&apos;s Route 5 bus \u2013 more than all those killed by Qassams in the past four years \u2013 yet I don&apos;t remember us saying that it makes our blood redder.&quot;  Lapid goes on to list the many suicide bombings that took place in Tel Aviv over the past years not to mention the Iraqi Scuds of the first Gulf war.", "Tel Aviv is different not because it escaped political violence, but because it remained a liberal, dynamic, creative city even during the worst days of the second intifada when suicide bombings were a daily occurrence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/feb/06/tel-aviv-bloggers"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Tzipi Livni", "Israeli elections 2009", "Israel"], "article": "     Tel Aviv. The Bubble, locals call it: a city separate from Israel but indivisibly entwined with it as well. Here politics is seen through a different prism: youthful, sometimes apathetic, tolerant and secular. Creative and often left-field. It is not like Jerusalem \u2013 another country, Tel Avivians joke, with its growing domination by ultra-orthodox haredis. You need a passport to go there, one adds, ironically. Nor is it like the south, the sprawling cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon, less than half an hour&apos;s drive away. The mood there is defined by their proximity to missiles fired from inside Gaza. Nor is it like the vast soulless settlement blocks, and modern satellite towns that have been grafted crudely onto the ribbed limestone hills. Tel Aviv is dilapidated and tree-lined, full of streets of scabbing buildings, representative of a modernity that is no longer modern. When the politicians have come to Tel Aviv to campaign for Tuesday&apos;s elections, they have been forced to trim the style of their campaigning for the Bubble&apos;s rhythms. Tzipi Livni, foreign minister and prime ministerial candidate for Kadima was in town last week looking for the youth vote. With the contest&apos;s electoral dynamics upset by the figure of Avidgor Lieberman&apos;s ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, who is taking votes even from Labour, Israel&apos;s young voters have suddenly become more important than ever. So Livni announced she would be the &quot;prime minister for the young&quot;. To reinforce that point she chose to make an appearance in Haoman 17, one of Tel Aviv&apos;s huge warehouse dance clubs, as popular with the out-of-towners as with the city&apos;s cool set, who prefer more intimate places. In close up it is not quite so painful. The &quot;Ice Queen&quot; wearing a white jacket, T-shirt and faded jeans \u2014 rather than the skirt suits she favours \u2014 bops self-consciously. In another, a PA announces her hilariously as: &quot;Tzipi &apos;fucking&apos; Livni&quot; as she listens in on the DJ&apos;s headphones. The wide shots are more revealing. In these strings are visible \u2013 the security goons, in jackets and ties, and media \u2013 surrounding Livni as she does the political equivalent of dancing around her handbag. It is not only Livni and Kadima. The Meretz party also hit the ultra-cool nightclub The Apartment. Others are following with similar events. I run into Teddy, a fly poster, in Sheinkin Street wearing a Haoman 17 T-shirt who growls at the intervention of politics into nightlife of the Bubble. It is not that he does not have his own political views \u2013 as he admits when pressed \u2013 and more rightwing than I might imagine. It is just it seems a sacrilege to him to allow such things into these temples of escapism. Teddy&apos;s view is echoed by the huge bouncer with blond braids outside one of the city&apos;s clubs later in the day. He refuses a campaign flyer from Dov Khenin, a member of the leftwing Arab-\u00adJewish Hadash \u2013 who ran for mayor in the recent municipal elections \u2013 who I am following, as he does a late night round of the bars. &quot;No politics,&quot; he says and hands me a card I discover later depicts two kissing men. But when you scratch beneath the surface it appears plenty of politics do exist inside the Bubble outside of a sometimes self-\u00adconscious image of being to cool to care. There are cliches that do hold up: the slightly scruffy apartments, in short supply, shared by friends who don&apos;t talk politics or news, only the latest club, so fashionable it doesn&apos;t need to advertise itself, policed by the &quot;selectors&quot; on the door. The girls on bikes \u2013 with degrees in film-making or textiles, or just out of the army \u2013 en route through the Bauhaus neighbourhoods to in-betweener jobs. Muscled guys on scooters, and gay couples drinking coffee. The gaggles of young women soldiers from the Ministry of Defence in hipster combat pants that I suspect they&apos;ve altered themselves. I arrive at the offices of Time Out, Israel, to find the staff crowded into the end of week conference in a basement, discussing the exorbitant price of vibrators in Israel for a story to be commissioned. The magazine has a section entitled \u2013 appropriately \u2013 &quot;The Bubble&quot;. Michal Geller, one of Time Out&apos;s two editors, however, believes that her city is not as disconnected from Israel as the image of the hedonistic city in the popular imagination. &quot;[The reality] is that we are not in a bubble here. We are very connected to what is going on. It is a cliche. This is what I see ... that the younger people are very dedicated to their country.&quot; Geller laughs when discussing the pictures of Tzipi Livni dancing at Haoman 17. &quot;Oh my god! You mean like she was dancing with her champagne glass!&quot; Despite that, she thinks it is logical for politicians such as Livni to be visiting the bars and clubs where the city&apos;s young people are, in search of votes, although the magazine has printed a picture of Livni in one popular bar with mocking speech bubbles. In this week&apos;s issue there is a commissioned artwork by Michal Aviv called &quot;voting and crying&quot;, depicting a tissue going into a ballot box with red all around. It is a play on the Hebrew expression &quot;shooting and crying&quot;, referring to shooting and then justifying it as sadly unavoidable in moral terms. What Geller does believe is that Tel Aviv \u2013 especially after the war in Gaza \u2013 has been moving in an opposite direction to the rest of the country&apos;s sharply rightward trend. &quot;I can&apos;t explain it,&quot; she says, flicking idly at a game of solitaire on her computer. &quot;After the Gaza situation the rest of the country went right with its political identity. It is not so much here. Exactly the opposite.&quot; I encountered Dov Khenin before his walkabout of the bars at a spacious and arty apartment in Ha Yar Kan stuffed full of music instruments, and huge pictures, hosting a meeting of young internet and media types interested in politics. As Khenin concludes, he throws the floor open to questions. One young woman asks why there can&apos;t be figures like him to be found in Gaza. &quot;There are,&quot; says Khenin. &quot;It is just that you don&apos;t know them.&quot; Later, when the talk has concluded, Maoz Dagani, a 34-year-old internet editor, explains that most people, in his view, are more interested in economics and social issues, rather than exclusively in security which has dominated the debate in much of the rest of the country. I stop for lunch at a restaurant on Sheinkin Street and ask the waiter if he will be voting. He disappears \u2013 and without being asked \u2013 conducts a straw poll of the staff. &quot;Eight will definitely vote,&quot; he tells me. One maybe. Only one will not. As we walk around the bars after the meeting, Khenin is also anxious to nail down the meaning of Tel Aviv&apos;s political culture. And its reputation. &quot;Tel Aviv is the only real city in Israel,&quot; he explains. &quot;There are a lot of young people living here, and it is diverse culturally. It is very open to new perspectives and new ideas. It is a place where new possibilities for Israeli politics are being opened.&quot; He believes too that the ugly nationalistic mood, visible elsewhere in Israel at present, is &quot;much weaker&quot; in Tel Aviv. &quot;There is a different culture in Tel Aviv,&quot; he says. &quot;It is more progressive than other places in Israel.&quot; It is clear he feels uncomfortable with the associations of the Bubble. &quot;I really do not agree with this idea of the Bubble. It is part of Israeli society. It is a very important part of Israeli society. It is the centre of Israeli society. It is not disconnected from the worries of Israeli society. But it is more open and more critical.&quot; Not everyone would agree with Khenin&apos;s analysis. &quot;We see everything on the news like all you guys see everything on the news,&quot; says Orly Snir, 24, who is talking to her friend Chen Ketsen, 28, outside the clothes shop Sylph where she works. &quot;You can live in Tel Aviv and not feel the war that we&apos;ve just had. It&apos;s not the same vibe. People just get on with their lives. It&apos;s very bubble. Very bubble,&quot; adds Snir. They are scathing too about the politicians trying to impress the young residents to Tel Aviv. &quot;Ridiculous,&quot; says Ketsen.

He has an office in Tel Aviv and another in the northern Israeli Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, where his family home is. He encourages other young Israeli Arabs to break through the glass ceiling of discrimination. He was what Israeli Arabs call a &quot;straight back&quot;, in contrast to a previous generation - the &quot;bent backs&quot; who were bowed down by the experience of the creation of the Israeli state and the wars that followed. He will look any Israeli in the eye as an equal, he insists, and shows me a painting that was given to him by the Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman. But right now Fadi is an angry man, enraged by the rise of Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Homeland) Party. On Tuesday, if all the polls are right, Lieberman will emerge as the most significant beneficiary of an Israeli general election campaign played out against the bloody background of the three-week assault on Gaza in which more than 1,300 Palestinians died, many of them civilians. The rightwing Likud party of Benyamin Netanyahu will probably emerge as the winner ahead of the Kadima party of Tzipi Livni. But most Israelis also recognise the wider significance of the moment: these elections are likely to mark the emergence of a far-right force, with a racist anti-Arab agenda, as the country&apos;s power broker. If Lieberman has his way - and his party has surged ahead of Labour to push it to a humiliating fourth place - Umm al-Fahm may be transferred out of Israel into the Palestinian Authority, something its residents forcefully oppose in exchange for Israeli &quot;villages&quot;, or settlements. Its young people may be required to serve in the army, which they currently resist as they consider that army is fighting their own people in the Palestinian Territories. They would, all in all, be required to demonstrate - in Lieberman&apos;s own words - their loyalty to the state, both ordinary people and politicians, in exchange for citizenship. But, even though his party is trailing Likud and the centre-right Kadimam, what Lieberman says matters. It is expected that a Netanyahu government would find a senior post for him, possibly as either defence or foreign minister. But his general influence is more important than any portfolio he might take. Israel&apos;s fifth elections in a decade have been characterised by incoherent campaigning by most of the parties and muddied by the effect of the campaign in Gaza. Analysts believe that a large part of Lieberman&apos;s success is that his message - racist as it is - has come through clearest. &quot;Listen,&quot; said Mustafa, the PR executive, bitterly, &quot;Who is Lieberman to say to me that I should be part of the West Bank? I speak Hebrew better than he does. I know Jewish culture better than he does. I got the highest score in Jewish history when I matriculated. I doubt he even studied Jewish history. &quot;I work together with Jews in Tel Aviv. We are the ones who are building the state together not him. It is not for Lieberman to say, &apos;You are a bad Arab and you are a good Arab. Who should stay and who should go. He will not decide who I am,&quot; he insists. &quot;I will decide who he is.&quot; It is not the first time that Umm al-Fahm has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in Israeli politics. In 1984, the ultra-rightwing Kach organisation of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane - banned as a terrorist group - tried to rally here. Then both Jews and Arabs blocked it. At the beginning of the second intifada in 2000, there were fatal riots here when the residents of the Ara valley, in which it sits, took to the streets. But the religiously conservative town is regarded by Israelis with suspicion for two other reasons. Since the 1990s it has been a stronghold for the Northern Islamic Movement. Israelis claim, too, that prior to the construction of the separation wall, Umm al-Fahm was a point of infiltration for bombers from the West Bank. Now, however, it has become a symbol of Israel&apos;s growing attitude of harshness - not only to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, but also towards the Arabs in Israel itself. A symbol of the uneasiness of the relationship between Jews and Arabs within Israel. On the Arab side, the tension focuses on the discriminatory treatment of Arabs over everything from jobs to economic opportunities, as well as anger over the treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories. For some on the Jewish side, it focuses on the twin ideas of a fear of an enemy within, combined with a more general anxiety about the demographics of a state where Jews might - in the not too distant future - become a minority. Lieberman&apos;s discourse on loyalty and citizenship, as he defines it, has crept into other areas of the debate. Last week, in response to Lieberman&apos;s proposals, Kadima leader Livni, running slightly behind Netanyahu, framed her own vision of the loyalty question in a speech to 100 local mayors. The speech differed only from Lieberman&apos;s in insisting that ultra-orthodox Haredi Jews - who are also largely exempted from the army - should also do military service. But it is not only Umm al-Fahm, a pretty little town of mosques and steep streets that is lacking in the Israeli flags so visible elsewhere - which is in Lieberman&apos;s sights. It is Israeli Arab politicians, too. He believes that the parties should be banned from the Knesset (the courts disagreed). He has said they, too, should be dealt with like &quot;other terrorists&quot; and be tried for espionage or have their citizenship revoked. Last week one of them was visiting the town: Ahmad Tibi, leader of nationalist Arab Ta&apos;al Party. In the back of his car, as he toured, Tibi warned that Lieberman poses a threat not only to Arabs but also in his view to &quot;Jews and Israel&quot;. &quot;The difference between Lieberman and [Austria&apos;s] J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen, to whom he has been compared,&quot; said Tibi, &quot;is that they were locals acting against immigrants. Lieberman is an immigrant acting against the locals. And while Umm al-Fahm is very much threatened, I think it is stronger than Lieberman. I think it is the Jewish majority that should be afraid of this phenomenon.&apos; Said Abu Shakr who runs Umm al-Fahm&apos;s art gallery, which tries to bring Arabs and Jews closer together, voices a similar warning. &quot;Lieberman is bad for both Arabs and Jews. We have to worry about Israel in general.&quot; While many Jewish voters disagree, there are some, still, who agree that the Lieberman phenomenon is a threat to all Israelis. Among them is Leon Deouell, a professor of psychology at the Hebrew University. Writing on the Yedioth Aharonot website Ynet last week, he said: &quot;Yisrael Beiteinu openly calls for undermining the most basic rights in a democratic society, including the right to express and promote one&apos;s views. Without these rights, there is no democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a clear and present danger that no voter may ignore.&quot; The residents of Umm al-Fahm would agree.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-08T00:01:00Z", "title": "Israeli Arabs fear a Gaza backlash as far right prepares for power role", "sentences": ["He has an office in Tel Aviv and another in the northern Israeli Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, where his family home is.", "&quot;I work together with Jews in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/08/gaza-israel-elections-far-right"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Israeli elections 2009"], "article": "     Things are ugly in Qarne Shomron for Beni Raz. He&apos;s a solid man in middle age with a deeply lined, expressive face. The day we meet, one of the residents of his West Bank settlement has tried to take down one of Raz&apos;s posters calling for compensation for those who want to evacuate. He also threatens Raz with violence. Driving back to his home in the settlement, Raz tries to report the threat to a blue-shirted policeman wearing a kippa. He is fobbed off. As he walks away, exasperated, one of the small group of men who were standing with the policeman \u2013 a Russian immigrant \u2013 pursues Raz across the street and shouts at him. The problem is that Raz is out of step with most of the other settlers in Qarne Shomron. Raz wants the government to pass a law to buy out him and the other settlers who would like to leave the occupied West Bank. And he is hated bitterly for it. &quot;You are living in a community beyond the Green Line. You don&apos;t like it? Leave. Go way from here,&quot; shouts the Russian angrily. &quot;It&apos;s not just me,&quot; says Beni, &quot;there are 100,000 others.&quot; &quot;You mean there is someone else apart from you who wants to leave?&quot; counters the Russian sarcastically. &quot;Yes. And I&apos;ll tell you something else. You people are terrorising people. You are scaring them.&quot; I think for a moment the Russian will hit Raz. &quot;You want all of this to be Palestine?&quot; &quot;To give back the land, sir,&quot; says Raz. &quot;What, return this land? This is my land,&quot; spits back the Russian angrily. He calls Raz a fascist. &quot;It&apos;s my land,&quot; continues the Russian, apoplectic with rage. &quot;I bought it [from the state].&quot; &quot;The state didn&apos;t buy it,&quot; says Beni. &quot;The state conquered it.&quot; I am outside the little shopping centre in Qarne Shomron, home to 6,500 people. During the second intifada, in the pink-signposted cafe, a suicide bomber exploded. Four neighbourhoods are built across these hills, deep into the West Bank. There is a new neighbourhood for English-speaking only religious Jews, a place of huge villas, some still under construction. The oldest district has residents both religious and secular. It is a place of rundown and cramped dwellings. Visible in Qarne Shomron and on the roads outside are posters for the settlers&apos; National Union party. They declare &quot;I am orange&quot;, one of the slogans of those who opposed the withdrawal of the settlements in Gaza in 2005. These days its meaning has been appropriated for the West Bank settlements, and they are plastered over even the Palestinian bus stops. The story of those who insist on staying \u2013 prolonging the occupation for religious and nationalist reasons \u2013 is well known. Less well known is the story of those few who are prepared to stick their heads above the parapet and say that they want to go. &quot;I&apos;m alone waging a war against stereotypes and I&apos;m alone in this campaign in terms of the settlers, because the settlers are very scared to speak out in case anyone one does bad things to them like they did to me,&quot; says Raz. &quot;But I know that from the little people come big things. I&apos;ll give you an example, it was four mothers that got us out of southern Lebanon. &quot;Five minutes before you arrived a settler came and ran and tore down my posters. I asked him not to and he threatened me and said he would do something very bad. He said to me: &apos;If it weren&apos;t here [by a police checkpoint] I would do something else to you somewhere else.&apos; I know exactly what he means. He&apos;s a very aggressive person.&quot; This is not so much an ideological issue for Beni Raz but a pragmatic one. He came to Qarne Shomron \u2013 supported by Israeli subsidies \u2013 because he was persuaded it would be a good life. Following the erection of the Israel&apos;s separation wall, which left his community on the wall&apos;s Palestinian side, separate from Israel, he wants his government to help and compensate those who want to leave with the same largesse that brought many of them here. To bring them back to Israel. Raz is a complex man. No leftwinger, he supported the war in Gaza. Yet he also expresses sympathy for the Arab villages around Qarne Shomron whose lands have been appropriated. He says the Jews have forgotten their own history of exile. These days he feels more sympathy with the Arab villagers. His vocal desire to leave, promoted through his organisation the One House Movement, has seen Raz ostracised in his community. He used to sing at the local community centre. No one wants him to perform any more. He says he was thrown out of his job driving a local minibus. So now he works part-time as a security guard in Tel Aviv. &quot;The Jews call me a fascist, they call me a German. They call me an Arab. They call me a land seller. A traitor. &quot;Okay. If that&apos;s the price I have to pay for the goal towards which I strive then that is what I have to pay.&quot; It has even seen differences within his family. His son Roy, who works for the telecommunications company Yes, cannot agree with Raz&apos;s stance. But he is also furious at the way his father has been treated for speaking out. For holding his own views. Roy believes it is a growing trend in Israeli society \u2013 the suppression of dissent. Sitting on their sofa in their modest house, Roy and his father launch into an argument I feel they&apos;ve been through a thousand times before. But the difference, Roy explains, between this conversation and the earlier row with the Russian is that debate is possible. Outside, Roy, believes &quot;dialogue can&apos;t happen&quot;. One thing on which the two do agree is that inevitably the settlements will be evacuated. The centre of their disagreement is whether the settlers \u2013 leaving of their own accord ahead of a final negotiated agreement \u2013 will undermine Israel&apos;s bargaining position. The only party to openly endorse the views of those like Beni Raz is the leftwing Meretz. It is faring badly with the voters. Raz&apos;s wife, who is avoiding the political debate between son and father, cooks a stew in the kitchen and hums what sounds like Bob Dylan&apos;s Blowing In The Wind while their dog Aziza scampers around the house. &quot;We are being kept here,&quot; explains Raz, &quot;to be a negotiating card for the day the agreement is finally made. I am a bulletproof vest for a future government. They could take the settlers out and leave the army. They don&apos;t have to keep me here.&quot; Why doesn&apos;t Raz simply leave? It is a question of economics. What he paid for his house in 1992, he could never recoup. The housing market knows what the politicians will not yet accept. But it is not entirely about self-interest. &quot;I&apos;m just a small citizen, I&apos;m not a meteor. With the small strength I have I want to fight at here, to ensure the bill [to compensate those who wish to leave] will be brought to the Knesset; that the bill will pass, and this country will make peace with the Palestinians so that we can live like we want to live.&quot; When I leave, Raz is singing a famous Hebrew song called You And I at the piano. We listen in Roy&apos;s room, red-painted and still adorned with the emblems of the interests of his teenage years: posters of the Beatles and A Clockwork Orange. Lines are painted on the walls from the Doors and Led Zeppelin. I listen as the two men get lost in their voices.  You and I will change the world, you and I. Then everyone else will come. It has been said before I said it, but that doesn&apos;t matter. You and I will change the world. Bad will come upon us. It&apos;s no matter. It&apos;s all right. It has been said before I said it, but that doesn&apos;t matter. You and I will change the world   It seems to me a good motto for Beni Raz.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-09T11:12:26Z", "title": "Beni Raz: the West Bank settler who wants to leave", "sentences": ["So now he works part-time as a security guard in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/09/israel-settlers-compensation"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israeli elections 2009", "Tzipi Livni"], "article": "The settlements on the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law, a stumbling block to successive peace proposals. On the day I see Beni Raz I traverse the spine of Israel&apos;s settlements in the West Bank from west of the Palestinian town of Qalqilya to Jerusalem. There are the Jerusalem settlements that probe into the Arab neighbourhoods in the city&apos;s Arab east, pushing between the towns and villages. Prising them apart. In the countryside, I speed along fast Israeli bypass roads punctuated with their watchtowers grey and tall as giant exclamation marks. Ariel goes by in a blur, big as a city, sprawling across a long ridgeline. Then the hardline settlements around Nablus, some of which I&apos;ve visited: Eli, Elon More, Yitzhar, Shiloh, breastworks of red-roofed villas spread over successive hills like the fortified communities they are. Commanding the countryside. Israel&apos;s complicity in these communities&apos; continued expansion \u2013 despite the demands of the US-backed road map for a freeze on settlement building \u2013 was revealed with the recent leaking of a secret Israeli defence ministry database that showed the involvement of government agencies and private companies, in defiance even of the state&apos;s own laws. Included in it are a number of structures at Qarne Shomron, where Raz lives. And in the present election campaign the issue of the settlements has inevitably been unavoidable. It is not only the settlers&apos; own party that has been campaigning on the issue. Binyamin Netanyahu, the leader of the rightwing Likud, who the polls suggest will win the largest number of Knesset seats, also has been rallying his supporters in the settlements with a visit to Beit Ariyeh. There he warned that Kadima, the centre-right party led by Tzipi Livni, &quot;would have us vacate this place in the belief that it would purchase peace. It won&apos;t.&quot; Instead, Netanyahu told the crowd: &quot;It will simply implant a new Hamas terror base here, stacked by Iran with Iranian missiles that would fire on Tel Aviv.&quot; And while Livni has said she would push ahead with the path to peace negotiations outlined in late 2007 at Annapolis, she is squeezed between a hawkish Netanyahu, and the ultra-nationalist Avigdor Lieberman, who would annex Israel&apos;s West Bank settlements and place towns that house some of Israel&apos;s 20% Arab minority on the other side of a new border.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-09T12:34:57Z", "title": "Courting settled opinion", "sentences": ["It won&apos;t.&quot; Instead, Netanyahu told the crowd: &quot;It will simply implant a new Hamas terror base here, stacked by Iran with Iranian missiles that would fire on Tel Aviv.&quot; And while Livni has said she would push ahead with the path to peace negotiations outlined in late 2007 at Annapolis, she is squeezed between a hawkish Netanyahu, and the ultra-nationalist Avigdor Lieberman, who would annex Israel&apos;s West Bank settlements and place towns that house some of Israel&apos;s 20% Arab minority on the other side of a new border."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/09/israeli-settlements-peace"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Israeli elections 2009", "Middle East and North Africa", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "Israelis go to the polls to elect a new government tomorrow in what is becoming a cliffhanger contest between the rightwing opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his rival Tzipi Livni, the centrist foreign minister. Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, is slightly ahead, and given the combined size of the rightwing parties that would support him he is thought most likely to lead the next coalition government. But up to a fifth of voters are thought to be undecided, according to opinion polls. Israel&apos;s proportional representation voting system is complicated and no single party will be able to form a government without bringing four or five other parties into a coalition. Even if Livni&apos;s Kadima party emerges with the largest number of seats most analysts think she would struggle to put together a like-minded coalition with enough seats to have a majority in the Knesset, or parliament. &quot;It will be very, very difficult for Livni to form a government, even if Kadima turns out to be the bigger party, because every government of Livni would depend on a rightwing party,&quot; said Yossi Verter, a political commentator for the left-leaning Ha&apos;aretz newspaper. After the final results of the election are formally published in a week&apos;s time Israeli president Shimon Peres will consult with the leaders of all parties and will choose one MP to form a coalition. That decision will probably be made on Friday next week and whoever is chosen would then have 42 days to form the coalition. In the past the president has always turned to the leader of the largest party, though the law does allow him to turn to others if they are more likely to form a \u00admajority coalition. That means if Netanyahu comes in second but the rightwing parties do as well as the polls suggest, Peres might still call on him to form the coalition. &quot;Since Likud has such a big bloc, it is not impossible that Peres will give the mandate to Netanyahu even if Likud is smaller than Kadima,&quot; Verter said. The high level of undecided voters hours before polling begins is unusual in Israel and suggests a broader frustration with many of the country&apos;s political leaders. Both Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, head of the Labour party, have been prime minister in the past and were generally regarded as unpopular. Livni has been criticised for lacking experience. &quot;Just a few weeks ago everyone was happily bathing in the pool of national consensus created by the operation in Gaza,&quot; Nahum Barnea, a leading columnist, wrote in today&apos;s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. &quot;How strong we are, everyone said, how united we are. Now it becomes apparent that underneath this joyful power hides a frightened people, wishing for someone strong and forceful, who will \u00admiraculously fend off the people&apos;s enemies, real and \u00adimaginary.&quot; Barnea argued that the election campaign showed only that Israel&apos;s political establishment &quot;no longer meets the needs of the country and society&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The larger they are on the billboards, the more they are dwarfed by the country&apos;s problems.&quot; Only a few weeks ago Netanyahu had a commanding lead in the opinion polls, a lead apparently reinforced by Israel&apos;s devastating war in Gaza. However, in the final days of the campaign he has begun to lose support to Avigdor Lieberman, a far-right secular politician whose populist tone has captured the public mood like never before. Netanyahu has made a point of not attacking Lieberman in his campaign. The last polls, released on Friday, gave Netanyahu between 25 and 27 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, ahead of Livni&apos;s Kadima party on 23 to 25 seats. It is widely presumed that if Netanyahu wins he will turn to Lieberman to join his coalition, offering a major cabinet position. Some reports have suggested Lieberman wants to be defence minister, regarded as perhaps the most high-profile job after prime minister, although his elevation to such a key post is by no means certain. &quot;He is an enigma in Israeli politics,&quot; Verter said of Lieberman. &quot;You can never foresee his actions or his next move.&quot; While Lieberman is loud and aggressive in campaigning and in opposition, Verter said in the past he had remained quiet when in government. Livni has pointedly not ruled out an alliance with Lieberman herself and was reportedly ready to offer two incentives \u2013 a law on civil marriage and a reform of the election system \u2013 both of which Lieberman has demanded. However, any deal with him would probably cost her the support of some of the smaller leftwing parties likely to join her bloc, including the Arab parties and Meretz, leaving her still reliant on at least one other rightwing party to form a majority coalition Livni spent today on a train journey from Tel Aviv to Be&apos;er Sheva, in Israel&apos;s south and has delivered a determinedly centrist pitch. &quot;We have proved that security does not belong only to the right and peace does not belong only to the left,&quot; she said at a rally in Tel Aviv yesterday. Netanyahu has taken a more rightwing position, travelling up to the Golan Heights yesterday with his party&apos;s most hawkish figures to plant a tree and to insist he would never give up that piece of territory \u2013 captured by Israel in 1967 from Syria. &quot;The Golan will remain ours only if Likud is elected,&quot; he said. Meanwhile in Gaza, fighting continued. A Palestinian militant from the Islamic \u00adJihad was killed early this morning in a clash with Israeli troops.

Everything and nothing.  Start with the nothing. The battle to be prime minister comes down to two candidates, former PM Binyamin &quot;Bibi&quot; Netanyahu of Likud and current foreign minister Tzipi Livni of Kadima.  As the race between the two has tightened, with the last polls showing only a two-seat gap between them, the pair have scrambled to define themselves more sharply. &quot;Livni at last let the word peace come out of her mouth,&quot; says Aluf Benn of the liberal daily Haaretz, while &quot;Bibi planted a tree in the Golan [Heights] and went for a walkabout in East Jerusalem.&quot;  In those moves, Livni and Netanyahu were both acting out age-old roles, the peace candidate doing battle with the hawk. But no one seriously believes that Livni is about to deliver an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty, just as no one kids themselves that Bibi is going to realise the now-fading Likud dream of Greater Israel. Instead, in the words of one senior Israeli official, &quot;Whoever wins, it will be more of the same: convergence on the pragmatic centre.&quot; If Livni were somehow to pull off a double upset, emerging with both the most seats and a presidential invitation to form a government \u2013 and the latter does not automatically follow the former \u2013 she would continue in the same vein as the outgoing Olmert administration she served: more talks with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, more of the Annapolis process started in November 2007 and more isolation of Hamas.  Netanyahu&apos;s rhetoric has been different, ruling out any compromise on Jerusalem and still refusing to accept a Palestinian state. But were he to return to the prime minister&apos;s office, few believe he would maintain that hard line. First, he will look leftward for coalition partners, preferring to be the hawk in a centrist government than the centrist in an ultra-hawkish one. He knows that his relationship with the US \u2013 which matters more to Israeli leaders than almost anything else \u2013 will be doomed if he becomes the prisoner of rightist parties, constantly demanding settlement expansion and the like.  The result will be that Netanyahu, too, will stay on the Annapolis track, continuing to negotiate with the PA. The tone will be different from Livni&apos;s \u2013 though some say Netanyahu might even end up yielding more than she would. First, because he will be anxious, in Benn&apos;s words, &quot;to prove to world opinion that he is not a monster&quot; and, second, because his vision of &quot;economic peace&quot; calls for nurturing prosperity on the West Bank, and that must entail reducing the number of checkpoints that currently restrict Palestinian movement so badly.  Hence the impression that there&apos;s not much difference at the top \u2013 and next to nothing at stake. And yet, others say something very profound is on the line in this election, their angst stirred by the rise and rise of the man set to claim third place and the role of kingmaker: Avigdor Lieberman. A nationalist to his friends, a racist to his enemies, the Russian-born Lieberman poses as an Israeli Putin, the strongman saviour Israel is crying out for. His signature proposal is to remove the citizenship of anyone who refuses to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state: his target is clearly the 1.45m Palestinian Arabs who live as citizens inside Israel proper. Many liberals laugh off Lieberman as an opportunist, insisting that his loyalty oath plan will come to nothing. But others tremble at the toxicity he has unleashed.

She talks of her commitment to a two-state peace deal with the Palestinians, but in her role as foreign minister and chief Israeli negotiator during the past year of peace talks she failed to make any concrete progress on the ground. Livni is unlike her rivals in many ways \u2013 a relative newcomer to politics, she gave up her career as a lawyer barely a decade ago to become a politician.  She is one of few women to take a major political position in Israel and often speaks curtly about the routine discrimination that brings. She has a rare, corruption-free, &quot;Mrs Clean&quot; reputation. However, Livni failed to form a government last autumn after Ehud Olmert, the prime minister and then Kadima leader, announced he was resigning in the wake of several high-profile corruption investigations.  Now she leads a party that polls suggest is significantly weaker than when it won the last election three years ago, and even though she is in a close second place, Livni faces an uphill struggle to become the next prime minister. Her background is firmly embedded in Israel&apos;s right wing. She was born into a &quot;fighting family&quot;, and one that is much respected in Israel. Her father, Eitan Livni, was a senior figure in the Irgun, the underground militant Zionist movement that fought the British before the creation of the state.  She herself served as a young agent in Israel&apos;s foreign secret service, the Mossad, and then gave up an agency career to become a commercial lawyer until one autumn holiday, not long after the signing of the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, she decided to step into politics. Livni, who is 50 and married with two sons, has been tipped for along time as a future leader, and in recent months emerged as more dovish than many in her party. On the Palestinian front, she advocates a two-state, negotiated settlement. On Iran and its nuclear ambitions, she favours a tightening of sanctions but seems less eager than other leading politicians for an outright military confrontation. In a speech to a security conference last week, she threatened continued attacks in Gaza, sounding like any rightwing politician when she said: &quot;Terror must be fought with force and lots of force.&quot;  At the same time, she suggested there was still a chance of a peace deal with the Palestinians. &quot;The dove is on the window sill. We can either slam the door or let it in. The choice is in your hands,&quot; she said. However, her position on a peace deal comes from a conservative stance. She opposes the return of any Palestinian refugee to what is now Israel, and she appears to oppose the division of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital. On the third core issue, the borders of a future state, she clearly wants major changes to the pre-1967 boundary to incorporate settlement blocs, saying she believes in &quot;maintaining maximum settlers&quot;. Three years ago, she followed the then prime minister and Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, when he left the party, and created his own movement, Kadima, or the Forward party. He argued that the dream of a Greater Israel from the Mediterranean to the river Jordan was unachievable, and that the land should be shared with a Palestinian state. The creation of that Palestinian state is still a distant prospect, but many argue Livni is committed to a peaceful solution to the seemingly intractable Middle East conflict. With Livni as prime minister, peace talks could be expected to continue, but it is not clear how much that message has resonated with the electorate at a time when the public mood has shifted to the right. &quot;We have proved that in tough times, even in times of despair, we can replace despair with hope, and we can also dream,&quot; she said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Her words echoed those of Barack Obama, but have had barely the same impact.  &quot;We have proved that security does not belong only to the right and peace does not belong only to the left,&quot; she said. Livni is operating in an intensely male environment, where military experience is often highly regarded as political acumen. She has already had to fight off suggestions she might be too weak for the job.  &quot;The fact that I&apos;m a woman doesn&apos;t make me a weak leader,&quot; she told the Jerusalem Post last autumn. &quot;It&apos;s not that generals pull the trigger and women don&apos;t.

After casting her vote in Tel Aviv, Livni urged people to ignore the bad weather and cast a vote for &quot;hope&quot;. &quot;I have just done what I want every citizen in Israel to do \u2014 get out of the house, rain or not, cold or hot, go to the polling station, go into the booth, close your eyes, and vote, not out of fear or despair, and think about hope,&quot; she said. In Jerusalem, Netanyahu predicted &quot;a good victory&quot;. The leader of the Likud party, Netanyahu has led the opinion polls for months and most analysts believe he has the best chance of forming a new coalition government, even though his lead has shrunk in recent days. The bloc of rightwing parties that will support him looks likely to be enough for a majority in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Even if the Kadima party emerges slightly ahead analysts think Livni would struggle to put together a like-minded majority coalition. &quot;Netanyahu has the biggest bloc,&quot; said Yossi Verter, a political commentator for the left-leaning Ha&apos;aretz newspaper. &quot;It will be very difficult for Livni to form a government, even if Kadima turns out to be the bigger party, because every government would depend on a rightwing party and the right wing will always quit the coalition whenever there is some progress with the Palestinians or the Syrians.&quot; Verter said it was most likely that Avigdor Lieberman, the populist far-right leader, would join Netanyahu in a new government. Only a few weeks ago, Netanyahu had a solid poll lead, reinforced by Israel&apos;s war in Gaza. However, in the final days of the campaign he began to lose support to Lieberman and his popular attacks on Israel&apos;s Arab minority. The last polls, released on Friday, gave Likud between 25 and 27 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and Kadima 23 to 25 seats. &quot;A large part of the Israeli public is indifferent. They don&apos;t see much of a difference between Likud and Kadima,&quot; said Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He said a Netanyahu government would be likely to resist all but the most intense international efforts to forge a peace deal with the Palestinians. &quot;There would be a coalition that tries to be tougher on the negotiations with Obama, with Europe and with moderate Arab countries, and tends to stall any agreement rather than move vigorously [to] a settlement.&quot; Nahum Barnea, a leading columnist, argued in yesterday&apos;s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the campaign demonstrated that Israel&apos;s political establishment &quot;no longer meets the needs of the country and society&quot;. &quot;The larger they are on the billboards, the more they are dwarfed by the country&apos;s problems,&quot; he wrote. Pouring rain and strong winds today were expected to keep voter numbers low. Turnout at the last election in 2006 was 63.2%, the lowest in Israel&apos;s history. Lieberman called the rain a &quot;blessing&quot; as he cast his ballot in the settlement of Nokdim. &quot;Our people will come out and vote even if there&apos;s a hurricane,&quot; he said. His Yisrael Beiteinu party pledges to get tougher with Palestinians, including Israeli Arab citizens, and keep Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. In the Arab Israeli town of Umm el-Fahem police were forced to intervene to prevent a clash between a hardline Jewish legislator and Israeli Arabs. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said officers whisked election observer Arieh Eldad, of the nationalist Ichud Leumi (National Union) party, out of the town after &quot;tensions rose&quot; between him and residents, who hurled stones at police. Five Israeli Arabs were arrested but there were no injuries. After the results of the election are formally published next week, the president, Shimon Peres, will consult the leaders of all parties and choose one to form a coalition within 42 days. In the past, the president has always turned to the leader of the largest party, although the law allows him to choose a smaller party if it is more likely to form a majority.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-10T09:31:56Z", "title": "Livni and Netanyahu level as Israeli election begins", "sentences": ["After casting her vote in Tel Aviv, Livni urged people to ignore the bad weather and cast a vote for &quot;hope&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/10/israel-election-tzipi-livni-binyamin-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Israeli elections 2009", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "They are a minority now in Israeli politics, at least according to the polls. But spare a thought this election day for the Israeli peacenik: how should he or she vote today? If it were a direct presidential clash between Likud&apos;s Bibi Netanyahu and Kadima&apos;s Tzipi Livni \u2013 the only two candidates with a realistic chance of becoming prime minister \u2013 then the choice might be straightforward. They would back Livni. After all, she believes in the two-state solution, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and has been negotiating with the Palestinians as foreign minister for the last 18 months, if not longer. Bibi meanwhile still rejects the very idea of a Palestinian state \u2013 which even George W Bush accepted \u2013 and rules out territorial compromise. But a simple choice of Tzipi over Bibi is not on the Israeli ballot today. Israel&apos;s is a parliamentary system with an extreme form of proportional representation, offering this year a record 33 parties to choose from. So which one should the dovish voter pick?  Some are plumping for Kadima, on the simple logic that Livni needs as many seats as possible to squeak ahead of Netanyahu and have a chance at forming a government. That&apos;s the position Ha&apos;aretz \u2013 the paper of choice for liberal Israel \u2013 effectively adopted in its editorial on Tuesday morning, endorsing Livni as the best choice for PM.  But others are holding back, deterred by Livni&apos;s role as part of the ruling troika responsible for the military offensive in Gaza. What&apos;s more, Kadima has signalled its willingness to form a coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, the strongman whose race-baiting campaign has centred on his promise to strip Israel&apos;s Arab citizens of their citizenship \u2013 including their right to vote \u2013 if they refuse to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state.  The obvious solution should be to vote Labour, once Israel&apos;s natural party of government and the home of the peace camp. The trouble there is that party leader Ehud Barak was, as defence minister, the co-author of Operation Cast Lead. What&apos;s more, Bibi has telegraphed pretty clearly that he plans to appoint Barak as his defence minister in a Likud-Labour coalition, so the Labour voter would end up with Bibi as PM. What&apos;s worse, Barak has not ruled out joining a government that includes Lieberman.  What&apos;s left? Meretz is the pure left choice, favoured by many in the media and academic elites clustered around north Tel Aviv. But it had a muddled stance on Cast Lead, supporting it first, then opposing it. It has a well-liked but unforceful leader and, since a centre-left coalition is unlikely, it will almost certainly be destined for opposition. And what if Livni loses to Bibi by a whisker? Plenty of Meretz types will feel guilty that they didn&apos;t hold their noses and give Kadima that extra push.  Some are going a stage further, backing the Jewish-Arab, onetime communist party, Hadash. It&apos;s become trendier this year among young leftists, and it had a clear line against the Gaza offensive from the start. But it, too, is destined for opposition and its advocacy of a single state \u2013 rather than a two-state solution \u2013 puts it beyond the pale for many on the traditional Zionist left.  So it&apos;s not an easy choice. Plenty of people here have asked how I would vote if I had the chance. The truth is I don&apos;t know; I&apos;d be wavering between pragmatism and principle, between blocking Likud and Lieberman and a vote of conscience. I don&apos;t envy the doves of Israel their dilemma. Postscript added at the author&apos;s request on February 11 at 18:00: &quot;I fear I may have mischaracterised Hadash&apos;s position. While many supporters of that party speak of Jews and Arabs eventually sharing a single state, Hadash&apos;s official stance calls for two states side by side, on the 1967 lines.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-02-10T14:00:00Z", "title": "Jonathan Freedland: Who should Israel's doves vote for today?", "sentences": ["Meretz is the pure left choice, favoured by many in the media and academic elites clustered around north Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/10/israeli-elections-tzipi-livni-binyamin-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Israeli elections 2009", "Middle East and North Africa", "Gaza", "World news"], "article": "Braving torrential rain and howling wind, voters defied predictions and turned out in force for today&apos;s elections, which \u2013 at the time of writing \u2013 are still hanging on a knife-edge. While the voting is too close to call, the fact that so many decided to cast their ballot at all signifies the importance with which Israel&apos;s citizens are taking the current political situation \u2013 and well they should.  The longer the conflict rages, the more polarised becomes Israeli society: both the older generation that has lived through previous decades of fighting, and the younger voters who have spent their formative years absorbing their elders&apos; opinions by osmosis; as much for Israel&apos;s Arab citizens, as for its Jewish population. The spectre of Avigdor Lieberman has, it seemed, spooked out of their apathy many who, previously, would have shunned the electoral process, either because of indifference, or \u2013 in the case of many Arab communities \u2013 due to their desire to boycott Israel&apos;s legislature.  Last-minute strategising was the order of the day, with frantic phone calls and email appeals entreating undecided voters to cast a vote on the basis that prevention is better than cure: a vote for Livni was, according to many commentators, less a show of support for her as a potential leader and more a way of stopping the Likud bandwagon rolling onwards.  At the same time, fear and loathing resonated ever louder with Israel&apos;s rightwing citizenry, many of whom swallowed the line that the only way to guarantee Israel&apos;s security was to vote for the hardest-line candidates on offer. In the taxi home just now, I was treated to the Shas-supporting driver&apos;s take on regional politics.  Having assured me that the ideal prime minister would have been Rav Ovadia Yosef (&quot;because then our children would have proper education&quot;), he went on to trumpet Shas&apos; position vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinian &quot;problem&quot;. &quot;The Palestinians are scared of the religious parties,&quot; he declared. Was that what we wanted, I asked him \u2013 to scare the Palestinians as a way of ensuring quiet for future generations?  &quot;Listen to me,&quot; he replied angrily. &quot;Listen, and you&apos;ll learn something. Even in a million years, we&apos;ll never have peace between us. The only way to keep Arabs quiet is to give them a boom to the head day after day,&quot; emphasising his point by striking the flat of his left palm with a clenched right fist. &quot;What about &apos;loving your neighbour as yourself&apos;?&quot; I countered, prompting a Vesuvius-like eruption in response.  &quot;What are you saying \u2013 that the Arab is my friend?&quot; he snapped back. He belonged to the view that all of &quot;them&quot; want to drive &quot;us&quot; into the sea, in time-honoured fashion. &quot;That&apos;s what they used to say about Jews,&quot; I told him, &quot;that we want to destroy the gentiles and tear apart the fabric of their society.&quot; But \u2013 of course \u2013 &quot;this situation&apos;s different,&quot; he assured me forcefully.  It&apos;s always different here, as the politicians ram home to their fearful faithful week after week, year after year. If we don&apos;t want to be drowning in the waters of the Mediterranean, we have to fight them on the beaches, in the refugee camps, the olive groves, and wherever else the paranoia guides us. This time, however, the rejectionist backlash may be gathering pace, among the younger voters at least, many of whom are eschewing the firebrand rhetoric of Bibi and Co, and opting for progressive, pro-dialogue parties such as Meimad Yarok and Hadash, both of whom are tipped to register significant showings at the polls.  I was proud to cast my ballot in Hadash&apos;s favour today, and was just as happy to explain why I&apos;d done so in an interview with the New York Times at the voting hall in front of scornful Jerusalemite conservatives. There is nothing treasonous whatsoever about seeking an egalitarian future for those living within Israel&apos;s borders; the opposite is true, in fact, since the only way to achieve a real and lasting peace is by mutual recognition of Israeli Jews and Arabs as being jointly worthy of full rights and opportunities in a land they are destined forever to share.  That truth may be a bitter pill for some to swallow, but \u2013 since past experience has proved that division and discord is a guaranteed non-starter in the peace stakes \u2013 backing a more tolerant and inclusive manifesto is putting the best foot forward for all residents of the region.

He said a national unity government, bringing together the main parties, was most likely. &quot;The only question is who is going to head it,&quot; he said.

The left-wing bloc, on the other hand, would struggle to come up with more than 56 seats. Even if Livni wants to form a national unity government, bringing both Netanyahu and Barak on board, there is no guarantee either would accept. Barak said he would continue to lead Labour and left open the possibility of joining a new government. &quot;Nothing can be taken for granted,&quot; he said.

The Knesset will be composed of 12 parties, none of which have crossed the threshold of one-quarter of the seats. These results adequately reflect the state of Israeli society. The Israeli electorate is in a state of deep confusion and desperation and Israel is moving into a bunker mentality. The election campaign was primarily based on the expression and mobilisation of fear, and there was hardly any message of hope. What is difficult to understand from the outside is the extent to which Israel is today primarily driven by annihilation anxiety, and such anxiety generally leads to a freeze and makes innovative, bold and creative steps impossible.  The reason for this is that most Israelis simply don&apos;t see a way towards peace. The second intifada, and the rocket volleys from the Gaza Strip since Israel&apos;s unilateral withdrawal have enormously strengthened the right, which has won a majority of Knesset seats. Netanyahu&apos;s mantra for a long time has been:  If we lose military control over the territories, they will turn into terror bases; they will arm themselves with rockets and make life in Israel impossible. We have made that mistake in Gaza; if we make it with the West Bank, the rockets will shut down Ben Gurion Airport, and they will reach Tel Aviv.  Events in Gaza, unfortunately, have proven him right, and the threat of a nuclear Iran looms over all Israelis. As a result the rightwing bloc has more than half the seats, which means that the peace process is unlikely to proceed.  The strongest indicator of the level of anxiety is that Avigdor Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beiteinu has won more mandates than the Labour party, which one of the natural ruling parties of the country for most of its history. Lieberman&apos;s party was originally founded to recruit its electoral base primarily among the one million Russians who had immigrated to Israel in the 1990s. Pre-election polls showed that a significant proportion of Lieberman&apos;s support came from Israelis who were born there.  Lieberman, a skillful and shrewd politician, built his campaign on the slogan &quot;no citizenship without loyalty&quot;. Officially, this slogan only takes issue with Arab members of the Knesset who support terror or deny Israel&apos;s right to exist, but it is a slogan with distinctly fascist undertones. Lieberman has proposed that citizens need to take an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state and it hymn to keep their citizenship \u2013 an ominous proposal which can easily be stretched to the point of silencing any opposition.  Lieberman&apos;s ascent is a symptom of the profound anxiety that governs Israel. History shows, and psychological research corroborates, that under conditions of fear and existential panic, voters tend to seek leaders whose message is based on a black-and-white worldview and who provide the possibility to transform fear into hatred of an enemy, and Lieberman has skillfully capitalised on this with his strident anti-Arab rhetoric.  The second main result of these elections is that for all intents and purposes, the Israeli left has ceased to exist. Meretz, the social democratic party that believes Israel should be a liberal democracy with equal rights for all, had ended up with three mandates, and its impact on policy is negligible. Labour competes on an agenda that can hardly be differentiated from the explicitly centrist Kadima party, and it has now fallen to a historic low of 13 mandates.  Prospects are more than bleak. These elections have proven that even though Israel is a hi-tech powerhouse with a strong army and a functioning democracy, it no longer has the ability to think strategically, act morally and truly manage its own fate. Given that the Palestinians have lost any cohesiveness and have no functioning leadership, the region is likely to deteriorate into chaos and violence. Israel&apos;s tragedy is that the motivation for the Zionist project was to allow Jews a life of dignity, freedom and self-determination. Instead Israel is turning into a ghetto, progressively oblivious of the outside world, with a paranoid and often dehumanising attitude towards Arabs and deafness towards the values of the western world to which it wants to belong. The resulting moral blindness was dramatically shown in the way the Gaza operation was conducted.  Because the Palestinians have no Nelson Mandela and Israel has no De Klerk, and because there is no leadership worthy of the name on either side, the only way to avert catastrophe is that the US will muster the political will to pressure Israel and the Palestinians into a process along the lines of the Arab League initiative and to move towards a comprehensive, regional settlement.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-11T13:30:01Z", "title": "Carlo Strenger: Israel's anxiety has led to a election stifling any creative ideas for peace", "sentences": ["We have made that mistake in Gaza; if we make it with the West Bank, the rockets will shut down Ben Gurion Airport, and they will reach Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/11/israeli-elections-2009-israelandthepalestinians1"}, {"tags": ["Animals", "Waste", "Environment", "Society", "Local government"], "article": "     In Edinburgh, they use a mobile CCTV van. In Lincolnshire, it&apos;s enforcement agents on 650cc motorbikes. Kennet in Wiltshire has dished out half a million bags for free. Liverpool got council officials to pose undercover as courting couples in its parks. And Hinckley in Leicestershire hired a team of private detectives. In Cheltenham, for a while, operatives from the local authority painted pretty coloured circles - one red, one yellow, one white - round every bit they found. Abroad, the struggle has reached a higher plane. In their search for incontrovertible scientific proof, Germany&apos;s Cologne and Dresden, Vercelli in Piedmont, Italy, and Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv in Israel, have resorted to DNA testing. Paris has adopted shock tactics in the shape of some truly revolting posters. Geneva, being Swiss, simply fines first-time offenders \u00a31,700. Then \u00a38,000 if they do it again. Dog mess. It&apos;s war out there. Sorry, that sounded flippant; this is a subject that invites humour. But it&apos;s actually not funny. A lot of people feel very strongly indeed about it; as a nation, according to Keep Britain Tidy, we write more letters to our elected representatives, locally and in Westminster, about dog fouling than we do about anything else. Questioned, we invariably rate it a top priority for council spending (which is fortunate, because they&apos;re already devoting an eye-watering \u00a322m a year to it). Dog-do is, in short, a serious and emotive issue, doubtless in part because dogs themselves are now a serious and emotive issue. And nowhere - or at least, nowhere I&apos;ve been recently - is that more evident than in the small and otherwise pretty tranquil east Devon town of Ottery St Mary, birthplace of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and home of the Night of the Flaming Tar Barrels (I hadn&apos;t heard of it either, but the photos look spectacular). In the dog poo war, Ottery is something of a frontline town, with serious talk right now of banning dogs from its parks. Battle lines have been drawn. &quot;We are witnessing,&quot; mutters a steely-eyed man to me in the primary-school playground, &quot;an aggressive and thoroughly unpleasant campaign by the dog lobby. I don&apos;t want my name in the paper. But certain people in this town should be ashamed of themselves. It&apos;s got nasty. Personal. We&apos;re doing this for our children&apos;s safety. Everyone should understand that.&quot; Rubbish, says a bitter Monica Palfrey, 74, crossing the rainswept Land of Canaan park on a mobility scooter with Kiki, Bo and Amy, her three shitsus perched on the front. &quot;I&apos;ve lived here all my life; I remember when this was just a field. Never, ever has there been talk of actually banning dogs. What are they even thinking of? Where else could people like me exercise their pets? It makes me sad. And very cross.&quot; At the end of last month, public consultation ended on a proposal by Ottery town council to ban dogs completely from one of the town&apos;s two open spaces, and oblige owners to keep them on a lead in the other. As is now the case in most public areas in Britain, Ottery&apos;s dog owners are already obliged by law to pick up their pets&apos; mess (&quot;Bag it and bin it,&quot; exhort a myriad stickers), and to keep the animals clear of the swings and slides and climbing frames of the children&apos;s play areas. Now, if East Devon district council (EDCC) gives the go-ahead - and over the last 12 months, 50-plus parish, town and district councils have enacted similar orders denying dogs access to open land - walkies and the attendant business will have to be performed on the town&apos;s streets; on a rough and unwelcoming patch of ground on the edge of town; or a car journey away in the countryside.  Quite right too, thinks Claire Gunningham, mother of two children at the school. &quot;I know lots of responsible dog owners, people who pick up every time,&quot; she says. &quot;But I&apos;m sorry, it&apos;s just not compatible, is it, to have dogs pooing on the ground and then kids coming along and playing on it? It&apos;s horrible, absolutely horrible. Really disgusting. And unfair. If it was humans there&apos;d be uproar. Dogs we just let get away with it.&quot; Waiting in the playground at 3.30 on a Monday afternoon, there are plenty to agree with her. &quot;Dog mess is a massive problem,&quot; says Sharon Davis, a mother of four. &quot;It&apos;s everywhere, even outside the school gates. I&apos;ve had kids of mine come running out the gates, across that bit of grass there, and ... Well, it&apos;s just foul. Specially when they&apos;re little, always falling over and rolling on the ground. That has to be one of your worst nightmares, hasn&apos;t it; a two-year-old face down in a pile of dog poo.&quot; In the town council offices, a pleasing period residence up the hill next to the church, Ottery&apos;s mayor, Glyn Dobson, has plainly heard that cry. &quot;We have a duty of care to our children,&quot; he says. &quot;In a city, maybe there aren&apos;t many places to take a dog. Here there are literally hundreds of walks, but there&apos;s only one park, and only one playing field. We&apos;ve got nothing against dogs; half the councillors have one and one of them has four. What we are against is dogs running around with kids.&quot; For the town&apos;s dog owners, many of them parents themselves, that is a step too far. Yes, dog owners may have a regrettable tendency to feel their pets can do no wrong. Yes, there are non dog-owners who quite simply dislike dogs. But have we really reached a point, in an English country town, where dogs and people cannot peacefully co-exist? A resistance movement has been formed. The fightback has begun. And not without some early success: at the end of January, the Kennel Club&apos;s national Campaign of the Year award was won by a group called Ottery Dogs. We&apos;ll come back to them later. Last year, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers&apos; Association, there were 7.3m dogs in Britain. The north-east is home to the nation&apos;s most fervent dog-lovers, with 30% of households owning one or more, followed closely by the south-west, with 29%. The south-east has just 17%, and - odd as this may seem to anyone who regularly walks some of the capital&apos;s streets - only 7% of London families own dogs. Between them all, they produce an estimated 1,000 tonnes of faeces a day. Dog mess is, we know, repulsive stuff; enough, sometimes, to make even the most besotted of dog-lovers gag. It can also be dangerous: Toxocara canis is the common roundworm of the dog, and the faeces of an infected animal can carry up to 1m Toxocara eggs. Probably only about 5% of pet dogs are infected, mostly puppies and pregnant bitches, but the eggs - which become infectious only when they mature, about two or three weeks after being deposited - can lie dormant in soil for up to three years, and are highly resistant to temperature changes or chemical disinfectants.  If you (or, more likely, your child) swallows these microscopic eggs, for example after touching infected soil or a shoe or a buggy wheel and putting their hands to their mouths, they can contract toxocariasis. The symptoms include aches, dizziness, nausea, asthma, epileptic fits and eye disorders that can occasionally culminate in blindness. Up to 100 cases a year are reported in Britain, mostly in children under five. When I was growing up, and until maybe 15 years ago, dog mess was more or less a fact of life. Unpleasant, but kind of accepted. You watched out for it, swore if you stepped in it, and that was about it. Dog owners would no more have considered cleaning up after their pets than, say, drivers would have felt constrained to forego that last pint for the road, or smokers to stub their fag out in a restaurant.  Times, and attitudes, change. The Litter (Animal Droppings) Order 1991 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 obliged local councils to keep public walkways, pleasure grounds, gardens, recreational areas and popular parts of the seashore clear of fouling. The Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 made failing to clear up dog poo an offence punishable by a fixed penalty of \u00a350 or, in court, a fine of up to \u00a31,000.  Under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, councils can designate land to be covered by Dog Control Orders, which can oblige owners to clear up dog mess, require dogs to be kept on leads, restrict the number of dogs any one person may take on the land, or simply ban the animals altogether (as the EDDC is now proposing, at the request of the town council in Ottery St Mary). Keep Britain Tidy, which carries out regular national dog fouling surveys, reckons 91% of local councils in Britain now employ at least one dog warden and 86% run active anti-dog mess campaigns. Between them, the 50%-odd of councils that responded to the charity&apos;s last survey, in 2006, issued nearly 5,500 verbal and written warnings to dog owners, handed out 2,400 fixed penalty notices, and took more than 600 recalcitrants to court.  As a result of all this, and of its own nationwide publicity campaign in 2003 (remember Ricky Tomlinson sitting on a loo in the middle of Clapham Common?), Keep Britain Tidy says its studies of sites around the country show the incidence of dog fouling has probably fallen by 40% over the last five years.  &quot;It&apos;s really been a massive reduction,&quot; says the charity&apos;s Ginette Unsworth. &quot;Things have improved beyond all recognition. Dog fouling has become much, much more socially unacceptable than it used to be. But we need to keep hammering the message home. There are still a minority of dog owners who don&apos;t get it.&quot; There certainly are - and while the amount of poo is getting less, public anger seems to be growing. Local authorities receive around 70,000 complaints a year about dog mess. Local newspapers are filled with civic outrage. Some citizens take matters into their own hands; Sally Nilsson, 43, of Reigate, organised a poster campaign by local children after trying in vain to persuade irresponsible dog-owners to clean up their pets&apos; mess by drawing chalk circles round the offending piles and adding the message, &quot;Pick this up&quot;. (The owners did so, hearteningly - then flung it into her garden). What provokes a dog-owner to behave like that? Or to scream obscenities at anyone who dares point out to them that they are in the process of breaking the law? Difficult for a non dog-owner to understand, really. Statistically, it seems men find it rather more difficult to pick up after dogs than women. Residents of social housing, too, are apparently more likely to leave their dog mess be. And obviously, if you see someone else&apos;s lying there, you&apos;re less inclined to pick up your own.  But is it laziness? Bloody-mindedness? A sudden (and, on the whole, understandable) reluctance to slide your hand into that thin plastic bag, grasp that lump of stinking, still-warm poo, then tie the bag up and walk with it to perhaps the foulest receptacle known to man: the dog waste bin?  Or perhaps it&apos;s the knowledge that if they&apos;re careful, keep their eyes peeled, let their pets out - as many do - under cover of darkness, they&apos;re unlikely to get caught? (At EDCC, the environmental health manager, Andrew Ennis, says the authority at one stage employed three uniformed dog wardens, but they &quot;never detected much&quot;. Now, the operation is &quot;intelligence-led. We rely on informants. It&apos;s much more effective.&quot;)  I spent several days looking for an unrepentant poo-dumper to answer these questions, but failed. What I did find was lots of angry dog owners fed up with being made to feel like criminals. &quot;Most dog owners are responsible,&quot; protests Caroline Kisko, the Kennel Club&apos;s secretary. &quot;There used to be embarrassment at picking up, now there&apos;s embarrassment at not picking up. It&apos;s really just a small minority, maybe 10%, ruining it for all the rest.&quot;  Often, Kisko believes, these are &quot;generally irresponsible owners, youths with their Staffordshires who are never going to be interested in picking up - people who maybe shouldn&apos;t be owning dogs anyway&quot;. But like many dog owners today, she worries that the dog control pendulum in Britain is swinging a little too far the other way. &quot;It&apos;s all a matter of attitude,&quot; she says. &quot;And, sadly, we&apos;re becoming increasingly intolerant of things we don&apos;t like in this country. There&apos;s a growing culture of belief that dogs just aren&apos;t welcome. You just don&apos;t see dogs out and about like you used to. They used to be part of the scene; now people keep them locked up at home. The result is poorly socialised dogs. And councils that just slap blanket dog bans on parks and beaches.&quot; On the Winter&apos;s Lane playing field in Ottery St Mary, threatened with just such a blanket ban, half a dozen members of Ottery Dogs have braved the January squalls to put their case. In the four months since its formation, their group has organised regular poop-scoop days, in which volunteers walk round town picking up other people&apos;s dog mess (163 piles last weekend, says member Mel Turner); opened a phone hotline residents can call to report fouling; set up a website and Facebook page; and mounted a highly effective lobbying and letter-writing campaign. The group points out that the physical and mental health benefits to many people of pet ownership in general, and dog walking in particular, are undisputed. It notes that some of the town&apos;s dog owners are elderly, or mothers with young children, and would have difficulty exercising their pets elsewhere. It says almost all the mess it clears up on its poop-scoop days is on Ottery&apos;s streets, not in its parks. &quot;We&apos;re not just a protest group,&quot; says Jeremy Bateson, its chairman an the father of two children aged five and seven. &quot;We&apos;re actively proposing solutions and seeking compromises, ways forward. We totally understand where people are coming from, we completely sympathise with their concerns. Dog mess is unpleasant. But we believe this is a cheap and easy option that is unnecessary and unfair - and it will do nothing to stop the people who are actually causing the problem.&quot; They are reasonable, responsible, sensitive people, Jeremy, Mel, Adrian, Sarah and the rest of Ottery Dogs. But I&apos;m not convinced the non-dog-owning parents of a couple of small kids will ever truly understand them. Nor, indeed, that most dog-owners will ever really comprehend that there are people out there who believe dogs are dirty and dangerous and simply shouldn&apos;t be allowed anywhere anyone else might ever want to go.  In that sense, in the land where health and safety rules, dog mess might actually be something of a defining issue. It certainly poses awkward questions: about responsibility on the one hand and tolerance on the other, about respect, and mutual consideration. In 21st-century Britain, how do we deal with questions like that? &quot;It&apos;s about people&apos;s perception of what a problem is, really,&quot; says Victoria Hall, East Devon&apos;s 22-year-old dog warden. &quot;For some people, a single dog mess is one too many. Others treat their dogs as their children; you can&apos;t say a word against them.&quot; Mark Callis, Wandsworth&apos;s dog control unit manager, has been a dog warden in London since Victoria was a baby. His team visits 40 schools a year, believing that the best way forward is to educate future dog owners. Wandsworth has sites, mainly sports facilities and playgrounds, which are barred to dogs; areas (most of them) where owners are required to pick up their pets&apos; mess; and a few where they are not.  Of course, Callis says, there will always be &quot;an element that misbehaves&quot;. But his council starts from the position that &quot;there is a place for dogs in the community&quot;, and recognises that &quot;the most frequent users of our parks and public spaces, 365 days a year, come rain or shine, on winter afternoons when there are no picnickers and no kids kicking a ball around, are dog owners.&quot; We all, reckons Callis, have rights. It&apos;s getting us to respect other people&apos;s that&apos;s not easy.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-12T00:01:00Z", "title": "Jon Henley reports from the frontline of the dog mess wars", "sentences": ["In their search for incontrovertible scientific proof, Germany&apos;s Cologne and Dresden, Vercelli in Piedmont, Italy, and Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv in Israel, have resorted to DNA testing."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/12/waste-environment-society-dog-owners"}, {"tags": ["Museums", "Education", "Science", "UK news", "Manchester", "Greater Manchester"], "article": "Quite extraordinarily, the Science Museum in London and the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry have both been made available (on 3 and 5 March respectively) for an event called &quot;Israel Day of Science&quot;. The museums argue they are not sponsoring the event, but have merely hired out their premises. This subtle distinction is unlikely to be appreciated by the many thousands of all ages and faiths who have repeatedly taken to the streets round the country to protest against Israeli war crimes in Gaza. The event is promoted by the Zionist Federation and is designed to showcase the scientific achievements of seven Israeli universities. But all of these are complicit in the Israeli occupation and in the policies and weaponry so recently deployed to such disastrous effect in Gaza. To take just one example, Tel Aviv University, in its most recent annual review, states that &quot;the Israel ministry of defence is currently funding 55 projects at TAU&quot;, which &quot;is playing a major role in enhancing Israel&apos;s security capabilities and military edge&quot;. The head of TAU&apos;s security studies programme was a former director of the R&amp;D directorate of the Israel ministry of defence. He holds the rank of major-general in the Israel Defence Forces and is a member of the Knesset. Israel Day of Science is aimed particularly at sixth-form students, who can be expected to come in parties from schools across the country. What reaction can be expected from the many young people, already disaffected from science, who will associate the science museums with this Israeli public relations exercise? The event is being billed as a celebration of science. In fact it is an attempted celebration of Israel.  In the immediate aftermath of the indiscriminate slaughter and attempted annihilation of all the infrastructure of organised society in Gaza, how can this &quot;celebration&quot; be allowed to borrow some respectability from the use of these distinguished institutions? The museums should cancel these unseemly events.Charles JencksArchitect, Historian, WriterMairead MaguireNobel Peace LaureateDr Ian Gibson MPMermber of ParliamentWalter Hain RIBAArchitectAhdaf SoueifWriterProf R.S.MacKay FRSDirector of Mathematical Interdisciplinary Research,Mathematics Institute, University of WarwickVictoria BrittainWriterReem KelaniSingerDr Jenny TongeHouse of LordsLindsey GermanConvenor of Stop the War CoalitionKarl SabbaghWriterProf Steven RoseLife Sciences, Open UniversitySabah Al-MukhtarPresident, Arab Lawyers Association (UK)John RoseCollege lecturer/ Middle East authorProf Jonathan RosenheadOperational Research, London School of EconomicsDr Monica WustemanResearch Scientist (retired)Prof Jules TownshendPolitics and Philosophy, Manchester Metropolitan UniversityMike CushmanManagement, London School of EconomicsDr. Sue BlackwellLinguistics, University of BirminghamProfessor Mohamed El - GomatiDepartment of Electronics University of YorkProf. Yosefa LoshitzkyFilm and Media Studies, University of East LondonProf. Daphne HampsonTheology, University of St AndrewsProf Peter HallwardModern European Philosophy, Middlesex UniversityProf Janet WatsonArabic Linguistics, University of SalfordProf Patrick WilliamsNottingham Trent UniversityProf Hilary RoseEmeritus Professor of Social Policy, University of BradfordProf David SeddonUniversity of East AngliaProf. Adah KayCity University, LondonProf David WieldOpen UniversityProf Mona BakerTranslation Studies, University of ManchesterProf Myriam Salama-CarrUniversity of SalfordProf Gabriel Alexander KhouryImperial College London and Padua University ItalyProf. David MondMathematics Institute, Warwick UniversityProf David E PeggBiology Department University of YorkProfessor Tariq Modood, MBE, AcSSProfessor of Sociology, Politics and Public Policy, Director, University of BristolProf Frank LandInformation Systems and Innovations, LSEProf Ailsa LandOperational Research, London School of EconomicsProf Hans Haenlein, RIBA, MBEArchitecture, University of ReadingProf Wolfgang DeckersUniversity of RichmondProf Malcolm PoveyFood Physics, University of LeedsProf Sol PicciottoLaw, Lancaster UniversityProf James DickensArabic, School of Languages, University of SalfordProf David ElworthyMathematics, University of WarwickProf Roger IredaleInternational education, University of ManchesterProf Jim Al-KhaliliProfessor of Physics, and of Public Engagement in Science, University of SurreyProf Colin GreenNorthwick Park Institute for Medical ResearchProf Haim BresheethCultural Studies, University of East LondonProf Uri DavisAl Quds University, JerusalemProf Martha MundyAnthropology, London School of EconomicsProf Paulette Pierson Mathyhon.

The former prime minister, now a Middle East peace envoy, will receive the Dan David prize for &quot;his exceptional leadership and steadfast determination in helping to engineer agreements and forge lasting solutions to areas in conflict&quot;. The award is presented by the Dan David Foundation, based at Tel Aviv University, and a spokesman for Blair said the money would be donated to the former Labour leader&apos;s charity for religious understanding, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. Blair is an envoy of the international Quartet on the Middle East peace process, which comprises the US, EU, UN and Russia. His entry as a Dan David laureate on the prize&apos;s website hails him as &quot;one of the most outstanding statesmen of our era&quot;. It praises his role in the Northern Ireland peace process and his &quot;steadfast determination and morally courageous leadership&quot; over Kosovo. But there is no mention of the divisive decision to support the US-led invasion of Iraq. Instead, the citation states: &quot;Early in his prime ministership, he came to two beliefs that guide him to today: first, that it is a mistake for the world to wait for America to solve all of the tough questions, and second, that there are some things a state may do within its borders that justify intervention even if the actions do not directly threaten another nation&apos;s interests.&quot; A condition of the award is that 10% of the prize money is used to fund graduate students in the winner&apos;s field. A spokesman for the former prime minister&apos;s office confirmed that the rest of the money would be donated to the Faith Foundation.

Opening shortly after a devastating conflict, the Peres Peace House is a venue for propagating peace and improving ties between Israel and its neighbours. Furthermore, this smart new piece of architecture is named after Shimon Peres, elder statesman of Israeli politics, Nobel peace prize laureate and founder of the Peres Centre for Peace, a successful non-governmental organisation. He is also the country&apos;s president, which complicates matters. While the Peres Centre arranges for the treatment of injured Gaza children in Israeli hospitals, Peres publicly defends the military attacks that put them there. But the Peace House could yet live up to its name. When it opens next month, the building will serve as the Peres Centre&apos;s new HQ. Its ethos is that peace in the region will be made between people, not governments, and its activities range from organising football matches between mixed Israeli and Palestinian youth teams to establishing a cross-border chamber of commerce. The new building enables the Peres Centre to host conferences, talks and arts events. It will also house Shimon Peres&apos;s personal library and archives, for the benefit of researchers and students. A one-stop peace shop, if you like. But as well as helping to achieve peace, this building had to somehow represent it - to make solid an abstract quality.  Landed with this tall but prestigious order was Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas. Though little known in Britain, Fuksas is one of Europe&apos;s most renowned architects - an expressive innovator who would rather design with a paintbrush than a computer. His work varies wildly in style but is marked by a sculptural flair that gives rise to grand gestures and memorable forms. His recent Zenith music hall in Strasbourg, for example, is a wonky drum covered in an orange membrane that lights up at night like a lantern; his huge Milan Exhibition Centre, meanwhile, is draped in a swirling roof of steel and glass.  The Peace House is another of Fuksas&apos;s poetic one-offs, although it shows an appropriate degree of restraint. It is situated on the seafront in the ancient port town of Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv, an area populated, peacefully, by both Israeli Arabs and Jews. In essence, it is simply a long box emerging out of the hillside. The short end, facing the sea, is a wall of clear glass; the other three sides are made up of thin horizontal bands of copper-green concrete and glass of various thicknesses, layered apparently randomly, like sedimentary rock. These strata, says Fuksas, allude to &quot;time and patience, the stratification of the history of two peoples&quot;. The building materials, too, represent &quot;places that have suffered heavily&quot;: solid concrete for times of stability, fragile glass for conflict and turmoil. The only clear view is out to the sea - to the future. &quot;It is the representation of an emergency,&quot; says Fuksas of the building.  It all sounds rather literal but in reality it works marvellously. On the outside, the Peace House immediately stands out as something different - monumental yet light. To enter, you walk down from the road at the top, through a landscaped park alongside the building and round to the glass front doors facing the sea. While the walls are smooth and flat on the outside, on the inside the concrete strata project out, giving the sides an undulating, almost natural texture. Light entering between these concrete slabs illuminates the space magically, even mystically. At certain times, the low sun shines into the building, casting curious shadows, but generally it is filled with a soft, diffused glow that changes with the time of day. It feels, well, peaceful.  &quot;I always try to do something I have never done before - that is my way,&quot; says Fuksas. &quot;When you do a project, the first thing it has to be is useful for its tenants, but much more importantly, it has to have alchemy - like this magical light where you cannot see its origin. Because with this alchemy you have emotion. A building without emotion is not architecture.&quot;  The most dramatic space is Peres&apos;s library, at the back of the building, on the ground floor. You&apos;re basically standing underground here, since the building is half-submerged in the hillside, but an atrium rises up the back wall to skylights in the ceiling. There&apos;s a clear metaphor here - reaching upwards from the depths - but the space is powerful enough on its own terms. The other show-stopping area, and the climax of the public route through the building, is a wood-panelled auditorium on the first floor. Rather than the usual black box, its back wall is a giant window facing the Mediterranean. &quot;If you don&apos;t want to listen to the people speaking, you can just watch the sea,&quot; says Fuksas. The Peace House feels a bit like an inhabited monument - a beautiful art installation that unfortunately had to be divided into rooms. The interior tries its best not to disrupt the overall effect, though. In places, the upper floors don&apos;t quite touch the walls, with glass filling in the gaps. The internal divisions are also glass, where possible, although there is a concrete core running through the building containing stairs and services, plus a uniquely Israeli architectural feature: a reinforced &quot;panic room&quot; on each floor, a shelter in case of bomb or gas attack. Every new building in Israel is required to have them.  Building the Peace House hasn&apos;t been easy, Fuksas says. The project began more than 10 years ago - at a time when peace in the region did not seem such a distant prospect. Then, it was a joint initiative between Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, to be situated in Tulkarem, close to the West Bank-Israeli border. After Arafat&apos;s death, it proceeded in its current form, but there were myriad problems with acquiring the site and the funding (from private donors - Peres is nothing if not well-connected). Fuksas&apos;s grand vision was not easy to translate into reality either. It was imagined that the horizontal concrete elements would be made offsite then simply stacked on to columns, like a giant child&apos;s game. But this proved to be logistically impossible. So a local architect had to work out an alternative, whereby the walls were patiently built up one layer at a time. On the metaphorical level, that&apos;s somehow appropriate.  There&apos;s still an uneasy split running through this project, though. As well as that crushing irony (Peres strives to be the big peacemaker while defending Israeli military action), the Peace House wants to be both a US-style presidential memorial library and a grassroots NGO headquarters, part gift to humanity, part vanity project. &quot;Sometimes, this fact is awkward,&quot; acknowledges Ron Pundak, the Peres Centre&apos;s director. &quot;But basically we are putting a very clear distance between his activity as president and our activities as the Peres Centre for Peace.&quot;  Pundak also admits to some discomfort about the prospect of receiving, say, a Palestinian partner from a refugee camp in his shiny new HQ. At present, the Peres Centre operates out of a nondescript office block in Tel Aviv, which is probably better suited to its activities. &quot;I won&apos;t find myself very comfortable there,&quot; says Pundak of the Peace House. &quot;But it does not reflect the Peres Centre for Peace - it reflects the vision and life and future of Mr Peres. This is the innovative approach of Mr Peres. He&apos;s not a normal politician.&quot; Nor, it bears remembering, is Israel a normal place in which to build. Architecture has almost become an instrument of warfare in this region. There is the notorious West Bank barrier, for example, which Israel has unilaterally built (and continues to build) around Palestinian areas. Israel says the barrier has improved security against cross-border terrorist attacks; Palestinians say it severs and imprisons communities, and amounts to a land grab. Architecture has also been used as a weapon in territorial disputes. Best known are the Israeli settlements that have been built across the West Bank over the last 40 years. Israelis counter that Arabs have also built up areas, particularly around Jerusalem, in order to reinforce future territorial claims, even though many of the buildings stand empty.  Above all, of course, there is the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in Gaza, and the sisyphean task of rebuilding them. In this context, the Peace House is a much-needed contrast. Whether or not it cultivates peace, it at least sends an alternative message. Fuksas is the first to acknowledge that such expressions can easily be dismissed as hopelessly idealistic - but, he adds, that doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t be making them. &quot;We must never stop thinking peace is possible,&quot; he says.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-17T00:01:00Z", "title": "Peace centre with a panic room", "sentences": ["It is situated on the seafront in the ancient port town of Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv, an area populated, peacefully, by both Israeli Arabs and Jews.", "At present, the Peres Centre operates out of a nondescript office block in Tel Aviv, which is probably better suited to its activities."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/17/peace-house-israel-architecture"}, {"tags": ["Museums", "Education", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "I write in response to the letter (16 February) calling on MOSI (Museum of Science and Industry) in Manchester to cancel the Israel Day of Science on 3 March.

Born in Jerusalem in 1939, he grew up in a right-wing Jewish nationalist environment, imbibing dreams of redemptive violence and hero-worshipping the hard men fighting the British mandate. After the founding of the state of Israel, however, he made his way as a writer on a communal farm, Kibbutz Hulda, where volunteers tilled the land while &quot;disagreeing about Trotsky in a Talmudic way&quot;, as he has put it.  Oz stayed on the kibbutz for over 30 years and emerged early on as a leading voice in the peace movement, predicting disastrous consequences soon after the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. Many of his novels and other writings, including his 2002 memoir A Tale of Love and Darkness, use the moral and political choices he faced in his boyhood to speak to the similar choices facing Israel.  Playing a role in the life of the state is a major part of Oz&apos;s self-conception as a writer, and he has weathered the scorn of both the anti-Arab right and younger, more radical Israeli leftists in the course of his career as a public intellectual. Not surprisingly, though, he has complained from time to time about the political expectations foisted on each new book. &quot;No one expected Virginia Woolf to write about the Munich agreement,&quot; he said in 2001 while promoting the English translation of The Same Sea, a novel in verse in which one of the characters - unusually for Oz - was called &quot;the Narrator&quot;, and in which politics took a back seat to tragicomic erotic entanglements. Similarly, Rhyming Life and Death, his newly translated novella, isn&apos;t, as he put it in an interview with Haaretz, &quot;Son of Love and Darkness&quot;. Like The Same Sea, with which it shares a few elements, it&apos;s an introspective, experimental piece of writing that ushers the reader behind the scenes of the fiction-making process.  &quot;These,&quot; it begins, &quot;are the most commonly asked questions. Why do you write? Why do you write the way you do?&quot; Do you use a pen or a computer? What does your wife think of your female characters? &quot;And would you please tell us, briefly and in your own words, what exactly you were trying to say in your last book?&quot; These questions are being rehearsed by a writer in his 40s, identified only as &quot;the Author&quot;, as he gears up for a public Q&amp;A session in Tel Aviv in the early 1980s. Gloomily eating an omelette in a caf\u00e9, he notices a waitress &quot;with high breasts&quot; and automatically builds a story around her. She&apos;s called Ricky, he decides, and she has unfinished business with her former lover, a reserve goalkeeper for the Bnei-Yehuda football team. More precisely, she has unfinished business with the woman he left her for - but here the Author is distracted by two men at a nearby table and starts imagining their conversation instead.  At the reading, he sketches further fictions around the cultural bureaucrat who greets him, the attentive or indifferent faces in the audience, and the critic who describes his book as &quot;a trap, a hermetically sealed chamber of mirrors&quot;. He answers the audience&apos;s questions smoothly, though &quot;he does not agree with what he is saying, and worse than that, the truth is he does not have the faintest shadow of an answer to the real, central questions&quot;.  Afterwards he makes a faltering pass at Rochele Reznik, the actress who read from his book at the event. The stories he&apos;s been dreaming up start to overlay the story of the evening, and in one version of events - we&apos;re given several - he ends up in Rochele&apos;s apartment having an unsuccessful one-night stand. It&apos;s not you, he wishes he could tell her, it&apos;s me: &quot;after all, the characters in this book are all just the author himself ... Whatever is happening to you and me is actually only happening to me.&quot;  It turns out that the Author, a character with a different biography to that of the historical Amos Oz, makes up stories out of human disconnection. Writing, for him, is a way of touching other people without being touched himself. But in one of this short novel&apos;s central paradoxes, Oz lavishes all his own storytelling powers on this remote man&apos;s imaginings about the people around him. As a result, the questions ironically shadowing the Author - and his &quot;shabby fantasies&quot; of sex with timid, cat-owning actresses - do so in a narrative filled with lovingly fleshed-out characters: a teenaged poet with tender feelings for his unlovely older neighbour; a dying lottery winner; a man of principle whose daughter is married to a settler, meaning that he&apos;ll only get to meet his grandson if he breaks a lifelong rule and visits the occupied territories. Oz also weaves in satire and a nostalgic lament for old institutions and certainties, personified by a forgotten &quot;naive poet&quot;. A few of the social nuances in the book are fairly impenetrable to a non-Israeli reader. Several of the characters are Jews of Middle Eastern background, for example, with a different status from the Ashkenazi elite, but Oz&apos;s interest in Israeli-style multiculturalism doesn&apos;t really come across in translation. I&apos;d guess, too, that his Hebrew tracks the characters&apos; spoken idioms in a way that can&apos;t easily be conveyed in English, though Nicholas de Lange, his long-term translator, has produced a text that reads well. These aren&apos;t insuperable obstacles, however, and there&apos;s plenty for us anglophone readers to enjoy: a deft way with quirky detail, a master class in interlocking character sketches, and a fable on themes of sex, death and writing pitched somewhere between the fictional universes of JM Coetzee and Milan Kundera. \u2022 Amos Oz talks to Jonathan Freedland tonight to open Jewish Book week.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-21T00:01:00Z", "title": "Review: Rhyming Life and Death by Amos Oz", "sentences": ["&quot;And would you please tell us, briefly and in your own words, what exactly you were trying to say in your last book?&quot; These questions are being rehearsed by a writer in his 40s, identified only as &quot;the Author&quot;, as he gears up for a public Q&amp;A session in Tel Aviv in the early 1980s."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/rhyming-life-and-death-review"}, {"tags": [], "article": "\u00b7 Facebook and MySpace are the superstars, but social networking sites are now so numerous as to be impossible to list.

One is that there is no magic wand, no easy, pain-free way forward. Second, it&apos;s crucial to distinguish between what you want and what you can get. As Bill Clinton and others before him discovered, they are not usually the same thing. That said, all else is fungible. Analysts who assume Obama will somehow let Arab-Israeli peacemaking define his presidency overseas are firing wide. All the indications are that his will be a &quot;realist&quot; foreign policy guided by pragmatism and self-interest, as shown by the hard-nosed message Hillary Clinton in China has just sent to the &quot;free Tibet&quot; movement. If in four years&apos; time, military confrontation with Iran has been avoided, the Iraq withdrawal has been managed honourably and without internal collapse and some kind of half-credible peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbours is in train, Obama&apos;s people will probably call it a good result. Anything more would be a bonus. As usual in the Middle East, these objectives are linked. What has been less evident until now is the degree to which improved US relations with Syria could hold the key to all three. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, certainly seems to think so. During a weekend visit to Damascus, Kerry spoke optimistically of Syria&apos;s role in reconciling Hamas and Fatah and promoting a Palestinian unity government with which Israel might be obliged to negotiate. He also claimed Syria was ready to help more on Iraqi security and on Lebanon, where the opening next month of a controversial international tribunal investigating the 2005 murder of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri will be followed by summer elections. Syria has been accused of complicity in Hariri&apos;s killing. &quot;I believe this is an important moment of change, a moment of potential transformation, not just in the relationship between the US and Syria but in the relationship of the region,&quot; said Kerry, who consulted Clinton before setting out. Pro-western Arab states are making smiley faces, too. According to Syrian media reports, Saudi Arabia&apos;s intelligence chief brought a message from King Abdullah stressing &quot;bilateral ties and the importance of consultation and co-ordination&quot; to a recent meeting with Assad. Riyadh may also return its ambassador to Damascus. Egypt is meanwhile doggedly hosting Palestinian unity talks. Interviewed by the Guardian last week, Assad also seemed in the mood to talk. He stressed American indispensability in Middle East peacemaking and encouraged Obama to redeem his offer of resumed dialogue. He said he wanted actions, not words. Officially Obama maintains the standard US positions that Syria must &quot;change its behaviour&quot; \u2013 meaning curb its backing for Hamas and Hezbollah, end political meddling in Lebanon and more closely support US objectives in Iraq and Iran. But behind the scenes, it&apos;s becoming clearer to Washington&apos;s policy reviewers that better relations with Syria would serve multiple American purposes and that, with a bit of imagination and flexibility, previous sticking points might be finessed. The US, for example, would not in practice demand an all-out Syrian break with Iran \u2013 an unrealistic aim. Rather it would look for a unilateral ending of some of their more objectionable joint activities, such as arms supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon, pending a mooted US-Iranian dialogue and a possible change of government in Tehran. Other parts of this nascent two-way bargain could include Syrian help in securing a smooth transition in Iraq; and bridge-building between Hamas and Fatah prior to the resumption of talks on a two-state solution. One theoretical offer in return is an easing of sanctions, a perhaps less judgmental view of the Hariri case, security guarantees and eventual diplomatic and economic normalisation \u2013 increasingly important given Syria&apos;s financial straits. Most intriguing of all is the possibility that Team Obama, less than enamoured with a new rightwing Israeli government led by Binyamin Netanyahu, could use improving US ties with Damascus as leverage to encourage moderate thoughts in Tel Aviv. More than anything, Assad wants the return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Netanyahu insists he cannot have it \u2013 but Obama, like some leading Israeli centrists, may feel less strongly. If, as seems likely, he obstructs the Palestinian track, the Likud leader may have to give ground elsewhere, literally. Politically speaking, Obama cannot and will not turn his back on Israel. But he may be prepared to squeeze, more so than his predecessors, primarily in pragmatic pursuit of key US regional interests.

So says the author, a lifelong Israeli journalist who has chronicled the rise of the Jewish state and who sought, in this richly accessible volume, to convey the religious nationalism, zeal and paranoia of a city whose &quot;inhabitants are poisoned by religion&quot;, and where, &quot;one hates one&apos;s fellow man to the glory of God&quot;. 2 Ropes of Sand by Wilbur Crane Eveland  An early insider&apos;s account of disillusionment, by an American spy that mirrors TE Lawrence&apos;s lament about the west&apos;s inability to keep its promises to the Arabs. Eveland is an Arabic-speaking intelligence operative who gravitates from the Eisenhower White House to the CIA, where he advises Allen Dulles on coup plotting in Syria and managing the rise of Nasser in Egypt. His narrative stands out as a sincere attempt to understand the failed American seduction of Nasser at a time when Washington wanted desperately to harness his power for the west.  3 Secret Soldier by Muki Betser  A simple soldier&apos;s story, but one of the most fabled soldiers in the Israeli army. It is not a political book: indeed, Betser confesses that he came to the conclusion that &quot;no people can rule another people without their consent&quot; and that there is no &quot;realistic alternative&quot; to sharing the land with the Palestinians. A story about overcoming fear in battle, the setting out for which &quot;takes a leap of faith to believe that you will survive&quot;. Betser tests whether the &quot;psychological mechanism&quot; that allowed him to charge the blazing muzzle of the enemy still worked after he was horribly wounded in the Battle of Karameh. 4 The Chariot of Israel by Harold Wilson An impressive exposition of the half-century of debate in the British parliament, and more broadly in the west, over the creation of the Jewish state and its first decades of war against the Arab states. Wilson, having been there for the big decisions since 1948, carries us through the Suez Crisis and the Six Day War, which broke out while he was prime minister. He does not let his sympathies for the Zionist enterprise undermine a well-balanced narrative. He brings us the voice of Lord Milner, &quot;the great imperialist proconsul,&quot; all the way from 1923 to describe the nub of it: &quot;Palestine can never be regarded as a country on the same footing as the other Arab countries. You cannot ignore all history and tradition in the matter \u2026 It is sacred land to the Arabs, but it is also a sacred land to the Jew and Christian.&quot; 5 A Tale of Love and Darkness by Amos Oz An epic story of the author&apos;s life intertwined with that of Israel. This book was given to me by the family I stay with in Tel Aviv. &quot;If you read this, you will understand everything about us,&quot; said my host. Oz&apos;s journey touches on growing up in Palestine, his richly varied extended family, his mother&apos;s long descent toward suicide and the perseverance of an irrepressibly curious intellect. As a boy, he thought &quot;that soon, in a few years, the Jews would be the majority here, and as soon as that happened we&apos;d show the whole world how to treat a minority ... It was a pretty dream.&quot; 6 Living With the Bible by Moshe Dayan Almost a coffee table book \u2013 of anthropology, images and archaeology \u2013 by the most important military commander of Israel&apos;s early decades. Dayan, the one-eyed Lord Nelson of the desert, was a predator in battle, getting close and going for the jugular. Together with David Ben-Gurion, he enabled the rise of Ariel Sharon as a practitioner of the disproportionate strike to deter Arab aggression. But in this volume, we find Dayan walking the ancient and equally brutal battlefields of the Bible. What comes through is a love of the land, of history and a deep admiration for the varied peoples of the Holy Land.  7 A People That Dwells Alone by Yaacov Herzog This collection of essays, speeches and a famous debate was pulled together by the lifelong diplomat to help explain the Zionist outlook. It is the written work of an intellectual partisan in the diplomatic arena. Its centrepiece is Herzog&apos;s debate with the British historian Arnold Toynbee in January 1961 at McGill University in Toronto. The debate turned on the question of whether there was a moral equivalence between &quot;what the Nazis did to European Jews and what the Israelis did to Palestinian Arabs&quot;. As in a good Oxford Union debate, it is difficult to turn away once engaged. 8 My Home, My Land by Abu Iyad This memoir from one of the most articulate leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (written with the French journalist Eric Rouleau) is an introduction to the world of the Palestinian resistance which sprang from the radical ranks of Cairo University in the 1950s. Here Salah Khalaf, known as Abu Iyad, first met the excitable and manic Yasser Arafat. Khalaf describes the roots of his radicalism in the experience of fleeing Jaffa, under fire, with his family. Khalaf was 15, and the family made their way down the shore to Gaza, where they lived a life of misery and despair as Israelis built a country, visible from the Palestinian refugee camps. 9 Warrior by Ariel Sharon The &quot;bulldozer&quot; of Israeli militarism tells the story of his life, sharing outsized opinions of every political fight and real-life battle. Along the way, there are many interesting stories from inside the security establishment, rivalries among the chiefs and between them and the politicians. Written with David Chanoff, Sharon charges through narrative as if he is crossing Suez, pausing periodically to floor the reader with moments of startling descriptive beauty: &quot;In the Negev, winters are mixed with pain. The clouds blow quickly through the sky, bringing showers here and there \u2013 almost always, it seems, on your neighbours&apos; fields, not yours. But you try to be quiet about it, because where rain is concerned complaints are never in order, only thanksgiving. And when the rain comes, as it always does, the land seems to be moving upwards to meet it.&quot; 10 The Iron Wall by Avi Shlaim To top off the list, here is the definitive history of Israel and the Arab world by one of the new historians, a professor of international relations at St Antony&apos;s College, Oxford, whose ruthless scholarship and crisp narrative pull all the threads loosely planted by the works cited above into a coherent skein.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-25T12:47:18Z", "title": "Patrick Tyler's top 10 'eccentric' Middle East books", "sentences": ["This book was given to me by the family I stay with in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/25/best-books-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Eurovision", "World news", "Eurovision 2009"], "article": "Israel&apos;s entry for this year&apos;s Eurovision song contest, a rare pairing of a Jewish and an Arab singer, has sparked criticism from Arab artists at a time of tense relations in the wake of the Gaza conflict. Achinoam Nini, a popular Jewish Israeli singer and peace activist, often known just as Noa, will sing a duet with Mira Awad, a well-known Arab Israeli singer and actor. The pair have worked together in the past and are rehearsing four songs in Hebrew, Arabic and English, one of which will be chosen through a television broadcast next month, before they take part in Eurovision in Moscow this May. The day after Israel launched its war on Gaza in late December, Nini, 39, was selected by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and promptly suggested she pair up with Awad, who was born in Galilee and now lives in Tel Aviv. Awad, 33, who appeared to enthusiastic reviews in a popular Israeli television sitcom last year, will be the first Arab to represent Israel at the competition. About a fifth of Israel&apos;s citizens are Arabs, who have equal rights but who for years have faced discrimination. The idea for the duo came quickly to Nini, who is a very public supporter of left-wing causes in Israel and joint Jewish-Arab organisations. However, it has provoked a sharp reaction at a time of heightened tensions both with the war in Gaza and the electoral success of a far-right Jewish politician, Avigdor Lieberman, who wants all Arab Israelis to swear an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state or lose their citizenship. A group of Arab artists, some Israeli, some Palestinian, sent Awad an open letter calling on her to withdraw from the performance. &quot;The Israeli government is sending the two of you to Moscow as part of its propaganda machine that is trying to create the appearance of Jewish-Arab coexistence under which it carriers out the daily massacre of Palestinian civilians,&quot; the letter said. &quot;Please, Mira, for the children of Gaza and for the future of every child in this land \u2014 Arabs and Jews \u2014 don&apos;t be an accomplice to the killing machine.&quot; However, the pair appear undeterred. Awad said she wanted to make the point that Jews and Arabs had no choice but to find a way to live together. &quot;It&apos;s very important for me not to go back to the corner and just disappear,&quot; she told the Associated Press. Nini said millions would be watching the duo on stage and this was their opportunity to send a message of peace. &quot;Some people will see an Arab girl who looks Jewish and a Jewish girl who looks Arab, which is what we are. Maybe it will open some people&apos;s minds,&quot; she said. Previous Israeli Eurovision contenders make an eclectic mix. Two years ago the choice was a band called the Teapacks from the southern Israeli town of Sderot, long targeted by rockets fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Their song, about the threat of terrorism, was called Push the Button. But the most successful was the transsexual known as Dana International, who swept to overall victory in 1998 with a song called Diva.", "publicationDate": "2009-02-26T12:58:36Z", "title": "Israel's Jewish and Arab Eurovision duet criticised", "sentences": ["The day after Israel launched its war on Gaza in late December, Nini, 39, was selected by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and promptly suggested she pair up with Awad, who was born in Galilee and now lives in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/26/israel-eurovison-jewish-arab-duet"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Religion"], "article": "In the wake of the devastating earthquake of 1927, the early Zionist pioneers were quick to come to the aid of the local Arab community, regardless of the political schism between the two camps. Millionaire Nathan Straus sent an unsolicited $5,000 to the residents of Nablus, where scores of homes had been levelled, while the impoverished Jews of Tel Aviv immediately despatched three truckloads of food aid to the battered city. &quot;This is the way we are,&quot; noted Chaim Shalom Halevi in a letter to his family in the Diaspora, referring to the millennia-old Jewish adherence to the commandment &quot;love thy neighbour as thyself&quot;.  As has been proved throughout the build-up to the state of Israel and in the decades since its inception, the dominant strand of Zionism does not make a comfortable bedfellow with core Jewish values, thanks to the callous way in which all those frozen between the headlights of the Zionist juggernaut are treated. Nationalism has trumped religious values to the point (seemingly) of no return, and as every year passes, the malaise seeps deeper into the collective Israeli psyche.  In order to challenge the attitudes prevalent in the camp of mainstream Zionism, the best way forward is to search for the chink in the armour \u2013 the soft underbelly where can be found those whose politics and ideologies are not fully formed, and who are open to considering a new way of thinking in relation to Israel and Zionism.  To that end, the work undertaken by a growing number of Jewish youth movements could play a pivotal role in reinventing the Zionist wheel among the next generation of Israeli and diaspora young adults. Organisations such as Sedaka Reut spawn the Hadash voters of tomorrow; NGOs like Israel Activists foment changing attitudes among the youth leaders of today.  The cracks are already starting to appear among dyed-in-the-wool Zionist movements, which for years have followed a well-trodden, conservative path of indoctrinating future immigrants to Israel. Instead of simply educating their charges in a vacuum devoid of non-Jews, and turning a blind eye to the harsh realities of the Israel/Palestine conflict, the groups of gap-year students are steered towards tackling the situation head-on, and hands-on.  Participants from Noam have just spent three months volunteering in Tel Aviv&apos;s poorest neighbourhoods, spending time working with hard-up Jewish, Arab and migrant worker communities in dire need of assistance. During that time, several ventured into the West Bank to assist Rabbis for Human Rights in their work with Palestinian farmers, or visited Israeli-Arab cities to see for themselves the corrosive effects of decades of the Zionist project.  The impact of such experiences will have lifelong ramifications for many of the students, and could well be the beginning of a sea change in diaspora Jewish thinking towards the I/P imbroglio. &quot;[This new scheme] is the start of a move away from traditional gap-year programmes,&quot; says Nat Kochan, who spent 12 weeks working with the thousands-strong community of African refugees in south Tel Aviv.  &quot;There needs to be this move, in order to open people&apos;s eyes to more than the standard Israel experience,&quot; he continues. &quot;I&apos;ve changed my views since I&apos;ve started reading about the situation and talking to people a lot more. There was suddenly a click in my head, and the &apos;Jewish-majority state&apos; didn&apos;t make sense any more; the idea that a Jew was seen as more valuable than anyone else, and the fact that people believed in \u2013 and acted for \u2013 that cause&quot;. He, along with another Noamnik, Shoshana Eilon, produced a haunting 20-minute video documentary about life for those refugees who managed to make the perilous flight from persecution in Africa to Israel. While Israel has proved far more hospitable than many other nations to those fleeing the oppression of their home countries, there is still a great deal of antipathy and animosity meted out to the refugees, both at official and street level \u2013 which the two filmmakers make crystal clear in their work.  The footage is interspersed with Biblical quotes which caustically highlight the way in which the Jewish state falls short of living up to the Jewish values on which it was ostensibly founded: &quot;The stranger that dwells among you shall be as one born among you ... for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot;  As one interviewee from the Ivory Coast notes in the film, &quot;Most Israelis were refugees once: it&apos;s crazy to see how they treat other refugees.&quot; His comment can, of course, be extrapolated far beyond the plight of those who have made it into Israel proper; the limbo in which millions of Palestinian refugees are forced to exist is a problem which will not simply disappear, no matter how hard the more ardent Zionist factions try to sweep the issue under the carpet.  Through the kind of work that Nat and Shoshana have undertaken, the gauntlet is thrown down to the previously-set-in-stone way of viewing Israeli politics, and a fierce challenge issued to the way of thinking that demands Israel be first and foremost a Jewish protectorate set up simply to serve the demands of one ethnic group. If honestly addressed, the questions raised can only lead to a more tolerant and inclusive way of thinking, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 a realisation that the best way forward for all peoples dwelling here is an egalitarian and intertwined approach to coexistence.  Sixty years of acquiescence to the old guard has done nothing to safeguard the Jewish residents of Israel, let alone the Muslims, Christians and others forced to make way for the incoming waves of olim. However, with an open-minded and fresh approach to the grim realities of life in the Holy Land, as well as a return to core Jewish values rather than a reliance on nationalism-infused sectarian ideology, there is a glimmer of light shining through the gloom. It is up to the youth leaders of today to capitalise upon that fact, if ever the true teachings of our religion are to prevail over the current cross-eyed way of approaching the land of Israel and all its inhabitants.

The prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u01e7an, has approvingly cited Atzmon during a debate with Israeli president Shimon Peres. &quot;Atzmon, a Jew himself,&quot; said Erdo\u01e7an, &quot;says that Israeli barbarity is far beyond even ordinary cruelty.&quot; Ever since, Atzmon has been getting 200 emails a day, his BlackBerry is constantly buzzing and his words are being debated by hundreds of bloggers around the world. Atzmon is revelling in the attention. &quot;A world leader quoting an artist?&quot; he laughs. &quot;Isn&apos;t that incredible? Not a singer, not even a fucking pianist, but a stupid fucking saxophonist! Ha!&quot; It may come as a surprise to some that Atzmon is a saxophonist at all. His career as a musician has long been drowned out by the clatter of his extra-curricular activities: the furious attacks on Israel (he writes and edits for the website Palestine Think Tank); the philosophical texts on Jewish identity that get discussed by the likes of Noam Chomsky; the two comic novels that have been translated into 24 languages.  However, since his arrival in London in 1994, Atzmon has also established himself as one of London&apos;s finest saxophonists. His work rate is phenomenal: he plays more than 100 dates a year, alternating between his straightahead bebop quartet and his Arabic-tinged Orient House Ensemble (named after the old PLO headquarters in east Jerusalem). As well as recording nine of his own albums, he tours and records with the Blockheads, the band he joined two years before the death of its leader, Ian Dury. He is recording a third album with another great English pop eccentric, Robert Wyatt, who describes him as &quot;one of the few musical geniuses I&apos;ve ever met&quot;. The day we meet, Atzmon is producing an album for the Dutch-Iraqi jazz singer Elizabeth Simonian; he has also recently helmed LPs by the singer-songwriter Sarah Gillespie, the afro-jazz percussionist and singer Adriano Adewale, and Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy.  This month, Atzmon launches his latest project, the album In Loving Memory of America. It&apos;s what he calls &quot;a very personal story, of how I fell in love with jazz and fell in love \u2013 and out of love \u2013 with America&quot;.  Atzmon was born in Tel Aviv in 1963, into what he describes as &quot;a conservative, secular Zionist family&quot;. During his National Service, he served as a paramedic in the Israeli army in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and started to question some of the fundamental tenets of his upbringing. &quot;I realised that I was part of a colonial state, the result of plundering and ethnic cleansing,&quot; he says. He sought solace in jazz, in particular the recordings that Charlie Parker made with a string section in the early 1950s. &quot;Charlie Parker With Strings was the first jazz album I fell in love with when I was 17,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s the record that made me want to be a jazz musician. I loved the way the music is both beautiful and subversive - they way he basks in the strings but also fights against them. Since then, I&apos;ve never been crazy about smooth jazz albums with strings, which is why I wanted to do it properly myself, to put Parker&apos;s ideas in a modern context.&quot;  The strings are orchestrated by the violinist Ros Stephen from Tango Siempre, the British tango outfit with whom Atzmon has recorded and toured recently. Despite the unorthodox setting, the project is Atzmon&apos;s most full-on &quot;jazz&quot; album since 1999&apos;s incendiary, pianoless set, Take It Or Leave It. &quot;It&apos;s true,&quot; he admits. &quot;I&apos;ve developed a reputation as a so-called jazz saxophonist, but the irony is that I rarely make jazz records these days. But I always love playing jazz because, even when I&apos;m playing it, I don&apos;t know what the next line is going to sound like. That&apos;s what makes it truthful and genuine.  &quot;That&apos;s one of the problems with a lot of contemporary jazz. Most of the young musicians I come across now are visually oriented. They learn licks by reading music from textbooks, but they don&apos;t learn the longer line. When I teach students, I tell them to put the instrument aside and learn to sing.&quot; He sings a complicated bebop line. &quot;Only then, once you&apos;ve learned to sing something, should you learn how to play it. It&apos;s like how Indian musicians learn to sing &apos;ta-ra-ta-da&apos; for years before they are allowed pick up the tabla.  &quot;I call it reverting to the primacy of the ear. Western education is very visually oriented: you play two bars of one chord, two bars of another - it&apos;s all written out in grids. I see the way my daughter learns the cello. It&apos;s codified, methodically. But there is no way to write Arabic music.&quot; He hums a melismatic Arabic phrase. &quot;There is no way you can write that down. You have to learn to internalise it before you can play it on an instrument. You have to listen. And that&apos;s where I see the overlap with politics. I see Arabic music as injecting ethics into my music. We don&apos;t listen to Arab voices. We don&apos;t listen to Hamas. We don&apos;t listen to Hezbollah, or Ahmadinejad.&quot; It doesn&apos;t take long for Atzmon to ricochet from talking about music to talking about politics, and a lengthy, furious and often hilarious argument about Islamism ensues. The problem is that trenchant politics often sit uneasily alongside music, particularly when that music is instrumental. Atzmon&apos;s musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Only one of his albums has been truly bad - his 2006 comedy klezmer project, Artie Fishel and the Promised Band, a clumsy satire on what he regards as the artificial nature of Jewish identity politics - but even his best albums have a slightly tame, homogenous feel that shares little with his blistering live performances. &quot;My albums are nothing like my live shows,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s very deliberate. I don&apos;t think that anyone can sit in a house, at home, and listen to me play a full-on bebop solo. It&apos;s too intense. My albums need to be less manic. Of course, the album as a format is dying - soon the only place anybody will sell CDs is at gigs - but they still serve as a very important document of whatever project I&apos;m working on.&quot; It is Atzmon&apos;s blunt anti-Zionism rather than his music that has given him an international profile, particularly in the Arab world, where his essays are widely read. (He favours a one-state solution in Palestine; he concedes that it will probably be controlled by Islamists, but says, &quot;That&apos;s their business.&quot;) It has also made him many enemies, even among some former allies. Some Palestinian activists see his provocatively anti-Jewish rhetoric as discrediting their cause, while the Socialist Workers party, which once proudly paraded him at conferences, has distanced itself from him. &quot;I don&apos;t give a shit, really,&quot; he says with a shrug. &quot;The Palestinian cause doesn&apos;t belong to any one person. And I don&apos;t identify with any political party. That&apos;s the advantage the artist has over the politician. The politician, like the scientist or the academic, looks at the world and tries to tell us things about ourselves. I am an artist. I look into myself and try to tell you things about the world. We push envelopes because we look into ourselves. You don&apos;t have to listen to me. You can take it or leave it. But it&apos;s my truth.&quot; \u2022 Gilad Atzmon &amp; the Orient House Ensemble and the Sigamos String Quartet play St Cyprian&apos;s Church, London, on Tuesday, then tour.

Still left in a starry-eyed daze by the effect of Obama&apos;s ascent to power, pundits took the view that the world would never again be the same since his victory, hence anything he or his entourage touched would turn inevitably and immediately to gold. The Middle East peace process, long stalled (if not furiously backpedalling) under Bush&apos;s eight-year reign, was signalled by the Obama camp as a top priority, therefore all eyes were on Clinton&apos;s inaugural trip to the Holy Land in her role as secretary of state. However, now that she&apos;s been and gone and the fanfares have died down somewhat, it is clear that \u2013 as far as the Israeli government are concerned \u2013 it&apos;s business as usual, regardless of who&apos;s calling the shots in the halls of US power. One example of the new reality mirroring the old was Clinton&apos;s feeble outburst against the demolition of Palestinian homes, in which she described the actions as simply &quot;unhelpful&quot;, a charge which was immediately rejected out of hand by Jerusalem&apos;s mayor, who scoffed at her pronouncement with all the petulance of a child complaining that mum and dad &quot;just don&apos;t get it&quot;. &quot;I totally reject the notion that we are kicking people out of their homes,&quot; he said, blaming the furore on a campaign of Palestinian &quot;disinformation&quot;. According to Mayor Barkat, the Israeli officials were merely applying the letter of the law, in an entirely even-handed fashion: &quot;If you build illegal houses you pay the consequence ... I expect people to obey the law.&quot; Ergo, Clinton is wrong, the Palestinians are wrong, and every other critic of Israel&apos;s clearly discriminatory house-demolition policy is wrong as well. By Barkat&apos;s token, the full weight of Israeli law will come crashing down on anyone \u2013 Jew or Arab \u2013 building illegally; except, of course, when it&apos;s settlers laying the foundations for hilltop outposts, or even the government itself contravening domestic and international law with every new approval it gives for construction over the Green Line. Clinton&apos;s toothless proclamations were not backed with any concrete sanctions to punish Israel&apos;s misdeeds, instead falling back on the standard American formula of expressing mild annoyance at the Israeli government in public, while privately soothing Israeli politicians, patting them on the head and sending them out to play with another year&apos;s pocket money to spend on arms, roadblocks and concrete slabs of separation wall. Of course, if the US refuses to stand up to Israel&apos;s bullying behaviour in the Middle East playground, then Britain and other interested parties aren&apos;t likely to take firm action either. The much-trumpeted cancellation of the British Embassy&apos;s tenancy agreement in Africa-Israel&apos;s Tel Aviv skyscraper is the political equivalent of a parent not giving their child a third helping of dessert as punishment for stealing a classmate&apos;s bicycle. Africa-Israel&apos;s bottom line is hardly likely to be affected in overall terms by such a paltry measure, at least not while foreign governments refuse to come good on their promises to rein in Israel&apos;s settlement expansions and land grabs in the West Bank. The chasm between political posturing and hard, meaningful measures gets wider as the years go by, since by doing nothing while Israel feverishly continues throwing up more and more obstacles in the path of the peace process, foreign governments are complicit in perpetuating the occupation. Thanks to its heavy reliance on overseas aid and trade agreements, Israel could not continue to flout international law in a vacuum \u2013 providing a golden opportunity for intervention on the part of America&apos;s Midas-man, should he be serious about following through on his promises. However, rumours of the demise of the old American approach to Israel are somewhat premature, on the basis of the Obama team&apos;s first bland foray into Israeli affairs. If the new US regime does live up to its billing, it can only be good for the long-term security and prosperity of both Israelis and Palestinians, but those looking on shouldn&apos;t be holding their breath.

But that meeting between the two men last September has become infamous as the moment when the deal was sealed for Lloyds to buy the troubled HBOS, a merger that suited both sides at the time - allowing Blank to complete a deal he had been trying to set up for two years and Gordon Brown to avert the looming collapse of a high street bank which could have wrecked confidence in the British financial system.  Six months later, there is a private acceptance even within government that the deal may have been an enormously expensive mistake and that the billions of pounds worth of bad assets against which Lloyds finally insured itself yesterday appear increasingly toxic - not just to the City, but to Brown himself. Government insiders insist it is nonsense to suggest, as one put it, that the deal was cooked up in a panic during a &quot;cocktail party conversation&quot;. The two banks had been circling each other for months before the crisis gave Lloyds a chance to pounce, and Blank and Brown had discussed the merger at least once before in July on a flight back from a trade delegation trip to Tel Aviv.  But it was the government that made the deal possible last September, by waiving competition rules. At the time, Downing Street seemed keen to highlight its involvement in saving a major bank from ruin. Now, as it emerges that more than four in every five pounds worth of bad loans put into the insurance scheme by the new Lloyds superbank came from HBOS, there will be calls for a more detailed inquiry into how closely Brown was involved in a deal that may have hobbled the black horse.  Stephen Timms, the treasury minister, yesterday admitted that the government wasn&apos;t &quot;passive, in the sense that we were very anxious to ensure that HBOS didn&apos;t collapse&quot;, although he insisted that the prime minister had not pushed the Lloyds board into anything. &quot;We took the view at the time, given the difficulties that HBOS was heading into, that it was right to waive the competition rules and allow the merger to go ahead,&quot; he told BBC Radio Four&apos;s Today programme. The scale of the toxic loans covered under the scheme has, however, shocked City insiders, particularly the \u00a3151bn of commercial and leveraged loans - much of it issued by former HBOS executive Peter Cummings. Under Cummings, HBOS became the UK&apos;s biggest commercial real estate lender, backing deals fronted by the likes of Sir Tom Hunter - the Scottish tycoon who snapped up some of the country&apos;s biggest housebuilders at the peak of the market. Many of these loans have become worthless as land and house prices have shrivelled. The \u00a374bn of residential mortgages injected also reflects the number made at high loan-to-value ratios, raising fresh questions over HBOS&apos;s lending policy.  Treasury insiders say the reason why yesterday&apos;s deal took a week longer than expected to negotiate was because Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels was determined to keep the government&apos;s shareholding below 50%. That he could not may be a signal that he could quit. The more pressing question, however, for ordinary homeowners and employees needing loans will be the degree of operational independence that the newly insured Lloyds Banking Group - and any other bank helped through the toxic assets insurance scheme - will enjoy. Can a bank that is 65% owned by the taxpayer really operate at arm&apos;s length, or will politicians inevitably pull the strings now so much taxpayers&apos; money is at risk? Treasury sources insisted yesterday that the bank would be run as a commercial concern and that ministers would not get involved in who should be on the board, despite widespread expectations in the City that either or both Daniels and Blank will go.  John Redwood, the Tory MP and former merchant banker, said the government now had a clear responsibility to intervene. &quot;If you are the owner of something that large and that risky, then you hire the people who run it and you tell them what you want them to do.&quot;  He was backed by Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, who said it &quot;must be right that when so much taxpayers&apos; money is being used to save this bank that there is effective public control.&quot; Although the Treasury insisted on Lloyds agreeing to issue \u00a328bn of lending over two years as a condition of getting help, the bank will make its own lending decisions. However, ministers now risk being dragged directly into controversial lending decisions and held accountable for any resulting job losses, with casualties of the recession likely to lobby politicians directly for help from taxpayer-controlled banks.  George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, called for a full parliamentary statement on the deal and last Thursday&apos;s historic decision to begin so-called quantitative easing - creating more money to be injected into the economy. &quot;It is shocking that the government has not been prepared to subject either of these huge decisions to proper parliamentary scrutiny,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-03-08T00:01:00Z", "title": "The 'rescue' deal that brought Lloyds to its knees", "sentences": ["The two banks had been circling each other for months before the crisis gave Lloyds a chance to pounce, and Blank and Brown had discussed the merger at least once before in July on a flight back from a trade delegation trip to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/08/lloyds-banking-group-hbos"}, {"tags": ["Google", "Internet", "Technology", "Entrepreneurs", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Technology startups"], "article": "Sergey Brin started to change the world for the first time in 1995, when he was 21 years old. Fourteen years later, he looks about to do it all over again. When the Stamford researcher working on his doctorate got together with fellow student Larry Page, Google was born. The internet search engine is now so powerful that it is a household name on every continent and, arguably, the most powerful media organisation in the world. Last week, Brin, who now lives in a big house on the southern peninsula of San Francisco, announced he is investing unspecified millions of the profits in a research programme into Parkinson&apos;s disease. This has been welcomed by the scientific community as having the potential to revolutionise medical research. It is not just money that Brin is bringing to the Parkinson&apos;s research project - it&apos;s a way of thinking about the world which has been pioneered by Google. Rather than being controlled by doctors in laboratories, and therefore limited by numbers and reliant on the time and input of a few researchers, it is being conducted through the internet. Current plans are to analyse the DNA of 10,000 Parkinson&apos;s sufferers, who will then fill out web-based questionnaires about their lives and symptoms, becoming an internet community of their own. The aim is to discover which lifestyle and genetic factors contribute to the disease. Eric Lander, director of the Broad Institute, a Massachusetts-based research centre, describes the approach as &quot;a Googley thing to do&quot;. Catherine Paddock, a doctor writing for the American website Medical News Today, considers the approach may bring about &quot;a social revolution in how research is done and who owns it&quot;. Just a few of days after the plan was announced, it is inspiring fierce debate. Scepticism has been provoked by the fact that the company carrying out the Parkinson&apos;s research, 23andMe (named after the 23 chromosome pairs every human has), is co-owned and co-managed by Sergey Brin&apos;s wife, Anne Wojcicki. Although Brin is largely financing the research, there is the potential for the company to make a profit by selling the results to drugs companies. Writing on her blog, Wojcicki explains their aim: &quot;Our approach is new because it leverages the web to bring people together from all over the globe who are willing to share infrmation about their own health experiences [phenotype], which is then combined with their genetic profile [genotype].&quot; Rival genetic research firms claim the approach can result in poor-quality data because it is reliant on amateurs reporting on themselves.  But 23andMe is not his only family connection to the enterprise. Last year, the Google founder discovered that the make up of his DNA - he has a genetic mutation - means he has a 50/50 chance of developing Parkinson&apos;s.  His mother also had the mutation, and developed Parkinson&apos;s, and he has already announced that he plans to have his four-month-old son tested to see whether he has inherited the trait. Brin is facing the discovery with the confidence of a self-made billionaire, but tempered by the down-to-earth attitude reported by colleagues throughout his career. &quot;I give it a 50/50 shot of medicine catching up to be able to deal with it,&quot; he said last week. Is Brin effectively going to be defeat Parkinson&apos;s with hard cash? Turning medical research on its head is just one of Brin&apos;s current projects. At the same time as being involved, as part of a triumvirate with co-founders Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt, with the day-to-day running of Google, his expansion plans stretch from literature - Google has hopes of digitising every book ever published - into outer space.  He is one of the founder members of the Orbital Mission Explorers Circle, set up by the space tourism company Space Adventures, which has cost him $5m in deposit, while Google has sponsored a competition to land an unmanned spacecraft on the Moon. &quot;I am a big believer in the exploration and commercial development of the space frontier and am looking forward to the possibility of going into space,&quot; he said last summer.  This is no doubt something he has inherited from his mother Eugenia, a scientist at Nasa&apos;s Goddard Space Flight Centre near Washington DC, and his father Michael, who only became a professor of mathematics because plans to study astronomy were thwarted by the university admissions policies in the USSR of the early 1970s, which discriminated against Jewish people.  A senior manager who has recently left Google tells me that Brin is also passionate about the environment. &quot;Energy is going to be a big deal for him,&quot; he says. &quot;He looks at how traditional business is done and it frustrates the hell out of him.&quot; This has led not just to his decision to upgrade his Toyota Prius to the more eco-friendly Tesla Roadster, an electric vehicle with a range of 220 miles, but also to him making an investment of at least $10m in the company that is being hailed as the future of the motor industry.  Brin was born in Moscow in August 1973. His first five years were spent in a 350 sq ft flat in Moscow shared with his grandmother, although his parents recall that he spent at least four hours a day outside, no matter what the weather. In 1977, Michael Brin travelled to Warsaw for a mathematics conference, which brought together academics from both sides of the Iron Curtain, and came back convinced of the opportunities for his family in the West.  The following year, he applied for exit visas from the Soviet Union for the family and after several tense months, during which Michael was fired from his job and Eugenia asked to leave hers, they were granted permission to leave. Their route to New York took the family first to Vienna and then to Paris, but by the end of 1979, they had settled in Maryland, bought a Ford and Sergey had started at the local Montessori school. &quot;I really enjoyed the Montessori method,&quot; he says. &quot;I could grow at my own pace.&quot; From there, he moved to the local high school and then to the University of Maryland. All this time, Brin was considered to be a bright boy by his teachers, but contemporaries do not remember him as particularly outstanding. On graduating, however, he won a place to study for a PhD in mathematics at Stanford, a private research university in California with a fearsome reputation, and in 1995, he was assigned to show around a new student named Larry Page.  A Google executive, who has asked not to be named because he regards Brin as &quot;a very private person&quot;, says that over the next days, the two students argued and talked and debated and they haven&apos;t stopped since. The idea for Google, which grew from these discussions, was based on the concept in academia that the number of times a research paper was cited by other academics provided a good guide to its importance.  By applying this reasoning to web pages, so that those most often linked to other websites should come highest in the search rankings, they came up with the plan for Google. What followed is well known to fans of technology and entrepreneurship. From the $100,000 cheque written by the Sun Systems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, payable to Google Inc, a company which did not yet exist; to the garage they rented as their first office, from Susan Wojcicki (now Brin&apos;s sister-in-law), at 232 Santa Margarita, Menlo Park; to the mass of awards that followed; to the partnership with internet service provider America Online; to the flotation on Wall Street in August 2004.  Today, Brin sits in 26th place on the Forbes list of the world&apos;s richest people, with a fortune of $12bn. Eric Schmidt, who was brought in as CEO of the company in 2001, says 98% of their revenue comes from advertising. The search engine, email service and other innovations, such as Google Maps, are, in commercial terms, just methods of attracting people to the site. Brin is, of course, no more a simple advertising man than he is a simple technical pioneer. Through his external investments and by the ever-adaptable nature of Google, Brin turns private passions into projects with real momentum. But, medical research, the private jet and space exploration aside, does he enjoy his money?  &quot;From my parents I certainly learnt to be frugal,&quot; Brin has said. &quot;I still look at prices. I try to force myself to do this less, not to be so frugal.&quot; He shops at Costco, a wholesale shop, and enjoys cooking. A friend said last week that, unlike other Silicon Valley tycoons, the decidedly un-nerdy Brin spends a lot of his downtime outside, as did the five-year-old in Moscow. Only these days, it&apos;s &quot;kitesurfing, windsurfing, diving, rollerblading, bike riding and skiing - he&apos;s a very keen skier&quot;. Brin&apos;s attitude to these athletic pursuits is described as &quot;competitive in a friendly way&quot;.  It would be tempting to say that the Earth is Brin&apos;s playground, but he has already told us that he intends to fly far higher than that. The Brin lowdown Born: 21 August 1973 in Moscow, eldest son of Michael, a mathematician, and Eugenia, a scientist. Emigrated to America in 1979. Best of times: On Google&apos;s first day of stock market trading in 2004, six years after Brin and partner Larry Page had started the company in a rented garage, shares went from $85 to $100. Worst of times: His early years in Soviet Moscow living under a cloud of unspoken antisemitism while at times both his parents were out of work. He says: &quot;Don&apos;t be evil.&quot;Google&apos;s operating philosophy.  &quot;I was told your school recently got seven out of the top 10 places in a math competition throughout all Israel.

Those who have long claimed that the sinister, shadowy forces of &quot;the Israel Lobby&quot; pull the strings of US foreign policy at last have a martyr. Last week Charles Freeman, a former diplomat, said he would not take the job he had been offered, chairing the US National Intelligence Council: he had, he said, been the victim of a campaign of &quot;character assassination&quot; conducted by an &quot;Israel Lobby [willing to] plumb the depths of dishonour and indecency&quot;. In a furious statement, he declared that the &quot;aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process&quot;. Those who in 2006 lapped up the thesis argued by the US academics John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, attributing to the mighty lobby the power to divert the US from its own interests, seized on Freeman&apos;s fall as decisive proof. Walt himself declared: &quot;For all of you out there who may have questioned whether there was a powerful &apos;Israel lobby&apos;,&quot; he blogged, &quot;think again.&quot; As the reception to the original Mearsheimer-Walt article showed, this is radioactive terrain. Those who wade in carelessly can find themselves burnt. The explanation is not complicated. The notion that Jews wield excessive power, and do so in mysterious ways; that they advance the interests of a foreign power; that they function as some kind of fifth column, and that as such they have often led their country into needless wars - all these are accusations that have been hurled at Jews going back many centuries. It should be no surprise that Jews&apos; ears prick up if they think they can hear these old tunes hammered out once more. And yet, after several conversations with Israel supporters in both Washington and Tel Aviv, I have found no one who denies that Freeman was indeed the victim of advocates for Israel. It is quite true that many on Capitol Hill disliked Freeman&apos;s devotion to Saudi Arabia, the country where he had once served as US ambassador: he recently suggested King Abdullah be renamed &quot;Abdullah the Great&quot;. True, too, that a critical blow came from Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, reportedly outraged by Freeman&apos;s overly indulgent attitude towards China&apos;s rulers. But I&apos;m reliably told that these lines of attack originated with the pro-Israel crowd. Nor have Freeman&apos;s character assassins bothered to hide their fingerprints. On the contrary, several have bragged about their role, among them Steve Rosen, a former official of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, who launched the attack on Freeman.  Surely, then, as Walt claimed, this settles not only the Freeman whodunit but the larger question of the mighty &quot;Lobby&quot;. Clearly it is every bit as vicious - and effective - as its detractors have claimed, able to derail even a new and popular administration such as Barack Obama&apos;s simply because it had the temerity to pick a man who had, among other things, condemned the Israeli occupation as &quot;brutal oppression&quot; - right? Not quite. The flaws in the Mearsheimer-Walt case remain as visible as when they were exposed by the Palestinian-American scholar Joseph Massad, Noam Chomsky and a clutch of other anti-Zionists. For one thing, if Israel and its backers really did control United States foreign policy, there would never be any divergence between them: Washington would simply do &quot;the Lobby&apos;s&quot; bidding. But that is hardly the case. One can go back to the mid-1980s, when Israel and its friends begged the Reagan administration not to sell Awacs surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia - to no avail: the Saudis got their planes. Or spool forward to 1991 when George Bush pressured Israel to attend a peace conference against its will and withheld $10bn in much-needed loan guarantees unless Israel agreed to freeze settlements on occupied land. You might mention Israel&apos;s proposed arms sales to China: Washington compelled Israel to back down, first in 2000 and again in 2005. More awkwardly, Israel has long sought the release of those who spied for it against the US. Washington has consistently refused. Chomsky asks a useful question. If the US has been led to behave the way it does in the Middle East by the cunning &quot;Israel Lobby&quot;, how come it behaves the same way elsewhere? &quot;What were &apos;the Lobbies&apos; that led to pursuing very similar policies throughout the world?&quot; As for the Middle East, Chomsky quotes the scholar Stephen Zunes: &quot;There are far more powerful interests that have a stake in what happens in the Persian Gulf region than does Aipac [or the Lobby generally], such as the oil companies, the arms industry and other special interests whose lobbying influence and campaign contributions far surpass that of the much-vaunted Zionist lobby ...&quot; The naive assumption at work here is that the American dog has no interests of its own, leaving it free to be wagged by the pro-Israel tail. It&apos;s a convenient view, casting the great superpower as a hapless, and essentially innocent, victim. But guess what: the US emphatically does have its own strategic interests - oil chief among them - and it guards them fiercely. Support for Israel as a loyal, dependable ally - ready to take on Arab and other forces that might pose a threat to those interests - has served America&apos;s purposes well. That&apos;s why the US acts the way it does, not because Aipac tells it to. Perhaps the most powerful example - if only because so many believe the reverse to be true - is the Iraq war. Plenty of Mearsheimer-Walt followers reckon it was the &quot;Lobby&quot; wot done it: it was Israel that pushed for war. But as Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and others have explained, Israel&apos;s leaders in fact repeatedly warned against an attack on Saddam, fearing it would distract from, and embolden, what it regarded as the real threat, namely Iran. As it happened, they were right. So the myth of an all-powerful Israel lobby, pulling the strings, is a delusion. But it&apos;s equally false to pretend that Aipac and its allies don&apos;t exist or exert genuine influence. They do and they play hardball, as the Freeman affair has vividly demonstrated. (Indeed, the negative publicity that has resulted may make this victory a pyrrhic one.) Viewed this way, clearly and through a lens unclouded by exaggeration and mythology, they are to be strenuously opposed. Their attempt to limit the voices heard in Washington is not just an offence against pluralism, it also hurts the very cause Aipac purports to serve: Israel. Aipac&apos;s approach - not so much pro Israel as pro the Israeli right wing - ends up pushing US politicians away from the policies Israel itself needs, specifically the dialogue with enemies and territorial concessions that are necessary if Israel&apos;s long-term future is to be secured. The good news is that alternatives are emerging. Founded last year, J Street styles itself as a &quot;pro-Israel, pro-peace&quot; advocacy organisation, thereby creating a space for those US politicians who support Israel but believe the policy of recent Israeli governments is hurting Palestinians and imperilling the future of the Jewish state. Aipac and its allies have had the monopoly on Israel advocacy for too long. Let&apos;s hope the Freeman episode prompts America&apos;s leaders to take a hard look at them, to see them as they really are: not all-powerful - and not always right either.freedland@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2009-03-18T00:01:00Z", "title": "Jonathan Freedland: Discard the mythology of 'the Israel Lobby', the reality is bad enough", "sentences": ["And yet, after several conversations with Israel supporters in both Washington and Tel Aviv, I have found no one who denies that Freeman was indeed the victim of advocates for Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/18/jonathan-freedland-israel-lobby"}, {"tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Depeche Mode"], "article": "In 2009, tuneful it may well be, but the arrival of new Depeche Mode album, Sounds Of The Universe, is not necessarily without hindrance.

We had to make the decision not to fly in and do the gig because there were missiles flying around and to make up for that we&apos;re starting this time in Tel Aviv.&quot; Actually being in Depeche Mode and performing for the first song of a medley of Depeche Mode hits as you pick up your lifetime achievement Brit award Fletch &quot;I&apos;m going to pick Wrong for this because... it&apos;s the single.

At the last minute he&apos;ll change the title and he worries I think if there&apos;s another song with the same name. I imagine him Googling it. For instance Miles Away/The Truth Is on this album was just Miles Away. Then Martin said, &apos;You know there&apos;s a Madonna song called Miles Away?&apos; So it was changed.&quot;  Falling in love with someone a) unexpectedly and b) somehow harder than ever before Dave &quot;The song Peace sounds like that.

Dave &quot;I was definitely like that. And I&apos;m not so much any more. I don&apos;t know if it comes with older age or with kids, or having to be patient about the way things evolve. A painfully obvious example would be my use of narcotics [pronounced &quot;narcodics&quot; - Occasional Americanised Word Ed] or alcohol to brighten the day, then finding myself not feeling so good the next morning.&quot;  Doing the housework, particularly in the kitchen Martin &quot;Perfect!

Actually I&apos;ve changed my mind - I think In Chains should be the soundtrack for housework.&quot;  Attending a sad funeral Fletch &quot;We&apos;d go for In Sympathy.&quot; Martin &quot;I don&apos;t think it would be a good idea to play really sad stuff at your funeral.&quot; Fletch &quot;You like sad stuff!&quot;  Martin &quot;I do. But it&apos;s making too much of a point of it, playing it at your funeral.&quot; Experiencing a somewhat naughty evening out on the town in Berlin Dave &quot;That sounds like Corrupt, which I think would have sat quite nicely on [Iggy Pop&apos;s] Lust For Life.&quot;  Martin &quot;We&apos;re back to our dark, sleazy selves on this one.&quot; How has Berlin changed since you were there in the 80s? Dave &quot;Well, they took that big bloody wall down. As we discovered, Berlin will corrupt you. (Thinks) Perhaps we wanted to be corrupted. We were looking for it and Berlin was happy to oblige.

The drone, nicknamed Zik, or spark, by the Israeli airforce is easily recognisable from its 10.5m-wide, ruler-shaped wings, tricycle-style undercarriage and V-shaped tails. It can take off from short runways or be fired into the air from a ground-based catapult and, once airborne, can be set to fly a pre-programmed route, leaving operators to focus on information relayed back by its onboard cameras and sensors. The imaging systems are housed in twin domes on the underside of the fuselage. Daytime and infra-red night video are standard, giving controllers around the clock, real-time video feeds. Most carry a laser rangefinder, automatic target tracking systems and laser illumination systems, which can highlight a target with a spot of laser light. The high-quality cameras are stabilised and vibrations that could blur images being sent back to base are minimised further by powering the drone with a smooth-running Wankel rotary engine. The drones are made of lightweight composites, but still weigh 450kg on take-off. A standard Hermes 450 can fly up to 124 miles from its base, a range set by their need to maintain a line-of-sight datalink to send images and other information back. Flight tests have been completed on more advanced versions that send data back via a satellite communications module mounted over the wing. By adding an extra fuel tank as part of its payload, maximum mission times can be extended from 20 to 30 hours. While the drones can reach an altitude of 18,000ft , they usually cruise at around 70 knots at 16,000ft, dropping to 10,000 feet to obtain video footage and still images. A version of the Hermes 450 called Watchkeeper is being developed for the British military. In June 2004, the US department of homeland security, customs and border protection used Hermes 450s to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border.

Although Ehud Barak said his Labour party was destined to go into opposition after faring badly in general elections last month, he has since been involved in negotiations with Netanyahu, head of the Likud party. Overnight the negotiators for the two sides drew up an agreement that would see Barak stay on as defence minister in the new government and would give Netanyahu a broader base of support. Although some senior Labour figures support Barak, others are opposed to the move and say Labour should go into opposition and rebuild itself as a party. Seven of the more dovish of the party&apos;s 13 elected MPs are reported to be opposed to joining the government. Labour&apos;s 1,476 central committee members are to vote on the decision later today at a meeting in Tel Aviv. In a deal reached in a hotel in Ramat Gan earlier today, Barak and Netanyahu agreed a joint platform that would commit the new government to working for a &quot;comprehensive regional agreement for peace and co-operation in the Middle East,&quot; according to the Israeli website Ynet. That appeared to be a concession to win Labour&apos;s support. Yet although it says the new government will work for peace agreements with its neighbours and will respect Israel&apos;s international agreements, there appeared to be no explicit mention of the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu has been a strong critic of the latest round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the deal five Labour MPs would be made ministers, with Barak staying on at defence. One senior Labour figure, Isaac Herzog, a minister in the current cabinet, gave his support to the deal today. &quot;A far-right government could push us to the brink of catastrophe,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the website of the Israeli newspaper Ha&apos;aretz. &quot;If it was possible for a government to be formed in which we could have a truly dramatic influence over all aspects, then I would want to be there and think that my party will not be damaged as a result&quot; However, others are bitterly opposed. &quot;They&apos;re trying to buy us off with portfolios and empty promises, but the central committee will show today that the Labour party is not up for sale and that it did not finish its historic role,&quot; said Ophir Paz-Pines, another Labour MP. If Barak loses the vote his future as leader of the party will become uncertain. But even if he wins, he may still face trouble from rebels within Labour. For Netanyahu, a deal to bring Labour into his coalition would give his government a wider base. Even though he came only second in last month&apos;s elections, Netanyahu was chosen to form a government because rightwing parties as a whole did well. Netanyahu has already signed up Avigdor Lieberman, the far-right politician, to be his foreign minister, and he has agreed a deal to bring in Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party. So far his coalition has 53 seats, still short of the 61-seat majority he needs. But it has proved harder than expected for Netanyahu to bring on side the other, smaller rightwing parties, not least because they oppose the secularism of Lieberman. In particular, the religious party United Torah Judaism is concerned about the issue of conversions to Judaism and civil marriages. If Netanyahu can secure Labour&apos;s support that would bring his coalition up to 66 seats, reducing the need for him to win over the small rightwing parties. A broader coalition might make his government less fragile and might reduce the impact of international criticism of his rightwing policies towards the Palestinians.

His comments, in a speech at an economic conference in Jerusalem, appeared designed to allay concerns about his rightwing government and comes a day after he secured the surprise support of the Labour party, which will give his ruling coalition a broader base than first expected. So far Netanyahu, long an opponent of the 1993 Oslo accords, has criticised the current round of peace talks with the Palestinians and has stopped short of endorsing the two-state solution that would see the creation of an independent Palestine. Instead he has proposed a plan of &quot;economic peace&quot; based only on investments in the West Bank. Netanyahu said peace was a &quot;common and enduring goal&quot; for Israeli governments. &quot;This means I will negotiate with the Palestinian Authority for peace,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that the Palestinians should understand that they have in our government a partner for peace, for security, for the rapid development of the Palestinian economy.&quot; However, Netanyahu&apos;s agreement with Labour yesterday contained no explicit mention of the creation of an independent Palestinian state. In addition, Netanyahu was due to meet today with leaders of the National Union party, a far-right party that is a strong supporter of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. He hopes to bring them into his coalition as well. Israel&apos;s Army Radio also reported that Netanyahu had struck a secret agreement with Avigdor Lieberman, the far-right politician who will be foreign minister in the new government, to build a controversial settlement in the West Bank in an area known as E1, east of Jerusalem. The US has strongly opposed construction in E1, where a major Israeli police station has already been built and where the land has been prepared for 3,000 housing units, together with hotels, sports centres, an industrial park and office buildings. All settlements on occupied territory are illegal under international law. The Palestinians have been severely critical of E1 and other settlements. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the new Israeli government would be judged by its actions. &quot;Any Israeli government that accepts the two-state solution, negotiates with us on all core issues without exception, and agrees to stop settlement activity \u2026 will be a partner,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s time for deeds from both sides as far as their commitments are concerned, not words.&quot; Netanyahu, who leads the Likud party, is expected to announce his new government early next week. By winning over the Labour party \u2013 which is an unlikely member of a rightwing government and which fared badly in last month&apos;s elections \u2013 he has given himself a broader base with 66 seats so far in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel&apos;s parliament. But some Labour MPs are so angry that their party has joined his coalition that they may yet refuse to vote in support of the new government. It means a coalition government of uncomfortable alliances drawn from across the political spectrum which embraces Lieberman and now Ehud Barak, head of the left of centre Labour party. Barak is to remain in his post as defence minister, where he was a key figure behind Israel&apos;s latest three-week war in Gaza. &quot;I am not afraid of Binyamin Netanyahu,&quot; Barak told his party yesterday. &quot;We will not serve as anyone&apos;s fig leaf.

Aged 16 she was confronted in front of her class by a history teacher and was asked to explain Israel&apos;s conduct. As a typical teenager more interested in fashion than foreign policy she was horrified to be put in the spotlight to represent a foreign country and one that she had little affiliation to. This singling out betrays a view still common now. British Jews are seen as representative of, and responsible for, Israel&apos;s actions. But many of the young today like myself \u2013 second, third or fourth generation \u2013 see themselves as British and Jewish. And British and Jewish only. This does not mean we are affiliated to Israel by default.  Many Jews here do of course have links to Israel. My uncle moved there in his 30s, bringing up his two children in Tel Aviv. Both my cousins, one my own age, have served in the army. My great-great uncle, the English banker and philanthropist Sir Moses Montefiore, played a founding role in building the first Jewish settlements outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem. Israel does have much to be proud of and has a place in history as the only democracy in the Middle East. But whether its recent actions have been right or wrong is beside the point. British Jews should not be held responsible for Israel unless they choose to be. They, after all, are not its voters or citizens. Despite my own connections and history, what I really want is to be free from having to explain, to justify, to comment on or condemn Israel&apos;s actions.  Let me tell you a small anecdote from Dr Jonathan Romain, minister of the Maidenhead Synagogue in Berkshire, to illustrate this conundrum. During the recent Israel-Gaza conflict some members of the public called Romain to ask: &quot;Why are you doing such terrible things in Israel?&quot; He answered: &quot;It is not me who is doing it.&quot; The rabbi sees himself first and foremost as a British Jew. And this does not make him de facto Israeli. He illustrates this in a simple analogy about reading the papers: &quot;I first of all read the front page to get the news, then the back page to get the sport. Finally, I turn to the foreign pages to read about Israel.&quot; The message is clear. Israel is a concern but never higher on his day to day agenda than home news and issues.  The question is, would a teacher dare to confront a second-generation Pakistani boy at school to explain why the Mumbai attacks happened? Would members of the public ring a British-Pakistani imam to demand answers? Of course not, and rightly so. The idea is preposterous and offensive. British Pakistanis here have no more control over actions of individuals from Pakistan or the Pakistani government than British Jews have over the Israeli government. At a time like this Israel is neither fashionable nor liked. Lay members and rabbis alike find themselves answerable for what Israel does and doesn&apos;t do \u2013 in the press, in work, in friendship circles and at school. The most recent conflict has inevitably magnified perceptions of British Jewry&apos;s alliance with Israel. This year alone there have been more than 150 reported cases of antisemitism, making 2009 the worst year since records began a quarter of a century ago. And we are only in March. But the Jewish population here must not be held responsible for Israel&apos;s decisions there.  There are, of course, many here who do support Israel wholeheartedly and without reserve, seeing it as their homeland. In her blog, columnist Melanie Phillips takes this a step further by calling &quot;self-hating Jews&quot; who publicly criticise Israel &quot;beneath contempt&quot;. According to Phillips &quot;the destruction of Israel and genocide against the Jews is advanced every time a Jew-hating Jew spews such venom into the public sphere&quot;.  That Phillips feels the need to spitefully attack fellow members of the community is sad. But both she and the Jews who publicly criticise Israel have one thing in common. Both factions \u2013 although opposite in views and ideology \u2013 assume that Jews are deeply and irretrievably tied to Israel. But I believe we have a right to choose whether we are answerable for \u2013 or even associated with \u2013 Israel&apos;s actions. And I choose to abstain. \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday March 27 2009. We made an erroneous reference to an article by Geoffrey Alderman (which can be read here).

Ancient, crumbling buildings stand alongside once-proud but ill-maintained Bauhaus apartment blocks; springing up in their midst like flowers straining for sunlight are ultra-modern, glass-walled homes for Israel&apos;s nouveau-riche.  Designer boutiques make unlikely bedfellows with metal-beaters&apos; workshops in dusty, sun-bleached backstreets, and the weekend shoppers are a curious mix of cash-rich yuppie couples and down-at-heel families seeking cheap bargains in the teeming flea market.  However, the starkest sign of Jaffa&apos;s unique status is its combination of Jewish and Arab residents, who refuse to bow to the divisive mindset so prevalent in the rest of the country. While Jaffa is not without its problems on a macro scale, at a day-to-day level the locals make the best of the situation, coexisting in relative harmony.  Fadi Shbita, director of Sadaka Reut, the Jaffa-based &quot;Arab-Jewish Partnership&quot;, works tirelessly to foment mutual understanding between his teenage charges, and believes that only through such first-hand experiences will the next generation opt for a more tolerant approach to their fellow citizens. &quot;We don&apos;t advocate policies such as where to draw borders, and so on,&quot; he explains. &quot;All we say is that both people have rights here, and that they need to be treated equally.&quot; However, just because the residents of Jaffa are happy to live and let live does not mean that the authorities are content to play along too \u2013 as I discovered once again at the end of last week.  It was another stunning Friday by the coast: sun bathing the city in brilliant light, the slightest hint of a breeze rustling the palms by my window. After arranging to meet my friends for lunch by the beach, I set off for my daily five-mile walk through Ajame and Bat Yam. iPod in, trainers on, I ducked out the front door and made a beeline for the promenade. Not a care in the world, not a cloud in the sky \u2013 and so it remained till the home straight, as I glided down the gentle slope of Shivtei Yisrael Street.  Propelled along the pavement by thoughts of another shot of coffee on my return, I caught sight of a dirty grey SUV up ahead, blocking half the road with its presence, handbrake on and engine purring. As I drew closer to the jeep, an all-too-familiar scene unfolded before my eyes: two crop-haired border policemen forcing an Arab youth up against the driver&apos;s door.  Pistol protruding from the tight waistband of his taut trousers, the more vocal of the pair cuffed the detainee round the face, while his partner stared with dead eyes at the unprovoked attack. I was six feet away from the scene of the crime by now, and stopped dead in my tracks to watch what happened next. Turning towards me with measured deliberation, the fist-happy policeman fixed me with his piercing, narrowed eyes. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; he drawled, as I held his gaze and stayed rooted to the spot.  A middle-aged Arab man appeared alongside us, attracting my interlocutor&apos;s attention as well as that of his colleague. &quot;Why did you hit him?&quot; asked the new arrival in flat, halting Hebrew. &quot;I didn&apos;t touch him,&quot; deadpanned the Magavnik, his lips curled in a sneer as he lied through his teeth.  The victim&apos;s face told another story. A bruise was already forming below his eye, and the trembling gait of the clearly mentally disabled teenager gave away the fear coursing through his veins. The policemen continued their bullying of the youth, utterly unconcerned by the fact that several bystanders had been witness to the broad-daylight assault. The standoff continued for several minutes, during which I took photos of the trio on my phone, and the Arab observer tried to plead for the youth&apos;s release.  Eventually, the policemen tired of their sport, doling out menacing stares matched with menacing words to those of us looking on, while the boy collapsed in a heap of tears and torment into the arms of the older man. People gathered round to offer their sympathy, while simultaneously issuing curses against the assailants and prayers for cessation to the endless harassment taking place on their streets.

Although Zionism was born and developed in Europe, up to 3.5 million Israelis trace their roots back to Arab lands \u2013 in fact, until the early 1990s, these Mizrahim and Sephardim, as they are known, made up the majority of Israel&apos;s population. Not the Enemy by Rachel Shabi, herself an Israeli of Iraqi Jewish ancestry, provides a fascinating account of the personal stories and history of Mizrahi Jews, whose world fell into the abyss of the Arab-Israeli conflict, while their dual identities as Arabs and Jews proved unable to bridge the ever-widening chasm.  &quot;The absence of the Mizrahi face from the global snapshot of Israel feeds back into a polarised position, serving those on both sides who favour the dichotomous formula of Arab versus Jew,&quot; writes Shabi, who is also a regular contributor to the Guardian. Even though I knew about Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews beforehand, I was, nevertheless, rather surprised by how Middle Eastern Israel seemed when I was there a couple of years ago. In fact, my first encounter was with a Moroccan Jewish taxi driver who could shame any Cairo cabbie with his use of curses and expletives and his love of Umm Kalthoum, the Arab world&apos;s legendary singing diva. Subsequently, I met numerous Mizrahi Jews, including a colourful oud player called Murad (Mordechai), nearly all of whom recalled fondly their previous lives before coming to Israel. These encounters sparked a fascination in me to learn more about their history and tragic plight, and Shabi&apos;s book compellingly fleshes out how Middle Eastern Jews were first yanked out of Arab lands and then had the Arab yanked out of them in Israel. Shabi documents the ironic descent of Arab Jews from generally well-integrated and successful minorities at the very heart of Arab culture, politics and business to a relatively marginalised and disadvantaged population in Israel. Through a mix of personal narratives and historical research, the book examines how, despite its pseudo-messianic pledge to provide salvation for Jews, Zionism actually hurt Middle Eastern Jews as Arabs eventually committed the monumental crime \u2013 and one for which they should apologise \u2013 of equating Judaism with Zionism and started viewing their Jewish populations as &quot;enemies within&quot;. In fact, some Mizrahi are very blunt about the link between Zionism and their plight. &quot;If Israel had not been established, nothing would&apos;ve happened to the Iraqi Jews,&quot; opines the Iraqi-Jewish poet Me&apos;ir Basri. But the suspicion and distrust did not end there. Their resemblance to Arabs \u2013 in fact, you could argue that they are also &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; \u2013 in everything but religion caused them to be viewed with a mixture of condescension, contempt and even fear. This kind of culture shock is, at one level, understandable, as it is a myth to expect the simple fact of belonging to a single faith automatically means that people are the same. &quot;We have here a people whose primitiveness sets a record,&quot; wrote a Ha&apos;aretz reporter in 1948, not of the Palestinians, but of Mizrahi refugees. This anti-Mizrahi prejudice among the Ashkenazi elite (European Jews) translated into them being whisked away to live in the remotest parts of Israel and populate what are known as &quot;development towns&quot; that failed to develop into anything beyond a receptacle for broken promises and shattered dreams. The Ashkenazi elite also set about &quot;civilising&quot; the Mizrahi Jews and shaping them into modern &quot;Israelis&quot;. Of course, to a certain extent, this happened to all immigrants, but since the Ashkenazi were calling the shots, it was their culture that most influenced the Israeli ideal.  Today, mizrahim still make up the bulk of Israel&apos;s poor and undereducated; they are often stereotyped in the media as pimps, hustlers and whores; their culture is seen as somewhat inferior; and their accent, although it is the more accurate form of Hebrew, is scorned. Although the disappeared Jewish presence in Arab lands was not a paradise lost, their migration to Israel was not a paradise found either. Despite certain episodes of oppression, such as the persecution instigated by the fanatical Almohads in North Africa and Spain in the 12th century, Arab Jews were an integral component of the region&apos;s cultural, social and economic fabric.  This was especially the case in Iraq, which arguably had the world&apos;s oldest continuous Jewish presence. Babylonian Jews \u2013 who once made up to one in four of Baghdad&apos;s population \u2013 were significant players in every walk of life, including politics, the arts, music and business.  Could this common cultural heritage and affinity aid the quest for peace with the Arabs \u2013 what Shabi calls the &quot;Mizrahi bridge hypothesis&quot;? She once hoped it could, but her research led her to abandon it. Despite all the signs to the contrary, I wouldn&apos;t be so quick to dismiss the potential role Mizrahi Jews could play in building understanding and empathy. The fact that they are more likely to be ultra-nationalistic, ultra-conservative and ultra-right wing than Ashkenazis is partly due to their sense of betrayal at the hands of the Arab world and Israel alike. But as new generations of Mizrahi Jews discover a renewed pride in their heritage, this could lead to further corrosion of the simplistic polarity of the official narratives of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This, in turn, could prompt more dialogue with Arabs, which could eventually build the kind of understanding required to provide a solid foundation for peace. Moreover, the Mizrahi experience resembles that of the Palestinians, and this is increasingly leading to joint activism at the grassroots level, such as when Israeli Arabs joined Mizrahi Jews protesting eviction in a village on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, even though it had once been a Palestinian village. In addition, a vocal Mizrahi minority have been at the forefront of the peace movement for decades. For instance, it was a Mizrahi organisation, the radical Black Panthers, which was the first Israeli group to recognise the PLO, and a couple of years before the Madrid peace conference, Arab Jewish and Palestinian politicians, writers and academics held their own informal peace conference in the Spanish city of Toledo. And even if it is misguided to believe that the chasm can be bridged, those who wish to work for peace and coexistence must continue to stretch as far across it as they can. As Sasson Somekh, the Iraqi-born professor of Arabic literature and long-time friend of the late Egyptian Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, expressed it: &quot;I am aware that I did not produce any important results, but I&apos;m not going to stop.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T09:00:02Z", "title": "Khaled Diab: Like the Palestinians, Middle Eastern Jews have fallen victim to political forces beyond their control", "sentences": ["Moreover, the Mizrahi experience resembles that of the Palestinians, and this is increasingly leading to joint activism at the grassroots level, such as when Israeli Arabs joined Mizrahi Jews protesting eviction in a village on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, even though it had once been a Palestinian village."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/01/middle-east-israel-mizrahi"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Judaism", "Religion"], "article": "It all began promisingly. A former congregant of mine works for an international crisis agency in Jerusalem, regularly commuting between Israel and Gaza. When I told him that I was coming to Jerusalem for a conference, he offered to liaise with UNRWA to organise a Gaza visit. I jumped at the offer. Hardly any Jews apart from Israeli military have been in Gaza since Operation Cast Lead. Along with the serious objective of seeing for myself the consequences of the invasion, there was the less worthy motive of one-upping colleagues and acquaintances. I decided to let another rabbi, Danny Rich, the executive director of Liberal Judaism in the UK, share my potential coup. From London we filled in the necessary application forms. UNRWA warned that the standard waiting time for permission to enter Gaza is currently 8-10 days, and rarely for the day specified, but they were cautiously optimistic. Once in Jerusalem, our chosen day came and went, with no word. Deflated, we made our way to the second half of the conference in Tel Aviv. The following day was the Sabbath, when everything official is closed down in Israel. I had resigned myself to spending Sunday at the conference, but early in the morning my congregant rang to say that permission had come through, our visit was on. He picked Danny and me up and drove us to the Erez crossing. The scenery becomes bleaker and more arid the nearer one gets to Gaza. After Yad Mordekhai, a kibbutz famous for its resistance in the 1948 war of independence, dual carriageway dwindles to narrow military roads. Erez suddenly looms up, with its signboard proclaiming in Hebrew, English and Arabic: &quot;Welcome to the Erez border crossing.&quot; The vast car park was almost empty. Walking past breeze-blocks to passport control under the gaze of lounging security guards in T-shirts and sunglasses, assault rifles dangling at their hips, I felt like an extra in a Sam Peckinpah movie set in Mexico. As with most services in modern society, border security too has been outsourced, to a Russian-owned firm called &quot;White Snow.&quot; A sound choice. Russia and Israel are both countries where it takes even longer to get out than to get in. Two Palestinians were ahead of us at passport control. The bored girl in the booth told them to empty out their suitcases. They complied with the ingratiating desire to please of migrants at border crossings all over the world. The contents were mostly children&apos;s clothes and toys; nothing to confiscate or even query. The bored girl motioned them towards the barrier. In their relief to be on their way the Palestinians shovelled everything higgledy-piggledy back into the cases. We handed over our passports. The girl checked against a list and made a telephone call. &quot;It usually takes about an hour to get through&quot;, said my congregant. &quot;More than that and there&apos;s a problem.&quot; We ate a sandwich and chatted. It was pleasant in the afternoon sunshine. Eventually a young officer came through the barrier. &quot;David Goldberg?&quot; he called, and asked me if I spoke Hebrew. &quot;Yes&quot; I replied, and immediately regretted my vanity. Long experience dealing with Russian immigration officials in the 1980s when visiting refusniks and regular tussles since with Italian bureaucracy have taught me that you retain the upper hand by speaking your own language. But the officer was pleasant enough, slim, personable and softly-spoken. He explained that the situation in Gaza was complex. Did we understand that entering was our responsibility, Israel would not guarantee our safety? We nodded. Then he said, puzzled: &quot;It says here you are rabbis. But why no beards and head covering?&quot; I promised to explain the differences between Orthodox and Progressive Judaism when we returned. About 20 minutes later he came back with two waiver forms in Hebrew, absolving the Israeli authorities of any obligations. We signed them. &quot;Good, that&apos;s almost everything.&quot; Off he went again. The monotony of waiting was broken when a black coup\u00e9, driven at speed with its stereo blaring, barrelled up the hill towards us. It stopped a few metres short of the barrier in a screech of tyres. The driver, short, balding and stocky, with an Uzi submachine gun over his shoulder, got out and said something to the girl in the booth. The barrier lifted. He swaggered back to his car, gunned the engine until the back wheels skidded in protest, and careered a few metres round a bend to the next check-post. We laughed at such an exuberant display of machismo, for no one in particular. Toting a gun makes the least likely individuals cocky. More aimless waiting. Then the barrier lifted again, and a brown army car driven by our officer sped down the hill towards the Ashkelon road. &quot;That&apos;s a bad sign&quot; said my congregant, &quot;he didn&apos;t say goodbye.&quot; But a few minutes later we watched the dust plume of his returning car. Hope renewed. He stopped near us, walked over, and said in excellent English: &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but we can&apos;t let you in. Everything is in order, but we&apos;ve had security information that makes it dangerous for you to enter. It&apos;s for your own sake, please don&apos;t take it personally.&quot; He shook hands and gave the practised smile of someone bound for the diplomatic corps when his army service is done. Our contacts on both sides of the crossing exchanged angry phone calls. Apparently it was the first time that an application had been granted, then rescinded at the border. When an UNRWA official made high-level enquiries, she was told something about a kidnap threat, Danny and I were well-known communal figures. It sounded flattering but unlikely. If we are well-known, it is for our public criticisms of Israeli policy in the Occupied Territories. In which case, why give us permission to enter Gaza in the first place? On the other hand, a terrorist car bomb had luckily failed in Haifa the night before, and twelve Hamas officials had been re-arrested in the West Bank that morning. Trying to unravel the complexities of Israeli-Palestinian relations can drive one paranoid. But whatever the reason, there was no getting into Gaza that day.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T14:30:00Z", "title": "David Goldberg: I wanted to be among the few civilian Jews to visit Gaza since the invasion.

Raphael Cohen instigated legal proceedings against the weekly newspaper after it published a letter in November 2008 alleging he had sheltered the bombers five days before they blew up a Tel Aviv bar. Cohen&apos;s solicitor, Stephen Loughrey, told Justice Eady the letter suggested that his client was knowingly involved in the &quot;atrocious crime&quot; that occurred in April 2003, when three people were killed and 50 injured. Loughrey added that Cohen, who is a British citizen currently working as a lexicographer in Cairo, did not &quot;harbour&quot; the bombers. The Jewish Chronicle, Loughrey said, now accepted the allegations were false and should never have been published. A British passport holder, Asif Mohammed Hanif, died in the attack on Mike&apos;s Place on the Tel Aviv waterfront in April 2003. His accomplice, another British national, Omar Khan Sharif, escaped the scene but was found dead in the sea days later. Loughrey admitted that Cohen had met the pair briefly by chance at a memorial ceremony held five days before the bombing. However, he added that his client did not know them and certainly had no idea, or grounds to suspect, that they planned such an attack. The Jewish Chronicle apologised for the distress and embarrassment caused and agreed to pay Cohen undisclosed damages and legal costs. Solicitor Lindsay Hodgkinson, acting on behalf of the Jewish Chronicle, said it welcomed the opportunity to set the record straight. Cohen is donating a substantial proportion of the damages to charities providing humanitarian relief to the Palestinian people. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The festival of Passover marks the emancipation of the Jewish people from the yoke of slavery in Egypt, but it is not enough to retell the Exodus story as though reciting historical facts and figures by rote.  This weekend, in downtown Tel Aviv, a 1,000-strong gathering in Levinsky Park demonstrated precisely the way in which core Jewish values ought be applied to the plight of the &quot;strangers in our midst&quot;. Spearheaded by Amnesty International,  Israel Activists and other local NGOs, a huge event was held to highlight the predicament of the 17,000 Africans currently in Israel seeking refuge from persecution.  While Israel has proved a more benign sanctuary than neighbouring Arab countries for those fleeing genocide in Darfur, Congo and Eritrea, the government&apos;s treatment of the refugees still falls well short of the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which it is a signatory.  Other than granting asylum to the masses making the perilous journey from their war-torn homes, Israel has barely lifted a finger to address their needs. Instead, most of those crossing into Israel are denied work permits or access to healthcare, and often spend months behind bars in desert detention centres.  However, while Israeli officialdom is largely indifferent to the refugees&apos; pleas for help, many ordinary Israelis (applying the cultural values with which they have been inculcated) have taken up the Africans&apos; cause. Those assisting the refugee community feel compelled to act precisely because Jews have suffered similar mistreatment throughout history when fleeing oppression, believing that Israeli Jews should remember their own troubled past when dealing with the victims of today. Using the model of the traditional Passover gathering, when families retell the legend of the flight from Egypt round the dining table, the volunteers organised a modern-day Seder to link the Africans&apos; exodus to that of the ancient Jews. While almost 600 refugees participated in the proceedings, the event was as much to bring their cause to the attention of native Israelis as it was to reassure the migrants that they are not alone in their struggle.  It was for just this reason that the Seder was held in Levinsky Park, an expanse of grass and asphalt notorious for its regular crowd of drunks, junkies, prostitutes and down-and-outs \u2013 many of whom were in attendance on the day, and only too happy to join in the festivities. A gala, black-tie fundraiser would have had none of the impact of an event in the belly of the beast, since the plight of those living rough in and around Levinsky has to be seen to be believed.  When a five-man group of wasted alcoholics decided to crash the stage and treat the crowd to their frenzied dancing, organiser Nic Schlagman noted: &quot;There&apos;s no way they trekked here from Darfur in that condition; only the most dedicated and determined made it all the way from Sudan in one piece. What kind of system have we got in place here that forces them to find salvation at the bottom of a whisky bottle after all the effort they made to get here?&quot; Local traders, businessmen and residents were all eager to lend a hand or contribute food to the Seder, while passers-by and press alike took a keen interest in the impassioned speeches delivered by the heads of the refugee community. As a way of bringing the message to the streets, there was no better way than this \u2013 especially with Passover less than a week away.  In Israel, Passover is the most widely-celebrated of all Jewish festivals, with even the most secular families using the opportunity to gather their offspring together and engage in the festive atmosphere sweeping the country. However, as Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg pointed out so adroitly in a recent sermon, &quot;I love every aspect of [Passover], even the cleaning, even the steam rising from boiling cutlery in the process of being made kosher. But unless we care for the greater freedom of Israel and its neighbours, and say so, it all feels... as if it&apos;s tainted by hypocrisy&quot;. Israel&apos;s track record of dealing with refugees is pretty woeful \u2013 not least in relation to those of its own making. However, just because the state makes little to no provision for dealing with the strangers in their midst does not mean all Israelis can be tarred with the same brush.  Events such as the &quot;Out of Egypt&quot; Seder demonstrate the commitment of many Israelis to improving the status quo, regardless of the example set by their leaders. But until such commitment to fighting injustice is replicated in the upper echelons of Israeli power, then rather than learning the lessons of its people&apos;s history, Israel is condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T09:30:00Z", "title": "Seth Freedman: An event in Tel Aviv to highlight the plight of refugees was inspired by a Passover ritual", "sentences": ["This weekend, in downtown Tel Aviv, a 1,000-strong gathering in Levinsky Park demonstrated precisely the way in which core Jewish values ought be applied to the plight of the &quot;strangers in our midst&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/06/judaism-israel"}, {"tags": ["Sir Michael Lyons", "BBC", "Television industry", "Media", "BBC Trust", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Sir Michael Lyons, chairman of the BBC Trust, has dismissed claims that his body was seeking to undermine credibility of BBC News by upholding complaints against its Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen as &quot;utterly false&quot; and &quot;baffling&quot;. Lyons sought to play down critical reaction to Wednesday&apos;s ruling by the BBC Trust editorial standards committee, which upheld in full or in part three complaints relating to an edition of Radio 4&apos;s From Our Own Correspondent and a BBC News website report, both by Bowen. Yesterday the Independent splashed on the trust&apos;s ruling with a story claiming it had &quot;called into question the corporation&apos;s reporting of the most sensitive news story of modern times&quot;, which it said had caused anger in the BBC and led to allegations that it was undermining the credibility of its news. Responding in the Independent today, Lyons criticised those suggestions, saying that the trust had seen no evidence that demonstrated systematic bias in the BBC&apos;s reporting of the conflict in the Middle East. Lyons added that Bowen had breached accuracy and impartiality guidelines &quot;in two isolated news items&quot;. It was not the case that everything in those reports was inaccurate and partial, he said, but the BBC Trust had a duty to licence fee payers to investigate the complaints. &quot;It was not a judgment on his [Bowen&apos;s] role and responsibilities as Middle East editor, for which he rightly has a high reputation and has received widespread respect. And it was not a finding against BBC journalists in general,&quot; Lyons wrote. &quot;So the idea that the BBC Trust is seeking to undermine the credibility of the BBC News, as reported in yesterday&apos;s Independent, in not just utterly false, but also baffling. &quot;I am puzzled by what possible motivation the BBC Trust \u2013 which is there to strengthen the BBC on behalf of those who pay for it \u2013 would have in doing this.&quot; The trust ruling provided ammunition for critics of the BBC&apos;s Middle East coverage, with the Tel Aviv-based newspaper Haaretz claiming that the findings showed the corporation had an anti-Israel bias and that Bowen&apos;s position was &quot;untenable&quot;. In its ruling this week, the BBC Trust passed verdict on one complaint about Bowen&apos;s January 2008 report for From Our Own Correspondent from the Israeli settlement of Har Homa, near Jerusalem, which had alleged that it was biased against Israelis and contained a number of inaccuracies. Bowen&apos;s Har Homa report was cleared by the trust over impartiality. However, the BBC&apos;s regulatory and governance body partially upheld the complaint with regard to accuracy, saying that Bowen had not properly sourced his assertion that the settlement was considered illegal by the US. The trust also received two complaints claiming that a June 2007 website report, headlined &quot;How 1967 defined the Middle East&quot;, in which Bowen described the legacy of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, contained inaccuracies and was biased against Israel. One complaint about this online report was partially upheld by the BBC Trust on the grounds of both accuracy and impartiality, with the trust ruling that Bowen should have used clearer language and been more precise in some aspects of the piece. The trust upheld the second complaint with regard to impartiality and partially upheld it with regard to accuracy on a number of the same grounds and also on the basis that Bowen&apos;s statement that &quot;the Israeli generals \u2026 had been training to finish the unfinished business of Israel&apos;s independence war of 1948 for most of their careers&quot; had been imprecise. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

What we are witnessing is not - or not yet - a love affair; it&apos;s a psychotherapy session, the very first scene of In Treatment, an innovative and prolific HBO TV drama now in its second season in the US. Last year, five half-hour episodes were aired every week for nine weeks - a marathon in TV terms, yet barely a dent in the amount of listening a real psychotherapist has to do. Each episode was a single patient&apos;s session - Laura on Mondays, Alex on Tuesdays, Sophie on Wednesdays, Jake and Amy on Thursdays. On the fifth day, the therapist himself would see his old supervisor, so that the last patient was always the doctor, offering a post-mortem on the week from a shifted point of view. Before it aired, the prospect seemed a little worrying, both to TV critics - one of whom suggested that electroshock treatment might be more welcome than having to sit through it all - and to the show&apos;s producers. Steve Levinson, who is one of them, says: &quot;I knew the format was ground-breaking. Being the first show HBO aired five nights a week was certainly a bit daunting, but also exciting.&quot; In the end, it became hugely admired by both viewers - many psychotherapists among them - and critics. &quot;This show is smart and rigorous, with a concentration that bores deep... an irresistible peek at the psychopathology of everyday life,&quot; said the New York Times, while, to the Boston Globe, it proved that &quot;HBO is still trying to break new ground&quot;. Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, who gives a virtuosically nuanced lead performance as Dr Paul Weston, was awarded a Golden Globe. In Treatment has become the latest coup for a cable channel that has bred nothing but hits for the past decade. The Sopranos (which opened with another shrink&apos;s office), Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Six Feet Under and, more recently, The Wire all found a home at HBO, a channel that started out in 1972 with a view to showing uninterrupted movies in people&apos;s living rooms (HBO stands for home box office). Because of its subscription basis, it is unperturbed, unlike the networks, by advertising or viewing figures, and has been liberated into backing what have often initially seemed like risky projects, The Sopranos being the most legendary. With the advent of HBO On Demand, a series like In Treatment has met its medium: any session of any patient can be ordered to view at will. Very closely based on an Israeli TV series (Be&apos;Tipul) that first aired four years ago, the appeal of In Treatment stems from its sophistication. Many of the show&apos;s writers are playwrights (the Tony award-winning playwright Warren Leight is the &quot;show runner&quot; for the second season, executive producing and heading the writing team), and rather than try to make the encounters artificially dramatic in conventional TV terms, they embrace the limitations of the consulting room. &quot;Playwrights are limited by the four walls of a theatre, unlike television and film,&quot; Levinson explains. &quot;Because the scale of this show is so intimate - two or three actors in a room - it has a similar quality that playwrights are already familiar with.&quot; Or, as one of the show&apos;s writers, Marsha Norman, put it: &quot;Who doesn&apos;t want to write a two-character play where people sit in chairs?&quot;  For the performers, this makes the challenge all the greater. &quot;Two actors in two chairs seems simple enough on paper,&quot; Gabriel Byrne said recently. &quot;But actually I would say that it&apos;s, if not the most complex show on television, one of the most complex. Because it&apos;s really difficult to get right.&quot; Of course, in real life even discussing one&apos;s patients, let alone allowing complete strangers to watch their therapy, is a professional no-no. Levinson acknowledges that &quot;a great deal of what makes this show interesting is the voyeurism aspect. You get to hear characters say things that you&apos;d never hear them say outside a therapist&apos;s office.&quot; Hagai Levi first went into therapy as a teenager. His family was very religious, and at 15 he was sent to a yeshiva in Jerusalem. A few years later, he started having panic attacks. While he was undergoing therapy, he studied for a BA in psychology, then went to film school. It was the combination of these experiences that eventually led him to create Be&apos;Tipul. In America, Levi tells me over the phone from Tel Aviv, people mention their therapist at the drop of a hat; in Israel, as in Britain, less so: &quot;One of my purposes in creating the series was to take out the stigma. It was very important to me to show that the patients are ordinary people.&quot; Before he came up with the idea, he worked on soap operas, of which Israel has a very established tradition. &quot;It was garbage, of course, as almost every soap is,&quot; he says. &quot;But I realised that this daily format has its power. You get into the calendar of these people.&quot; He aimed to find, he says, &quot;a more quiet, more sincere place in television: television is so much about manipulation and lies all the time. Almost every plot in television is based on the idea that one is cheating on the other: think about it. And in therapy there&apos;s no point in lying. Of course,&quot; he adds, &quot;you can lie to yourself, which makes it very interesting.&quot; The reaction was phenomenal: &quot;A lot of therapists thanked me, and said, &apos;Finally our families know what we are doing, what we have to deal with every day&apos;,&quot; Levi recalls. Psychological conventions were held around the series; professors used it in university courses; statistics showed that hordes of people went into therapy, or back into it. Hilariously, Israeli therapists increased their fees as a result. &quot;In the series,&quot; Levi explains, &quot;patients paid 400 shekels - approximately $100 - which is quite high in Israel, so automatically almost every therapist raised his rate!&quot; Though the two American seasons are based virtually exactly on the two Israeli seasons, Levi - who directed a couple of episodes in the second US series - found that there were some intriguing cultural adjustments to be made. He realised that the series was more Israeli than he thought: the patients were so direct they were &quot;almost violent&quot;, he says, &quot;which of course has a lot to do with the Israeli temperament. In Israel we don&apos;t have borders, unfortunately, so you cross them all the time in personal situations. We had to adapt these stories to American culture, which is of course more restrained, or polite.&quot; One of the narratives concerned a pilot who had dropped a bomb over Gaza and killed 13 children; it was based on a true story, and the political ramifications went far beyond the therapist&apos;s office. That storyline, Levi says, was &quot;deeply connected to the Israeli state of mind. One of our problems as a nation is that in our mind we are still survivors, and sometimes we think that we can do awful things to others because we are survivors.&quot; It became the most difficult to adapt; in the end, they had the pilot drop a bomb in Iraq, and made him African American, a man whose history and upbringing at least stood some chance of capturing the oppressed inflections of the original. Similarly, in the second series, there is a woman who is crushed by the fact that she is childless at 40. In Israel, the cultural pressure on women to have children is such that this was met with universal empathy; in America, no one involved in writing the script could see the problem. They had to make it much more about her love life, and cast her as the daughter of immigrants, who might share those old-fashioned values. As for the title of the series, that is not entirely translatable either. Be&apos;Tipul does mean &quot;in treatment&quot;, but in more casual conversation, the phrase means &quot;it&apos;s been taken care of&quot; or &quot;it&apos;s all under control&quot; - in answer, say, to whether a bill has been paid. So to Israeli audiences it always had an added tinge of irony, the ominously delusional sense of a fait accompli. The American series has been such a success that all the major TV buyers around the world have taken it up, with one prominent exception: Britain. (It will be screened at the Edinburgh Festival, though, this summer.) France, Portugal, eastern Europe, Sweden... Levi begins to reel off the countries that have bought it, and interrupts himself, mystified. &quot;What do you think? What&apos;s different about England? Maybe the British are too discreet for this.&quot; &quot;Too repressed,&quot; I suggest. &quot;Well,&quot; he sighs, &quot;that&apos;s another way to put it.&quot; Sigmund Freud made his first trip to America exactly a hundred years ago. As his boat docked on the Hudson, he looked at the waving crowds, turned to his fellow analyst Carl Gustav Jung and said: &quot;Don&apos;t they know we&apos;re bringing them the plague?&quot; Psychoanalysis certainly spread fast. By the time Freud died 30 years later, the centre of psychoanalysis was not Vienna or Berlin but New York. Over the ensuing years, it became transformed: diluted from its original form, popularised and subsumed within the prescription-filling medical establishment, something the lay analysts of the early 20th century had sought to avoid. In more recent years the profession has changed yet again. According to research conducted by the American Psychoanalytic Association, the number of patients in psychoanalysis has dropped at a rate of 1% every year since 1976. Few can afford New York analysts&apos; prices - they range from $100 to $500 a session - and even fewer are training to become analysts themselves. The average age of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute&apos;s membership is 75 (at an annual convention of psychoanalysts, I once heard the following proposition being floated over cocktails: &quot;So. You&apos;re in the Warsaw ghetto. Whaddaya do?&quot;) Most significantly, now people have many options other than orthodoxy - traditional psychoanalysis as descended from Freud has given way to the much broader, more varied and more practical set of treatments that come under the somewhat catch-all umbrella of psychotherapy.  &quot;Psychoanalysis has declined; psychotherapy hasn&apos;t,&quot; explains Dr George Makari, director of the New York Institute for the History of Psychiatry, and the author of a recent history of psychoanalysis. &quot;The idea that Freud was a fraud reached a peak during the 1980s; that energy has dissipated, and now there&apos;s something more pragmatic, something more like In Treatment, where the guy sees people once a week and they don&apos;t lie down on couches.&quot; In Treatment positions the Gabriel Byrne character as a member of the relational school of psychotherapy, a movement that, as Makari puts it, &quot;reframes intra-psychic problems as inter-psychic. It&apos;s not about one person - the objective, rational scientist - peering into the other and finding stuff, but two people involved in a tiny mini-culture, where certain problems emerge.&quot;  Hagai Levi conceived of it this way: &quot;People are used to seeing the therapist as a blank wall, but the therapist is a human being - and this is a very important part of the therapy. That&apos;s what makes it material for a TV series - it&apos;s about relationships.&quot; Considering the fact that Freud was such a magnificent storyteller, it&apos;s surprising that psychoanalysis, or psychotherapy, has lent itself relatively unfruitfully to film and TV. Just in the last couple of years various American series have made ham-fisted attempts (Huff, in which Hank Azaria played a therapist; Help Me Help You, a sitcom starring Ted Danson; Tell Me You Love Me, about a marriage guidance counsellor). There are the obvious movie classics - Hitchcock&apos;s Spellbound, the entire oeuvre of Woody Allen, Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in Analyze This. But these, as the psychoanalyst Bonnie Kaufman points out, use therapy as a dramatic premise, rather than attempting to offer a real representation of what happens behind closed doors. &quot;There&apos;s a long tradition,&quot; says Makari. &quot;The first people who wanted to make a film about psychoanalysis were part of the expressionist film scene in the 20s in Berlin. Freud said no - there&apos;s no way they&apos;re going to be able to depict this essentially verbal process, it&apos;s going to end up being - he didn&apos;t use the word &apos;kitsch&apos;, but I think that&apos;s what he meant. But his Berlin colleagues didn&apos;t agree and they went ahead and made a film.&quot; That became Secrets of a Soul, made in 1926 by GW Pabst (three years before he made Pandora&apos;s Box with Louise Brooks). It was co-written by two of Freud&apos;s disciples, Karl Abraham and Hanns Sachs. &quot;I think the central problem,&quot; Makari reflects, &quot;is that, if you ask any clinician, the excitement and the drama of a psychotherapeutic process is so internal that you could have a camera on people as very intense stuff is happening and it will show very little.&quot; But in relational psychotherapy, perhaps not. The most riveting dynamic in the first season of In Treatment is that between Byrne&apos;s Dr Weston and Laura, the woman crying on the sofa. We first see Laura toward the end of her first year of therapy. By the end of that session, she has confessed to Paul that she is in love with him. What starts out as her problem becomes his - he raises it in his own discussions with Gina, his former shrink, now resurrected from the woodwork to help him resolve such apparently theoretical crises as breaking up with one&apos;s wife and falling in love with one&apos;s patient. Gina, it turns out, has some history on this matter herself. In getting to the heart of one of psychotherapy&apos;s central complications - the patient&apos;s feelings for the therapist and the therapist&apos;s feelings for the patient, referred to as transference and counter-transference, respectively - the Paul/Laura narrative dramatises the fact that the doctor-patient relationship is central to every character&apos;s experience. They are all in some way twisted love stories, and this drives the series as a whole. Is Paul Weston a lover-figure, a father-figure, an antagonist, a priest, a prodigal son? And what possible damage can his own humanity cause? Steve Levinson hopes the show will provide more than mere entertainment. &quot;I do think it compels the viewers to examine their own lives more closely,&quot; he says. &quot;And who couldn&apos;t benefit from that?&quot; The first five episodes of In Treatment will be screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in June.

This year the famous image of the little boy in the Warsaw Ghetto raising his hands in surrender, one of the photos most associated with that terrible period, popped into my mind. We all have images we carry with us that have shaped our consciousness and outlook. I usually think back to the image of Jackie Robinson, my first childhood hero when I was growing up in Brooklyn, whose courage against all odds to break the colour barrier in American sports inspired me in my youth; the image of murdered Congolese African anti-colonial leader Patrice Lumumba, which I had hanging on my teenage wall; the image of dead and Israeli and Syrian soldiers during the Yom Kippur War when I spent eight months on the Golan Heights in a combat unit, which convinced me that peace was the primary need of our tortured region; and the image of Egyptian president Anwar El-Sadat, stepping out of the plane at Ben-Gurion Airport, after he travelled to the &quot;ends of the world&quot;, which convinced me that peace was possible. For some reason, I had repressed the Warsaw Ghetto boy image from that collection. I&apos;m not sure if this is fantasy or reality, but I seem to remember my father, who served in the American army during the second world war as a Jewish chaplain, saying to me as a young child: &quot;Look at that boy \u2013 he&apos;s the same age as you. And think of the difference of your circumstances and fate.&quot; I must have internalised that difference. I had the privilege of growing up in a war-free reality, the privilege of being able to try to take my fate in my own hands. That image must be one of the factors that led me to believe in the Jewish right to national self-determination and freedom, and the belief that all people should have the right to freedom and national self-determination. This year&apos;s Holocaust Day coincided with the opening of the Durban II Conference in Geneva, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s speech and the trading of insults between Iranian and Israeli leaders \u2013 Israelis are &quot;racists&quot;, Ahmadinejad &quot;equals Hitler&quot;. In the background lie fears of the Iranian nuclear option, and a possible &quot;nuclear Holocaust&quot; in the Middle East. Alongside the sirens, tears, memories and speeches, this year&apos;s Holocaust Day in Israel was also influenced by the screening of Killing Kastner, a groundbreaking two-hour documentary directed by Gaylen Ross about the murder in Tel Aviv of Yisrael Kastner by another Jew, Zeev Ekstein, in 1957. Kastner, a Hungarian Jew, was a &quot;Jewish Schindler&quot; who saved more Jews from the Nazis then any other Jew \u2013 1,685 on a train to freedom, and many of another 18,000 who were transferred to safety in a Nazi work camp. The problem was that he did this by negotiating with the Nazis, including Adolph Eichmann, a &quot;deal with the devil&quot; \u2013 Jews for trucks. In the eyes of Israeli rightwing circles, this made Kastner, who was a member of the establishment social democratic Mapai party, a &quot;Jewish quisling&quot;. And anyone who negotiates with the devil deserves to die. It&apos;s hard not to recall echoes of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by Jewish extremist Yigal Amir, who dared to negotiate and sign an agreement with &quot;the devil&quot;, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. In the early days of the state, and in many ways till this very day, there have been only two primary poles in Israeli consciousness. You either surrender, like the little boy in the Warsaw Ghetto photo, or you fight, if necessary to the death. There is no third way. Killing Kastner challenges these polar opposites. This is described most powerfully in the film by Israeli media personality Merav Michaeli, Kastner&apos;s granddaughter. She says that when she was growing up, the heroic images posed as the counterpoint to images of surrender were the heroic images of Chana Senesh, the kibbutz girl born in Hungary who parachuted behind the Nazi lines with two other colleagues and was caught and executed, and the heroic leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, led by Mordechai Anilewitz, who fought courageously against the Nazis before their death. &quot;But they didn&apos;t say even a single Jewish life,&quot; exclaims Michaeli, &quot;while my grandfather saved thousands of lives.&quot; The subtext of this discussion is very relevant today. Are the options to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat only military or surrender, or is President Barack Obama&apos;s diplomatic engagement the way to go? Is the only way to deal with Hamas rejectionism and the Qassam rockets surrender \u2013 we have no solution \u2013 or fight \u2013 we must boycott and overthrow Hamas \u2013 or is there a third way for Israel and the international community to constructively engage with Hamas to find a solution? We are still seeking the appropriate counterpoint to that photo of the little Jewish boy in the Warsaw Ghetto.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-23T11:00:00Z", "title": "Hillel Schenker: Holocaust Day: The images that shape us", "sentences": ["Alongside the sirens, tears, memories and speeches, this year&apos;s Holocaust Day in Israel was also influenced by the screening of Killing Kastner, a groundbreaking two-hour documentary directed by Gaylen Ross about the murder in Tel Aviv of Yisrael Kastner by another Jew, Zeev Ekstein, in 1957."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/23/holocaust-day-israel-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Israel", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Obama administration", "US politics", "US military"], "article": "Just over a month ago, President Barack Obama broke a 30-year embargo on US relations with Iran: he offered goodwill not only to &quot;Iranians&quot; but to the country&apos;s government. Speaking on the occasion of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, he said:  &quot;I want you, the people and leaders of Iran, to understand the future that we seek. It&apos;s a future with renewed exchanges among our people, and greater opportunities for partnership and commerce. It&apos;s a future where the old divisions are overcome, where you and all of your neighbours and the wider world can live in greater security and greater peace.&quot; It&apos;s no surprise that this message, given a generation of tension between Washington and Tehran, has been challenged in the US. What&apos;s more interesting is that the greatest threat to Obama&apos;s engagement comes not from media sceptics from Fox News to the Wall Street Journal or the foundations now packed with refugees from the Bush administration or even the Middle Eastern institutes putting a priority on Israeli security. No, Obama&apos;s most daunting opponents are within his own administration. Less than two weeks after the Nowruz address, General David Petraeus, the head of the US military command overseeing Iran and the Persian Gulf, offered a far different portrayal of Iran to a Senate committee:  Iranian activities and policies constitute the major state-based threat to regional stability. \u2026 Iran is assessed by many to be continuing its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, which would destabilise the region and likely spur a regional arms race.  The next day Petraeus&apos;s boss, Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, visited the offices of the Wall Street Journal, which has taken a consistent editorial line against dialogue with the Iranian government. Far from supporting his president, Mullen told the newspaper: &quot;I think we&apos;ve got a problem now. ... I think the Iranians are on a path to building nuclear weapons.&quot; Not even past enemies were as menacing: &quot;Even in the darkest days of the cold war we talked to the Soviets. \u2026 [But now] we don&apos;t have a lot of time.&quot; What&apos;s going on here? There are clear political goals behind Obama&apos;s approach of dialogue rather than confrontation. The hope is that Iran will not challenge the US approach to Middle Easten issues, in particular Israel-Palestine and Israel-Syria talks, through its connections with Hamas and Hezbollah. An easing of political tensions in turn may remove the motive for Tehran to reverse its suspension of research and development for a nuclear weapons \u2013 as opposed to civilian nuclear energy \u2013 programme. Yet there are also military benefits from a US-Iran rapprochement. As Obama&apos;s envoy Richard Holbrooke has made clear, a partnership with Tehran could ease the American burden in Afghanistan, especially as the troop surge is being implemented. Better relations could assist with the political transition in Iraq as the US draws down its overt military presence. Eventually, an Iranian renunciation of nuclear weapons would finally remove a significant strategic question mark in the region. In part, the calculation of Petraeus and Mullen is that Iran cannot be trusted in these areas. For years, US commanders in Iraq have alleged that Iran has been backing the insurgency, and Petraeus has also claimed that Tehran has supported the Taliban in Afghanistan. In his testimony to the Senate committee, the general expanded this into a grand nefarious Iranian scheme:  Iran employs surrogates and violent proxies to weaken competitor states, perpetuate conflict with Israel, gain regional influence and obstruct the Middle East peace process. Iran also uses some of these groups to train and equip militants in direct conflict with US forces. Syria, Iran&apos;s key ally, facilitates the Iranian regime&apos;s reach into the Levant and the Arab world by serving as the key link in an Iran-Syria-Hezbollah-Hamas alliance and allows extremists (albeit in smaller numbers than in the past) to operate in Damascus and to facilitate travel into Iraq.  Still, in their public opposition to Obama&apos;s Iran policy, the military commanders are playing one card before all others: Israel. Petraeus&apos;s threat to the congressmen was far from subtle: &quot;The Israeli government may ultimately see itself so threatened by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon that it would take pre-emptive military action to derail or delay it.&quot; Mullen told the Wall Street Journal: &quot;There is a leadership in Israel that is not going to tolerate&quot; a nuclear Iran. This was a &quot;life or death&quot; matter in which &quot;the operative word is &apos;existential&apos;&quot;.  Are they bluffing? If so, it&apos;s a bluff that has been coordinated with Tel Aviv. Last summer, Israel asked for but did not get George Bush&apos;s support for an airstrike on Iran. It took only six weeks for the Israelis to revive the topic with the new Obama administration: the commander of the Israeli armed forces, General Gabi Ashkenazi, visited Washington with the message &quot;that an Israeli military strike was a &apos;serious&apos; option&quot;. While Ashkenazi was told by Obama&apos;s political advisers to put his fighter planes away, the story of Israeli military plans continues to be circulated. Only last weekend, Sheera Frenkel was fed the story: &quot;The Israeli military is preparing itself to launch a massive aerial assault on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities within days of being given the go-ahead by its new government.&quot; High-level Obama officials are fighting back. Aware that a frontal assault on the popular Petraeus would be politically dangerous, they have tried to curb the &quot;Israel will strike&quot; campaign. Vice-president Joe Biden told CNN that new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &quot;would be ill-advised to do that&quot;. Perhaps more importantly, secretary of defence Robert Gates said last week that an Israeli attack would have &quot;dangerous consequences&quot;. Reading that signal, Israeli President Shimon Peres backed away from earlier tough talk and assured: &quot;All the talk about a possible attack by Israel on Iran is not true. The solution in Iran is not military.&quot; So, for this moment, Petraeus and Mullen appear to have been checked. However, they and their military allies, such as General Raymond Odierno in Iraq, have been persistent in challenging Obama over strategy from Kabul to Baghdad to Jerusalem. It is their manoeuvring, rather than Tehran&apos;s jailing of an Iranian-American journalist like Roxana Saberi or even Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s speeches at UN conferences, that is Barack Obama&apos;s greatest foe.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-23T13:30:00Z", "title": "Scott Lucas: The Obama administration's divided Iran policy", "sentences": ["If so, it&apos;s a bluff that has been coordinated with Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/apr/22/obama-petraeus-iran-israel"}, {"tags": ["Portsmouth", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "The Premier League&apos;s policing of its clubs&apos; ownership structures has been thrown back into the spotlight after an Israeli businessman claimed he has evidence that Ports\u00admouth belongs to Arkadi Gaydamak and not his son, Alexandre. The claim, made at a hearing in a Tel Aviv district court, was denied at Fratton Park. Lawyers for Joseph Traum, a former business partner of Gaydamak Sr, told the court in Israel that several of the assets said to belong to Gaydamak Jr are actually owned by his father. The lawyer Shahar Harary said: &quot;We have evidence that the whole Ports\u00admouth deal was done in Arkadi Gaydamak&apos;s home in Israel.&quot; In court Harary said that Gaydamak Sr constantly writes his assets under the names of his children or foreign companies for tax reasons and to avoid creditors. Gaydamak was not present at the hearing. Sacha (Alexandre) Gaydamak has consistently said that he owns Portsmouth and bought it with his own money, claims that have satisfied the Premier League.

The comics scene, ignored by serious lit lovers for decades, has stockpiled a vast amount of fiction, much of it aimed at adults. Suddenly, that material seems to have reached critical mass, and even the snootiest readers have realised they&apos;ve been missing something.  In this climate, reviewing new graphic work is both easier and more difficult. It&apos;s no longer necessary to convince people that comics can be more than Batman or the Beano. On the other hand, anything with any merit tends to get overpraised and is routinely spared the sort of critical scrutiny brought to bear on everything else, from a new Zadie Smith novel to the latest Star Wars flick. The mainstream press almost never measures a graphic novel&apos;s actual achievement against its unfulfilled potential. New converts, reluctant to show their cluelessness about the ninth art, merely parrot the publishers&apos; hype. Rutu Modan&apos;s Exit Wounds, published in 2007, is an emotional whodunit set in modern Israel, in which a taxi driver and a female ex-soldier try to discover the identity of a man killed in a bomb attack. It&apos;s a well-constructed tale, told with understatement and quiet insight - the graphic equivalent of a decent literary novel. I liked it but was uneasy about the extravagant accolades it garnered. Now, emboldened by those accolades, Jonathan Cape is issuing Modan&apos;s earlier work, a selection of shorter pieces that originally appeared in various anthologies as far back as 1998. The author&apos;s afterword, and interviews she&apos;s given elsewhere, make it clear that she regards these stories as steps towards artistic maturity, a gradual progression that ended in Exit Wounds. If that book was no masterpiece, does this mean that Jamilti and Other Stories is a ragbag of juvenilia?  Not at all. In my view, Jamilti is the more interesting book, and it raises important questions about current notions - held by both consumers and creators - of how comics for grownups ideally ought to function. The younger Modan is rougher at the edges, quirkier, more self-consciously arty. Apart from the most recent piece, &quot;Your Number One Fan&quot;, there&apos;s nothing here that could easily be made into a movie. &quot;The Panty Killer&quot;, a madcap thriller about a rash of underwear-enhanced murders in Tel Aviv, is wickedly witty, but the wit is in the artwork and its playful juxtapositions. Without the cinematic pacing that makes Exit Wounds a quick read, almost every panel invites a long, leisurely look. The fantastically dowdy dresses of the women and the blowsy wallpaper of their homes are riots of intricate design and colour.  The oldest of the pieces is &quot;King of the Lillies&quot;, one of the first comics published by Actus Tragicus, the Israeli artists&apos; collective of which Modan was a founder member. In this elegantly bizarre fable (set in a fantasised pre-war Sweden) the Lillies are a Sapphic troupe of women, surgically altered by a plastic surgeon in the image of his long-lost beloved. The influence of Edward Gorey is unmistakable, not just in the archaic style but also in the characters&apos; eerie dignity in the face of grotesque calamity.  In time, Modan came to recognise that grotesque calamities - and the dark humour of denial - were in plentiful supply in her country. Her subsequent stories address Israel&apos;s mingled complacency and fear as the war with the Palestinians drags on. In the resonantly powerful title story, a nurse&apos;s chance meeting with a suicide bomber casts a shadow of ambivalence over her imminent marriage to her macho boyfriend. In &quot;Homecoming&quot;, a senile father continues to believe that his son, shot down over Lebanon, will return. Then a plane starts to circle the kibbutz, and the family gather on the beach where the father has scrawled &quot;welcome home&quot; in the sand. Told in 30 full-page panels, &quot;Homecoming&quot; feels like a children&apos;s book that maintains a spirit of innocence in a terrifying world.  In &quot;Bygone&quot;, Modan attempts to exorcise her own grief at losing both parents when young, through a queasily erotic fantasy about orphaned sisters running a spooky hotel. Drawn in monochrome, with up to nine panels per page to increase the sense of emotional claustrophobia, &quot;Bygone&quot; could have been an eye-straining mess, but Modan&apos;s highly developed skills in composition, and her gift for capturing psychological nuances with a few lines, make this not just readable, but involving and fun. The lost-parent theme turns up again in &quot;Energy Blockage&quot;, a sad farce played out in the tacky world of quack medicine scams.  &quot;Your Number One Fan&quot;, composed after the author&apos;s recent relocation from Tel Aviv to Sheffield, is a low-key, wry vignette about a wannabe rock star performing at a Jewish buffet in that city. Like Exit Wounds, it&apos;s drawn in a style Modan describes as &quot;more realistic, more clean&quot;, reminiscent of Herg\u00e9&apos;s ligne claire; indeed, it has a somewhat Tintin-esque look. And, without the detective elements that enlivened the slowburn romance of Exit Wounds, this tale of mediocre misfits stays just on the right side of humdrum. &quot;When I was young,&quot; Modan has said, &quot;I wanted my work to be unique, so I made it surreal and grotesque. Now I find myself mostly doing the opposite: I make things more subtle than what really happened. I&apos;m really not interested in exaggerating life any more.&quot; This mistrust of anything mystical or expressionist, and the aspiration to make one&apos;s drawing style ever more transparent and matter of fact, applies not just to Modan but to many other well-regarded comics creators of recent years, such as Chris Ware, Adrian Tomine, Alison Bechdel, Dan Clowes, Seth and others. Their cool objectivity and droll observation promote an almost documentary aesthetic. While this can yield impressive results, I can&apos;t help thinking that it represents a retreat from the limitless potential of handcrafted visual art. In her &quot;mature&quot; work, Modan produces indie movies on the page, just waiting to be discovered by Hollywood. In her earlier pieces, her art is bolder, stranger, more surprising. I hope that Jamilti enjoys enough success for Modan to reconnect with techniques she&apos;s supposedly outgrown, and be inspired to display the full depth and range of her extraordinary talent. \u2022 Michel Faber&apos;s The Fire Gospel is published by Canongate", "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "Review: Jamilti and Other Stories by Rutu Modan", "sentences": ["&quot;The Panty Killer&quot;, a madcap thriller about a rash of underwear-enhanced murders in Tel Aviv, is wickedly witty, but the wit is in the artwork and its playful juxtapositions.", "&quot;Your Number One Fan&quot;, composed after the author&apos;s recent relocation from Tel Aviv to Sheffield, is a low-key, wry vignette about a wannabe rock star performing at a Jewish buffet in that city."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/25/rutu-modan-jamilti"}, {"tags": ["Politics", "Israel", "World news", "Culture", "Books"], "article": "It is a popular misconception that the terms &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;Arab&quot; are mutually exclusive. They represent the two clashing forces in the Middle East, entangled in a deadly embrace which has wide-ranging implications for world politics. However, the fact is that about half the Jewish people in the world, and half the Jewish people in Israel, can arguably be described as Arabs, or as people of Arab descent. These are the Jews who came from the Jewish communities in the Arab world and were, by and large, forced to leave their countries by the turmoil of the 20th century.  British Jews, most of whom are of eastern European origin, are often surprised when they visit Israel, encountering a society which seems less familiar than expected. This was not the case with Rachel Shabi. The Israel-born, London-raised journalist, whose parents emigrated from Iraq to Israel and then to the UK, seems particularly qualified to write the history of this group, which has thus far been mostly ignored, especially by western writers.  The Zionist movement is an offspring of its day and age. It was born in the context of European national liberation movements, and drew encouragement and legitimacy from European colonialism. It accumulated power and attracted popular participation against a background of European antisemitism. Its founders mostly overlooked the Jewish communities of the Middle East, who lived in relative peace among their Muslim neighbours. Two catastrophes led the Zionists to focus their attention on those communities in the middle of the 20th century. The Holocaust exhausted Europe as a likely source for significant immigration to newly born Israel. The Nakba - the driving out of Arab Palestinians from Palestine by the Zionist movement - ensured the state lost almost all its working class. In the search for more Jewish inhabitants, and for working hands, the eyes of the Zionist leaders finally wandered east.  What they saw there did not impress them much. David Ben Gurion, father of the nation, described the Jewish communities in Arab countries as being &quot;without a trace of Jewish or human education&quot;. Zionist envoy Enzo Sereny, who was sent to Baghdad, however, kindly assessed that &quot;they could be turned into human beings&quot;. Thus, half the Jewish people - Baghdadi doctors and Kurdish farmers, Casablanca scholars and Algerian communists, Syrian gold merchants and Egyptian students - were branded as dubious &quot;human material&quot; which could be made useful if kicked into shape by the diligent Ashkenazi (Europe-born) leadership in Palestine, and later in Israel.  Importing the Mizrachi (&quot;eastern&quot;) Jews to Israel has been made relatively easy by the tensions created between them and their homelands due to the circumstances of the creation of Israel. The mistreatment of the Palestinian Arabs by Israel engendered a guilt by association on Jews everywhere. The Zionists, for their part, promoted the idea that &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;Zionist&quot; are synonymous. In places where the hostility against Jews was not sufficient to get them to emigrate, Zionist agents sometimes helped encourage such sentiments. Upon arriving in Israel, Mizrachi immigrants were shoved into &quot;transition camps&quot;, and later sent to development towns on the frontiers. They were stripped of their language, their culture was mocked, and huge efforts were made to push them into the melting pot of Israeli society, designed not only to unite all Israeli Jews, but also to make them conform into a &quot;westernised&quot; mass.  Shabi takes us through the history of Mizrachi Jews, from the early days of Zionism to the contemporary development town of Sderot, where the working-class Mizrachi inhabitants still feel that their predicament - the rockets fired at them from Gaza - would be taken more seriously were they Jews of Polish origin living near Tel Aviv. Her work is thoroughly researched, carefully analytical and highly readable. She uses her own family story well without placing herself at the centre of her account. Her analysis is particularly sharp when it comes to the complex connections between Zionist ideology, the treatment of Palestinians by Israel, and the &quot;place in between&quot; - not quite first-class Jews, but not second-class Arabs either - imposed on Mizrachi Jews. If one wanted to nitpick, Shabi&apos;s research into the early days of the Zionist immigration to Palestine and into Israel itself, and her account of the last 10 years, are stronger than her command of the main events of the 1970s and 80s, the years that led to the most significant changes in the status of Mizrachi Jews in Israel. She also overlooks the fact that one of her interviewees, presenter and journalist Yaron London, who speaks candidly of anti-Mizrachi bias in the Israeli media, was himself involved in one of the most scandalous incidents in this regard in the 1980s. London mocked his interviewee, popular Mizrachi singer Nissim Sarussi, in a television interview which has since become one of the most iconic examples of the scorn of the Ashkenazi establishment towards Mizrachi culture. That said, these are minor shortcomings in what is a fascinating book. \u2022 Daphna Baram is the author of Disenchantment: The Guardian and Israel (Guardian Books)", "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "Review: Not the Enemy by Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["Shabi takes us through the history of Mizrachi Jews, from the early days of Zionism to the contemporary development town of Sderot, where the working-class Mizrachi inhabitants still feel that their predicament - the rockets fired at them from Gaza - would be taken more seriously were they Jews of Polish origin living near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/25/arab-jews-israel-rachel-shabi"}, {"tags": ["Drugs policy", "Drugs", "Police", "Law", "Politics", "Society", "UK news", "US domestic policy", "World news", "US politics", "Mephedrone", "Legal highs"], "article": "Earlier this month Kenneth Rau, 47, made history, for all the wrong reasons. He is thought to have become the first person in America to be charged with possessing salvia divinorum, a little-known drug derived from the mint plant that was originally used by Mexican shamans to alter their states of consciousness.  When chewed or smoked, the drug is said to have hallucinogenic properties, with &quot;highs&quot; lasting anything from one to five minutes. Users report that the apparently non-addictive drug can promote uncontrollable laughter and evoke childhood memories. After-effects also include an increased feeling of insight, an improved mood, calmness and an enhanced connection with nature. Not all users agree that salvia is an pleasurable experience, however. &quot;I like taking drugs to enjoy myself, but that wasn&apos;t fun,&quot; said Jo Puddle, a London student who tried salvia once. &quot;I thought all my arms and legs had turned into tubes. I really wouldn&apos;t recommend it to anyone.&quot; Rau, from Bismarck, Dakota, who bought the drug on eBay and received a deferred sentence, can count himself unlucky. Few countries have outlawed salvia and indeed only a handful of US states have made possession of the drug a criminal offence. That those states chose to criminalise the drug was largely in response to a growing media clamour. There are concerns among a powerful network of US broadcasters that what the Aztecs started the YouTube generation is now appropriating for a more sinister intent. Exploiting the drug&apos;s legality, videos promoting salvia - also known as &quot;Sage of the Seers&quot; - have appeared on the web, spawning its own glamorous subculture. An entry on an online pro-drugs forum, where Rau has become an unlikely hero, appears typical of users&apos; experiences. &quot;About 10 seconds later, I feel everything start to rush and it came so intense I just started laughing hysterically and stood up,&quot; the user said. &quot;Then I started to feel like something was pulling on me and next thing I know I&apos;m thinking cartoon characters were coming away to take me to their cartoon land. Then I was in the cartoon land. The high was short but it was so intense and I&apos;ve never tried anything else besides pot and liquor.&quot; The backlash against salvia is growing. Media interest in the US has been heightened after the mother of Brett Chidester, a 17-year-old Delaware student, blamed the drug for the suicide of her son. In his diary, Chidester noted: &quot;Salvia allows us to give up our senses and wander in the interdimensional time and space. Also, and this is probably hard for most to accept, our existence in general is pointless. We earthly humans are nothing.&quot; Kathleen Chidester is now leading a national crusade against the drug. &quot;My hope and goal is to have salvia regulated across the US,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s my son&apos;s legacy and I will not end my fight until this happens.&quot; The US is not alone in its concerns. Just as the panic over crystal meth went from the US to the UK, so concerns about salvia are now lapping this country&apos;s shores - part of a wider anxiety about the increasing visibility of &quot;legal highs&quot;, a catch-all phrase for a bewildering panoply of drugs that help people get out of their minds while staying within the law. Indeed its legality is one of salvia&apos;s USPs. &quot;I know a few people who do this and they always go back for more,&quot; said Danny Smith, a railway worker from London who takes salvia occasionally. &quot;I don&apos;t take illegal drugs because of my job, so I take these instead. I smoked some the other day. I felt like I was being pushed down into the ground, like I was floating, at the same time. It&apos;s not something you could do every day, but it&apos;s fun at the weekend.&quot; John Mann, a Labour MP, claims the drug is &quot;very harmful&quot;. In 2005, he sponsored an early day motion calling for it to be banned and nothing that has happened since has made him change his mind.  In a recent letter to the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, Mann writes: &quot;Sadly the issue has come to light again as our young people are using the internet and sites like YouTube to broadcast their friends taking the drug and witnessing the hallucinogenic effects. Our young people are at risk and a wider cultural attachment to this drug seems to be developing that I am sure you agree - regardless of its legal status - needs nipping in the bud.&quot;  Last week, Mann&apos;s request was partially answered. A Home Office minister, Phil Woolas, confirmed to parliament that the market in &quot;legal highs&quot; was now an issue for the government. When asked by an Ulster Unionist MP, Lady Hermon, whether the government intended to classify salvia as an illegal drug, Woolas said the home secretary had written to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the independent body that advises government on drugs, asking it to investigate. Woolas said the council had been asked to &quot;provide advice to government on the availability and harms of psychoactive legal alternatives to illegal drugs, so-called &apos;legal highs&apos;, with a particular focus on protecting young people. I fully anticipate that this work will include salvia divinorum. The government&apos;s position on its control will be informed by advisory council&apos;s advice.&quot; Both Smith and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) are concerned about the sale of legal highs through &quot;head shops&quot; - retailers who sell drug paraphernalia such as bongs and rolling equipment. Close interest in the activities of the shops, which have spread rapidly across Britain, was sparked by the advisory council&apos;s recent work around cannabis reclassification. The council observed how cannabis seeds were widely sold through the shops and their online counterparts, allowing users to grow their own drugs.  Currently the sale of cannabis seeds is legal because they can be used for non-criminal ventures - chiefly the production of the material, hemp. But the police fear the head shops are exploiting legal loopholes. As a result, last month Acpo published new guidance on head shops for the police. It advocated officers make test purchases as &quot;an effective way of gathering evidence of the true nature of a business&quot;. It recommended that &quot;covert observations of premises may be considered appropriate in order to establish patterns of behaviour and the movement of vehicles&quot;. The move has been interpreted in some quarters as a declaration of war on head shops, one that could have damaging consequences for the &quot;legal highs&quot; market. Unsurprisingly, head shops have been quick to launch their defence. &quot;These drugs aren&apos;t like magic mushrooms,&quot; said Ahmed Noar, sales assistant at a head shop on Camden High Street, north London. &quot;Magic mushrooms were made illegal because they were dangerous. These highs are perfectly safe. If they were made illegal it would damage our business - we rely on legal highs for about 20% of our income.&quot; Paradoxically, because many of the drugs are legal they have escaped scrutiny - which means little is known about their side-effects or the size of their market. Given this lacuna, misinformation is rife. &quot;The problem is people often hear about them by word of mouth,&quot; said Martin Barnes, chief executive of Drugscope, an organisation that collects street data on the drugs scene. &quot;The highs are often exaggerated and the harm understated. They are technically legal. Does that mean they are safe? No, it does not.&quot; Indeed, close analysis often reveals many of the many apparently legal drugs contain illegal and dangerous substances. One of the most popular is spice, which comes in varieties such as spice gold, spice arctic synergy and spice yukatan fire.  The drug, usually rolled into cigarettes and smoked like cannabis, was recently made illegal in Austria and Germany after some varieties were shown to contain a synthetic material, JWH-018, that is four times stronger than THC, the natural psychoactive substance in cannabis. &quot;It has been confirmed that the fashion-drug spice is indeed not the harmless herbal mixture its manufacturers say it is,&quot; said Sabine Baetzing of Germany&apos;s Social Democrats party when the ban was announced earlier this year. &quot;Tests have shown that smoking the drug can cause undesirable side affects on the heart, circulation and nervous system, in some cases leading to unconsciousness. There is also a danger of addiction.&quot; The reverse also applies. Some head shops are advertising a &quot;legal&quot; form of BZP, a compound drug similar to ecstasy also known as &quot;Benny&quot; and &quot;Frenzy&quot; - which is available in the UK only on prescription and is banned in many other countries. Tests show, however, that much of the &quot;legal&quot; BZP sold in the UK bears little chemical resemblance to the restricted drug.  The truth is that - as with illegal drugs - buyers don&apos;t know what they are getting unless it is tested. And manufacturers of legal highs are adept at churning out new varieties at an impressive rate. A new drug called mephedrone, for example, sells for around \u00a314 a gram and has many of the effects of amphetamine and cocaine. Chemically, the compound is extremely similar to crystal meth, but its legal status is ambiguous, banned in some countries but not in others given its relatively recent appearance and its low profile.  Drugscope&apos;s magazine, Druglink, reports that drugs similar to mephedrone first appeared in Israel around 2004, under the name &quot;hagigat&quot; and were outlawed following several hospitalisations in Tel Aviv. But its producers modified hagigat&apos;s chemical structure and started selling the new drugs under the name &quot;neorganics&quot;.  The advisory council&apos;s working group has pledged to outline its initial findings on the legal highs market at an open meeting next month. The task promises to be a mammoth one, according to Barnes.  &quot;Drugs policy should be based on evidence,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;Where there is clear evidence a drug is harmful it should be made illegal, but I suspect the working group will have difficulty in gathering evidence both of the prevalence [of legal highs] and of establishing how harmful they are.&quot; Many believe the government would be wasting its time attempting to tackle the legal highs market, given its limited success in tackling the sale of illegal drugs. &quot;Cannabis is completely fine, salvia and spice are perfectly safe too if you&apos;re healthy,&quot; said Danny Mango, manager of Shoprite Market, another head shop in Camden High Street. &quot;What the government says is all propaganda.&quot; But the manager of a head shop a few yards further down the street suggested there was at least a case to be made against salvia. &quot;I think it&apos;s really dangerous and I&apos;d never try it myself,&quot; he said.  &quot;If I caught my kids smoking it, I&apos;d give them a smack round the head. If you try it once, fine. But if you smoke it for five, 10 years, you&apos;ll have big problems. It&apos;ll change who you are. If I ever see parents come in here with their teenagers, I have a quiet word with them and say, &apos;You should not be letting them near this stuff&apos;.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-04-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "There are many drugs that help people get out of their minds yet stay within the law - they're called 'legal highs'", "sentences": ["Drugscope&apos;s magazine, Druglink, reports that drugs similar to mephedrone first appeared in Israel around 2004, under the name &quot;hagigat&quot; and were outlawed following several hospitalisations in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/26/drugs-legal-substances-highs"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "It began calmly enough with a march down the high street after midday prayers at the mosque. Palestinian villagers were surrounded by dozens of foreigners singing and waving flags. They turned and headed out to the olive-tree fields and up towards the broad path of Israel&apos;s West Bank barrier. There, behind a concrete hilltop bunker, the Israeli soldiers looked down on them. The crowd approached the barrier, still singing. One man flew a paper kite shaped as a plane. &quot;This land is a closed military zone,&quot; an Israeli soldier shouted in flawless Arabic over a loudspeaker. &quot;You are not allowed near the wall.&quot; Then the soldiers fired a barrage of teargas. It has been like this every Friday in the village of Bil&apos;in for more than four years \u2013 the most persistent popular demonstration against Israel&apos;s vast steel and concrete barrier. It is a protest founded on non-violence that is spreading to other West Bank villages. But it has become increasingly dangerous. On April 17, on the hillside at Bil&apos;in, a Palestinian named Basem Abu Rahmeh, 31, was shot with a high-velocity Israeli teargas canister that sliced a hole into his chest, caused massive internal bleeding and quickly killed him. Video footage shot by another demonstrator shows he was unarmed, many metres from the barrier and posing no threat to the soldiers. The Israeli military said it faced a &quot;violent and illegal riot&quot; and is investigating. On Friday the demonstrators at Bil&apos;in wore Rameh&apos;s image on T-shirts and carried it on posters. Last month another demonstrator, an American named Tristan Anderson, 38, was hit in the head by an identical high-velocity teargas canister in a protest against the barrier at the nearby village of Na&apos;alin. He was severely injured, losing the sight in his right eye and suffering brain damage. &quot;To shoot peaceful demonstrators is really horrifying to us,&quot; said his mother, Nancy. Friday&apos;s demonstration lasted around three hours. The crowd repeatedly surged towards the fence, then retreated under clouds of teargas. The military sounded a constant, high-pitched siren, interspersed with warnings in Arabic and Hebrew: &quot;Go back. You with the flag, go back&quot; and, incongruously, in English: &quot;You are entering a naval vessel exclusion zone. Reverse course immediately.&quot; The Bil&apos;in demonstration was always intended to be non-violent, although on Friday, as is often the case, there were half a dozen younger, angrier men lobbing stones at the soldiers with slingshots. The Israeli military, for its part, fires teargas, stun grenades, rubber-coated bullets and sometimes live ammunition at the crowd. There have long been Palestinian advocates of non-violence, but they were drowned out by the militancy of the second intifada, the uprising that began in late 2000 and erupted into waves of appalling suicide bombings. Eyad Burnat, 36, has spent long hours in discussions with the young men of Bil&apos;in, a small village of fewer than 2,000, convincing them of the merits of &quot;civil grassroots resistance&quot;. &quot;Of course it gets more difficult when someone is killed,&quot; said Burnat, who heads the demonstration. &quot;But we&apos;ve faced these problems in the past. We&apos;ve had more than 60 people arrested and still they go back to non-violence. We&apos;ve made a strategic decision.&quot; Some, like the moderate Palestinian MP Mustafa Barghouti, hope this might be the start of a broader movement throughout Palestinian society. &quot;It is a spark that is spreading,&quot; he said in Bil&apos;in. &quot;It gives an alternative to the useless negotiations and to those who say only violence can help.&quot; But it is not so much that all the young men of the village are converted to the peaceful cause, rather that they respect and follow their elders. &quot;I personally don&apos;t believe in non-violent resistance,&quot; said Nayef al-Khatib, 21, an accountancy student. &quot;They&apos;ve taken our land by force so we should take it back from them by force.&quot; The barrier at Bil&apos;in cuts off the village from more than half its agricultural land and has allowed the continuing expansion of Jewish settlements, including the vast, ultra-Orthodox settlement of Modiin Illit, even though all settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law. The international court of justice said in a 2004 advisory opinion that the barrier was illegal where it crossed into the West Bank, and even Israel&apos;s supreme court ruled nearly two years ago that the route at Bil&apos;in did not conform to any &quot;security-military reasons&quot; and must be changed. But it has not been moved. Like most of the men in the village, Nayef al-Khatib has spent time in jail. He was arrested aged 17 for demonstrating and spent a year behind bars, taking his final year of high school from his prison cell. That jail term means he cannot now obtain a permit to travel to Jerusalem or across to Jordan and is often held for hours at Israeli military checkpoints inside the West Bank. &quot;But it was an honour for me. Now I&apos;m like the older men,&quot; he said. Some of those older men are influential. Ahmad al-Khatib, 32, was once a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs&apos; Brigade, a prominent militant group, and was jailed for a year for transporting weapons. Now he is committed to non-violence, even objecting to the stone throwers. &quot;I don&apos;t apologise for what I did, but I&apos;m not going back to it,&quot; he said. &quot;We are an occupied nation according to international law and we have the right to resist, though that doesn&apos;t mean I support suicide bombers. But I don&apos;t want to resist all my life.&quot; He argues that a non-violent strategy brings fewer Palestinian casualties. &quot;I have no problem dying to get back my land, but I&apos;d say to hell with my land if it just brought back our martyr who died last week. The life of a human being is more important than the land itself.&quot; Often the most sensitive issue for the villagers has not been whether to take up arms, but whether to accept in their midst so many foreigners, and in particular so many Israeli demonstrators. Ahmad al-Khatib said it was the &quot;most disputed question&quot; and that many feared the Israelis were spying on them until they saw they, too, were being injured and arrested. One of the first Israelis to join the Bil&apos;in protest in its earliest days was Jonathan Pollack, 27, an activist and member of Anarchists Against the Wall who lives in Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv. Although they warmly welcome him now, it was tense at first. &quot;I&apos;m still not one of their own and I don&apos;t pretend to be,&quot; he said. Unlike most other joint peace initiatives, in this case the Israelis are in the minority and in the background. &quot;I think it is very important that the struggle is Palestinian-led and that the colonial power relations are knowingly reversed,&quot; said Pollack.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-27T11:44:10Z", "title": "Non-violent protests against West Bank security barrier turn increasingly dangerous", "sentences": ["One of the first Israelis to join the Bil&apos;in protest in its earliest days was Jonathan Pollack, 27, an activist and member of Anarchists Against the Wall who lives in Jaffa, just south of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/27/israel-security-barrier-protests"}, {"tags": ["Germany", "Musicals", "Stage", "Culture", "World news", "Theatre", "Adolf Hitler", "Europe"], "article": "The main actors have been given Bavarian accents and, on huge red banners, pretzels take the place of swastikas as Berlin braces itself for its first theatre production of the Mel Brooks musical The Producers. The show, due to open in mid-May, has prompted questions as to whether a German audience is ready to see stormtroopers dancing in swastika formation, a brownshirt ballet and a hip-swinging Hitler crooning a song called Heil Myself. Considered the most successful Broadway musical of all time, the show tells the story of two New York Jewish chancers who, for accountancy purposes, put the tasteless musical Springtime for Hitler together in the hope it will be a flop. It turns out to be a huge hit. The Producers&apos; producers say they are convinced that modern German audiences are ready for lyrics such as &quot;Raise your beer! Every hotsy-totsy Nazi come and cheer!&quot; and &quot;Hitched up my pants and conquered France!

Of course as a German-speaker you first feel a little bit uneasy about what you&apos;re seeing. But if you let yourself go, you can have a great deal of fun, because it&apos;s so wonderfully satirised.&quot; While posters of a knock-kneed Hitler have been plastered around the city, the pretzel on the banners outside the theatre was necessary because it is forbidden to display the Nazi symbol in public. Mel Brooks, now 82, who won 12 Tony awards for the musical in 2001, and an Oscar for best original film script in 1968, told Berlin listings magazine Tip that he was shying away from the German premiere, as he had from others in Tel Aviv and Vienna. &quot;I&apos;d prefer not to go, not least because I would have to fear facing some mentally disturbed sharpshooter who wants to have it out with me for stripping the fuhrer of his honour,&quot; he said. But he added he was intrigued to see &quot;how Berliners will receive my treatment of Hitler and I ask myself how they&apos;ll react to all the swastikas&quot;.

As Britain advised holidaymakers not to travel to Mexico, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said the world was now at a &quot;turning period&quot; where it would become clear whether the virus was capable of sustained movement between humans on a large scale, bringing the likelihood of a pandemic a step closer. So far community transmission had been seen in Mexico and the US, he said. Hartl said it was not clear whether the British couple confirmed to have the virus, Iain and Dawn Askham, had both been infected in Mexico or whether one had infected the other. Some flights to Mexico from the UK were cancelled this morning and arrangements were being put in place to bring British holidaymakers home after the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the country. All Thomson and First Choice flights to Mexico from Manchester this week have been grounded until restrictions are lifted. The 11 cases in New Zealand, among students and teachers from a single school who reported fevers and other flu symptoms upon return from a visit to Mexico, are the first in the Asia-Pacific region. A 26-year-old patient in Netanya, a coastal city north of Tel Aviv in Israel, was infected but was said to have recovered fully. Passengers due to fly to Mexico with Thomson this morning said they had been offered their money back or an alternative holiday. The company said it was making arrangements to get customers home from Mexico, with repatriation flights starting today. The Foreign Office advised British citizens living in Mexico to &quot;consider whether they should remain&quot;. The Mexican government has closed schools across the country. Spain confirmed a second case of a patient with swine flu today and South Korea said a woman there had tested positive for swine flu, making her a &quot;probable&quot; case. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, who will join a meeting of the government&apos;s Cobra emergency committee chaired by health secretary Alan Johnson today, said he would take &quot;all urgent action necessary&quot; to try to halt the virus. Brown said he understood the &quot;very real concern&quot; of Britons but added that the UK was among the best prepared countries in the world. Last night, the WHO&apos;s emergency committee raised the pandemic threat level to phase four out of a possible six, after the death toll in Mexico rose to 152, with nearly 2,000 people believed to be infected, the number of cases in the US doubled and the first infections were confirmed in Britain. Phase four means that the crisis had taken a significant step towards pandemic, but does not mean one was inevitable. Nonetheless, the WHO said, the virus had spread so far that containment was &quot;not a feasible operation&quot; and the international response should be to try to limit its transmission and treat those affected. The Scottish couple suffering from swine flu, from Polmont, near Falkirk had been in Mexico on honeymoon in Canc\u00fan. About 22 friends, family and colleagues who had close contact with them were being observed and had been given antiviral drugs. Seven of these were showing &quot;mild symptoms&quot; of the illness. The group being monitored reportedly includes a five-year-old child. Last night, the Scottish health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said the couple were recovering well at Monklands hospital in Airdrie, Lanarkshire. Medics at Manchester airport treated a passenger arriving from Mexico this morning who had complained of feeling unwell on the flight, the Health Protection Agency said. She has been sent home and has been tested for swine flu. The first confirmed case in Europe came yesterday in Spain, where 26 other cases are suspected. There are four suspected cases in the Irish Republic. In an indication of the seriousness with which the threat is being taken in the UK, the Guardian has learned that if the situation deteriorates, Johnson is considering warning the entire population to set up a support network of friends and relatives, so they can be quickly quarantined at home if they are thought to have symptoms. The friends would then collect medicine on their behalf. He abandoned plans to give this advice as one of his four key messages yesterday in a Commons statement. He told MPs it was too early to say if there was a pandemic, but the UK had been preparing for one for five years and had a stock of 33m anti-flu drugs. He said it was important to note that outside Mexico all those who had shown symptoms of swine flu had recovered. Mexico&apos;s health secretary, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel C\u00f3rdova, said he expected more people to die. Nearly 2,000 people had been treated in hospital for suspected infection, he said. Half of them had been released. C\u00f3rdova admitted that the health authorities lacked the staff to check on all suspected cases. Some foreign health officials fear such difficulties may be contributing to the disease&apos;s spread. In New York, the number of confirmed cases among students at a school rose to 28, with more than 100 suspected. That brought the number of confirmed cases in the US to 42 in five states, twice as many as reported at the weekend. Peru and Guatemala reported the first suspected infections in other parts of Latin America, where health officials fear swine flu has already spread but so far gone undetected. Gauging the spread: WHO viral infection phases Phase one: No animal viruses circulating are causing infections in humans. Phase two: An animal flu virus is known to have caused human infection and is considered a potential pandemic threat. Phase three: Limited human-to-human transmission may occur. This does not indicate the virus has gained transmissibility that would cause a pandemic. Phase four: Human-to-human transmission able to cause &quot;community-level outbreaks&quot;. Significant increase in pandemic risk but it is not a foregone conclusion. Phase five: Human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. A strong signal that pandemic is imminent. Phase six: Pandemic phase, characterised by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region along with phase five.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-28T10:57:00Z", "title": "Swine flu can no longer be contained, WHO warns", "sentences": ["A 26-year-old patient in Netanya, a coastal city north of Tel Aviv in Israel, was infected but was said to have recovered fully."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/28/swine-flu-mexico1"}, {"tags": ["Swine flu", "Australia news", "Ireland", "New Zealand", "Israel", "Spain", "World news", "Health", "Society", "Travel", "Flu", "Life and style", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Australia Authorities have imposed tough border-control measures, warning of a likely swine flu outbreak with 45 people being tested for the deadly virus. Emergency response teams and hotlines have been set up across the country and Tasmania, an island state in the south, has threatened to shut its borders in an attempt to keep the flu out. Airlines servicing Australia from the Americas are required to report any passengers with flu-like symptoms before being cleared to land at local airports. Nurses have been stationed at international airports to detect and treat anyone suspected of carrying the virus. The rapid spread across the world has forced Australian authorities to track down people who shared the Air New Zealand flight that carried an Auckland school group returning from an excursion to Mexico who have tested positive for the illness. Suspected patients have been isolated at home and given the Tamiflu and Relenza vaccines which the federal government stockpiled in the wake of the Sars outbreak in 2002. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, says all available resources will be marshalled to fight the &quot;evolving threat. This is a serious international concern for public health,&quot; he said. With almost 9m doses of medication at hand, Australia has one of the biggest per-capita vaccine reserves in the world. Yet many fear it may not be enough. Pharmacists say a growing number of people have been asking for the vaccine and purchasing surgical masks. Airline shares have tumbled amid fears that tourism would again be hit as it was during the Sars outbreak while pharmaceutical stocks have surged on the rising death toll. Toni O&apos;Loughlin in Sydney New Zealand Eleven New Zealand students who returned from an excursion to Mexico at the weekend have tested positive for swine flu while 18 people who shared the flight with the pupils are yet to be traced. New Zealand officials are investigating 45 other cases of suspected swine flu. . The government deployed a team of 25 to track the 364 passengers who shared the flight with the school party. One of the pupils played football soon after landing, before the alarm was sounded, potentially infecting his teammates and those of the opposition. Fear of a pandemic is rising, fuelling criticism that New Zealand officials have been slow to act. One passenger who shared the flight with the Rangitoto College students, Ian Hooker, said he was contacted on Monday morning, more than 48 hours after the flight had landed. &quot;We have been placed under quarantine as a result of today and I just can&apos;t help wondering whether that couldn&apos;t have been done on Sunday given that they knew about it on Saturday,&quot; Hooker said. Although he had no symptoms, he was given Tamiflu and told to stay indoors for up to seven days. Testing in New Zealand has taken longer as the samples needed to be sent to a WHO lab in Melbourne, Australia. Meanwhile, New Zealanders will have to wait till Friday for Tamiflu to be available over the counter at pharmacies. Toni O&apos;Loughlin in Sydney Ireland The department of health in Dublin will release swine flu test results later today on four Irish people who have returned from abroad. The results will be released at a press conference after clinical tests lasting up to five hours. Dr Kevin Kelleher, head of health protection at the Republic&apos;s health service executive, confirmed the suspected cases had recently returned from areas affected by the outbreak. He said further tests would be expected on the public in the coming week. Ireland&apos;s chief medical officer said the Republic was well prepared for an outbreak of swine flu. Dr Tony Holohan, from the department of heath, said the country had enough stocks of anti-viral drugs to cover up to half of its population. Ireland&apos;s health service executive is advising any Irish citizen who has returned from Mexico, California or Texas within the last seven days and developed an influenza-like illness to phone their family doctor for advice. The Irish government has so far declined to ban flights to affected countries or issue advice to travellers not to visit them. There was little sign of panic on the streets. The main talking point in Dublin today \u2011 and the lead item in the first edition of the city&apos;s evening paper, the Evening Herald \u2011 was the third day of an unofficial wildcat bus strike in the Irish capital. The department of foreign affairs has said about 300 Irish people live in Mexico and about 1,000 Irish people are currently on holiday there. Henry McDonald in Ireland Israel Israeli health officials said today that they had found their first confirmed case of swine flu. Two Israelis have been in hospital quarantine with flu-like symptoms since Sunday after returning recently from Mexico. Doctors believe one, a man aged 26 who has been in hospital in Netanya, has swine flu although he is reported to be in good condition. Tests on the second patient in hospital in Kfar Sava continue. Health ministry officials said they were advising Israelis to put off any non-essential travel to Mexico and to stay alert about reports of swine flu in other countries. Israelis returning from Mexico were told to see a doctor if they developed flu symptoms within seven days and that they would be quarantined in hospital until the cause of their illness was determined. Warning signs have been put up at the country&apos;s main airport, Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv. Until now there has been relatively little concern in Israel about the spread of the illness, except for the name it should be given. Yakov Litzman, Israel&apos;s deputy health minister and an ultra-Orthodox Jew, said the name &quot;swine flu&quot; was offensive to Jews who do not eat pork. &quot;We will call it Mexico flu. We won&apos;t call it swine flu,&quot; he said on Monday. Litzman said he was giving two daily briefings to the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, about the illness. There were sufficient stocks of Tamifluto treat 18% of the population and a budget to buy enough drugs to treat a quarter of the population if necessary, he said. &quot;If there&apos;s a catastrophe and the need arises to immediately increase the stock by several million pills this should not be a problem, thanks to various agreements we have,&quot; said Danny Laor, head of the health ministry&apos;s emergency unit. Rory McCarthy in Jerusalem Spain Spain&apos;s close ties with Mexico have made it the first country to import swine flu into Europe with a second case confirmed this morning in Valencia and a third expected later today in the north-eastern region of Catalonia. Groups of university students returning from spring breaks in Cancun and other Mexican resorts brought the virus into Spain last week. The announcement yesterday that Antonio Gil, a 23-year-old student in the eastern town of Almansa, had tested positive brought the now familiar blue face masks on to television screens while the government and doctors called for calm. Twenty-seven people are confined to hospitals and being tested for the virus. Local health authorities said Gil was recovering well but would be held in observation for up to a week. Passengers on flights from Mexico are inspected on arrival and made to fill out forms detailing where they have been and how they can be contacted. The health minister, Soledad Jimen\u00e9z, said yesterday that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;. There are, however, signs of confusion: Jimen\u00e9z contradicted health officials this morning by claiming Gil might be discharged today. It was reported that the patient in the second confirmed case of swine flu was discharged from hospital, only to be recalled hours later when a second set of tests showed positive. Spaniards have not panicked. Twenty blue plastic barrels of anti-viral medicine stored at a military base contain some 10m doses. The medicine was bought during the bird flu scare. Giles Tremlett in Madrid China China says it has no confirmed or probable cases. A school in Shaanxi, a northern province, has been closed as a precautionary measure after children developed flu-like symptoms, but it is thought unlikely that swine flu is responsible. A Chinese health ministry spokesman, Mao Qun&apos;an, told state media that the government had demanded that all medical bodies increase monitoring and immediately notify it of any suspected cases. Entry-exit and quarantine officials have also been told to strengthen inspections and disinfection procedures. Other precautions include banning pork imports from Mexico and affected American states, although experts say that consumption does not pose a transmission risk. Dr Hans Troedsson, the WHO representative in China, said the country had learned important lessons after officials were heavily criticised for covering up the Sars outbreak in 2002-03. The disease killed hundreds on the mainland and in Hong Kong. But he added: &quot;The sheer number [of people here] makes it extremely difficult to have a perfect surveillance system.Other challenges [include] the migrant population. They are not always registered so they can seek healthcare \u2011 and of course it is not good if people aren&apos;t getting at least medical advice if they have any symptoms.&quot; Chinese websites, news programmes and newspapers have led with news of the spread of swine flu, and official publications have underlined the need for openness in the wake of the Sars scandal. The People&apos;s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, stressed the public&apos;s right to know about health issues, adding: &quot;Disclosure of information will help to swiftly sever channels of infection.&quot; Tania Branigan in Beijing", "publicationDate": "2009-04-28T12:19:24Z", "title": "Swine flu cases spread around the world", "sentences": ["Warning signs have been put up at the country&apos;s main airport, Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/28/swine-flu-cases-around-world"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "World news"], "article": "The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office must be commended for its decision to cancel renting premises for the UK embassy in Tel Aviv from the company Africa-Israel, owned by Israeli businessman and settlement builder Lev Leviev. This is an encouraging step that should now be backed by stronger sanctions against the building of the separation wall and the building of illegal settlements by Israel. Furthermore, the governments of Norway and Dubai should emulate the example set by the UK and sever their relationships with Leviev&apos;s companies. The Israeli paper Ha&apos;aretz reported on 3 March 2009 that &quot;Due to the public pressure&quot; several months ago in a special debate in parliament, Kim Howells of the Foreign Office was asked to explain plans to rent the embassy from Leviev. This pressure, by a letters campaign to the FCO, was initiated by Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine with human rights organisation Adalah-New York, followed by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein, former BBC correspondent Tim Llewellyn and hundreds of others. Further voices included Daniel Machover of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, Palestinian notables including Hanan Ashrawi, Mustafa Barghouti and Luisa Morgantini, vice president of the European parliament. The move was frozen after ambassador Tom Phillips requested details from Africa-Israel about its activities in the settlements. Subsequently, on 5 March, the BBC reported the FCO&apos;s Karen Kaufman saying that: &quot;We looked into the issue of Africa-Israel and settlements and settlement holdings and we asked for clarification .... The UK government has always regarded settlements as illegal, but what has happened in recent months is that we are looking for ways to make a difference on this issue.&quot; Still, despite the FCO decision, Leviev&apos;s companies persist in their goal, backed by the Land Redemption Fund to which Leviev is one the largest donors, of &quot;blurring the Green Line&quot; and connecting the illegally built Zufim settlement with Israeli communities inside the Green Line, retaining 6,000 dunams of the village Jayyous&apos;s land sequestered by the wall. This land grab is being facilitated by the enforced construction of the apartheid wall, which the International Court of Justice firmly judged to be illegal under international law in 2004, and demanded its removal. There are weekly non-violent protests by the Jayyous villagers, Israeli and international peace groups, together with Bil&apos;in to stop their precious land from being taken to expand settlements and build the wall. These are being suppressed by Israeli forces on a terror rampage with live fire, beatings, tear gassings, mass arrests, house occupations and, more recently, threats of home demolitions, and pogroms. Following an Israeli supreme court ruling that the route of the wall in Jayyous should be moved slightly, Israeli authorities are trying to blackmail Jayyous&apos;s mayor, saying if he doesn&apos;t accept the new wall route, there will be no gates in it for the village&apos;s farmers to access their lands. The mayor has refused to sign. Without international intervention, Jayyous will not be able to hold on to its lands behind the wall, which contain their four vital agricultural wells and most of their greenhouses. Leviev will then be able to freely expand Zufim on to Jayyous&apos;s stolen lands. Currently, Leviev is building 35 new housing units in Zufim. At Bil&apos;in, where Leviev companies are also building settlements, mainstream media failed to cover the 17 April murder of Bil&apos;in non-violent protester Bassem Abu Rahmeh, 29, by Israeli forces. A soldier shot him with the same new type of &quot;rocket&quot; tear gas round, as fast and lethal as live ammunition that left US activist Tristan Anderson in critical condition. The brutal crackdown in Bil&apos;in continues despite three Israeli supreme court orders to move the wall in Bil&apos;in closer to the Matityahu East settlement &quot;outpost&quot; where Leviev&apos;s Danya Cebus built about 30% of the units. Israel&apos;s court has shown itself to be the accessory of this land grab. Israel&apos;s architects, designing these settlements, are also in breach of professional ethics, and will be held to account by their international peers. While the US, UK and the EU seem to be keen to join Israel, the perpetrator of war crimes, in boycotting the Palestinians who are the victims of crippling sieges, deadly incursions and a prison-like occupation, they are reluctant to take any positive action to stop Israel&apos;s breaches of international law. For instance, the Norwegian government has invested \u20ac875m in 2008 in Africa-Israel. By investing its populace&apos;s pension fund in a company at the heart of illegal Israeli settlement building, the country that sponsored the Oslo accords violates its spirit. Norway should follow the precedent set by the UK&apos;s FCO, in one of the latter&apos;s few bold moves, and divest from this company. The United Arab Emirates is also shamefully equivocating after a year-long campaign against Leviev selling his diamonds in the emirate of Dubai. Dubai&apos;s government, despite repeated assurances that Leviev would not be allowed to open two diamond boutiques in the emirate, has allowed Leviev to open stores under another name while his website advertises a Leviev store-in-store at one of the &quot;Levant&quot; shops of his Dubai partner, Arif bin Khadra. A second Levant store in Dubai&apos;s Atlantis hotel boldly touts the Leviev brand. If Dubai does not wish to be become known as the &quot;emirate that supports settlements&quot;, it should take immediate action, and follow the UK&apos;s lead and demonstrate it will not allow Leviev to profit from this indirect funding of his settlement building, that steals the future of Jayyous&apos;s children who are growing up in the shadow of Leviev&apos;s ever-expanding Zufim settlement. While the new Netanyahu/Leiberman government is doing all it can to obfuscate the issue of a proper peace settlement to establish a viable Palestinian state, a clear message must be sent to Israel. The sanctions against Leviev should be the start of a wider boycott of all who profit from the enforced acquisition of Palestinian land.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-28T13:30:00Z", "title": "Abe Hayeem: Boycott this Israeli settlement builder", "sentences": ["The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office must be commended for its decision to cancel renting premises for the UK embassy in Tel Aviv from the company Africa-Israel, owned by Israeli businessman and settlement builder Lev Leviev."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/28/israel-boycott-leviev"}, {"tags": ["Politics"], "article": "\u2022 Consistency is the watchword today. Time to tighten our belts, says the government. Please take us back, darling prudence.

About \u00a33.6m, according to post office minister Pat McFadden. Where are you going now, prudence? Come back. Please. We&apos;ll stop doing it. \u2022 Yes, consistency - saying what you mean and meaning what you say. Here is Daniel Clarke, writing seven months ago as prospective Labour parliamentary candidate for Eastleigh. &quot;It is difficult for us Labour PPCs to be sure which Tories we will be facing at the general election. It seems that with every passing day another Tory PPC resigns,&quot; he said. It &quot;suggests that the Tories are not vetting their candidates very effectively, maybe they are just desperate for anyone they can get&quot;. Here is Daniel Clarke, writing at the weekend. &quot;It is with great sadness that I have decided to resign as a Labour PPC and a Labour party member. My period as a PPC has been difficult to say the least.&quot; He&apos;s off to the Liberal Democrats, showering praise on Chris Huhne - the man he was to oppose at the next election. A fighter not a quitter.  \u2022 Consistency is the thing, so good wishes go to Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the movement to boycott Israeli academia, who has opted - according to the Jewish Chronicle - to take doctoral courses at Tel Aviv University, having studied for his BA and master&apos;s degree at Columbia University in the US. &quot;My studies at Tel Aviv University are a personal matter and I have no interest in commenting,&quot; he is reported to have told the Ma&apos;ariv newspaper when contacted. A student, but also a teacher.  \u2022 And though it is too early to say what effect swine flu will have on the already battered world economy, there is no doubt that it presents serious challenges to many, many countries. For some, the issue is &quot;what shall we call it?&quot; Israel&apos;s ultra-orthodox deputy health minister Yakov Litzman reveals the thinking there. &quot;We will call it Mexico flu. We won&apos;t call it swine flu,&quot; Litzman told a news conference, reiterating the obvious fact that pigs are not kosher. He may find Muslim countries agree. He has the plan, an acceptable name and one confirmed case. Israel is ready.  \u2022 Though we know better than to make comment on ongoing court cases, it should not go without notice that Tom Wise, the ex-Ukipian MEP for the east of England, now an independent and most importantly the unofficial film critic for this column, was up before the beak this week accused of claiming at least \u00a336,000 in secretarial allowances under the guise of a salary for his researcher Lindsay Jenkins. Prosecutors alleged he spent the money on a car, fine wines, and paid off credit card and bank debts. Both deny the charges. We cannot say much more, good or ill, other than report that both were released on conditional bail. And that whatever the verdict of the jury, we shall accept it.  \u2022 When a member of the celebrity class speaks out we think it polite to listen. The Hollywood star Ben Affleck has done just that.

My wife was like, &apos;You must have a made bed&apos;. It&apos;s crazy.&quot; She is right, of course, for the convention is that a bed should be made each day; but he too is right to ask whether it is necessary to conform to the habits passed down by our parents and imposed upon us by wider society.

Across the country, activists in a publicly registered, pacifist non-profit organisation were detained. Their computers were confiscated, and they were banned from contacting each other or trying to restore the data on their seized PCs. After a triumphalist press statement by the police, more activists were called in and interrogations are expected to widen further still. In case you haven&apos;t guessed, the country where these events took place is Israel. The NGO in question is New Profile, a feminist organisation working against the IDF draft. The targeting of New Profile, cynically timed to the eve of Israel&apos;s Memorial Day (on which most Israelis will have been remembering a loved one lost to conflict) is profoundly symbolic of the speed at which Israeli society is militarising yet further. New Profile claims that Israel is soaked in militarism; top-ranking retired generals run many private and governmental companies or serve in government, the education system and the army are joining forces to have one uniformed officer stationed in every high school in the country, and adverts and TV programmes feature much more uniformed characters than those of most ostensibly democratic nations. And the pressure keeps piling up. For the first time, secular teenage girls objecting to the draft are being jailed. Religious teenagers, who until now had the easiest time avoiding draft through reasons of modesty and piety, are now being followed around by military police and private investigators, who photograph them kissing or wearing &quot;immodest&quot; clothing, and feed the racy pictures to the daily press. The coercion, mounts up to a little-known but grisly statistic: the IDF, one of the most active armies in the industrialised world, loses more soldiers through suicide than in any other way, including the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. According to the IDF&apos;s own data, 205 soldiers died in Israeli military action or Palestinian attacks between 2000 and 2006, the anomaly of the second Lebanese war excluded. During the same period of time, 236 soldiers killed themselves. Human rights organisations suspect the latter number might be even higher. The most recent suicide in the IDF took place last Wednesday, and hardly got any coverage at all. New Profile encourages critical thinking on the part of Israeli youths by exposing them to information about human rights abuses carried out by and within the IDF. Even more crucially, it provides free counselling to those wishing to become conscientious objectors, leave the army on grounds of mental health, or even to replace the draft by volunteering for national civic service. For these sins, eight key activists have been detained for questioning, and the organisation&apos;s computers have been confiscated. On these are databases and correspondence containing personal information on thousands of Israeli young people, many of whom are politically active. The acquisition of this data by the police allows the state undreamt-of opportunities for political blackmail. Such measures aren&apos;t confined to pesky NGOs. Take Jaffa actor and filmmaker Samieh Jabbarin, who demonstrated against a radical rightwing action in his home town in February. Jabbarin was put under house arrest, in his parents&apos; town, away from his workplace and actual home. Yesterday his house arrest had clocked the 65th day \u2013 only to be extended by the court by five more months, until September 2009. Neither is Jabbarin the only one to have been clearly signalled that rules for dissent are changing fast. Over 800 protesters, most of them Palestinian-Israelis, have been arrested during the war. Others, including a member of the Tel Aviv municipal council, have been summoned from their homes to several consecutive interrogations, both by police and the Shin Bet, which proceeded to threaten them with prosecution for abiding the enemy at a time of war. Arrested demonstrators found themselves facing an unprecedented threat of extended remands (traditionally, you are detained and released within 24 hours), based on suspicions of the &quot;increased risk&quot; they posed to public safety, on occasion supported by &quot;secret evidence&quot; the judges read but cannot disclose. The more you zoom out, the bleaker the picture is. Over the past 18 months, many of the defences between civil liberties and state authorities have been methodically dismantled. A communications information amendment had been added to the Israeli criminal law in December 2007, allowing police and the general security service (Shin Bet) to acquire IP and cellphone serial numbers of just about anyone, bypassing the courts. A Biometric Database Act was launched last October, providing for an imprisonment to citizens who fail to supply their fingerprints once the data-gathering operation has begun. And perhaps the most important mechanism preserving Israel&apos;s creaky democracy, the supreme court, had been cowed by a sustained assault from the recently retired justice minister Dr Daniel Friedmann, who had been trying to increase government influence in the appointment of its judges and to bar the court from intervening in legislative matters. The latter is a crucial point, as Israel has no effective constitution to curb the whims and ambitions of gung-ho legislators. The change of government brought little relief, as a radically authoritarian and ethno-nationalist party (Yisrael Beiteinu) is now in control of the ministry of internal security, supervising the police. Samieh Jabbarin had lost his freedom without having even been indicted. The New Profile activists could face up to 15 years imprisonment each for &quot;inciting and abiding desertion at war&quot; (legally, Israel is perpetually &quot;at war&quot;). And all this, of course, is peanuts compared to the suppression faced by activists in the West Bank , those who assist them, and by all who have the misfortune of living in the Gaza Strip. The trouble with authoritarianism is that it doesn&apos;t always come at once; troops don&apos;t have to flood the streets, a grotesque dictator does not necessarily pop out in the middle of your evening news. These developments seem menacing when gathered in one article, but to most of us Israelis, especially those uninvolved politically, they are secondary news items at best, or else vaguely remembered as temporary and insignificant allowances made for our own safety. The same people who defend every Israeli folly by harping on about it being the only democracy in the Middle East, are tirelessly working to turn it into a caricature autocracy. Most depressingly, even the briefest of glances at comment threads on any Israeli news site suggests that through disinformation and fear-mongering, these efforts enjoy unwavering popular support.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-30T15:38:37Z", "title": "Israel's budding autocracy | Dimi Reider", "sentences": ["Others, including a member of the Tel Aviv municipal council, have been summoned from their homes to several consecutive interrogations, both by police and the Shin Bet, which proceeded to threaten them with prosecution for abiding the enemy at a time of war."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/30/israel-military"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "article": "I&apos;d rather have James IV I doubt Scottish readers will share Jonathan Jones&apos;s assessment of Henry VIII as the man who &quot;placed Britain in the international swim of the Renaissance&quot; (&quot;Lust for life&quot;, 25 April).

Since Fara aims to see science in its historical context, Joseph Needham&apos;s statement in a lecture to the China Society in London in 1946 seems relevant. &quot;What is really very badly needed,&quot; he said, &quot;is a proper book on the history of science and technology in China, especially with reference to the social and economic background of Chinese life.&quot; Needham proceeded to provide this over the following decades, writing a number of volumes in Science and Civilisation in China and initiating a magnificent project that is not yet complete. Ferry mentioned Francis Bacon but failed to tell us that the three inventions Bacon identified as having done most to transform the modern world - paper and printing, gunpowder, and the magnetic compass - were all Chinese. John Hort Nottingham More nuance required Daphna Baram&apos;s review of Rachel Shabi&apos;s Not the Enemy: Israel&apos;s Jews from Arab Lands (&quot;Life on the edges&quot;, 25 April) makes a number of debatable points.

In the 1980s she met, and subsequently became a close friend and colleague of, the psychoanalyst Marion Milner, an original theoretician who emphasised the healing power of unconscious psychic creativity. Milner suggested to Farhi that she should take her work into arenas where, for reasons of age, Milner herself could no longer go. With characteristic courage, generosity and intellectual thoroughness, Farhi took Milner&apos;s legacy as her li fe&apos;s work. She was involved, through her long career, with extremely damaged and disturbed people in intensive, four- or five-times weekly psychoanalytic therapy.  She lectured extensively in London and internationally and became a visiting lecturer at Bar Ilan University, near Tel Aviv. Her series of groundbreaking papers, in journals such as Contemporary Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Dialogues, explored the ways in which, in work with patients from backgrounds of extreme emotional deprivation, she sought the most primitive elements that had enabled some form of psychological survival. Unafraid to draw from Jewish mysticism as well as a range of psychoanalytists, she could see the spark of holiness in the domain of evil, the drive towards self-realisation in bizarre and chaotic experiences with her patients. Nina had recently finished an insightful, creative extension of an initative by Milner, who died in 1998. This paper, In the Hands of the Living God (echoing the title of Milner&apos;s 1969 publication, The Hands of the Living God), will be published posthumously in Psychoanalytic Dialogues. Prior to her death Nina was compiling notes for two major papers on perversion and anorexia, both earmarked for the same journal.  She was born Nina Ruth Gould in troubled lower-middle-class circumstances in north London. Her grandparents had been Polish and east Galician Jewish immigrants who had settled in the East End. Unsurprisingly, Nina became intensely involved in the class and racial politics of her day. Ill-health prevented her from pursuing a PhD thesis on a historical perspective on immigrants, particularly Jews who came to the UK in the early 20th century. Later, when her chronic condition, lobular hepatitis, became manageable, she turned to psychoanalysis and rose rapidly to prominence.  Nina became an inspirational teacher and supervisor in her training organisation, the Guild of Psychotherapists, and remained on their training committee for 10 years from 1989 to 1999. For many years, she supervised the staff team at the Whittington hospital&apos;s erstwhile Belle Ridley Day hospital (now the Dartmouth Park Unit), an NHS psychiatric unit in north London committed to the long-term care and treatment of some of the most damaged people in our society.  She was a founder member in 1980 of the Squiggle Foundation, the organisation devoted to the work of the pioneering psychoanalyst and paediatrician Donald Winnicott. During her time as director (1989-96), Nina held regular Saturday meetings in her home on themes in his work. Many of the participants became well-known clinicians and authors, within and outside psychoanalysis.  As Nina was unstintingly generous in her work, so she was with her friends, colleagues and the many people who sought her counsel. She became a mentor - through her robust and sometimes proud personal example of her faith in the possibilities of what a life could achieve and become - and all this through long-term illness, disability and pain that was determinedly shrugged off.  She had been afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus from the early 1980s: this was never allowed to impinge on her plans for her own life or those of others. Her friends were so accustomed to her resolute denial of physical pain and her indomitable spirit that none of us recognised in her deteriorating physical condition the possibility of a terminal illness; and nor did she.  She is survived by her husband, Musa (the novelist Moris Farhi), whom she married in 1978, her daughter Rachel (Sievers), and her granddaughter Zara. \u2022 Nina Farhi, psychoanalytic psychotherapist, born 1 December 1943; died 21 March 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-05-05T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Nina Farhi", "sentences": ["She lectured extensively in London and internationally and became a visiting lecturer at Bar Ilan University, near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/06/obituary-nina-farhi"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "I first visited Israel in 1969. It was a time when much of the western world was still passionately enthused about the country&apos;s triumph in the 1967 six-day war. President Nasser had for years promised to sweep the Israelis into the sea. Instead, the tiny Jewish state, less than 20 years old, had engaged the armies of three Arab nations, and crushingly defeated them all. The Israelis successively smashed through Nasser&apos;s divisions on the western front, scaled and seized the Golan Heights, and snatched east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the face of Hussein&apos;s highly capable Jordanian army. Sinai was left strewn with the boots of fleeing Egyptians. The Israeli victory was an awesome display of command boldness, operational competence and human endeavour. There was a euphoria in Israel in those days, which many visitors shared. We watched Jews from all over the world gathering to pray at the Wailing Wall for the first time in almost 2,000 years; Israelis of all ages revelling in the sensation of being able to work the kibbutzim of the north free from Syrian shells. From inhabiting one of the most claustrophobic places in the world, suddenly they found themselves free to roam miles across Sinai on a weekend. The soldiers of the Israeli army, careerists, conscripts and reservists alike, walked 10ft tall \u2013 the image of an exulting soldier made it on to the cover of Life magazine. They had shown themselves one of the greatest fighting forces of history, expunging almost at a stroke the memory of Jewish impotence in the face of centuries of persecution, of six million being herded helpless into cattle trucks for the death camps. In the years that followed, I gazed across the Suez Canal during the artillery bombardments of the 1970 war of attrition with Egypt. I was a correspondent there in October 1973, during the Yom Kippur war. It was an extraordinarily moving spectacle, to behold the people of Israel rallying to meet what they perceived as a threat to their national survival. One morning I stood on the Golan Heights and watched Israeli tanks duelling with the Syrians, amid pillars of smoke and flame. A few nights later I bivouacked in the Sinai passes, talking for hours under the stars to Israeli reservists about their hopes and fears. With a colleague from the Financial Times, having thinly disguised ourselves as Israeli soldiers, we made an illicit night crossing of the Suez canal, to report Ariel Sharon&apos;s stunning encirclement operation which trapped the Egyptian army on the east bank. In those days I loved those people, and boundlessly admired their achievement. I wrote in one of my less temperate dispatches, expressing faith in Israel as a bastion of western civilization in the Middle East: &quot;These last three weeks, I am proud to have shared the Israelis&apos; camp fires in Sinai. They are a very great people who three weeks ago came closer to destruction than blind Europe seems willing to recognise.&quot; After I came home from the Yom Kippur war, I received a note from the renowned journalist, James Cameron. Jimmy, a longstanding Zionist, wrote warmly about my reporting. He said: &quot;It is impossible to work in combat with the Israeli army without this response, if you have any sense of history and drama.&quot; But then he added: &quot;I have sometimes wondered over the past few years whether this irresistible military mesmerism hasn&apos;t clouded for us some of the political falsities. I just don&apos;t know. I think I was marginally led up the garden in 1967.&quot; Jimmy&apos;s tentative note roused the first stirrings in my mind of ideas which evolved only slowly in the years which followed. Remember, I was still in my 20s. I had always loved soldiers. I was enthused by the romance of the battlefield.\u00a0 I possessed an excessive respect for military prowess. Ironically, it was the experience of spending much more time with the Israeli army in the mid-1970s, in the course of researching a book, which caused me to begin to perceive the importance of what Cameron said. I glimpsed a darker side of Israel. I learned a lot about the ruthlessness of Israeli anti-terrorist operations. I spent many hours talking to thoughtful Israelis, who voiced their fears about the perils, the threatened corruption of their own society, which they perceived in the 1967 conquests. I also became dismayed by the naked imperialism displayed by Israel&apos;s rightwing zealots. One night at a dinner party in Jerusalem in 1977, I heard a young Israeli talking about the Arabs in terms which chilled my blood. &quot;In the next war,&quot; he said, &quot;we&apos;ve got to get the Palestinians out of the West Bank for good.&quot; To me, in my naivete, Israel&apos;s struggle had hitherto seemed that of a brilliant little people, who had suffered the most ghastly experience of the 20th century, struggling for survival amid a hostile Middle East still bent upon their destruction. Now, suddenly, I found myself meeting Israelis committed to the creation of a greater Israel embracing the West Bank, who were utterly heedless of the fate of its inhabitants. The Palestinians were perceived as losers, a mere incidental impediment to the fulfilment of Israel&apos;s historic territorial destiny. By a curious quirk, that young Israeli whom I heard enthuse about emptying the West Bank of Arabs was Binyamin Netanyahu, today his country&apos;s prime minister. Listening to Israelis such as himself speaking of the Palestinians 30 years ago, I began to understand what a more thoughtful young man than myself might have seen from the outset: the huge danger implicit in rooting a society&apos;s polity in its military prowess and powers of conquest. When I said something of the kind to a politician of the Israeli right, he responded contemptuously: &quot;You are a typical European. You loved Israel when it was a victim. Now you turn your face from us, because we have become too strong for your taste. We are no longer Jews on our knees, begging for pity.&quot; I had lunch one day in Jerusalem in 1979 with that brilliant Israeli novelist and peacenik Amoz Oz, who said something of the same kind, but from a different perspective: &quot;People like you,&quot; he said to me, &quot;are going to become very disappointed in Israel in the years ahead. You want it to behave like a European society. Instead, it is becoming a Middle Eastern society. I hope that it will not behave worse than other Middle Eastern societies. But you should not delude yourself that it is likely to behave much better.&quot; This seemed a profound observation. The generation of Israelis whom I met, and embraced, in the late 1960s and early 1970s were overwhelmingly formed by the diaspora from which they came. In the decades since, as they have died, their society has become dominated by those forged by different experiences \u2013 either of whole lifetimes in the fevered hothouse of Israel, or by immigration from Russia, whence so many newcomers have arrived in recent times. Three years ago in Jerusalem, I met a very bright couple in their late 40s, who had emigrated from Russia a decade earlier. When we began to speak of the Palestinians, the husband said: &quot;In my Russian village in 1920, there was trouble with guerrillas. Budenny&apos;s Cossacks came. They burnt the village from which the guerrillas came. The guerrillas returned twice more. The Cossacks burned two more villages. Then there was no more trouble with guerrillas.&quot; This was the culture from which these two highly-educated Israelis came. They asserted that the Budenny method was the only proper one by which to address Hamas, Hizbollah and Fatah. The policies of recent Israeli governments suggest that their view is widely shared. Between the late 1970s and 1990s, I was one of those foreigners who progressively fell out of love with Israel. I became persuaded that the arrogance of its faith in its own military power had induced its people to go far beyond a belief in defending their own society, to support a polity committed to perpetuating a great historic injustice against the Palestinians. Whatever government is in power in Jerusalem, there is a belief that peace with the Muslim world is unattainable; and thus that Israel must resign itself to a future dependent on its military capability rather than on negotiation. Associated with this is a belief that Jewish colonisation of the West Bank is a price the Palestinians must expect to pay for their refusal to make peace. The most extraordinary, indeed nihilistic aspect of Israeli military policy towards the Palestinians is that it has sought to punish terrorism by deliberately wrecking the economic base of Palestinian society. On its own terms, this has succeeded. Today the only thriving industries in Palestinian territory are human reproduction, terrorism, and the propagation of grievances. The conditions in Gaza are, to us, almost unimaginable. Few have work. Most live in breezeblock barracks. From one year to the next they see nothing that is beautiful except the sea and sky. Hatred for their oppressors has become the only functioning engine of their society. People who have nothing have nothing to lose. The policies of modern Israel have created the certainty of new generations of neighbours committed to its undoing. The Palestinians&apos; only influence rests upon the power of such weapons as they can obtain, and upon their destructive capacity to broadcast terrorism. Who can be surprised that the people of Gaza elected a Hamas government? No sane society engages an overwhelmingly militarily superior nation on the battlefield on terms which suit the possessor of power. There is no purpose in wasting rhetoric upon moral denunciations of terrorism or even suicide-bombing, especially so when Jewish terrorism played a substantial part in Israel&apos;s birth. The Palestinians, together with the Muslim world and many in the west, no longer believe that Israel will grant justice to their people by negotiation; they believe that only force might eventually drive the Israelis to make concessions. Israel suffers the same frustration on a regional scale as that which afflicts the US globally: the difficulty \u2013 some of us would argue impossibility \u2013 of leveraging overwhelming military power to make its will prevail upon the Palestinians. The Palestinians are incapable of imposing their own will on the Israelis. But poverty, misery and impotence represent weapons of their own. These things cause Israel to be regarded by a large part of the world as an oppressor. I often think that Israelis focus too much upon their past, not enough upon their future. In the days when I visited Israel regularly, dinner-table arguments about the nation&apos;s strategy became familiar. There would often come a moment when somebody would blurt out \u2013 justifying this or that aspect of Israeli policy: &quot;But you&apos;ve got to understand why we must do this \u2013 because of the Holocaust.&quot; For more than 60 years, the Holocaust card has been played again and again. Today in Europe, there is not the slightest danger that the unspeakable fate of the Jews in the 1940s will be forgotten. But many people, especially the young, no longer perceive the crimes of Hitler, however monstrous, as providing remotely adequate justification for \u2013 for instance \u2013 Israeli military excesses in Gaza and the appropriation of scarce water resources at Palestinian expense. The Holocaust argument is sometimes displaced by a more facile jibe: that those who criticise Israel are guilty of anti-semitism. I have been accused of this myself. Yet I take comfort from the number of Jews who express repugnance about Israel&apos;s excesses. Avi Shlaim has dissected the failures and deceits of modern Israeli policy far more convincingly than I could. Rabbi David Goldberg has described Israel&apos;s failure to create a plausible successor vision to that of the old Zionists. &quot;Zionism&apos;s most important achievement,&quot; he says, &quot;was to provide a haven for the escapees and survivors of Hitler&apos;s Holocaust.&quot; Today, by contrast, few western Jews want to live there. The Zionist claim, that the country is the natural home of Jews, is rejected by a majority of the world&apos;s 14 million Jews. Goldberg argues that &quot;Zionists claim that only in their own land can Jews lead a full, &apos;normal&apos; life without fear of anti-semitism. But the irony of Israel&apos;s geopolitical situation is that the average Jew walking the streets of Los Angeles, Golders Green or even Moscow is physically safer than the average Israeli walking in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.&quot; Many Jews no longer believe that the Zionist concept of entitlement, based first upon Biblical history, and latterly upon the Holocaust, suffices to justify perpetuating historic injustice upon the Arabs of Palestine. Benny Morris&apos;s excellent recent history of the events of 1948 shows that even a respected Israeli historian is today ready to acknowledge the scale of Israeli ethnic cleansing at the time, and of the deceits employed since to conceal what took place. The Israeli myth, that the Palestinians displaced in 1948 voluntarily abandoned their homes and property, is unsustainable in the face of such evidence. An Israeli listening to all this might interrupt angrily: &quot;But why do you say so little about Hamas and Hizbollah, rocketing and suicide-bombing innocent Israeli civilians?&quot; Yes, indeed \u2013 such acts must always be condemned. But what of proportionality? In recent years, for every Israeli killed by terrorism, the Israeli security forces have killed 30, 40, 50 Palestinians \u2013 most of them civilians. Israel exacts a blood price from the innocent of a severity which only tyrannies have historically thought appropriate. The entire thrust of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians in recent times has been to convey a crude message of overwhelming power, of Israel&apos;s ability to command, kill or destroy at will, without fear of sanctions. The Israeli army, which once exemplified much that was best about Israel, has today been corrupted by the long experience of suppressing insurgency. Morally, if not militarily, it is a shadow of the force which fought in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973. Israel has tested to destruction the utility of force in achieving its security. It is not enough to assert proudly that the Jewish state remains a democracy and haven of free speech in a region in which neither of these precious things is much in evidence, if that same democracy behaves in a fashion which denies mercy to the weak. For someone like me, who enjoyed a love affair with Israel 40\u00a0years ago, it is heart-breaking to see the story come to such a pass. It is because so many of us so much want to see Israel prosper in security and peace that we share a sense of tragedy that 61 years after the state was born amid such lofty ideals, it should be led by such a man as Bibi Netanyahu, committed to policies which can yield nothing honourable or lasting. Amoz Oz&apos;s 1979 prophesy to me has alas been fulfilled. It will be as great a misfortune for Israel as for the Palestinians, if its governments persist in their past delusions through the years ahead.

If the reports and analysis are to be believed, something is shifting, and the various players are staking out their positions in the changing landscape. One of the main questions being asked is whether the US and Israeli administrations are heading for a conflict. Many answer in the affirmative, including the Guardian&apos;s Simon Tisdall, who yesterday wrote that Israel is &quot;under siege&quot; as PM Netanyahu heads for &quot;showdown talks&quot; with Obama on 18 May. Other commentators have also perceived a &quot;widening rift between the U.S. and Israeli governments&quot;. This Friday, Israeli daily Ha&apos;aretz reported that Israeli officials are complaining about a &quot;sharp decline&quot; in US-Israel coordination &quot;on security and state affairs&quot;. Israel&apos;s lobbyists in the US are sufficiently worried to be already trying to &quot;forestall&quot; this &quot;significant shift&quot; in White House policy. They might have their work cut out however, if, as reported in the Israeli media, Netanyahu intends to tell Obama that he is only willing to accept &quot;Palestinian &apos;self-government&apos; &quot;, rather than a sovereign state (leaving aside that this has been the practical position of Israeli governments since Rabin). Apart from an explicit commitment to a two-state solution, the main issue that seems to have the potential to create US-Israeli discord is settlement construction. Work in Israel&apos;s West Bank colonies has accelerated in the last few months, which as Ha&apos;aretz noted, puts Israel &quot;on a collision course with a US administration taking a hard line on settlement expansion&quot;. Reportedly, Obama will &quot;demand Netanyahu completely suspend construction in the settlements&quot; when the two meet in a few weeks. It is clear that the Obama administration is developing a regionally focused plan for the Middle East that puts the Israeli-Palestinian conflict alongside relations with Syria, Lebanon, and how the Arab states relate to Israel. Details are thus far unknown, since nothing will be official until after Obama has met with Netanyahu, Egpytian president Hosni Mubarak, and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. This week, however, it was rumoured that the US was considering returning to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, having requested some changes in the content. According to a report in al-Quds al-Arabi, a redrafting of the plan was discussed during a meeting between Obama and Jordan&apos;s King Abdullah, and discussions were being held on the matter between the Jordanians, Egyptians, Palestinians, Saudis, and even Syrians. This has been subsequently denied as alleged changes include dropping the Palestinians&apos; right of return and the normalisation of relations between Israel and the Arab states. Since the story surfaced, Jordan&apos;s foreign minister stressed that the initiative would continue &quot;without change&quot;, while Arab League secretary-general Amr Moussa also said there was &quot;no amendment&quot;. Sensing an opportunity, the so-called &apos;moderate&apos; Arab regimes are intending to present Obama with a united front for concessionary peace talks intended to contrast with Netanyahu&apos;s inflexibility. A few days ago, Jordan&apos;s Abdullah talked about a &quot;package effort&quot;, to bring Israelis, Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Arab nations to the same (large) negotiating table. Perhaps the main difference between Obama and the Bush administration is a move away from policies determined almost entirely in Tel Aviv and Washington, to this emphasis on engagement and coordination with the Arab governments. But it is worth asking to what extent a &quot;new&quot; initiative is even needed. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking of Netanyahu&apos;s professed &quot;fresh approach to peace&quot;, remarked that &quot;implementing Israel&apos;s obligations under existing agreements is precisely the fresh approach that Palestinians and the international community expect of his government&quot;. There is no shortage of UN resolutions and international legal rulings that have long provided a framework for a settlement in Palestine/Israel \u2013 the problem has been implementation. This leads to the suspicion that a heralded &quot;new&quot; initiative will either be useless without the requisite political will, or worse still, will serve as a means to circumvent these principles in favour of a &quot;peace&quot; of the strong. What has already emerged in terms of the content of the US&apos;s (and the Quartet&apos;s) plan is enough to suggest serious doubts that this initiative can succeed where others have failed. The American idea of &quot;confidence-building gestures&quot; is almost a verbatim re-run of the bankrupt Oslo discourse, while Tony Blair&apos;s belief in economic peace from the &quot;bottom up&quot; in the West Bank means it is no surprise he believes Netanyahu can be a &quot;peacemaker&quot;. There are other question marks too, such as the US support for a Palestinian Authority that has taken a decidedly authoritarian turn under US and European tutelage. Perhaps the most fundamental question is exactly how forceful the US will be with Israel. While even freezing settlement construction may be objectionable to the extremists in Israel&apos;s cabinet, it is a token concession when compared to the expanding, solidifying colonial absorption of the Occupied Territories. Given that there are even doubts about the extent to which Obama&apos;s desire for engagement is reflective of his administration as a whole, the Palestinians are not jumping to any conclusions. A source in the PLO&apos;s Negotiations Affairs Department \u2013 whose maps Abbas will be taking to Washington \u2013 told me they cannot predict how US-Israeli relations will develop until Netanyahu&apos;s meeting with Obama. Unfortunately, it is likely that the enormous disparity between the peace process and the facts on the ground in the occupied territories will live on in any new initiative. The Palestinian people continue to seek basic political and human rights, rather than gestures and Jericho casinos. The two-state solution may be the only game in town, but there is no evidence that Obama can \u2013 or wants to \u2013 prevent it being a slogan masking apartheid.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-09T13:00:00Z", "title": "Peace in our time for the Middle East? | Ben White", "sentences": ["Perhaps the main difference between Obama and the Bush administration is a move away from policies determined almost entirely in Tel Aviv and Washington, to this emphasis on engagement and coordination with the Arab governments."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/09/israel-middle-east-peace-process"}, {"tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style"], "article": "The first time it happened, or the first time I can remember it happening, was in 1978, when I was nine. I was on holiday in the Loire valley with my mother, my stepfather and my brother. It was a holiday of firsts: my first trip abroad; my first snails and proper yoghurt; my first fizzy mineral water. It was also the occasion of my first full-blown migraine attack - which perhaps is why all these other details are still so clear to me. On the night in question, we were staying in a small creeper-covered hotel in a town called Bl\u00e9r\u00e9. The day had been spent visiting the requisite ch\u00e2teau, where we had a roadside picnic of bread, soft cheese and jam, after which we had come back to the hotel for a siesta: we would be eating a lot later than we did at home in Sheffield. But I had not been able to sleep - what was the point of sleeping in the day, when the sun was still shining? - and the afternoon had passed agonisingly slowly. I was glad that we would soon be going down. In fact, I could hardly wait. Even then I was greedy. I was wearing a denim skirt my mother had made me, and a polo neck the colour of salmon lipstick. I thought it very fetching. It started in the final tantalising hour before dinner: the pain in my head. At first it wasn&apos;t too bad. It throbbed, but if I was careful, and avoided looking directly into the light, and held my head at a certain angle, I could just about bear it. So I sat very still, and I waited, hoping it would shift by the time my mother came to our room to get us. But it didn&apos;t shift. It was getting very much worse. It was starting to make me feel sick. When my mother arrived, she looked at me - knowing what I know now, I must have been completely grey - and asked if I was OK. I said: &quot;I&apos;ve just got a bit of a headache.&quot; I played it down because no one likes a killjoy, and also because I had got my salmon sweater on, and I was damned if I was not going to have that lovely long menu haltingly explained to me while some waiter looked on admiringly. So she gave me a soluble aspirin - my mother always had soluble aspirin to hand - and I drank it down, and hoped it would work especially quickly. I remember, vividly, the feeling of gathering myself. I was only nine, yet I was contemplating the hours ahead in the same way that an arthritic old lady contemplates a set of stairs. How were they to be negotiated without some terrible crisis of pain?  After this, my memory grows more hazy.  I think that I managed to eat a starter before it became obvious to me, and to the rest of my family, that I could not remain at supper. Behind my right eye, something was going on: something terrible. It was as if someone was beating me with a poker, except that the person perpetrating this frenzied attack was inside my skull, trying to bash their way out. The pain seemed to have taken control of me. I could hardly see; I could hardly talk; I could hardly move. It had rendered me entirely abject. Who cared what anyone thought now? If I had been able, I would have crawled under the dining table and tried to go to sleep then and there, curled and clammy: anything rather than to have to make the nauseous journey back to my bedroom. My mother, though, could see what was on the horizon, which was a fiesta of vomiting. So she led me out, a guide through the dark tunnel, and put me to bed, and for the next few hours, while the three of them ate rillettes de porc and confit de canard and the finest camembert, I lay in bed as still as stone, my torture punctuated only by pathetic crawls to the lavatory, where I would lay my aching head on the edge of the bowl and enjoy the fleeting relief afforded by extremely violent puking. &quot;That no one dies of migraine seems, to someone deep into an attack, an ambiguous blessing,&quot; writes Joan Didion in her essay &quot;In Bed&quot;. Aged nine, I had neither heard of Didion nor read her essay. But I already understood the sentiment. &quot;You&apos;ll feel better in the morning,&quot; said my mother, when she came up to bed. This was not comforting. How was I expected to last that long? So I have had migraines since I was nine years old, though my mother thinks that it really began even earlier, in the form of unusual and unexplained stomach upsets (childhood migraine often manifests itself this way at first). I feel strange about telling you this because I don&apos;t want you to think that I am some odd and feeble Elizabeth Barrett Browning figure who spends days at a time prone on a chaise longue, waiting for her latest attack of the vapours to pass. Then again, thinking about this piece, and researching it, has reinforced the position I have always held so far as my own migraine goes. I am not mad, nor are my symptoms psychosomatic. The World Health Organisation, no less, has recently described migraine as one of the four most disabling chronic medical disorders. At a conservative estimate, migraine affects between 10% and 12% of the population at some point; in the UK, this amounts to 6 million people. I am not, then, alone even if, when I am in the middle of an attack, it often feels that way. Among the more famous migraineurs are Vincent van Gogh, Virginia Woolf, Elvis Presley, Lewis Carroll, Julius Caesar, Emily Dickinson and Sigmund Freud. Not bad company to keep, though I would be happy hanging out with Frederick Forsyth and Jordan if this meant that I no longer got headaches. By the standards of many migraineurs, I am lucky. I have about six attacks a year, at most. When Joan Didion was writing in 1968, she was losing four days a week to her headache.  Ten per cent of sufferers get them weekly, and 14% more than 15 days a month. Still, when they come, they are shockingly bad. A migraine is not just another stress headache; it is utterly debilitating. When one catches me, unprepared, in a public place, it is also utterly humiliating, except that the pain is so cruel you only feel humiliated afterwards; at the time you could not care less if someone has mistaken you for a drunk.  The worst attack I ever had - both in terms of pain, and humiliation - occurred four years ago. I was trying to leave Israel, where I&apos;d been working. Unfortunately a small white lie that I had told to ease my passage through security ended with me being strip searched, and very late for the plane. Lots of things trigger a migraine, almost always in combination, and this debacle was a perfect storm for my poor little brain: a lack of sleep through an early start; an absence of breakfast, or anything else to eat, which had led to a rapidly falling level of blood sugar; the stress of the security process; the air-conditioned atmosphere of the airport.  I tried to tell the girl who was searching me that I needed to have something to eat and drink - anything - as a matter of urgency. But, no joy. By the time I got on the plane I was in agony. By the time the plane was in the air I was vomiting uncontrollably in my seat, a real mess. The man next to me looked appalled, though he didn&apos;t bother to ask if I was OK. I arrived in London, swaying and sticky, somehow negotiated passport control, and then I lay on a bench in baggage reclaim looking for all the world like a disgraceful junkie. My hair was matted. I stank.  I could barely form a coherent sentence. And then, suddenly, there was light. The migraine lifted. I went into WH Smith, where I bought a can of Coke and some fruit pastilles - in post-migraine euphoria I crave sugar like you would not believe - and then I made my way home.  I was as frail as glass, but I was better. It is generally agreed that by the time the full pain of a migraine kicks in, you have already been suffering from an attack for a while, perhaps for up to 24 hours. In this period, before the crisis, most people have premonitory symptoms: a sign of what is ahead. The most famous of these is the &quot;aura&quot;: a collection of visual symptoms that can include blind spots, a difficulty in focusing and flashing lights. Only rarely do I have an aura. Other premonitory symptoms are mood changes (you feel high or, more often, low); lethargy and clumsiness; gut problems such as constipation; a craving for certain, often sweet, foods (this is why many people mistakenly believe their migraine to be triggered by chocolate). My most significant symptom is compulsive yawning; in the hours before my headaches, I yawn every 10 seconds. At Ben Gurion airport, in Tel Aviv, I was yawning about every five seconds. Until very recently, I thought this was unique to me. It seemed so... bizarre. Then I went to interview Siri Hustvedt, the novelist and a fellow migraineur. We talked about our headaches. &quot;Do you get that yawning thing?&quot; she said. A light bulb came on over my head. &quot;Yes. God. I really do.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Me too,&quot; she said. &quot;Isn&apos;t it crazy?&quot;  Most doctors agree that migraine has a genetic component. Does this mean that there is also such a thing as a migraine personality? I looked at Hustvedt, so intense, so clever and so pale, and I wondered. In 1963 a doctor called HG Wolff characterised migraineurs as: ambitious, successful, perfectionistic, rigid, orderly, cautious, emotionally constipated, and driven. Joan Didion writes that while &quot;not all perfectionists have migraine, and not all migrainous people have migraine personalities&quot;, she thought that her own perfectionism - which takes &quot;the form of spending most of a week writing and rewriting and not writing a single paragraph&quot; - might have something to do with it, at least. But the neurologist Oliver Sacks, author of a classic text about migraine, disagrees: &quot;Patients with severe habitual migraine seemed to me to be so various in their emotional pathologies and predicaments that I despaired of putting them in a single category.&quot;  What do I think about this? I think that it would be nice, if a little self-aggrandising, to see myself as belonging to this special group of successful people (and it is certainly true that I am a perfectionist). But I am also wary of connecting pain to personality. It seems too 19th century to me, too madwoman in the attic (two-thirds of migraine cases occur in women). Hustvedt told me that after fighting her migraine for years, she had decided to accept it as a part of her. Perhaps she needed it in some way; maybe it was her body&apos;s way of telling her to stop. And some clinicians agree with this notion, to a degree. &quot;We always make the presumption that because migraine is so unpleasant, it must be doing some harm,&quot; says Dr Anne MacGregor, director of research at the City of London Migraine Clinic. &quot;But you could equally argue that it is protecting the brain from too much stimulation; it&apos;s like a circuit breaker.&quot; But I am unconvinced. I need it like I need a hole in the head. Which is exactly what it feels like, most of the time. I&apos;d far rather blame it on modern life, which is rubbish. Or it is for the migraineur - and this, perhaps, is why the incidence of migraine appears to be on the rise, if not the number of sufferers (those prone to migraine are enduring more attacks, a trend that possibly explains why there are now 600,000 migraine blogs on the internet). Migraine hates routine, and modern life is not exactly conducive to routine. Migraine sufferers must eat regularly, exercise regularly and sleep for the same number of hours every night, getting up at the same time each day (a lie-in can cause havoc for the migraineur, hence the phenomenon of the weekend migraine, when the patient only ever has an attack on Saturdays). Flickering computer screens don&apos;t help either, and on that score things could be about to get worse.  In 2008 the government decreed that incan descent light bulbs would be phased out and replaced by energy-efficient equivalents (compact fluorescent light bulbs). Large retailers no longer sell the old 100 watt bulbs. By January 2010, 60 watt bulbs will have disappeared; by December 2011, 40 watt bulbs will be gone, too. But energy-saving light bulbs can trigger migraine, either as a result of their flickering (the technology they use is similar to that of fluorescent strip lights), or the low intensity of the light they emit. The Migraine Trust has recently submitted research on this area to the Department of Health; it would like migraineurs to be able to use traditional bulbs until the problem with green bulbs is fixed. I can only be anecdotal about this. The other night I went to dinner at a house where all the bulbs were &quot;green&quot;.  I noticed the uncomfortable quality of the light immediately. Twenty-four hours later I had my first migraine in three months. In ancient Greece, Galen attributed migraines to the ascent of humours from the liver to the head. He called the condition hemicrania - a painful disorder affecting half the head - a word that eventually became &quot;megrim&quot; and, finally, migraine. More than 1,800 years later we still don&apos;t precisely understand the causes of migraine - though we are getting closer. According to a recent paper in Scientific American, the condition is now thought to arise from a disorder of the nervous system - and from the most ancient part of that system, the brain stem. Migraineurs&apos; brains are hyperexcitable (this sensitivity may be genetically determined), meaning that they are much more sensitive to stimuli than someone not prone to migraine. During an attack, blood flow to the brain increases by about 300%. This results in cortical-spreading depression, a wave of intense nerve cell activity that spreads through a large swath of the cortex (the outer layer of the brain). This may cause both the aura and the pain. But the science involved is highly complex, and still controversial. Researchers are, however, now testing drugs that specifically inhibit cortical-spreading depression, a move that could ultimately lead to a very significant breakthrough.  In an interview the novelist Zo\u00eb Heller once said that the one thing that would improve her life was a cure for migraine. Will we ever get to that stage? &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever get to the point where we can say: your body is never going to be capable of having a migraine,&quot; says MacGregor. &quot;It would be like saying: your body is never going to be capable of experiencing pain. We think about control rather than cure. The issue is: who is in charge? Is your migraine controlling you, or are you controlling it?&quot; Of course knowing your triggers, and avoiding them, helps a lot - though given that these can include almost everything, from drinking wine to the smell of a certain perfume to your menstrual cycle, this is not always as easy as it sounds. Beyond this, most of us rely on a group of drugs called the triptans, one of which, sumatriptan, can now be bought over the counter in the form of a pill called Imigran. A triptan taken as soon as your headache starts can be very effective, aborting an attack within 30 to 90 minutes. Here&apos;s a thing, though: doctors are not sure how, exactly, they work (they were developed to treat other diseases). Is it just that they constrict the blood vessels in the brain that become swollen during an attack? Perhaps.  The arrival of Imigran in Boots in 2006 was wonderful for me. It is a serious drug, and I try not to take it too often. But knowing that I can get it without the palaver of a doctor&apos;s appointment, and having it in my bag when I am travelling somewhere inhospitable - a place where it would really not be a very good idea for me to lie down in public - is an immense comfort.  I am, though, expert at self-treatment. If I have a hot shower - as hot as I can bear - early on in an attack, I can sometimes send it on its way.  I also know the arc of my migraines well enough now to be able to accommodate them. I know how long they will last. I know that once the vomiting starts, I am almost home and dry; these days, the vomiting almost comes as a relief.  Have I tried the sillier things? Ha. It will not surprise you to know that I&apos;m unconvinced by things like acupuncture: I want drugs, and I want them now! But I do own a few of the barmier bits of headache hardware you can find; I bought them while I was thinking about this piece. The Migra-Cap, which you keep in the fridge and which, once it is on your head, makes you look like an inmate of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, combines cold therapy with darkness and is endorsed by the cricketer Mark Butcher, another sufferer.  But it doesn&apos;t do it for me. Like I say, I need heat. I also have a Rio Light Mask, allegedly trialled by doctors at Hammersmith Hospital, which uses &quot;photic stimulation in the form of programmed patterns of gently pulsating light&quot; to prevent migraine. I have no idea if this works. I used it and I didn&apos;t get a migraine. But then I might not have had one anyway. Also, you&apos;re supposed to wear it at bedtime. It does not exactly - how to put this? - encourage conjugal intimacy.  Anyway, I have outed myself now. Migraineur. Feeble woman. There it is. Except I have always felt that my migraines, and the sensitivities in my brain that they betray, have made me, if not more special, then certainly more strong. Whatever else they&apos;ve done for me in my life, they have turned me into a stoic, a survivor, into someone who can get through. In the middle of an attack, I will tell myself this: You can get through. And, of course, I always do. And the hours afterwards bring their own rewards: the intense happiness that comes with feeling better; the way that the world, seen through convalescent eyes, is so immaculate and finely drawn and full of promise; the way that I&apos;m suddenly so intensely productive; the way that food and drink and - I might as well be honest - Rowntree&apos;s Fruit Pastilles suddenly taste so very good. I await the next generation of drugs impatiently; I&apos;d be lying if I said otherwise. But in the meantime,  I can probably cope - compact fluorescent light bulbs allowing.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-09T23:01:00Z", "title": "Migraine and me: Rachel Cooke on two decades of pain", "sentences": ["At Ben Gurion airport, in Tel Aviv, I was yawning about every five seconds."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/10/migraine"}, {"tags": ["Pope Benedict XVI", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "The papacy", "Shimon Peres"], "article": "      Pope Benedict XVI today pleaded for a just and lasting peace between Israeli and the Palestinians as he arrived in Israel for a five-day visit. The pontiff, who is touring Israel&apos;s national Holocaust memorial and visiting holy sites, made his comments in a brief speech at Tel Aviv airport. &quot;I plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue in the search for a just resolution of the outstanding difficulties so that both peoples may live in peace in a homeland of their own, within secure and internationally recognised borders,&quot; he said. The pope did not use the word &quot;state&quot; \u2013 a status the new Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, opposes despite pressure from the US. However, his reference to two homelands within international borders made it clear he was reaffirming the Vatican&apos;s position in favour of establishing a Palestinian state, putting it at odds with the Israeli government. Netanyahu, who attended the welcoming ceremony, has said talk of a two-state solution is premature and that he favours putting the focus on economic development of the Palestinian territories. The pope said he had come to Jerusalem to pray for peace there and throughout the world.  He said he would honour the 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust and fight anti-semitism wherever it was found. &quot;I will have the opportunity to honour the memory of the six million Jewish victims of the Shoah,&quot; said the pontiff, who faces criticism for the Vatican&apos;s policies toward Jews during the second world war and the recent reinstatement of a bishop who denied the Holocaust. &quot;Anti-semitism continues to rear its ugly head in many parts of the world. This is totally unacceptable. Every effort must be made to combat anti-semitism wherever it is found.&quot; The papal visit will be closely watched by Israelis as well as by Palestinians who want the pope to speak out in favour of an independent state. The 82-year-old pope will meet the rightwing Israeli mayor of the city, Nir Barkat, before holding talks with the Israeli president, Shimon Peres. Later today he will visit Yad Vashem, Israel&apos;s Holocaust memorial. He will take part in a memorial ceremony, give a speech and meet six Holocaust survivors. However, he will not visit the museum at the site, where a brief photo caption is critical of the wartime pope, Pius XII, for failing to speak out against the Holocaust. Some Israelis have openly criticised Benedict. &quot;The message he brings with him as a supreme religious leader, who according to Catholic tradition cannot be wrong, is not one of compassion, understanding, or tolerance,&quot; Nitzan Horowitz, an Israeli MP from the leftwing Meretz party, wrote on the website of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. &quot;In fact, this pope brings a wholly different message \u2013 one of indifference, strictness, and religious radicalism.&quot; In an early sign of how the pope will be unable to avoid the politics of the Middle East conflict, the Israeli president&apos;s office said it had invited the father of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured near Gaza three years ago, to attend Peres&apos;s meeting with the pope. The president&apos;s office said it hoped &quot;his assistance can be a great asset in the struggle to bring Gilad home&quot;. Israel and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas have for months been indirectly and unsuccessfully negotiating a prisoner swap to free Shalit and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. An attempt by the Palestinian Authority to have the pope stand on a stage next to Israel&apos;s concrete West Bank barrier at a refugee camp near Bethlehem appears to have failed. Although the stage has been built, he will instead visit a UN school in the camp after saying mass in Manger Square, Bethlehem, on Wednesday. Benedict has spent three days in Jordan and said he had come to the Middle East &quot;as a pilgrim, to venerate holy places&quot;. He said the Catholic church was not a political but a &quot;spiritual force&quot; and could help with the peace process, and spoke of his &quot;deep respect&quot; for Islam.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-11T10:36:00Z", "title": "Pope in Israel calls for 'just and lasting' Middle East peace", "sentences": ["The pontiff, who is touring Israel&apos;s national Holocaust memorial and visiting holy sites, made his comments in a brief speech at Tel Aviv airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/11/pope-benedict-israel-visit"}, {"tags": ["Pope Benedict XVI", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Israel", "Religion", "Second world war", "World news", "The papacy"], "article": "Pope Benedict XVI was publicly criticised today for not going far enough in his condemnation of the Holocaust, on his arrival in Israel for a week&apos;s pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

Then accompanied by Israel&apos;s chief rabbis he saw the holiest site in Judaism, the Western Wall. He was to have meetings with the chief rabbis before visiting the Cenacle, the apparent site of the Last Supper.

He has dispatched Hillary Clinton to Israel, Egypt and Lebanon, sent his envoys to Syria and hosted Jordan&apos;s King Abdullah in Washington. Now the White House has announced the final move in this opening gambit: Obama&apos;s first visit to the region as president will be a policy speech in Egypt on 4 June. Though next week&apos;s Washington meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu might prove more significant in the evolution of the administration&apos;s Middle East policy, the Egypt address provides the US with a public opportunity to rebuild its damaged reputation and chart a new course in the region. However, by selecting the corrupt and authoritarian regime in Cairo as host, Obama risks undermining his own message of reconciliation and change. Following on from his successful delivery in Ankara, deciding to speak publicly in the combustible Arab Middle East is a courageous and laudable decision by Obama. The White House, in explaining why Egypt was chosen from among the Arab states, claimed it to be the &quot;heart of the Arab world&quot;, being the most populous and, potentially, powerful state in the region. In what is a symbolic departure from the past, Obama will avoid Israel in his first trip to the region. Perhaps he hopes that this, combined with his renewed message of peace, will attract the same crowds and adulation as he received in Berlin during his election campaign. Though selecting a dictatorial state with a poor human rights record as a platform for this speech does leave it open to criticism, the administration insists that the ends justify the means. &quot;The scope of the speech,&quot; insisted White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, &quot;is bigger than where the speech was going to be given or who&apos;s the leadership of the country.&quot; Some could argue that Washington has slim pickings to choose from, given the authoritarian nature of virtually all the Arab regimes, and Obama could even use his address to criticise the heavy-handed Mubarak regime. &quot;The issues of democracy and human rights ... are on the president&apos;s mind,&quot; confirmed Gibbs. Yet such an approach is naive at best. No matter how symbolic or dramatic the text, it will still be seen as Obama&apos;s endorsement of the Mubarak regime. If the White House genuinely believes that the speech&apos;s content outweighs any negativity brought on by the policies of the host country, why not make it in Beirut, Damascus or Riyadh? The answer is that domestic criticism of the president would be far greater if he were to publicly support these governments. Whether it is intended or not, Hosni Mubarak will bask in the US president&apos;s glow. Cairo&apos;s use of the forthcoming trip to try to legitimate the octogenarian&apos;s police state is sadly inevitable. This will prompt fears of Washington opting for pragmatism over principle. At his inauguration, Obama told &quot;those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent&quot; that &quot;we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist&quot;. Yet Mubarak has done no such unclenching. No positive reforms have been made and Egypt remains authoritarian. Even in the short time that Obama has been in office hundreds of people have been held without trial following the Gaza war protests. Perhaps this endorsement is a reward for Egypt&apos;s constant mediation in talks between Hamas and Fatah. Yet this role should not be overstated. The Gaza war demonstrated Cairo&apos;s true colours in the Israel-Palestine conflict and it is highly likely that the success of these negotiations hinges on external events in Washington, Tel Aviv and Damascus. Egypt might be doing a good job of playing babysitter while the real politics is thrashed out elsewhere, but surely that&apos;s the least Washington can ask for the $1.3bn a year it gives in aid. In addition to this, the administration seems to have overlooked or be woefully unaware of the level of Mubarak&apos;s unpopularity outside Egypt, and how it may reflect badly on Obama. The Gaza war saw him criticised and even mocked regularly in the media of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria: the very populations Washington wishes to win over. In contrast, Jordan would seem a more acceptable choice for the speech. While Amman&apos;s concrete blocks might lack the glamour (and pollution) of Cairo, it is geographically closer to the real &quot;heart of the Arab world&quot;, the Israel-Palestine conflict. More importantly, while the regime is far from democratic, it is more benign than in Egypt. Moreover, Obama has already developed links with King Abdullah, a leader who has shown a greater willingness to domestically reform than Mubarak. Pessimists will see the Cairo address as Obama abandoning the ideals set out in his inauguration for the sake of regional stability, while optimists will hope that his miracle-working speech writers can turn the situation around with a delivery true to those principles, over the head of his host. What is certain is that by choosing Cairo, the new president has taken a gamble. No matter how spectacular his rhetoric in June, winning over the Arab and Muslim world will need results on the ground in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan that could take years to achieve. In contrast, public endorsement of the Mubarak dictatorship could discredit him in their eyes far more quickly.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-12T11:00:00Z", "title": "Cairo is the wrong choice for Obama | Chris Phillips", "sentences": ["The Gaza war demonstrated Cairo&apos;s true colours in the Israel-Palestine conflict and it is highly likely that the success of these negotiations hinges on external events in Washington, Tel Aviv and Damascus."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/12/cairo-obama-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Leonard Cohen", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Pink Floyd", "Music", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "Protest", "Gaza", "World news", "Roger Waters"], "article": "&quot;This machine surrounds hate and forces it to surrender,&quot; reads the famous slogan on Pete Seeger&apos;s banjo. The legendary folksinger, who is celebrating his 90th birthday this year, popularised one of the most powerful peace songs ever written: &quot;Last night I had the strangest dream, I&apos;d ever dreamed before. I dreamed the world had all agreed, to put an end to war&quot; \u2013 a song that was played for many years every day on Abie Nathan&apos;s pirate Voice of Peace radio station based &quot;somewhere in the Mediterranean&quot;. Music has frequently accompanied struggles for freedom, equality and peace, like the songs of the Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish civil war, the civil rights movement in the United States, and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. For us in the peace movement, many of these songs have been part of the soundtrack of our lives and struggles. And now a group of academics in the UK \u2013 among them Professor Haim Bresheeth, who spent many years in Israel \u2013 is urging Leonard Cohen to cancel his concert in Israel, scheduled for 24 September, because &quot;your songs have been part of the soundtrack of our lives&quot;. It is not &quot;the right action&quot; according to the Buddhist precepts he identifies with, because it sends a message of support for Israeli military actions against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Well, Leonard Cohen&apos;s music is part of the soundtrack of my life as well, and I think he is doing the right thing performing in Israel this September, and I will add that I have no idea where he stands on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since he usually doesn&apos;t voice his political positions either in his music or otherwise. But there are others who have made their positions very clear. Back in 1978, Joan Baez was invited to appear at an Israeli Woodstock-type festival in the Sinai desert oasis town of Nuweiba. When Israeli peace activists told her that it was in occupied (ie Egyptian) territory, she cancelled her participation. However, she insisted on coming to perform in Israel and Lebanon, to demonstrate her identification with both Israelis and Palestinians. Her visit coincided with one of the first major Israeli-Palestinian dialogues, organised by the Tel Aviv-based peace monthly New Outlook. It later appeared in book form under the title When Enemies Dare to Talk. She used the opportunity to meet the Israeli participants in the dialogue at the Jerusalem home of Yaacov Arnon, the former director general of the finance ministry, and one of the first people to enter into ongoing dialogue with the PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. She also met Palestinians at the home of Professor Nafez Nazzal in Ramallah, and academics at Birzeit University. In 2006 there were calls for Roger Waters, the Pink Floyd leader, not to perform in Israel out of identification with the Palestinians. Waters \u2013 who performed The Wall when the Berlin Wall came down, and will hopefully have an opportunity to perform when the separation wall snaking along and through the West Bank comes down (and it will come down) \u2013 did not listen to those calls. Instead he chose to make a statement against the occupation and for Israeli-Palestinian peace by performing in Israel at the joint Jewish-Arab community Neve Shalom/Wahat al-Salam. And just about a month ago, Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul and Mary) also chose to come to Israel, after the Gaza war, to perform Blowing in the Wind, and to sing with the audience about having a hammer &quot;of justice, of freedom, a song between my brothers and my sisters, all over this world&quot;. Yarrow came, together with the educator Charlotte Frank, to promote a programme called Operation Respect which advocates using music to overcome violence in the schools and developing respect for the other. They wanted to introduce it in both Israel and Palestine, since children are the key to a non-violent, peaceful future. Yarrow told me that he became involved in the quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace after appearing at a Passover peace rally on the streets of New York back in 1989. When he decided to come to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, he consulted with his family, including his daughter, who had gone to struggle against apartheid in South Africa. They all supported his decision. &quot;People here are desperate,&quot; he said. &quot;They need new sources of hope. We must engage young people, and one of the key ways of doing this is via music and art.&quot; And at all of his public appearances during his latest visit, mainly before educators and activists, he made his positions on war and peace, the need to end the occupation, and the need for freedom and peace for both Israelis and Palestinians very clear. When he was unable to perform in the West Bank because of &quot;the situation&quot;, Yarrow insisted on meeting Palestinian journalists in Jerusalem so that he could communicate his message to the Palestinian people. Professor Bresheeth, one of the organisers of the call to Leonard Cohen, was the founder of the cinema studies department at Sapir College, in the Negev near Sderot and Gaza. Last week I went to the Tel Aviv Cinemateque to see a showing of an impressive feature film called 18 Kilometers, directed by student Avi Levi. It tells a very human story \u2013 in both Hebrew and Arabic, with Jewish and Palestinian actors \u2013 about the lives of ordinary people in Gaza and Sderot who live 18km from each other. After the film ended, the current department head, Avner Feingelrant closed the evening by declaring: &quot;May the flame of creativity defeat the fire of war.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-05-14T09:30:00Z", "title": "Singing for peace in Israel | Hillel Schenker", "sentences": ["Her visit coincided with one of the first major Israeli-Palestinian dialogues, organised by the Tel Aviv-based peace monthly New Outlook.", "Last week I went to the Tel Aviv Cinemateque to see a showing of an impressive feature film called 18 Kilometers, directed by student Avi Levi."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/14/leonard-cohen-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Family", "Relationships", "Life and style"], "article": "On television news, Arabs and Jews look as though they&apos;ve been at each other&apos;s throats for ever. Fortunately, there are people around us with longer memories - people who, by the arc of their own lives, prove that this wasn&apos;t always the case.  People such as my parents: Iraqi Jews who migrated to Israel in the early 1950s and to England during the 1970s. My family, just like thousands of other Jewish families, had been at home in Middle Eastern countries for centuries; Jews neighbouring Arabs, co-nationalists living for the most part cordially and in peace. It seemed easy, instinctive and eternal - until it all fell apart.  Recently, I went back to Israel, where I was born, to research the stories of these Jews from Arab countries and find out what happened to them in the Jewish state. I wanted to bring their experiences back into the frame. In the process, I brought my parents, and my own family history, into much sharper focus, too.  If there was a defining moment, it came in a scruffy trade union building in Tel Aviv. A group of Israeli musicians gathers here in a boxy room each week - classically trained performers of a vintage that was adored in their country of birth, Iraq, but whose musical style did not quite fit the tastes of the Jewish state. It&apos;s sort of an all Iraqi-Jewish jam session, although they play a lot of Egyptian classics and the percussionists tap out oriental rhythms on darbukas, tambourines or tabletops. As I sat among them, it dawned on me that my mother - forever clapping an alien-sounding, misfit beat over western music while I was growing up in England - was simply marking out a rhythm that I couldn&apos;t hear. Her clapping retroactively became normal.  By the time my family moved to England, my father had lived in Turkey and France as a student, as well as Iraq and Israel - and had a fair idea of the social values he rated in a country. England ticked the right boxes. My mother had some reservations: wouldn&apos;t it be tough to raise children so far from a sprawling, close-knit family in Israel, whose love and support were surely more important than abstract ideals?  Those reservations about being far from &quot;home&quot; (I was never sure which one - Iraq or Israel) were sometimes nudged by the sort of migrant experiences that were typical of British life in the 1970s. Back then, Britain wasn&apos;t especially interested in my parents being Iraqi, or Israeli, or whatever. Perhaps they were just &quot;foreign&quot; - at any rate, that was how I tended to perceive them as a child. There were long trips in search of pitta bread and long waits for visiting relatives to bring us bottles of amba, the radioactively bright mango pickle that Iraqis seem addicted to. My mum admits that she would go to a pet-food shop for the unhusked sunflower seeds that she&apos;d roast for us to crack open between our teeth as a snack. (&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right, for the budgie,&quot; she&apos;d tell the shopkeeper.)  I didn&apos;t realise then that the seed-cracking was a hallmark oriental habit - or that, in early Israel, public transport operators were so confounded by the carpets of seed husks that lined the buses, courtesy of passengers, that they erected signs to discourage the practice. When I was young, I didn&apos;t know the pet-shop story, either. Had my mum told me then, I&apos;d have been embarrassed, as I was by all things that made me appear &quot;foreign&quot;. A migrant kid, I assumed that blanding out my background would somehow make me more British, whereas all it could possibly achieve was to make me more bland.  I grew up with Arabic (or Judaeo-Arabic) cuisine: Iraqi breakfasts on Saturdays of overnight-boiled eggs, fried eggplants, mango pickle and salad stuffed into pitta pockets; ba&apos;ba beh tamur, homemade date pastries that would surface around the Jewish festival of Purim; slow-cooked marrows that had been carefully emptied and restuffed with fragrant rice, meat and pine nuts; falafels and hummus in my lunchbox. The Arabic language was ever present - because my parents were always speaking it, or quoting parables or bits of poetry in it, or reading Jewish religious texts in Arabic over the Passover table. Arabic music was always in the background at home, either via treasured, battered cassettes or on crackly long-wave. There was never any doubt that Arab culture was an integral part of our Jewish home: respected, enjoyed and admired. But growing up, I wasn&apos;t really into it.  As it turns out, scores of Israeli children were experiencing something similar at that time. Approximately half the population of Israel is from Arab or Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen. Known as Mizrahi (&quot;Eastern&quot;) or Sephardi Jews, they arrived in Israel during various periods following its creation in 1948. Jews of Mizrahi origin were for many years the majority in Israel - until the arrival of just under a million migrants from the former Soviet bloc during the early 1990s reshuffled the ethnic pack. Mizrahis grew up in a Jewish society that was desperate to yoke to Europe and belittled the Arab world as an uncivilised cultural desert. The majority Mizrahis were assumed by the ruling European minority to be bearers of an inferior culture that should not come to represent or define the Jewish state. And, inevitably, many of those Mizrahi children internalised this story.  Interviewing for my book, it was easy to understand the Mizrahis who described how they had spent childhoods faking their own identities - in a country that encouraged its Mizrahi population to ditch those &quot;backward&quot; oriental habits. One professor told me he&apos;d badgered his father into changing the family surname to something that wasn&apos;t a telltale mark of Mizrahi origin, and now feels shame each time he visits his father&apos;s grave and sees the bogus name on the headstone. Another, of Moroccan origin, described how she invented a French persona for herself, forbidding her parents from speaking Arabic or playing oriental music. Others described how they erased their guttural oriental accent: vocals that are integral to Hebrew - a Semitic language, the sister of Arabic, but which Israel decided would be tonally &quot;wrong&quot; for the Jewish state. (I remember how I used to practise my English vowels until they lost the slightest foreign twang.) And these stories repeat so many times over in Israel - recollections of masked origins, buried roots, trashed biographies; blanded-out backgrounds.  This wasn&apos;t uniformly the case. Countless Mizrahis retained their home culture in Israel, often in defiance and against the odds. When their Europeanised co-nationalists pronounced Mizrahi culture to be inferior, some just said: &quot;And who are you, exactly, to decide on that?&quot; Meanwhile, many of those Mizrahis who did sever roots are now trying to reconnect with those forsaken origins - reclaiming their real family names, reinstating the oriental vocals, rediscovering their home culture. Yair Dalal, a world-acclaimed Israeli musician of Iraqi origin, describes a realignment process that occurs when he sends his Mizrahi students home to practise a piece of oriental music. &quot;They come back a week later and say: &apos;My dad started to sing the song I was playing.&apos; And that&apos;s the connection. That person is back on track.&quot;  Getting back on track means that - to my good fortune - I now appreciate more fully my parents&apos; Iraqi dimension. I&apos;m aware of the irony: that researching a book on how Israel patronised its Mizrahi citizens made me realise how I&apos;d patronised my Mizrahi parents. But, as my good-natured parents might say in Iraqi Arabic: &quot;Ahsan min maku.&quot; (Better than nothing.)  They remain dedicated followers of Iraqi and other Arabic culture in the UK. They shop for favourite foods at Iraqi grocers, chronicling the storekeeper&apos;s arrival in England, lamenting the tragedy of Iraq and raising colourful Arabic curses to the foolish western interference in that country. They remain forlorn at the closure of London&apos;s Kufa gallery, an Iraqi cultural centre that shut down a few years after the second Gulf war. They loved the British Museum&apos;s recent Babylon exhibition and attended many of the related events.  My parents remain absorbed in the small print of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the wider region. They&apos;re connected to and care about Israel - it was home - but still it bugs them, politically and culturally: &quot;Why don&apos;t they pronounce this word properly, as it is written in Hebrew?&quot;; &quot;Why can&apos;t they spell Arabic street signs correctly?&quot;; &quot;Why, in the name of God, do they care so little about the Middle East?&quot;  Happy Englanders, they are equally invested in and committed to British politics and culture - they won&apos;t miss Question Time; they are friends of the Opera House; they are as likely to bemoan politically spineless New Labour policy as they are morally bankrupt Israeli policy. They span these worlds effortlessly, showing how easy it can be to bridge binaries, how seemingly polar opposites - Arab or Jew, east or west - can reside together comfortably in the same space, the same skin.  \u2022 Not the Enemy: Israel&apos;s Jews from Arab Lands by Rachel Shabi (Yale University Press, \u00a318.99).

Leave five minutes for the pleasantries, 30 seconds for the coffee to be poured, and 84 and a half minutes will remain to kick-start what is perhaps the most ambitious bid to bring peace to the Middle East for nearly a decade. Once again, true to his campaign motto of &quot;Yes we can&quot;, Obama is boldly plunging in where others fear to tread. May will see an extraordinary series of meetings for the new president: Netanyahu will be followed to the White House by President Mubarak of Egypt and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority. Other regional allies will be consulted, envoys dispatched, world leaders called and cajoled. And then, in the first week of June, Obama will fly to Egypt, where he will deliver a historic speech aimed not just at outlining his own strategy for bringing peace to the Middle East, but also at reframing America&apos;s entire relationship with the Muslim world, so damaged during recent years. The contrast with his predecessors could hardly be greater. President Bush was committed to isolating Iran while fighting in Iraq, and gave almost unconditional support to Israel; Obama has elected to engage with Iran, is withdrawing from Iraq, and has signalled a very different approach to Israel. After the radical change that Bush sought in the Middle East comes a new bid to alter the political map of one of the world&apos;s most dangerous and critical strategic zones. There is a sense of urgency and commitment - and an equal desire to avoid getting bogged down. According to Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Washington is looking for &quot;real results&quot;. David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, returned to London from talks with Hillary Clinton, his American counterpart, saying that the administration was &quot;throwing itself into the peace process&quot;. Obama is reported to have plunged into an in-depth study of the history and geography of the issue, reading up on key issues such as Jewish settlements, the Golan Heights, the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the security threat to Israel. Tony Blair, the Middle East envoy for the &quot;quartet&quot; of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, is convinced that something important is about to happen; he told the US Senate foreign affairs committee last week that Obama can &quot;reinvigorate the credibility of the road to peace&quot; as he stood in front of a map pointing a laser pen at strategic locations in the territories occupied by Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, which could feature in negotiations. Though Blair described himself as &quot;optimistic&quot;, few doubt that the obstacles remain enormous. Chief among them may be the president&apos;s ability to devote the attention necessary to the impossibly complicated issues. Obama and his team are already fighting a host of foreign policy fires bequeathed them by the Bush administration - in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq - while wrestling with massive economic problems. &quot;Obama is fighting on a huge number of fronts and the extent to which he can actually deliver on them has got to be doubtful,&quot; said Nicholas Pelham, the Jordan-based Middle East expert for the International Crisis Group thinktank. And though the departure of Bush was greeted with a regional sigh of relief, Obama&apos;s charm and presence may not be as effective in the hard-bitten world of the Middle East as elsewhere. &quot;Certainly goodwill and charisma will take him some distance but not far, especially not in the Middle East. I think any honeymoon he had is over,&quot; said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a specialist at the conservative Foundation for Defence of Democracies in Washington. On the ground, there is deep scepticism. For Efraim Inbar, professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, &quot;American foreign policy has always been characterised by sudden bursts of optimism and naivety&quot;, and few predict a breakthrough. First, there is massive &quot;negotiation fatigue&quot;; local populations are now &quot;allergic to so-called peace processes&quot;, in the words of one local analyst with long experience of brokering agreements between hostile parties. Secondly, the Palestinians are split between the relative moderates of the West Bank and the extremists of Hamas, the Islamist armed organisation in the Gaza Strip, so a united response to any putative Israeli negotiating offer is unlikely. The violence of the war fought in Gaza earlier this year by the Israelis in a bid to stop missile attacks by Hamas militants has further embittered an atmosphere already poisoned by years of violence and further polarised the region. The rockets fired into Israel caused deaths, shock and anger. Hamas is still committed by its charter to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the popularity of Abbas, the key moderate interlocutor on the Palestinian side for Obama, is waning. And everywhere economic hardship and a sense of humiliation are as deep as ever. &quot;The situation on the ground is not very conducive to progress currently,&quot; admitted Tamara Cofman Wittes of Washington&apos;s Brookings Institution thinktank. &quot;On both sides there are very weak leaders and a breakdown of trust. The Palestinians cannot offer the Israelis anything at the moment.&quot; Nor is there much sign that the Israelis are keen to be offered much. &quot;There is great scepticism about the Palestinians being able to reach any agreement and implement it,&quot; said Inbar at Tel Aviv. Though centrists actually won recent elections, it was Netanyahu, known for his tough stance on security issues, who was able to form a government in Israel with a solid bloc of right-wing support in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. Netanyahu, who appointed a prominent nationalist as a foreign minister, has not once spoken of an independent Palestinian state since taking power, despite this being the basis of almost all peace negotiations for years. Instead, he insists that Iran and its nuclear ambitions are by far the most pressing regional issue and should be the focus of efforts for now. He suggested to Egypt&apos;s Mubarak and to Jordan&apos;s King Abdullah in meetings last week that the best thing would be more investment in the Palestinian economy and more training for the Palestinian security forces to reduce extremism and violence. This will almost certainly be the same message he delivers when he sees Obama. &quot;You have a series of blockages that will keep the status quo. The realities of the Middle East will impose themselves as they always do,&quot; said Dr Toby Dodge, Middle East expert at Queen Mary College, the University of London. The shape of Obama&apos;s ambitious new plan is now becoming clear. First, after years of strong support from the US, Israel - the largest single beneficiary of American overseas aid - now appears likely to come under much greater pressure to make crucial concessions. And last night, Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak said he believes Netanyahu will endorse the creation of a Palestinian state during his upcoming meeting with Obama in Washington. The Bush administration was solidly behind Israel. Obama&apos;s position is more ambiguous. In his home town, Chicago, before running for the presidency, he made comments sympathetic to the Palestinians but later adopted a more pro-Israeli line. Secretary of state Clinton, as senator for New York, was regarded by contrast as a solid supporter of Israel, but in recent weeks has been critical of Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank. America last week voted for a UN Security Council statement drafted by Russia that reaffirmed the backing of the international community for a formula that would see a &quot;two-state solution&quot; - that is, an independent Palestinian state established on land under Israeli military occupation for 42 years. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, indicated that the US wanted to reinvigorate proceedings of the quartet group as another means of moving forward. US officials have even mentioned that they would like to see Israel sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which would put it under pressure to declare and give up its nuclear arsenal - unthinkable a year ago - and have moved to open space for a possible deal with a Palestinian government that might include the extremists of Hamas. &quot;Prepare yourself for change,&quot; the veteran Israeli journalist Eitan Haber last week counselled Netanyahu, who had a fiery relationship with President Clinton while he was prime minister in the late 1990s. &quot;This is not the America you used to know.&quot; At the very least, the new tone of the US administration has sparked broad political debate in Israel. On Thursday night, dozens of right-wing Jewish settlers gathered on congested Aza Street in Jerusalem outside Netanyahu&apos;s heavily guarded home. With placards and speeches they challenged the new prime minister not to give an inch when he sees Obama tomorrow. &quot;You don&apos;t have a mandate for concessions,&quot; read one of the boards in Hebrew. But the next morning, the Israeli peace group Gush Shalom placed one of its weekly advertisements in the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper reading simply: &quot;The real Israeli patriots are hoping - if not praying - that president Obama will influence prime minister Netanyahu, and not the other way around.&quot; In America, powerful lobby groups representing Israeli interests appear resigned to a change in US policy. Earlier this month, at the annual meeting in Washington of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the vice-president, Joe Biden, reflected the new approach of the administration when he called for a freeze of Jewish settlements on the West Bank, prefacing his remarks with: &quot;You won&apos;t like this.&quot; But Aipac is adaptable: after eight years in which it was in tune with Bush and his vice-president, Dick Cheney, it voted in Lee Rosenberg, a Chicago businessman close to Obama, as its president-elect. The real strength of Obama&apos;s strategy lies in the regional dimension. His team is following the dictum &quot;If you can&apos;t solve a problem, make it bigger&quot;. Their aim is to dilute the knotty intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute in a broader environment, in the hope that regional powers such as Jordan and Egypt can offer Israel incentives that the weakened Palestinians cannot or will not give. By linking all the various elements of the complex matrix of conflicts and rivalries that comprise Middle Eastern politics, the White House hopes to get something, somewhere, to give. Some of those blocks might be clearing. Moderate Arab states such as Jordan and Egypt, as well as US allies like Saudi Arabia, are concerned both by the continuing threat of radical Islamic violence and by Iran&apos;s bid for regional primacy and may be prepared to make concessions themselves or press the Palestinians to do so. Last week King Abdullah refloated the idea of Arab and Islamic states recognising Israel in return for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. &quot;The Arab peace initiative has offered Israel a place in the neighbourhood and more - acceptance by 57 nations, the one third of the UN members that do not recognise Israel,&quot; King Abdullah told a World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan. &quot;This is true security - security that barriers and armed forces cannot bring, inaction is not an option.&quot; This month&apos;s push will climax when Obama delivers his speech in Egypt, outlining his strategy while simultaneously restarting US relations with the Islamic world. Time, however, is short. Mark Fitzpatrick, nuclear specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, says the Iranians could be, in a worst-case scenario, 12 to 18 months from building a nuclear weapon. According to King Abdullah, failure to find a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians would lead to war within the same period. Tomorrow&apos;s meeting with Netanyahu is only the first step on a long, hard road.   The key players  Binyamin Netanyahu Israel&apos;s new right-wing prime minister believes the Palestinians are not ready for a state that would allow Israel to live in security without attacks from militant groups such as Hamas. Instead, he wants to focus on economic development and more training for the Palestinian security forces. He sees Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions as a far more pressing issue for the region. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Iran&apos;s president, who faces an election next month against two reformist candidates, supports the Palestinians, and is often accused of funding and arming the Islamist movement Hamas. He is a bitter opponent of Israel. He wants to maintain Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, against the mounting concerns of Israel and the West. Bashir Al-Assad Syria&apos;s president for the past nine years wants re-engagement with the West and a peace deal with Israel that would see the return to Syria of all the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and later annexed. Indirect talks were mediated by Turkey last year but broke off when Israel launched its war in Gaza. Honsi Mubarak Egypt&apos;s president for the past 28 years supports the Palestinian goal of an independent state. He wants Egypt to maintain its role as the key player in the Arab world and his government has been trying to broker a new truce and prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and a reconciliation between the rival Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah. Mahmoud Abbas The president of the Palestinian Authority wants to negotiate a full peace agreement with Israel that would create a viable, independent Palestinian state along the pre-1967 war borders with a capital in east Jerusalem and an agreed solution to the question of Palestinian refugees. He is under pressure from those Palestinians who complain that peace talks, which began in 1991, have failed to achieve full statehood. The key issues Syria and the Golan Heights The Golan Heights are an area of disputed sovereignty wrested from Syrian control by Israel in 1967, which then annexed the 700 square miles of territory in 1981. Syria has insisted ever since on the return of the land and the UN backs its claim. Although previous Israeli governments came close to negotiating the return of the land, Netanyahu has said that Israel will keep the Golan Heights forever, saying that giving them back would mean giving Syria&apos;s ally, Iran, a route into Israel. Refugees&apos; right of return The right of return of Palestinians forced to flee their homes was acknowledged in a UN resolution in 1948 and the principle has been enshrined in international law. The government of Israel says allowing Palestinian refugees back to their former homes in Israel cannot be a right, but has to be treated as a political demand to be resolved as part of a peace settlement. It would also like to restrict the right to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. Around 3.7 million Palestinians live in refugee camps in the Middle East. The role of Hamas Founded in 1987 to fight for an Islamic Palestinian state, Hamas shot to political success in 2006 when it won a landslide victory in the Palestinians&apos; first democratic parliamentary elections, wresting control from the ruling and fractured Fatah party. Hamas&apos;s original charter is committed to replacement of Israel by an Israeli Palestinian state.  The recent invasion of the Gaza Strip was in part prompted by Hamas firing rockets into Israel, in response to the economic blockade of the Strip by Israel that began in 2007. Hamas emerged intact from the Israeli onslaught and its popularity will be a crucial factor in any new peace process. Its military wing is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK and the EU.  Israeli settlements One of the most contentious issues of the conflict is the fate of the communities of Jewish settlers who have moved on to disputed territories or land owned by Palestinians and built homes, citing a biblical right to be there. The settlements have existed and expanded since the 1967 Six Day War, when they were backed as strategically important. Israeli governments have both actively encouraged the settlements and also, during the Gaza withdrawal in 2005, removed people by force. The Palestinians believe settlements are a barrier to peace and the UN security council, the EU and the International Court of Justice have said that they violate international law.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-16T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obama makes his bid for Middle East peace", "sentences": ["For Efraim Inbar, professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, &quot;American foreign policy has always been characterised by sudden bursts of optimism and naivety&quot;, and few predict a breakthrough.", "&quot;There is great scepticism about the Palestinians being able to reach any agreement and implement it,&quot; said Inbar at Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/17/obama-israel-egypt-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Tony Blair", "Politics", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Tony Blair last night received the $1m Dan David prize for leadership at a ceremony at Tel Aviv university, a prize awarded for &quot;achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on our world.&quot; Blair&apos;s office said 90% of the money from the prize \u2013 which is named after the international businessman and philanthropist Dan David \u2013 would be donated to the Tony Blair faith foundation that promotes religious understanding, by bringing together young people of different faiths across the world to learn directly with, from and about each other. The other 10% of the prize money was donated to the university. The former prime minister has been envoy to the Quartet of the EU, the US, Russia and the UN, for the past two years, putting him at the heart of negotiations over one of the world&apos;s most intractable conflicts. One of the flagship causes he has championed can be found on the northern edge of the Palestinian city of Jenin, on the occupied West Bank. The rest of the prize money will be donated to the university.  It has a large stretch of uninspiring land with a handful of disused warehouses. But this is supposed to become an major new industrial park, an international investment worth millions of dollars and designed to forge peace. Blair has been acting as intermediary between the Palestinians and Israelis to try and push the project forwards. Speaking ahead of last night&apos;s ceremony, Qadoura Mousa, the Palestinian governor of Jenin, said Blair had made some progress in his role as envoy but the deadlock in the peace process was hugely damaging to attempts to boost the Palestinian economy. Mousa is proud of how much the area has improved in recent months. He has hosted Blair and others, including the then US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice last year, and says the park could be a model for other projects. But he is also deeply concerned that improved security and economic investment will come to nothing without progress on the political front: the removal of checkpoints, the freezing of Israeli settlement construction and serious talks on a future Palestinian state. &quot;Society cannot settle only with security or economic changes. It also needs a political angle,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;These checkpoints, this constant talk of excessive security, this makes us think that there is no Israeli partner for peace.&quot; Over the two years he has spent as Middle East envoy, Blair&apos;s optimism about the chance of bringing peace has run up against the old, familiar challenges of Middle East peacemaking. Shortly after taking the job he spoke of a &quot;moment of opportunity.&quot; Since then peace talks have restarted and then halted, a new right-wing government has come into power in Israel while Palestinian factions have deepened their divisions, and the conflict has claimed hundreds more lives. The Jenin industrial park is typical. Work has been delayed, but construction should start next year. Security in Jenin, once a city under the sway of the Palestinian militant groups, has improved remarkably. If it is completed the park will provide jobs for 15,000 Palestinians, making a welcome dent in the mounting unemployment levels. The Jenin industrial project first began as far back as 1995 in better economic times when it was easier for Israeli customers to visit Jenin and there was the prospect of an imminent peace agreement. It was dropped after the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising, broke out, and was only revived two years ago. Today the Jenin economy is still far weaker than a decade ago, with thousands of new graduates heading straight into unemployment. &quot;We don&apos;t struggle to improve our economy. We struggle for our freedom and independence,&quot; said Mousa. Similar obstacles have held back Blair&apos;s other projects, although he has made progress in securing an important new mobile telephone frequency for the Palestinians. &quot;The challenges are self-evident; the opportunities for peace less so,&quot; Blair told the US Senate foreign relations committee last week. &quot;The opportunity is there.

SJ Ferdinand forgets drug test \u2013 Manchester, 2004 It was the most expensive shopping trip imaginable: in January 2004, in the prime of his career, Rio Ferdinand was banned for eight months after an incident the previous September in which he forgot he was due for a random drug test after training and instead went shopping. His club, Manchester United, described the FA ruling as &quot;savage and unprecedented&quot;, but an appeal was rejected and Ferdinand missed Euro 2004 as a result. It seems fair to assume that he will never look at a Louis Vuitton manbag in quite the same way again. RS Ferguson&apos;s substandard homework \u2013 Manchester, 2002 It is the day before Manchester United play Maccabi Haifa in the Champions League and Sir Alex Ferguson has clearly done his homework. &quot;We&apos;ve watched all their videos and we know Israeli football has improved a lot over the years,&quot; he tells a roomful of Israeli journalists. &quot;They have already beaten Lokomotiv Moscow, Parma and AC Milan, so we know we can&apos;t underestimate them.&quot; Awkward silence. Israeli TV reporter: &quot;I&apos;m sorry but I think you&apos;re talking about the wrong club.&quot; Ferguson: &quot;They&apos;ve made changes?&quot; Reporter: &quot;No, you are telling us about Hapoel Tel Aviv.&quot; Really long awkward silence. Ferguson (going red): &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I must have got it wrong.&quot; DT Fry squirts a bit out \u2013 St Andrews, 1980s Birmingham City have long considered themselves cursed. In the 1980s club officials attempted to rid themselves of the problems of being a bit rubbish by bringing in a priest and painting crosses on the dressing room doors and the players&apos; boots. Later Blues manager Barry Fry was told the best way to lift the malediction was to walk around the pitch and urinate at each corner. He duly performed the ceremony. &quot;It is pretty difficult to squirt a bit out, walk 60 yards and do it again,&quot; he recalled later, &quot;And it didn&apos;t work. I got the sack.&quot; HP Gaddafi the Libyan libero \u2013 Italy, 2003-07 Serie A is home to some of the best defenders in the world, so if you were looking for a striker to make his mark there, one with a dubious record of three goals in 73 appearances for Libya&apos;s Al Ahly Sporting Club would hardly be top of the list. But if you&apos;re Al-Saadi Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, exceptions can be made. First he was signed by Perugia in 2003 at the sprightly age of 30, where he made one appearance in two years before failing a drugs test. Champions League qualifiers Udinese then snapped him up and gave him a 10-minute run-out during his year&apos;s stay there, before he moved to Sampdoria aged 33 and retired shortly after before fans ever had the chance to see the &quot;striker&quot; display his talents. Oh, to have friends in high places. GR The goldfish that swam the wrong way \u2013 Fulham, 2005 Fulham&apos;s squad in 2005 was not so much lazy as helpless. Four years ago, Fulham&apos;s &quot;player liaison officer&quot; Mark Maunders gave an insight into what&apos;s involved in caring for a squad. &quot;I take care of them so their minds are focused on football and not on things like the boiler not working at home.&quot; For example? &quot;Alain Goma once rang me sounding very troubled. &apos;Mark, Mark, I&apos;ve got a big problem&apos;. So I rushed straight over, and there he was, pointing at a fish bowl. &apos;You&apos;ve got to help me,&apos; he says, &apos;it&apos;s my goldfish - they&apos;re swimming in the wrong direction&apos;&quot;. Also in need of help: Fabrice Fernandes, who phoned to complain his head was getting wet at night. &quot;When I got to his bedroom, a window above his pillow was wide open. It&apos;s fair to say he wasn&apos;t the brightest spark.&quot; DH Gascoigne&apos;s spaghetti rescue \u2013 Rome, 1992-95 Feeling homesick in Rome during another of the long injury lay-offs that peppered his time at Lazio, Paul Gascoigne asked his father, John, to visit him and bring with him a hamper of all his favourite foods. Gascoigne Jr was delighted to welcome his dad to his villa and, half expecting to gorge on Mars bars, flung open the basket in keen anticipation only to find that his father had taken him at his word and couriered packets of dried pasta to the Italian capital. RB Gullit runs out of luck \u2013 Chester-le-Street, 1999 In 1999 Ruud Gullit led Newcastle United to the FA Cup final and defeat by Manchester United. In the course of that season&apos;s cup run, the public relations firm then charged with promoting the competition aimed to stimulate interest by taking the trophy to clubs around the country. At that time Newcastle shared training facilities with Durham County Cricket Club at the Riverside in Chester-Le-Street, where security was pleasantly relaxed. One day, a PR man known as &quot;the keeper of the cup&quot; turned up and was ushered into the football team&apos;s inner sanctum. Shortly afterwards the Dutch manager arrived and, within minutes, raised voices became audible and the keeper of the cup was seen being pursued down a flight of steps and out of the main door by the former world footballer of the year. As that startled PR bundled the cup into his car boot and drove away with enthusiasm, Gullit&apos;s promptly told astonished bystanders that seeing, and even worse, touching the hallowed trophy before winning it could only spell &quot;bad luck.&quot; That explains why his team flopped in the final then. LT Haffey&apos;s nine-goal horror show \u2013 Wembley, 1961 A late withdrawal by Tottenham&apos;s double-winning goalkeeper Bill Brown gave Celtic&apos;s Frank Haffey the chance to make his mark for Scotland against England at Wembley in 1961. Haffey made a mark alright - but not in the way he&apos;d have liked. England were three up by half time, and though the Scots quickly pulled it back to 3-2, Haffey then forgot how to catch the ball, as Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and Johnny Haynes shared six goals between them. Legend has it that, after Scotland&apos;s biggest-ever defeat, Haffey was found singing in the bath. &quot;What&apos;s the time? Nine past Haffey!&quot; became a standard joke - though Celtic fans weren&apos;t laughing a year later when another giant cock-up handed the title to Dundee. SM Harford short of smiles \u2013 Luton, 1990 Luton Town manager Ray Harford had the dubious honour of being the first British league manager to be sacked in the 1990s. It is doubtful the decade saw a more ridiculous decision, chairman Brian Cole announcing that Harford was a &quot;dour character&quot; who lacked the &quot;charisma or ability to relate to the fans in the right way&quot;. Shorthand, so club moles had it, for &quot;he doesn&apos;t smile enough&quot;. Harford had previously led the club to their first, and, as yet, only major trophy, winning the 1988 League Cup final in a famous 3-2 win over Arsenal. He would also have the last laugh: he had only signed a new two-year contract weeks earlier, and left the club with a healthy bulge in his wallet. Five years later he helped Kenny Dalglish and Blackburn to the Premier League title. SM Hill sends deputy on sacking errand \u2013 Fulham, 1994 March 26 1994 - Fulham sack Don Mackay at half-time during their 2-2 draw with Leyton Orient. Jimmy Hill was the chairman, though Mackay has said: &quot;He didn&apos;t have the guts to sack me, so he sent his vice-chairman around instead.&quot; SM Keane not so keen \u2013 Sunderland, 2008 As a player Roy Keane bristled with dynamism, but during the final months of his reign as Sunderland manager he became increasingly inert. He rarely summoned the energy to talk to chairman Niall Quinn. Growing a beard, as he did at the time, might have been a fashion statement, or simply the result of an attack of teenage-style can&apos;t-be-arsedness when confronted by a razor. Eventually Keane informed the club of his resignation by text. Taciturn, enigmatic and uncompromising, or plain bone-idle? You decide.

The Israeli government will certainly challenge the Obama administration on this issue, as Israel is not likely to \u00adco-operate, to put it mildly, with the state department&apos;s new logical, fair-minded approach to non-proliferation. It was none other than Avigdor \u00adLieberman, the Israeli foreign minister, who declared \u2013 with a quite a bit of \u00adchutzpah \u2013 that the US government would adopt whatever policy Israel dictated. But Israelis should realise that the American president cannot be reduced to a puppet of the Israeli government. Bearing in mind the possibility of an Israeli attack against Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, it is critical that the US pursue a robust non-proliferation policy, and demand that all countries in the region sign and implement the NPT. This is the only way to prevent another war in the Middle East. When Israeli leaders talk about halting the Iranian nuclear programme, it is a barely concealed threat of a military strike. Just last month, the Israeli newspaper Ha&apos;aretz published an article by its senior commentator for military affairs calling for Israeli military action against the Iranian nuclear project. When the most liberal daily paper publishes such an article, alarm bells should start ringing. Israel pushed the Middle East into a race for weapons of mass destruction. In 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, the nuclear whistleblower, exposed the frantic bomb-making activity going on behind the walls of the Israeli nuclear facility in Dimona. Experts on nuclear proliferation estimate that Israel is armed with hundreds of atom and hydrogen bombs. Adding to this the biological and chemical weapons that Israel produces in the Nes Ziona biological institute, a frightening picture emerges: a state that is a powder keg of atomic, \u00adbiological and chemical WMD. Today we know that Israel developed nuclear arms while deceiving the US government. President Kennedy was opposed to Israel acquiring or developing nuclear weapons because of the dangers to regional and global stability. But Israel successfully deceived the American inspectors sent to monitor the Dimona reactor. An Israeli attack on Iran would be likely to produce catastrophic consequences, resulting in long-term escalation of violence between the two countries. Other nations and proxies could take sides leading, potentially, to a nuclear confrontation. But hostilities between Israel and Iran would not remain a regional war; they would probably have profound global consequences and cause serious damage to the US. Barack Obama, however, can assume a \u00adhistoric leadership role and prevent this doomsday scenario. He was elected as the harbinger of a new era of rapprochement between hostile nations. To achieve these goals, the American administration needs to rein in Israel, compel it to accept a regime of nuclear disarmament in our region and oblige it to open all nuclear, biological and chemical facilities and missile sites to international inspection. The same holds true for Iran and the other states in the Middle East. The US and Israel are allies \u2013 a mantra repeated by virtually all American politicians, but not carefully analysed. There is a &quot;special relationship&quot;, though not in the conventional meaning of the term as used by Aipac (the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee): the US finances and arms Israel, and the latter is the (sometimes) grateful recipient of American beneficence. Without US support, Israel would be reduced to a minor power. It would be unable to finance the occupation, the settlements in the West Bank and, of course, its nuclear arsenal. Using this leverage, the Obama administration can and should impose on Israel a policy of nuclear disarmament. In a volatile region like ours, in which Jews and Muslims claim a direct link with the Almighty and even purport to speak in His name, the existence of nuclear weapons is a grave threat to world peace. This is particularly true with regard to Israel and Iran, where elements in each country believe in Armageddon as a prelude to redemption. Some of these religious fundamentalists even serve in key governmental positions. This is why the Obama administration must enforce a non-proliferation policy in the Middle East with both Israel and Iran, thus preventing the disastrous consequences of a nuclear conflagration.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-22T08:00:00Z", "title": "US must rein in Israel's nuclear arms | Gideon Spiro", "sentences": ["The surprise announcement by Rose Gottemoeller, a US assistant secretary of state, that America would like every nation \u2013 including Israel \u2013 to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) has sent shockwaves through Tel Aviv, confirming the fears (or hopes, depending on who you ask) that the Obama administration is initiating a major overhaul of its policy on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/22/nuclear-arms-israel-iran-obama"}, {"tags": ["Advertising", "Advertising Standards Authority", "Media", "Israel", "London", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "The Israel Government Tourism Office is withdrawing a series of posters displayed in London Underground stations featuring a map that treats the occupied territories as part of Israel, after the advertisements were referred to the Advertising Standards Authority. The yellow map makes no distinction between Israel and the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and Jews for Justice for Palestinians both complained to the ASA as well as to CBS Outdoor, which is responsible for the poster sites, and Transport for London (TfL), which said it received more than 600 complaints. The poster, which had gone up on 108 sites and was due to go up on another 42 before it was pulled by IGTO, was part of the Think Israel campaign. Last year the ASA upheld a complaint about a magazine advertisement that was part of the same campaign because it implied that Qumran was in the state of Israel when in fact it is in the occupied West Bank. In its judgement, the ASA ruled that the advert should be withdrawn and said it was &quot;concerned by ThinkIsrael.coms [sic] lack of response and apparent disregard for the [committee of advertising practice] code&quot;. An ASA spokesman said it had received 342 complaints about the London Underground posters and it was currently assessing whether there were grounds for an investigation. He said the fact that the posters were being withdrawn would be taken into consideration but did not preclude an investigation. A TfL spokesman said: &quot;The Israel Ministry of Tourism has requested the removal of an advert that they had placed at selected stations on the Tube network.&quot; Neither the Israeli embassy in London or IGTO responded to theguardian.com requests for a comment.

On that occasion, BMI blamed the previous owner of the planes for bowing to Arab sensitivities. &quot;It&apos;s absurd to behave in the same way [as BMI]. Maps are far from innocent tools,&quot; said Judelson. The Syrian embassy also complained to TfL and CBS Outdoor, as well as to the Mayor of London and the UK Foreign Office, over the inclusion of the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in the 1967 six-day war and unilaterally annexed by Israel in 1981. &quot;It&apos;s an outrageous falsification of the facts and a violation of international law,&quot; said embassy spokesman Jihad Makdissi. &quot;We have reminded everyone of the legal aspect as well as the moral aspect.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Meaning &quot;there&quot; in Persian, this word is used by some Iranians to refer to Israel, during telephone conversations with friends or relatives living in the Jewish state. Their fear is that if they mention the word Israel, Iranian intelligence may pick up on the conversation, and arrest them. And in most cases, the party based in Israel fully participates, by using the other code word, which is &quot;inja&quot;. Meaning &quot;here&quot; in Persian, this word is also used to refer to Israel, so that their friend or relative in Iran does not get into trouble. On the surface, this fear is well founded. Iran has declared Israel as its main enemy and in theory no Iranian is allowed to visit Israel, or to communicate with an Israeli. However, the reality is different. Every year, hundreds of Iranian Jews travel to Israel via Turkey, and then return home. Despite the fact that they don&apos;t have any Israeli stamps in their passports, the Iranian authorities know very well that when an Iranian Jew goes to Turkey for holiday, his stay there usually consists of half a day. Enough to obtain a visa and then catch a flight to Tel Aviv. There have also been cases of immigrants from Iran who, after living in Israel, decided to go back and were not punished. Two weeks ago, I visited a school friend from Tehran, who lives near me in Tel Aviv. His mother was speaking to her cousin in Tehran. I was impressed how she stuck meticulously to using her code words and was very serious about it. And then, all of a sudden, I started giggling uncontrollably. I suddenly imagined for a moment that there is an Iranian spy listening on the line. &quot;He and his colleagues must be pulling their hair out in despair,&quot; I thought. These conversations with Iran are usually so mind-numbingly boring, that anyone would go out of their mind. I could just imagine Iran&apos;s intelligence minister, Gholam Hossein Ejehi, arresting one of the Jewish housewives in Tehran, not solely for the crime of talking to Israel, but because her dull conversations are sending his staff into a coma. &quot;In the name of God, Mrs Cohen, please stop talking about your recipe for ghorme sabzi (an Iranian dish), whose son got married, whose daughter is a harlot, and which family is tightfisted,&quot; I imagined him saying. &quot;I am losing staff here by the dozen. They can&apos;t take listening to these conversations any more. I tell you what. I will make a deal with you. I give you immunity to talk about anything you want. You name it. The nuclear programme? No problem. Just please, I beg you, talk about something interesting!&quot; It is also interesting how Ahmadinejad has turned many Iranian\u2013Israelis and Iranian Jews living abroad into ambassadors for the people of Iran. This has happened for all the wrong reasons. On 27 October 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched his first attack. During his speech in the World Without Zionism Conference, he stated: &quot;As the Imam (Khomeini) said, Israel must be wiped out.&quot; The eminent Chicago University professor, Juan Cole, and others have claimed that Ahmadinejad only threatened the &quot;Zionist entity&quot; and not Israel. However, it is possible that they did not see a report from the semi-official Fars agency, based in Tehran. The first paragraph quotes Ahmadinejad as saying: &quot;As the Imam said, Israel must be wiped out.&quot; On other occasions, Ahmadinejad has called for the destruction and removal of the &quot;Zionist regime&quot;. This term clearly refers to the Israeli government. But this is a call for regime change, and just as regime change in Iraq by a foreign force was wrong, so are Ahmadinejad&apos;s calls for regime change in Israel. All these threats have created a Nazi-like image of Iran in the foreign Jewish communities. Iranian Jews are sometimes asked: &quot;How could you live in such a racist country?&quot; or &quot;Would the Iranians slaughter their Jews like Hitler did?&quot; Although there is no love lost for Ahmadinejad, many Iranian Jews feel compelled to put the record straight by saying that ordinary Iranians are wonderful people and their president does not represent their views. They do not want Israel destroyed. Nevertheless, the actions and policies of the Iranian government towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continue to cause damage, not just for Israel and the Palestinians, but also for the people of Iran. Calls for the elimination of Israel are wrong and counter-productive for both sides. It is not Ayatollah Khamenei whose house is bombarded. While he is sitting comfortably in his well-protected residence, it is the people of Gaza and Lebanon who pay the price, with their lives and their property. Also, it is difficult to see how Khamenei and Ahmadinejad&apos;s animosity towards Israel serve the national interest of their country. Iran and Israel have no land or historic disputes. It wasn&apos;t Israel who invaded Iran. It was Iraq, not Israel, that killed more than half a million Iranians and caused close to half a trillion dollars&apos; damage to the Iranian economy. However, Khamenei shows no animosity towards Iraq. In fact, some rightwing Iranian clergy even wanted to help Saddam fight the Americans in 1991, despite his heinous acts. Yet, Israel which has no borders with Iran and in fact helped Iran during the war against Iraq by supplying weapons, is threatened with annihilation. One has to ask: apart from sanctions and isolation, what have the people of Iran gained from such policies? The coming elections in Iran could create a turnaround, at least in Iran&apos;s behaviour. The majority of Iranian-Israelis and Iranian Jews worldwide want to see a decrease in tensions. Their hope is that Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the reformist candidate, will win.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-25T07:00:00Z", "title": "Iran and Israel are not worlds apart | Meir Javedanfar", "sentences": ["Enough to obtain a visa and then catch a flight to Tel Aviv.", "Two weeks ago, I visited a school friend from Tehran, who lives near me in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/25/iran-israel-ahmadinejad"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Religion", "Islam", "World news", "ent and tourismHospitality, event managem", "Education"], "article": "Prior to last weekend, I had spent a full week firmly ensconced in the Bu&apos;ah \u2013 the cynical name given to the state of blissful ignorance in which many of Tel Aviv&apos;s residents dwell. Despite the physical proximity of the occupation, that the effects of the subjugation are not seen or felt on their very doorstep allows them to exist as though they have not a care in the world, rather than engage with the highly precarious and highly suspect way in which their leaders oppress the Palestinians under their control. While I try to visit the West Bank at least once a week, and usually do my best to follow domestic affairs with a keen interest, last week I morphed temporarily into the epitome of Bu&apos;ah beach bum; a combination of friends visiting from abroad and cloudless skies suspending my usual routine. The descent, I found, was as swift as it was dangerous: within a couple of days, I was becoming ever more ambivalent about the conflict. Despite its nagging presence in the back of my thoughts, it was turning into a case of out of sight, out of mind. Realising I ought to arrest the decline, but not quite ready to give up on the easy living just yet, a trip to the Galil region seemed as good a halfway house as any \u2013 and so it proved. After a day in Nazareth, we made our way to a guest house in Kafr Kana, the town where Jesus turned water into wine, and the site of regular Christian pilgrimage. The next day, following the newly mapped out Jesus Trail, we marched the 14 kilometres back to Nazareth, via some of the most stunning landscapes Israel has to offer. Cynics have branded the Jesus Trail a means to milk the tourists drawn to follow its route, and of course that is one motive of the innkeepers and restaurateurs keen to promote it to the local and international market. At the same time, the lure of the trail has the potential to do wonders for bringing together Israeli Jews and Arabs who, by and large, spend far more time in their own separate worlds than mixing together in any semblance of multiculturalism. As we walked, we crossed paths with other hikers: fellow Israelis, as well as Christian pilgrims from overseas, and a large group of Arab schoolchildren being shepherded along the route by their teachers. Our mutual interest in drinking in the scenery and soaking up the history led to cross-party conversation, and the sharing of ideas and information. As with enzymes, so it is with people. The chances of successful coupling of individual enzymes depend on the number of &quot;sticky ends&quot; attached to each molecule. The more sticky ends, the more likely that something would stick, and there is no better way to break down the entrenched division between two ethnic groups than to bring them together under the umbrella of a shared goal or activity. Granted, the underlying malaise at the heart of the conflict will not disappear on the back of a few fellow tourists sharing the same route, but the demystification of the other, and on equal terms, is a by no means insignificant experience. Nazareth itself embodies the theory often expounded by politicians that &quot;where there&apos;s tourism, there&apos;s no terrorism&quot;. The relative prosperity of the city&apos;s residents, compared with those of other Israeli-Arab communities, is directly linked to the fact that the religious sites draw tourists like bees to nectar. Israeli shoppers and sightseers are prevalent among the weekend day-trippers, and \u2013 on a superficial level \u2013 the town appears happy to welcome all and sundry. However, small pockets of resistance leave a bad taste in the mouth of those venturing into the locals&apos; midst. In the busiest square in the city, on the busiest day of the week, scores of Muslim worshippers gather to say Friday prayers, ostensibly as peacefully as the Christian faithful thronging the Basilica on the next street or the Jewish tourists winding their way through the souk&apos;s narrow alleyways. Yet the devil is in the detail; in this case, the enormous banner emblazoned across one wall of the square left no room for misinterpretation. &quot;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers,&quot; screamed the verse against a lurid green backdrop. Not just in Arabic, but in English too, so that as many passersby as possible would have the defiant message rammed down their throats. Any similar proclamation declaring only Jews to be worthy of God&apos;s love would, or should, be instantly decried by those with an interest in tolerance and coexistence, especially if displayed in such a prominent and provocative manner rather than in private. The sentiment behind the verse is bad enough, the deliberate translation into English and positioning of the banner in the centre of town even worse. Those responsible for its location are no fools; rather, they have a vested interest in wearing their hearts on their sleeves in order to fire up their co-religionists, as well as send a warning to those outside their camp. We have similar extremists on the Jewish side, and the Christian and Hindu worlds are by no means exempt from such fundamentalists. But just because dogmatism and division are endemic to many religious zealots does not make them any more conscionable. The simple hanging of one such banner can unravel all the good work carried out by those citizens for whom it is more important to promote tolerance and interaction than eternal division and damnation. And, in the here and now, rather than what may or may not await us on the other side of the ether, the interests of the Israeli-Arab community are not served by scaring off those who have crossed the divide to frequent their city. Such sentiments only add to the mistrust felt (usually unreasonably) by many on the Israeli side, and \u2013 if left to flourish unchecked \u2013 play their part in encouraging thousands of Israelis to remain holed up in their own private bubbles.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-26T08:00:00Z", "title": "Bursting bubbles on the Jesus Trail | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Prior to last weekend, I had spent a full week firmly ensconced in the Bu&apos;ah \u2013 the cynical name given to the state of blissful ignorance in which many of Tel Aviv&apos;s residents dwell."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/26/israel-arabs-division-tourism"}, {"tags": ["Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "La Roux", "Little Boots"], "article": "For fans of electronic music, this should be a triumphant moment.

Little Boots is jamming on her Tenori-on with Bill Turnbull on BBC Breakfast, while La Roux hovers, stubbornly, in the upper reaches of the charts. DIY electro is coming home. Rule Brit-ronica!  But is it really a cause for celebration? Don&apos;t get me wrong, I can see the potent symbolism of a young, self-reliant woman playing a Stylophone on Later With Jools Holland, and I&apos;m a sucker for La Roux&apos;s killer hooks. But if this is electro pop&apos;s victory parade, it feels hollow. Where is the abrasive edge, the awkwardness? For all their intelligence and apparent independence, Little Boots and La Roux look and sound like polished professional pop stars: ambitious, eager-to-please, sonically and psychologically smooth. Karin &quot;Fever Ray&quot; Dreijer Andersson they ain&apos;t.  While they may have the look of a vanguard, Little Boots, La Roux, Frankmuzik and the much-touted, Delphic (basically, Coldplay with synths), are not forging openings for stranger, more interesting music. This year has already been a vintage one for genuinely innovative electro pop, but, in mainstream media terms, you wouldn&apos;t know it. Despite this sudden appetite for synth pop over landfill indie, nothing has changed. Safe, saleable, unchallenging music gets the hype and support, while cerebral, wayward pop (the kind of stuff that would have got a hearing in the much-romanticised 80s) is left to moulder in the margins.  It doesn&apos;t help, perhaps, that two of the year&apos;s best electro-pop albums \u2013 Telefon Tel Aviv&apos;s Immolate Yourself, and Junior Boy&apos;s Begone Dull Care, extraordinary despite lukewarm reviews \u2013 are rather reserved records, made by thoughtful, intelligent people (RIP Charles Wesley Cooper III). Very much growers not show-ers, these albums require patience, repeated listens and deep immersion, but the rewards are many. Personally, I&apos;ll take their considered elegance, moreish melodies, strange sibilance and claustrophobic intensity over a slick package of soundbites, singles and self-confident showmanship.  If you want flamboyant, however, can I point you in the direction of Damian Lazarus&apos;s similarly brilliant Smoke the Monster Out? Less troubled and deep than Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s Debut, it still captures the atmosphere of late-night clubland \u2013 the transcendent freedom, the fuzzy unreality, the implicit emptiness, the dysfunction \u2013 with a similar potent accuracy. That it does so by fusing Ricardo Villalobos and Robert Wyatt, and slipping in a Scott Walker cover, might explain why it is not being hailed as one of the crossover albums of the year. But it is.  Less immediate but equally meaty are the Moderat and AGF/Delay albums. The Modeselektor-Apparat collaboration is a pop record, but a dubstep inflected one that sounds like it was recorded in a deserted Berlin power station. In winter. It is gloomy of bass, lurching of riff, awash with gravelly breakbeats, yet the vocal tracks provide some of the most richly atmospheric pop music of the year. Likewise, AGF/Delay&apos;s Symptoms will conjure a shiver of excitement in anybody who loves the Knife&apos;s mix of morphing, metallic anguish and natty melodies.  This is nothing new, of course. Good electronic music is forever falling through the cracks in pop culture. We could also talk about Chelonis R Jones or Circlesquare, both of whom defy easy categorisation, or Matthew Dear&apos;s Asa Breed album or Jenny Wilson&apos;s amazing, widely ignored Love and Youth.

Rather than carrying a prayer book with me, I have an e-siddur installed on my phone for just such occasions, allowing me instant access to the necessary text. Likewise, I don&apos;t bother buying a paper anymore, preferring to sit and read the news via my phone&apos;s LCD screen; over the space of the 40-minute bus ride, I&apos;d devoured articles and op-ed columns from a plethora of publications with the greatest of ease. By using my phone in this way, I play my part in contributing to the slow death of both the media and publishing industries, not to mention all the related trades which suffer in the wake of their decline. Publishers of prayer books miss out on the revenue from potential purchasers who opt instead for free online versions; likewise, newspapers have lost control of their own content, and are paying a heavy price for their incapacity. As far as newspapers are concerned, there appears little that can be done to stop the rot, save for desperately trying to salvage some scraps of revenue from online advertising and subscription. For the publishing world, however, there is still time to address the potential catastrophe awaiting the industry, if only those at the helm of the flotilla are willing to chart a course out of earshot of the e-book sirens&apos; song. It is no secret that the moment the music business sold its soul to the compact disc devil, the industry was in serious trouble. CDs, followed by MP3s, meant that the listening public now had access to high quality files of their favourite music, and could pirate copies at will, should their desire to save money prove more compelling than their sense of ethics. The music industry went into near-terminal decline in the Napster years, thanks to an inability to keep control over, or make money from, the copyrighted material for which the record companies had paid through the nose. The lure of forcing consumers to &quot;upgrade&quot; from vinyl to CD, then from CD to MP3, was financially expedient in the short term, but in the long term was a modern-day equivalent of Dorian Gray&apos;s fateful pact. The publishing world is teetering on the brink of a similarly suicidal drop today. With the advent of the Kindle, along with all manner of related new royalty systems and e-publishing deals, the industry is being lured into a trap from which it might never escape \u2013 and it&apos;s easy to see why they&apos;re tempted. Borders&apos; latest financial results showed a 12% decline in revenue at its bookshops, largely due to the impact of the credit crisis, and in a climate where the public has less disposal money to spend, low-cost models such as e-book publications are seen as a natural way for publishers to ride out the economic storm. With resistance weakening towards the concept of e-books, Amazon reported a 24% increase in earnings in the first quarter of this year, driven in no small parts by sales of its Kindle e-reader. &quot;Kindle sales have exceeded our most optimistic expectations,&quot; Amazon&apos;s CEO Jeff Bezos declared, and with endorsements from the likes of Oprah Winfrey ringing in the ears of the book-reading public, the e-explosion looks set to continue apace, sucking in both consumers and publishers alike. However, while in its embryonic stage there seems every reason for publishers to scramble aboard the e-book bandwagon, it won&apos;t be long before the same pirates who ransacked the music industry will do the same to the book world. As inevitable as night following day, so too criminals flock to the site of any money-making operation, exploiting every available technological loophole to steal copyrighted material and bleed much-needed revenue from the affected industry. Some people oppose the Kindle and its competitors on the grounds of purist, elitist snobbery, claiming that nothing compares to the touch, smell and familiarity of a printed book when it comes to reading for pleasure. But, just as the vinyl Luddites have been left to all but rot by the music industry&apos;s wayside, so too in time will the anti-e-book establishment. If the bulk of the consumer market is happy to embrace progress and make use of more convenient systems of reading, or listening to music, then their money will talk far louder to the salesmen than the faint complaints of those refusing to move with the times. Those opposed to the Kindle&apos;s inexorable march are right, but for the wrong reasons. If the publishing industry were to suffer a similar affliction as the music industry&apos;s recent malaise, then the lack of money available to publishers would seriously stymie their ability to nurture new talent in the writing world \u2013 and that&apos;s far more serious a problem than the format in which manuscripts are read by the consumer. Authors, myself included, also have a responsibility to put the industry&apos;s long-term health above short-term financial gain. E-book royalty percentages are far higher than those made from traditional books; but if the net result of the e-book transition is to mortally wound the publishing industry, then the next generation of up-and-coming writers will have no one to blame for their plight than those who came before them. Sitting on the bus and considering the way in which I employ technology to save both effort and money when accessing text, I was aware how swiftly one can become blinded by the dazzle of short-term gain, but the onus of responsibility is on us to see past such a stance. Until the right safeguards have been put in place by the publishing industry to protect their work (and they certainly haven&apos;t been to date), then ushering in an e-book era could sound the death knell for the whole publishing enterprise. The lessons of recent history spell it out loud and clear, and we would all be wise not to doom ourselves to repeat them.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-28T17:00:01Z", "title": "We must make e-books pirate-proof | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["On Monday, I said the traveller&apos;s prayer when getting on the bus, as I do every time I go on a journey out of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/28/writers-kindle-revolution"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "Egypt", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "US politics", "Africa"], "article": "Israeli alarm is growing over Barack Obama&apos;s perceived tilt away from the Jewish state and towards its historic Arab foes. Whether this shift is merely tactical, and related to the peace process,or of longer-term strategic significance, is actively debated. But the White House&apos;s changing outlook will be on display on Thursday when the US leader embraces Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. Egypt&apos;s president is the authoritarian leader of a police state. While Obama symbolises equality, opportunity and democratic legitimacy, Mubarak represents an oligarchic ruling elite whose power is secured by a permanent state of emergency, arrest without trial, fear and torture. Human Rights Watch this week listed the systematic abuses that keep Mubarak in power. Ayman Nour, Mubarak&apos;s opponent in 2005&apos;s fiddled presidential election, was released from jail before the Obama visit. He now believes he would be safer behind bars after he was attacked in the street, a not uncommon fate for establishment critics. &quot;I&apos;m denied all rights ... I am stalked by the police ... There is no ceiling to the injustice and revenge of this regime,&quot; he told the Los Angeles Times. Obama officials say the choice of Cairo for his kiss-and-make-up speech to the Muslim world does not amount to an endorsement of Egypt&apos;s unlovely government. Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, last week met members of Egyptian pro-democracy groups (but not the Muslim Brotherhood, the biggest, banned opposition party). She urged Egypt to &quot;exhibit more respect for human rights&quot;. But Clinton&apos;s meeting in Washington looked like a way of avoiding embarrassing encounters in Cairo with people such as Nour, who has not been invited to meet Obama. Ignoring the likely charge, routinely levelled at his Oval office predecessors, that he is propping up Arab dictators who oppress the very Muslim populations he seeks to befriend, Obama praised Mubarak this week as a &quot;stalwart ally&quot;. The Obama-Mubarak encounter will follow closely a notably amicable summit last week with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, who was showered with praise by the US leader. Obama is also travelling to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. One aim is to elicit conciliatory &quot;gestures&quot; by King Abdullah that may help persuade Israel to unblock the peace process. But viewed from Tel Aviv, the Riyadh visit, plus Israel&apos;s absence from the White House travel schedule, looks like more unsettling Obama-Arab cosy cuddling. The contrast with Obama&apos;s increasingly abrasive treatment of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s prime minister, is striking. Since their mostly unproductive meeting in Washington last month, Obama and his acolytes have taken to almost daily, public exhortations to Netanyahu to meet his &quot;roadmap obligations&quot; and freeze all settlement activity, without exceptions, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They argue a settlement freeze is essential if the peace process is to be revived. Israel&apos;s response has grown increasingly frenetic. Senior Israeli officials, including Dan Meridor, the deputy PM, and Uzi Arad, the national security adviser, met secretly in London last week with George Mitchell, Obama&apos;s Middle East envoy. But Mitchell was unflinching and the talks flopped. Now Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, is in Washington, trying to find some give in the US position \u2013 so far without success. Obama is adamant he will strongly uphold the US-Israel security alliance. But when it comes to the peace process, Israeli officials complain he has reneged on a secret understanding with George Bush, in which the US publicly condemned settlement expansion while privately accepting &quot;natural&quot; growth. Obama is also said to have scrapped a &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; with Ariel Sharon, the former prime minister, that Israel could expect to retain major West Bank settlements in any future peace deal. Added to all this, a slackening in support from pro-Israel members of the US Congress, who have bought Obama&apos;s argument that ending the Israel-Palestine conflict is in the US national security interest, has left Netanyahu reeling, observers say. &quot;Looking for loopholes and hidden agreements that have often existed in the past with Washington, [Netanyahu] has been flummoxed by an unusually united line [on settlements],&quot; said Laura Rozen in Foreign Policy magazine. Reports that Washington may squeeze Israel by withholding habitual diplomatic backing at the UN and by conditioning its financial support are adding to the pressure. &quot;What the hell do they want from me?&quot; an exasperated Netanyahu recently asked a colleague, Rozen reported. He played the Iran card in Washington, but it didn&apos;t work. Obama seems to means what he says. And dismantling a few West Bank outposts is not enough. Something will have to give soon \u2013 and there is speculation that it will be Netanyahu, whose fragile rightwing coalition probably could not survive major concessions on settlements. Obama&apos;s tilt may have some surprising consequences.

Growing discord between Israel and the US and a potential win for Hezbollah in the Lebanese elections on Sunday are just two issues that are making for some rough weather in the region. But the real tempest on the horizon remains the ever-growing possibility that Iran will achieve nuclear breakout capability in the near future. This prospect is one which leaves Israel stuck between two extremely unpalatable choices. The first is to do nothing and look on as Iran becomes a nuclear power and regional hegemon. Instead of attempting to knock out Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, Israel could simply get used to the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran and devise a strategic doctrine for defence taking into account this new reality. The implications of a nuclear Iran for the Middle East are not rosy. The various Iranian proxies in the region, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, would be able to operate under Tehran&apos;s nuclear umbrella with something approaching impunity, making a comprehensive peace settlement even harder to achieve then it is now. This is not to mention the problem of a hostile, theocratic and possibly millenarian regime possessing nuclear weapons. However, the difficulties involved in any military operation have persuaded some analysts that Israel will just have to make the best of a bad situation. But such a policy may not be possible in the face of Israeli public opinion which genuinely sees Iran as a dire threat to its security. A recent poll conducted by the Center for Iranian studies at Tel Aviv University found that as many as 30% of Israelis would consider emigrating from the country should Iran attain a nuclear weapon. It is harder for Israel&apos;s citizens and politicians to dismiss Iran&apos;s nuclear programme than it is for the rest of the world, when it is accompanied by the frequent apocalyptic declarations of the country&apos;s leaders about the future of the &quot;Zionist entity&quot;. The alternative is for Israel to attempt a unilateral surprise bombing campaign against Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities in the knowledge that its air force can, at best, merely set back Tehran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. In so doing, a regional conflagration would almost certainly break out in which Israel would come under rocket bombardment from Hezbollah in Lebanon and ballistic missile fire from Iran itself and possibly Syria too. It is also likely that Iran would launch missiles at US bases in the Gulf. In addition, the price of oil would hit unprecedented heights and deal a new blow to a weakened global economy, especially if tanker traffic through the Straits of Hormuz was disturbed for any significant length of time. Not only are the consequences of an attack extremely dangerous for Israel, but the success of such a mission is by no means guaranteed. The distance of Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities from Israel put them at the extreme limit of Israeli fighter-jets, they are scattered throughout the country and defended by advanced Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles such as the TOR-M1 system. These conditions complicate any potential Israeli strike, which could leave the country embroiled in a multi-front war and the target of international anger at having imperilled the security of the Gulf states and the global economy. While dealing with those problems, it is possible that that the airstrikes would not achieve even the limited goal of delaying Tehran&apos;s march to a nuclear weapon. An alternative scenario is one in which negotiations go nowhere and the US gives grudging approval and even support for an Israeli attack, which will make certain logistical aspects of such a mission easier for Israel. This outcome, even though unlikely, could become more realistic if the Obama administration suffers any more serious foreign policy setbacks. North Korea&apos;s recent nuclear test was a severe blow to America&apos;s strategy of engagement and President Obama will not be keen to see Iran go nuclear on his watch, for domestic political reasons if nothing else. Should Hezbollah come out on top in the Lebanese elections, then US policy in the Middle East to bolster western-oriented governments will have suffered another serious blow. It is unclear how many more such setbacks Washington is prepared to accept. But another option exists which still has not yet been tried properly, despite seven years of negotiations in which various interlocutors have tried to persuade, coax and cajole Tehran into backing down from its unyielding stance, with very little success. It is the option of immediate, swift and firm diplomatic action, focused first on getting Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment within a short time-frame and, failing this, imposing targeted sanctions against Iranian interests. If a more accommodating attitude is not taken by the Iranian government in the months following the presidential elections, then sanctions directed at Iran&apos;s oil and gas industry could be imposed, as proposed by analysts such as Emanuele Ottolenghi. Iran&apos;s energy sector is particularly dependent on foreign development and technology, and sanctions against it could seriously damage the regime in Tehran and elicit a more conciliatory approach. If, however, the international community fails to address Iran&apos;s nuclear programme with the immediacy it deserves, Israel may well feel that, despite the risks, it has no choice but to attempt to forestall by military means what it perceives to be a grave threat to its existence. The result will not be pretty, but no-one should underestimate how seriously Israel takes this problem. If catastrophe in the region is to be averted then the global powers must act now. Otherwise they will see their position reduced to observers as either Iran goes nuclear or Israel takes matters into its own hands, with all the dire consequences that these eventualities would entail for the Middle East and the wider world.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T09:10:28Z", "title": "What should Israel do about Iran? | Jeremy Sharon", "sentences": ["A recent poll conducted by the Center for Iranian studies at Tel Aviv University found that as many as 30% of Israelis would consider emigrating from the country should Iran attain a nuclear weapon."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/03/israel-iran-nuclear-weapons"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news"], "article": "Amos Elon, who has died aged 82, was one of Israel&apos;s most celebrated intellectuals, renowned for his powers of observation and his scathing criticisms. In 1970 he was already a well-known correspondent for the newspaper Ha&apos;aretz when he published his seminal book The Israelis: Founders and Sons. An instant bestseller in Hebrew, and in English from 1971, it became required reading in schools and mirrored the lives of Israelis. Founders and Sons looked back to before the Jewish republic&apos;s creation in 1948, and forward from its 1967 military victory. It described what most knew, but few articulated - that the torch was passing to a native-born generation. More pointedly, Elon criticised Israel&apos;s otherwise idealistic creators for ignoring Arab national hopes. &quot;The chief chronicler of the Israeli story,&quot; as Ha&apos;aretz dubbed Elon, became a Cassandra, warning that the recently conquered West Bank represented &quot;a victory worse than defeat&quot;. &quot;What God and Abraham discussed in the bronze age&quot; would never bring peace, insisted Elon. An advocate of reconciliation, he dreamed of a new Athens but saw a corrupted Sparta grow instead. In 1974, he published Between Enemies: a Compassionate Dialogue, based on letters to and from Sana Hassan, daughter of Egypt&apos;s ambassador to Washington. From 1978 to 1983 he spent three months each year visiting and writing from Egypt. Nationalists and even some leftists condemned Elon for decamping to Tuscany in the 1990s. Yet he still analysed current events and predicted future trouble with frightening accuracy. In 2004 he warned that, without any promise of a Palestinian state, Israel&apos;s impending evacuation from Gaza was merely creating a &quot;powder keg&quot;. And last year, despite the onset of leukaemia, he expertly teased out the conflicts and contradictions of the Olmert administration in a New York Review of Books essay. Elon was himself one of the founding generation, though neither he nor his parents subscribed wholeheartedly to the prevailing socialist Zionist ethos. He was born in Vienna, arriving in 1933 as a child in the British mandate of Palestine, where his father, a reluctant bourgeois \u00e9migr\u00e9, set up an import-export business in Tel Aviv.  Like many Palestinian Jews of his generation, he lived a double life. As a law student at Tel Aviv University from 1944 to 1946, he frequented Hebrew-speaking literary cafes and joined the Haganah underground. Yet at home, all conversation was in German, and German books lined the shelves. Noted for his literary flair, eye for detail and linguistic proficiency, Elon began writing for Ha&apos;aretz in 1951 and continued while reading history at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem (1950-52), and as a British Council scholar to Peterhouse, Cambridge (1953-54). Two years later Ha&apos;aretz posted him abroad, to France, Poland, Germany and the US in turn, making him in effect Israel&apos;s eye on the outside world. In 1961 Elon met and married Beth Drexler, a vivacious literary agent, in Washington. Back in Israel in 1965, he joined the Ha&apos;aretz editorial board. Although chided for omitting from Founders and Sons eastern European Yiddish-speakers, Jews from the Middle East and the religiously observant, in the 1950s he was among the first to unmask the discrimination that new immigrants faced in Israel. Following a freelance spell from 1971 to 1977, he returned as a Ha&apos;aretz staffer and, from 1985, started writing history books and contributing columns to American and British journals.  His reports bubbled with wit and panache, evincing the sort of elegant playfulness laced with serious intent that typified another cultivated, assimilated Viennese Jew, Theodor Herzl. Elon&apos;s 1975 biography of Herzl, who founded political Zionism in the 19th century, vividly portrayed the man with all his quirks, inventiveness and shortcomings, not least his failure to recognise the presence of Arabs in Palestine. In Jerusalem: City of Mirrors (1990), an affectionate yet ultimately sorrowful book, Elon lamented how Arab and Jewish ideologues had mythologised and manipulated the city so that its inhabitants &quot;hated [their] fellow man to the glory of God&quot;. Borrowing from the Yeats poem, he entitled his 1997 collection of dispatches from the Middle East A Blood-Dimmed Tide. Spanning 30 years, it gets close to the soul of the conflict. It includes first-hand reports of the pitiful retreat of Egyptian soldiers in the 1967 war and explains how the Oslo peace process, the product of two &quot;obscure, freelance peaceniks&quot;, raised expectations only to unleash &quot;ancient hatreds&quot;. As a journalist Elon interviewed international leaders including Yasser Arafat and King Hussein. Ensconced in his Tuscan retreat, he increasingly turned from the narrow focus of Israel/Palestine towards the western European Jewish past. In 1996 he released his magisterial biography of Mayer Amschel, founder of the Rothschild dynasty, and in 2002 came his last book, The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933, which highlighted years of unprecedented Jewish success in the arts, science and enterprise, abruptly terminated by the rise of Hitler. When reviewers criticised his original version for ignoring poorer, religious or less academic Jews, he amended the subtitle of its British imprint from &quot;a history&quot; to &quot;a portrait&quot;. Yet he retained his contentious assertion that there was nothing inevitable about the Holocaust - naive and self-loathing, thundered some critics. In an interview in 2004, conducted when he sold his flat in Jerusalem, Elon admitted his disappointment at an Israel where militarism and materialism seemed rampant. Zionism, he thought, had &quot;exhausted itself, precisely because it had accomplished its aims&quot;, while Arabs, &quot;whatever their subsequent follies and outrages ... had been punished for the sins of Europe&quot;. A dedicated secularist, perhaps he sought in Italy an identity that was as much European as Israeli or Jewish. Elon could be mild-mannered and charming, yet also austere and restrained. Rare insights into his guarded private life appear in a 2005 film by his cinematographer daughter, Danae. Called Another Road Home, the documentary traces the relationship between her family and that of Musa Obeidallah, their Palestinian housekeeper in Jerusalem. Like her father&apos;s books, it leads into some uncomfortable byways. The Pity of It All echoed themes he raised in his first book, Journey Through a Haunted Land: The New Germany, released in Israel in 1967. It showed sympathy for ordinary Germans and remains a potent memorial to cold-war Europe. As in all nine of his books, Elon proved highly perceptive about how venal politics damages individuals. He is survived by his wife, his daughter and a sister. \u2022 Amos Elon, essayist, journalist and historian, born 4 July 1926; died 25 May 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Amos Elon", "sentences": ["He was born in Vienna, arriving in 1933 as a child in the British mandate of Palestine, where his father, a reluctant bourgeois \u00e9migr\u00e9, set up an import-export business in Tel Aviv.", "As a law student at Tel Aviv University from 1944 to 1946, he frequented Hebrew-speaking literary cafes and joined the Haganah underground."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/04/obitaury-amos-elon"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Lebanon", "US foreign policy"], "article": "Foreign policy experts and commentators have been trying to elucidate an &quot;Obama doctrine&quot; ever since the new US president took office. Lebanon&apos;s surprise election result, in which a pro-western coalition narrowly triumphed, suggests these analysts have got things the wrong way round. Whatever the theory may be, the Beirut turnabout is the first, circumstantial evidence of a tangible &quot;Obama effect&quot; in the Middle East. It could be catching. It would be fanciful to claim that Obama&apos;s bridge-building speech to the Muslim world in Cairo last week, attractive though it was, crucially influenced Lebanese voters. But the calmer, unconfrontational tone adopted by Washington on Middle East issues since George Bush trudged home to Texas appears to have struck a chord in a country that was teetering on the brink of sectarian civil war one year ago. Pre-election visits by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, and Joe Biden, the US vice-president, underscored the importance that Obama attached to the poll. Some resented these interventions as unwarranted interference. But many Lebanese, particularly the nearly 40% of the population that is Christian, seem to have approved of Washington&apos;s increased engagement; and to have heard its implicit message that a vote for Hezbollah and its allies would be a backwards step. That refrain was underscored by exaggerated claims that Hezbollah and its Tehran backers, if further empowered, would turn Lebanon into a second Gaza. And if that was not enough, an eve-of-poll demarche by Boutros Sfeir, spiritual leader of the country&apos;s Maronite Christians, may have done the trick. He warned the country was in danger. It was clear from whom he believed the danger emanated. By giving the nod to Saad Hariri and his 14 March bloc of Sunni Muslim, Druze and Christian parties, which won 71 parliamentary seats against 57 for the opposition, Lebanon has provided Obama with his first significant regional policy success. The result is a setback for Iran, which has sought enhanced influence via Hezbollah. And it confirmed Lebanon&apos;s 2005 rejection of Syria as the master manipulator of its affairs, confounding suggestions that Damascus was inching back. The results are also a boost for western-leaning Arab regimes, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, that helped prevent Lebanon falling into the abyss after the assassination of Hariri&apos;s father, the former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and the subsequent, disastrous Hezbollah-Israel war of 2006. Saudi Arabia&apos;s rapprochement with Syria, and a parallel warming of ties between Syria and the US, will be all the easier to pursue as a result of Sunday&apos;s election. In contrast, the rightwing Israeli government of Binyamin Netanyahu may view the vote with ambivalence. The prospect of the non-ideological Hariri as Lebanon&apos;s prime minister, a likely though not yet certain outcome, must be welcome in Tel Aviv. But this dash to moderation robs Israel&apos;s favourite contemporary narrative \u2013 the inexorable, region-wide advance of an existentially threatening, nuclear armed Iran \u2013 of some of its power to alarm. Peace suddenly breaking out is not part of the story as told by Netanyahu, not while the mullahs march unchecked. The Palestinians know this only too well. Visiting London earlier this year, Hariri spoke of &quot;four fateful years&quot; that had followed his father&apos;s murder culminating in this month&apos;s &quot;historic&quot; election. &quot;We are determined to end the sectarian violence. We want to put the years of turmoil behind us,&quot; he said. This could be achieved by continuing the dialogue with Hezbollah and other opposition groups that produced a unity government last year. Noting increased US engagement, he urged the EU to do more. Hariri will need all the help he can get, for power-sharing is only one of many daunting challenges. His ally, Walid Jumblatt, the veteran Druze leader, said this week that Hezbollah should be included in a new unity government but that the veto power it gained in last year&apos;s compromise should not be renewed. The Shia party will fiercely resist any attempt to reduce its influence, just as it continues to resist demands that it disarm. Massive economic difficulties, the uncertain impact of the international tribunal investigating Rafiq Hariri&apos;s murder, problems with Palestinian factions and Sunni militants linked to al-Qaida and border disputes with Israel and Syria also await Lebanon&apos;s new leaders. None of this will be sorted out quickly if at all. But Hariri has a powerful friend. Having got the result he wanted, Obama will help. And who knows? It&apos;s possible that watching Iranians will be encouraged in their turn to go out and vote for reformist, west-friendly candidates in Friday&apos;s presidential election.

Security guards have been placed on landfill sites in Tel Aviv to keep treasure hunters away, as word spread in Israel of what must be the worst exchange since Aladdin&apos;s battered old magic lantern was swapped for a shiny new one.

Written by Caryl Churchill during the three-week war on Gaza in January, the play caused outrage when it was first performed at London&apos;s Royal Court theatre in February. The BBC declined to broadcast a radio production of the play, which faced accusations of being one-sided and even antisemitic. The Guardian later filmed a version of the piece, which can be seen online. Some Jewish leaders accused the Royal Court of violating a theatrical rule: that plays critical of, and entirely populated by, characters from one community are only defensible if written by a member of that community. Others championed the play as an empathetic and nuanced work. In a four-star review, the Guardian&apos;s Michael Billington wrote: &quot;The play solves nothing, but shows theatre&apos;s power to heighten consciousness and articulate moral outrage.&quot; The Israeli production was staged as part of a wider campaign organised by a coalition of leftwing groups against the two-year blockade of the Gaza Strip. &quot;I love the way [Churchill] wrote it,&quot; said one of the cast, Sarah von Schwartze. &quot;You can see she understands how Israelis came to be in this situation.&quot; The new production was directed by Samieh Jabbarin, an Arab-Israeli theatre artist based in Jaffa. Jabbarin is currently under indefinite house arrest after being apprehended in protests against the far right at the Arab-Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm in February; he directed proceedings via phone and Skype. &quot;Churchill has achieved a beautiful artistic communication of a fundamental yet subversive truth: profound pain has no home,&quot; he said. &quot;Pain is pain is pain. Pain is universally human.&quot; The performance in Rabin Square featured a terror-stricken woman constantly rearranging a row of sacks around her baby&apos;s pram, in increasingly restrictive barricade formations.

Later, and with suspicious rapidity, the electoral commission pointed to a landslide victory for Ahmedinejad. Mousavi and his supporters had insisted before that any outcome other than their victory could only have been achieved through vote rigging. A crescendo of electoral mania has struck Tehran over the last week as Iran witnessed the biggest mobilisation of people since the events of the 1979 revolution, with massive crowds marching in support of both Ahmedinejad and Mousavi. While Ahmedinejad clearly does enjoy popular support across the country, the extreme margin and rapidity of his victory, as well as the actions of the security services raise great suspicion. In the early hours of the morning, reports from the capital warned of an increasing security presence, and then of blockades across the city and around the Interior Ministry, as well as a surrounding by security officials of the headquarters of both reformist candidates: Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi. Communications by SMS and some calls to mobiles were blocked; newspapers carried notifications banning public gatherings. Some commentators were quick to brand this a coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. To add a twist, film-director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, stated in an interview with Radio Farda just a few hours ago that Mousavi&apos;s office had been informed by the interior ministry that they have won \u2013 but may not yet publicise this result. Others have reported that, under pressure from the security forces and after meeting with the Supreme Leader, Mousavi and Karrubi have accepted defeat. As yet nothing seems certain. The office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has, in a surprise move, explicitly distanced the leader from the influential backer of Mousavi, Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani, an ex-president and head of the Expediency Council, had been recently accused, along with his family, of corruption by Ahmedinejad. The Supreme Leader, possibly wary of alienating his own support base which clearly lies much more among the pious Ahmedinejad sympathisers than among Mousavi&apos;s allies, has turned against Mousavi. More significantly, he has turned against Rafsanjani, a key pragmatist, whose fall from grace, would significantly redraw the political field. It is unclear at this stage if significant electoral fraud did take place. Certainly there were many warnings that it would. Some believe, on the basis of wide travel and informal polling, that Mousavi&apos;s vote share was much larger than recorded. Others are largely convinced by the results \u2013 suggesting that Mousavi&apos;s supporters were isolated from their opponents and did not realise the full extent of Ahmedinejad&apos;s popular support. Notwithstanding the possibility of electoral fraud, Ahmedinejad clearly enjoys significant popular support. The president speaks a language accessible to the average Iranian \u2013 the urban poor and those living in rural villages, suffering from unemployment and spiralling prices in these hard economic times. Ahmedinejad uses various populist tricks to woo supporters \u2013 from handing out potatoes to the poor, to pressurising banks to lend money at less than the real interest rates. His administration has done good work improving infrastructure in rural areas, but to achieve this and to fund increases in some pensions and subsidies, the oil reserve fund created by his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami, has been plundered. Despite widespread criticism of his misuse of Iran&apos;s oil wealth and the disastrous inflationary implication of these policies, popular support remains, and Ahmedinejad counters opposition statistics with his own cooked numbers. Ahmedinejad has also won favour with his people, and many across the Muslim world, for his spunky, outspoken remarks whether in relation to foreign relations with the US and Israel, or regarding domestic questions such as Iran&apos;s nuclear rights. A Tehrani friend, whose vote would clearly lie with a reformist, discussed with me back in London Ahmedinejad&apos;s comments regarding Iran&apos;s supposed lack of homosexuals. My friend and his girlfriend were amused by their president&apos;s por ruhi (cheeky chutzpah). As they saw it, he had been faced with a question which he could not answer truthfully; so he gave an answer he knew was preposterous but that dodged the question. More generally, for some, Ahmedinejad has restored a sense of pride which many Iranians feel the international community has denied their country. Of course, for many others, his comments, particularly regarding the Holocaust are a source of continued humiliation. The election result, if confirmed, will be a harsh disappointment for the many Iranians who had vested (probably unrealistic) hopes in the reformist, Mousavi. It will also displease Washington, London, Tel Aviv and other Western governments, perhaps playing into the hands of hawks objecting to President Obama&apos;s promised engagement and advocating instead tighter sanctions for Iran or even military action. But, Ahmedinejad&apos;s triumph does not rule out the imperative of a continued constructive engagement with Tehran. Rapprochement, or opposition to it, was not the decisive aspect of Ahmedinejad&apos;s campaign. Roxana Saberi has stated that international pressure played a major role in securing her release: Tehran and Ahmedinejad are listening. And, despite the possible reelection of Ahmedinejad&apos;s administration, much has changed. The first-ever series of televised debates between presidential candidates brought an unprecedented public airing of dirty laundry as Ahmedinejad was branded a &quot;dictator&quot; and Rafsanjani and his cronies were denounced for their nepotistic corruption. These debates broke taboos and openly discussed thorny topics such as political prisoners, women&apos;s and minority rights, and press freedoms. The record of the revolutionary government was directly criticised in harsher terms than ever before (to the shock of many). Much of the most destructive criticism (for the regime) came from Ahmedinejad himself \u2013 it is interesting to speculate if he will seek to substantially reform politics in a second term. The huge wave of enthusiasm preceding this election polarised Iranians at home and abroad, but brought millions to the polls. There remains a possibility that Mousavi&apos;s supporters will protest a final result that favours Ahmedinejad. In any event, these very imperfect elections have underscored the desire of Iranians to participate in determining their own future. In the coming days, the actions of the Supreme Leader will be of the utmost importance. Already weakened by the humiliating events of the last week and facing a ruling elite divided into factions, he seems to have chosen to back Ahmedinejad against the powerful triumvirate of Rafsanjani/Mousavi/Khatami. He may face in coming days continued indirect challenges to the political system which he heads. Yesterday, the 22nd of Khordad in the Persian calendar, marked a major turning point in Iran&apos;s post-revolutionary history.

The challenge for the prime minister when he speaks at the Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv, will be to find a way to reduce pressure from Washington without breaking up his rightwing coalition. Israeli reports suggest Netanyahu will choose his words carefully but will, as before, stop short of explicitly endorsing an independent Palestinian state. Instead, he is expected to offer some kind of acceptance of the US road map, produced in 2003, with conditions, and he is likely to stress that he wants the Palestinians and Arab states to recognise Israel as a Jewish state. Even accepting the road map presents complications for Netanyahu, because, while it calls on Palestinians to curb militancy, it also envisages an &quot;independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state&quot; existing alongside Israel and commits Israel to freezing all settlement activity. Netanyahu&apos;s speech comes in the wake of Barack Obama&apos;s address to the Muslim world in Cairo. The US president&apos;s words for Israel in that speech were clear: he called for a &quot;stop&quot; to Israel&apos;s settlement project. Nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers live in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Settlements on occupied land are regarded as illegal under international law and Obama himself said the settlements undermine peace efforts. He added: &quot;The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.&quot; However, Netanyahu has said in recent weeks that he intends to continue building within settlements to meet the needs of what Israel calls &quot;natural growth&quot;. That seems to pitch him towards a diplomatic confrontation with Washington, which today&apos;s speech may not be enough to prevent. Many in Netanyahu&apos;s coalition strongly support the settler movement and do not believe the Palestinians should be allowed an independent state. Last week Benny Begin, a prominent MP in Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party and son of the former prime minister Menachem Begin, said of the two-state solution: &quot;If this is the only solution then there is no solution.&quot; He, and others like him, believe the Palestinians simply want to eradicate Israel. &quot;The problem is the basic refusal to see a Jewish state,&quot; he said. Few expect Netanyahu to redraw radically his positions on the Palestinians, although some in Israel would like to see a new approach and argue that a peace deal now would better protect Israel&apos;s future. &quot;If he dares to rebel against the right wing and go with Obama, risking a conflict with his partners, Netanyahu could go down in history as having strengthened Israel&apos;s existence in the region,&quot; the left-leaning Ha&apos;aretz newspaper says in an editorial today. &quot;However, if he wraps himself in his fears in an attempt to placate the settlers and their representatives, he will continue to fade from crisis to crisis until he is once again removed from power.&quot; Shimon Shiffer, a prominent political columnist in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, said he did not expect Netanyahu to make any concessions and that he was likely to call on the Palestinians to resume peace talks immediately. &quot;If anyone expected that today he would be the one to announce a freeze on construction in the settlements, his answer will probably be: you must be kidding,&quot; Shiffer writes.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-14T11:34:11Z", "title": "Israel anticipates Netanyahu response to Obama settlement pressure", "sentences": ["The challenge for the prime minister when he speaks at the Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv, will be to find a way to reduce pressure from Washington without breaking up his rightwing coalition."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/14/israel-settlements-binyamin-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Obama administration", "Middle East and North Africa", "US politics"], "article": "In contrast to the drama unfolding on the streets of Iran, the key non-event outside the country is the lack of reaction from the Obama administration. Contrary to the position taken by the Bush administration in cases from the Ukraine to Georgia and Lebanon, there will be no welcoming or encouraging of a velvet revolution in Iran. The Obama administration is, instead, preparing itself to deal with whoever emerges as president. Despite the protestations of Mir-Hossein Mousavi&apos;s supporters, this will almost certainly be the incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. While the United States would have strongly preferred to be dealing with a Mousavi administration, the basic strategic and political rationale for US-Iranian rapprochement remains unchanged. Washington has sensibly avoided directly challenging the validity of an election widely considered by analysts to be seriously flawed. To do otherwise would simply damage the Iranian reform movement further and allow hardliners to once again portray the United States as undermining Iranian sovereignty. US officials have thus adopted a wait-and-see attitude without either congratulating or directly criticising Ahmadinejad&apos;s victory. Iranian law requires a three-day waiting period before the result is officially verified. This established a useful political space for Washington to avoid any detailed response as it is gets to grips with the prospect of another four-year Ahmadinejad administration. Secretary of state Hillary Clinton thus simply stated yesterday: &quot;We, like the rest of the world, are waiting and watching to see what the Iranian people decide.&quot; There are undeniable difficulties now facing Obama&apos;s policy in Iran. The principal effect will be the strengthening of hardline domestic opposition to US engagement. Former Bush official Elliott Abrams was quick to put a dampener on this prospect, stating that it is &quot;likely that the engagement strategy has been dealt a very heavy blow&quot;. The Obama administration, which has in recent times sought to roll back Israeli influence on US policy in Iran, will also face increased pressure from the government in Tel Aviv and its supporters in America. The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, immediately noted the futility of negotiating with any Iranian government led by President Ahmadinejad. He told reporters: &quot;With the results of the election in Iran, the international community must stop a nuclear Iran and Iranian terror immediately. If there was a shadow of hope for change in Iran, the renewed choice of Ahmadinejad expresses more than anything the growing Iranian threat.&quot; On the immediate issue of the linkage between Iran and Israel, Obama will undoubtedly hold the line against an Iran-first approach. There may now, however, be a greater political price for Obama in doing so. The question is whether this cost will jeopardise the prospect of US-Iranian engagement. Many neocons in America and hardliners in Israel will ironically breathe a sigh of relief that their bogeyman remains in power in Tehran. Some were previously open in expressing their hopes that Ahmadinejad, who is an easily identifiable threat, would not be removed from power. These hardliners had greatly feared that a Mousavi victory would simply result in the evaporation of any political will, especially in Europe, to confront Iran&apos;s nuclear activities or support for groups hostile to Israel. Mousavi, they argued with some validity, did not fundamentally propose changing Iran&apos;s position on these issues. There seems little doubt that opponents of US engagement with Iran would have been pushed on the defensive by a Mousavi victory, no more so than on the issue of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. There seems no realistic scenario which doesn&apos;t require America living with Iran being able to enrich uranium sometime in the near future. Preparing the US public for this reality is an inevitable hurdle President Obama will likely have to overcome. Despite there being little evidence that Mousavi would have been able to offer any substantial concessions on this issue, he would have made this realisation slightly more palatable for Americans. It now seems possible that Ahmadinejad&apos;s re-election will strengthen Congressional opposition on this subject. It may also make lawmakers less inclined to provide Tehran incentives, in the form of ending sanctions, for any moderation to its policies. What needs to occur between Iran and the West, and particularly in the United States, is a series of confidence-building measures. Clearly, the last four years have indicated that Ahmadinejad is much less suited than Obama in generating this confidence. The Iranian president is perceived by many as &quot;damaged goods&quot; for his provocative rhetoric on Israel and has shown a very limited interest in improving his political credibility in the west. Yet, despite the obvious sense of disappointment in the west, there are some indications that the Obama administration may be able to capitalise on some of the political implications of Ahmadinejad&apos;s victory. As is often noted, government and the state are not the same in Iran. Events in Iran, and indeed Washington, may well continue to effect a change of attitude in the heart of Iran&apos;s political establishment. If the Supreme Leader has already decided to cautiously pursue rapprochement with the Obama administration \u2013 and several commentators believe he has \u2013 he will receive the support of President Ahmadinejad. Clearly, the Iranian president is not the ideal candidate for extending dialogue, yet his alienation could still turn out to be his virtue. The very hostility of his previous rhetoric on America could elevate the symbolic value of any future conciliatory gestures. Should Ahmadinejad respond magnanimously to any future US overtures, it would portend a much more profound shift in attitude within a section of Iran&apos;s political system often assumed to be implacably hostile. Although some may see the result of these elections as a rejection of Obama&apos;s overtures towards Iran, this is almost certainly not the case. Allegations of vote-rigging aside, it seems accurate to say that domestic issues were more significant in this election. Iran&apos;s foreign policy and particularly its damaged relationship with the US was, however, a hotly debated issue. None of the four candidates stood on a platform that rejected an ongoing constructive dialogue with the Obama administration. Despite the election of a candidate less suited to conducting this dialogue, there remains a broadly popular appetite to end Iran&apos;s international isolation, and repair its relations with America. Positive movement on engagement with the United States could thus be an effective means by which Iran&apos;s political establishment defuses public anger following the disputed election. The issue seems ideally suited to demonstrating that those who yearn for change should not necessarily be disappointed, even if change in political reform will still be resisted. In doing so, the Supreme Leader will be able to take the credit for any rapprochement, while asserting his overall authority on Iran&apos;s decision making process. The west may thus grimace at the prospect of having to deal with Ahmadinejad&apos;s stubborn and provocative style for another four years. Yet, there has not been a seismic shift in the geo-political or political landscape: the foreign policy differences between all four candidates were much more about style than substance. The priorities of the Obama administration are also still the same. Resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict means Iran cannot be pushed to the forefront as the immediate challenge. And in the longer term, the demands on the US from Afghanistan and Central Asia to relations with the wider Islamic world still mean that engagement is the preferred alternative. Irrespective of the outcome of the presidential election in Iran, there is no reason to suggest these will not be potentially effective strategies.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-14T12:12:01Z", "title": "Obama faces reality in Iran | Chris Emery", "sentences": ["The Obama administration, which has in recent times sought to roll back Israeli influence on US policy in Iran, will also face increased pressure from the government in Tel Aviv and its supporters in America."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/14/iran-obama-administration"}, {"tags": ["Banking", "Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "G8", "European Union", "Private equity", "Business", "Paul Myners"], "article": "City minister Paul Myners will visit Stockholm this week to cement an alliance with Sweden in the hope that the two governments can scupper plans made at the weekend&apos;s G8 summit to push ahead with stricter regulation of London&apos;s financial sector. Myners, who is spearheading the government&apos;s resistance to proposed EU regulations governing hedge funds and private equity firms, will meet up with his opposite number Mats Odell, the Swedish minister for local government and financial markets. They are concerned about the &quot;Lecce Framework&quot; put forward by the Italian finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, and named after the southern Italian town that played host to G8 finance ministers at the weekend, including Britain&apos;s Alistair Darling. The framework was put forward as a &quot;set of common principles and standards regarding the conduct of international business and finance&quot;. Details of how the framework will operate have yet to be sketched out, but Tremonti set out five areas where countries should agree international rules: corporate governance, market integrity, tax co-operation, transparency of macro-economic data and policy, and financial regulation and supervision. While ministers publicly welcomed the framework, several EU countries including Britain and Sweden are concerned that Brussels will use the banking crisis as an excuse to clampdown on &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; financial institutions that are deemed to take excessive risks. Plans are already on the table that would shift regulation of markets in equities and derivatives to EU institutions, in effect stripping London of its ability to supervise its own and take account of cultural differences Pan-EU authorities for securities, insurance and banking supervision would have binding powers over member states. industry. Myners has warned that attempts to intervene in the supervision of Britain&apos;s banks will be rebuffed by the Treasury. He has attacked a directive that would clampdown on hedge fund managers, claiming that it would undermine London as Europe&apos;s hedge fund centre. Adair Turner, chairman of the main City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, said at the weekend that he expected a compromise to be found. The plans must be adopted by EU governments and the European parliament to come into force. Germany, France and Italy have already thrown their weight behind the plans, which are due to take effect in 2010. &quot;We believe we will end up with something that is a reasonable way forward,&quot; Turner told Reuters at the annual meeting of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in Tel Avivsaid. &quot;If one was absolutely confident that European supervision was going to be completely politics-free, in a neutral, technocratic fashion, we would be more relaxed about it.&quot; Next month Sweden takes over the presidency of the European Union and is expected to oversee the implementation of Europe-wide regulations to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. Odell was in London last week where he said that neither the hedge fund industry nor private equity could be blamed for the financial crisis. He has put forward plans for a compromise that would leave supervision with individual states other than in exceptional circumstances. He said Britain must concede greater information sharing, while the EU must agree not to use the information unless an emergency warranted intervention.

In a key policy speech intended to address growing US pressure for a move towards peace in the Middle East, Netanyahu defended Israel&apos;s position and said he wanted to make peace, but despite his mention of a Palestinian state he offered few substantial concessions. He praised the Jewish settlers who live in east Jerusalem and on the occupied West Bank and refused US calls for a halt to all settlement growth. He also said Palestinian refugees, who were forced out or fled from their homes during the 1948 war, would not be allowed to return to what is today Israel. Jerusalem, he said, must remain united under Israeli control. &quot;If we receive this guarantee regarding demilitarisation and Israel&apos;s security needs, and if the Palestinians recognise Israel as the state of the Jewish people, we will be ready in a future peace agreement to reach a solution where a demilitarised Palestinian state exists alongside the Jewish state,&quot; Netanyahu told an audience at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. His conditions were strict. He said the Palestinians could not form an army or control their own airspace, or sign military agreements with other states. He mentioned a Palestinian state only once and at other times talked only of areas under Palestinian control, saying the Palestinians could have their own &quot;flag, anthem and administration&quot;. Netanyahu said he would meet any Arab leader to talk about peace and called on the Palestinians to immediately restart peace talks. However a spokesman for the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, rejected his offer. &quot;Netanyahu&apos;s remarks have sabotaged all initiatives, paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the Palestinian, Arab and American positions,&quot; said Nabil Abu Rdainah. &quot;This will not lead to complete and just peace; will not lead to a solution.&quot; He noted particularly the rejection of the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the refusal to allow east Jerusalem to be a capital for a Palestinian state. Netanyahu&apos;s speech comes just days after Barack Obama&apos;s address to the Muslim world in Cairo. Obama&apos;s words for Israel then were clear, calling for a &quot;stop&quot; to Israel&apos;s settlement project. Nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers live in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, even though settlements on occupied land are regarded as illegal under international law. Obama himself said the settlements undermined peace efforts, and noted that the Palestinians had a &quot;legitimate&quot; aspiration for a state of their own. However last night, Washington said Netanyahu&apos;s speech was &quot;an important step forward&quot;, because of the mention of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu said he did not intend to expand the settlements or build new ones, but would allow &quot;normal lives&quot; to continue. This is widely taken to mean that building will continue to accommodate the growth of families, even though this so-called natural growth was to have been frozen under the 2003 US road map for peace. He said Israeli withdrawals from land they had occupied had not brought peace. He had supportive words for the settlers themselves. &quot;Settlers are neither the enemies of the people, nor of peace,&quot; he said. &quot;They are our brothers and sisters. They are Zionists. They have values.&quot; He also challenged assumptions about the cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, insisting it was not down to Israel&apos;s military occupation. &quot;The simple truth is that the root of this conflict has been, and still is, the refusal to accept the right of the Jewish people to have a state of their own,&quot; he said. Palestinian refugees would not be allowed back to Israel. &quot;The refugee problem will find its solution outside the borders of Israel,&quot; he said. Netanyahu said it was a &quot;fundamental condition&quot; to end the conflict that the Palestinians accept Israel as the state of the Jewish people. In 1988 the Palestine Liberation Organisation, as representative of the Palestinian people, formally recognised Israel, but Palestinian leaders have been reluctant to accept the idea of Israel as a Jewish state because it implies giving up the right of return of Palestinian refugees, and leaves unacknowledged the presence of Israel&apos;s Arab citizens, who comprise 20% of the population. In the end, the international community will look for changes in Israeli actions on the ground in the West Bank. Some shacks in a small number of the most distant settlement outposts have been taken down in recent days, and some Israeli checkpoints in the occupied West Bank have been lifted.

Under intense pressure from the White House, Netanyahu publicly endorsed a Palestinian state but conditioned this acceptance on terms the Palestinian leadership will find hard to accept. However, it was the support of the Israeli public and Washington that Netanyahu sought yesterday, not that of the Palestinians. Ever the wily politician, Netanyahu has managed to frame his diplomatic policy in a manner that unifies broad swathes of Israel&apos;s political spectrum while at the same time, to a certain extent, placating the White House. In his own speech at Cairo University, President Obama insisted upon Israeli acceptance of the two-state formula. Netanyahu abstained in the 2003 Israeli cabinet vote endorsing the road map and, for nearly three months since becoming prime minister, has refused to utter the words &quot;Palestinian state&quot; or &quot;two-state solution&quot;. Last night, he finally yielded to Washington&apos;s forceful diplomacy on this matter. Netanyahu explicitly stated that no new settlements would be built and no Palestinian land would be expropriated in the development of the existing ones, although he fell short of declaring a complete halt to construction in the main settlement blocs. At the same time, Netanyahu has positioned himself at the centre of Israeli public opinion, supporting in principle a Palestinian state but with provisos that ensure the recognition of Israel as the Jewish homeland and guarantee its security. Netanyahu&apos;s success in this regard is evidenced by the endorsement of his words which came from the centrist Kadima party, as well as the White House. Kadima&apos;s chairwoman, Tzipi Livni, said that the speech was &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;, while the White House press secretary said &quot;the president welcomes the important step forward in Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s speech&quot;. Despite drawing considerable ire from his party and broader coalition, it seems that Netanyahu has managed to steer a middle path between the opposing demands of the Obama administration and the right-wing of his government. It was surely unrealistic for the White House to expect the prime minister to endorse a Palestinian state, completely freeze all settlement activity, accede to Palestinian demands on the issues of the refugees and Jerusalem while at the same time keeping his coalition intact. The initial reaction of the US administration appears to be a pragmatic acceptance of Netanyahu&apos;s political constraints. And those constraints should not be underestimated. Netanyahu has already been attacked from within the Likud and by other coalition parties. Ayoub Kara, a Likud member of Knesset and deputy minister for the development of the Negev and Galilee, said he would lobby against the recognition of a Palestinian state. Uri Orbach of the Jewish Home party, a member of Netanyahu&apos;s coalition, spoke of the &quot;dangerous consequences&quot; the speech could have. This sceptical political attitude towards the swift formation of a Palestinian state is rooted in the rightward shift of the Israeli public afterthe failure of the 2005 Gaza withdrawal to improve security. The incessant rocket and mortar fire that has struck population centres in southern Israel over the past four years has severely undermined public confidence in the land-for-peace formula and led directly to the ascent of the right-wing parties in February&apos;s elections. Netanyahu, reflecting widespread public concern, pointed out in his speech that Israel is not willing to hand over control of the West Bank only for it to be turned into a launching pad for rocket attacks on Tel Aviv and Haifa. It is these considerations that led him to insist on the acceptance of Israel as the Jewish national homeland and the complete demilitarisation of any future Palestinian state. The reaction to Netanyahu&apos;s address by the Palestinian leadership was much harsher than that of the White House and Netanyahu&apos;s domestic opponents. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that &quot;violence, chaos, extremism and bloodletting&quot; would result, should the US approve Netanyahu&apos;s stance. He went on to say that that the conditions Netanyahu spelt out, such as the refusal to endorse a right of return for Palestinian refugees, would find little support among the Palestinian people. This is almost certainly true, but outright rejection of Netanyahu&apos;s proposal could be a strategic error. It is widely acknowledged that Barack Obama has adopted the most favourable attitude to the Palestinian cause of any US president since Jimmy Carter. Yet even Obama, in his election campaign, has rejected the idea that the Palestinian refugees will return to what is now Israel. And even Carter has acknowledged that settlements, such as those in the Gush Etzion bloc in which new construction is being carried out, will not become part of the Palestinian state. Mahmoud Abbas said in a recent interview that he was simply waiting for the Obama administration to squeeze Palestinian demands out of the Israelis. But if the initial reaction of the White House to Netanyahu&apos;s speech indicates the route which Obama will take, then this stratagem might need rethinking. Netanyahu has made a significant gesture, and the Palestinians may need to offer something in return in order to keep the ball in Israel&apos;s court. In the same interview, Abbas admitted that the previous Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, offered him 97% of the West Bank, a recognition of the right of return and the actual resettlement of thousands of Palestinian refugees inside Israel, yet he still turned the proposal down. Now Abbas has been landed with Netanyahu and such an offer will not come along again soon. If the Palestinian national movement is to make any progress in the near future, some of the more maximalist demands may have to be walked back.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-15T08:42:40Z", "title": "Progress in the peace process | Jeremy Sharon", "sentences": ["Netanyahu, reflecting widespread public concern, pointed out in his speech that Israel is not willing to hand over control of the West Bank only for it to be turned into a launching pad for rocket attacks on Tel Aviv and Haifa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/15/netanyahu-speech-palestine-israel-obama"}, {"tags": ["Football"], "article": "BREAKING NEWS Didier Drogba has been given a six-game European ban, the last two of which are suspended, for his role in the contretemps that followed Chelsea&apos;s Big Cup exit against Barcelona last season.

He had snatched a mobile phone from a young boy and, after a desperate attempt to make a call, collapsed in tears. He then returned the phone to its owner, dragged a dustbin to a nearby tree, climbed on top of it, threw a rope over a branch, placed a noose around his neck and hanged himself. Misghina&apos;s story is typical of the suffering of Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers. Increasing numbers Eritreans have fled their country since President Isaias Afewerki came to power in 1993. Afewerki was initially hailed as a model leader, but is now seen as one of the worst dictators in Africa. Meetings of more than seven people require permission in Eritrea. Internet use is monitored. There is no free press, independent judiciary or political opposition. Citizens, tourists and diplomats require permission to travel from one town to another. Military service conscripts are used as forced labour in development projects and, despite the failure of successive rains and imminent famine, food aid was outlawed in favour of a &quot;work for food&quot; programme, ostensibly designed to promote self-reliance, but which in reality ensures compliance. The suppression of the press and of political opposition in September 2001 provided early indications of the authoritarian nature of the ruling regime. Then, in 2002, the government in effect outlawed every religious practice except Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Lutheranism and Sunni Islam, and increasingly detained practitioners of proscribed religious persuasions indefinitely without trial. Authorised groups face repression. Almost 3,000 of the estimated 20,000 Eritrean prisoners of conscience are Christians, detained pending denial of their faith. The ordained Orthodox patriarch was illegally deposed and placed under house arrest. Catholic property has been seized. About 40 Muslim clerics were indefinitely detained. I have interviewed former prisoners of all faiths and none. They describe a myriad of inhumane punishments, including beatings, rape, people blinded by the sun after months/years imprisoned underground, prisoners bound for so long in contorted positions that limbs atrophy and are amputated, imprisonment in shipping containers, extra-judicial executions, and inadequate food, water and medical treatment. Small wonder that thousands flee, despite a shoot-to-kill policy for escapees. Some pick their way through the mined and patrolled border with Ethiopia. Others cross the Sahara on foot to Sudan, but have found little hope of sanctuary since the country&apos;s rapprochement with Eritrea. Putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers, they try to escape to Libya, where they face severe mistreatment, racial discrimination and harsh detention. Some subsequently cross the Mediterranean in overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels hoping for refuge in Europe, where asylum is far from assured. Others enter Egypt, risking fines for illegal entry, harsh imprisonment and, worse still, forcible return to Eritrea. Those who cross into Israel run into the harsh reality of the modern state, where an anti-infiltration law may soon criminalise asylum seeking, and where they are either imprisoned or forced to live in slums. The search for refuge has resulted in the deaths of an unknown number of Eritreans in the Sahara, the Mediterranean or, like Misghina, through suicide in foreign cities. Human rights organisations recently pointed out that a European Union decision to release development aid to Eritrea is effect an economic lifeline for a repressive regime that will manipulate its distribution. Perhaps the EU would act differently if it considered the increase in the flow of refugees to its borders, and in their appalling suffering en route.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-20T13:00:01Z", "title": "The plight of Eritrean refugees | Khataza Gondwe", "sentences": ["Last week, Abrehale Misghina, a 28-year-old Eritrean refugee, committed suicide in broad daylight in a public park in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/20/eritrea-refugees-misghina"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Science", "Medical research", "People in science"], "article": "The celebrated scientist Ephraim Katzir, who has died aged 93, was Israel&apos;s fourth head of state, and his presidency was distinguished by extraordinary highs and lows. He had only held office for four months when Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked Israel without warning, on 6 October 1973. Katzir reassured a shocked nation and quelled recriminations following the resultant, bloody, Yom Kippur war. In April 1974, he accepted the forced resignation of the prime minister Golda Meir, yet admitted &quot;we are all to blame&quot; for prewar hubris.  Katzir often bore the brunt of public ire. In May 1974 he was booed at a funeral for 20 teenagers killed by a Palestinian raid on the northern town of Ma&apos;alot. Three years later, he received another jolt when the Likud party won power for the first time. A Labour nominee, Katzir then had to represent a government whose ethos differed markedly from his own. By contrast, during Katzir&apos;s last year in office he played host to Egypt&apos;s president Anwar Sadat - the first such visit to Israel by any Arab leader, and a considerably more joyous Egyptian &quot;invasion&quot; than that of 1973. Sadat called Katzir &quot;an excellent man&quot; in his memoirs. Katzir encouraged the foundation of Jewish studies departments in overseas universities. Innovative and caring at home, if somewhat low-key and modest, he visited families in distress and instituted awards for volunteerism. Katzir turned down a proffered second term as president in 1978 and eagerly resumed his academic career. In 2001 he co-edited a book on conformational diseases and, as late as May 2004, aged 88, he was still chairing sessions at scientific conferences. He was born Ephraim Katchalsky in Kiev, then in Tsarist Russian Ukraine, and formally hebraicised his surname to Katzir when he became president. He grew up in Jerusalem having arrived in Mandate Palestine in 1922 with his family. He studied biology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1932, received his PhD degree there in 1941 and later carried out postgraduate research at Harvard and Columbia universities. Both he and his elder brother, Aharon, a molecular chemist, were steeped in the values of Labour Zionism. They served in the pre-state militia, the Haganah, for which they developed crude explosives. Immediately after Israel declared its independence, in May 1948, Ephraim returned home from research abroad. He was appointed commander of the science corps of the new Israel Defence Forces (IDF), which allegedly built chemical weapons. When war ceased in 1949, Katzir founded and became head of the department of biophysics and professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He deepened understanding of the genetic code and immune responses; pioneered research into poly-amino acids; did seminal work on synthetic protein models; helped develop Copaxone, a drug that combats multiple sclerosis; and invented a naturally dissoluble synthetic fibre for stitching internal wounds. In time, he was respected internationally as a founder of biotechnology. To Katzir, science was no mere esoteric pursuit, but a priceless national asset. In 1966 he became Israel&apos;s first chief scientist of the IDF, a post he held for three years. He encouraged increased state funding of scientific research in industry and agriculture, championed educational facilities in Israel&apos;s poorer towns, and wrote and lectured widely on the moral responsibility that scientists owe society. His brother Aharon became a pioneer of biopolymer electrochemistry (used in robotics in outer space) and a leading consultant to Israel&apos;s secret nuclear project. Once mooted as a future state president himself, in May 1972 he was killed by Japanese Red Army terrorists at Israel&apos;s Lod airport. Ephraim led a US team on a famous 1961 inspection of the nuclear plant in Dimona. Though critics blamed him for misleading the Americans about its weapons capability, in 1974 he let slip that &quot;it has always been our intention to develop a nuclear potential - we now have that potential.&quot; Occasionally, the loyal civil servant expressed political qualms. In 1989, during the first intifada, Katzir told one interviewer: &quot;The Zionist dream was not to create a Jewish state in which Arabs are beaten up; our dream was to have a state of which the Jewish people could be proud.&quot; Katzir&apos;s post-presidency years were amazingly active. He helped to create Tel Aviv University&apos;s biotechnology department, wrote hundreds of learned papers and tirelessly promoted younger scholars. He received the Japan prize for work on immobilised enzymes in oral antibiotics in 1985, and the French L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur in 1990. A foreign member of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution, Katzir was the first Israeli to enter the US National Academy of Sciences.  At 22 he had married Nina Gottlieb, a Polish-born English teacher; she died in 1986. Two daughters also predeceased Katzir, who is survived by his son, Meir, and three grandchildren. \u2022 Ephraim Katzir (Katchalsky), biochemist and politician, born 16 May 1916; died 30 May 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-06-21T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Ephraim Katzir", "sentences": ["He helped to create Tel Aviv University&apos;s biotechnology department, wrote hundreds of learned papers and tirelessly promoted younger scholars."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/ephraim-katzir-obituary-scientist-president"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Race issues", "World news"], "article": "It&apos;s one thing for a bar or club to employ a dress code for sartorial reasons, quite another to exclude law-abiding citizens simply because of their adherence to civic duty. In a country such as Israel, where national service is compulsory, to ban soldiers in uniform from entering a pub is to tread on shaky ground. Yet that is what the owners of the Rogatka bar in Tel Aviv have decided upon, tarring all IDF personnel with the same dismissive brush. To declare anyone decked out in olive-green uniform as persona non grata is a step too far, regardless of the justifications offered by the anarchist collective running the bar. The response given by one of the proprietors, Adi Vinter, is that &quot;We can&apos;t hold views against discrimination and oppression, while at the same time supporting the infrastructure that exploits human beings and other animals&quot;. The sentiment may be admirable, but to extrapolate it into a ban on uniformed soldiers makes little sense: first because \u2013 according to Vinter&apos;s own logic \u2013 she and her friends shouldn&apos;t be doing business inside Israel at all. To pay tax, whether as a company or individual, in Israel is to &quot;support [an] infrastructure that exploits human beings&quot; in the eyes of the hard-left. Singling out serving soldiers as the only people responsible for the injustices perpetrated by the state is a weak way for the anarchists to make their point. If the ban is ideological in intent, half-measures are not the answer: anyone deemed part of the &quot;infrastructure of exploitation&quot; should be excluded from the bar, and the criteria ought to be less simplistic than judging potential drinkers by the colour of their clothes. At the same time, if the anti-IDF posturing is to be maintained, then allowing soldiers into the bar if they&apos;ve changed out of uniform and left their guns at home is fudging the issue. Anyone employed by the army \u2013 whether in compulsory service, a career position, or an active reservist \u2013 should be vetted on the strength of their CV, rather than just their outward appearance. Of course, none of the above will happen; the ban is far more superficial than that. Instead, simply refusing to allow uniforms or weapons on the premises allows the owners and regulars to drink, and discuss politics, in an entirely homogenous and holier-than-thou atmosphere. According to Ha&apos;aretz, &quot;the founders ... hope it will bring together leftwing activists, environmentalists, and other fellow travellers, under the banner of cheap drinks and fair trade products&quot;. In order to protect their own interests and save themselves from having to encounter people who might hold differing opinions to theirs, they believe in a policy of denying entry on the most insincere grounds. What begins with IDF staff could, conceivably, extend as far as those running the establishment desire. While it might seem attractive to ban uniformed soldiers to the type of drinkers that Vinter and her friends hope frequent the bar, they would no doubt be up in arms were the same policies applied in reverse. Bars refusing entry to anyone with dreadlocks or dyed hair would have them screaming for equal rights, as would discrimination on ethnic lines. Yet, according to their own approach, drinkers in ultra-orthodox garb could be banned on the basis of their belief in a patriarchal, conservative ideology \u2013 whether Jewish, Muslim, or Christian. The Rogatka bar isn&apos;t a primary school; IDF employees aren&apos;t by definition fascists \u2013 so the owners shouldn&apos;t be assuming the mantle of Ed Balls and his advisers. While there would of course be grounds for kicking out anyone walking in with a swastika tattoo, a Kach fist t-shirt or a Hamas headscarf, to imply that every member of the IDF is a de facto racist is completely unacceptable. In Jaffa, where tensions often run high between soldiers and locals, the Arab-owned restaurants still teem with uniformed IDF staff at all hours of the day, the proprietors recognising that not all soldiers are evil, and that they should therefore be judged on an individual basis. The owners of Rogatka could learn a great deal from such an approach, rather than loftily applying their illogical blanket ban to their own establishment.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-22T13:00:00Z", "title": "A phoney war on Israel's soldiers | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Yet that is what the owners of the Rogatka bar in Tel Aviv have decided upon, tarring all IDF personnel with the same dismissive brush."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/22/israel-bar-ban-idf"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "Dressed in jeans and a tight headscarf, she stood in a makeshift courtroom with plastic chairs and \u00adtables and a television set hanging from the wall. She barely said a word. At the moment of sentencing, when the chief military judge in the Palestinian city of Jenin jailed her for 20 years&apos; hard labour, Taghrid al-Tibi held one hand to her face in shock and sadness. Then she was led away. Divorced, unemployed and only 21 years old, she was one of the few Palestinian women convicted of treason. Her crime: collaboration with the Israeli security services. Hers is a grim story of an unhappy life and naivety. Enticed out of the occupied West Bank and into Israel, then plunged into a high-risk spying effort that lasted for five months until her capture, Tibi was lucky to escape with her life: collaborators, who are nearly always men, are so reviled among Palestinians that many are either shot in the street or sentenced to years on death row. She did not speak to journalists after her hearing last week, but accounts from prosecutors involved in her case paint a scattered picture of Tibi&apos;s life. Originally from Tulkarem, she was living with her family in Nablus, in the north of the occupied West Bank. She attended school until the age of 16 but then her father ordered her to marry an older man. It was an unhappy marriage: she told the court that he had forced her into prostitution. Within a few years she was divorced and increasingly cut off from her family. Several months ago Tibi met an Arab-Israeli in Nablus, named Mahmoud, who persuaded her to join him on a trip back into Israel. She agreed, though it should perhaps have raised her suspicions when he arranged a rare permit for her to leave the West Bank. The couple slept together and then he took her to an office in Tel Aviv, where Israeli security service agents apparently confronted her with a video of her in bed with the man, the prosecutors said. They threatened to pass the video back to her family unless she helped them and also apparently promised her 100,000 shekels (\u00a315,500) if she would pass them regular information about a group of militants in Nablus. She told her story in a six-page signed affidavit for the prosecutors. It began with her name, date of birth and her background. Then she said: &quot;Five months ago I met this guy, Mahmoud, I didn&apos;t know his full name. He was working inside the Green Line [within Israel]. I sat with him a couple of times in the park. He took me on a visit. We went to Tel Aviv. Inside the offices there was an Israeli commander and he knew everything about me. &quot;He asked me to relax for an hour and then he said he wanted me to give him information on 10 wanted men in exchange for 100,000 shekels.&quot; She returned to Nablus and for five months she spent time with several \u00admilitants, men she knew only by the pseudonyms they used to protect their identity. She would regularly head out to the Israeli military checkpoint at Hawara, on the southern edge of the city, and pass on information to an Israeli contact. However, she learned little about the militants or their activities and her information was always of little value, the prosecutors said. None of the militants she met were arrested or killed. Eventually the militants became suspicious of her questions. They confronted her, she confessed and then in May they handed her over to the Palestinian authorities in Nablus. At the end of the affidavit, she was asked if she wanted to add anything to her statement. Tibi answered: &quot;I&apos;m really sorry for what I&apos;ve done but I&apos;m glad that I haven&apos;t been the reason for anybody getting hurt.&quot; Tibi&apos;s case was passed to the military court and Major Alam Dalbeh, the military prosecutor in Jenin, sat with her in his second-floor office for an interrogation. She volunteered the entire story, he said. &quot;Her father married her off when she was 16 and her husband was corrupt and immoral,&quot; said Dalbeh. &quot;All these things contributed to her becoming a collaborator, but the law is the law. Still, it was very hard for us to question her. She confessed very fast, faster than in any other case like this that I&apos;ve dealt with before. She was very sad. She kept saying: &apos;I&apos;m sorry. I won&apos;t do it again.&apos; She said: &apos;I&apos;m a victim of my father and my husband.&apos;&quot; She was offered the chance to hire a lawyer to defend herself, but refused and was given a court lawyer. None of her family appeared at court for the hearing. Prosecutors said her sentence of hard labour meant she faced years of menial tasks inside the jail, mostly cleaning and washing. She may have to serve the full 20 years, although it is more likely that she will be pardoned well before her sentence ends \u2013 the Palestinian president has the authority to pardon prisoners and often does so, usually on religious holidays. However, since collaboration is such a reviled crime in Palestinian society and given that her family appears to have disowned her, she is likely to face another challenge in finding a place in society when she is eventually freed. Dalbeh, who has prosecuted other collaborators in the past, said the crime was seen as &quot;very disgraceful&quot; in Palestinian society. &quot;Many members of the resistance have been killed or arrested in the past because of collaborators, because of people like her. We are in the stage of building a Palestinian state and such collaborators are affecting the establishment of the state,&quot; he said. Other cases had also involved sexual entrapment, Dalbeh said, or the promises of permits to enter Israel or visas to live in countries abroad. &quot;Their tricks are very well known to us,&quot; he said. &quot;They used her like a slice of lemon,&quot; said Mohammad Hamashe, another prosecutor. &quot;They squeezed the juice out of her and then threw her away with the rubbish.&quot; At a glance According to B&apos;Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, 26 Palestinians have been sentenced for crimes of treason or collaborating since the Palestinian Authority was established in 1994. Some prisoners have escaped or died in jail, others have had their sentences commuted by the president. B&apos;Tselem&apos;s figures show only one execution for treason \u2013 that of a 27-year-old man from Rafah, Gaza, who was killed in January 2001 at the beginning of the second intifada, the most recent Palestinian uprising. But the statistics do not tell the whole story. Many collaborators are rounded up before they reach court and shot in the street by militants. Nearly all have been men.

Barak is expected to propose a temporary and partial freeze on the construction of homes for Jews in the West Bank. That falls far short of Barack Obama&apos;s demand made to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at a difficult meeting in Washington last month for a complete halt to building as evidence of a commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu has recognised Obama&apos;s stance by, for the first time, acknowledging there should be an independent Palestine, albeit with conditions, and agreeing to lift some military checkpoints that restrict movement on the West Bank. But he has resisted pressure to end settlement construction which remains a sensitive issue among his rightwing coalition partners. Shortly before heading to Washington, Barak acknowledged that as defence minister he has recently authorised fresh construction and legalised previously unauthorised building in some settlements. Six Israeli cabinet ministers, including Netanyahu, Barak and the hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, met today to discuss Washington&apos;s demand for an end to expansion of the settlements which house about 500,000 Israelis, and a similar call made by the Quartet of Middle East mediators made up of the US, EU, Russia and the UN. Tel Aviv newspapers reported Israeli officials as saying that Barak would meet Obama&apos;s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, in New York tomorrow to propose a three-month freeze on construction in settlements outside Jerusalem. But he wants the US to agree that Israel can continue construction in occupied East Jerusalem and finish building homes under way for 10,000 more Israelis to live in the West Bank. That is likely to remain a major obstacle as Israel is using its rapid construction programme to surround Jerusalem with Jewish housing and separate Arab districts from the rest of the occupied territories. If construction work continues it is not only likely to surround Jerusalem with Israeli housing but result in a Jewish majority in the east of the city which Israel would use to buttress its claim over all of Jerusalem at peace talks. Relations have also soured over Israel&apos;s insistence that it had an &quot;understanding&quot; with George Bush&apos;s administration that allowed what it calls &quot;natural growth&quot; of the settlements to build housing for the children of settlers. Israel&apos;s intelligence minister, Dan Meridor, said today that the oral commitment qualified a written agreement with the Americans that required a complete halt to construction. &quot;These understandings were a part of the agreement. Its written part and its oral part complement each other,&quot; he said. Israel says it is free to build as it wants in Jerusalem because it has sovereignty over the entire city. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has disavowed the agreement and reiterated that all settlement construction has to stop, including in East Jerusalem. American officials say they do not feel bound by tacit deals not made in writing. Barak is also expected to tell the Americans that the limited construction freeze must be tied to Palestinian peace efforts and moves by the rest of the Arab world to recognise Israel. Even while proposing a partial construction freeze, Barak is also authorising new building. Last week he acknowledged retroactively legalising 60 flats built without government approval near the Jewish settlement of Talmon. He has also given the go-ahead for the construction of scores of new homes in another settlement. Barak told the New York Times that the settlement issue should not be treated in isolation and made the most important issue, but must be considered in the context of wider peace negotiations. Sources close to the US administration say that some Obama officials are also concerned at getting bogged down in a dispute over the settlements but for different reasons. They fear that the Israelis will use a protracted disagreement to slow down movement on a broader peace initiative. For that reason, some Obama advisers are pressing for several tracks to be pursued at once, including direct negotiationsnot dependent on each other at this stage. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, today said that greater political resolve in the US and other parts of the world presented &quot;a unique opportunity to achieve a comprehensive peace. &quot;Under the road map, Israel agreed to implement a comprehensive freeze on all settlement activity, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem. &quot;This includes all &apos;natural growth&apos;. The decisions the Israeli government makes will determine how genuine Israel&apos;s commitment to peace is,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-30T17:13:00Z", "title": "Israel expected to propose a temporary and partial freeze on the construction of new homes in the West Bank", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv newspapers reported Israeli officials as saying that Barak would meet Obama&apos;s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, in New York tomorrow to propose a three-month freeze on construction in settlements outside Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/29/settlements-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Judaism", "Religion"], "article": "Police in Jerusalem were preparing for fierce clashes tomrrow, as ultra-orthodox Jewish demonstrators threatened to escalate protests over a car park, which they say desecrates the Sabbath. The religious protesters have hurled rocks, set fire to rubbish bins and denounced the police as &quot;Nazis&quot; who would &quot;burn in hell&quot; during demonstrations over the past few weeks against the city council&apos;s decision to provide free municipal parking near Jerusalem&apos;s Old City for tourists on Saturdays. Protesters have blocked roads and disrupted traffic, while the city&apos;s secular mayor, Nir Barkat, has received death threats, according to a police spokesman. A few weeks ago, the controversy attracted 30,000 ultra-orthodox residents to pray in protest at the new car park. The weekend before last saw 57 people arrested, most of whom were subsequently released, although a number have been charged with assault. The row has also prompted counter-demonstrations from secular residents urging Barkat not to cave in to &quot;religious coercion&quot;. The ultra-orthodox sector \u2013 also called &quot;Haredi&quot; or God-fearing \u2013 adheres to strict religious codes, of which observing the Sabbath is a central tenet. They view the decision to open a municipal parking lot as a move that sanctions driving, and indirectly promotes trading on Saturdays \u2013 both forbidden according to ultra-orthodox practice \u2013 and hence considers it to be a city-wide cancellation of the Sabbath. &quot;Our struggle is not over a car park, but about the character of Jerusalem,&quot; said Shmuel Poppenheim, of the ultra-religious Eda Haredit group, which has organised most of the protests. &quot;If the mayor decides today that he can open a car park on a Saturday, who knows what he will decide to do tomorrow.&quot; City council representatives have said that the decision to open the parking lot was in response to a chronic shortage of weekend parking. The new car park was approved, officials say, in response to police reports that increasing numbers of tourists and day-trippers were depositing dangerously parked cars around the Old City. Barkat, who was elected mayor last November, sees attracting tourism as part of his economic growth plan for the city, where the usually low-income ultra-orthodox sector is expected to form the majority of the Jewish population within the next decade. The car-park clashes are seen to represent a stand-off between the mayor and Jerusalem&apos;s growing ultra-religious community. Members of this sector have said that the issue is a &quot;cultural war&quot;, through which Barkat seeks to turn Jerusalem into another Tel Aviv \u2013 where numerous businesses, including shops, cafes and car parks, remain open on Saturdays.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-07T17:13:26Z", "title": "Jersualem braces for protests over car park open on Saturdays", "sentences": ["Members of this sector have said that the issue is a &quot;cultural war&quot;, through which Barkat seeks to turn Jerusalem into another Tel Aviv \u2013 where numerous businesses, including shops, cafes and car parks, remain open on Saturdays."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/07/jerusalem-car-park-sabbath"}, {"tags": ["Women", "Life and style", "Exhibitions", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 13 July 2009 The article below referred to outrage expressed by 1980s activists in New York that while only 5% of the artists in the Museum of Modern Art were women, 85% of the nudes were female. That should have been the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1989, a group of women plastered posters across New York. &quot;Do women have to be naked to get into the Met?&quot;, the slogan asked. The Guerrilla Girls, as the activists were known, were outraged that while only 5% of the artists in the Museum of Modern Art were women, 85% of the nudes were female. Twenty years on, these posters are not just being exhibited inside a national museum - they are part of the largest all-female showcase in contemporary art to date, one that might finally show the art world what it has been missing. It is the first time the Pompidou Centre in Paris has displayed its new permanent collection of female painters, photographers, designers, architects, sculptors, performance artists and film-makers. After decades of excluding women from its major shows, elles@pompidou is an enormous visual manifesto for the institution, proving its commitment to putting female artists at the core of modern and contemporary art. Among the 200 artists taking part are heavyweights such as role-playing photographer Cindy Sherman, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, who last year filled Tate Modern&apos;s vast turbine hall with 200 bunk beds; and Roni Horn, whose series of photographs of a pale-faced woman (You Are the Weather) were the stars of her solo show there in London earlier this year.  This exhibition would have been impossible to mount even five years ago, according to curator Camille Morineau - the museum simply did not have enough work by women. This, she admits, was partly due to a lack of interest by former curators. But thanks to an attitude change at the Pompidou, 40% of its art by women was bought within the last four years and none of it has been borrowed from other galleries. &quot;We&apos;ve been buying more female artists,&quot; she says. &quot;There hasn&apos;t been an open discussion about it, but my associate curators and I have a similar and particular vision of the world - more so than people in the art world from an older generation.&quot; Only a short walk away, another Parisian landmark offers a reminder of how unusual Morineau&apos;s attitude is. The Louvre holds 35,000 artworks, and is the most visited museum in the world, but currently has no female artists in its collection. As a museum that deals with older art this is perhaps unsurprising, but the museum has held short exhibitions that included female painters such as early 20th-century artist Marie D&apos;Orleans.  In the UK, the National Gallery has just four paintings by two female artists among its 2,300 works on show. The trustees of the the Tate Modern, which deals with contemporary and modern art, admit that women make up only 12% of its entire collection. By contrast, the sheer scale of the Pompidou&apos;s collection of art by women is impressive - it has 500 pieces. There is also a dedicated website, lecture programmes and catalogue. However, Morineau says that getting an all-female show off the ground wasn&apos;t easy: &quot;There is a fear over isolating a group - women - but to me that creates a barrier.&quot;  In the UK, major recent exhibitions of art by women have either featured work by individuals or group exhibitions specifically addressing gender. For instance Bad Girls, the last all-female exhibition at a big gallery, was held in 1994 at the ICA, and in it artists responded to the idea of women as passive objects. By contrast, the Pompidou collection&apos;s pamphlet insists the art &quot;is neither female nor feminist in its point of view&quot;. The collection solidly covers artistic movements that would be included in any major contemporary survey - minimalism, surrealism and abstraction - seeking to redress the gender imbalance in the art world. Morineau thinks the collection has already made its point, &quot;Nobody thought about [the lack of women in] the Louvre, and now they are starting to talk about it.&quot; The show&apos;s diversity is staggering: seven themes track individually titled rooms across two floors. In Family and Relationships, there are simple, diary-style drawings by Louise Bourgeois, whose gigantic sculpture, Spider, has travelled the world, and cartoon-like creations by Anne Marie Schneider. Close by is Semiotics of the Kitchen, a dry video by artist Martha Rosler, featuring her standing and speaking in her kitchen. Elsewhere, photographs taken in New York by Diane Arbus and Lisette Model (who taught Arbus) are placed side by side, their familiarity not detracting from the originality of the shots. Frida Kahlo&apos;s The Frame, the much reproduced, and in real life relatively small, self-portrait is one of the star exhibits and hangs alone on a red partition wall. The rooms that house these artists are on the upper floor of the exhibition and are separated from the rest of the modern collection by entrances painted in fluorescent orange. This allows male artists such as Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Man Ray to be shown close to female collections. Val\u00e9rie Belin, whose hyper-real portraits of mannequins are on display, says the collection proves it is unimportant whether an artist is male or female. &quot;The real value of this show is that the gender difference is not perceived at all.&quot; As Annette Messager, whose work was seen in the Hayward gallery in London, in May, notes: &quot;I don&apos;t like &apos;ghettoes&apos;, but it seems important to show that the Pompidou Centre has actually bought quite a lot of women artists&apos; work. It&apos;s an example to other museums.&quot;  Not all the artists agree that there is no such thing as female art, and the show has critics within its ranks. Sigalit Landau&apos;s uncomfortable video Barbed Hula, which shows her amassing scars as she hula-hoops with barbed wire on a Tel Aviv beach, shares a room with Messager&apos;s Les Piques, a collection of more than 100 pikes on which are impaled soft toys, photographs, and drawings. Landau says, &quot;There is such a thing as woman art. And I&apos;m not sure having it all together in one place is right for today. It is a touch artificial, and maybe creates an imbalanced experience.&quot; But Morineau argues that a more explosive statement was necessary: &quot;We needed a violent gesture, something a little dramatic.&quot; The gesture, it seems, has already inspired the Museum of Modern Art. Morineau says the New York institution was initially sceptical of elles@pompidou, but it is now working on a new publication, Individuals: Women artists in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. After its release next year, it will also focus on some of its own women artists, with each curatorial department devoting a significant portion, and in some cases all, of its collection galleries to them. As for the Guerrilla Girls, whose poster has a prominent position in the Pompidou exhibition, they say more must be done by the art world. K\u00e4the Kollwitz (who, like all the activists takes her pseudonym from a dead female artist) says it is time for British institutions to take up the challenge. &quot;The Pompidou, like many other museums, is known for its under-representation of women artists. Now, for one year, they are representing them. Does this make up for all those years of discrimination? No. The pressure is on for the Tate Modern.&quot; \u2022 The women&apos;s page now has space for your comments. Do you think female artists have been ignored by the art world?

The 74-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter announced he would perform in Tel Aviv as part of his world tour. The Ramallah date was added later, allegedly in response to pro-Palestinian campaigners who had tried to dissuade Cohen from appearing in Israel. Now his Palestinian hosts have cancelled the West Bank concert, amid claims that the planned gig was a hollow attempt to &quot;balance&quot; performances. &quot;Ramallah will not receive Cohen as long as he is intent on whitewashing Israel&apos;s colonial apartheid regime by performing in Israel,&quot; the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) said in a statement. The campaign was launched in Ramallah in 2004 and calls for an international academic and cultural boycott of Israel. Cohen, who is not believed to have a large fanbase in the West Bank, was scheduled to play at the 736-seat Ramallah Cultural Palace, a day after appearing at the 55,000 capacity Ramat Gan stadium, near Tel Aviv. The Ramallah event was to be hosted by the Palestinian prisoners&apos; club and attended by families of some of the 11,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails of detention centres. Israeli fans are concerned that the sale of tickets for Cohen&apos;s performance in Ramat Gan has been postponed three times and the concert date does not appear on his official website. Some campaigners have expressed criticism at the cancellation of the West Bank gig, describing it as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; for the high-profile singer to bring awareness to the Palestinian cause. But one poster to an internet discussion described the cancellation as good news for Palestine because Cohen&apos;s music is &quot;dreary and dreadful&quot;. Cohen, whose singing career spans four decades, performed in Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur war, when he flew in to play for Israeli soldiers fighting in the Sinai desert.

His life depended upon his ability to reduce other boxers to a bloody pulp. Had he not done so, he would have met the fate shared by more than 200 of his opponents, and been summarily shot or despatched to the gas chambers. The murder of his family, and the urge to tell the rest of the world what had happened to them, gave him this extraordinary, troubling variant on\u00a0the will to survive. Arouch was a Sephardic Jew whose dock-worker father encouraged his son&apos;s middleweight boxing. His footwork brought him the nickname &quot;the Ballet Dancer&quot;, a potential place in the Greek Olympic team and middleweight supremacy in the Balkans. But in 1943, the Germans invaded Greece, and Arouch&apos;s family were among those rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. His mother and sisters were in the group sent first. Spotting a friend when he arrived, Arouch asked: &quot;Where are the others?&quot; When told that they were dead, all gassed and burned, he refused to believe him, believing the man to be crazy. His forearm duly tattooed with the number 136954, Arouch soon learned that the horrors were real. At\u00a0one assembly of the prisoners, a\u00a0German officer demanded to know whether any were boxers. Arouch hung back but was pushed forward by friends. So began twice-weekly warehouse bouts, often preceded by Gypsy juggling and dancing dogs, while officers staked their bets. Arouch faced up to prisoners who were often bigger than him, knowing that he had to keep on going. His status as a fighter brought him clerical and kitchen work, and a reprieve from the gas chambers. Perhaps the closest that he came to death was at the hands of a professional boxer named Klaus Silber, who, far heavier than his opponent, almost knocked him out. Both tumbled from the ring before recovering. Arouch was the victor, and\u00a0Silber vanished forever. As Primo Levi wrote of the camp in If This Is a Man: &quot;The Greeks have been reduced to very few by now, but they have made a contribution of the first importance to the physiognomy of the camp and to the international slang in circulation. These few survivors from the Jewish colony of Salonika, with their two languages, Spanish and Greek, and their numerous activities, are the repositories of a concrete, mundane, conscious wisdom in which the traditions of all the Mediterranean civilisations blend together. &quot;That this wisdom was transformed in the camp into the systematic and scientific practice of theft and seizure of possessions and the monopoly of the bargaining market, should not make one forget their aversion to gratuitous brutality, their amazing consciousness of the survival of at least a potential human dignity.&quot; Arouch&apos;s father and brother did not survive the war. His father was executed when he became ill, and his brother was\u00a0shot for refusing to extract gold from the teeth of the gassed. After liberation early in 1945, Arouch visited other camps to look for his family. At\u00a0Belsen he met 17-year-old Marta Yechiel, also from Salonika, and sole survivor of her family. They married in November and moved to Palestine, where Arouch took part in the 1948 war, and the couple settled in the new state of Israel. Later he developed a shipping and moving business in Tel Aviv. In 1988 he returned to Auschwitz for three months, as an adviser on Triumph of the Spirit (1989), the film based on his life, in which he was played by Willem Dafoe. Directed by Robert Young, this film was the first to be shot on location there. Nobody, from the armchair of hindsight, can know what they would have done in\u00a0Arouch&apos;s place.

And rightly so: there is no excuse for the effects of the violent and bloody conflict raging in the region to be trivialised in such a fashion, nor for the psychological impact of Qassam attacks on the residents of southern Israel to be so cynically ignored. Yet that is exactly what one of Israel&apos;s largest phone companies has done, albeit in reverse, with their grotesque advertising campaign centring on the separation wall which snakes through the West Bank. Their 50-second long commercial debuted on Israeli screens in the same week that the fifth anniversary of the ICJ ruling declaring the wall illegal was reached, adding insult to the injury caused by the content of the commercial itself. The advert begins with a football sailing over the barrier and landing on a military jeep on the Israeli side of the de facto border, prompting a brief moment of panic among the troops, before they realise it is a harmless object. They decide to kick it back over the wall, then \u2013 when the ball flies back over to them once more \u2013 realise they have a game on their hands, and call up reinforcements to join in the kickabout. With jeepfuls of soldiers turning up to cheer on the players, the carnival atmosphere is summed up by a jaunty voiceover: &quot;After all, what are we all after? Just a little fun.&quot; With that, the message is rammed home loud and clear: in a militarised version of a Cyndi Lauper number, we learn that troops just wanna have fun, whether at home, on the beach, or patrolling a stretch of one of the most contentious walls on earth. In Cellcom&apos;s eyes, as bloggers have observed, even the most tragic and traumatic experiences of an entire people can be harnessed to the selling of mobile phone services. That the wall is detested by millions of Palestinians, has been ruled wholly illegal by an international court, and has been proved to be a tool for blatant and brazen theft of Palestinian land is neither here nor there; at least, not when there&apos;s a cheap laugh to be had and an in-joke to be shared with the company&apos;s target audience. As Haaretz reported, Ahmed Tibi, an Arab member of the Knesset, demanded Cellcom pull the advert immediately:  &quot;The barrier separates families and prevents children from reaching schools and clinics, yet the advertisement presents the barrier as though it were just a garden fence in Tel Aviv.&quot;  His outrage was echoed by hundreds of protesting voices, both inside and outside Israel, yet Cellcom remained defiant in the face of their critics. According to a company spokesman, the commercial illustrated the potential for people of different ethnic and political persuasions to engage in &quot;mutual entertainment&quot;. If the brief they gave the McCann Erickson agency when commissioning the campaign was along those lines, there would have been far less offensive and obnoxious ways to make such a point \u2013 but it&apos;s doubtful that was Cellcom&apos;s intention at all. After all, the target audience \u2013 as with most phone companies in Israel \u2013 is teenaged soldiers doing their spell of compulsory service; and tact and diplomacy rank a distant second to ribald and vulgar humour when appealing to this demographic. Cellcom can&apos;t have been under any illusions as to what would happen when the advert hit TV screens; they must, therefore, have decided that the inevitable outcry would be far outweighed by the upsurge in their popularity among Israeli troops. To some Israelis, the wall is a national disgrace; to others, it is a necessary evil; to others still, it is a symbol of strength and security for every citizen of the state. But even those ardent supporters of its construction should, it would be hoped, realise that the wall is loathed on the Palestinian side of the divide, and that turning it into a laughing matter as a way of selling phones is beyond the pale. Yet if Cellcom&apos;s reaction is anything to go by, with its assumption that Israelis will find their advert funny, there is a long way to go before empathy is applied to those forever trapped behind the concrete slabs of the separation barrier. Just as Israelis demand the world pays heed to the plight of its own citizens during times of war and terror, so too should firms such as Cellcom and individual Israelis pay the same respect to their Palestinian neighbours. Such actions would do far more to bring about Cellcom&apos;s grandiose goal of interracial peace and harmony than any amount of wall-volleyball ever could.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-20T09:00:00Z", "title": "Cellcom's cynical commercial | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["As Haaretz reported, Ahmed Tibi, an Arab member of the Knesset, demanded Cellcom pull the advert immediately:  &quot;The barrier separates families and prevents children from reaching schools and clinics, yet the advertisement presents the barrier as though it were just a garden fence in Tel Aviv.&quot;  His outrage was echoed by hundreds of protesting voices, both inside and outside Israel, yet Cellcom remained defiant in the face of their critics."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/20/cellcom-advert-israel-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Denmark", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Europe"], "article": "There will be triathlon and handball \u2013 but also bridge and line dancing. Copenhagen is preparing for thousands of gay people from dozens of nations to descend this weekend for the Outgames, a nine-day sporting and cultural olympics for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. When the 5,500 participants are introduced on a catwalk in Copenhagen&apos;s central square today, it will kickstart nine days of sport, arts and political debates with almost 100 nations represented in more than 30 events, traditional and improvised. But the event is about much more than podium places. The Outgames has launched itself under the banner of sport, culture and human rights. Participants from a host of cities, including Tel Aviv and Mexico City, will take over public spaces throughout Copenhagen to showcase artists and performers. At the centre of the political programme is a human rights conference, where speakers include the British basketball player and sports commentator John Amaechi, the first NBA player to have come out. On the fringe of the games, the people of Copenhagen have been encouraged to embrace the event and play an active role.

There was a stag do in Tel Aviv, in which \u2013 for a dare apparently \u2013 he was photographed in the kind of stretched T-shirt and skimpy shorts that would not have looked out of place alongside Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s Bruno. Then there was a private jet to the Caribbean to marry his long-time girlfriend, Rebecca Ellison, and at the start of the month an interview with Roger Federer for his online magazine #5. Now, Ferdinand is sitting in the dining room of one of Seoul&apos;s many grand but anonymous hotels contemplating the long months ahead during United&apos;s pre-season tour. He couldn&apos;t begin to tell you what the South Korean capital is like. There is a Herm\u00e8s store in the hotel complex and Louis Vuitton is coming soon but that is as far as most footballers will get. &quot;All I have seen is the hotel, the bus and the pitch,&quot; he says. The defender also admitted he did a lot of thinking during the summer, pondering the departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez from Old Trafford. Wondering too in the aftermath of United&apos;s non-performance in the European Cup final, whether it had actually been a good season and asking himself what the club was doing signing Michael Owen. &quot;At first I thought it was a bad season, that was my first reaction,&quot; he said. &quot;But as time goes on and the days and the weeks pass, you judge it with a clearer head. We won three trophies and reached a second-successive Champions League final. But when you are travelling around in the summer you are never too far from a news stand and I would normally buy a sports magazine but this time I didn&apos;t. I was to-ing and fro-ing in my mind if I should have done this or that but it is time to put it to bed. It is over now, it&apos;s time to look forward to a new season.&quot; That though will be a season without Ronaldo and Tevez. &quot;I am a great badgerer of the coaching staff,&quot; Ferdinand said. &quot;I always want to know what&apos;s going on. Everyone was signing players and I was thinking to myself: &apos;Well, what are we doing?&apos; But, then again, if we have to go into a season with the same nucleus of players, I wouldn&apos;t have been bothered. What reassures me is that there is so much more to come from our younger players \u2013 the Machedas, the Welbecks, the Evanses. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t be bitter towards Ronnie. If you think that a career lasts 10-12 years, he gave six of them to Manchester United. Half of his career to one club after coming from Portugal. You couldn&apos;t cast a shadow over his dream to play for Real Madrid. Playing for Manchester United is the holy grail for some people, and some people won&apos;t understand him but he is a great lad and will always have an affinity with the players here. In time people will see that.&quot; Tevez, of course, has moved across Manchester, one of the players on which Mark Hughes has lavished millions of the riches available thanks to the club&apos;s owners. The audacious attempt to lure the England captain John Terry from Chelsea, though, looks to have failed and Ferdinand believes players have to think hard about why they are switching clubs. &quot;JT is his own man, he will make his own decisions, everyone makes their own decisions in life. If I were leaving Manchester United, I wouldn&apos;t go to a team I felt wasn&apos;t capable of winning trophies or finishing in the top three. Whether that is Manchester City I don&apos;t know. The more I think about it, abroad is the only place I can see myself going. I wouldn&apos;t want to be playing against Manchester United every week. I would rather go away. But sitting here I can&apos;t see myself leaving.&quot; It was in the far east in 2002 that Ferdinand first showed himself to be a defender touched by greatness and, had England done things differently, they would have capitalised on Owen&apos;s goal in the quarter-final with Brazil and maybe won the World Cup. Seven years later, Ferdinand and Owen are together again. &quot;Initially I was surprised when he signed. But I was thinking like a fan. If you look at his stats, he has played a lot more games than I thought but after seeing him close up I am very confident we have signed the right type of player. You can understand why the manager has put faith in him. He needs the ball delivered into dangerous areas and other people \u2013 the forwards and midfielders \u2013 are going to have to take responsibility for that because goals have gone out of our team and they need to be made up. One thing I&apos;m sure of is that Ronaldo&apos;s going will bring the best out in our players. We know he scored a lot of goals in the last two seasons for us, especially against the lower teams in the league. He&apos;d get a couple of goals a game against them on a regular basis. But we&apos;ve got players who we know are capable of doing that and now, whoever&apos;s on the pitch, I&apos;m sure they can go out there, do that job and fill the gap.&quot; Nobody in Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s squad would feel that as keenly as Wayne Rooney. When he arrived from Everton five summers ago and announced himself with a hat-trick against Fenerbahce on his debut for Manchester United, there seemed no doubt he would be Old Trafford&apos;s most glittering star, a mantle that, in the end, fell to Ronaldo. By no means has Rooney failed or underachieved at United, but centre stage is now his. &quot;He is such a team player and gives himself so completely to the team that he loses the selfishness other forwards have,&quot; Ferdinand said. &quot;I think Wayne&apos;s an instinctive player and you need them. If you have 11 robots on the pitch, then you are not going to be a successful or entertaining team. Free-flowing is the way United have always played.&quot; Ferguson has remarked that with Ronaldo and Tevez gone much will depend on Manchester United&apos;s defence, which, led by Ferdinand and with Edwin van der Sar, Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic, is probably the most formidable rearguard in the world. This time last season, it was a defence that Jonny Evans, the fiercely talented Belfast boy wondered if he could break into. Roy Keane and Sunderland were offering him guaranteed first-team football but Ferdinand gave him the same advice as he would Terry. In the world of the Premier League, where everyone is a millionaire, medals are the only currency that matters. &quot;I spoke to him in pre-season last year in South Africa. He asked me about it. He was at a stage where he wanted to play every week. He had that the season before on loan at Sunderland and he didn&apos;t want to come back and play reserve-team football again. &quot;But it&apos;s the same argument for any young player. Do you want to go and play for a team in mid-table or do you want to be in a squad where you&apos;re going to get chances to play in a title-winning team or European Cup-winning team? When you look at it like that, it&apos;s a bit of a no-brainer.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-07-24T22:00:02Z", "title": "Rio Ferdinand on why he has no fears for the new season despite the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo | Tim Rich", "sentences": ["There was a stag do in Tel Aviv, in which \u2013 for a dare apparently \u2013 he was photographed in the kind of stretched T-shirt and skimpy shorts that would not have looked out of place alongside Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s Bruno."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/24/rio-ferdinand-interview-manchester-united"}, {"tags": ["US foreign policy", "Syria", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US politics", "George Mitchell"], "article": "The White House will step up efforts to revive the near-moribund Middle East peace process this week, with senior Obama administration officials deployed to seek progress between Israel, Syria and the Palestinians. George Mitchell, the president&apos;s special envoy, flew to Tel Aviv today after &quot;candid and positive&quot; talks in Damascus with President Bashar al-Assad, who is being wooed by Obama after being shunned by the Bush administration. Mitchell went straight into a meeting with Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister. The US envoy said restarting talks between Israel and Syria was a &quot;near-term goal&quot; for Washington. &quot;I told President Assad that President Obama is determined to facilitate a truly comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace,&quot; he told reporters. Indirect negotiations between Syria and Israel, mediated by Turkey and centred on the occupied Golan Heights, were suspended during Israel&apos;s offensive against the Gaza Strip in December. Turkey said earlier this month it was ready to resume mediation efforts. But there has been no public sign from Syria that Assad has agreed to influence Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls Gaza, and the bitter opponent of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. Hamas, listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and Britain, is based in Damascus. The US is sending an ambassador back to Syria after withdrawing the previous incumbent in 2005 in protest at the Beirut assassination of Rafiq al-Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, which was widely blamed on Damascus, despite repeated denials. Syria&apos;s foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, said in London on Friday that Damascus - Tehran&apos;s only Arab ally - could help find a way out of the impasse over Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions, complicated by domestic turmoil since last month&apos;s disputed presidential elections. Underlining intensifying US diplomacy in the region, the defence secretary, Robert Gates, is also due in Israel tomorrow for talks with Barak and Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, on missile defence, Iran and bilateral security issues. General Jim Jones, Obama&apos;s national security adviser, and Dennis Ross, a senior Middle East and Iran expert, are also due to in Israel. The flurry of high-level activity follows Obama&apos;s long-heralded speech to the Arab and Muslim worlds in Cairo in June, when the president made clear his strategic commitment to working to achieve Middle East peace. These latest moves are intended to achieve concrete results. Mitchell and Barak have been trying to agree a delicate compromise on freezing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank - a hot potato in Israeli domestic politics but vital if Arab countries are to take any steps, at the urging of the US, to &quot;normalise&quot; relations with Israel. Netanyahu has pledged not to build new outposts or expropriate territory in the West Bank. But he insists construction must continue to accommodate &quot;natural&quot; Jewish population growth. The precise definition of a moratorium has yet to be agreed, though Israeli officials speak of exempting 2,500 housing units that are still being built. Palestinians and Arabs say a total freeze is the minimum required and accuse Netanyahu of bad faith. Mitchell is also due to see Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, at his Ramallah headquarters. In London, meanwhile, the all-party Commons foreign affairs committee urged the British government to talk to moderates within Hamas. Russia is the only member of the Quartet of Middle East peace brokers - which also comprises the US, UN and EU - which talks to Hamas. &quot;We conclude that there continue to be few signs that the current policy of non-engagement is achieving the Quartet&apos;s stated objectives,&quot; the committee said. &quot;The credible peace process for which the Quartet hopes, as part of its strategy for undercutting Hamas, is likely to be difficult to achieve without greater co-operation from Hamas itself.&quot; Israel remains implacably opposed to any dealings with Hamas, but pressure has been growing elsewhere for change. In March, Britain changed tack by announcing that it would end its boycott of the political wing of Lebanon&apos;s Iranian-backed Hezbollah - which is represented in the Lebanese parliament - but it remains opposed to talking to the Palestinian group.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-26T16:14:20Z", "title": "Barack Obama administration steps up diplomatic push to revive Middle East peace process", "sentences": ["George Mitchell, the president&apos;s special envoy, flew to Tel Aviv today after &quot;candid and positive&quot; talks in Damascus with President Bashar al-Assad, who is being wooed by Obama after being shunned by the Bush administration."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/26/george-michell-syria-israel-peace"}, {"tags": ["Obama administration", "US foreign policy", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "US news", "World news", "US politics", "George Mitchell"], "article": "Barack Obama has dispatched a clutch of senior American officials to Jerusalem to press his demand for an end to Jewish settlement construction and move along a diplomatic process aimed at imposing a blueprint for peace if negotiations fail.  Obama&apos;s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, is reportedly discussing a deal with the Israeli leadership that would allow the completion of several thousand homes for Jewish settlers already under construction but impose a total halt to building once they are complete. Such an agreement would amount to a concession by Obama, who laid down an immediate and complete freeze on construction as a marker of a more interventionist policy at a testy meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in Washington in May.  But American sources close to the negotiations say that getting Netanyahu to agree that no new construction can begin is an important step toward forcing a new diplomatic process that is no longer hostage to Israeli intransigence.  The diplomatic moves came as the Israeli military announced that the number of Jewish settlers on the West Bank has risen above 300,000 for the first time with about 200,000 more in East Jerusalem. About 2.5 million Palestinians live in the same territory. The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, is also in Israel as part of the drive to secure a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement.  The aim is to win a regional consensus on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme but also reassure the Israelis that Washington has not gone soft on the issue in an effort to dampen Israeli threats of military action. Gates said he did not believe that Barack Obama&apos;s timetable would &quot;increase the risks to anybody&quot; \u2014 a reference to Israeli concerns that its nuclear monopoly may soon be challenged by the Islamic republic. Israel has hinted at a pre-emptive attack on Iran should it deem diplomacy to be at a dead end. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s office said today that he reaffirmed to Gates &quot;the need to use all means to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear military capability&quot;. While the Obama administration continues to say that negotiation is the way forward, Gates today said that the promise of talks with Iran &quot;is not an open-ended offer&quot;.  Two other US officials are also visiting Jerusalem as part of the diplomatic push - Obama&apos;s national security adviser, James Jones, who in an Israeli diplomatic memo was reported to have told European officials that the administration will take a hard line with the Israelis, and Dennis Ross, Bill Clinton&apos;s special envoy to the peace process who was brought back to focus on Iran. The immediate effort is around a settlement freeze.  Tel Aviv newspapers report that Israeli officials say that talks are moving toward a deal in which the Americans will permit the completion of 700 buildings with nearly 2,500 new homes in them that are already well under construction, mostly in two settlements close to the green line which are likely to fall inside the Jewish state&apos;s border under a final agreement.  But as part of the agreement, the US intends to rigorously monitor the building work to ensure that the Israelis do not push it beyond the agreed limits. The Americans are acutely aware that in the past Israel has agreed to contain settlement expansion and then promptly broken its word. This time the US is insisting on detailed plans of what would amount to a final bout of construction before a total halt to building comes in to force.  Mitchell is also pressuring Arab countries for gestures in response to an Israeli settlement freeze such as trade delegations or overflight rights.  Mitchell said at a press conference that the disagreement over settlement construction is a &quot;discussion among friends&quot; but it is also a test of Obama&apos;s authority.  One former official who monitors the negotiations closely said that the US is prepared to give ground because it sees a settlement freeze as an important step toward reviving Israeli-Palestinian talks.  There is no great expectation in Washington that talks will go anywhere but that they should have been tried and failed once again will help smooth the diplomatic path for the administration&apos;s plan to force its own proposals on to the table later this year which could force Israel to make significant territorial concessions.  The Palestinians have been insistent that there can be no talks without a settlement freeze.  That still leaves the question of Jerusalem as a major obstacle.  Netanyahu very forthrightly spurned US demands to block a new settlement project in the occupied east of the city where an American millionaire plans to bulldoze an old hotel and build Jewish-only housing.  The prime minister said that Israel will not be dictated to on where its citizens can live in what it says is its eternal and indivisible capital. Netanyahu later said that all of Jerusalem will remain under Israeli jurisdiction even after a peace settlement.  Some American officials think Netanyahu may be overplaying his hand because if he puts himself in a position where he is unable to give ground on Jerusalem, that will require others to lay down Israel&apos;s final borders.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T16:32:12Z", "title": "Obama administration officials in Israel to demand end to settlement building", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv newspapers report that Israeli officials say that talks are moving toward a deal in which the Americans will permit the completion of 700 buildings with nearly 2,500 new homes in them that are already well under construction, mostly in two settlements close to the green line which are likely to fall inside the Jewish state&apos;s border under a final agreement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/27/obama-administration-israel-settlement"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Obama administration", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "US foreign policy", "US politics"], "article": "Israeli settler groups have set up 11 new outposts in the occupied West Bank, in a direct rebuttal of mounting US calls to freeze settlement activity. Young Jewish groups are reported to have set up the structures \u2013 mostly tents and huts on hilltops \u2013 in the West Bank over Monday night, in a move timed as a precursor to the meeting between the US special envoy, George Mitchell, and Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu today. On Monday, hundreds of settlers set up an outpost near the Palestinian village of Tulkarem, reportedly without intervention from the Israeli army. Settler groups said they were mimicking the fabled activities of 1946, when the area was ruled by British mandate and 11 Jewish outposts were defiantly erected in the Negev desert during one night. The mostly young Israelis are associated with settler organisations such as Youth for Israel, a militant group set up in response to Israel&apos;s evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip in 2005. According to the Jerusalem Post, settlers were canvassing support and distributing flyers over the weekend at existing settlements in the West Bank \u2013 which, like the outposts, are illegal under international law. One flyer read: &quot;The nations of the world do not want us here and we are responding by strengthening the connection to the land and by establishing new communities.&quot; Haaretz newspaper reported that 40 teenage girls spent three days in an established West Bank outpost in &quot;spiritual preparation&quot; for the &quot;relentless battle on the right to settle the Land of Israel&quot;.

It was at that point that Meir Amit, chief of the Israeli secret service Mossad, who has died aged 88, flew back from Washington with vital news for the Israeli prime minister, Levi Eshkol. Thanks to Amit&apos;s powers of persuasion, the US had agreed to sanction an Israeli pre-emptive strike. The result was the six-day war, one of the most astonishing military victories in history. The Mossad chief would later deny that he had provoked an attack or used deception to coax Jordan into the conflict to acquire the West Bank for Israel. He modernised Israel&apos;s intelligence services, championed her information revolution and became a respected strategic analyst. Born Meir Slutzky in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, at 15 he joined the Labour movement&apos;s Haganah underground militia (his mother, Haya, was a party activist) to defend Jewish communities in clashes with Arab neighbours. He lived on a kibbutz for 13 years, though for decades his principal base was the family home in Tel Aviv. In 1948, with Israeli independence, he led units of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) against Iraqi and Syrian invading forces. Once his cigarette case deflected a bullet, saving him from serious injury. A natural leader and respected tactician, Amit became commander of the Golani Brigade and in 1951 became head of operations of the IDF. In 1954 he took a British officer&apos;s training course. As aide-de-camp to chief of staff Moshe Dayan, he was associated with several allegedly overzealous cross-border &quot;reprisals&quot;, and together they planned Israel&apos;s successful 1956 Sinai campaign. He then studied economics and business at Columbia University, New York, before joining Aman, Israel&apos;s military intelligence agency, becoming its head in 1962. But there were troubles in the hidden world of espionage. Despite masterminding the kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann in Argentina in 1960, Isser Harel, boss of Mossad, was losing his touch. Amit criticised him for obsessively tracking down Nazi scientists supposedly working for Cairo. When Egypt publicly test-fired ballistic missiles in July 1962, Amit fumed: &quot;What are we spending our intelligence budget on? All we need is a portable radio!&quot; In 1963, Amit replaced Harel as head of Mossad, and for nine months, uniquely in Israeli history, he overlapped the position with directorship of Aman. Many pro-Harel agents, such as future prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, left Mossad in disgust. Nonetheless, Amit introduced US-style management techniques, installed computers, pioneered links with foreign agencies, and shrewdly incorporated elite undercover agents from Aman into Mossad. One Amir-run Mossad spy, Eli Cohen, sent Jerusalem detailed dossiers on Arab strengths and weaknesses from Damascus. Cohen inveigled himself into Syria&apos;s military establishment and was even tipped to become a deputy defence minister before he was unmasked in 1965 and executed. But the intelligence provided by Cohen, and Wolfgang Lotz in Cairo, proved invaluable in the 1967 war. Amit desperately wanted Israel to escape the straitjacket of regional isolation. To this end he forged ties with potential allies in Africa and Asia such as Kenya, Uganda, Singapore, Iran, India, Turkey and Indonesia. Amit warned Jordan&apos;s King Hussein of a possible coup, claimed to see the Shah each month, visited the CIA director Richard Helms at his home, and channelled arms to Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq, whose leader Mullah Mustafa Barzani he befriended. &quot;Personal contacts can solve most problems,&quot; he later told a television reporter. He also helped Morocco&apos;s security services, although the Arab kingdom was officially at war with Israel. In October 1965, Mossad was embroiled in the gunning down in Paris of a Moroccan dissident, Mehdi Ben-Barka, leading a furious De Gaulle to close the agency&apos;s European headquarters. Even the former Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion called it &quot;contemptible&quot;. Amit redeemed himself in 1966 by organising the defection to Israel of an Iraqi Christian pilot, Captain Munir Redfa. Israel invited CIA experts to pore over Redfa&apos;s captured MiG-21 fighter jet, a mainstay of the Soviet Air Force. This act cemented Israeli-US relations just as regional tensions were mounting. Even so, Amit detected hints of an Egyptian thaw. In 1966 he was about to negotiate directly in Cairo with President Nasser&apos;s deputy, Field Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer, when Eshkol&apos;s office vetoed the scheme. Had this meeting taken place, Amit claimed, conflict could have been averted. As it was, in 1967 Amit told US leaders during his visit to Washington that war was inevitable, would last a week and exact fewer casualties than in 1948 \u2013 predictions which proved uncannily accurate. On 3 June he assured Eshkol: &quot;They won&apos;t sit in mourning if Israel fires the first shot.&quot; Two days later, Israel destroyed Egypt&apos;s air force on the ground, and quadrupled its land area. Wary of Amit&apos;s growing autonomy, Eshkol sacked him in 1968 and the spy-master spent the next nine years as managing director of Koor Industries, the largest conglomerate in Israel. In 1976 Amit left the Labour party to co-found the Democratic Movement for Change. He infuriated Labour friends by joining Israel&apos;s first Likud-led cabinet as minister for transport in 1977. But Amit soon deserted the government for the liberal opposition Shinui (Change) party, eventually rejoining Labour in 1980. With his political capital spent, he devoted his remaining years to developing communication satellites, such as Amos, from which the New York Times is printed. Amit also became Israel&apos;s most devoted private collector of dolls, a hobby he began after receiving a gift from an Arab country. He built a collection of 1,500 toys gleaned from every nation he visited. Invariably discreet about past actions, in his 1999 memoirs, Rosh Be-Rosh (Head to Head), Amit likened information given away to &quot;Samson&apos;s hair before it is cut&quot;. Until Israel achieved real peace, he believed, there was no substitute for vigilance, and intelligence that compensated for Israel&apos;s lack of strategic and geographical depth. Yet his fears grew with time. In 2006 he said that apparently co-ordinated terror attacks denoted a world &quot;on the eve of world war three&quot;; he warned of the global imposition of &quot;the Islamic idea&quot;. And in 2007 he advocated that the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should &quot;be made to disappear&quot;, adding that if he wanted &quot;to die a martyr, he should be sent to heaven&quot;. Mostly, though, Amit preferred diplomatic pressure, secret or overt, to assassination. &quot;In intelligence, people are more important than rifles,&quot; said Amit, who is survived by his wife Yona, their three daughters and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Meir Amit (Meir Slutzky), soldier and intelligence chief, born 17 March 1921; died 17 July 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-07-28T18:46:12Z", "title": "Obituary: Major General Meir Amit", "sentences": ["He lived on a kibbutz for 13 years, though for decades his principal base was the family home in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/jul/28/obituary-major-general-meir-amit"}, {"tags": ["Madonna", "Judaism", "Religion", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Israel&apos;s biggest daily newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, and its affiliated website Ynet, has hosted a column by none other than Madonna. The singer has opted to share with her new Hebrew readership (and readers of Ynet&apos;s English version) her &quot;way to Kabbalah&quot;. Kabbalah, at least in its Madonnistic version, has little to do with Judaism as it is known to most Israelis, religious or secular, or to most Jews wherever they are. Madonna&apos;s account of her way to enlightenment leaves few cliches un-recycled, and contributes no new ones to humanity&apos;s body of knowledge. She has travelled the world many times, read the writings of many teachers, discovered that &quot;when the student is ready the teacher appears,&quot; and, following the appearance of one, Eitan, she has, oh bliss, &quot;found an answer&quot;. The Israelis who are most likely to get upset by Madonna&apos;s Kabbalistic rambling are ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are unlikely to be exposed to it, as they do not read secular newspapers. Kabbalah in its &quot;purest&quot; form \u2013 before it replaced pilates, macrobiotics, Scientology or Zen Buddhism as the latest celebrity trend \u2013 is a rather complicated and mystical body of writing in Judaism. Its sensitive content makes it &quot;forbidden&quot; to young and excitable religious students, and only older ones, with their rabbi&apos;s permission, are allowed to delve into its enchanted world of spirits and legends. Learning too much Kabbalah is considered to be something that might &quot;do your head in&quot;, which is exactly why the ignorant are advised to stay clear of it. Many Jewish and Israeli writers were enticed to take a peek into the &quot;orchard&quot; as it is often referred to, of Kabbalah, among them are Author Laureate Haim Nahman Bialik, and the writer Asher Barash. All this, naturally, has little to do with Madonna&apos;s Kabbalah-lite, or maybe diet-Kabbalah, judging by her latest published images. Her exciting adventures in the spiritual orchard may actually find keen readers in Israel, which in recent years is being more and more infested by irrational mumbo-jumbo of all sorts, some of it affiliated loosely to Judaism, and some related to other sects, religions and beliefs. Many go to visit local &quot;saints&quot; who deliver &quot;holy waters&quot; and various ointments to cure everything from cancer to childlessness; numerologists and astrologists appear regularly on morning news shows as career advisers or wellbeing tutors. Hundreds of thousands of young Israelis visit India every year, and many of them return enlightened and &quot;connected to themselves&quot; after visiting various Ashrams, and enjoying a fair amount of recreational drugs. Others return home wearing black, after having met Hassidic missionaries, who hang around India and collect to the warm bosom of Orthodox Judaism lost sheep who got confused by a cocktail of strong weed and intense Buddhism. Young settlers on hilltops tend to grow their hair long, wear white knitted yarmulkes, and adopt Hassidic mysticisms which horrify their pioneering parents, whose style, if not their beliefs, tended to be more sober. The hippy aesthetics, in case anybody gets confused, ironically tend to signify the more violent among the hilltop settlers of the west bank. This prevailing escapism sits well with the policy and tendency most Israelis have adopted towards the political situation, and mainly towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is connected tightly to another common concept known as &quot;the bubble&quot; \u2013 which most frequently refers to the hedonistic lifestyle of people in Tel Aviv.

While everybody involved in gay events always anticipates violence in the religious and conservative Jerusalem \u2013 and particularly in the Jerusalem gay pride parade which has become a centre of controversy in recent years \u2013 the gay community sees Tel Aviv as its safe haven. No matter how segregated, old fashioned, grumpy and troubled the rest of Israel gets, Tel Aviv keeps shining as a liberated autonomous jewel, the iconic big city into which anybody can integrate, or at least be tolerated. Its proud gay community, which has turned Tel Aviv into a tourist attraction for many Europeans, is also part of what makes some Israelis hate the &quot;bubble&quot;, as the city is often referred to. Nobody knows yet the identity of the masked character, dressed in black, who ventured into the bubble and shot the young people at the gay youth club on Saturday night. But as one of the commentators on the subject noted, a hate crime is defined by its victims, not its perpetrators. This much was understood by everybody. Even the community&apos;s most bitter enemies, the orthodox Shas party, ultra-orthodox MK Yaakov Litzman of Yahadut Hatora (United Torah Judaism) party and others were quick to condemn the murder in no uncertain terms. &quot;The Tel Aviv branch of Shas is shocked and pained and it condemns the murderous crime against the gay community,&quot; said Shahar Bakshi, a spokesperson for Shas. Litzman said he strongly condemned the killing and that the murderer should be caught and prosecuted &quot;like any other murderer&quot;. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu; the president, Shimon Peres; the leader of the Labour party, Ehud Barak; and the leader of the opposition, Tzipi Livni, all voiced their condemnations and condolences, and spoke of the importance of equality, freedom and tolerance. Those prompt responses say a lot about the influence the gay community in Israel has gained in recent years. The arrival of the first openly gay MK, Nitzan Horovitz (Meretz), in parliament after the last general election; the gay parade in Tel Aviv, which attracts national and international attention; and the struggle to keep a gay parade in Jerusalem have added many friends, and many foes, to the activist movement. The fact that the daughter of the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, Dana, is openly gay, has drawn some further attention to the community. However, there are other reasons for the wall-to-wall condemnations. Many of the speakers would like some of their own past statements to be forgotten, and want to pre-empt accusations in case a member of their own community is implicated in the crime. Shas leader Eli Yishay carries quite an unimpressive can of worms with him in this respect. He has referred to gay people as &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;perverse&quot; and dubbed the Pride parade &quot;the filth parade&quot;. Other members of his party have repeated his words at every opportunity. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, a prominent and influential figure among religious settlers, has said &quot;there is no such thing as gay and religious. This is a crime which is punished by death according to the Torah.&quot; In Israeli political culture, and especially in the context of political violence, a &quot;condemnation&quot; is often a prelude for an attack on the victims, and on those in their community for &quot;making political capital&quot; out of the tragic event. Such voices are already heard in the discourse that followed the weekend&apos;s events. The news websites are, as ever, full of mixed comments that mark the extremes of the debate. Some commentators, while paying tribute to polite condemnations, accuse the gay community of being &quot;provocative&quot;, and bringing harm upon itself. Others point an accusatory finger at the orthodox religious community. Many mention that only a few days ago the Jewish people commemorated the fall of the second Temple (70 AD), which according to tradition was destroyed due to &quot;causeless hatred&quot;. Sadly, many interpret this as referring only to hatred &quot;among Jews&quot; and voice shock and surprise that a &quot;Jew would kill another Jew&quot;. Others mention the pink triangle that gay prisoners in Nazi concentration camps were forced to wear. Biblical and holocaustic allusions often mark efforts to construct a rite of passage into Israeli society. And in the middle of all this havoc, the youth of Bar-Noar club remember their dead friends and tend to the injured. Their grief makes it very understandable why this little basement flat meant so much to them. &quot;The stairs that lead to this basement are the longest ones in the world because they lead to the greatest possible mental change,&quot; said one of them. &quot;I hope young people won&apos;t be afraid to descend this staircase in the future.&quot; The place was a refuge to Israeli youngsters of many different backgrounds, secular and religious, rich and poor, and in recent years many of its visitors have been from the Russian immigrant community \u2013 many of them well aware that a secular society is not, in itself, a guarantee for tolerance. &quot;My parents only found out I was gay when they were called to come and see me in hospital,&quot; said one of the youths injured in the incident. &quot;I&apos;m not quite sure which bit startled them more.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-08-03T16:30:00Z", "title": "Gay shooting inflames debate in Israel | Daphna Baram", "sentences": ["The shooting at the gay youth club Bar-Noar in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the tragic death of 26-year-old Nir Katz and 16-year-old Liz Tarboushi, and the injury of 13 others, is sending political shockwaves across Israel.", "While everybody involved in gay events always anticipates violence in the religious and conservative Jerusalem \u2013 and particularly in the Jerusalem gay pride parade which has become a centre of controversy in recent years \u2013 the gay community sees Tel Aviv as its safe haven.", "No matter how segregated, old fashioned, grumpy and troubled the rest of Israel gets, Tel Aviv keeps shining as a liberated autonomous jewel, the iconic big city into which anybody can integrate, or at least be tolerated.", "Its proud gay community, which has turned Tel Aviv into a tourist attraction for many Europeans, is also part of what makes some Israelis hate the &quot;bubble&quot;, as the city is often referred to.", "&quot;The Tel Aviv branch of Shas is shocked and pained and it condemns the murderous crime against the gay community,&quot; said Shahar Bakshi, a spokesperson for Shas.", "The arrival of the first openly gay MK, Nitzan Horovitz (Meretz), in parliament after the last general election; the gay parade in Tel Aviv, which attracts national and international attention; and the struggle to keep a gay parade in Jerusalem have added many friends, and many foes, to the activist movement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/03/gay-shooting-tel-aviv"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Race issues", "The far right", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Avigdor Lieberman is no aberration in Israel&apos;s polity. His aggressive rightwing Zionist rhetoric, racist demonisation of Palestinians and Arab-Israelis, shameless political populism and the tide of corruption allegations now close to engulfing him are all depressingly and dangerously familiar features of a broken system. The immigrant from Moldova has brilliantly exploited and contributed to the fracturing of politics in the state \u2013 but anyone who thinks his removal from the governmental scene will signal some sea change is sadly mistaken. The trends Lieberman represents and epitomises are deeply ingrained. Netanyahu is midwife and child of them, too. There is speculation that were Lieberman to resign as foreign minister if indicted \u2013 as he has said he would \u2013 this would give the prime minister the opportunity of replacing the Yisrael Beiteinu party in the coalition with Tzipi Livni&apos;s Kadima. But it is not as if Israeli democracy will suddenly return to normal if Lieberman and his party are forced out of government. Nor will Netanyahu miraculously reveal himself as having wanted to accede to President Obama&apos;s demand that Israel halt all new construction of and in Jewish settlements all along. When Lieberman and his colleagues introduced a number of legislative proposals designed to test the loyalty of Israeli Arabs and restrict their freedom of speech, it was against a backdrop of a society increasingly receptive to the views that underlie such measures. Back in late 2007, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) reported that there had been a 26% rise in anti-Arab incidents (pdf) during the previous year. The number of Jews expressing feelings of hatred towards Arabs had doubled, ACRI said. According to the June 2007 Democracy Index of the Israel Democracy Institute, for example, only half the public believes that Jews and Arabs must have full equal rights. Among Jewish respondents, 55% supported the idea that the state should encourage Arab emigration from Israel and 78% opposed the inclusion of Arab political parties in the government. According to a Haifa University study, 74% of Jewish youths in Israel think that Arabs are &quot;unclean&quot;. Before the February general election, Yisrael Beiteinu came top in mock polls conducted in 10 high schools across the country. Also, in sample polls at universities, young people showed enthusiasm for Lieberman. At the College of Administration, Lieberman&apos;s was the third-largest party, with 24 seats. Even at Tel Aviv University, normally seen as inclined to the left, Yisrael Beiteinu doubled its strength in relation to the sample poll conducted there ahead of the previous election, receiving 12 seats. Miriam Darmoni-Sharvit, who was overseeing the implementation of the 1995 Kremnitzer Commission&apos;s recommendations concerning democracy education, said:  In Israel, teaching democracy is not a priority for anyone, and it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s a problem with teachers&apos; democratic values.  Professor Zeev Sternhell points out that &quot;Lieberman is not a unique phenomenon. About one-third of the members of the current Knesset show contempt for democracy&apos;s moral contents.&quot; The Shas, United Torah Judaism and National Union parties, and others, &quot;show contempt for human rights&quot; and display authoritarian tendencies. And it&apos;s not that Lieberman has come late to far-rightist populism. As a younger man, he was a member of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane&apos;s Kach party, which 18 years ago was disqualified from running in elections because of its racist platform. &quot;The differences between Kach and Yisrael Beiteinu are minuscule, not fundamental and certainly not a matter of morality,&quot; wrote Gideon Levy. He went on:  The differences are in tactical nuances: Lieberman calls for a fascist &apos;test of loyalty&apos; as a condition for granting citizenship to Israel&apos;s Arabs, while Kahane called for the unconditional annulment of their citizenship. One racist [Lieberman] calls for their transfer to the Palestinian state, the other [Kahane] called for their deportation.  The fact that what was, once at least, officially outlawed by the political system is now an acceptable part of public discourse shows just how widespread in Israel society is the responsibility for the legitimisation of what Lieberman represents. Is it really surprising that young people will see the appeal of Lieberman&apos;s &quot;no-nonsense&quot;, &quot;straight-talking&quot;, simplistic message when, shortly after being appointed vice-premier by the former prime minister Ehud Olmert, he called for Israel&apos;s Arab population to be expelled from the country and all Olmert could say in response was &quot;my opinion is not like his opinion&quot;. When short-term political advantage rules; doing deals with parties that abhor democratic values is the norm; personal financial gain seems all too often to take precedence over the national interest; and very senior figures openly challenge the norms and values that a liberal democracy requires to guide personal behaviour, the system is deeply vulnerable to the way Lieberman plays on the frustrations and fears of the people. There is, however, a danger in stressing that Lieberman is a product of the weaknesses in Israeli society and its political system. It may appear to diminish the responsibility of individuals and institutions for not only creating the conditions that allowed Lieberman to gain such political power but for talking about him in such a way as to make him seem kosher. Such voices imply the sentiment that &quot;he may be a racist, but he&apos;s our racist&quot;. After the February election, when Netanyahu and Livni were vying for power, Ha&apos;aretz wrote: &quot;[They] are competing with each other to legitimise Yisrael Beiteinu and its hate campaign.&quot; Once Lieberman was in place as foreign minister, President Shimon Peres took it upon himself to confer legitimacy on the far-right leader. Ron Prosor, Israel&apos;s ambassador to the UK, has also done his bit to sanitise Lieberman in the eyes of British politicians and Anglo-Jewish leaders. Not that prominent diaspora Jews have needed any prompting to relativise, defend and even echo Lieberman&apos;s views. The American pro-Israel liberal lobby J Street produced a video quoting some American Jewish leaders&apos; comments &quot;whitewashing&quot; the foreign minister&apos;s views. In the UK, Jewish leaders have been silent on the dangers he represents. Have we heard a peep out of Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks on the subject? And take a look at an exchange of views between Daily Mail columnist Melanie Phillips and American lawyer Alan Dershowitz to see how closely some of Phillips&apos;s views match those of Lieberman. For some, it seems, it&apos;s enough that he&apos;s a secularist, says he support a &quot;two-state solution&quot; and promotes unbridled capitalism. But for others, only the starkest and most sober warning is appropriate. The Israeli historian and journalist Tom Segev responded to Lieberman&apos;s political success with these words:  For years ... [w]e told ourselves proudly that we did not hate; it was the enemy that hated us. Now hate has become legitimate for us, too.  The legal system may now clip Lieberman&apos;s wings, but the forces that produced him, and which he so successfully harnessed, are in dire need of far more radical treatment.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-04T11:30:00Z", "title": "Legitimising Lieberman | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["Even at Tel Aviv University, normally seen as inclined to the left, Yisrael Beiteinu doubled its strength in relation to the sample poll conducted there ahead of the previous election, receiving 12 seats."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/04/lieberman-israel-far-right"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Refugees", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israel&apos;s approach to refugees is based first and foremost on political expediency; humanitarian concerns coming a distant second in the decision-making process. The authorities deal with the matter as though they were a state-sized version of my alma mater, granting unfettered entry to those deemed genetically pure, while turning away anyone with the wrong type of blood coursing through their veins. While Israel is a fully paid-up signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its track record on assisting non-Jewish asylum seekers leaves a lot to be desired. The recent cancellation of the notorious Gedera-Hadera law has been hailed by some as a sign that Israel&apos;s leaders&apos; attitude towards refugees is softening, although again it appears politics is the main driver behind the volte-face. The original statute, enacted in 2008, prevented African asylum seekers from settling in the centre of the country (anywhere south of Hadera and north of Gadera), where they were deemed to be taking jobs from indigenous Israelis and creating an unworkable burden on the local authorities. However, driving the refugees to the periphery of the country has created a backlash from the residents of those towns where the migrants ended up. Given that the inhabitants of such areas tend to vote for rightist parties such as Shas and Likud, the interior minister, Eli Yishai, realised that shunting the &quot;refugee problem&quot; on to the doorstep of his party&apos;s voter base was likely to backfire at the polling booth \u2013 hence his scrapping of the law last week. When it comes to Jewish refugees, the state bends over backwards to welcome those arriving on its shores, providing instant citizenship to the incoming masses, along with all the trappings afforded to legal residents. Millions of shekels are spent on absorbing and integrating new arrivals into the system, teaching them Hebrew, arming them with health and education benefits and generally living up to Israel&apos;s founding fathers&apos; promise to provide sanctuary to every Jew on earth. A few years ago, some of that same benevolence seeped into the state&apos;s treatment of the influx of refugees from war-torn African countries. The mass arrival of African refugees began less than five years ago, and dates back to the killing in Egypt of dozens of asylum seekers by Cairo police during a protest outside the UNHCR headquarters in 2005. The slaying was a wake-up call to those fleeing genocide in Darfur, Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, who realised that they would need to look further afield for true shelter and respite, hence their taking the decision to cross from Egypt to Israel. Israel has dealt with the refugees in a somewhat uncertain fashion ever since: the authorities have granted asylum to a few hundred of the earlier wave of refugees and provided school places for those under 18 and temporary work visas to the adults from the burgeoning community. But politicians have been loth to present Israel as a &quot;soft touch&quot; and have sporadically cracked down on those seeking asylum in the country: rounding up those without papers, banning immigrants from certain cities in the centre of the country and imprisoning thousands for up to two years \u2013 culminating in the &quot;fascist&quot; bill currently making its way through the Israeli political system. The proposed &quot;infiltrator law&quot;, which sailed resoundingly through its first vote in the Knesset, has ratcheted up the tension between the authorities and the tens of thousands of African refugees to an unprecedented level. In effect, not only do those crossing illegally into Israel face up to 20 years in jail for their actions, but anyone deemed to be assisting the refugees \u2013 from doctors, to NGO workers, to casual volunteers \u2013 can be imprisoned as well for the &quot;crime&quot; of abetting the immigrants. By virtue of 17,000 African refugees having voted with their feet and arrived in Israel, it is clear that Israel is by no means the worst offender on the world stage when it comes to its attitude to asylum seekers. The harrowing tale of the Eritreans stuck in Calais who would rather risk life and limb trying to get into the UK than return to Italy or stay in France signifies how desperate conditions are in apparently enlightened countries in Europe. Likewise, the mistreatment of non-native migrants across the Arab world is scandalous, whether in the sweatshop shanty towns in Dubai or Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria. But for supporters of Israel to fall back on a defence that the Jewish state is the best of a bad bunch is hardly the most resounding endorsement of human rights and basic decency. Israel&apos;s previous record when it comes to creating a refugee problem and discriminating against those not of Jewish extraction is a major stain on the state \u2013 and the ongoing apathy-cum-antagonism towards the African asylum seekers only adds fuel to the fire. Whilst the spurious claims made in The Voice comparing Israeli jails to concentration camps are both absurd and offensive, a brief tour of Tel Aviv&apos;s refugee community shows how much work needs to be done if Israel is to honour its duty to all those seeking shelter on its soil. The squalor of refugee shelters, the malnutrition suffered by adults and children alike and the hostility of the authorities to the asylum seekers is an unpalatable way to act towards people in the same boat as the Jewish people have been throughout our history. Thinly disguised political horse-trading is no substitute for a fair and proper solution to the plight of the refugees; Israel has a responsibility to play fair with refugees from any background, regardless of creed or colour.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-05T08:00:01Z", "title": "Israel must play fair with refugees | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Whilst the spurious claims made in The Voice comparing Israeli jails to concentration camps are both absurd and offensive, a brief tour of Tel Aviv&apos;s refugee community shows how much work needs to be done if Israel is to honour its duty to all those seeking shelter on its soil."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/05/refugees-israel"}, {"tags": ["Europa League", "Everton", "Aston Villa", "Fulham", "Hearts", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Uefa", "Europa League 2009-10"], "article": "Everton have been drawn to face Sigma Olomouc in the Europa League play-offs.

I would guess that most Palestinians faced with this question would regard it as ridiculous. Notwithstanding the president&apos;s Cairo speech and his insistence on a total freeze on the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they would be deeply sceptical about the US president&apos;s ability to make any fundamental changes in US Middle East policy. Even were he to make such an adjustment, they would have grave doubts about whether it would seriously take on board Palestinian concerns. And they would be incredulous that anyone could argue that he is doing anything that could be interpreted as against Israel&apos;s interests. Once again, they would say, the Palestinians are being written out of the script. But to many American Jews, as well as to many Israeli Jews and to some Jews in the UK, the question would seem to reflect a very real and stark choice. While some who are taking sides on the issue are presenting their arguments in a reasonable manner, for others the issue is positively Manichean in its consequences, giving licence to quite staggering levels of rhetorical bitterness, vilification and hyperbole in an area where debate is already dangerously polarised. The reasons given for seeing Obama&apos;s presidency as an unprecedented opportunity seem plausible. London-based Middle East analyst Tony Klug recently argued that despite &quot;reason enough for deep despondency&quot;, &quot;for one reason alone, there is a perceptible if cautious optimism in the air: the election of an inspirational United States president, Barack Obama, who (amid many other policy challenges) is committed to making a serious effort to resolve the conflict.&quot; Daniel Levy, director of the Middle East task force at the New America Foundation in Washington, wrote in an online Economist debate: &quot;It would be curmudgeonly not to acknowledge the important points of departure in Mr Obama&apos;s approach and the promise his presidency holds out for a Middle East policy sufficiently evenhanded to deliver real breakthroughs.&quot; But David Frum, President George Bush&apos;s former speech writer, responded to Daniel Levy with an argument aimed at seeking out the jugular: &quot;I can remember not so long ago when even-handedness was diplomatic code for anti-Israel animus. Those now look like the good old days. The Obama administration has tilted so far against Israel that even-handedness looks like up from down here.&quot; No matter that Levy was an adviser to former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and lead Israeli drafter of the 2003 Geneva Initiative, Frum makes Levy&apos;s praise of Obama&apos;s &quot;evenhandedness&quot; look like a form of conniving in the destruction of Israel. All this is relatively sedate, as you might expect in an Economist-moderated debate. In the world of major American Jewish organisations and pro-Israel lobby groups, according to Ha&apos;aretz, &quot;feuding \u2026 is taking place behind closed doors and could be reaching its worst point in recent memory.&quot; This surfaced a few days ago when the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) placed a full-page ad in the New York Times which said: &quot;The problem isn&apos;t settlements, it&apos;s Arab rejection.&quot; The head of ADL, Abe Foxman, told Ha&apos;aretz: &quot;first of all [the Obama administration has] to stop the overkill. Every opportunity that they have to bash Israel they do.&quot; But Jeremy Ben-Ami, executive director of the liberal, &quot;pro-peace, pro-Israel&quot; advocacy group J Street, issued an open letter to Foxman accusing him of &quot;pointing fingers&quot; and arguing that &quot;the best route forward is not for each side to call on the other to move first, but to get all sides to the table with strong Jewish leadership to figure out how we move together&quot;. These differences ride on a sub-stratum of persistent, yet completely unfounded, &quot;accusations&quot; that Barack Obama is antisemitic, a terrorist and a Muslim (a &quot;crime&quot;, it would seem, in some people&apos;s eyes). Websites and blogs like this one continue to spread these lies. They link to articles damning Obama by &quot;respectable&quot; columnists like Charles Krauthammer and Caroline Glick and self-styled academics like Bat Yeor, thereby seeking to confer legitimacy on the wildest anti-Obama conspiracy theories. And in a bizarre exchange between Daily Mail columnist Melanie Phillips and the prolific Israel-defender and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz on FrontPage Magazine, Phillips emerges as a principal cheerleader for those who see Obama as the devil incarnate as far as Israel and &quot;truth&quot; are concerned. These two very high-profile, arch-propagandists for Israel virtually tear the skin from each other&apos;s bones over Obama. While Dershowitz does not object to the pressure the president is putting on Israel, and he and Phillips agree that the main barrier to peace is the Palestinians&apos; refusal to recognise Israel as a Jewish state, Phillips believes Dershowitz spectacularly fails &quot;to acknowledge the evidence of the hostility Obama is displaying towards Israel&quot;. Phillips says that in his Cairo speech Obama effectively denied &quot;that the Jewish people are in Israel as of right&quot; and makes the scurrilous claim that he &quot;subtly suggested an equivalence between the Nazi extermination camps and the Palestinian &apos;refugee&apos; camps&quot;. Phillips tells Dershowitz that she is &quot;upholding truth against lies, freedom against tyranny and justice against the moral inversion which regards third-world aggressors as victims and their victims as aggressors \u2013 precisely the thinking demonstrated by Obama&quot;, someone &quot;who would turn Israelis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem into sitting ducks for Palestinian rockets and bombs sited just down the road.&quot; To make this possible, &quot;Obama has skilfully constructed an administration composed of Israel-bashers, appeasement\u2013minded &apos;new realists&apos; and peace-process zealots \u2013 several of them Jews \u2013 all converging on precisely the same agenda to destroy Israel&apos;s security.&quot; It&apos;s but a short step from this to accusations that Obama is antisemitic. There is, of course, no guarantee that Obama&apos;s Middle East policy will succeed where others have failed. And Palestinian scepticism is well-founded, as Daniel Levy concedes: &quot;Were Spock to land here and conduct an inventory of Mr Obama&apos;s first six months, the only logical Vulcan conclusion would be that the aggregate of policies weighs in Israel&apos;s favour.&quot; But the wilder shores of Jewish and Israeli criticism of Obama have nothing in common with these reasoned doubts. They speak of a continuing inability to seize the political moment \u2013 a moment, Klug convincingly argues, when many of the building blocks for a two-state resolution of the conflict are in place. A bunker-mentality seems to prevail across much of the Jewish world \u2013 ideal circumstances for demonising Obama.

This envisaged a reformist victory and a new Iranian government willing to stop short of turning Iran into the world&apos;s 10th nuclear weapons state. The scale of opposition protest suggests that change will come, but it may arrive later rather than sooner. In the meantime we are faced with an insecure conservative regime that hopes to shore up its fragile position by exaggerating the external threat and making national security the defining issue of domestic politics. This is not a promising basis for compromise. These risks are compounded by the apparent urgency of the situation. Although Iran&apos;s intentions and capabilities are hotly disputed and difficult to gauge, most analysts agree that it is close to achieving a nuclear &quot;breakout&quot; capability, whether it plans to build an actual weapon or not. That is why Obama has timetabled next month to take stock of the offer he made in March for a new relationship with Iran based on dialogue and &quot;mutual respect&quot;. The lack of any positive signal from Tehran in the next few weeks is likely to trigger an American move to tighten international sanctions in an effort to dissuade the Iranian leadership from going any further down the nuclear path. Waiting impatiently in the wings is a new, hardline Israeli government that regards a nuclear-armed Iran as the only outcome it is unwilling to tolerate. In his campaign statements, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, adopted an uncompromising stance: &quot;I promise that if I am elected, Iran will not acquire nuclear arms, and this implies everything necessary to carry this out.&quot; All options, including a unilateral military strike against Iran&apos;s nuclear installations, are therefore considered a price worth paying to avert what Netanyahu characterises as an &quot;existential threat&quot;. Israeli officials measure the limit of their patience in months rather than years. Netanyahu knows that Obama would not support an Israeli military operation, which is why he will not repeat the mistake of his predecessor by asking for permission. It took Bush eight years, but he finally got something right when he told Ehud Olmert to back off. What even he couldn&apos;t ignore is the serious instability and damage to western interests that a move of this kind would invite: a renewed upsurge of anti-American feeling across the Middle East sending moderate allies scuttling for cover; a further wave of terrorist violence and a new lease of life for al-Qaida; the targeting of allied forces in Afghanistan and Iraq; and perhaps weighing heaviest of all, the closure of the Strait of Hormuz and an oil price spike that would tip recession into depression There are, in any case, good reasons for believing that a military strike would fail to achieve its objective of stopping or even seriously delaying Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. Having learned from the destruction of Iraq&apos;s only nuclear reactor by Israel in 1981, Iran has concealed, dispersed and protected its nuclear assets in hardened bunkers. Even if Israeli jets could hit the right targets at the limit of their operational range, the damage could probably be repaired fairly quickly. Ayatollah Khamenei would use the crisis to snuff out all hope of political change and the result would be a nuclear-armed Iran, radicalised by war and subject to even fewer domestic and international constraints. It is time for western leaders to consider if such an outcome would really be preferable to the alternative of adjusting peacefully to the prospect of an Iranian bomb. Many argue that the risk of military action is worth it because Iran is fundamentally irrational and its possession of nuclear arms would represent an unbearable threat to world peace. In Netanyahu&apos;s words, the Islamic Republic is a &quot;messianic apocalyptic cult&quot; that &quot;glorifies blood and death, including its own self-immolation&quot;. The fanaticism of its leadership makes it undeterrable because, faced with the prospect of nuclear retaliation, it &quot;might put its zealotry above its self-interest&quot; and strike out regardless of the consequences. If Israel is the collective Jew in the Likud world view, then perhaps Iran is the collective suicide bomber; an entity that respects no moral or human limits in pursuit of its destructive vision. One important reason for dismissing this characterisation of Iran is that Israeli policymakers clearly don&apos;t buy it themselves. As Trita Parsi recounts in his book Treacherous Alliance, Israel has in the past been more than willing to overlook the Islamic Republic&apos;s anti-Israeli rhetoric and sponsorship of terrorism by courting it as a potential ally. The most obvious example was Israel&apos;s role in brokering the Iran-Contra deal, shipping weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Israel was willing to do this to cultivate better relations with the ayatollahs; it recognised that they could act rationally and self-interestedly when faced with the prospect of defeat in their war with Iraq. Netanyahu even tried to revive this link during his first stint as prime minister in the late 1990s. Israel switched tack not because of any change in Iranian behaviour, but because Iraq ceased to be a military power that Israel felt the need to balance with an alliance of the non-Arab periphery. Having replaced Iraq as the region&apos;s second strongest power, Iran has now become the logical focus of Israeli policy. This approach is essentially no different to the balance-of-power diplomacy Britain once practised in Europe, opposing whichever continental power happened to be strongest at any given moment. What is often portrayed on both sides as a struggle between good and evil is in reality a rather traditional competition for regional influence. Some point to President Ahmadinejad&apos;s statement that Israel should &quot;disappear from the page of time&quot; as a reason to view Iran differently. But no one seriously imagines that his finger would be on the nuclear button. Military command and control is the prerogative of the clerical elite, which more than anything is concerned with preserving its own power structure. Even anti-Zionist posturing is rationally grounded in Iran&apos;s desire to increase its regional clout despite the limitation of being a non-Arab state. Militancy on behalf of the Palestinians is often just another instrument of statecraft, and a particularly cynical one. It isn&apos;t going to be pushed to the point where the Islamic Republic&apos;s survival is in jeopardy. Dark fantasies about pre-emptive strikes on Tel Aviv or nuclear devices being handed to Hezbollah and Hamas have no basis in serious analysis. No one should want a nuclear-armed Iran and new sanctions should certainly be tried. But if we calculate correctly that the prospect of an Iranian bomb ultimately comes down to a question of Iranian willpower, then a mature debate needs to be had about how we manage that risk. Instead of threatening military action that will only increase Iran&apos;s desire for nuclear weapons while undermining opportunities for democratic change, western powers should focus on developing a robust deterrence framework that provides security guarantees to vulnerable countries and reminds Iran&apos;s leaders of what they stand to lose by abusing their nuclear potential. Proliferation is always a risk, but we can live with a nuclear Iran if we have to.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-13T22:00:01Z", "title": "Military action is dangerous fantasy.

As the country revels in a tourism boom and Beirut&apos;s beaches and restaurants brim with visitors, beneath the surface there is deep unease about the potential for violent upheaval. Arriving in Beirut, the country&apos;s politics \u2013 the prevalence of engaged discussion \u2013 slaps you in the face. Even while waiting in the departure lounge for my flight there, I caught several animated conversations \u2013 the names of leaders past and present floating through the air. The ongoing cabinet negotiations and uncertainty that followed the &quot;victory&quot; of the March 14 Alliance are front-page news that greets you on exiting Rafik Hariri international airport, built and named after the man whose unresolved death is a parable for the inherent weaknesses of the Lebanese pseudo-state. Travelling into town from the southern suburbs the horizon is packed with cranes that are finishing off the rebuilding from the 2006 Israeli bombardment. The drive through the city is a trip of political portraits and tribal flags. The astonishing volte face of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt away from what was simplistically characterised by many commentators as the anti-Syrian alliance is still rocking the boat of Lebanese attempts to form a cabinet. Initial promises by the March 14 group to form one within a week, and to have enough independence to stand apart from Hezbollah, have been shattered and some are questioning whether the young Hariri has enough of the political acumen that fuelled his father&apos;s success until his untimely demise. Meanwhile beneath the political bickering a greater challenge may lie on the horizon. There is talk of &quot;war shopping&quot;, of people storing up supplies in case growing Israeli rhetoric towards the country becomes a reality. Interestingly even Hariri stated recently that &quot;We are neither against Iran, nor against Syria; we are only against Israel because it is our enemy.&quot; This is despite the enduring legacy of the 2006 conflict, which is still very visible. Buildings are being rebuilt, Israeli aircraft regularly buzz the south and hundreds are maimed or killed each year by the millions of cluster munitions that were dropped during Israel&apos;s retreat. Similarly to the 2008 Gaza conflict, the 2006 war was a &quot;rocket war&quot; where initial attempts to rescue captured soldiers escalated to the almost impossible task of destroying Hezbollah&apos;s rocket arsenal. According to recent reports this arsenal, although pushed north of the border by the expanded presence of international peacekeepers (Unifil 2), is estimated to be 40,000 strong with rumours that some rockets could hit Tel Aviv or even Israel&apos;s undeclared nuclear weapon facilities in the south. This would give Hezbollah, an ally of Iran, the potential to extract an &quot;eye for an eye&quot; if any US/Israeli attack against Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities was to occur. This may be simple Hezbollah propaganda designed to ward off any attack, yet during the 2006 war the missile strike against the Israeli navy and the ground handling of anti-tank munitions speak of an adversary that should not be taken lightly. Perhaps this explains the increasing pressure from Israel. Last week the Israeli deputy foreign minister promised that if &quot;one hair&quot; on a representative of Israel or an Israeli tourist was hurt, there would be &quot;dire consequences&quot;. This may be an attempt to warn Hezbollah off seeking revenge for the car bomb assassination of Imad Mugniyeh in Damascus last year. Yet Hezbollah&apos;s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, admitted that he misjudged the Israeli response to the soldiers&apos; capture in 2006 and he would be well advised not to treat the Israeli threats as empty. There is of course a historical precedent: the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon was triggered by an assassination attempt on their ambassador to the UK by Abu Nidal. An Israeli administration frustrated by the American attempts to rein in its settlement programme could find welcome distraction in an attempt to succeed where Kadima failed. Whether there is a war or not, the very fact that such potential still exists, only three years after a previous conflict wiped out the lives of so many, is testimony to the dangers of conflicts that are not resolved but rather simply put on ice.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-15T14:00:00Z", "title": "War talk stalks Beirut | James Denselow", "sentences": ["According to recent reports this arsenal, although pushed north of the border by the expanded presence of international peacekeepers (Unifil 2), is estimated to be 40,000 strong with rumours that some rockets could hit Tel Aviv or even Israel&apos;s undeclared nuclear weapon facilities in the south."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/15/lebanon-hezbollah"}, {"tags": ["Newcastle United", "Reading", "Mike Ashley", "Championship", "Football", "Sport", "Championship 2009-10"], "article": "Appearances can be hugely deceptive. Superficially all certainly seemed well on Tyneside, with a healthy crowd cheering Newcastle United to the rafters as Shola Ameobi&apos;s hat-trick consigned Reading to a comprehensive 3-0 Championship defeat. Scrape a fraction beneath the surface, though, and you will find a club in such turmoil that local dramatists are pinching their increasingly far-fetched, ultra soapy, plotlines. Earlier this summer You Really Couldn&apos;t Make it Up \u2013 a play detailing Newcastle&apos;s recent travails \u2013 drew full houses at the city&apos;s Live Theatre. Since its run ended, the tragi-comic farce at St James&apos; Park has taken a few more bizarre twists, but, at long last, a denouement appears in sight. Unfortunately it could involve a return to &apos;square one&apos; and, alarmingly, Joe Kinnear might yet be part of it. After a close season spent forlornly endeavouring to offload Newcastle to assorted Omanis, Malaysians, Emiratis, Singaporeans and Americans, Mike Ashley, the club&apos;s ever-unpredictable, increasingly eccentric, ultra-contrary owner and multi-millionaire sports retail magnate, seems poised to perform one of his now trademark U-turns. Should Barry Moat, a local property developer and major corporate client at St James&apos;, fail to persuade Barclays Bank to lend him the money needed to meet Ashley&apos;s \u00a3100m asking price, the latter will duly haul down the &apos;for sale&apos; signs. Small wonder that the rousing applause in celebration of the late Sir Bobby Robson&apos;s life had barely faded away before press-box regulars started swivelling their necks to study the body language of the directors box&apos; occupants. Inside its cloistered confines, Moat sat sandwiched between Ashley and Derek Llambias, Newcastle&apos;s managing director, suggesting that the trio&apos;s lunch-table chat at a pre-match charity function had proved amicable. They were certainly all smiles and back-pats as Ameobi struck. A decision on any takeover is expected soon. If, and it seems a big if, Moat receives the green light, Alan Shearer will immediately be installed as manager. Despite winning just one of his eight games in charge at the end of last season while failing to prevent Newcastle&apos;s Premier League demise, the former England captain would be a hugely popular choice. Tellingly, chants of &quot;Shearer, Shearer&quot; regularly segued into &quot;Walking in a Robson Wonderland&quot; to provide last night&apos;s emotionally charged soundtrack. Perhaps surprisingly, the relatively tame chants of &quot;Stand up if you hate Ashley&apos; were merely sporadic. Even so, the owner&apos;s popularity might dip if, as anticipated, Moat&apos;s deal collapses and, hoping to secure a better price next year, Ashley \u2013 already actively seeking a new manager of his choice \u2013 announces he will stay on for another season. Although negotiations with David O&apos;Leary and his hardball-playing representative, the lawyer Michael Kennedy, broke down last week, O&apos;Leary knows the Newcastle job could prove his redemption story, offering him a last shot at rebuilding a once-glittering but now badly tarnished managerial career. It is still conceivable that the former Leeds United and Aston Villa manager might end a three-year exile from the game by compromising on personal terms and taking charge before the weekend. While O&apos;Leary would hardly be a populist appointment, he is generally regarded as infinitely preferable to Ashley&apos;s back-stop option, namely Kinnear. The former Wimbledon manager&apos;s stint in charge last season before an enforced departure for open heart surgery was undistinguished to say the least and both Shearer and Newcastle&apos;s players subsequently delighted in deconstructing his regime. Kinnear \u2013 who apparently believes he is on his way back to Tyneside \u2013 recently further blackened his reputation north of Scotch Corner by suggesting that Newcastle fans had a low tolerance threshold towards southerners and were overly fixated on those two sacred cows, Shearer and Kevin Keegan. While it would be an exaggeration to say he&apos;s about as popular in Geordieland as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tel Aviv, there remains a real possibility that the Toon Army would turn militant were Kinnear reinstated. Indeed, it might be best all around if the doctors who have already advised against his returning to work until December intervene. Whoever eventually takes charge \u2013 Alan Curbishley is an outsider \u2013 will inherit a much depleted squad. Eight players have left since May and Damien Duff appears Fulham bound. The departures of Michael Owen and Obafemi Martins were inevitable, but those of key defenders S\u00e9bastien Bassong and Habib Beye to Tottenham and Aston Villa threaten to derail a promotion challenge. Especially as Manchester United loanee Danny Simpson remains caretaker boss Chris Hughton&apos;s solitary summer signing. With the transfer window&apos;s closure looming, time is running out to recruit replacements. After Ameobi&apos;s exploits, Ashley might believe none is necessary. He might think Hughton is the managerial answer.

But Pollard&apos;s case soon crumbled. Most of the key allegations about things Kaminski had said and activities he had been involved in were shown to be true. Journalists have unearthed yet more evidence that, despite his denials, Kaminski did indeed give an interview to the rightwing journal Nasza Polska in 2001, in which he said that the president of Poland &quot;should withhold apologies&quot; for the massacre by Poles, with SS assistance, of hundreds of Jews in the village of Jedwabne in July 1941. Even more telling is the fact that, in March 2001, he was one of the founders of the Committee to Defend the Good Name of Jedwabne, a local group dedicated to minimising Polish participation in the massacre. Kaminski was quoted in Gazeta Wyborcza on 6 March 2001 as saying the organisation was set up to protest at the &quot;world campaign of slander against Jedwabne and against the whole of Poland&quot;. As for &quot;using false charges of antisemitism for political gain&quot;, given that the European Jewish Congress, Rabbi Barry Marcus (Orthodox rabbi of London&apos;s Central Synagogue) and Rabbi Michael Shudrich, the hugely respected chief rabbi of Poland \u2013 hardly a trio of leftists or acolytes of Edward McMillan-Scott, the Tory who stood against Kaminski in the election of the ECR leader \u2013 had already all condemned Tory support of Kaminski, this accusation seemed extraordinarily perverse. It&apos;s not difficult to explain why Pollard would get this so wrong, and I&apos;ll come to that in a minute. But what stood out most starkly in the article was the following: &quot;Far from being an antisemite, Mr Kaminski is about as pro-Israeli an MEP as exists.&quot; The idea that being &quot;pro-Israeli&quot; inoculates you against being an antisemite, or that it means that you are incapable of holding antisemitic views, is simply false \u2013 both as a theoretical proposition and as a statement of fact. But said by Pollard, at this point in time, such a statement comes as no surprise. Polish antisemitism is a complex phenomenon. The often repeated notion that &quot;Poles drink in antisemitism with their mothers&apos; milk&quot; is equally as false as the statement that &quot;the Polish nation protected its Jews from the Nazis&quot;. If, for example, your test of whether a Pole is antisemitic is hearing them say publicly &quot;I hate the Jews&quot;, you may think Polish society to be remarkably free from serious Jew-hatred. What counts is not necessarily the words used but the context in which they are said. It may be technically true that when Kaminski criticised President Aleksander Kwasniewski&apos;s apology for Jedwabne, he meant, Pollard says, that &quot;the massacre was not committed by &apos;the Poles&apos; against &apos;the Jews&apos;, but was a vile crime committed by specific individuals against their fellow nationals&quot;, but to use this to excuse Kaminsky shows extreme naivety (as Kaminsky&apos;s remarks of 6 March 2001 prove). It&apos;s a coded way of belittling what happened to the Jews, without denying it completely, and implying that the existence of antisemitism among Poles is exaggerated. If anyone needs excusing, it&apos;s Pollard. There&apos;s little to suggest that he is an expert on antisemitism, let alone on Polish antisemitism. His statement that &quot;as editor of the Jewish Chronicle, and [Labour MP] Mr MacShane&apos;s predecessor at the [European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism] EISCA, I am more alive than most to antisemitism&quot; highlights the nature of his problem, rather than the quality of his credentials. First, while the JC editor may be bombarded with stories about antisemitism, this confers on him no special expertise and could easily make him less, rather than more, alive to antisemitism. Second, Pollard was chairman of EISCA for less than a year, a body that is barely breathing, has no director and has produced nothing original since it was founded two years ago, except a contentious paper, using \u00a320,000 of government money, arguing for the banning of playing &quot;the Nazi card&quot; against Israel and Zionism. Not the best work experience to have on your CV if you are claiming the status of an expert on antisemitism. It may be true that Kaminski is trying to divest himself of his antisemitism, but the political party he now belongs to, Polish Law and Justice (PiS), is hardly a home for anti-racists. As the Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Racism and Antisemitism, based at Tel Aviv University, reports, it contains radical nationalists and former members of antisemitic organisations and maintains a strategic alliance with Radio Maryja, &quot;the mass-audience nationalist Catholic radio station and a key force on the far right&quot;, which gives airtime to antisemitic demagogues. But if we&apos;re in the mood to give Kaminski the benefit of the doubt as a reforming character, an email I received from Konstanty Gebert, former Solidarity activist, leading figure in Poland&apos;s post-Communist Jewish revival and Gazeta Wyborcza columnist, is worth noting: &quot;[Kaminski] has never taken anti-antisemitic positions that I know of. A possible analogy might be [former Italian neo-fascist leader] Gianfranco Fini \u2013 but he had made his change of heart quite explicit, and had to sweat before it was accepted. I see no reason why Kaminski should get softer treatment.&quot; This brings us back to Pollard&apos;s stark words I quoted earlier, because we can imagine him saying that one reason Kaminski should get &quot;softer treatment&quot; is that he is &quot;about as pro-Israeli an MEP as exists&quot;. This judgment \u2013 whereby you assess the salience of someone&apos;s antisemitism or their perspective on Jews, and whether they are a respectable political partner, on the basis of their views on Israel \u2013 is rarely formulated in the explicit terms employed by Pollard. And yet, it&apos;s a judgment that Jews are now constantly being challenged to make \u2013 by far-rightists and former neo-fascists seeking political respectability, who now support Israel and see Israel-supporting Jews as potential allies in their fight against the &quot;Muslim threat&quot;. Jewish communities are divided on how to respond, but some Jewish leaders and groups have been seduced and have acquiesced. And it&apos;s a challenge posed by the millions of Christian Zionists in America, who offer unconditional support to Israel, but who think Jews in Israel are doomed to hellfire. A number of American Jewish organisations have engaged with these pro-Israel evangelical groups to the consternation of many other leaders and groups in the American Jewish community. The engagement with Christian Zionists and the approval offered to &quot;reformed&quot; far-rightists like Kaminski, on the grounds of their &quot;pro-Israeli&quot; and/or anti-Muslim positions, is the worst kind of short-term political opportunism. It&apos;s a tragic error and deeply damaging for Jews and for Israel. But if people who are defined as &quot;anti-Israel&quot; are demonised as antisemitic, the implication of the Pollard judgment, that people who are &quot;pro-Israel&quot; cannot be antisemitic, flows logically from it. That self-styled &quot;experts&quot; on antisemitism have brought us to this Alice in Wonderland conclusion is quite simply deplorable.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-21T14:00:00Z", "title": "But is Kaminski good for the Jews? | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["As the Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Racism and Antisemitism, based at Tel Aviv University, reports, it contains radical nationalists and former members of antisemitic organisations and maintains a strategic alliance with Radio Maryja, &quot;the mass-audience nationalist Catholic radio station and a key force on the far right&quot;, which gives airtime to antisemitic demagogues."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/21/stephen-pollard-michal-kaminski-jews"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "On a ridge high above the West Bank town of Nablus, a cluster of red roofs and neat white concrete homes mark the Israeli settlement of Elon Moreh, its security patrols on alert for attackers like the lone Palestinian gunman who mowed down four residents during the second intifada. Elon Moreh was founded in 1979, but the name is mentioned in Genesis as the site of the Patriarch Abraham&apos;s first sojourn in the promised land. It is one of 133 &quot;official&quot; Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem that are the focus of intensifying US-led attempts to restart the moribund Middle East peace process. It has not taken Barack Obama long to discover that in the high-octane politics of the Arab-Israeli conflict, few issues are as explosive as this: Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, is arguing hard over the precise meaning of a settlement &quot;freeze&quot; or the &quot;natural growth&quot; of the existing population. And the president, who singled out settlements for stark criticism in his Cairo speech in June, is being painted as an enemy of Israel. For Palestinians, the settlements and the 500,000 Israelis who now live in them form an impassable political and physical obstacle to peace \u2013 a seemingly permanent feature of a biblical landscape that has been transformed in the 42 years since the 1967 war. Unless the settlements are removed, they insist, there cannot be a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank, already peppered with hundreds of army checkpoints and divided into disconnected enclaves crisscrossed by settler-only roads, closed military areas \u2013 and Israel&apos;s controversial separation barrier. Many believe it is already too late. Obama&apos;s grand hopes for a peace agreement based on two independent states living side by side could founder on the rock of settlement expansion. Even US-backed Arab states such as Saudi Arabia say they cannot, as Obama wants, &quot;normalise&quot; relations with the Jewish state unless settlement activity stops. Egypt and Jordan, which already have peace treaties with Israel, agree. Israelis themselves are divided. The settlement of Elon Moreh, explains ultra-Orthodox community activist Sarah Gelbard, &quot;is the holiest place on Earth, a place that Hashem [God] himself chose for his holiest people. It can&apos;t be tampered with, given away, torn apart or anything else.&quot; Some secular Israelis support settlement, but only for strategic reasons \u2013 in the Jordan valley or on the Golan Heights, captured from Syria. Only Israelis on the far left advocate full withdrawal to the 1967 borders. Most hope for a deal under which big &quot;urban&quot; settlements such as Ma&apos;aleh Adumim and Ariel, near or straddling the pre-war &quot;green line&quot; or inside the &quot;security wall&quot;, would be incorporated into Israel in exchange for land in the Negev: that was the plan at Camp David in 2000 before the second intifada erupted. According to one recent poll, 66% of Israeli Jews want to hold on to East Jerusalem. Unlike the West Bank it was annexed to Israel and is now home to 200,000 Jews in suburbs that encircle Arab areas. But under international law it too is considered occupied territory. Even Palestinians who still believe in a two-state solution see the Israeli settlements as the continuation of a century of colonisation, dispossession and disaster. The only certainty has been that whether their lands were purchased, conquered or expropriated, they have nearly always been lost for ever. Settlements have often been billed as &quot;an appropriate Zionist response&quot; to pressure for concessions. In the 1970s and 1980s the Gush Emunim (Bloc of the Faithful) movement proved adept at manipulating first Labour and later Likud governments which feared confronting the religious nationalists \u2013 who were seen as zealous new &quot;pioneers&quot;. That remained true after 1993, when Yasser Arafat signed the Oslo agreement with Yitzhak Rabin but without securing a settlement freeze. The number of settlements and settlers doubled in the decade that followed. In 1998 Ariel Sharon, then in charge of US-brokered talks with Arafat, urged settlers &quot;to move, run and grab as many hilltops as they can \u2026 because everything we take now will stay ours. Everything we don&apos;t grab will go to them.&quot; In 2004, as prime minister, he persuaded George Bush to endorse the same &quot;new realities on the ground&quot; that Obama is now challenging.

It is a glaring challenge to the Obama administration, which is trying to halt all Israeli settlement growth as a precursor to renewed peace talks. But recent history suggests it is the highly-motivated settlers like Matar, 43, a mother of six born in Belgium and now living in the settlement of Efrat, who may in the end triumph on this particular dusty patch of land. Tomorrow, the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu arrives in London for a series of key meetings, including four hours of discussions on Wednesday with the White House&apos;s special envoy, George Mitchell, and talks with Gordon Brown tomorrow. The continued colonisation of the West Bank, an extraordinarily successful project over the past 40 years, will dominate the agenda. Settlement on occupied land is regarded as illegal by the rest of the international community, but nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers live in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Shdema is even beyond Israel&apos;s West Bank barrier, which runs deep into Palestinian territory and which many believe will one day be the final border of Israel. Matar&apos;s goal is &quot;redemption of the land&quot;. In her view, the land on which the Palestinian homes sit belongs by Biblical and historical right to the Jewish people and is, for now, &quot;temporarily under Arab occupation&quot;. She is trying to build a &quot;Jewish Shdema&quot; and to prevent the land from remaining Palestinian. After the military evacuated the base there were plans, since shelved, to build a hospital for Palestinians. &quot;They want more pieces of land that belong to the Jews. They want to take it away from us,&quot; Matar said. &quot;The Land of Israel was given by God to the people of Israel,&quot; she said. &quot;Some will tell you God gave it to us, others will say Jewish history of 4,000 years is our historical right \u2026 You don&apos;t have to be a religious Englishman to see London belongs to the British.&quot; This is a rare insight into how outposts get built: with determined settlers and eventually complicit Israeli authorities. At first, after the army withdrew from the base three years ago, soldiers closed the area off and prevented all settlers from approaching. But the settlers sneaked in and kept coming. Eventually Matar, a leader of the group Women in Green, and her supporters convinced the military to allow them in just once a week, on a Friday. They cleaned the buildings up, painted over graffiti, tidied the rooms and held workshops and discussions. Sometimes they have stayed the night, sometimes they have been allowed to come twice a week and eventually, they believe, settlers will begin to live here. Similar struggles take place every week on other hilltops across the West Bank. All this is happening even though the Israeli government says in public it will allow no new settlements. &quot;At the beginning we fought against the army to come up here,&quot; said Matar. &quot;But when they saw we were adamant they let us come on a Friday \u2026 But it&apos;s not enough for us. We don&apos;t want to ask permission to be in our homeland.&quot; Now every time they come the army far from preventing them in fact provides them with security, deploying several soldiers and armoured vehicles but not interfering with their activities. In April the military also halted the construction of a Palestinian park, part funded by the US government, because it was at the foot of the hill claimed by the settlers at Shdema. Already the settlers have produced a glossy brochure with architectural plans of the Shdema they would like to see: it has grassy lawns, lines of trees, a cultural centre and a small but thriving Jewish community. On this day around 30 settlers of different ages gathered, among them several children, a rabbi and at least two women carrying discreetly holstered pistols. They sat in one room on plastic chairs as Tomer Karazi, 34, a rabbi with five children, discussed a Biblical text and the importance of building a new village in this Biblical land. Later Karazi said he and his wife Hannah were ready to move from their home in the settlement of Nokdim to Shdema as soon as possible. &quot;It&apos;s our duty not to escort the process of redemption from the outside but to be involved and active from the inside,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t need to wait for things like water and electricity. And we really love the place. It&apos;s beautiful.&quot; Then out came large tubs of white emulsion paint and several brushes and the group began painting over the grey concrete walls, stopping occasionally for glasses of water and slices of watermelon. Yosef Ziggerman, 18, a settler from Efrat had been involved in several other, often unsuccessful, attempts to establish new outposts on nearby hills. &quot;I believe every single piece is ours and I don&apos;t see many pieces of land as beautiful as this,&quot; he said. &quot;We aren&apos;t doing anything crazy or fanatic. We&apos;re painting and making it look nice.&quot; Several spoke of their frustration with other Israelis who enjoy the more secular lifestyle of cities like Tel Aviv or Eilat but who seemed not to understand or endorse the settlers&apos; millenarian ideology and their effort to claim the West Bank as their own. Since Israel withdrew its settlers from Gaza four years ago, many fear more compromises and would rather take a more radical and practical stand to expand Jewish settlement of the West Bank. They described themselves as a frontline in a wider struggle against what they see as radical Islam, insisting that settler outposts protect the larger settlement blocs, which in turn protect Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and which in turn protect the Western world. &quot;People like to present us like crazy lunatics,&quot; said Matar. &quot;But one day these people in the West will see. The Muslims are taking over there too. You better be on our side for your sake, but you guys in Europe are not. Those who curse Israel will be cursed, and those who bless Israel will be blessed.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-08-23T19:19:21Z", "title": "West Bank: Slowly, determinedly, settlers bid to build new town", "sentences": ["We&apos;re painting and making it look nice.&quot; Several spoke of their frustration with other Israelis who enjoy the more secular lifestyle of cities like Tel Aviv or Eilat but who seemed not to understand or endorse the settlers&apos; millenarian ideology and their effort to claim the West Bank as their own.", "They described themselves as a frontline in a wider struggle against what they see as radical Islam, insisting that settler outposts protect the larger settlement blocs, which in turn protect Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and which in turn protect the Western world."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/23/west-bank-israeli-settlements"}, {"tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "article": " 10am: Good morning everyone and welcome to our new(ish) rolling sports blog. For those of you who are new to this page, the idea is this: throughout the day we will update this page with news, links, and what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we&apos;ll also try to wade in below the line, answering your questions and comments. SI  10.05am: We&apos;ve just had our morning news meeting. Here&apos;s what&apos;s coming up today: * Several Ashes pressers: Andy Flintoff at 11am, Andy Flower at 1pm and Stuart Broad at 2pm* Liverpool v Aston Villa (8pm)* David James is having a scan today so we should find out whether he&apos;ll miss England&apos;s match with Croatia in a couple of weeks* We may find out whether Cesc F\u00e0bregas will miss next week&apos;s match against Manchester United* There&apos;s also a Harlequins media day SI  10.15am: We&apos;re recording Football Weekly at 11.30am. Any questions for the team (James Richardson, Kevin McCarra, Barry Glendenning and Sean Ingle)? SI  11am: Andy Flintoff is addressing the press, can of Red Bull in hand. His voice is measured and coherent, and there&apos;s certainy no sign of 2005&apos;s day-after goblin grin. He says the celebrations were very different to four years ago - he had a drink with his Dad and the rest of the team. SI  11.15am: Without a doubt, today&apos;s big story has to be ... Joe Calzaghe signing up for Strictly Come Dancing? According to a report in the Western Mail, his uncle Uccio said: &quot;I think he&apos;ll do very well. His grandad was a really good dancer. He used to do tangos and things like that so it is in his blood. Good boxers are light on their feet. Like anything Joe has tackled in his life he has always wanted to be the best and come out best. He will put his heart into it 100%.&quot; JD  11.45am: Good news: tomorrow&apos;s \u00a30.90 Guardian will feature a commemorative 20-page special Ashes supplement. SI  12.20pm: The aftermath of Ashes defeat continues for Australia, with Cricket Australia&apos;s chief executive, James Sutherland, putting his head above the parapet this morning to deliver a nice line in blame deflection:  &quot;I think everyone will be looking for people to blame. I don&apos;t think that in anyway we can hold the selectors accountable for us losing the Ashes. At the end of the day, the players go out and do the business on the field. It was only six or seven months ago that we had fantastic series in South Africa where we beat the No1 team in the world with a pretty similar line-up. The selectors were hailed for their selection, I guess in some ways the perceived risks they took in backing young talent. I think it would be jumping to conclusions to be blaming the selectors for this.&quot;  In the meantime, here are some more Ashes links for you: our Australian paper round-up and Kevin Mitchell&apos;s verdict, having watched the match Down Under. JD             1.20pm - lunchtime links for your perusal: Raphael Honigstein has blogged on the latest round of Bundesliga action, what with Bayern Munich suffering their worst start to a season since 1966; our Talking Horses blog has today&apos;s best bets, plus the chance to compete in our tipping contest; and get our full pre-match Liverpool v Aston Villa preview ahead of tonight&apos;s minute-by-minute report from 7.30pm. JD  2.30pm: If you thought the refereeing was poor at Ashton Gate last weekend, it has nothing on this game in Israel on Saturday night when the referee in Maccabi Tel Aviv v Bnei Sakhin managed to change his mind four times regarding a Tel Aviv goal. JD  3.45pm: In the wake of Britain&apos;s most successful World Championships display since 1999 (gaining six medals, two of each colour), UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee is belatedly receiving some plaudits and now has some collateral with which to push on and target 2012. Speaking this afternoon, Van Commenee admitted:  &quot;The target was five so it&apos;s always clear in this sport, you can always count and at the end say that was a success or it wasn&apos;t. The numbers speak for themselves. I know there was some pessimism in certain circles so it&apos;s always nice at the end of the championships to look back and say that was not necessary. Of course in the end it&apos;s about medals but for the experts you look also into potential and how the team as a bigger group has achieved. Therefore you have to look at the top eight positions (20), I know it&apos;s not very sexy to do that but it gives a good indication for what the team has done as a group. There&apos;s a long way to go but I would rather have this result than going home with two or three obviously.&quot;   JD  5pm: Time on the blog.

From the red ochre of the rock came the name Ma&apos;ale Adumim, Hebrew for the Red Ascent. Today it is a city of more than 30,000 people, with red-roofed apartment blocks, shopping malls, a public swimming pool and ancient olive trees sitting on neat roundabouts. A major highway runs down the hill, across the valley up into the centre of Jerusalem and beyond, connecting conveniently to Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean coast. The rise of Ma&apos;ale Adumim captures the success of Israel&apos;s vast settlement project and the extent of the challenge posed to any future Palestinian state by the settlements and the often overlooked infrastructure of Israel&apos;s occupation. In March 1975 there was no Ma&apos;ale Adumim. After Israel captured and occupied the West Bank in the 1967 war the site was earmarked as a an industrial park. A group of activist settlers from the Gush Emunim \u2014 the Bloc of the Faithful \u2014 arrived one morning and built a water tower and simple concrete hut. They were removed that day by soldiers, but in December that year the first settler families moved in for good. The city then grew exponentially. The site is a compelling example of how infrastructure is used to extend Israel&apos;s reach around and well beyond the settlement. Ma&apos;ale Adumim&apos;s buildings seem to cover one main hilltop, but the municipal area of the settlement is nearly 20 square miles, the size of Tel Aviv. Then there are the Israeli-built roads connecting Ma&apos;ale Adumim with nearby smaller, satellite settlements, as well as a major highway running further east past Jericho and cutting across the West Bank until it reaches the Jordanian border. Israel is now building its steel and concrete West Bank barrier around Ma&apos;ale Adumim and the other smaller settlements, effectively incorporating them on the &quot;Israeli&quot; side and by doing so taking another 24 square miles of the West Bank. To the north and south of Ma&apos;ale Adumim stretches a swath of land that is a closed military area, where access for Palestinians is prohibited. Just across the valley is an area known as E1, where hillsides have been terraced, a police station built and roads laid in preparation for a further 3,500 settler housing units, as well as offices, sports centres, 10 hotels and a cemetery. Other land nearby is designated Area C, a creation of the Oslo accords of the early 1990s, meaning Israel has full administrative and security control. In effect that means no Palestinians can build. So while the apartment blocks of Ma&apos;ale Adumim seem to have a limited though strategic footprint, Israel&apos;s actual control extends much further and deeper into the West Bank. It is a pattern repeated again and again across the West Bank. None of this should be a surprise. It becomes quickly obvious to those who have ever travelled through the West Bank. There are also countless reports from the UN, the World Bank and Israeli and Palestinian groups documenting the reality on the ground. Then there are the often striking admissions from within the establishment. Two years ago Haggai Alon, an adviser to the then Israeli defence minister Amir Peretz, told Ha&apos;aretz that Israel was using the West Bank barrier to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state and that the Israel Defence Force was carrying out an &quot;apartheid policy&quot; in emptying the city of Hebron of Palestinians, setting up roadblocks across the West Bank and co-operating with settlers. &quot;The actual policy of the IDF, especially in recent years, is creating profound changes that threaten to make it impossible to leave the West Bank,&quot; Alon said. &quot;We cannot allow the executive ranks to get us stuck in an irreversible binational situation.&quot; Or look at what Ariel Sharon, former prime minister and self-described pragmatic Zionist, wrote of his post-1967 plans for the Palestinian territories and the importance of control: &quot;What I thought was that, regardless of whatever political solution the future might hold, we would have to keep the high controlling terrain \u2014 to protect and give depth to the tiny heartland along the coast, to be able to defend ourselves on the line of the river Jordan, and to secure Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people forever. That was an indispensable, necessary minimum.&quot; In the 42 years since Israel captured the land, its control has grown apace. There are 149 settlements, together with at least another 100 &quot;outposts&quot; \u2014 smaller settlements unauthorised even by the Israeli government. Nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers now live in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. In order to protect the settlements and, as Israel argues, to impose law and order, came a series of what the UN calls &quot;multi-layered restrictions&quot;: checkpoints, trenches, earth mounds, road gates, roadblocks and a large restricted road network which Palestinians cannot use. Put together they seriously inhibit ordinary life for millions of Palestinians. Then there is the West Bank barrier, begun at the height of the violence of the second intifada and today nearly 60% complete. When finished it will be 450 miles long, running inside the West Bank for 86% of its length. It effectively attaches many of the major settlements to Israel and in doing so places nearly 10% of the West Bank and East Jerusalem on the &quot;Israeli&quot; side. When finished it will leave 35,000 Palestinians living in &quot;closed areas&quot; cut off from the rest of the West Bank and caught between the 1949 armistice line and the barrier. Added to that are the large nature reserves and military closed areas, which Palestinians cannot enter and which are mainly in the Jordan Valley or near the Dead Sea. There are also 48 Israeli military bases. Beyond that, Israel has full control over Area C, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the West Bank. Planning restrictions are tight: 94% of building permit applications have been refused between 2000 and 2007, according to the UN. Today there are around 3,000 pending demolition orders across the West Bank. Instead, the Palestinians are confined to their fragmented urban areas, often behind checkpoints and where talk of a future contiguous, viable Palestinian state seems ever more remote. The effect of this political geography is so striking that even George Bush, who was perhaps the US president most supportive of Israel, was moved early last year to say of a future Palestine: &quot;Swiss cheese isn&apos;t going to work when it comes to the outline of a state.&quot; Others are more direct. In their study Lords of the Land, Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar, an Israeli academic and a journalist, write: &quot;The Jewish settlement, at God&apos;s command and at the government&apos;s will, has thus caused continuing and extensive damage to the basic human rights of the Palestinians who live in the territories, among them the rights to personal liberty, freedom of movement, and property; it has also thwarted any possibility for the realisation of the collective rights of those who lived in the territory before the intrusion of the Israeli forces, such as the right to national self-determination, including statehood.&quot; Lexicon of settlements Settlements Some are large towns with sports centres and public parks, others are caravans or tin shacks on hilltops. All are colonies on land captured by Israel in 1967 and since occupied, and all are therefore in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Natural growth Israel insists settlements must expand at least to cater for natural growth. But the Israeli group Peace Now points out that at least 40% of settler population growth in recent years has been from immigration from Israel or abroad, not from children born in settlements. Consensus Most Israelis expect some of the settlement blocs to remain part of Israel in any future peace deal. They are, in their words, within the consensus. However, this consensus does not extend to the Palestinians or to the international community, who say any land swaps must be negotiated and who regard all settlements as illegal under international law. Price tag Attempts by the Israeli authorities to take down small settler outposts, or houses within outposts, have frequently been met by confrontations with large crowds of angry and often violent settlers. This is called the price tag: the more Israeli authorities act to take down settlements, the more sensitive and challenging a policing operation they will face.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-24T18:15:15Z", "title": "How settlements in the West Bank are creating a new reality, brick by brick", "sentences": ["A major highway runs down the hill, across the valley up into the centre of Jerusalem and beyond, connecting conveniently to Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean coast.", "Ma&apos;ale Adumim&apos;s buildings seem to cover one main hilltop, but the municipal area of the settlement is nearly 20 square miles, the size of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/24/west-bank-settlements-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "Foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics", "G20", "US politics"], "article": "Surely the heart should give a cheer at the hints and signals that suggest Barack Obama will stand before the world next month, either at the UN general assembly or the G20 in Pittsburgh, and launch his own bid for Middle East peace. We have told ourselves for so long that a solution is possible \u2013 that everyone knows the contours of an eventual agreement between Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 that the urge is almost overwhelming to believe it is within reach. After all, here is a president who is internationally admired where his predecessor was reviled; a president apparently alive to the nuances and complexities of this deeply troubled region; above all a president who believes in diplomacy. Surely, if anyone was destined to play the role of Middle East peacemaker, it is Obama. What&apos;s more, the moment seems ripe. For once, large swaths of the Arab world share a common interest with Israel: Saudi Arabia and others fear Tehran more than they fear Tel Aviv, and might be prepared to bury their differences with Israel if that brings united, international action against Iran and its nuclear ambitions. Is it too much to hope that Obama is the right man and September 2009 the right time to bring peace to the Middle East? I fear it might be. The holy land is haunted by the ghosts of men who believed they were uniquely able to succeed where others had failed. Several presidents reckoned they could make the difference \u2013 only to fail. What matters is not the special gifts Obama can boast, but the underlying landscape on which he stands. And, in the Middle East, that does not inspire hope. So it looks encouraging, at first glance, that Israel&apos;s Binyamin Netanyahu is in London today for a long session of talks with George Mitchell, the man who brought balm to Northern Ireland and has been tasked by Obama with doing the same for Israelis and Palestinians. At his press conference alongside Gordon Brown yesterday, the Israeli prime minister made a good fist of suggesting he had narrowed the gap between himself and Obama&apos;s demand for a complete freeze on settlement building in the lands Israel gained in 1967. Of course there would have to be some building in existing settlements \u2013 settlers, explained Bibi, have children who need schools and kindergartens \u2013 but there would be no new ones. Using the language of Israel&apos;s sternest critics, he insisted: &quot;This is very different from grabbing land ... We&apos;re not going to expropriate additional land.&quot; Perhaps he and Mitchell will be able to construct a compromise formula out of that \u2013 agreeing, say, to a one-year building freeze with certain exceptions for &quot;natural growth&quot;. But the Palestinians say they will not agree to any new talks unless Israel submits to a complete freeze. They may well buckle in the end, especially if Washington insists it still believes in the principle of a complete halt to settlement activity. But such an outcome will represent an inauspicious start to a new peace process. In a staring contest with Israel, Obama will be the one who blinked. He will be exposed as weak, unable to persuade a dependent ally to bend to his will. That represents a loss of face for the man who needs both sides to fear him if he is to get results. Let&apos;s say Obama gets over that hump and talks begin. Do we have grounds to be hopeful then? Veteran analyst and sometime negotiator Hussein Agha is not optimistic: &quot;What exactly is the difference between this and Camp David or Annapolis?&quot; Advocates say the novelty is that this effort will be trilateral, with the US a full participant, while George Bush left the two sides to their own devices. But such a view forgets that Condoleezza Rice travelled to the region 17 times in 10 months. And Israelis and Palestinians hardly lacked for US hand-holding in the Clinton era. And it still didn&apos;t work. Indeed, the Camp David talks of 2000 should give further pause. Israel was represented then by Ehud Barak, who had at least some ideological commitment to peacemaking. He faced in Yasser Arafat a Palestinian leader with the authority to sell any deal to his people. A new initiative would pit Netanyahu, who has made a career out of scepticism towards peace, against Mahmoud Abbas, whose legitimacy among Palestinians is fragile. It is surely a stretch to imagine that these circumstances are more conducive to success than those of nine years ago. Some will be encouraged by today&apos;s Guardian report suggesting that the US envisages a two-year timeline, perhaps even a deadline. But then they will remember the speech Bush made in 2003 promising a Palestinian state by 2005. Or they will recall Bush&apos;s promise of statehood by 2008. In the Middle East, deadlines come and go. There is one significant difference this time: Obama himself. Not his negotiating skills, which are unproven, but his standing in the Arab and Muslim world. That is, unequivocally, better than any of his predecessors (though the settlements stand-off is denting it fast). The problem is that it has come at a price: a Jerusalem Post poll in June found that only 6% of Israelis regarded the Obama administration as pro-Israel. That will surely make it that much harder for the US to persuade Israelis to grant the concessions any agreement will need. So, not for the first time, an attempt at peace seems to be facing impossible odds. It is a glum thought: Obama&apos;s effort taking its place alongside Oslo, Camp David and Annapolis as attempts that failed. What can be done? The best approach might be to make the problem apparently harder. For the last two decades, advocates of a two-state solution have sought to reduce the scale of the challenge, to confine a peace process to reversing the effects of 1967, ending the occupation that began that year and letting Palestinians rule the lands they lost. But that is to pretend the conflict began in 1967. It did not. It goes back at least to Israel&apos;s founding in 1948, if not to the arrival of the first Jewish newcomers, determined to rebuild their ancient homeland, in the last years of the 19th century. Perhaps successive efforts at peace have failed because they have ducked the core, existential questions, the issues of 1948. Maybe a true peace will only come when it confronts the hardest issues: on one side, the dispossession of the Palestinians, forced to become a refugee nation; and on the other, the urge which led to Israel&apos;s creation, the Jews&apos; desire after two millennia in exile to live in a state of their own. This will require an entirely new approach. Not a reliance solely on mechanistic formulas, land swaps and compensation packages, but a deep, even emotional engagement with the sources of the conflict. It will mean Israelis finally acknowledging the plight of the refugees created by the birth of the state of Israel, and Palestinians finally deciding whether they can accept a Jewish state. That last move will have to be done without jeopardising the place of those Palestinians who live inside Israel as citizens, or asking Palestinians to reject the entire narrative of their recent history. But something like it will have to be done. Peace has not remained out of reach because the peacemakers did not try hard enough or because the moment was not ripe. Peace may have stayed out of reach because for too long we refused to confront the true causes of this war.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-25T19:45:00Z", "title": "Obama may have to try a wholly new approach on the Middle East | Jonathan Freedland", "sentences": ["For once, large swaths of the Arab world share a common interest with Israel: Saudi Arabia and others fear Tehran more than they fear Tel Aviv, and might be prepared to bury their differences with Israel if that brings united, international action against Iran and its nuclear ambitions."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/25/israel-palestinian-obama-peace-us"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "World news", "US news", "Sport"], "article": "It is a Palestinian academic in London who, in an aside to his speech, mentions that the national basketball team has no one to play against due to the heavy travel restrictions of the West Bank. Intrigued, I come across a new website with details of 18 basketball teams in the West Bank, and six in Gaza. The small print in the bottom left-hand corner reads: &quot;If anyone would like to come and help us, we would be grateful \u2013 T Awartani.&quot; I attempt to contact Mr Awartani (I assume it is a man). Within a week, I receive an email from Tamara Awartani, 27, a Palestinian basketball player. She has created the site to raise the profile of the game there. Awartani, unpaid like all Palestinian players, is raising money to pay professional American basketball players (an admittedly very small amount) to join the men&apos;s league. She soon reports back proudly that 10 Americans are scheduled to fly to Tel Aviv, then travel to towns across the West Bank to join up with different league clubs. Dante Hunter, 27, from Compton, LA, has just arrived in Ramallah when I ring him. Even with his languid west coast accent, he sounds unnerved. &quot;I&apos;m hanging out eating something called falafels; the food&apos;s good but I&apos;m staying out of the streets \u2013 people are demonstrating here against what&apos;s been happening in Gaza.&quot; It seems unfathomable that this young guy, with little idea of where he is, has somehow ended up in the middle of one of the world&apos;s most complex political conflicts, at a time when TV screens are relaying graphic images of wounded citizens amid the shattered remains of their homes. I call Tamara and tell her: &quot;I&apos;ll come over and film the league.&quot; &quot;But have you ever been to a conflict zone before?&quot; a friend and professional cameraman asks me. &quot;Have you ever shot a documentary alone? Do you have any funding?&quot; &quot;Er, no, no and no.&quot; I arrive in Ramallah on a nippy February afternoon earlier this year. As the insurance company has told me when they refused to issue cover for my trip, I am now officially in a &quot;conflict zone&quot;. The Israelis have just finished bombing Gaza, and the West Bank is smouldering with impotent rage. Waiting in the foyer of the Al-Wehdeh hotel for my ride to the basketball league&apos;s opening ceremony in Bethlehem, a battered old BMW blaring hip hop draws up. &quot;Get in!&quot; shouts the woman driver. A young black man sits beside her, and casually waves at me. It is Awartani and Hunter. &quot;Welcome to Palestine!&quot; Hunter beams. &quot;You like to play ball?&quot; I&apos;m not even interested in sport. Growing up in Compton, Hunter tells me he had two choices: &quot;Get into sport, or get into gang banging.&quot; Basketball is a means to an education, travel and a way out of the violence. From what I understand now, being a professional basketball player is like being an actor or musician \u2013 always looking for the next gig, often struggling to earn a living and travelling from place to place to win the approval of the crowd. And this season, Hunter has found himself in Palestine, a country at war. Paid a pittance, he still volunteers to teach basketball to Palestinian children in several schools.  Awartani was born in Ramallah, and grew up in a large, prosperous family. She speaks four languages fluently and plays several sports to professional standard, but works as an IT consultant. To her, basketball represents freedom, a way &quot;to let my soul run free&quot;.  Second to football, basketball is the most popular sport in Palestine. Awartani sees that bringing international professionals to her country will offer the people some hope. As Hunter&apos;s guide, she gently introduces him to the political complexities and daily hardships of living in the occupied territories. I follow them with my friend&apos;s camera. Another day, another match: colourful rows of Yasser Arafat flags zigzagging across the packed indoor court in Nablus. The buzz of hundreds of expectant fans trickles down to the changing rooms where Hunter and his team, Sariyet Ramallah, are warming up.  It has been a long and fraught journey to get to Nablus. Checkpoints and roadblocks are a daily obstacle course for the basketball teams that have to snake their way through the mountainous terrain to get from match to match.  Hunter runs on court with his team, all in their gleaming white kit. Standing on the sidelines, I try to keep up with the action as the players weave up and down the court. Hunter snatches the ball and, after a few lengthy strides, slam dunks it into the net. The metal rim hums with the impact. A group of young men in the front row stand up and chant, &quot;Obama! Obama! Obama!&quot;  A few days later, on the eve of Valentine&apos;s Day, Hunter confides that he wants Awartani to be his valentine. &quot;She&apos;s from Palestine and I&apos;m from California, but we&apos;re the same,&quot; he says, nodding resolutely. Another day, and a car journey to Bethlehem. &quot;Get on the roof!&quot; a team-mate shouts to Hunter. He jumps on the car next to the Separation Wall, and sprays &quot;Free Palestine&quot; in spidery red letters on the grey surface. Reviewing his craftsmanship, Hunter tells his team-mate: &quot;Mine looks sloppy.&quot; They laugh. Above them is a watchtower, surrounded by barbed wire. Then on a clammy April evening, Awartani, gym bag slung over her shoulder, leaves her team practice in East Jerusalem. A flock of Orthodox priests precedes her as she walks wearily toward the bus station. I ask about her forthcoming match and she seems confident. But as we near the bus that will take us through one of the largest Israeli military checkpoints to Ramallah, Tamara explodes with a lifetime of helpless rage. &quot;What is ID? Why should an 18-year-old soldier have the right to stop me and control where I go, what I do, what I say? What is ID? A piece of paper with which people can be racist to you?&quot; Back in London, prospective commissioners seem nervous about taking on my film (they say sports documentaries are notoriously difficult to sell to a wide audience). I say the story is about Awartani and Hunter&apos;s friendship \u2013 but it&apos;s an uphill struggle. Then Hunter emails to say he&apos;s got to leave Palestine. His visa has expired and the Israeli ministry of the interior will not renew it. I jump back on a plane to Tel Aviv. My finances are dwindling drastically. As I arrive, several American basketball players have been refused entry at Tel Aviv airport. Israeli border control has information that they are on their way to play for Palestine. Two players are detained in immigration for several days, then sent back to the US. Awartani is crushed by the news. Finally, I meet up with Hunter again. He is lying on his bed in the Rocky Hotel in Ramallah, flicking through TV channels and refusing to leave, despite the Israeli eviction notice. He explains, simply, that he never drops out of a league mid-season. But Awartani and Hunter&apos;s friendship is buckling under all this tension. She worries about being refused entry to East Jerusalem, dreads those twice-weekly interrogations. Hunter wants to talk but she cannot find the words. Eventually, we all meet on an outdoor basketball court in downtown Ramallah. I film as they talk, argue, and eventually fall silent. Back home a month later, sitting nervously in an edit suite of al-Jazeera&apos;s London office, I review my reams of footage with a very patient editor. I watch Awartani and Hunter&apos;s friendship unfold, then unravel against a backdrop of historical conflict and cultural misunderstandings. There is little hope of resolution.  Hunter and Awartani met through basketball. At a time when the world was again grappling with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the sport brought them kinship and self-determination. In their own ways, they both refused to play ball in the West Bank. \u2022 Salaam Dunk by Hannah Murphy, part of the Witness series, will be broadcast on Al Jazeera English (Sky channel 514) on Sunday, 30 August.

Smith was first given the manager&apos;s job by Murray in 1991, having earlier served as the assistant to Graeme Souness, and completed a run of nine Scottish Premier League titles in succession. Smith returned to the club at the chairman&apos;s behest to begin his second spell in January 2007, since when the club&apos;s fortunes have been revived. &quot;When Graeme Souness left, the environment was different to now and he [Murray] could have gone anywhere to get a new manager,&quot; Smith said. &quot;I had no track record as a manager and he could have gone for someone with a track record behind them. He took a chance on me, gave me an opportunity to get into management, the opportunity I wanted, which could not have been an easy decision to make. I will always be grateful to him for that. &quot;There was no guarantee of a job here at that stage. Maybe I would be back in my old job at Dalmarnock power station now if I had not been kept on, I don&apos;t know.&quot; Murray remains the majority shareholder at Rangers, where he has a 90% stake, but has made it clear the club is for sale. When that transaction does take place, Smith is in no doubt what Murray&apos;s legacy should entail. &quot;If you look at the number of trophies he has won, he has been extremely successful,&quot; the manager said. &quot;He should be remembered for the success he has brought to the club.&quot; Smith could also not resist a dig at a section of the Rangers support, who protested against Murray&apos;s stewardship a year ago. &quot;If he leaves completely \u2013 whether someone takes over the club or not remains to be seen \u2013 someone has a hell of a track record to handle,&quot; he added. &quot;The campaign we saw last season is maybe indicative of what Rangers is all about; it doesn&apos;t really matter what you do for a lot of people, that will not be good enough.&quot; Rangers are boosted by the return of Pedro Mendes and Nacho Novo for their Premier League game against Hamilton tomorrow.

The league failed in a bid to force Israeli ISP Netvision and web portal Nana to reveal the identity of the Israeli owner of LiveFooty.org, a website that used servers based in the country to stream live footage of Premier League matches for nothing. In a judgment that could set a worrying precedent for the Premier League, the Tel Aviv District Court ruled that it was a case of &quot;fair use&quot; since no profit was made from the broadcasts and that, in Israeli law, breach of &quot;broadcasting&quot; copyright only referred to cable or wireless transmission and not streaming over the internet. The judge, Michal Agmon-Gonen, furthermore ruled that the site had important social aims \u2013 &quot;watching sports events is socially important and should remain in the realm of mass entertainment, and not just be for those who can afford it&quot; \u2013 and argued that those who view online were not damaging the revenues of broadcasters. She said they were mainly &quot;those of small means or who are not sufficiently interested in sport to pay&quot;. The Premier League had earlier tried to move the case outside of Israel but the judge blocked the move because the site is based in the country. She also ruled that the identity of the owner would not be revealed and claimed the Premier League had failed to prove any infringement of its rights because online broadcasts were different from television ones. The judge ruled that without clear laws regarding the internet, the court has to choose between the rights of copyrights holders and the rights of the users. The league&apos;s lawyer, Meir Klinger, said of the judgment: &quot;From first impression it looks without a base and wrong. We will appeal to the high court&quot;. Research commissioned last year by a coalition of global rights owners, led by the Premier League and including Major League Baseball, the NBA and NFL, found that up to 1.5m viewers regularly watched football via 177 online illicit feeds. The true figure is almost certainly now higher, given the growth of high speed broadband lines and the increased popularity of watching television over the internet. The growth of the Premier League has been underpinned by the revenues from pay TV broadcasters in the UK and globally \u2013 the current deal is worth \u00a32.7bn over three years, a figure almost certain to be topped by the next contract from 2010 \u2013 and it has been lobbying the government to take action against websites that allow viewers to watch games for nothing and argued that without a strong domestic lead it has less leverage with legislators abroad, most of which are based overseas, many of them in China. Rather than following the example of the music industry, which made enemies of its customers by suing them directly, the Premier League has preferred to employ a specialist company to shut down feeds as they spring up and go after the sites that host them in the courts. The league will later this year face a challenge in the European courts, when UK publicans will argue that decoders bought elsewhere in Europe and imported are legal under free trade laws. That would allow them to show foreign football feeds and blow a hole in the league&apos;s policy of driving up prices by selling its rights on a market by market basis.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-02T21:03:41Z", "title": "Court ruling deals Premier League blow in its fight against pirate websites", "sentences": ["In a judgment that could set a worrying precedent for the Premier League, the Tel Aviv District Court ruled that it was a case of &quot;fair use&quot; since no profit was made from the broadcasts and that, in Israeli law, breach of &quot;broadcasting&quot; copyright only referred to cable or wireless transmission and not streaming over the internet."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/02/premier-league-online-piracy"}, {"tags": ["Hamas", "Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Khaled Meshal, the leader of Hamas, has made a dramatic visit to Cairo amid a new diplomatic effort to secure the release of an Israeli soldier captured near Gaza more than three years ago. Meshal was to meet Omar Suleiman, the Egyptian intelligence chief, who has been the most important mediator between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group in the case of Gilad Shalit. The Israeli soldier, now 23, is believed to be still alive, held somewhere in Gaza by Hamas. Since mid-July, officers from Germany&apos;s foreign intelligence agency, the BND, have been leading a new attempt to broker his release. German officials have made 11 visits to Gaza in the past month, a Hamas spokesman said. A new offer of a prisoner exchange that would see the release of hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails is reportedly on the table. The manoeuvring comes ahead of a critical moment in Israeli-Palestinian relations, with US President Barack Obama hoping to relaunch the Middle East peace process with a deal to freeze Israeli settlement construction on the West Bank. Other senior Hamas figures from Gaza have been in Cairo in recent days, among them Ahmad Jabari, head of the group&apos;s armed wing. The last time he went to Cairo was in the spring, when a previous deal to free Shalit was under intense discussion. However, despite the signs of apparent progress, there have been suggestions from within the Israeli cabinet that a deal is still a long way off. Defence minister Ehud Barak, in particular, has said he refuses to be pressured into a deal. Ten days ago Barak said that, although Israel was committed to bringing Shalit home, it would not accept a deal &quot;at any cost&quot;. It was a startling admission for a country with a conscript army, and where the return of missing soldiers is regarded almost as an unquestionable moral duty. Last Tuesday Barak talked about the Shalit case to a group of Israeli schoolchildren in the Negev, not far from Gaza, telling them &quot;not to whine and not to be spineless... We&apos;ve overcome some very difficult things, and we will face even harder things.&quot;He again said he wanted Shalit freed but &quot;not at any cost, and not under any circumstances&quot;. One student asked if the state would protect his life when he joined the army for national service. &quot;The state cannot protect your life,&quot; Barak replied. &quot;We&apos;re not in western Europe or North America.&quot; Israel, he said, was a place where &quot;whoever is not strong and confident, whoever blinks when faced with Qassam rockets, kidnappings and military cemeteries, cannot survive.&quot; Shalit&apos;s father, Noam, later gave a curt response. His family, he said, &quot;expects less talk, less statements and more actions&quot;. Then last Thursday Yuval Steinitz, the finance minister and a hawk within the Likud party, criticised the campaign for the soldier&apos;s release, saying it \u00ad damaged Shalit&apos;s hopes. &quot;Such campaigns do more harm than good,&quot; he told an Israeli television channel. &quot;It looks very strange when people go to the streets and demonstrate in front of the home of the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] chief of staff over this issue.&quot; He was speaking only days after Shalit&apos;s family marked his 23rd birthday with a large rally at their home in Mitzpe Hila, in northern Israel. The soldier&apos;s mother, Aviva, talked to the crowd about the increasingly dire conditions in Gaza, and said families of Palestinian prisoners were also waiting for their return. &quot;Hundreds of thousands of residents of Gaza are paying a heavy price for this adventure launched by our leaders three years ago,&quot; she said. &quot;With poverty and levelled houses, they can&apos;t allay their suffering.&quot; On the same day, dozens of pro-Shalit protesters gathered outside the defence ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv and called on the government to do more to release him. Some carried signs reading &quot;Barak buried a soldier alive in Gaza&quot;, and &quot;Ashkenazi \u2013 free Shalit or resign&quot;, a challenge directed at Israel&apos;s chief of staff, General Gabi Ashkenazi. Under the reported terms of the latest deal, Israel would agree to release 450 Palestinian prisoners from its jails once Hamas had freed Shalit. Shalit would probably be passed first to Egyptian officials and then to Israel. At a later date, Israel would then free another round of prisoners. More than 7,400 Palestinians are being held in Israeli jails, nearly 400 of them without charge. There are still basic disagreements. It is unclear where the prisoners would go once released. Some reports suggest Israel wants them sent either to Gaza or exiled in other Arab countries. It is also unclear whether Israel is yet prepared to release some of the key prisoners Hamas wants, among them not only senior Hamas figures but also Marwan Barghouti, a popular member of the rival Fatah faction who has been convicted by an Israeli court in connection with five murders, and Ahmad Saadat, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, accused of organising the killing of Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Ze&apos;evi in 2001. If Hamas were to secure the release of hundreds of prisoners in return for Shalit, it would give the group a surge in support. One recent poll suggests support for Hamas stands at 28%, against 44% for Fatah, according to the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. The last time a deal was close was in the spring, in the final days of Ehud Olmert&apos;s term as prime minister. Israel blamed Hamas for changing terms at the last minute. Last month Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, said a deal had been reached at the time on the number of Palestinians to be freed, and that Shalit was to be passed to Egypt, then to Israel. But the deal fell apart. &quot;Israel added certain terms and conditions that impeded progress,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-05T23:07:01Z", "title": "Hamas in talks on freeing kidnapped Israeli soldier", "sentences": ["&quot;With poverty and levelled houses, they can&apos;t allay their suffering.&quot; On the same day, dozens of pro-Shalit protesters gathered outside the defence ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv and called on the government to do more to release him."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/hamas-talks-israeli-soldier-kidnap"}, {"tags": ["DNA database", "Privacy", "UK civil liberties", "UK news"], "article": "For two decades the police and Home Office have insisted that DNA evidence is 100% reliable and that the frantic acquisition of DNA samples from innocent people, as well those convicted of a crime, will make Britain a safer place. But today, on the 25th anniversary of Sir Alec Jeffrey&apos;s discovery of the genetic fingerprint, its worth examining important new research from Israel which proves that DNA evidence can be manipulated and that DNA samples may be fabricated. A disturbing possibility for those whose DNA profiles are kept on the police national DNA database. It is difficult to underestimate the significance of the research by Dr Dan Frumkin and others, published in Forensic Science International Genetics. For one thing it sinks the argument made by Tony Blair and Jack Straw that Britain should opt for a database of everyone&apos;s DNA. Frumkin&apos;s team showed that: \u2022 DNA samples of blood and saliva from a person can be manufactured from someone else&apos;s body fluids. \u2022 Access to a DNA database is all that would be needed to construct a sample of a person&apos;s DNA. No tissue or fluids are necessary. \u2022 Using some of the techniques the team developed, a trace of person&apos;s DNA might be acquired and turned into saliva sample which could be submitted to a genetic testing company in order to discover ancestry or extremely private information about inherited vulnerability to diseases. Speaking to the New York Times, Frumkin said: &quot;You can just engineer a crime scene. Any biology undergraduate could perform this.&quot; The paper reported that the authors of the paper,   &quot;took blood from a woman and centrifuged it to remove the white cells, which contain DNA. To the remaining red cells they added DNA that had been amplified from a man&apos;s hair.Since red cells do not contain DNA, all of the genetic material in the blood sample was from the man. The authors sent it to a leading American forensics laboratory, which analysed it as if it were a normal sample of a man&apos;s blood.&quot;  Frumkin is founder of Nucleix, a Tel Aviv based company which makes much of a authentication technique for assessing whether DNA evidence been fabricated. Clearly he has an interest in selling this kit but this makes his research no less important. John M Butler, leader of the Human Identity testing project at America&apos;s National Institute of Standards and Technology told the New York Times &quot;he was impressed by how well the Frumkin team had fabricated DNA profiles but added, &apos;I think your average criminal wouldn&apos;t be able to something like that.&apos;&quot; Butler has a touching faith in the honesty of America&apos;s police, one that I suggest we would be unwise to imitate here. Police officers in the past have been tempted to &quot;fit up&quot; those they believe guilty of a crime. It is easy to imagine how DNA might, in the future, be manufactured to gain a rock solid conviction against a person who was proving inconvenient to the authorities. We may chose to doubt that this will ever happen but legislators must allow for the possibility. Whatever the advances we celebrate today the actual anniversary of the Jeffrey&apos;s discovery \u2013 it is vital to absorb that DNA evidence is not fool proof. Campaigners for a universal national DNA database, which would contain the samples of everyone in the country, will claim that Frumkin&apos;s techniques allow a court to know when DNA has been manufactured. True, but the important point is that genetic science is developing far faster than the comprehension of politicians. How long will it take before someone develops a means of manufacturing an individual&apos;s DNA without leaving a chemical trace? A few months ago the idea of artificially making a unique genetic profile was unthinkable; now a relatively simply process has blown this assumption out of the water. There are now 800,000 innocent people \u2013 about a fifth of the total number of profiles \u2013 whose DNA is held on the British database. According to Jeffrey, this is a de facto breach of &quot;their genetic privacy&quot;. The European court agrees but leaving the important principle of innocence aside, it is absolutely imperative that people begin to understand that our cavalier attitude to our genetic essence today, could lead to problems and abuse in the future. Look how far we have come in 25 years; imagine what someone&apos;s genetic profile will tell us about them in another 25 years. Like so many complicated technical and moral issues, the use and abuse of DNA needs the engagement of legislators who have the credentials to square up to the new science. But look at both front benches, you won&apos;t find many scientists, or moral philosophers for that matter.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-10T10:37:09Z", "title": "Faked DNA evidence torpedoes certainty  | Henry Porter", "sentences": ["The authors sent it to a leading American forensics laboratory, which analysed it as if it were a normal sample of a man&apos;s blood.&quot;  Frumkin is founder of Nucleix, a Tel Aviv based company which makes much of a authentication technique for assessing whether DNA evidence been fabricated."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/sep/10/dna-research-fabricated"}, {"tags": ["Rangers", "Celtic", "Stuttgart", "Champions League", "Scottish Premiership", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2009-10", "Scottish Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "With the national team&apos;s World Cup aspirations in pieces and Scotland&apos;s other representatives in Europe already a memory, the Old Firm are left, once again, to carry the tartan banner into the foreign field. They will probably do so accompanied by a peculiar mixture of excitement and dread. Celtic&apos;s followers are never likely to forgive Gordon Strachan for what they perceive as his meek surrender of the league championship, thereby denying the team automatic entry to the group stages of the Champions League. They are, however, grateful for the victory over Dinamo Moscow in their first qualifying tie, which guaranteed their appearance in the Europa League after defeat by Arsenal in the play-off for a place in the premier tournament. Coming as early as it did in the season \u2013 it was their first competitive match \u2013 the joust with the Moscow side threatened to evict Celtic from the continental theatre before the curtain had gone up. Even Strachan&apos;s successor, Tony Mowbray, regards them as fundamentally better equipped for the lesser competition and the club&apos;s supporters will, by and large, be thankful not to have taken the route into oblivion followed by Rangers last season, when they capitulated to FBK Kaunas of Lithuania. A group that includes Hamburg and Rapid Vienna, and that starts with Thursday&apos;s trip to Tel Aviv to confront Hapoel, may be considerably less sexy than some of the Champions League epics that have captivated at Celtic Park in recent years. But a tenancy that is guaranteed to last until the middle of December \u2013 and which could be extended even by finishing third in a group of four \u2013 has its consolations. There is little doubt, however, that the green half of Glasgow will be appropriately coloured as they look enviously towards Ibrox, where Rangers prepare for their Champions League campaign in a group that could not have offered more potential for success had Walter Smith been allowed to pick his own rivals. The top seeds are Sevilla, the third-best team in Spain, while Rangers were placed in the second layer thanks to a combination of results in the qualifiers that promoted the Scottish champions from the third pot. Their place was taken by VfB Stuttgart, fourth best in Germany last season, and the group is completed by little-known Romanians Unirea Urziceni, first-time winners of their domestic title. Rangers encountered Stuttgart on their last visit to the group stage, two years ago, and their 2-1 victory in the opening match at Ibrox was followed by a 3-2 defeat in Germany. Rangers finished third in the group, the Germans on the bottom, and Smith&apos;s side went on to reach the Uefa Cup final. Again, they confront Markus Babbel&apos;s team on matchday one \u2013 this time in Germany, on Wednesday \u2013 and Smith contends, once again, that there will be little between the teams. &quot;Markus was assistant manager the last time we met,&quot; said Smith, &quot;so, although they have changed personnel, as we have, there will be little change to how they play. They have acquired some top-class players, including Alexander Hleb and the Russian striker, Pavel Pogrebnyak, both of whom could cause anyone bother. &quot;Pogrebnyak played for Zenit St Petersburg when we played them in the Uefa Cup final, but we were very glad when he got himself suspended for the match. He is strong, quick and a good finisher. He was top scorer, with 10, in that Uefa Cup run they had. So he&apos;ll be a danger all right. &quot;We&apos;ve changed in that we have more of a footballing midfield now, with more emphasis on retaining the ball and less on preventing the other team from playing. But we&apos;ll have to impose that style at this level.

Firth earned the prize for his performance as gay literature academic George Falconer in the film A Single Man, based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood and directed, in his film debut, by fashion designer Tom Ford. Firth is married to an Italian and spends much of his time there. Speaking after his triumph, Firth told the Observer: &quot;I rarely seem to come home from Italy empty-handed \u2013 wine, balsamic vinegar, wife, two children, and now a nice piece of silverware.&quot; He had earlier given his acceptance speech in Italian saying the win was &quot;possibly the greatest honour of my life&quot;. The 49-year-old actor, who celebrated his birthday at the 66th festival two days before the awards, has never won a major award before, despite Bafta nominations for his parts in Pride and Prejudice and Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary. But his sensitive and touching portrayal of a gay man plunged into a mid-life crisis after the accidental death of his lover could see him secure an Oscar nomination. Set in Los Angeles in 1962, and marked by tasteful costumes, music and production design as well as fine performances, the film impressed critics and audiences at the festival. It also stars Julianne Moore and young British actors Matthew Goode and Nicholas Hoult.\u00a0 Ford has called A Single Man the &quot;most personal and artistically satisfying project&quot; of a glittering career which previously saw him turn around the fortunes of fashion label Gucci and its parent company LVMH, before setting up a successful menswear label. He recently designed the suits for Daniel Craig&apos;s James Bond in Quantum of Solace. Firth&apos;s win was an extremely popular choice by the jury, whose president this year was the Oscar-winning director Ang Lee. Firth is the latest in a line of British performers to win at Venice, including Imelda Staunton, Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent, and stretching back to Tom Courtenay, Albert Finney and John Mills. The festival&apos;s big winner, however, was a far more controversial choice. The Golden Lion for best film went to an Israeli entry called Lebanon. Directed by Samuel Maoz, it is set entirely inside a tank containing four young, inexperienced Israeli soldiers during the first days of the 1982 war in Lebanon. The intense, claustrophobic film is based directly on the filmmaker&apos;s traumatic experiences as a tank gunner during the war and it took him more than 25 years to write the script without being physically sick from the memory. The award marks the highest honour accorded an Israeli film and comes as attendees and organisers at the Toronto Film Festival, a big rival to Venice, are being urged by famous figures including Ken Loach, Danny Glover and Jane Fonda to protest against the decision to highlight a section focusing on film production in Tel Aviv. Speaking exclusively to the Observer, Maoz said: &quot;The point of a film like mine is to open a dialogue, to get people talking to each other about important issues. This is something you can&apos;t do if films are boycotted. It makes no sense to boycott art. Maybe I wouldn&apos;t have won if Jane Fonda was on the jury, but she wasn&apos;t.&quot; The film, with its powerful anti-war message, has proved controversial in Israel. Although it has not yet been widely released, some commentators have raised concerns that the film will deter young men from volunteering for the army. According to the director, there were powerful figures in Israel opposed to the film competing at Venice. &quot;I suppose every filmmaker has the naive, even pathetic dream that his film could be the one that finally stops a war,&quot; said Maoz. &quot;But making this film has got me my life back and that is more precious than any award. Without fully knowing it, I have been deeply traumatised since 1982, as has a whole generation of Israelis, people who are now running the country. Making Lebanon and finally confronting what happened in that war, has given me my true feelings back and I can cry real tears once more.&quot; The festival&apos;s second prize, The Silver Lion, was awarded to feminist Iranian artist Shirin Neshat, for her striking film Women Without Men. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 16 September 2009.

Georgios Samaras, who had his header from Scott Brown&apos;s cross ruled out, argued, with a degree of legitimacy, that his effort was good. &quot;I was onside 100%, I was with the defender and when I made my move, I was definitely onside.&quot; The assertions of Celtic&apos;s manager, Tony Mowbray, that if the goal had stood his team &quot;would have won 2-1&quot; were slightly more dubious as there was still half an hour left to play. Worse was to come for Mowbray, with Celtic denied a penalty in stoppage time as Darren Dods handled inside the area. Even Dundee United&apos;s manager, Craig Levein, joked: &quot;He feels he should have held it.&quot; Levein had his own complaint with the free-kick which led to Scott McDonald heading Celtic&apos;s equaliser. Dods was penalised for handball but Levein said: &quot;I had a great view of it. I watch football on television 24/7 and nowadays that is not a free-kick. If Darren Dods is eight to 10 yards away and puts his hand up to try and stop the ball then I can accept that but he was too close to the ball to have been judged to deliberately handle it. And I&apos;ve yet to see anybody who can jump to try and block a cross with his hands by their side.&quot; Dods thought that his later good luck evened things up. &quot;It hit my head then hit my thumb and bounced away but I think we were unfortunate in the first half,&quot; he said. &quot;I had my hands by my side and the referee didn&apos;t give it but the linesman did.&quot; David Goodwillie had lashed United, who join the Old Firm as the unbeaten teams in the Scottish Premier League, in front after just six minutes. The only surprise was that there were no further goals. That would have delighted Rangers, who had earlier dropped two points at Motherwell, and Levein as well. The United manager will be under consideration by the Scottish Football Association if George Burley is sacked as the international manager; given his team&apos;s showing here, it is perfectly easy to see why. The visitors lost Scott Robertson to a red card in the dying stages following two bookings, a decision Levein thought justified. &quot;I can&apos;t argue with the sending-off,&quot; Levein said. &quot;Scott had three fouls and had been booked, and was booked again.

She continued: &quot;In the hyper-sensitised reality of the region in which any criticism of Israel is swiftly and often unfairly branded as anti-Semitic, it can become counterproductive to inflame rather than explain and this means to hear the narratives of both sides, to articulate the suffering on both sides, not just the Palestinians. By neglecting to do this the letter allowed good people to close their ears and their hearts.&quot; However Fonda pointed out that her decision had been based on anger over the suspicion that Toronto was being used by the Israeli government to boost its newly launched campaign to &quot;rebrand&quot; the country. &quot;Arye Mekel, the Israeli foreign ministry&apos;s director general for cultural affairs, has said that artists and writers must be enlisted in order to &apos;show Israel&apos;s prettier face, so we are not thought of purely in the context of war&apos;,&quot; she said. &quot;The protesters felt it was wrong for the much-respected festival to be used in this manner.&quot; The original protest letter was written by a group of Toronto-based film-makers angered by the festival&apos;s decision to put Tel Aviv at the centre of its inaugural City to City programme. It was then signed by more than 1,500 supporters, including director Guy Maddin, actor Viggo Mortensen, author Naomi Klein and musician David Byrne. Yesterday the film-makers held a press conference refuting claims they advocated a boycott of the festival over the Tel Aviv focus. Speaking alongside Toronto film-maker John Greyson and Palestinian-Israeli director Elia Sulieman, among others, proponent Elle Flanders said the letter was not targeted at Israeli film-makers themselves, &quot;but rather the frame&quot;.

He told the Observer: &quot;The point of a film like mine is to open a dialogue, to get people talking to each other about important issues.

The wallpaper and carpet never seemed to match, and Jim Reeves would be crooning from the Blue Spot radiogram on a Sunday. This room was based on the Victorian parlour and was inscribed with a formal code of behaviour because it was reserved for receiving guests. It was packed with furniture, ornaments and soft furnishings surrounded by a gallery of pictures and photographs. But why would I be interested in \u00ad doing a book about it? The reasons lie in understanding how such rooms have shaped identity. More than 35,000 visitors of different ages, genders and social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds visited The West Indian Front Room, an exhibition and installation that I curated at the Geffrye Museum in east London in 2005-06. They experienced moments of embarrassment, recognition and identification, as well as the expression of working-class respectability in the home. The front room resonated emotionally on an inter-generational level beyond simply the black British domestic homes but with other migrant diasporas, from Lagos to Peckham, Dublin to Kilburn, Delhi to Southall, Nicosia to Wood Green, Tel Aviv to Golders Green. Colonialism meant that my parents&apos; generation was imbued with English culture, and they saw themselves as British citizens coming to the &quot;Mother Country&quot;. Many West Indian migrants eventually acquired homes and created front rooms in which they could express their social and cultural values. As sociologist and broadcaster Stuart Hall tells us: &quot;The front room is a conservative element of black domestic life, which is more complex and rich than the generality of the society ever realises&quot;. Furthermore, Caribbean culture has no one true point of origin, which means that, aesthetically, the West Indian front room is a hybrid based on West Indian and English tastes. One of the images used in the book has a wooden cabinet radiogram at the centre, which stood like a religious object in many Caribbean homes. Since many West Indians, especially men, were excluded from white male-dominated pubs and clubs, entertainment took place in the home with music played on the radiogram. And whether it was bluebeat, calypso, ska, reggae or soul, it enabled us to reconnect with our original selves through song, rhythm and dance. \u2022 Michael McMillan is author of The\u00a0Front Room, published by Black Dog, \u00a319.95.

But Israel has proven to be a protest too far as the veteran actor and political activist backs away from an increasingly bitter dispute among Hollywood names over a film festival that has been variously branded as an Israeli propaganda stunt and a showcase for the achievements of the Jewish state. Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Lenny Kravitz and Natalie Portman are among those who have put their names to an open letter denouncing a campaign against this year&apos;s Toronto film festival spotlight on Tel Aviv to mark the Israeli city&apos;s centenary. One Oscar-winning producer has gone so far as to describe the campaign as intended to destroy Israel. But backers of the protest against the celebration of Tel Aviv - who include Ken Loach, Julie Christie and Harry Belafonte - say that the organisers have been duped in to joining a propaganda campaign after a senior Israeli diplomat in Canada said he was targeting the film festival as part of a multimillion-dollar push to improve the Jewish state&apos;s image abroad. Fonda was among hundreds of artists and activists who put their names to an open letter to the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) objecting to Tel Aviv being chosen as the first of its City to City showcases. A Canadian director pulled his documentary in protest, and two Egyptian films were withdrawn. TIFF has denied it is being used and said Israel&apos;s largest city was selected because, like Toronto, it is a diverse metropolis. But the open letter, known as the Toronto Declaration, says that to celebrate Tel Aviv without talking about occupation or this year&apos;s bloody attack on Gaza is &quot;like rhapsodising about the beauty and elegant lifestyles in white-only Cape Town or Johannesburg during apartheid without acknowledging the corresponding black townships of Khayelitsha and Soweto&quot;. &quot;We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City, nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF. However, especially in the wake of this year&apos;s brutal assault on Gaza, we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign on behalf of what South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former US President Jimmy Carter, and UN General Assembly President Miguel d&apos;Escoto Brockmann have all characterised as an apartheid regime,&quot; the protest letter says. Among those endorsing the declaration are the actors Danny Glover, the musician David Byrne and the writer Alice Walker. The activists Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky have also backed the protest. The declaration notes that last year the Israeli government and three major Canadian media companies launched a multimillion-dollar &quot;Brand Israel&quot; campaign to &quot;take the focus off Israel&apos;s treatment of Palestinians and its aggressive wars, and refocus it on achievements in medicine, science and culture&quot;. It also points to an interview by the Israeli consul general in Canada, Amir Gissin, in which he said that Toronto had been chosen as a test city by the Israeli foreign ministry to rebrand the Jewish state&apos;s image abroad and boasted that he would use the film festival as part of the campaign. &quot;I&apos;m confident that everything we plan will happen,&quot; Gissin told the Canadian Jewish News. Klein says that Gissin has indeed got his way and that the TIFF organisers have been duped in to playing along with the Israeli government&apos;s desire to portray the country as a tolerant liberal democracy. The protest is also supported by some prominent Israelis including the film-maker, Udi Aloni, who wrote an open letter to other Israeli directors saying he is concerned about the showing of their films at the festival. &quot;You are becoming ambassadors, or PR spokesmen, for the state, blurring the wrongs of the occupation, by imbuing Israel with a liberal scent. By participating in these types of events you might, together with numerous Israeli film-makers, find yourself participating in the dirty job of branding Israel as a hip western democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you with us or with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs? ... I am afraid that nowadays one cannot belong on both sides!&quot; Fonda initially threw her weight behind the declaration but has since backed away amid a furious campaign against the protest. Pro-Israel organisations in Los Angeles and Toronto won support from a number of Hollywood names \u2013 including Lisa Kudrow, Adam Arkin, Jason Alexander and Baron Cohen who has family in Israel - for a petition headed: &quot;We don&apos;t need another blacklist&quot;. &quot;Anyone who has actually seen recent Israeli cinema, movies that are political and personal, comic and tragic, often critical, knows they are in no way a propaganda arm for any government policy,&quot; it says. &quot;Blacklisting them only stifles the exchange of cultural knowledge that artists should be the first to defend and protect.&quot; Rabbi Marvin Hier, who has won two Oscars as a producer of documentaries about the Holocaust and who founded the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, has accused supporters of the Toronto Declaration of seeking to eradicate Israel. &quot;People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the state of Israel,&quot; he said. The declaration&apos;s organisers have hit back by saying they did not call for a boycott or blacklisting and that their petition is being distorted in order to discredit it. That did not stop Fonda from changing her mind and backing away from the declaration on the grounds that it was &quot;unnecessarily inflammatory&quot; because it didn&apos;t mention Hamas and other issues. &quot;I signed the letter without reading it carefully enough, without asking myself if some of the wording wouldn&apos;t exacerbate the situation rather than bring about constructive dialogue,&quot; Fonda wrote on the Huffington Post&apos;s website.

Combining biology with electronics, Sefi Vernick, a PhD student at Tel Aviv University, hopes to provide just that. By adding lab-on-a-chip technology to an endoscope, his work should enable doctors to test for cancer biomarkers during internal examinations. Vernick is working on biosensors, mainly electrochemical, for cancer detection as part of a group effort to develop biomedical devices. As the third-most common cancer, early diagnosis is important. &quot;It&apos;s also widely accepted that, since cancer is the sum of many cellular events manifesting in many ways, the solution lies in multi-target strategies. A simultaneous detection of biomarkers may increase level of confidence [for detection] considerably,&quot; says Vernick. Biomarkers are commonly used in medical diagnostics to indicate a disease state. Cancer biomarkers are molecular changes detectable in the tumour as well as blood, urine or other body fluids with these telltale signs being produced in the tumour or by the body itself. But there&apos;s a problem: &quot;CRC [colorectal cancer] is a greater challenge since its biomarkers aren&apos;t sufficiently specific.&quot; Endoscopes allow doctors to examine the rectum and colon, take biopsy samples, and remove small polyps that may develop into cancers. By fitting lab-on-a-chip technology to an endoscope, cancer biomarkers are detectable too. &quot;This tool allows us to both visualise and remove polyps and screen for cancer in real time.&quot;. At the moment, he relies on the presence of a single biomarker for healthy cells not found in cancer cells. The lab-on-a-chip acts as an electrochemical biosensor for this biomarker (which catalyses the substrate) with electrodes transducing a signal into a measurable electric current. Filters help reduce biological noise within this &quot;highly sensitive&quot; method. The research, which is partly funded by American-Israeli businessman and philanthropist Lester Crown, also hopes to add further cancer biomarkers to increase the level of confidence in the results. The new research is welcomed by Dr Alison Ross, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK. &quot;There are many questions that need answering before we know whether this potential new test is accurate and reliable and provides benefits over existing methods,&quot; she says. &quot;This new technology is just one example of the huge research effort to identify biomarkers that can aid cancer diagnosis. But any new way of speeding up the diagnosis of bowel cancer would be very \u00ad welcome.&quot; Ross also points out that when cancer is detected early, treatment is often simpler and more likely to be effective.

But Rangers&apos; 1-1 draw with Stuttgart, in Germany, in the opening game of their Champions League group campaign, was emphatically more impressive than Celtic&apos;s torturous 2-1 defeat by Hapoel in Tel Aviv. Indeed, the lamentations among fans of the Parkhead club after the reversal in their first Europa League group match suggest Tony Mowbray is already on probation, just weeks into his first season as successor to Gordon Strachan. The big Englishman seemed remarkably unconcerned by the hostility that appeared to gush in his direction from websites and forums in the wake of a second-half collapse that led to the ultimately meek capitulation of his team, after they had finished a first half of domination with a one-goal lead through Georgios Samaras. He was, instead, more insistent on emphasising that it is his players who are on probation as he goes about fulfilling his pledge to make Celtic in his own image. In outlining his objective, Mowbray was uncommonly candid in his appraisal of his present resources and equally forthright about how long it is likely to take to effect improvement. &quot;What you need, above all, is a squad you can trust,&quot; Mowbray said. &quot;That means one where it doesn&apos;t matter, by and large, who&apos;s playing and who&apos;s not because they are all top players. You have 20 to 24 players who will serve your purposes. &quot;I inherited a squad who&apos;ve been mainly successful and who lost a few, including real contributors like Shunsuke Nakamura and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. But I see my own squad and my own team developing over the next few years. We have a few transfer windows to get through before we get to acquiring the players who will take us anywhere near where we would want to be. &quot;Where I want to be is where I have the kind of players who can play the way I want to play. So far, we&apos;re only through one transfer window and we&apos;ve brought in a few, but, maybe, I&apos;ll have a much better idea by the next window about who should be coming and who should be going. In Tel Aviv, for example, I\u00a0didn&apos;t see a team I&apos;d like to stick a stamp on and say that&apos;s the team I want. &quot;Their retention of the ball is not good enough, certainly not for what&apos;s required at a good level in Europe. I would like to have a team who can control matches and take full advantage of that control, week in, week out. At the moment, I&apos;m miles away from what I would consider my ideal.&quot; Wish fulfilment for Mowbray sounds like an expensive exercise and he is likely to be badgering a famously prudent board of directors at a time when funds are conspicuously more difficult to release than Ronnie Biggs and the Lockerbie bomber. When he talked of a few transfer windows to be got through, he may have needed more than one hand to count them. In this respect, his rival at Ibrox, Walter Smith, has shown extraordinary\u00a0deftness. Smith seems to have a gift for unearthing players equipped with the hardness of spirit and energetic commitment that comply with his playing style at those times when virtuosity is at a premium. Madjid Bougherra, the marauding central defender who delivered Rangers&apos; equaliser in Stuttgart, would be a prime example.

The crisis has come like an avenging angel to cleanse the earth and art with it. In this final reckoning, there will be no place for the hedonistic nihilism of the last 20 years, nor for the artists who have become playthings of the rich. Only politics can save us now. All that remains is to pickle Damien Hirst, stuff Sarah Lucas and put Tracey Emin to bed. The tumbrils that took Bernie Madoff and Lehman Brothers will soon be back for Saatchi and Serota. And as if on cue, Istanbul was deluged on the biennial&apos;s opening night by an apocalyptic storm, one that killed 32 people in a suburb built on sand during the last speculative building boom. Art biennials are expensive, often largely irrelevant affairs, and not usually marked by calls for a new world order. But Istanbul&apos;s curators, the Croatian all-female collective What, How &amp; for Whom, are seeking nothing less than a refounding of art on Brechtian principles, as a motor for social change. Art, they say, has lost its way, while the public (who spend less than 30 seconds in front of the average video piece) are too gullible to notice. A crack force of right-thinking artists \u2013 the dead as well as the living \u2013 has been assembled to support their argument. Administration of Terror, by the Paris-based group Bureau d&apos;Etudes, sets out scientifically to link the banks, intelligence agencies and shadowy business networks that secretly rule the world; American artist Trevor Paglen is tracking the spy satellites that fly over Istanbul. The floors are strewn with the crumpled pages of human rights reports on Turkey; questionnaires ask gallerygoers if we think the event is &quot;politically instructive enough for the audience&quot;. The end has already come in Jesse Jones&apos;s video piece, Mahogany, a masterful rejigging of Bertolt Brecht&apos;s bitter fable about the fall of a city dedicated to pleasure, shot in the same arid patch of Australian dirt as Mad Max. The city&apos;s messiah (who looks not unlike Sam Taylor-Wood) boasts that there is nothing that cannot be done in this free-market heaven; banners roll across the desert: &quot;For Love, For the Selling of Love, For the Just Division of Spiritual Goods, For the Unjust Division of Temporal Goods, For Brute Stupidity, For Property, For the Rich&quot;. The biennial&apos;s manifesto claims that &quot;politically neutral art is a means of policing the art world&quot;. Then comes the rub: it believes in a just world order, but &quot;communism is still the only name for that desirable project&quot;. And no, nobody&apos;s laughing. To prove the point, the Russian collective Chto delat re-examine the whole Soviet project and its aftermath before proposing an alternative version. Yet somehow the biennial escapes its own rhetoric, particularly in the venues furthest from its base on the Bosphorus. The recently abandoned Greek school in Sisli \u2013 where little Greeks were turned into little Turks \u2013 has some of the most interesting work, even if this potent symbol of slow-drip ethnic cleansing at first threatens to overwhelm it. Israeli film-maker Avi Mograbi has taken Brecht at his word by producing his own version of The Threepenny Opera, in which a commando wrestles with his conscience over his part in the murder of an unarmed Palestinian policeman. Mograbi&apos;s Tel Aviv neighbours, Ruti Sela and Maayan Amir, mine a parallel vein of men and their weapons by filming their hotel-room encounters with men they have met online. The new political art is at least funny: in Unemployed Employee: I Have Found You a Job!, young people from Istanbul fold and unfold fashion T-shirts for the minimum wage in a mock boutique. Elsewhere, artists have taken up arms where mainstream politics and journalism are failing: an architectural project tries to find solutions to the occupation of the West Bank; Rena Effendi&apos;s photographs document the damage wrought by the new oil pipeline that feeds Europe. Curiously, the biennial has not risked going out on to the streets, strange at a time when protest has become almost a branch of performance art. There is also more than a whiff that this is eastern Europe&apos;s revenge on the lingering prejudice that its art is second-rate, permanently &quot;in transition&quot;. So has political art really arrived? Or do these artists protest too much? As the biennial was installed, Istanbul police raided a house in a wealthy suburb where nine young women had been held by a TV company that had promised to make them stars. After over a month of being filmed by hidden cameras, only one girl complained. Charles Saatchi&apos;s &quot;X Factor for artists&quot; starts on BBC2 in November, to coincide, of course, with his first show of British art in St Petersburg. Saatchi will play himself as the unseen Big Brother pulling the strings, representing pure capital.

Rose Tremain&apos;s Orange prize-winning The Road Home and a translation of Muriel Barbery&apos;s The Elegance of the Hedgehog are both current bestsellers; bookshops are stacked with a comprehensive range of contemporary fiction in translations from around the world, from writers as far apart in location as Haruki Murakami and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. But one distinct geographical body of work is scarcely represented amid this largesse: contemporary literature from Israel&apos;s closest neighbours in the Arab world. Arab writing is not completely invisible, to be sure; one can find, for instance, a translation of Mahfouz&apos;s Cairo Trilogy without too much difficulty. But this is the exception, rather than the rule. The literary curiosity of Hebrew readers seems to do something of a hop and a skip over their next-door neighbours before settling in further flung climes. One shouldn&apos;t be surprised by this state of affairs, of course; the parlous relationship between Israel and the Arab world makes it all the more difficult to engage with the &quot;other&quot; in terms beyond the mistrustful and belligerent. Many Israelis still define their country as a small nation surrounded by its enemies; in this context, there is little appetite to consider the Arab world in anything other than the most uncomplicated and reductive of terms. This is a shame. Israelis, I think, have a genuine interest in the wider world: the popularity of translated literature bears testament to this. Literature, I believe, has the capacity to illuminate and inform, to add nuance and depth to the understanding of the people and societies about whom books are concerned. Without meaningful cultural engagement - and representation - it is only too easy to reduce the &quot;other&quot; to a set of stereotypes and caricatures. But there are attempts, small yet meaningful, to introduce Arabic literature to the Hebrew-reading public. One example is Tel Aviv-based Andalus Books. The publishing house takes its inspiration from the &quot;golden era&quot; of intellectual thought and activity in the Iberian peninsula, a time when &quot;Arabic and Jewish cultures fed and fertilised one another ...(when) texts were translated and ideas exchanged freely from Arabic to Hebrew and vice versa&quot;. Many Israelis have little direct knowledge about Arabic society and culture, and the aspiration of Andalus is to &quot;fill this vacuum by translating books that will cover social, cultural and political issues as expressed through Arabic literary, poetic and expository writings&quot;. Thus far, they have published 22 titles, including works by Mohammed Berrada, Mahmoud Darwish, Taha Muhammad Ali, and Elias Khoury. One could argue that the Israeli situation is little different from that elsewhere in the western world, where the recent success of writers such as Alaa al-Aswany merely belies the anonymity of most literary work from the Arab world. But in Israel, the stakes are higher: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is fuelled, in part, by an ignorance of the &quot;other&quot;. Fighting this ignorance is clearly a move in the right direction. The same principle operates both ways, of course. There is very little Israeli literature translated into Arabic, even in the countries - Egypt and Jordan - that maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel. Farouk Hosni, the Egyptian minister of culture and nominee to head Unesco, has been widely reported to have threatened - in Egypt&apos;s parliament, of all places - to burn all the Israeli books in the country&apos;s libraries. But even here, there is cause for optimism. Recently - and perhaps in response to the furore caused by Hosni&apos;s remarks - it was announced that the Egyptian ministry of culture will permit translations, for the first time, of works by two of Israel&apos;s leading writers, Amos Oz and David Grossman. (Not translated directly from Hebrew, mind, but we shan&apos;t dwell on this, at least not today. That&apos;s another story and a half.) It is important not to get too excited. Attitudes ingrained over generations of strife cannot evolve overnight. But it is a step, small but definite, towards creating a cultural detente between the two sides. Incremental change is better than none at all: in any case, it is only through exposure to the &quot;other&quot; that a greater tolerance can be fostered, something that can contribute to progressive improvements in bi- and multilateral relations between Israel and the Arab world.

It would be unwise to suggest one overseen by Tony Mowbray will be any different. Gary Caldwell, on face value, would be an unlikely fall guy as Mowbray looks to put his own imprint on Celtic Park. A regular starter, made the team captain thanks to Stephen McManus&apos;s early-season injury absence and a player with whom Mowbray worked at another club, Hibernian, Caldwell, one would think, should be an integral part of Celtic&apos;s future. Yet the timing of the defender&apos;s recent criticism of his club&apos;s hierarchy may prove significant. Amid an impasse over an extension of Caldwell&apos;s contract, which is due to expire next summer, he claimed Celtic are &quot;kidding themselves&quot; with the terms on offer. Caldwell feels seriously undervalued, believing the offer is less than what some of his fellow first-team regulars take home every week. His blast was reported on the very day Celtic were to play Hapoel Tel Aviv in their Europa League opener. Right on cue, the visitors played poorly in Israel, with Caldwell, who has blundered his way through the start of the season for club and country, one of the guilty men. It is hypocritical to castigate a player for airing his opinions in the media; such words, after all, fill pages. What is legitimate, though, is to question Caldwell&apos;s timing. He is a player who never shies away from interviews but he could surely have picked a better juncture to air his contract worries. The exact details, as ever, are cloudy. Reports suggest Caldwell is seeking \u00a319,000 a week, more than double his current salary. It is to the credit of his representatives that he has not commented regularly on talks \u2013 or the lack of them \u2013 with the Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell. Caldwell is neither a stand-out nor a rotten player. His value, more to the point, is impossible to quantify at this moment. Can anybody legitimately say a top SPL player is worthy of a \u00a31m-a-year salary? Or is it the case that Caldwell simply contributes as much to his team as Scott Brown, understood to collect close to \u00a325,000 a week? Mowbray was an unwilling participant in discussions regarding Caldwell a week ago, but made it plain that he will not bend over backwards to plead the player&apos;s case. The manager&apos;s further assertions that he is &quot;nowhere near&quot; being content with the team at his disposal and that it will take &quot;at least two transfer windows&quot; before that is the case does not augur well for Caldwell. It was the manager, moreover, who volunteered the word &quot;downsizing&quot;. Financial realities \u2013 not least due to a lack of Champions League football this season \u2013 will prove a significant hurdle to Mowbray. Within a matter of weeks in office, the former West Brom manager has said enough to leave the impression that he is up for major surgery at his new club. And there may well be perfect justification to do so; a sense of flatness, the sensation that something is not quite right with Celtic&apos;s play has not lifted since midway through last season. Even supporters realise that, if the atmosphere at Celtic games is anything to go by. Trying to overhaul a team while maintaining financial prudence comes at a price; that price being players who had earlier been seen as untouchable. Caldwell, either confident or fully aware he can collect the exact salary he wants elsewhere, will surely be allowed to leave if it means Mowbray can utilise a potential wage more usefully. Such a scenario may be mutually beneficial. Caldwell will watch Christophe Berra, who moved south from Hearts, earning rave reviews in the Premier League with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Caldwell&apos;s brother, Stephen, is also a regular starter in England&apos;s top flight. Maybe testing one&apos;s ability against genuinely top-class strikers is more valuable than pounds on a wage slip. There are some curious goings-on at Celtic, in any case. The apparent willingness to let McManus move on a loan deal to Ipswich Town before the transfer window closed was bemusing. Ticket sales are likely to struggle for upcoming Europa League games \u2013 the number of ad hoc PR initiatives tells you that \u2013 against a backdrop of a challenging economic climate. Even at this stage in Mowbray&apos;s reign, it would hardly be a shock if Scott McDonald is entering his final months at Celtic, regardless of an impressive goals ratio. Aiden McGeady, too, could be in his last season at Parkhead although that is more related to the winger&apos;s desire for a fresh challenge than what transfer fee he could attract.

The national football stadium in the Ramat Gan suburb of Tel Aviv has been the scene of many agonising defeats in recent times, but Cohen&apos;s performance, with a background of signs saying Shalom, Salaam, Peace, was a triumph of the will. Or as Cohen put it:  Ring the bells that still can ring, forget your perfect offering, there is a crack in everything, that&apos;s how the light gets in.  &quot;How many roads must a man walk down, before they can call him a man?&quot; asked his fellow troubadour, so many years ago when they both began to build their tower of song and enter into the consciousness of my generation. For Cohen to be able to reach the point of saying &quot;I&apos;m your man&quot;, he had to overcome the theft of millions of dollars by his former manager, bouts of depression, transformations of identity, a fainting spell in one of his recent performances and a call that he should boycott Israel as a show of solidarity with the Palestinians. Cohen&apos;s response to the call for a cultural boycott was to create a Fund for Reconciliation, Tolerance and Peace and to devote all of the proceeds from the Israeli concert &quot;to organisations and individuals working in Israel and Palestine to advance the recognition and full expression of human rights in the region&quot;. The singer singled out the Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved Parents Circle, who despite the loss of a close loved one work together for peace and reconciliation. Author David Grossman, who lost a son on the last day of the Lebanon war in 2006, thanked Cohen for his support and the singer answered from the stage that &quot;the bereaved parents&apos; response to their suffering transcends the instinct for anger and revenge, and offers hope from the heart, even the hope for peace&quot;. I have always believed that constructive engagement, and not boycott, is the way to promote an end to the occupation and build Israeli-Palestinian peace. Last week I participated in a brainstorming session of the Palestinian-Israel Peace NGO Forum, a network of more than 100 civil society organisations, which discussed the challenge of promoting greater awareness in the media of activity for human rights, against the occupation and for peace. This is never an easy matter when media is immersed in a Darwinian survival of the fittest and continues to function under the traditional slogan, &quot;If it bleeds, it leads (and also sells)&quot;. Cohen&apos;s concert, with the media saturation it achieved, provided the answer. I was not surprised to see Member of Knesset Ilan Gilon (Meretz) at the concert, one of the few MKs who openly declares that he is still a socialist, devoted to both a just society and Israeli-Palestinian peace. However, I also saw MK Tzahi Hanegbi (Kadima) who, as a student at the Hebrew University, used to attack leftwing activists but has now mellowed into an opposition MK who is ready to come to a concert held under the flag of peace and reconciliation. Roger Waters recently narrated a short film called Walled Horizons, produced by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. During the film&apos;s finale, in a segment from his 2006 concert at the joint Jewish-Arab community Neve Shalom-Wahat al-Salam, Waters promised to do a performance of The Wall when the separation wall comes down, just as he did when the Berlin wall came down. Just imagine the potential impact that Waters might have if he were to perform the concert today next to the wall, with Israeli and Palestinian singers and a joint audience. In the words of Cohen&apos;s mesmerising version of the old anti-Nazi Partisan Song, one of the highlights of last night&apos;s concert and an old staple of leftwing hootenannies during the 1950s and 1960s in the US:  Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing, through the graves the wind is blowing, freedom soon will come; then we&apos;ll come from the shadows.

Asculai, a former official with Israel&apos;s Atomic Energy Commission, noted that the newly-exposed plant near Qom was reportedly smaller than Natanz, Iran&apos;s main enrichment plant, and therefore it seemed likely that the only purpose for the second plant was for weapons.

If people are going to talk to Iran there will be more room for Israel&apos;s assessment of the situation.&quot; But this should not be used to justify a possible Israeli military strike, Javedanfar warned. Instead, he hoped this new information would convince Iran to accept wider inspections. &quot;We can use it to our advantage in the negotiations.

It operates in bleak economic conditions, with high unemployment and the extra costs and challenges of dealing with the checkpoints and delays that make up Israel&apos;s military occupation. And, on top of that, they have to market their Palestinian beer to Israeli customers. Yet, the Taybeh brewery brews on, producing thousands of bottles of lager every month. This weekend the village, in the hills of the West Bank just east of Jerusalem, will hold its fifth annual Oktoberfest and expects to attract up to 10,000 visitors \u2013 not just tourists, but also inquisitive Palestinians and Israelis. The Taybeh brewery was born in the years of optimism that followed the Oslo peace accords in the mid-1990s, a time when Palestinians and Israelis hoped an end to their conflict was in sight. Nadim Khoury, now 50, had left the village years before and was living in Boston in the US, where he had taught himself to brew beer at home. His family encouraged him to return to the West Bank. No bank or aid agency would fund a project as unlikely as a Palestinian brewery, so the family put up the $1.2m themselves and in 1994 set up the brewery on their village land. &quot;The banks and NGOs thought we were crazy to build a brewery in a Muslim country,&quot; says Khoury. &quot;But now I think we were lucky we didn&apos;t take their money.&quot; Business virtually ground to a halt in the years of the second intifada \u2013 the Palestinian uprising that began in late 2000. Many of the brewery&apos;s workers were laid off but, since the business had no mortgage or other debts, it survived. &quot;I know so many friends who lost their businesses because the banks took over,&quot; Khoury says. Now that the violence has receded \u2013 in the West Bank at least \u2013 the brewery is fully functioning again. Workers produce three different lagers \u2013 in varying strengths from light to dark \u2013 and this summer launched a new product, Taybeh Halal, a malty, non-alcoholic beer which is being heavily marketed at a young Palestinian demographic. In part, this is an effort to enter a new market, in part it is an insurance policy. &quot;Just in case something happens and there is a change in the environment and political situation,&quot; Khoury says. The brewery dominates the village of Taybeh, which is largely Christian \u2013 Khoury himself is Greek Orthodox. His brother, David, is the mayor. However, the Christian population is in decline. Khoury has seen so many Palestinian Christians leaving for a life abroad that he says there are now more of his fellow villagers living in Michigan than in Taybeh itself. Taybeh beer is surprisingly popular in Japan and is also brewed under licence in Germany. Closer to home, Khoury sells his beer to restaurants in the more liberal Palestinian cities, such as Ramallah and Bethlehem, but many of the deliveries go into Jerusalem and further into Israel, to Tel Aviv, Haifa and Nazareth. That brings its own complications, because of the occupation. Although Taybeh village is only a few minutes drive from Jerusalem, the beer deliveries must go through a checkpoint at Tarqumiya, near Hebron, which is about two hours by road. There, the trucks are rigorously searched and the beer transferred to Israeli trucks in a process that can take several hours and leave the beer exposed to the sunlight. Since they use no preservatives in the brewing process, this unwieldy transit process can be particularly problematic, Khoury says. &quot;My beer is delicate. I cannot afford to have it sit in the sunlight,&quot; he says. Khoury himself has a US passport, but because he also has an Israeli-issued West Bank identity card he must apply for a permit to enter Jerusalem. His permit allows him to enter only through one specified checkpoint, at Qalandiya, and only by foot. He cannot stay the night and must renew the permit every six months. He has faced severe delays importing bottles from Europe through Israel, so much so that he now buys Israeli-made bottles. And he would like to export more Taybeh to the Arab world, but that brings its own complications: the Jordanians impose prohibitively high import duties to protect their own foreign-run beer industry. If there were freer trade in the Arab world, his non-alcoholic beer would have a larger market. Nonetheless, there are signs of an improvement in the West Bank economy this year, albeit from a low base. &quot;Demand has rapidly increased,&quot; says Khoury. &quot;If there is peace and prosperity, people celebrate more.&quot; His daughter, Madees, 24, is now playing a more important role in the brewery and is one day likely to take over from her father. As well as running a successful business, they hope to change attitudes. &quot;People don&apos;t believe that we have a product like Taybeh beer brewed in Palestine,&quot; he says. &quot;On the news they see only violence, bombing and uprisings. Now we are trying to change this and to show the world we can live in peace with our neighbours. We are human beings. We have a right to enjoy life.

One of the main reasons for the astonishment was that so little was known about him. One recently published claim about his background comes from an article in the Daily Telegraph. Entitled &quot;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed to have Jewish past&quot;, it claims that his family converted to Islam after his birth. The claim is based on a number of arguments, a key one being that his previous surname was Sabourjian which &quot;derives from weaver of the sabour, the name for the Jewish tallit shawl in Persia&quot;. Professor David Yeroshalmi, author of The Jews of Iran in the 19th century and an expert on Iranian Jewish communities, disputes the validity of this argument. &quot;There is no such meaning for the word &apos;sabour&apos; in any of the Persian Jewish dialects, nor does it mean Jewish prayer shawl in Persian. Also, the name Sabourjian is not a well-known Jewish name,&quot; he stated in a recent interview. In fact, Iranian Jews use the Hebrew word &quot;tzitzit&quot; to describe the Jewish prayer shawl. Yeroshalmi, a scholar at Tel Aviv University&apos;s Center for Iranian Studies, also went on to dispute the article&apos;s findings that the &quot;-jian&quot; ending to the name specifically showed the family had been practising Jews. &quot;This ending is in no way sufficient to judge whether someone has a Jewish background. Many Muslim surnames have the same ending,&quot; he stated. Upon closer inspection, a completely different interpretation of &quot;Sabourjian&quot; emerges. According to Robert Tait, a Guardian correspondent who travelled to Ahmadinejad&apos;s native village in 2005, the name &quot;derives from thread painter \u2013 sabor in Farsi \u2013 a once common and humble occupation in the carpet industry in Semnan province, where Aradan is situated&quot;. This is confirmed by Kasra Naji, who also wrote a biography of Ahmadinejad and met his family in his native village. Carpet weaving or colouring carpet threads are not professions associated with Jews in Iran. According to both Naji and Tait, Ahmadinejad&apos;s father Ahmad was in fact a religious Shia, who taught the Quran before and after Ahmadinejad&apos;s birth and their move to Tehran. So religious was Ahmad Sabourjian that he bought a house near a Hosseinieh, a religious club that he frequented during the holy month of Moharram to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hossein. Moreover, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s mother is a Seyyede. This is a title given to women whose family are believed to be direct bloodline descendants of Prophet Muhammad. Male members are given the title of Seyyed, and include prominent figures such as Iran&apos;s supreme leader Ali Khamenei. In Judaism, this is equivalent to the Cohens, who are direct descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. One has to be born into a Seyyed family: the title is never given to Muslims by birth, let alone converts. This makes it impossible for Ahmadinejad&apos;s mother to have been a Jew. In fact, she was so proud of her lineage that everyone in her native village of Aradan referred to her by her Islamic title, Seyyede. The reason that Ahmadinejad&apos;s father changed his surname has more to do with the class struggle in Iran. When it became mandatory to adopt surnames, many people from rural areas chose names that represented their professions or that of their ancestors. This made them easily identifiable as townfolk. In many cases they changed their surnames upon moving to Tehran, in order to avoid snobbery and discrimination from residents of the capital. The Sabourjians were one of many such families. Their surname was related to carpet-making, an industry that conjures up images of sweatshops. They changed it to Ahmadinejad in order to help them fit in. The new name was also chosen because it means from the race of Ahmad, one of the names given to Muhammad. According to Ahmadinejad&apos;s relatives the new name emphasised the family&apos;s piety and their dedication to their religion and its founder. This is something that the president and his relatives in Tehran and Aradan have maintained to the present day. Not because they are trying to deny their past, but because they are proud of it.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-05T10:14:00Z", "title": "Ahmadinejad has no Jewish roots | Meir Javedanfar", "sentences": ["Yeroshalmi, a scholar at Tel Aviv University&apos;s Center for Iranian Studies, also went on to dispute the article&apos;s findings that the &quot;-jian&quot; ending to the name specifically showed the family had been practising Jews."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-jewish-family"}, {"tags": ["Conservative conference 2009", "David Cameron", "Conservatives", "Conservative conference", "Politics", "The far right", "UK news", "Poland", "European Union", "Europe"], "article": "In Manchester on Tuesday, some Conservatives will meet Michal Kaminski, leader of David Cameron&apos;s European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European parliament, set up to promote the one policy over which MEPs have no powers \u2013 anti-federalism. They should ask him some sharp questions. This week, I represented the European parliament at a conference in Stockholm of national parliamentarians from all 27 EU member states, meeting to review the Irish &quot;yes&quot; to Lisbon. Speaker after speaker stressed its absolute democratic legitimacy. In the corridors, there was an assumption that Poland&apos;s president will shortly sign. Fredrik Reinfeldt, president-in-office of the EU, whom I met informally later, hopes to see it through on his watch this year. The same MPs heard the chairman of the Czech constitutional court give Lisbon the green light during a meeting in Prague in May. Nothing has happened since then to change this, but he must respond to a filibuster by 17 Eurosceptic senators. ODS chairman Mirek Topol\u00e1nek has warned them that they are forcing the Czech Republic &quot;into isolation&quot;. Even the Eurosceptic Czech President Vaclav Klaus, who is taking time off this week to promote his climate-change-denying book in Albania, is showing signs of change, telling the BBC after the Irish vote, &quot;there will never be another referendum in Europe.&quot; When asked whether he had a message for Britain, he replied: &quot;I am afraid that the people of Britain should have been doing something really much earlier and not just now, too late, saying something and waiting for my decision.&quot; Kaminski himself \u2013 against whom I stood and won re-election as a vice-president in July \u2013 has supported the Lisbon Treaty in public and private. As one commentator who has followed the issue writes, &quot;Kaminski \u2013 wait for it \u2013 likes the Lisbon Treaty. He admires it. He thinks it protects national sovereignty. He wanted Ireland to say yes to it. He is completely at odds with the Tories on it.&quot; Hardly surprising given the praise of his former boss, Polish President Lech Kaczynski, for the original reform treaty since &quot;basically Poland got what it wanted&quot;. Kaminski, whose protectionist, nationalist party is light years from Cameron&apos;s &quot;liberal conservatism&quot;, even supports the ludicrous Common Agricultural Policy. Kaminski has urged &quot;we must be allied with those EU countries that defend the CAP.&quot; David Cameron was misled by Daniel Hannan MEP \u2013 who has, at last, made public his long-held desire for UK independence from Europe \u2013 into swapping partnership with the majority mainstream Christian Democrat/Conservative EPP Group for the extreme, marginal parties on the wilder shores of European politics. Hannan&apos;s political adventure \u2013 whose ultimate motive is probably based on Lenin&apos;s &quot;worst is best&quot; theory \u2013 was rejected in turn by William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. Following a blind manifesto pledge and on the assurance that the party had checked the backgrounds of its new partners, I joined the ECR after the Euro-election. But at its inaugural meeting on 24 June, after a tip-off warned &quot;I hope no MEP in the new group has had links with extremist movements like Poland&apos;s National Revival [NOP \u2013 a neo-Nazi group],&quot; Michal Kaminski tried to cover up his membership (see his Wikipedia editing history for 25 June), later pretending that he was a schoolboy member. But he was caught out by an NOP spokesman, who told the Daily Telegraph that he was an activist from the ages of 17 to 20, his formative political experience. Even now, he is pictured on the homepage of the NOP website, which comments that no good comes to those who try to dissemble about their past. When reaching out to the British gay community, Conservatives should not forget that &quot;Michal Kaminski has become a symbol of homophobia in Poland. As an MEP, he constantly voted against resolutions that fight homophobia in Europe.&quot; Gay rights groups in Poland are damning in their appraisal. The only BBC interview with Kaminski, in which he denies ever using homophobic language, carries a clip from Polish TV where he uses the term &quot;pedaly&quot;, literally &quot;pedals&quot; but connoting pederasty \u2013 &quot;boy-bangers&quot; comes close. Even the interviewer says it is offensive, but he repeats it. Kaminski now parades his pro-Israel stance, appearing in Manchester as a guest of Conservative Friends of Israel. But in 2001, he campaigned against an apology for the Jedwabne pogrom in July 1941, when hundreds of Jews were rounded up by their neighbours and burnt in a barn, a massacre so notorious that a play, &apos;Our Class&apos;, based on it opened in London recently. As noted by former director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research Antony Lerman, the reports about Kaminski have been shown to be true; and he observes that being &quot;pro-Israeli&quot; does not necessarily mean that someone is incapable of holding antisemitic views. Journalists continue to unearth his past, highlighting Kaminski&apos;s attempts to twist and turn. An interview with the Polish paper Nasza Polska shows that Kaminski had said that Poland should apologise only if &quot;someone from the Jewish side will apologise for what the Jews did during the Soviet occupation between 1939 and 1941&quot;. There were three million Jews in Poland before the Holocaust. Some of the few survivors later worked with the victorious Soviets to identify the Nazis&apos; Polish collaborators: wouldn&apos;t you? Leading Polish daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza politely skewers Kaminski with the recent comment that he &quot;is not officially and completely an antisemite or homophobic, but at some point he recognised that these things can help him politically&quot;. His repellent party, according to Tel Aviv University&apos;s Stephen Roth Institute, contains radical nationalists and ex-members of antisemitic organisations. It is allied with Radio Maryja, a nationalist Catholic radio station and a key force on the far right, which gives airtime to antisemitic ranters. But according to Hannan, one reason the Tory MEPs left the EPP Group was because David Cameron felt &quot;it is wrong for Conservatives to say one thing in Britain and do another in Brussels&quot;. Yet this is exactly what is happening now with these antisemitic, homophobic, racist links. All this is hardly helpful to Cameron&apos;s positioning on issues like the Lisbon treaty. Now anti-EU organisations such as the Bruges Group are seeking to create an open civil war. Cameron has to hold the line. Eurosceptic media and anti-EU campaign organisations call for a referendum willy-nilly. Open Europe urges a separate back-stop referendum \u2013 on reform of the EU. But in the rest of Europe, any form of referendum is seen as the United Kingdom heading towards the exit. I am writing this in the Jean Monnet House outside Paris, where the European parliament&apos;s bureau is holding an away-day to plan how to work with national parliaments, which, under the treaty, get a direct and decisive say in EU law-making. But I am not a Euro-fanatic; I am a Conservative internationalist, who wants Britain to lead in Europe \u2013 not leave it. As prime minister, David Cameron will see the necessity of having friends and allies across the EU. France&apos;s Europe minister Pierre Lellouche is right to say that by leaving the centre-right EPP group, the Tories have &quot;marginalised themselves&quot;. Germany&apos;s Christian Democrat CDU party has also downgraded relations with the Conservatives. The ECR group has diminished his otherwise able and hard-working MEPs&apos; ability to deliver Cameron&apos;s agenda on EU reform, climate change and open markets: its 60-odd members would have given real added value to the 265 in the EPP and helped shape their policies. That will matter even more as MEPs will gain new powers if Lisbon comes into force \u2013 but these, to repeat, do not include any constitutional aspects such as &quot;anti-federalism&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T13:30:54Z", "title": "Conservatives head for cul-de-sac with Kaminski | Edward McMillan-Scott", "sentences": ["His repellent party, according to Tel Aviv University&apos;s Stephen Roth Institute, contains radical nationalists and ex-members of antisemitic organisations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/06/davidcameron-conservatives"}, {"tags": ["Germany", "Second world war", "Holocaust", "Israel", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "The German town of Dachau has become the first location of a former Nazi concentration camp to establish a partnership with an Israeli town in a controversial &quot;peace and understanding&quot; agreement. Twenty-two other German towns are twinned with Israeli towns, but until now the list has not included a former concentration camp settlement. Peter B\u00fcrgel, the mayor of Dachau, near Munich, spent two years searching for a town in Israel prepared to become its twin. Dachau, where the Nazis built their first concentration camp in 1933, in which 43,000 mainly Jewish prisoners were murdered, is synonymous with the Holocaust in Israel. Scores of towns rejected B\u00fcrgel&apos;s overtures, calling the idea unacceptable, until Moshe Sinai, mayor of Rosh Haayn, a town about 12 miles east of Tel Aviv, agreed to take up his invitation. The first exchanges between students and other young people are due to start next year. The decision has been greeted with consternation by many Israelis. &quot;Obviously the people in Rosh Haayn know nothing about the Holocaust,&quot; said Moshe Sanbar, 84, a Dachau survivor and former director of the Bank of Israel. &quot;Our people were worked to death there. Why can&apos;t they now let us die in peace?&quot; Sinai, whose parents were eastern European Jews who escaped to Israel, but who lost many members of his family in the Holocaust, visited Dachau earlier this year. &quot;I was convinced that the Germans&apos; intentions were good and that their horror over the monstrosities that took place were genuine. We cannot reject this outstretched hand,&quot; he said. Unlike Sinai, most of the 40,000 inhabitants of Rosh Haayn are of Yemeni origin, and fled growing persecution and discrimination in their homeland in 1946, settling in Israel. As a result the Holocaust is not part of their personal history. B\u00fcrgel said: &quot;Dachau is a synonym for the crimes of National Socialism. We want to become a town of peace and a place of learning and remembrance for the young people of the world.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2009.

Its vibrant cosmopolitan flavour, its commercial centre, its Mediterranean beaches, its liberal society and culture, are seen as signifying a truly commendable Zionist enterprise. According to the blurb on the centenary celebrations &quot;several dozen families gathered on the sand dunes on the beach outside Yafo to allocate plots of land for a new neighbourhood they called Ahuzat Bayit, later known as Tel Aviv&quot;. After the horrors of the Gaza onslaught and unending blockade, and the evidence of war crimes committed by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) early this year (which Israel has responded to with hysterical denial) no effort has been spared by the Israeli embassy and its propaganda machines to deflect the attention of the world to Israel&apos;s marvellous technical and medical discoveries, and to use Tel Aviv to present its upbeat image. Hence Tel Aviv festivities were organised in New York, Vienna, Copenhagen and Paris, with the creation of Tel Aviv beaches in Central Park and along the banks of the Seine, the Danube and Copenhagen&apos;s canals. In London this week, the Israeli embassy teams up with easyJet to promote its new flights to Tel Aviv with a series of events around London to provide &quot;a sweet taste of Israel&apos;s 24-hour city&quot; as a &quot;celebration of Israeli culture, which includes the valuable contribution from many minorities in Israel, such as Christians, Muslims and Druze&quot;. While there is much on the surface that makes Tel Aviv enticing, this picture must be not be allowed to mask the dark underlying history of ethnic cleansing and land expropriation on which Tel Aviv was built, and that still continues today, even in Jaffa, while savouring the Israeli food and the Bauhaus architecture. In fact, the whole myth of Tel Aviv being built on empty sand dunes has been taken apart by various Israeli scholars, but none of this will feature in the promotional events. As Yonathan Mendel says in his article &quot;Fantasising Israel&quot; in the London Review of books:  It [Tel Aviv] didn&apos;t just emerge from the sand in 1909, as the Zionist myth tells us. Al-Sumayil, Salame, Sheikh Munis, Abu Kabir, Al-Manshiyeh: these are the names of some of the villages that made room for it and the names are still used today. Tel Avivians still talk about the Abu Kabir neighbourhood, they still meet on Salame Street. Tel Aviv University Faculty Club used to be the house of the sheikh of Sheikh Munis.  The Israeli organisation Zochrot has published maps of Tel Aviv showing where Arab localities existed, particularly in Jaffa and its suburbs to the south, and in smaller villages east and north of the city, but which have been erased from maps of the region and its posted signs. Initially Tel Aviv in its infancy was an adjunct of Jaffa, which Mendel says:  was probably the most prosperous and cosmopolitan of all Palestinian cities, with a port, an industry (Jaffa oranges), an international school system and a lively cultural life. In 1949, after Jaffa had been almost completely emptied of its Palestinian inhabitants (only 4,000 were left out of a population of 70,000), the Israeli government decided to unite the two cities in one metropolis, to be called &apos;Tel Aviv-Jaffa&apos;. In doing this, Ben-Gurion not only created a new Tel Aviv that was &apos;part of&apos; biblical Jaffa, he erased the Palestinian city.  The city was subject to intensive shelling in 1948, when more than 60,000 of its residents were forced to leave \u2013 mostly fleeing to Gaza. Seventy-five per cent of the city was bulldozed, leaving only 4,000 Palestinians in the now run-down Ajame and Jabaliah neighbourhoods, which in fact today are the subject of intended clearance by the Amidar corporation, who have imposed fines on the residents for &quot;illegally&quot; improving their houses when they had refused to allow them to upgrade What will be built in their place is luxurious real estate at fantastic prices beyond the reach of the existing inhabitants. Jaffa today has been turned into a picturesque artists&apos; colony, in the houses expropriated from their Palestinian owners. Distant from the portrayal of Tel Aviv as a beautiful cultural city is its significance as the centre for the Israeli military and military research in an area called HaKirya, where the IDF has had its headquarters since it was founded in 1948. In addition to occupying large areas in the heart of Tel Aviv it accommodates the Israeli military deep underground, where the pre-planning and the daily orders for the assaults on Gaza were made. This supposed &quot;mixed city&quot; of Tel-Aviv/Yafo (even the name Jaffa is not used) has only 4.2% Palestinian residents, compared with the 20% of Israel&apos;s wider population \u2013 hardly an indication of the city&apos;s vaunted &quot;diversity&quot;. In fact, as the author and architect Sharon Rotbard has pointed out, Jaffa existed before 1909 as mainly Arab, but in fact a mixed city, with many Palestinian Jews in suburbs established in 1887 and 1905. The new Tel Aviv was established by white European Jews, and thus, as Gabriel Ash says the centennial &quot;is legitimising colonialism through the commemoration of the arrival of white Europeans to the orient&quot;. The American historian VG Smith comments on Tel Aviv&apos;s Bauhaus architecture:  The myth of Tel Aviv as &apos;the White City&apos; rests on the importation of style characteristics from European Modernism into Israel ... and can be understood as a vocabulary of forms or as a social movement to achieve a better life through architecture. To mimic International Style characteristics is as false as the nation&apos;s imitation of a modern state.

That it&apos;s possible to write this barely nine months into the Obama presidency, which seemed to promise the distinct possibility of a breakthrough in resolving the conflict, is not simply a reflection of disappointment \u2013 possibly premature \u2013 that the administration has achieved so little, but a realistic acknowledgement of a palpable deterioration on a number of fronts. Binyamin Netanyahu is successfully resisting a freeze on settlements. Mahmoud Abbas flip-flopped over referral of the Goldstone report to the UN security council and damaged his credibility. Hamas is more in control of Gaza than ever. The Israeli authorities have been harassing dissenters and preventing Israeli human rights organisations from operating in Gaza. In such a climate, where political and diplomatic means of conflict resolution appear to be going nowhere, where do you turn for inspiration to find new ways forward, better tools for analysing what&apos;s gone wrong? One answer may lie in the issues being discussed at a conference taking place at Birkbeck, University of London, today and tomorrow, titled &quot;Sites of Conflict: Psycho-political Resistance in Israel-Palestine&quot;. Organised by Professor Lynne Segal, the conference was prompted by the work of a group called Psychoactive \u2013 Mental Health Professionals for Human Rights, which includes both Israeli Jews and Palestinians who are trying to deal with the psychological consequences of the conflict for occupied and occupier by offering their professional tools &quot;for engaging with oppression and violence \u2013 whether this is in the clinic or the public space&quot;. Members of Psychoactive and other groups working in nonviolent ways to resist occupation and military conflict are discussing the use of psycho-social methods to understand the motivations of protagonists and victims of violence and how resistance can be made more effective. At the opening public session last night, Professor Uri Hadar of Tel Aviv University, an Israeli psychologist, sought to explain &quot;Israeli brutality towards Palestinians and what enables it&quot;. Professor Stephen Frosh, Pro-Vice-Master of Birkbeck, thought that some of the questions Jews are asking themselves are: &quot;What have we done? What have we become?&quot; Any discussion of the Israel-Palestine conflict which tries to take a psychological or psychoanalytical approach is bound to enter very difficult mental territory and also to attract some scepticism from those who see the problems as essentially political and requiring political solutions. Take the question of how memory of the Holocaust has influenced Israeli behaviour towards the Palestinians. The notion that the Holocaust is seen by Israel as sanctifying its creation is widely accepted. But the argument that Israel has never been properly able to mourn the mass murder of six million Jews, thus never properly assimilating it into the Israeli psyche, and that this has led to &quot;full-blown Palestinian Holocaust being part of an unconscious Israeli itinerary&quot; (in the words of Uri Hadar) is troublingly controversial. Stephen Frosh acknowledged that such a thought could be seen as flowing from the words of Primo Levi, perhaps the most respected moral voice and witness of the Holocaust, who said after the massacre at Sabra and Shatila in 1982: &quot;Everybody is somebody&apos;s Jew. And today the Palestinians are the Jews of the Israelis&quot;. But Professor Frosh questioned the deterministic conclusion Uri Hadar drew from his understanding of how the Holocaust has influenced Israeli behaviour. Even if such a conclusion were seen as valid, would it have any practical political ramifications? This is a question that a conference seeking to find new resources for combined resistance and shared hope must surely confront. When someone at the opening session said that because Israel had turned its back on the idea that there are &quot;Jewish alternatives to its behaviour&quot;, he could not see Israel surviving as an institution, this seemed to me to completely ignore the fact that Israel&apos;s power, however much it has lost its decisive quality in circumstances of asymmetrical warfare, makes such an outcome not only extremely remote, but entertaining it is of no help whatsoever to the Palestinians. If the comments of Palestinians at the session are anything to go by, while understanding Israeli behaviour is important, the conference will need to address the issue of power and powerlessness. Both on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank, and on the international stage, many Palestinians will see the exercise of Israeli power as going unchecked. But what one nation state can do, surely another nation state, the United States, can use its vastly superior power to undo. Obama at least engendered hope, and as one Palestinian from Gaza said, a key goal must be overcoming the terrible feelings of hopelessness that prevail there. He was looking to the conference to help move Israelis, Jews and the European community &quot;to do something for the Palestinian people&quot;. However far the conference is physically from the theatre of conflict, in the current climate the opportunity to discuss such issues as the mental attrition of activists, the politics of apology, acknowledgement and denial, the role of the Jewish and Palestinian diasporas in supporting resistance is not something to be taken lightly. Judge Richard Goldstone&apos;s UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza invasion has been virtually buried by the efforts of Israel, the US and the European Union, and his report described as a 21st century Protocols of the Elders of Zion by Anne Bayefsky speaking at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel has been barred from sending medical teams into Gaza. Israeli human rights groups will no longer receive answers to representations they make to the Israeli authorities on behalf of Palestinians who need to enter or exit Gaza for humanitarian or educational reasons. All of these developments have a silencing effect: they bring action to an end, restrict the space for reasoned dialogue; demonise dissent and leave the Palestinians who are suffering in Gaza and living under Israeli control even more voiceless. By creating a site for sharing deeper understandings of the conflict, the Birkbeck conference is a strike against silence.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-15T09:00:00Z", "title": "A strike against silence | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["At the opening public session last night, Professor Uri Hadar of Tel Aviv University, an Israeli psychologist, sought to explain &quot;Israeli brutality towards Palestinians and what enables it&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/15/israel-palestine-psychoactive-conference"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more than 100 years old. Israel is, no doubt, not doing what it should to end the occupation of the territories conquered in 1967. Along with many others in Israel I am committed to ending it. But there are many Palestinians and others who endorse their just cause who take every opportunity to return to what happened in 1948 \u2013 which is not constructive. Abe Hayeem&apos;s recent article is typical of this tendency, in that he seamlessly moves from Operation Cast Lead (which was conducted in an indefensible manner \u2013 even though Hayeem might have mentioned the years of shelling of southern Israel by Qassams for minimal balance) to Tel Aviv&apos;s Centennial Festivities by pointing out that the history of Tel Aviv is part of the expropriation of 1948. In doing so, they time and again raise the question whether Israel&apos;s existence is legitimate. Instead of working towards the realisation of the two-state solution, they keep the option in public discourse that Israel will disappear from the map. There is one main reason why the Israeli right is currently in power, and the left has disappeared. Most Jewish Israelis want the occupation to end and agree to a Palestinian state, but they are not willing to move ahead as long as they have reason to think that a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders is only meant as a step on the way to erasing Israel altogether. Unfortunately, this suspicion is not sheer paranoia: Hamas to this day is committed explicitly to Israel&apos;s annihilation, and many others who are less violent in their means, continue to think that Israel should be replaced by a binational state west of the Jordan River. I understand the pain of Palestinians whose families were expelled in 1948, and how they must feel when they see a flourishing institution like Tel Aviv University with its 25,000 students, at which I teach, that is built on the site of a former Palestinian village, Sheikh Munis. And of course Israel is making the process of mourning the Palestinian people need to undergo almost impossible by continuing to occupy the West-Bank and keeping a stranglehold on Gaza. I understand the Palestinians in the same way that I understand the pain of millions of who were displaced during the partition of India and Pakistan; of 12 million Germans who were expelled from homes their families inhabited, sometimes for centuries, in Poland, Czechoslovakia and other areas after 1945; or the pain of Native Americans who lost their magnificent prairies to white conquest. Nowhere, and no time, can history achieve total justice. Native Americans, Indians, Pakistanis, Germans and the many, many others who were expelled from their native lands in the last two centuries \u2013 often, like the Palestinians, after 1945 -- will never regain their lands. The question is how to make the best of the present. I think the first step is to get history right. Palestinians were not just passive victims in what they call the Nakba, as if it had been something like a natural catastrophe. Far from being only victims, they made decisions like choosing to follow Muhammad Amin al-Husseini who formed close ties with Nazi Germany. Arab rejection of the Jewish presence created a zero-sum-game that made the attempts of Jewish leaders like Magnes and Buber to seek cooperation and coexistence with Palestinian Arabs irrelevant. It is important to remember that Palestinians made choices (and it is often conveniently repressed by them and their proponents). They could have accepted the UN partition plan of 1947. They chose not to. Let us not delude ourselves: if the Arab armies that attacked the fledgling state of Israel had won, not a single Jew would have been allowed to stay in Palestine, and countless would have been killed. Israel won the 1948 war, and, as is well documented now, used the chaos of war to expel 750,000 Palestinians from Israel. This is a tragedy for the Palestinians, but they are not the only ones who pay a heavy price for losing wars. Continuing to harp on the themes of colonialism and apartheid doesn&apos;t serve any purpose except the ventilation of rage \u2013 a rage that raises questions when it comes to the self-appointed defenders of Palestinians. Let me make clear: Abe Hayeem&apos;s Jewishness does not play a role for me. We are all entitled to choose our political agendas. I am talking about all those whose visceral hatred of Israel is particularly strange, because they don&apos;t move a finger to help many other oppressed people whose suffering is horrible. I would like to ask them for some introspection: why do they have such trouble with Tel Aviv&apos;s cultural and economic flourishing, but not with that of other cities from Beijing to Moscow whose history is fraught with past and current human rights violations that eclipse those of Israel immeasurably? Why do they speak of every Palestinian killed by Israel (and each of them is a tragedy), but choose to forget, conveniently, that the state of Jordan killed more Palestinians in one month than Israel throughout its history? What psychological need is served by their presenting Israel as the pinnacle of evil, and why can they not accept that Israel is a lively, even though flawed, democracy that succeeds in thriving under existential threat? Whether Abe Hayeem likes it or not, Tel Aviv&apos;s flourishing is a remarkable achievement; I am proud of it, participate in the effort to develop it further and celebrate its liberalism, openness, cultural creativity and joie de vivre \u2013 while continuing to oppose the occupation. And no: Israelis are by and large neither colonisers nor bloodthirsty \u2013 least of all in Tel Aviv which is largely left-leaning. They just want to live rich and fulfilled lives, and there is nothing they want more than to live in peace with prospering neighbors. Instead of fanning rage, the self-righteous who love to hate Israel should join those who, like Salam Fayyad, do their best to move Palestine ahead, so it can flourish, too.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-15T11:00:01Z", "title": "Why I celebrate the Tel Aviv centenary | Carlo Strenger", "sentences": ["Abe Hayeem&apos;s recent article is typical of this tendency, in that he seamlessly moves from Operation Cast Lead (which was conducted in an indefensible manner \u2013 even though Hayeem might have mentioned the years of shelling of southern Israel by Qassams for minimal balance) to Tel Aviv&apos;s Centennial Festivities by pointing out that the history of Tel Aviv is part of the expropriation of 1948.", "I understand the pain of Palestinians whose families were expelled in 1948, and how they must feel when they see a flourishing institution like Tel Aviv University with its 25,000 students, at which I teach, that is built on the site of a former Palestinian village, Sheikh Munis.", "I would like to ask them for some introspection: why do they have such trouble with Tel Aviv&apos;s cultural and economic flourishing, but not with that of other cities from Beijing to Moscow whose history is fraught with past and current human rights violations that eclipse those of Israel immeasurably?", "Whether Abe Hayeem likes it or not, Tel Aviv&apos;s flourishing is a remarkable achievement; I am proud of it, participate in the effort to develop it further and celebrate its liberalism, openness, cultural creativity and joie de vivre \u2013 while continuing to oppose the occupation.", "And no: Israelis are by and large neither colonisers nor bloodthirsty \u2013 least of all in Tel Aviv which is largely left-leaning."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/15/israel-palestinian-territories"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "CSKA Moscow", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2009-10"], "article": " A word about tonight&apos;s hosts: The 2005 Uefa Cup winners go into tonight&apos;s match lying fourth in the Russian top flight, seven points off the pace set by league leaders Rubin Kazan - who are better than Barcelona - with just five games of the season to go.

He concudes it by saying &quot;Well done,&quot; to his inquisitor Geoff Shreeves, in that patronising way of his, presumably because Geoff lobbed the kind of interrogatory softballs that don&apos;t displease knights of the realm.  During the course of their chat, Fergie told Geoff that he&apos;s kept his players on British Summer Time in a bid to avoid them becoming jet-lagged as they go about their preparations for Sunday&apos;s Premier League match against Liverpool. It&apos;s an interesting team he&apos;s picked tonight, but not a hugely surprising one. Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney, Patrick Evra, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs have all been left at home, which is proof, if proof was needed, that Ferguson is prioritising Sunday&apos;s match over a game that isn&apos;t so much must-win as this doesn&apos;t-really-matter-if-we-don&apos;t-win.  This just in, from my colleague Tom Bryant: &quot;Peter Schmeichel has launched a &apos;collection of jewellery, cufflinks, bracelets and necklets, specially designed for Manchester United fans&apos; in collaboration with jewellery designers Dyrberg/Kern,&quot; he writes. &quot;Very tasteful it is too.&quot;  Pre-match niceties: Click-clack, click-clack, click-clack, click-clack. Holding the hands of their allotted players, both sets of mascots march out on to the artificial grass of the Luzhniki Stadium and the Champions League music blares out over the tannoy. According to the commentators, it&apos;s not much colder in Moscow tonight than it was in Wigan last Sunday, which means it&apos;s probably around -30 degrees centigrade.  1 min: Manchester United line up playing in black shirts, white shorts and white socks, while their hosts are in their usual home strip of red shirts, blue shorts and blue socks. Nani and Valencia look set to patrol the touchlines in a bid to try and put the hurt on the CSKA full-backs, Aleskei Berezutski (twin brother of centre-half Vasili) and Chidi Odiah.  3 min: Not much to report so far. CSKA have lined up in a 4-4-1-1 formation, with Alan Dzagoev playing in the hole behind Tomas Necid.  4 min: A blunder from Nemanja Vidic gifts possession to CSKA on the edge of the Manchester United penalty area and the ball is pinged backwards to right midfielder, Milos Krasic. He surges forward, beats two men and blasts the ball high over the bar.  6 min: What with the Berezutski brothers and Fabio Da Silvo all playing tonight, I wonder if this is the first time three twins have lined up at the start of a Champions League match? Answers on a postcard, please.  7 min: Corner for CSKA. Nothing comes from it and Fabio hacks clear.  8 min: United attack, with John O&apos;Shea and Gary Neville galloping down the right wing. Neville&apos;s cross is so wayward it gives me a chance to thank all of you who have written in to point out that Michael Carrick has not been left at home, he&apos;s on the bench.  11 min: Manchester United are doing well here without looking particularly threatening. They&apos;re keeping the ball on the deck, holding possession well and after a sustained bout of keep-ball they win a free-kick about 40 yards from the CSKA goal, which Anderson sends over the bar.  14 min: Anderson pings a long ball forward from deep, for Fabio to chase. The ball bounces on the artificial surface and practically stops dead, allowing the young Brazilian to square it from the left, but his team-mates are all conspicuous by their absence from the penalty area.  15 min: &quot;Woud fake plastic trees grow on the Luzhniki pitch,&quot; asks Damien Neva. &quot;I suppose only Thom Yorke could answer that.&quot; On the subject of things fake and plastic, Ben Carrdus has this to say: &quot;For those of us nowhere near a telly right now, the worm&apos;s eye view of the pitch with which you have illustrated your report is informative. But what would a worm be doing on artificial turf?&quot;  18 min: There are no shortage of empty seats in the Luzhniki Stadium, but those fans that have turned up are making plenty of noise. There are about 800 Manchester United fans sitting in the Gods high above the CSKA goal, among them sits a group of &quot;Moscow Reds&quot;, whose flag is illustrated with a portrait of Eric Cantona.  20 min: Plenty of huff, puff and endeavour from both sides, but not much being created in the way of goalscoring opportunities. Krasic&apos;s shot in the fourth minute was the only effort to give the scoreboard operator anything to think about so far, but that was well wide.  23 min: Nani goes down under a challenge from Sergei Ignashevich, wide on the right about 30 yards out. From the ensuing free-kick, Anderson whips the ball past the wall and sees it bounce in front of the goalkeeper, Igor Akinfeev, who clutches it to his chest.  24 min: Paul Scholes tries a shot from distance that bounces in front of Akinfeev. The goalkeeper makes a meal out of what should have been a fairly straightforward save, clawing the ball over the bar - I have no idea whether that was down to the unpredictable bounce of the ball on an artificial pitch, goalkeeper ineptitude or a mixture of both.  28 min: In the Manchester United penalty area, CSKA striker Tomas Necid gets his head to an Aleskei Berezutski cross from the left, but his flick-on heads straight into the giant paws of Edwin van der Sar in the Manchester United goal.  30 min: Fabio is pumping long balls up in the general direction of Dimitar Berbatov, who&apos;s looking quite isolated up front. Neither Anderson nor Valencia are getting up in support of the Bulgarian, which means the CSKA defence are having an easy time of it.  32 min: &quot;There&apos;s definitely something not right about playing on artificial turf,&quot; writes David Wall.\u00a0&quot;Any surface on which John O&apos;Shea is able to back-heel-nutmeg someone doesn&apos;t mimic grass in any realistic way.&quot; A John O&apos;Shea back-heel nutmeg? I must have missed that.  33 min: Fabio is left trailing in the wake of Milos Krasic, as the blond haired Serbian, who looks a bit like Hans Gruber&apos;s henchman in Die Hard, skins him down the right-hand side and shoots diagonally across the face of goal. Was it a shot or a cross? It&apos;s difficult to tell. But Edwin van der Sar had his angles covered and let the ball go wide safe in the knowledge that Alan Dzagoev wouldn&apos;t make up the necessary ground to poke it in at the far post.  37 min: Under pressure from Aleskei Berezutski, Nani squares the ball across the edge of the penalty area, where Anderson, standing with his back to goal, tees it up for the incoming Gary Neville. He tries a shot from distance that fizzes wide, but not by as much as you&apos;d expect from a man who hasn&apos;t scored a goal for five years.  39 min: A very, very sloppy backpass from Nemanja Vidic almost lets Alan Dzagoev in, but Van Der Sar is alert enough to spare his Serbian colleague&apos;s blushes.  41 min: More pressure from CSKA, who win a free-kick wide on the right, about 35 yards from goal. Krasic whips the ball across the penalty area and Elvir Rahimic goes close at the near post. A corner for CSKA, from which nothing comes.  42 min: Re: footballing brothers: &quot;I&apos;m not sure about twins in the Champions League (6 mins), but if Jonny Evans&apos; younger brother Corry makes the grade, it&apos;s entirely possible that United&apos;s future back four could be comprised of two sets of brothers,&quot; writes Tim Bailey. &quot;The Evans boys in the centre and the cuddly Da Silva twins bombing down the flanks. Surely that&apos;d be some sort of record, with the added bonus of being like a Roy of the Rovers storyline.&quot;  44 min: Antonio Valencia attacks down the right and crosses the ball to Berbatov, standing with his back to goal inside the penalty area. The Bulgarian had managed to roll his marker, but swiped at fresh air as he tried to swivel and steer the ball goalwards.  Half-time: The sides return to the dressing room for their half-time cup of tea and HobNobs with the deadlock firmly intact. I&apos;ve seen worse 0-0ers, but not much worse. On the whole this has been fairly scrappy fare.  Half-time analysis (apologies, but I have to call it something): &quot;That&apos;s not a plastic pitch,&quot; harrumphs Ian Copestake, in Crocodile Dundee mode. &quot;This is a plastic pitch.&quot; &quot;Does Milos Krasic look a bit like Hans Gruber&apos;s henchman in Die Hard who nearly gets strangled by metal chains, or his twin brother-and-fellow-henchman who gets bumped off early in the film?&quot; asks Ian Kay. The former, Ian, unless they&apos;re identical twins in which case he looks like both of them. I&apos;ve always fancied working as a henchman - all of the mindless violence with none of the responsibility for planning heists or terrorist attacks. Does anyone have any advice on the best way to make it in the industry? The high turnover of henchmen in Hollywood action movies would suggest its far from a closed shop. &quot;Do footballers in England really drink tea and eat cookies (biscuits) at half-time or is that just a\u00a0colloquialism\u00a0left over from quainter times when doing something like scoring an own goal would make you blush, as in &apos;sparing ones blushes&apos;. Uninformed yanks want to know,&quot; asks Josh Davis.  Second-half: No changes on either side at half-time and in his interview before heading back out to the second half, Sir Alex Ferguson said he&apos;s reasonably happy with the way his team has played thus far.  46 min: &quot;I just have a quick question,&quot; says Joe Buckner. &quot;Is CSKA pronouced as an\u00a0acronym\u00a0or as siska? I&apos;ve never heard the latter until watching Fox Soccer Channel and its annoying he hell out of me.&quot; I don&apos;t actually know, Joe. I&apos;ve never heard anyone pronounce it as anything other than an acronym and considering how wrong the Fox network is about pretty much everything else, I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and guess they&apos;re incorrect in their pronounciation of CSKA too.  49 min: Nani gallops down the right, cuts inside Aleskei Berezutski and squares the ball across the edge of the six-yard box. Once again, there are no Manchester United players there to capitalise.  50 min: For CSKA, Dzagoev shoots from distance, but doesn&apos;t get enough power behind his effort to trouble Edwin van der Sar.  51 min: This match is so fascinating that I&apos;ve just checked Wikipedia to see if there&apos;s any particular reason that CSKA striker Tomas Necid wears No89. The only clue I can find is that he was born in 1989, but that seems a bit lame. Coincidentally, he also shares a birthday with my father: 13 August.  54 min: Things you missed while I was poncing about on Wikipedia: (1) Dimitar Berbatov getting booked for simulation after swallow-diving over a challenge from one of the Berezutski twins in the CSKA penalty area, (2) Alan Dzagoev getting the ball in the Manchester United goal, but having his effort ruled out, correctly, for offside.  56 min: Manchester United substitution: Rio Ferdinand off, Wes Brown on. There&apos;s nothing wrong with Ferdinand, Ferguson just wants to give Liverpool a sporting chance next Sunday by keeping him fit.  57 min: &quot;One of the few things I&apos;ve picked up on my trips to Moscow is that CSKA is generally known as Cess-ka,&quot; writes Simon Thomas. &quot;I&apos;ve been saving this nugget of information for years, waiting for that very question.&quot; Thanks for that Simon and don&apos;t be too hard on yourself. A friend of mine has made several trips to Moscow over the years and the only things he&apos;s picked up are hookers.  60 min: In the CSKA goal, Igor Akinfeev saves brilliantly from a Nani header. The Portuguese got on the end of a Gary Neville cross from the right and came close to breaking the deadlock despite Sergei Ignashevich having a good hold on his shirt.  63 min: Tomas Necid goes down under a challenge from Fabio and wins a free-kick about 35 yards from goal, wide on the right. Sergei Ignashevich&apos;s shot took a deflection off the Scholes in the wall, which had Edwin van der Sar beaten, only to bounce this wide of the far post.  65 min: Manchester United win a corner, which Anderson pulls back to Paul Scholes outside the CSKA penalty area. He dinks a little through ball into the area for Gary Neville to run on to, but the full-back&apos;s attempted cross was blocked.  67 min: Another through-ball into the CSKA penalty area, this time for Anderson to chase. Igor Akinfeev wins the race to the ball, but not by much. Apologies for harping on about the plastic pitch, but it&apos;s noticable on this surface that the ball doesn&apos;t run on as far as it would on short grass, which means it&apos;s always worth chasing as it could well stop dead before rolling over the goal-line.  69 min: A free-kick that might as well be a corner for Manchester United, who have been completely dominant in this half. Anderson tries to whip it into the far corner of the goal, but Akinfeev punches clear when he probably should have caught it.  70 min: Manchester United substitution: Paul Scholes off, Michael Owen on.  72 min: &quot;Your dad has the misfortune of also sharing his birthday with that epitome of charisma and entirely accidental elbowing, Alan Shearer and (sotto voce) Fergal Sharkey,&quot; writes Chris Ballard, who adds: &quot;I said the second name in a bit of an undertone.&quot;  74 min: CSKA attack on the break, courtesy of the Hans Gruber henchman that was nearly strangled by the chains in Die Hard, as opposed to his dead twin brother. By the time I&apos;ve finished that laboured explanation, Manchester United have recovered and all is well.  76 min: &quot;The pronunciation of CSKA, to close the matter off, is indeed saying the initials, but in Russian,&quot; writes Gadi Abraham. &quot;Tzeh Ess Kah Ah or &apos;Tseska-a (the two ahs join when speaking rapidly). We in Israel know this because of the Macabbi Tel Aviv - CSKA rivalry in basketball. It helps to have around a million of Jewish Russians as well.&quot;  78 min: An error from Fabio, who loses possession out in the far corner, allows CSKA to square the ball to Dzagoev on the edge of the Manchester United penalty area. He prods the ball through to Milos Krasic, who is penalised for offside.  80 min: From the right-hand side of the CSKA penalty area, Anderson crosses for Michael Owen on the edge of the six-yard box. His delivery is about two feet too high for the diminutive striker.  82 min: Valencia rattles - and I mean really  rattles - the CSKA crossbar with a 25-yard drive. Close, but no cigar.  82 min: Nani is such a frustrating footballer. He skins Chidi Odiah down the left wing, cuts inside and then, with team-mates queuing up to get on the end of his cross, plays the ball into the one part of the penalty area that&apos;s unmanned by players from either team.  85 min: Five minutes plus injury-time to go and I&apos;ll be surprised if there isn&apos;t a goal ...  GOAL! CSKA Moscow 0-1 Manchester United (Valencia 85) ... and there it is. A cross comes in from the left, Dimitar Berbatov leaps in the penalty area and nods the ball down to Antonio Valencia, on the right-hand side of the six-yard box. With only Akineev to beat, he controls the ball and drives a diagonal shot into the bottom left-hand corner.  88 min: That&apos;s been a long time coming; so long in fact that I was in the process of writing &quot;I&apos;ll be surprised if there isn&apos;t a goal ... because Manchester United are piling on the pressure and CSKA are looking dangerous on the break&quot;  when it went in.  89 min:  CSKA substitution: Daniel Carvalho on, Chidi Odiah off. Manchester United substitution: Fabio off, Michael Carrick on.  90 min: &quot;It&apos;s quite remarkable that the pronunciation of CSKA was still debated at the 76-minute mark of this game, when the club have existed for 98 years and there have hardly been any debates on the issue as lengthy as this.,&quot; writes Sazali Abdul Aziz, refusing to acknowledge Gadi Abraham&apos;s determination to close the subject.  90+1 min: As Manchester United continue to pile the hurt on CSKA, Mark Grindrod ties up another loose end. &quot;Yes, 89 is Tomas Necid&apos;s shirt number because it&apos;s his birth year,&quot; he writes. &quot;I only know this thanks to an article in the latest When Saturday Comes all about barmy squad numbers.&quot;  Peep! Peep! Peep! The referee finishes the game, prompting Manchester United&apos;s players to moooch down behind Edwin van der Sar&apos;s goal to applaud their travelling support, before rushing to the bus, heading for the airport and catching the plane home. They&apos;re bestriding Group B like a colossus, having won three games out of three. I&apos;m off home to bestirde my sofa like a colossus and watch Real Madrid v AC Milan, so thanks for your time and your emails and enjoy the rest of the night&apos;s action.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T11:31:00Z", "title": "Champions League: CSKA Moscow v Manchester United - as it happened | Barry Glendenning", "sentences": ["We in Israel know this because of the Macabbi Tel Aviv - CSKA rivalry in basketball."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/21/cska-moscow-manchester-united"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Turkey", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "The apparent inability of Israeli leaders to see their actions as others see them \u2013 that is to say, to put themselves in other people&apos;s shoes \u2013 may partly explain the depth of the outrage with which they greeted the Goldstone report on last January&apos;s Gaza conflict. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems to have been genuinely taken aback by the UN inquiry&apos;s hard-hitting conclusions, in particular its recommendations about the investigation of individual Israeli responsibility for possible war crimes. What Netanyahu, former prime minister Ehud Olmert, opposition leader Tzipi Livni, defence minister Ehud Barak and rightwingers such as foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman viewed as a fully justified act of self-defence in the face of relentless Palestinian rocket attacks was seen by much of the world, despite Israel&apos;s ban on media access, as an appalling, disproportionate assault on a defenceless civilian population. Gaza did enormous damage to Israel&apos;s reputation and interests \u2013 but it is unclear, even now, whether this is fully understood in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Radically differing perceptions, running exclusively in parallel lines, also exacerbate touchy issues such as Israel&apos;s undeclared nuclear weapons arsenal and the apparent contradiction of denying Iran its nuclear &quot;rights&quot;. But sometimes, worlds collide. An unexpected move by Turkey last week to postpone military exercises with Israel suddenly channelled conflicting versions of reality into a direct, head-on crash. Ankara&apos;s decision was its way of expressing its continuing displeasure over Gaza. Prime minister Tayyip Erdogan fell out publicly with Shimon Peres, Israel&apos;s president, over the issue at Davos in January. The row has been simmering ever since. But by dramatically wrecking the flagship exercises, which also involved the US and other Nato members, Turkey effectively forced Israel&apos;s leadership to look at things from the other side&apos;s perspective. The picture thus produced is both instructive and discouraging. Secular Muslim Turkey is (or was) Israel&apos;s best friend in the Middle East. Bilateral trade between the two countries is worth about $3bn a year; military co-operation, including Israeli arms sales, is long-established. Before Gaza, Turkey acted as mediator in talks between Israel and its old foe, Syria. Ankara also offered a link to sympathetic Arab states of the Gulf. Turkey&apos;s economy is growing overall, as is its importance as an energy and commercial hub. In short, it was clear that Turkey was a uniquely important and influential ally. Recognising the value of the link, some Israeli politicians tried to play down the rift, apparently hoping to patch things up. But others, including commentator Amir Oren, looked for different reasons to explain Turkey&apos;s behaviour, refusing to believe Gaza could be the cause. &quot;Erdogan is aiming for a large-scale reconciliation with old enemies: the Armenians, the Syrians, the Greek Cypriots and the Kurds. Israel is a burden for him, not an asset,&quot; Oren said. Other explanations included the assertion that Erdogan had imposed his will on Turkey&apos;s weakened military, which in the past would have resisted his order to cancel the exercises. Meanwhile, Ofra Bangio, a Turkey expert at Tel Aviv University, told the Christian Science Monitor that Turkey&apos;s domestic and foreign policy calculations were shifting as it strengthened its ties with Iraq, Syria and other leading Arab world countries and turned away from an unwelcoming European Union. &quot;In Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu&apos;s ideological framework, Israel doesn&apos;t play a central role,&quot; Bengio said. A senior Israeli foreign ministry official, speaking to the Haaretz newspaper after an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis with Turkey, was even more pessimistic. &quot;It may be that the reality has changed and that the strategic ties we thought existed have simply ended,&quot; the official said. &quot;Maybe we need to be the ones who initiate renewed thinking regarding our ties and must adopt response measures.&quot; On this analysis, Israel&apos;s relationship with Turkey, valuable for so many reasons, may soon be a thing of the past \u2013 an avoidable outcome since the analysis looks fundamentally flawed. They&apos;re not pretending; Turks really are upset about Gaza, as indicated by a much-watched Turkish television drama series depicting clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians that has further inflamed relations. The Turkish public was scandalised by January&apos;s events and Turkey&apos;s politicians have reacted accordingly, as politicians do. But among Israeli leaders, the perception is different. Gaza, a justifiable action, cannot be accepted as the real reason for the row; so ulterior motives and complicated explanations are sought. Inhabiting a parallel world, they just don&apos;t get it.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-22T18:00:00Z", "title": "Israel is in denial over Turkish rage | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["Gaza did enormous damage to Israel&apos;s reputation and interests \u2013 but it is unclear, even now, whether this is fully understood in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.", "Meanwhile, Ofra Bangio, a Turkey expert at Tel Aviv University, told the Christian Science Monitor that Turkey&apos;s domestic and foreign policy calculations were shifting as it strengthened its ties with Iraq, Syria and other leading Arab world countries and turned away from an unwelcoming European Union."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/22/israel-turkey-goldstone-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Michael Green", "Physics", "Science", "University of Cambridge", "Isaac Newton"], "article": "The history of scientific discovery has an alternate history of ifs, many quite quotidian: if the apple had not fallen on Newton&apos;s head, if Archimedes hadn&apos;t overfilled his bath \u2026 And if Michael Green, visiting from London, had not wandered into the canteen at Cern in Switzerland and bumped into John Schwarz, visiting from California, string theory, which for the last couple of decades has been touted as the most likely route to the holy grail of physics \u2013 a theory of everything \u2013 would not now exist. Though Green, who talks very fast, eyes searching my face for signs of comprehension, is not self-aggrandising enough to put it like that. In younger pictures he has a passing resemblance to Harrison Ford; though there are more lines, and his hair has whitened, he is ageing well. He and Schwarz followed their coffee with a month of chats. Nothing came of them, but they quite enjoyed themselves, so they met again, the next year, and the next. These days the field is so competitive that any unsolved problem is pounced on immediately; then it was possible to be more leisurely, to work on other projects, teach students, travel. &quot;We were both bachelors at the time,&quot; Schwarz says, on the phone from California. &quot;We had no responsibilities other than academic responsibilities. So we could devote ourselves pretty singlemindedly to this work.&quot; They began spending summers together at the Aspen Centre for Physics in Colorado, sharing a flat, going to movies, on long hikes \u2013 &quot;lots of people in the subject walk,&quot; says Green \u2013 and talking all the while. Then in 1984, &quot;there was a moment, a day,&quot; says Green, &quot;which I remember well, when suddenly everything fell into place at once. We were working on a particular aspect which we hoped \u2013 there was no reason to expect it to, but we secretly hoped \u2013 would work. And it did. But immediately, within a couple of hours, something else worked, which went far beyond that. And that was totally unexpected.&quot; Green gave a talk on it a few days later. &quot;There weren&apos;t exactly gasps, but clearly what happened was that someone then sent a message to Princeton, where there&apos;s a man called Edward Witten, who&apos;s amazing. And then the first thing that happened was that he produced a paper before we could, using what we&apos;d done to do something more \u2013 which was astonishing, because we had no idea it could be used that way. And it was really his paper that triggered interest among other people.&quot; Although he does not like the term revolution, that moment in 1984 is now called the first revolution in superstring theory. Technically what they had discovered, says Witten, whose peers have compared him to Einstein, was something called anomaly cancellation. &quot;But they really discovered a whole sequence of results. I think string theory would have become extinct without Green and Schwarz.&quot; There have now been thousands of papers on string theory, which attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity by arguing that subatomic particles are strings vibrating through space and time, differing merely in the ways in which they vibrate \u2013 through 10 or 11 dimensions. Green \u2013 who some years later made calculations that proved integral to the second superstring revolution in 1995 \u2013 has this week succeeded Isaac Newton, Charles Babbage, Paul Dirac and Stephen Hawking (among others) to take up the most famous scientific professorship of them all, the Lucasian chair of mathematics at Cambridge University. Green once said that one could &quot;think of the universe as a symphony or a song \u2013 for both are made up of notes produced by strings vibrating in particular ways&quot;. &quot;Did I?&quot; For a second he looks a little hunted. Following Hawking into the limelight is clearly proving disconcerting. Part of the trouble is that the limelight \u2013 otherwise known as public scrutiny \u2013 requires such gross simplifications of unimaginably complex processes. We tend to seize on ideas we can grasp: hence this rather pleasing, if hackneyed, image of the music of the spheres, or, what I want to know about, physics&apos; pursuit of the beautiful. Einstein&apos;s formula, e=mc2, is, for physicists, the apotheosis of beauty \u2013 simple, elegant, a key that unlocks all manner of disparate mysteries; a great criticism of string theory is that it has progressed so far beyond the realms of experimental provability that the only guide to how close Green and co are getting to a solution is how beautiful their formulas are (and yes, that is another gross simplification). Beauty is truth, truth beauty \u2013 Keats might just be able to get away with that, but as a way to explain the universe, surely it&apos;s a little suspect? &quot;The whole history of physics, for centuries, has been one of unifying things,&quot; argues Green. &quot;In the 19th century electricity and magnetism were considered to be two completely disconnected phenomena and then it was realised that they were different aspects of the same thing. And that was a great breakthrough in understanding. And of course more recently, with Einstein, there was an understanding of the implication of ideas about space-time and gravity. &quot;I guess in the biological sciences things work completely differently \u2013 although actually, of course, a great model, the most glamorous thing you can possibly imagine happening, is the work of Crick and Watson, who had no right to believe that there was a simple, elegant solution for how animals, how entire biological systems, procreate \u2013 but they understood the structure of DNA, and with that understanding came along the understanding of how it all worked. And so in a completely different context, and obviously in a very different way, that&apos;s the kind of thing that we are looking for.&quot; But DNA, and the ramifications of DNA, have a good claim to be among the most tested things on the planet. It would require a machine the size of the earth \u2013 &quot;bigger than the solar system, probably&quot;, Green corrects me, equably \u2013 or a lucky cosmological observation, to prove string theory. (The Large Hadron Collider at Cern might possibly find some evidence &quot;to do with black holes, or the actual structure of the string flopping around. But that really is wildly optimistic, and I suspect that&apos;s not going to happen.&quot;) In the absence of such a thing, possible solutions have proliferated so much that, by one estimate, there are now 10500 of them, ie, 1 and 500 zeros (Green suggests there could be even more). Which, from a lay person&apos;s point of view, takes things into the realms of absurdity. Partly because of this, the past few years have seen increasing criticism of string theory as an expensive blind alley; Lee Smolin, for example, an ex-string theorist who in 2006 published The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next, went so far as calling it a tragedy \u2013 all those extraordinarily fine minds, chasing a chimera. Green dismisses these criticisms out of hand. &quot;A couple of years ago there were a couple of books by two particular people who don&apos;t have any particular reason to be knowledgeable about the subject,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Woit [Peter Woit, author of Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law] is a blogger \u2013 he runs an anti-strings blog, he&apos;s an ex-physicist, a PhD I think. He&apos;s at Columbia \u2013 a systems manager or something [he also teaches mathematics]. So he&apos;s not a professional physicist. He has strong views about string theory, which he&apos;s entitled to, and he blogs them. And good for him. &quot;The other one [Smolin] is a physicist who has a view of physics other than string theory and wants to promote that. And the media made a big song and dance about this, which seemed to me to be completely off-scale with what we experience anywhere in any university. The subject&apos;s thriving.&quot; But that was one of their arguments, that the academy is so biased towards string theory \u2013 hiring mostly string theorists, crowning mostly string theorists \u2013 that it has driven out all other ways of seeing (Smolin compared it to deciding that there was only one way to fight cancer, and pouring all available resources into that one way). &quot;People do what they feel is going to be productive,&quot; says Green. &quot;It&apos;s all very well to say they should be doing something else. But there is nothing else.&quot; Furthermore, string theory, Green contends, &quot;isn&apos;t simply something that will, once tested, be either verified or disproved. It&apos;s become much more than that&quot;. It has, for example, provided a way to discuss the previously unexplained nature of radiation from black holes, which apparently contradicted the rules of quantum physics (otherwise known as Hawking radiation). More usefully, from a day-to-day point of view, it may eventually increase our understanding of high-temperature superconductors, which, if they could be mass-produced, would mean we could transfer energy, such as electricity, fantastically cheaply (super-conductors mean no energy is lost as heat). Usefulness can be a bit of a fraught word in the looping corridors of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the leafy edges of Cambridge, however, not least because of recent suggestions from the Science and Technology Facilities Council that levels of future funding will be linked to the degree to which research might contribute to the British economy. Science has, on balance, been very well funded by Labour, says Green, and particle physics and astronomy have so far been more or less exempt from such requirements, but the whole idea has the potential to be &quot;disastrous for certain types of science&quot;. (Though &quot;it would be much more disastrous for non-science. I have colleagues who are historians or linguists or whatever who have no idea what&apos;s going to happen&quot;). &quot;Throw your mind back to when Faraday was working on electromagnetism, when there was apparently no use whatsoever for electricity OR magnetism. There&apos;s a famous quote \u2013 I think it was Gladstone \u2013 who asked, &apos;What use is it&apos;? And Faraday is reputed to have said, &apos;Someday, sir, you will tax it&apos;.&quot; MRIs, now so central to so many medical diagnoses, only exist because physicists needed to develop superconducting magnets for particle accelerators; if economic benefit had been the criterion, no one would have bothered to build such expensive things. The worldwide web came into being at Cern because hundreds of physicists all over Europe needed to be kept abreast of the experiments. &quot;String theory may or may not pan out,&quot; says Green, &quot;but it&apos;s reaching into other areas, which I think is the most exciting thing about it.&quot; Although he confesses to mild regrets that he never seriously explored any other subjects, Green has been interested in particle physics since an inspirational teacher introduced him to it when he was about 13. He grew up in north London, the second child (he has one sibling, an older sister who is an architect and potter) of a Polish civil engineer, and an architect who was born in Tel Aviv when the area constituting the current state of Israel was still part of the Ottoman empire. They met in Paris, where each had gone to study and, by coincidence, left for London just before the second world war began. &quot;Otherwise I probably would never have got born.&quot; I wonder if his parents were religious, and whether he is: I cannot but imagine that routinely contemplating 11 dimensions and a constantly expanding universe (only 20% of the matter in which is currently understood, the rest being dark matter. And that&apos;s not to mention dark energy, or the multiverse) might induce a kind of existential vertigo, and thus nihilism, or belief, or total rejection. Some properly thought-through accommodation with the idea of divinity, at least. Dimensions, particularly, seem to me to require a certain leap of faith. He admits to regularly feeling awe, but the dimensions don&apos;t seem to trouble him much \u2013 mostly because, rather than trying to imagine them in space, they generally exist, for him, as letters and numbers in equations. He doesn&apos;t believe in God. &quot;My parents were very unreligious. Extremely. I presume they influenced me. I&apos;m sort of jealous of people who do have faith. I suppose it depends on the sort of god you have faith in, but it gives you security, I guess. &quot;I get angry with people who are wildly atheist, because they sort of deny any humanity whatsoever. They deny the poetry \u2013 and they talk as if we understand everything, including love, and actually there are beautiful things which can move you in ways that presumably can be understood entirely in terms of complex pathways in the brain, but that&apos;s still not a useful way of thinking of them. So I get annoyed by ultra-atheists who aren&apos;t willing to tolerate anything \u2013 I suppose I&apos;m less atheist than that.&quot; He and his wife, who teaches international development at the Open University, have a nine-year-old daughter, so at 63 he finds himself reading Heidi to her before school, and learning the piano, and in her, he says, with a kind of gentle amazement, he has discovered &quot;a different kind of awe, what your feelings are for someone else, who is more important than anything that you can imagine.&quot; And that, of course, is a whole other dimension, for which no formulas, as far as I know, yet exist. String theory untangled String theory is scientists&apos; great hope for explaining the variety of particles and forces that make up the universe. All the fundamental particles inside atoms are miniscule &quot;strings&quot; of energy. This only makes sense if the universe has six or seven extra dimensions in addition to the familiar three (up-down, left-right and back-forth). The reason we are not aware of them is that they are tightly curled up. The variety of fundamental particles are distinguished from each other by the way strings vibrate rather as the shape of an instrument determines the notes it can produce. The fact the particles are small strings leads to a radical change in the laws of physics at these incredibly small distances with consequences of great potential interest. Many scientists believe understanding the nature of string theory could explain puzzling physical properties of the universe. The Large Hadron Collider, at Cern, could provide evidence for the theory by analysing the collisions of fundamental particles at high energies.

The manuscript was sold at auction by Sotheby&apos;s in 1988 for almost $2m to a book dealer acting on behalf of the German government and is stored in the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach. Now the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, which collects all works published in Israel, says that The Trial should be returned to the country in accordance with the final wishes of Max Brod, a friend of Kafka and the executor of his will. It is a new twist in an intriguing dispute over the writer&apos;s legacy that began a year ago when it was revealed that two reclusive sisters living in Tel Aviv stand to inherit reams of documents and books from a Kafka archive passed down over decades. The National Library has been in court for months trying to claim ownership. Kafka died from tuberculosis in 1924, leaving a surprising set of instructions to Brod: &quot;Dearest Max, My last request: Everything I leave behind me [is] to be burned unread.&quot; But Brod instead published for the first time Kafka&apos;s novels The Trial, The Castle and Amerika. In 1939 Brod fled his home in Prague as the Nazis approached and took a single suitcase of Kafka papers to Tel Aviv, where he started a new life. He later donated manuscripts of The Castle and Amerika to Oxford University, but kept the original of The Trial for himself. After the death of his wife, Brod began a relationship with his assistant, Esther Hoffe. When he died in 1968, he left a will that is now hotly disputed. National Library officials say the will stated that the Kafka documents should pass to them. However, lawyers for the Hoffe family say they were given as a present by Brod to Esther Hoffe and were hers to do with as she wished. She sold documents over several years and when she died two years ago she left the remaining papers to her septuagenarian daughters, Eva and Ruti. &quot;The National Library of Israel, which is a library of the Jewish people too, understands that in the will of Dr Max Brod he asks that these documents should be placed in a public archive and he names the National Library as the first option for that,&quot; said Meir Heller, the library&apos;s lawyer. Heller said that the library was ready to compensate the German archive &quot;as part of this correction of a historical error&quot;, using money held in the Hoffe estate that has been frozen until the dispute is resolved. However, Yeshayahu Etgar, lawyer for the Hoffe sisters, said the documents were a &quot;private inheritance&quot; and this was approved in a 1974 court ruling ratifying Brod&apos;s will. Esther Hoffe was entitled to sell The Trial at auction and it was wrong for the library to try to bring it back. &quot;To bring it back to whom? You should only bring back something to someone who has a legal right to it,&quot; he said. &quot;The National Library has not a hint of a right.&quot; The sisters were in poor financial health and desperately wanted at least part of the frozen funds released. &quot;All this is stupid and Kafkaesque, and the sisters are very upset about it,&quot; said Etgar. Ulrich Raulff, director of the German literature archive, insisted the manuscript &quot;was acquired by us in 1988 completely legally, under the gaze of an international public&quot;. He added: &quot;As far as I&apos;m aware, [the inheritance] was reviewed and deemed legitimate by an Israeli court in the 1970s. In which case, the fact that the papers were delivered to Sotheby&apos;s cannot be considered illegal.&quot; Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin", "publicationDate": "2009-10-24T23:07:11Z", "title": "Israel's National Library adds a final twist to Franz Kafka's Trial", "sentences": ["It is a new twist in an intriguing dispute over the writer&apos;s legacy that began a year ago when it was revealed that two reclusive sisters living in Tel Aviv stand to inherit reams of documents and books from a Kafka archive passed down over decades.", "In 1939 Brod fled his home in Prague as the Nazis approached and took a single suitcase of Kafka papers to Tel Aviv, where he started a new life."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/25/israel-library-franz-kafka-trial"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "United Nations", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "There is nothing ordinary about this advocacy campaign for a large UN institution. The lights dim before a packed audience and a slideshow begins: images of Gaza in conflict, people fleeing their homes, buildings on fire. Then stands Chris Gunness, the chief spokesman of the UN Relief and Works Agency, the organisation responsible for the support and welfare of Palestinian refugees. &quot;I am a warehouse,&quot; he says. &quot;I am a dying warehouse, the victim of an excruciatingly painful fire that burned me down.&quot; It is the start of a remarkable 20-minute, one-man play intended for Israeli audiences but so far unwelcome in Israeli theatres. It tells the story of the main UN warehouse in Gaza, a storage point for food and aid for a million Palestinians, and how it was hit repeatedly by Israeli artillery shells, some loaded with white phosphorous, during the Gaza war \u2013 how it was set ablaze and burnt to the ground. This is a story that &quot;until now has remained buried, untold,&quot; Gunness said at the debut performance of his show at the French Cultural Centre, east Jerusalem, on Wednesday night. His play, Building Understanding: Epitaph for a Warehouse, is a challenge to the criticism the UN has faced within Israel. Many aid organisations and human rights groups highlighting the Palestinian cause have faced increasing opposition since the war, as has Richard Goldstone, the South African judge who authored a highly critical UN report accusing Israel and Palestinian militant groups of war crimes. Some critics, among them the Israeli right and US neoconservatives, regard UNRWA in particular as unfairly and unnecessarily perpetuating the Palestinian refugee issue and their claim to a right of return. The organisation insists it was established by a UN resolution and that it offers vital food, shelter and education to millions of people who would otherwise go without. It says the refugee issue should be resolved as part of a final-status Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Nonetheless, this is an unusual approach for the UN. It began because Gunness, a British former BBC correspondent, was frequently on air during the war highlighting the damage to life and property. That led to an invitation by an Israeli artist to take part in a project about storage space, for which he offered the story of his warehouse. There were heckles from the Tel Aviv crowd at the first show, of what was an earlier version of the play. About 20 people, out of an audience of around 100, walked out. The script was refined and the play then booked at two Israeli theatres, in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Both later cancelled before the first performance. Gunness defended his work. &quot;This is about as far away from propaganda as I think you can get,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a genuine attempt to tell a story in an apolitical way. We were overly meticulous in making quite sure there was no politics on both sides.&quot; They chose not to include clips of Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, talking about the war and the warehouse. The centre of what is an unexpectedly compelling performance is the warehouse manager, a phlegmatic Australian UN staffer called Jodie Clark, who was in the compound on the day of the attack. She saw shells land close by her, showering her with concrete. She telephoned the Israeli military to explain that their shells were hitting the UN. In the compound were six trucks, each filled with thousands of litres of fuel. &quot;It took us two hours to convince them they were hitting the UN compound,&quot; she said in a video interview during the show. Her matter-of-fact account is dramatic. She describes how, with a colleague, she ran out as the white phosphorous shells rained down. White phosphorous burns on contact with air, and burns through flesh to the bone. She tried to rescue the trucks, armed only with a fire extinguisher and a wooden stick. &quot;We flicked the white phos out from under the vehicle,&quot; she said. The trucks were saved and driven away to safety, sparing a greater fire, but the warehouse was hit and burned to the ground at a cost of more than $10m. The play was so popular Gunness had to give two showings and book a third for later this week. At the end of the performance, he talks of the &quot;unanswered questions&quot; of why the war unfolded as it did and of the suffering of Gazans and the people of southern Israel, who were targeted by Palestinian rocket attacks. &quot;Until we have answers to these questions the Palestinian people and the people of Israel will continue to live in fear and insecurity,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-29T19:24:57Z", "title": "Playing with fire: UN turns Gaza shelling into theatre", "sentences": ["There were heckles from the Tel Aviv crowd at the first show, of what was an earlier version of the play.", "The script was refined and the play then booked at two Israeli theatres, in Tel Aviv and Haifa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/29/un-play-on-gaza-shelling"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The far right", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "In Jewish communities throughout Israel and the Diaspora, everyone remembers where they were the night Yitzhak Rabin was killed. Fourteen years ago, Israel&apos;s JFK moment occurred, and the country has never fully recovered from the massive blow dealt to the fabric of Israeli society. With three bullets, assassin Yigal Amir managed to irreversibly derail the peace process, as well as drive a wedge through the heart of the political system, splitting left from right and religious from secular in an unparalleled act of division. The revulsion felt in my northwest London community was, perversely, a positive sign in terms of our expectations for the state of Israel. When the news first broke, we 15-year-olds were doing what we did best on a Saturday night, standing outside Carmelli&apos;s on Golders Green High Road, and the importance of what had just happened went over our heads \u2013 at first. The Israelis among us reacted the most quickly, realising that a monumental event had just occurred, and by the time we were back at JFS on Monday morning, the school was shrouded in gloom and despondency, our teachers swift to teach us the moral lessons of the shooting. We spent that afternoon crowded into classrooms, watching his funeral broadcast live from Jerusalem, the image of his granddaughter&apos;s graveside breakdown seared indelibly on our minds. During subsequent trips to Israel with our youth movements, classes were held on the subject of his death, usually accompanied by graphic footage of the slaying itself, by way of teaching us about the perils of extremism, the folly of violence, and the speed with which an entire region&apos;s political journey could so abruptly change course. However, the main lesson our teachers intended us to take from the murder was that this was not the Jewish way, nor the Israeli way either. Let the unenlightened and barbaric Arab states around us settle their differences via the sword, we were told \u2013 we preferred settling scores around the negotiating table, and thus Amir&apos;s actions were utterly deplorable, and entirely at odds with both our religious teachings and communal traditions. They had a point: after all, Judaism certainly does not allow for such base behaviour, and taking the law into one&apos;s own hands is completely proscribed by Jewish law. Yet to view Rabin&apos;s assassination as a one-off aberration rather than the culmination of years of incitement and provocation was to take a dangerously out-of-context view of the event, and \u2013 by continuing to do so even today \u2013 those making such assertions run the risk of similar attacks being carried out in the future. The settler camp continue to brand anyone disagreeing with their views as a traitor (such as Shimon Peres), a self-hating Jew (Uri Avnery), or an antisemite (Barack Obama), and call for direct action to put a stop to their &quot;crimes against the Jewish people&quot;. Religious self-righteousness is a powerful intoxicant, and more often than not proves a highly potent ingredient to throw into the already incendiary mix of domestic politics. At the same time, even the secular nationalists in Israel \u2013 fronted by Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu brigade \u2013 think nothing of branding the entire Israeli-Arab community as mutinous fifth columnists, paving the way for demonisation and distortion to fill the void left by previously-level headed approaches to the regional conflict. Rabin&apos;s attempt to broker peace with the Palestinians is still viewed by many on the right as an unpardonable sin, with Haaretz reporting that rightwing activists plan to hand out fliers at Jerusalem schools &quot;urging students to boycott memorial ceremonies commemorating Rabin&apos;s assassination&quot;:  The fliers condemn the assassination, which was carried out by extreme rightist Yigal Amir, but also speak out against continuing &apos;Rabin&apos;s legacy&apos; ... &apos;Handing weapons over to terrorists, abandoning areas of the homeland, and disregard for the life of Jews&apos; are also characteristic of Rabin&apos;s legacy, the fliers said, one which &apos;brought [about] the Oslo agreement as well as terror and bombings in the name of peace with our enemies&apos;. The fliers conclude by saying that &apos;Rabin&apos;s legacy failed; Rabin caused a disaster.&apos;  In the 14 years since Rabin was gunned down, the country has swung decisively to the right, and Rabin&apos;s chief rival has once again assumed power on a ticket of defiance towards both the Palestinians and the world at large. Settler leaders continue to crow about Netanyahu having forced Obama to back down over the issue of settlement expansion, and with the bit between their teeth they appear as confident as ever that the incumbent government will support the ongoing illegal occupation of the West Bank come what may. On the other side of the political divide, the peace camp lies fractured and fragmented, a pale imitation of its former self. While tens of thousands of well-meaning activists will descend on Rabin Square on Saturday night to commemorate his passing, by the time the banners are packed away and the flags furled up once more, the brief burst of optimism will dissipate into the Tel Aviv night, just as it has after every year&apos;s memorial rally to date. Like it or not, the right have retaken the country, lock, stock and barrel \u2013 and with the impotent current crop of leftwing parties making precious little ground against them, the omens don&apos;t look good for those desperately seeking a new direction for the country.

Ali al-Faraj purchased Portsmouth almost a month ago after the club&apos;s previous owner Sulaiman al-Fahim \u2013 who is expected to attend Saturday&apos;s Premier League game against Wigan Athletic in his role as non-executive chairman \u2013 failed to meet the squad&apos;s salaries for September. The league&apos;s bottom side have avoided a repeat of that unhappy scenario by securing the short-term loan from Chainrai, with the influx of cash to be spent on the wages, totalling around \u00a31.8m, and meeting costs to other creditors. Faraj, whose brother Ahmed may also attend Saturday&apos;s game at Fratton Park, will effectively use the loan to buy him more time as he seeks to refinance the club. While he had shown an interest in purchasing Portsmouth from Alexandre Gaydamak in the summer, he ended up rushing through a deal for 90% of the club in four whirlwind days when Fahim&apos;s lack of available funds became clear, with the new owner now coming to terms with the structure of the business&apos;s current debts. A transfer embargo imposed by the Premier League remains in place with Portsmouth in &quot;ongoing dialogue&quot; with Chelsea over the restructuring of payments still due on Glen Johnson&apos;s \u00a34m transfer from Stamford Bridge in 2007. Agreement has been reached with Arsenal and Watford over fees owed for Lassana Diarra, the \u00a35.5m midfielder now at Real Madrid, and the \u00a31.8m forward Tommy Smith. Yet, while Faraj is still determining how best to stabilise the club financially, he will not seek to sell to either Chainrai or Levi Kushnir, the businessmen who had also been part of the original consortium put together by the chief executive, Peter Storrie, and the agent Pini Zahavi back in August to purchase Pompey from Gaydamak. The pair have attended the team&apos;s last two games as guests of Ahmed al-Faraj, with Chainrai now providing the loan to ease the club&apos;s short-term concerns. However, Storrie has stressed that neither is considered a potential new owner, or even a director, at Fratton Park, with Faraj \u2013 who has yet to attend a game in person \u2013 apparently set upon a long-term involvement on the south coast.

Instead of doing their utmost to assist those fleeing war-torn, famine-stricken homelands, many politicians have instead placed hurdle after hurdle in the asylum seekers&apos; path, conveniently ignoring the state&apos;s duties as a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, when it comes to the man on the Israeli street, a far more heartening approach to the destitute migrants is apparent, as was exemplified during the last 10 days in response to an urgent call for action in south Tel Aviv. When food supplies for the local refugee shelter were on the verge of running out, volunteers launched a massive appeal for provisions and funds to replenish the storerooms, entering into a race against time to ensure that none of the shelter&apos;s residents went hungry. Despite the urgency of the situation, none of the shelter&apos;s staff had high hopes for the scale of the response from the public. Times are tough in Israel at present, in line with the rest of the world, and it seemed that it couldn&apos;t be a less opportune moment to be soliciting donations. Yet within hours of the appeal going live, the shelter was deluged with vast amounts of food and other vital supplies, far above anyone&apos;s expectations. Almost two weeks later, with the storerooms now boasting enough basic foodstuffs to feed the residents for at least the next two months, the stream of contributions continues to pour in. Most of the donors come from low-income backgrounds, a statistic in line with studies showing the worse off give proportionately more of their income to charity than their richer peers. (For example, the top fifth of UK households give less than 1% of their total income, while the poorest tenth give three times as much, or 3% of their income). At the same time, another major factor in the appeal&apos;s success was the cultural heritage of the Jewish donors \u2013 almost everyone giving a donation was Jewish, whether religious or secular, and the culture of giving to charity is one which permeates every sector of global Jewish society. In Jewish law, a person is obliged to give 10% of their income to charity, year in, year out; to do so is not viewed as the height of altruistic endeavour, but simply an adherence to a fundamental God-given command. The Hebrew for charity \u2013 tzedaka \u2013 derives from the word &quot;righteousness&quot;, and the concept of performing acts of tzedaka is viewed as one of the defining features of a righteous, God-fearing Jew. Some see it as a central tenet of the faith because it recognises not only that redistribution of wealth needs to occur, but that this must happen, because ultimately everything belongs to God, and he apportions it to us with the understanding that reallocation to the needy will occur. At the same time, observation of the laws of tzedaka is not the preserve of the ultra-orthodox, partly because history has taught the Jewish people that if they don&apos;t look out for the weak and poor amongst them, then it is likely no one else will. That is not to say that their patronage is only directed towards Jewish causes \u2013 as demonstrated by the response to the appeal on behalf of the African refugees. Rather, the giving is rooted in the underlying understanding that in order to properly function, the onus is on society&apos;s haves to look after the have-nots, whoever they may be. The most striking, and saddening, aspect of the success of the shelter&apos;s fundraising drive was the disparity between those answering their cry for help at street level and those making policy decisions in the Knesset. Viewing the likes of the African refugees as entirely deserving of state assistance should be a given, both according to Jewish law and the basic human social contract. However, the powers-that-be in Israel insist that the asylum seekers pose a serious threat to Israeli society \u2013 economically, demographically and otherwise \u2013 and consequently are loath to do anything which will be seen to encourage more migrants to enter the country. In a country created as a refuge for a people towards whom the rest of the world turned their back less than a century ago, it is telling that today&apos;s crop of leaders refuse to practise what they preach. Fortunately, not all of the state&apos;s citizens are prepared to follow their politicians&apos; hypocritical lead.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-06T13:00:01Z", "title": "Charity makes us who we are | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["However, when it comes to the man on the Israeli street, a far more heartening approach to the destitute migrants is apparent, as was exemplified during the last 10 days in response to an urgent call for action in south Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/06/tel-aviv-refugees-judaism-charity"}, {"tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "Pub, Manchester The Exchange has transformed its studio space into a working boozer for a month-long celebration of pub culture.

Public Property is a dark new comedy by Sam Peter Jackson about a publicist whose client is caught in a sexual scandal. Nigel Harman, formerly of EastEnders, who acquitted himself well on his last West End appearance in Richard Greenberg&apos;s Three Days Of Rain (although rather less so in BBC1&apos;s seriously ropey drama Hotel Babylon), plays the publicist, Larry, who is required to get a newsman (Robert Daws) out of trouble when he is caught in a compromising situation by photographers.

In fact, I Found My Horn is based on a book by journalist Jasper Rees, a partly autobiographical mid-life crisis tale of his stumbling into the attic and fingering an instrument (ooh, matron!) that he&apos;d abandoned decades earlier \u2013 his French horn. Having uncovered said instrument, his life-affirming aim was to play a Mozart concerto for a paying audience. This one-man play has been adapted from the book by Rees himself alongside actor-writer Jonathan Guy Lewis, a similarly lapsed horn player who was in Hampstead Theatre&apos;s production of Michael Frayn&apos;s Alphabetical Order earlier this year.

No, the simple reason for doing it, Attal says, is that he loves Paris and making films. &quot;I was born in Tel Aviv,&quot; he says. &quot;But I came here when I was one, and grew up in the suburbs. I am really Parisian.&quot; There is, however, another less prosaic reason for taking the job: &quot;It took me a day,&quot; he says, sipping an orange juice and chewing gum. The Paris tourist board gave Attal free rein, but with a small brief: he had to advertise the city, of course, but more importantly, he had to use the less well-known parts of Paris, not the usual shots of the Eiffel tower and the Louvre. &quot;I did get the Eiffel in,&quot; Attal says; but he shot it in an unlikely way \u2013 at night, with a metro zooming in front. Instead, Kisses from Paris is a journey off the beaten track, taking in the sights tourists tend to miss: there&apos;s a rock concert in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes, as well as footage shot around the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, the Palais du Tokyo, and the flea market at Saint\u00a0Ouen. It&apos;s an attempt to show the multi-cultural side of Paris, its art and music scenes, but it is also clearly designed to lure the young. The actors are young, beautiful and appealingly scruffy. They meet, fall for each other, and spend the day wandering around with their hormones raging. &quot;I don&apos;t want to leave Paris,&quot; moans Zo\u00e9 Schellenberg, who plays the young woman, in between passionate kisses. Attal&apos;s work is part of a burgeoning genre, the viral film, in which the lines between art and advert are blurred. The result, it is hoped, should take on a life of its own on the web. The fashion designer Vanessa Bruno recently dressed French it-girl Lou Doillon in her floaty clothes for a short film directed by St\u00e9phanie di Giusto. Released instead of a catalogue, the film debuted on Bruno&apos;s website and was shown in cinemas all over Paris. Marion Cotillard, who played \u00c9dith Piaf in the 2007 movie La Vie en Rose, starred in Lady Noire for Christian Dior, while the Swiss watchmakers IWC persuaded John Malkovich to make an appearance in a piece called Pilots. &quot;That watch was made for pilots,&quot; he tells two young airmen witheringly. &quot;There are no real pilots any more.&quot; Mariann Wenckehim, a brand expert for the London firm 20/20, says: &quot;A 30-second TV commercial or print ad can&apos;t provoke the same intensity, the same edge as a short film. A film that has a sense of humour and engages youth is definitely more interesting. Brands want to inspire, rather than shout.&quot; Paris certainly needs to promote itself. Although still the most visited city in the world, it has fallen behind London and Berlin in terms of cool. With Kisses from Paris, Attal hopes to do for the French capital what Doisneau did when he took two young people and turned them into an iconic image, still instantly recognisable almost 60 years on.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-09T22:00:01Z", "title": "Viral movies \u2013 from Paris with love", "sentences": ["&quot;I was born in Tel Aviv,&quot; he says."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/09/viral-movies-kisses-from-paris"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Human rights", "Gaza", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "Law"], "article": "America&apos;s leading human rights organisation has accused Israel and its supporters of an &quot;organised campaign&quot; of false allegations and misinformation, including &quot;extremely personal attacks&quot; on its staff, in an attempt to discredit the group over its reports of war crimes in Gaza. Human Rights Watch (HRW) ties the campaign \u2013 which has included accusations that the group&apos;s reports on the Jewish state are written by &quot;anti-Israel ideologues&quot; and that it has sought funds from Saudi Arabia \u2013 to a statement by a senior official in the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office in June pledging to &quot;dedicate time and manpower to combating&quot; human rights organisations. The criticism began with Israeli pressure groups and rightwing blogs, but in recent weeks it has drawn the support of influential individuals such as Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and Nobel peace prize winner, and HRW&apos;s own founder, Robert Bernstein, who said the organisation&apos;s reports were &quot;helping those who wish to turn Israel into a pariah state&quot;. He called on HRW to focus more on abuses by Arab governments. Iain Levine, HRW&apos;s programme director, said that while the organisation had long attracted criticism, in recent months there had been significant attempts to intimidate and discredit it. &quot;I really hesitate to use words like conspiracy, but there is a feeling that there is an organised campaign, and we&apos;re seeing from different places what would appear to be co-ordinated attacks ... from some of the language and arguments used it would seem as if there has been discussion,&quot; he said.&quot;We are having to spend a lot of time repudiating the lies, the falsehoods, the misinformation.&quot; Spearheading some of the criticism is NGO Monitor in Jerusalem, an Israeli group funded by wealthy US donors which includes Wiesel on its advisory board. It has accused HRW staff of having a &quot;political agenda&quot; to attack Israel. Criticism has particularly focused on the director of HRW&apos;s Middle East division, Sarah Leah Whitson, over a visit to Saudi Arabia. NGO Monitor accused Whitson of attempting to raise money from Saudi officials by highlighting HRW&apos;s criticism of Israel, a charge also made in a comment piece for the Wall Street Journal online that was subsequently widely distributed by the most powerful of the pro-Israel lobby groups, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Shortly afterwards, the director of policy planning in the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office, Ron Dermer, denounced Human Rights Watch. &quot;We are going to dedicate time and manpower to combating these groups; we are not going to be sitting ducks in a pond for the human rights groups to shoot at us with impunity,&quot; he said. Levine said that Whitson&apos;s visit to Saudi Arabia was similar to trips by other HRW officials to Tokyo, Johannesburg and Tel Aviv to win the support of individuals interested in supporting human rights in their own countries and abroad. &quot;This idea that somehow the Saudi government is going to be able to influence us is nonsense. It&apos;s a cardinal principle of the organisation that we don&apos;t take government money,&quot; he said. But Levine added that Dermer&apos;s threat marked the escalation of the campaign against HRW. &quot;It was clear that you had a new government in Israel under Binyamin Netanyahu with a harder right approach. He certainly recognised that the criticisms of Israeli conduct in Gaza from a humanitarian law perspective was extremely politically damaging,&quot; he said. Levine said he believes many of the attacks were aimed at distracting attention from the report of the UN investigator, Richard Goldstone, which was highly critical of Israel&apos;s killing of civilians in its three-week attack on Gaza that started last December. Goldstone is a former member of the HRW board and the group has strongly backed his report. &quot;We have been under enormous pressure and tremendous attacks, some of them very personal, as have been the attacks against Richard Goldstone with really vituperative language used to describe him: obsequious Jew, self-loathing Jew and all the rest of it,&quot; said Levine. HRW came under renewed criticism last month from its founder, Robert Bernstein, in an opinion article in the New York Times in which he accused it of criticising Israel more than undemocratic governments in the rest of the Middle East. &quot;Human Rights Watch has lost critical perspective on a conflict in which Israel has been repeatedly attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah, organisations that go after Israeli citizens and use their own people as human shields,&quot; he wrote. Bernstein accused HRW of basing its accusations against Israel on the testimony of Palestinian &quot;witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers&quot;. Levine said that Bernstein went public only after the HRW board rejected his call for a change in direction. A few days later, Wiesel and others published a letter in the Guardian drawing attention to Bernstein&apos;s article, accusing HRW of playing a &quot;destructive role&quot; and calling for a review by the organisation&apos;s board. In September, HRW was shaken by accusations that its military expert and collector of war memorabilia, Marc Garlasco, is a Nazi sympathiser after describing an SS jacket as &quot;so cool&quot; in comments on a blog. Both he and HRW vigorously deny the charge, but Garlasco has been suspended pending an investigation. At the time, Levine called the attacks on Garlasco the latest salvo in the Israeli government&apos;s campaign &quot;to eliminate the space for legitimate criticism&quot; of the Israeli military.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-13T15:53:29Z", "title": "Israel 'personally attacking human rights group' after Gaza war criticism", "sentences": ["Levine said that Whitson&apos;s visit to Saudi Arabia was similar to trips by other HRW officials to Tokyo, Johannesburg and Tel Aviv to win the support of individuals interested in supporting human rights in their own countries and abroad."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/13/israel-human-rights-watch-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Alcohol", "Society", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "According to Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s teen-drinking problem is close to becoming an epidemic, in light of new data revealing the level of alcohol abuse among the country&apos;s minors. The state&apos;s anti-drug authority is in the process of launching a major drive to tackle the phenomenon, with the government announcing this weekend that 27m shekels will be set aside to fund the campaign. Around a third of teenagers got drunk in the last year, which the prime minister called &quot;a terrible figure&quot;, before noting: &quot;20% of boys in the sixth grade report having drunk an alcoholic beverage, or that they drink an alcoholic beverage once a week. That is the second largest figure in Europe&quot;. However, while the figures are cause for concern amongst concerned parents and politicians, some comfort must be taken by the fact that Israel lags far behind countries such as the UK when it comes to the overall approach its citizens take towards alcohol consumption. Just because drinking is on the increase among Israeli teens does not mean that wider Israeli society is in danger of being dragged into a spiral of debauchery and degradation \u2013 at least, not in the short term, given the influence of an older generation who display a far more level-headed attitude towards alcohol. Israel does not have a history of hard drinking, and as such has developed a culture far less reliant on alcoholic entertainment than exists in other western countries. For example, while Israeli football fans are renowned for their passionate exuberance when following their teams, barely any members of match-day crowds are drunk in the stadiums, thus avoiding one of the chief impediments to crowd control faced by European countries. Similarly, Israeli clubs and bars are \u2013 comparatively \u2013 largely devoid of the type of aggression and hostility so prevalent in towns and cities across Britain, where the effects of binge drinking have a devastating effect on what should be an amicable night out for thousands of revellers. Israel&apos;s alcohol crisis further differs from Britain&apos;s in terms of the demographic makeup of problem drinkers; whereas in the UK members of the native population lead the way in the drinking stakes, in Israel the phenomenon is more confined to immigrant communities. According to the Jerusalem Post:  [The] youth-at-risk charity Elem found that there has been a significant increase in the number of youths using and abusing alcohol, especially among immigrant teens. In addition, a State Comptroller&apos;s Report on alcohol and drug abuse among Ethiopian teenagers found that two-thirds reported experimenting with alcohol and 40% admitted to getting drunk.  While the government is promising to enact various stringent policies to combat teen drinking \u2013 including a prohibition on purchasing alcohol on behalf of minors \u2013 the underlying reasons for young Israelis increasingly turning to drink require far wider-reaching measures in order to offset their effects. Disaffection, boredom and hopelessness among teenagers from low-income backgrounds is a major contributor to such deviant behaviour, and in a country where the gap between rich and poor is growing ever wider, societal unrest is doomed to continue as long as such issues remain unaddressed. However, Israel&apos;s leaders must also recognise that it is their own cleaving to western culture that encourages the nation&apos;s youth to ape the behaviour of their European and American peers, who they view either through the prism of Hollywood films and MTV or up close and personal on trips abroad. Tel Aviv already resembles any other decadent and permissive city across Europe, and the likes of Jerusalem, Haifa and Netanya are not far behind. Such a shift is no bad thing in itself, but along with the positives of such transformations inevitably comes the darker, more corrupting side of a liberal lifestyle. Netanyahu has stated his intention to &quot;create a public atmosphere that opposes the drinking of alcohol, especially among teens&quot;, but in reality there is little hope of turning back the clock. The only sectors of the public that reject alcohol consumption are religious Jewish and Muslim communities, and even in the case of the former alcohol is not considered an out-and-out taboo. Among secular Israelis, there is no reason to expect alcohol to be eschewed any more than nightclubs, beach life or any other leisure activity currently deemed socially acceptable. If Netanyahu was serious about wanting to wean the nation off drink, he should go the whole hog and ban the substance in the same way as other drugs are prohibited \u2013 but to do so would pit him against not only vast swathes of the electorate, but big business as well and all the political clout such companies and investors wield. Assuming he will not tread such a path, he will have to recognise that it is all but impossible to fully tame the beast, and that the best he can hope for is that Israeli youth follow their elders&apos; lead and not turn low-level drinking into an all-out culture of bingeing and excess. Despite the recent uptick in consumption, there is no reason Israel can&apos;t keep a lid on the drinking culture, and predictions of Israeli society&apos;s demise seem both pessimistic and premature.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-18T11:30:00Z", "title": "Capping Israel's teen drinking | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv already resembles any other decadent and permissive city across Europe, and the likes of Jerusalem, Haifa and Netanya are not far behind."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/18/israel-teen-drinking-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Rangers", "Champions League", "Celtic", "Europa League", "Scotland", "George Burley", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "With its leading lights on the brink of ejection from their respective European tournaments, and the national team rudderless and long since dumped from the World Cup, Scottish football will be as attractive to investors as an abandoned silver mine at the moment. It is not looking too appealing to fans, either. The disenchantment is pervasive. Even non-Old Firm followers who are enjoying a certain schadenfreude over the current wretchedness of Celtic and Rangers will be embittered by Scotland&apos;s latest embarrassment \u2013 the 3-0 defeat by Wales \u2013 the subsequent dismissal of George Burley and the growing impression that potential successors of genuine substance will be instructing their kids to tell the man from the Scottish FA &quot;daddy&apos;s not in&quot; when he comes to the door. It is a measure of the condition of the game that, of its three main planks, Rangers \u2013 who could depart the Champions League as early as Tuesday \u2013 are still not quite as badly affected by rot as the other two. Until this week&apos;s events unfold, Walter Smith&apos;s side at least retain an outside chance of staying in the Champions League and a more feasible prospect of finishing third in Group G and parachuting into the Europa League. Tony Mowbray&apos;s team, on the other hand, appear certain to be evicted from that competition on 2 December, when they play their penultimate match at home to Hapoel Tel Aviv. With only two points from four matches so far in Group C, Celtic have to win their last two games and trust Hamburg lose both of theirs. In their four outings, they have scored just two goals (only one at home) and, as Mowbray has acknowledged, it is unlikely his team will show much improvement without a recruitment drive in January. Rangers, too, have just two points from four matches in the premier tournament. Curiously, these have been obtained from relatively reasonable performances abroad \u2013 against VfB Stuttgart and Unirea Urziceni, of Romania \u2013 while their games at Ibrox have yielded successive, humiliating 4-1 defeats by Sevilla and Unirea. Understandably, there is an edge to Tuesday&apos;s meeting with the Germans at Ibrox, although Stuttgart have appeared at least as moderate as Rangers in Europe and palpably worse domestically. Presently 15th in the Bundesliga, head coach Markus Babbel has been given the normally portentous declaration of full support by his president. Predictably, Smith claimed Stuttgart&apos;s domestic form was misleading and that they are better than their league placing suggests. &quot;What you have to remember about Stuttgart is that they had a bad start to last season as well,&quot; said Smith. &quot;They&apos;ll settle down and they are perfectly capable of reversing their bad start. As for ourselves, we will have to improve dramatically on our last performance at Ibrox, when we lost to Unirea. &quot;That was the poorest I&apos;ve seen since my return to Ibrox. At least in the match against Sevilla, we played well for an hour and lost the goals in a rush during a bad period. Against the Romanians, we never got going.&quot; Smith&apos;s eulogising of Stuttgart, of course, is classic manager-speak. The visual evidence suggests that, apart from leaders and long odds-on favourites Sevilla (already qualified with 10 points), the group is among the weakest imaginable. With the campaign two-thirds completed, Rangers, Stuttgart and Unirea have mustered a total of one victory, the Romanians&apos; triumph in Glasgow. Which means Rangers not only have to beat Stuttgart on Tuesday, but overtake Unirea, who are three points ahead with two games remaining. With their final outing a visit to Seville, the Scottish champions seem an unlikely antidote to the national despondency.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-22T00:10:11Z", "title": "Walter Smith's men an unlikely panacea for Scotland's woes | Glenn Gibbons", "sentences": ["Tony Mowbray&apos;s team, on the other hand, appear certain to be evicted from that competition on 2 December, when they play their penultimate match at home to Hapoel Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/22/rangers-champions-league-celtic-europa-league"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Mir Hossein Mousavi", "World news", "Iranian presidential election 2009"], "article": "A former Iranian vice president has been sentenced to six years in jail after being accused of fomenting unrest to overthrow the government, his lawyer said today. Mohammad Ali Abtahi is the most senior reformer to face imprisonment following the disputed presidential election in June. Abtahi was vice president for parliamentary and legal affairs during the 1997-2005 presidency of Mohammad Khatami. The lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, said he planned to appeal against the verdict. He has 20 days to submit the appeal. Abtahi was released on $700,000 (\u00a3425,000) bail after the verdict was delivered. As news of the latest sentence emerged, the opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, called on the government to stop intimidating people. &quot;The government should not intimidate people to change their path \u2026 this movement will continue and we are ready to pay any price,&quot; Mousavi was quoted as saying on his Kaleme website. Mousavi&apos;s remarks coincided with a gathering by moderates to commemorate the killing of a dissident nationalist couple, stabbed to death by &quot;rogue&quot; agents in 1998. The killing of Dariush Forouhar and his wife, who headed the illegal but tolerated Iran Nation party, and at least two other secularist figures, outraged Iranian society. Iran&apos;s security forces have warned the opposition not to take part in demonstrations, in an attempt to avoid a revival of the protests that erupted after the presidential elections on 12 June in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad secured a second term. The turmoil after the election was the worst in Iran since its 1979 Islamic revolution. Authorities deny vote-rigging and portrayed the unrest as a foreign-backed bid to undermine the Islamic state. A key part of the government&apos;s strategy has been the mass trial of reformist political figures accused of supporting the post-election unrest and seeking to topple the regime through a &quot;velvet revolution&quot;. Abtahi&apos;s daughter, Fatemeh Abtahi, was quoted by Kaleme as saying that security agents searched her father&apos;s Tehran home in his presence yesterday, after which he was taken to a court where he was told about his sentence and then returned to jail. Abtahi made televised confessions after his arrest in which he admitted provoking people to riot. His family and fellow reformers said the confessions were obtained under duress. Abtahi was a top adviser to pro-reform cleric Mehdi Karoubi, who finished fourth in the presidential elections. Kaleme said his lawyer would seek his release on bail. Iran&apos;s judiciary said last week that five people have been sentenced to death and 81 have received jail terms of up to 15 years in connection with protests and violence after the poll, but it did not give their names. The head of a hardline political party, Mohammad Nabi Habibi, called yesterday for Mousavi to face trial for spreading the &quot;big lie&quot; of vote fraud. Any legal action against Mousavi, who came second in the election, could trigger new street protests by his backers. Meanwhile Iran&apos;s military has said it will begin large-scale air defence drills today, with a cleric in the Revolutionary Guards warning that the Islamic Republic would fire missiles at &quot;the heart of Tel Aviv&quot; if attacked. The war games, due to last five days, are intended to help protect Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, according to Iranian media. The declaration came as a UN committee voted to approve a non-binding resolution condemning Iran for its crackdown on protesters following the presidential elections. The resolution also repeated annual criticism of Iran&apos;s human rights record, including the use of torture and an increasing execution rate. Iran&apos;s UN ambassador, Mohammad Khazaee, dismissed the resolution as politically motivated.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-22T14:29:00Z", "title": "Former vice president of Iran sentenced over election protests", "sentences": ["Meanwhile Iran&apos;s military has said it will begin large-scale air defence drills today, with a cleric in the Revolutionary Guards warning that the Islamic Republic would fire missiles at &quot;the heart of Tel Aviv&quot; if attacked."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/22/mohammad-ali-abtahi-iran-protests-jailed"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "France", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "A glimmer of hope in the moribund Middle East peace process surfaced in Paris recently when Nicolas Sarkozy separately hosted both the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Reports suggested that Netanyahu passed on a message to his Syrian counterpart about reopening peace negotiations. Though both leaders were quick to play down any talk of detente, recent announcements in both Tel Aviv and Damascus suggest that talks &quot;without preconditions&quot; may not be far off. With US-led Israeli-Palestinian negotiations stillborn because of Netanyahu&apos;s intransigence on settlement freezes, could a French-mediated opening of the Syrian track provide an alternative avenue for peace? On the one hand, there is no reason to get excited yet. The fanfare around these visits owes more to Sarkozy&apos;s desire for France and the EU to appear involved in the Middle East than to any political breakthrough. Moreover, expressing a desire for negotiations is not the same as their taking place. Though both sides now seem willing to countenance talks without &quot;preconditions&quot; this hasn&apos;t made the demands of the past 40 years evaporate overnight. Speaking in Istanbul recently, Assad said: &quot;We have no preconditions for peace, but we cannot ignore our rights.&quot; These &quot;rights&quot; are a full return of the occupied Golan Heights, something Netanyahu swore in May that he would never do. Similarly, Israel&apos;s desire to end Syrian support for Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas in return for peace contradicts Assad&apos;s hopes to position himself as a bridge between the west and these rejectionist elements. The new rhetoric of &quot;no preconditions&quot; is therefore a misnomer as neither side is actually offering anything different. However, though talks may eventually break down on these intractable points, both leaders see the value of speaking the language of peace for short-term gain. For Netanyahu, negotiations with Syria offer more tangible benefits than the convoluted process with the Palestinian Authority. Syria represents a negotiating partner that can actually deliver, unlike the fractured and divided Palestinians. Similarly, Assad wields far more influence over Hezbollah and Hamas than the beleaguered Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Even if negotiations with Syria fail, Israel might expect a period of limited Iranian influence and comparative calm from Damascus&apos;s militant allies while they are in process. Moreover, Netanyahu is under American pressure to make concessions after his successful wrecking of Obama&apos;s attempt to reinvigorate the Palestinian peace process. Having forced the White House to back down on the West Bank settlement freeze, Bibi might see opening the Syrian track as a way of appeasing an Obama administration keen for results in the Middle East. Though the details of the recent Netanyahu-Obama meeting were not disclosed, the fact that the Syria issue was raised almost immediately afterwards in Paris would prompt speculation that Washington approved it. Ostensibly Syria is not under the same pressure, reflected by Assad&apos;s stated preference of slow indirect talks as opposed to Netanyahu&apos;s proposed face-to-face negotiations. The Syrian president is in a position of comparative strength, having successfully returned from the diplomatic isolation imposed by the Bush White House. A new alliance with Turkey has been forged, strained relations with Saudi Arabia eased and ties with Sarkozy&apos;s France strengthened, all while maintaining its links with Iran. Furthermore, the recent formation of a government in Lebanon after months of deliberation has secured Damascus&apos;s allies in key roles and cemented its privileged position in Beirut. Yet beneath the diplomatic successes lie economic headaches for Assad. Years of drought have crippled Syria&apos;s vital agricultural sector and oil supplies continue to diminish. The economy is struggling to adapt to recent free trade agreements with Arab states and Turkey, prompting some to wonder if this is the real reason for delays in ratifying an association agreement with the EU. While some analysts relish Syria&apos;s opening up to the global market, Damascus fears the US sanctions still in place after the Bush years may stifle foreign investment. Even if negotiations with Israel fail, Assad must be banking on the goodwill capital they could generate to persuade Washington to ease these restrictions. While in Paris, Assad called for greater engagement from the US, specifically citing the sanctions as an obstacle to peace. Opening negotiations is therefore an end unto itself for both leaders, even if neither has any intent to make real concessions. If Netanyahu turns to the Syrian track it will be more a consequence of failures with the Palestinians than a genuine desire to move forward with Damascus, as highlighted by his immediate denial that talks might involve returning the Golan. Netanyahu has perfected the art of procrastination and distraction and will happily accept plaudits for sitting down with the Syrians while openly defying Obama by expanding settlements in the West Bank. Assad, in the meantime, knowing his population would never accept a separate peace that sells out the Palestinians, would hope for economic benefits just for beginning negotiations even if they were ultimately doomed in this form. There is a danger, though, that France, the US and the international community will allow the reopening of the Syria track to distract them. But after the abysmal failure to apply real pressure on Israel over negotiations with the Palestinians, is another bilateral distraction really better than an engaged drive for a comprehensive peace?", "publicationDate": "2009-11-24T16:00:00Z", "title": "Netanyahu's Syrian distraction | Chris Phillips", "sentences": ["Though both leaders were quick to play down any talk of detente, recent announcements in both Tel Aviv and Damascus suggest that talks &quot;without preconditions&quot; may not be far off."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/24/netanyahu-france-talks-syria-israel"}, {"tags": ["easyJet", "Holocaust", "Magazines", "Travel", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "World news", "UK news", "Business", "Media", "Germany", "Europe"], "article": "The budget airline easyJet has been forced to withdraw almost 300,000 copies of its in-flight magazine because of protests over its use of Holocaust memorial sites as a backdrop for a fashion feature. An eight-page spread in the November edition of the magazine, easyJet Traveller, depicted models posing at the Jewish Museum in Berlin and leaning against the pillars of the Holocaust memorial. The magazine has been removed from all flights after complaints from Jewish organisations in Europe and from passengers, particularly on flights to Tel Aviv, one of the airline&apos;s destinations. An advertising agency contracted to produce the feature for easyJet received written permission to photograph its models outside the museum but not at the Holocaust memorial, a field of 2,700 concrete pillars with an underground information hub in the centre of the city. Uwe Neum\u00e4rer, a spokesman for the Foundation for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, said: &quot;We only give permission to projects that have a connection to the memorial, the Holocaust or some aspect of commemoration.&quot; Samantha Day, an easyJet spokeswoman, said the magazine&apos;s contents had been brought to the airline&apos;s attention on Friday, three weeks after it had first gone into circulation. The magazine was produced by an external agency. &quot;We realised that to hold a fashion shoot in front of the memorial was inappropriate and insensitive, and we didn&apos;t wish to offend anyone. It&apos;s not quite clear why we didn&apos;t spot it earlier,&quot; she said. The airline had received a very few complaints about the magazine, &quot;but it can take a few days for customer service complaints to come through and for them to be addressed&quot;. In the publication&apos;s fashion feature, models pose in Berlin fashion designers&apos; outfits and the specific locations are clearly identified in the text. Under the headline A Quick Guide to the Chic Side of Berlin, an accompanying article reads: &quot;Ravaged by war and torn in two by conflicting ideologies, Berlin may not be a picture-perfect jewel \u2026 but it&apos;s a treasure trove for the culture vulture \u2026 no visit would be complete without exploring the testaments to the city&apos;s turbulent past, such as \u2026 the Jewish Museum and the Holocaust memorial.&quot; INK, the publishing house responsible for the magazine, said the article was meant to encourage people to visit the memorial. &quot;The shoot was intended to not only promote local design talent \u2026 but to raise awareness. From an educational perspective, it is of utmost importance that visitors to Berlin see the Jewish Museum \u2026 and Holocaust memorial,&quot; it said in a written statement. Oliver Bloom, an artist from London, had written to the magazine&apos;s editor to complain after seeing the article during a flight between Venice and Gatwick this month. &quot;As soon as I saw the images and recognised where they&apos;d been shot, I just realised what a contradiction it was,&quot; he said. &quot;The memorial is designed as a place to make you feel quite strange, full of monoliths, tombstones, and it&apos;s to help you meditate on the human life lost. To have a fashion shoot there with models, is a contradiction in terms, and shows complete insensitivity and a level of ignorance about the Holocaust.&quot; Bloom also contacted the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. &quot;I told them how distasteful I thought it was. I&apos;m still waiting for a reply from the editor.&quot; easyJet said it &quot;profusely&quot; apologised to anyone offended by the &quot;inappropriate fashion photo shoot \u2026 featured in this month&apos;s issue of the in-flight magazine&quot;, and said it was reviewing its co-operation with INK. One person responding to the issue on the German news website thelocal.de wrote: &quot;What next?

We could give you a couple of suggestions - maybe Siberia in winter? It would be pretty cold for a half-naked model. Or what about the jungles of South America? We can imagine the crew having to contend with &apos;I&apos;m a Celeb&apos;-style issues like huge bugs, unpredictable weather and marauding monkeys. There are many areas of the world where fashion shoots would be problematic: few, however, would have predicted that Berlin could be one of them. We were shocked to read in the Jewish Chronicle this week that easyJet had come under fire for shooting a fashion spread there. Of course, it could be something to do with the fact that they shot it at Berlin&apos;s HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL. In case you didn&apos;t get that the first time, here it is again ... They shot it at Berlin&apos;s HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL. What next? Dancing on the ashes at Auschwitz? Posing sexily next to the skull-filled edifice at the Killing Fields of Cambodia?  Hmmm. The shoot appeared in a magazine published by the budget airline and featured pictures of male and female models posing among the concrete blocks which make up the memorial.  The magazine has now been pulled and easyJet has apologised after complaints from Jewish organisations in Europe and from passengers, particularly on flights to Tel Aviv. Apparently the advertising agency contracted by the in-flight magazine had permission to shoot outside the Holocaust museum, but not within the memorial itself.\u00a0 To us, it just seems incredible that at no point did anyone involved stop and think, hey, what we&apos;re doing is really, really distasteful and offensive. BANG ON TREND     Get your frock on. Photograph: Corbis    Party dresses Irritatingly, party season is just about to begin. Yes, another month of living with mulled wine hangovers and a subsistence diet of dried fruit in pudding form. What&apos;s not to like? You&apos;ll be wanting a new frock to wow all those friends and family you&apos;ve not seen for the whole year (because you don&apos;t really like them all that much), and that&apos;s where we come in ... Let&apos;s make a start with the Scrooge options. We like House of Fraser&apos;s gold dress - it has transparent panels which is very next season, is made from silk and, even better, has been reduced from \u00a3125 to \u00a337.50.  Here at Fashion Statement Towers, we like things understated - this purple tulip dress from Urban Outfitters has a gorgeous sweetheart neckline, isn&apos;t ridiculously short (although it is above the knee) and costs \u00a345.  We love the bold graphic print on Warehouse&apos;s floral dress (reduced from \u00a345 to \u00a320). Team with thick black tights and patent heels and you&apos;re good to go raving.  If you&apos;re after bold shoulders and long sleeves, look no further than Warehouse&apos;s black tunic dress. It has some stud detailing on the shoulder and costs \u00a335.  If you really want to make an entrance, then consider Dorothy Perkin&apos;s jade sequin dress. It&apos;s guaranteed to turn you into a slinky, foxy minx, and it won&apos;t leave a massive hole in your purse as it comes in at a very reasonable \u00a350.  For the bold and the beautiful we like Tofu&apos;s neon blue dress. The skirt is made from layers of chiffon and is attached to a strapless bodice. Reduced in their sale from \u00a3109 to \u00a344.10, it&apos;s also a bargain.  For those who are mostly spending their Christmas money on themselves, there are more expensive options. This two-tone panelled dress by Alessandro Dell&apos;acqua is gorgeous and ticks both the lace box and the &apos;neutral colourways&apos; one too. It&apos;s been reduced from \u00a3370 to \u00a3190.  Whistles&apos; feather dress costs \u00a3295 and is covered with dove grey feathery flappy bits. These create an amazing texture and movement to the fabric -we&apos;re quite impressed.  Finally, your &apos;blow the budget&apos; option is Vivienne Westwood&apos;s Red Label gold halterneck dress at \u00a3543. It has ruching around the cowl neck and on the hip, and is stunning.  FASHIONISTA OF THE WEEK     Cate Blanchett - she played the Queen once. Photograph: Jason Kempin/Getty Images    Cate Blanchett We do love a bit of royal purple at Fashion Statement&apos;s grotto of fun, and Cate Blanchett wears it so well here. All she needs is a sleeve or two and an ermine trim and we could mistake her for the Queen of Merrie England. The one-shouldered dress is by Armani Priv\u00e9 from their Spring 2009 collection. The shoulder in question is padded, which could look really weird, but somehow doesn&apos;t. The dress is embellished with a curtain pull at the hip.

A difficult question to answer when faced with a picture like this - so difficult, in fact, that we are forced to tackle these ladies one at a time. First let&apos;s take Kidman. We&apos;ve always found her mildly disturbing, and not just because she was married to Tom Cruise. It&apos;s something to do with the fact that we suspect she&apos;s actually a robot doing a bad impersonation of being human. HER FACE DOESN&apos;T CHANGE! And she&apos;s strangely ageless. In fact, while typing we&apos;re worried that she might come to life on our computer screen, lean out in 3D, and try to strangle us like something out of The Terminator.  In terms of what she&apos;s wearing, she&apos;s gone for a nude colour which is close to her skin tone, but not quite close enough - or far away enough - to work. Then there are those diagonal strips of lacy scales, which make her look a little like a snake shedding its skin. On to Hudson. We love her happy-go-lucky personality, but she&apos;s playing loose and fast with that dress. Or at least she would be if she weren&apos;t suffering from a case of The Mysterious Missing Nipples.  QUOTE OF THE WEEK  In fashion, once you&apos;ve got something, you&apos;re already thinking about what&apos;s next. Maybe it&apos;s a little hysterical. Now, every day I&apos;m thinking about change. It&apos;s a constant anxiety that is probably a reflection of society&apos;s anxiety in general. The big deal about fashion is really very recent, this frantic pursuit of newness. It may be a good thing, or a bad thing, but it&apos;s really defining this moment.

According to their logic, it should be possible to seamlessly suture together the two parts without raising eyebrows either at home or abroad, regardless of the contravention of both international law and basic morality that such actions entail. All that is required is a healthy dose of chutzpah, combined with a drip-drip effect in which a steady stream of expropriating activities are undertaken at a slow but relentless pace, in the hope that insufficient feathers are ruffled to put a halt to the overarching campaign of annexation. The Jerusalem light railway is a case in point: in isolation, few Israelis would be too perturbed by the idea of providing a rail link between the city centre and outlying towns and suburbs on the periphery of the capital. However, in doing so, the authorities are simultaneously declaring their view that settlements such as French Hill and Pisgat Ze&apos;ev are integral parts of Jerusalem and banging yet another nail into the coffin of a viable Palestinian state. Under the guise of a desire to ease traffic congestion on Jerusalem&apos;s streets, the project bears all the hallmarks of previous efforts to stake a permanent and intractable claim to areas that once might have been considered as appropriate territory to concede as part of a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. As the Alternative Information Centre notes, &quot;by providing direct access to [these locations], the main illegal settlements will finally be linked with the centre and western part of the City. The adverse effects of this will serve to diminish any chance of East Jerusalem becoming the future capital of a Palestinian state under a two-state solution&quot;. Palestinian officials this week issued a call for overseas assistance in preventing the completion of the rail link, having recognised that without such external pressure there is no hope of putting a halt to the illegal construction. Basing their opposition on statutes that deem such building work a violation of international law, the Palestinian Authority urged all Arab countries to end their links with companies associated with the light railway \u2013 including French conglomerates Veolia and Alstom \u2013 in the hope that such a stance would encourage the corporations involved to pull out of the project. The Palestinians know full well that the rail link&apos;s presence will further ingrain in Israelis&apos; minds the idea that every affected township over the Green Line is to be viewed simply as a benign part of Greater Jerusalem, rather than a malignant settlement that threatens the security of both Israelis and Palestinians in the long term. To confirm their fears, they need only look as far as Gilo or Har Homa, both areas built over the Green Line outside Jerusalem&apos;s original city limits, but now treated as no more contentious than Rehavia or the German Colony when it comes to Israel&apos;s continued construction there. Last week&apos;s international criticism of plans to build a further 900 homes in Gilo raised hackles among the Israeli public. Many Israelis have become so accustomed to the idea that Gilo is part of Israel proper that they cannot for the life of them understand why anyone should deny them the right to construct houses there at will. Such a mind-set did not develop overnight; rather, it took years of patient joining of the dots by successive Israeli governments \u2013 by way of transport links, forging social ties between Gilo and other parts of Jerusalem, and so on \u2013 to convince Israelis that Gilo had come in from the cold and was now Jerusalem through and through. When my army unit was based in Har Gilo (a suburb of Gilo even deeper into West Bank territory), none of the residents living alongside our headquarters saw themselves as settlers. Those to whom we spoke thought of themselves as simply Jerusalemites with no more reason to feel guilty about the location of their homes than those dwelling in Tel Aviv or Haifa. The fact that their houses were a stone&apos;s throw from Palestinian towns such as Bet-Jalla did little to change their minds: the Israeli government had thrown a comforting arm around their shoulders and told them all was well, and that was what mattered. But all is not well \u2013 whether in terms of Israel&apos;s relationship with the outside world, the spectre looming of a third Palestinian intifada, or the fact that Israelis are unquestioningly becoming more and more used to their collective status as perpetual oppressors of another people \u2013 and time is not on the peace camp&apos;s side. The light railway and the construction plans for Gilo are not deal-breakers on their own, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts when it comes to the annexation of the West Bank, and all interested parties should be doing their utmost to oppose anything that further cements an Israeli presence in the area. To sit back and do nothing is to be complicit with the insidious plans of those who seek never to accommodate Palestinian needs in terms of their statehood. Israelis, Palestinians and outsiders alike must continue to stand up to the occupation machine&apos;s operators, before the rot sets in completely and for ever. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2009-11-26T15:00:01Z", "title": "Israel's occupation, linked by rail | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Those to whom we spoke thought of themselves as simply Jerusalemites with no more reason to feel guilty about the location of their homes than those dwelling in Tel Aviv or Haifa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/26/israel-occupation-jerusalem-light-railway"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Israel", "US foreign policy", "Turkey", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Little has changed in the ruined city of Quneitra, former capital of the Syrian Golan Heights, since Israeli forces withdrew behind the barbed wire and minefields of the nearby ceasefire line in 1974. A forlorn mosque crumbles slowly into the long grass; a Greek Orthodox church visited by Pope John Paul during his 2001 tour of the Holy Land lies silent, empty and abandoned. Here a ruined school; there a gutted hospital or flattened home. All around is frozen devastation. The Syrian authorities have made no attempt to rebuild here. Until Israel vacates the two-thirds of the Golan Heights it first seized in 1967 and annexed in 1981, as Syria insists it must, they prefer symbolism to salvage. &quot;This is a human tragedy,&quot; said Mohammad Ali, a senior official in Syria&apos;s Golan governorate of which Quneitra forms a part. &quot;There are over 400,000 Syrians from the Golan who live as expellees. &quot;We want a just, comprehensive and lasting peace based on international resolutions. Israel always puts up obstacles ... Israel always blocks negotiations and now they have been stopped again [after Israel&apos;s incursion into Gaza last winter]. But we will retrieve our soil. All occupations come to an end.&quot; Compared to some other aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Israel-Syria &quot;track&quot;, as it is called, is in theory relatively straightforward. President Bashar al-Assad, like his late father, Hafez, wants a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for ending the state of war that currently exists. Implicit in such a deal is Syrian recognition of Israel, mutual security guarantees and normalisation of relations. Talks mediated by Turkey last year raised hopes of a deal. But Israel&apos;s attack on Hamas in Gaza caused Syria to pull out while Turkey, shedding its neutral pose, angrily condemned Tel Aviv&apos;s actions. The rift with Ankara remains unrepaired. Barack Obama&apos;s willingness to engage with Syria after the ostracism of the Bush years also raised expectations that another &quot;Damascus spring&quot; was in the offing. Earlier this year he moved to ease sanctions, promised to send a US ambassador back to Damascus and dispatched his Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, for talks. But Syrian officials have complained in recent weeks that Obama&apos;s words are not matched by actions \u2013 and that a rare opportunity may be missed. The deputy prime minister, Abdullah Dardari, warned that Washington&apos;s apparent disinclination to normalise relations had raised doubts about the &quot;seriousness&quot; of Obama&apos;s commitment to peacemaking. Speaking in Paris during talks with the president, Nicolas Sarkozy, Assad was similarly critical. So far, talks with US officials had not got beyond &quot;an exchange of views&quot;, he said. &quot;The weak point is the American sponsor [of peace talks]. What Obama said about peace was a good thing. We agree with him on the principles. But what&apos;s the action plan? The sponsor has to draw up an action plan.&quot; Syria&apos;s overall positive response to French and EU attempts to improve ties is one of several factors that has encouraged a belief that Assad&apos;s strategic calculus may be shifting. A recent rapprochement with Saudi Arabia, including a visit to Damascus by King Abdullah, has been matched by the signing of a range of bilateral co-operation agreements with Nato member Turkey, a country with which Syria almost went to war a decade ago. Relations with Riyadh plummeted after Syria was accused of ordering the 2005 assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister and close Saudi ally, Rafiq al-Hariri. But like the Americans, the Saudis see a resurgent Iran, not Israel, as the primary regional threat. By repairing ties, they hope to break, or at least temper, Syria&apos;s links with Tehran. Mitchell has said again that the US wants to advance the Syrian track. But concerns about Syria&apos;s role in Iraq, its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and for Palestinian rejectionist groups, its human rights record, its suspicious nuclear activities and its continuing alliance with Tehran have increased domestic political pressure on Obama to exercise caution in reaching out to Damascus \u2013 even though by doing so, he might achieve the regional peace breakthrough he so craves. And crucially, perhaps, Obama&apos;s Syrian overtures have received scant encouragement from Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s hawkish prime minister. He says Israel will never retreat from the 1974 line. &quot;The Golan will never be divided again, the Golan will never fall again, the Golan will remain in our hands,&quot; he said in February. Israeli commentators speculate that Netanyahu, rather than contemplating peace, is preparing for war in the spring against Iran and Hezbollah. That would once again place Syria, and the devastated city of Quneitra, squarely in the firing line. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-27T00:05:12Z", "title": "The Golan Heights' long wait | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["But Israel&apos;s attack on Hamas in Gaza caused Syria to pull out while Turkey, shedding its neutral pose, angrily condemned Tel Aviv&apos;s actions."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/27/golan-heights-syria-us"}, {"tags": ["Scottish Premiership", "Celtic", "Sport", "Football", "Scottish Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "5 November 2006. The latest indication that Paul Le Guen&apos;s tenure at Rangers is to prove ill-fated arrives at Tannadice as his team squanders a one-goal lead. Two headers from set plays, late in the game, secure three points for Dundee United. A month later, Le Guen cuts a lonely figure on the touchline at Falkirk as the hosts earn a 1-0 win. In between times St Johnstone, of the First Division, had bounced Rangers out of the League Cup. Tony Mowbray&apos;s time at Celtic remains short of the Rangers Le Guen experiment, which ultimately proved as brief as it was disastrous. Yet that has not stopped people making comparisons, especially on account of Celtic&apos;s capitulation at Tannadice on Sunday. One goal ahead with seven minutes to play, a basic inability to defend two straightforward set pieces prompted another defeat for Mowbray&apos;s men. The statistic of just two wins in 10 matches \u2013 those successes coming against the struggling Kilmarnock and Hamilton \u2013 is impossible for the manager to ignore despite his reluctance to &quot;draw a blanket&quot; over those games. Falkirk, at that point without a league win all season, exposed the frailties in Mowbray&apos;s defence by scoring three times against them a fortnight ago. Even at this, a formative stage in Mowbray&apos;s time at Celtic, he faces a crucial week. St Mirren&apos;s visit to Parkhead tomorrow is followed by a Europa League clash with free-scoring Hapoel Tel Aviv and a meeting with Aberdeen. The Dons, of course, are currently under the guidance of Mark McGhee, a man who was some people&apos;s choice to get the Celtic post ahead of Mowbray. If nothing else, McGhee will arrive back in Glasgow with something to prove. With Rangers a point clear of Celtic at the summit of the Scottish Premier League and with a game in hand, maximum points against St Mirren and Aberdeen are necessary. Given the relative weakness of the opposition, they should also be reasonably easily attainable. Thankfully for all concerned, there have not been many recent European occasions at Celtic Park which are, in essence, dead rubbers but the Hapoel encounter, miracles aside, is just that. Two points will be pertinent; how many supporters turn out for the meeting with the Israelis and, in turn, to what extent Mowbray&apos;s players look capable of or willing to put on a show. Already, the manager has frequently contradicted himself when discussing whether it is results or performances which matter more at Celtic. He has not known this level of intense scrutiny before. The Le Guen/Mowbray comparison is on one hand intriguing, on another seemingly well wide of the mark. Both are idealists, set in their ways over playing style and not particularly of a mind to engage others who suggest it may not fit the environment they find themselves in. There is nothing ideal, however, about a blunt failure to defend free-kicks and corners as Mowbray is continually finding to his cost. In any amateur game on a Sunday morning, defenders would be in danger of having their teeth smashed out by irate team-mates if they showed the scandalous generosity displayed by Gary Caldwell and Glenn Loovens on Sunday. The respective teams of Le Guen and Mowbray have one thing in common; they are too soft. Mentally, that is, as well as physically. Gordon Strachan&apos;s Celtic instantly made such a habit, after all, of doing to other SPL teams by virtue of late goal after late goal what United did to Mowbray&apos;s men on Sunday. But while Le Guen spent the summer of 2006 overhauling Rangers with a new playing style and imports who, it was briskly clear, were not good or physically imposing enough \u2013 Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Filip Sebo to name but three \u2013 Mowbray&apos;s team essentially remains that of Strachan. The former West Bromwich Albion manager has added only Landry N&apos;Gu\u00e9mo, Danny Fox and Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 to the first team. Onlookers remain unconvinced N&apos;Guemo is any better than Paul Hartley or, as Sunday proved, Morgaro Gomis. Fox, bizarrely catapulted into the Scotland team after a dozen reasonable games in green and white, lacks defensive awareness and may not be superior to Lee Naylor. Fortun\u00e9, meanwhile, represents Mowbray&apos;s most pressing problem. A \u00a33.8m transfer fee in today&apos;s Scottish football climate means Celtic&apos;s support are entitled to be exasperated by the misfiring French striker, his only excuse that he missed a chunk of the early season through injury. The fact Mowbray&apos;s team represents a work in progress is both an advantage and a potential vexing point for the manager. It will take at least two transfer windows until he can legitimately put his own stamp on the playing staff but, if new recruits such as Fortun\u00e9 continue to toil, why would the Celtic board back their manager with meaningful transfer funds? This is not the worst Celtic team ever, contrary to phone-in theory. Between 1958 and 1965, they did not win a trophy at all. There were similar barren years between 1989 and 1995. Even in recent times, the Celtic side of John Barnes were a shambles; a criticism which could not reasonably levelled at Mowbray&apos;s team, still a point from the top of the SPL. Peter Lawwell and the Celtic board are not trigger-happy. It would be a major shock if Mowbray&apos;s reign is anything like as short as Le Guen&apos;s. Nonetheless, unless the early season afflictions which have haunted Celtic are swiftly remedied, their manager&apos;s long-term plans will be undermined by short-term trauma.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-27T12:05:42Z", "title": "Patience runs thin at Parkhead as Tony Mowbray's Celtic project stalls | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["St Mirren&apos;s visit to Parkhead tomorrow is followed by a Europa League clash with free-scoring Hapoel Tel Aviv and a meeting with Aberdeen."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/nov/27/tony-mowbray-celtic-paul-le-guen"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Fatah", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "From the tree-ringed campus of Birzeit University, a narrow road leads deep inside the rocky valleys of the West Bank to the small, unexceptional Palestinian village of Kobar. It is home to a few thousand people, dotted with a handful of schools and mosques. At one whitewashed house, off the main road at the entrance to the village, there is a carefully tended garden, with stone walls, a small lawn, bougainvillea and citrus trees. Here Atif Barghouti sat in the winter sunshine trying to make sense of the wash of rumours that suggested his younger brother, Kobar&apos;s most famous son, might be on the verge of release from jail, a release that might just revitalise the fractured and demoralised Palestinian national movement. For now his brother, Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinians&apos; most popular potential leader, sits several miles to the west, a resident of cell number 28 in Block Three of Israel&apos;s Haderim prison, where he is serving five life sentences for five counts of murder. In the past week there has been an apparent burst of progress in the protracted negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist movement, Hamas, over a vast prisoner swap. Under the developing deal, mediated by German intelligence officers, Hamas would hand over Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured near Gaza in June 2006, in return for the release of perhaps 1,000 Palestinians from Israeli jails. Several senior Palestinian officials say Barghouti&apos;s name is top of the list of those to be released. If the deal goes ahead, it would be Israel&apos;s biggest prisoner swap in more than 20 years. The freeing of Barghouti could also be a watershed in the history of the Middle East conflict. Atif Barghouti, 60, said that there were &quot;encouraging signs&quot; and he was &quot;optimistic&quot;, but that he had heard such rumours many times before. The village itself shows no sign yet of a welcome party, save the odd line of graffiti sprayed on the walls referring to Barghouti by his nickname: &quot;We will never forget you, Abu Qassam.&quot; Barghouti is sometimes described by outsiders as a Nelson Mandela for the Palestinians. He doesn&apos;t consider himself so. Once he said of himself: &quot;I am simply a regular guy from the Palestinian street advocating only what every other oppressed person has advocated \u2013 the right to help myself in the absence of help from anywhere else.&quot; &quot;Marwan doesn&apos;t hold a magic wand in his hand,&quot; said his brother. &quot;But he is not a dirty person; his hands were not polluted by corruption or politics. And he is on the Hamas list of prisoners not because of his blue eyes, but because he is a national leader and has proved himself beyond doubt.&quot; One of seven brothers and sisters, he was born into a poor family in a small, old house in the village centre. &quot;Since he was 16 or 17 he possessed a strong personality, a strong will,&quot; said his brother. At 18 he was arrested by the Israeli military for the first time. He was in his early 20s when construction began on Ateret, a Jewish settlement built 10 miles inside the West Bank, overlooking Kobar. The rows of heavily guarded, red-roofed, Swiss-chalet-style homes, all illegal under international law, only underscore the reach of Israel&apos;s occupation and its colonial settler project. Prison delayed Barghouti&apos;s education by several years, but he attended Birzeit University, where he was deeply involved in the Fatah student wing. He was then punished for his role in the first Palestinian uprising, the intifada of 1987, with deportation to Jordan for seven years. He welcomed the Oslo peace accords and met many times with Israeli politicians and peace activists, always campaigning for a two-state peace deal. But until his last arrest he also led the Tanzim, Fatah&apos;s military wing, through the start of the much more deadly second intifada. Beyond his obvious popularity, Barghouti, 50, is important on two counts. First, he is the one Palestinian figure who is most likely to bridge the bitter divide between the rival factions of Hamas and Fatah. In jail in mid-2006 he helped author the Prisoners&apos; Document, outlining a rapprochement between the two factions in which Hamas was finally to adopt Fatah&apos;s long-held support for a two-state peace deal. Second, Barghouti advocates a parallel policy of negotiations with Israel together with &quot;resistance&quot;. Given that the Palestinians have been in negotiations since 1991 and have so far failed to achieve the promise of independence, his more assertive approach resonates deeply with his people. Ten days ago Barghouti wrote to a journalist from his prison cell outlining his position: &quot;Betting on negotiations alone was never our choice. I have always called for a constructive mix of negotiation, resistance, political, diplomatic and popular action.&quot; He now seems to favour civil disobedience and non-violent protests, similar to those held every week against the West Bank barrier, but he also insists on the right to an armed struggle, within the occupied territories and directed against Israeli soldiers and settlers. Barghouti was convicted in May 2004 for his role in three separate attacks that left four Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk dead. The judges said he provided weapons and money for the attacks, but for the most part did not have direct contact with those carrying out the killings. He was also given two consecutive terms of 20 years for a failed car bombing at a shopping centre in Jerusalem and membership of a banned &quot;terror organisation&quot;, Fatah&apos;s al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which was responsible for many suicide bombings. His justification for attacks on Israeli troops and settlers as &quot;legitimate resistance&quot; caused outrage among the Israeli public. In the first attack in June 2001, two Palestinian gunmen ambushed a car in the West Bank, killing the driver, a Greek Orthodox monk who may have been mistaken for a Jewish settler. The second attack was another ambush in January 2002, in which an Israeli driver who had stopped at a petrol station was shot dead near Givat Ze&apos;ev, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. The third attack was in March that year, when a Palestinian armed with grenades, knifes and an assault rifle killed three Israelis eating at a popular Tel Aviv seafood restaurant. Barghouti was acquitted of involvement in 21 other murders. Unlike many other Palestinians, Barghouti was tried, convicted and sentenced in the Tel Aviv district court, not a military court. The case was heavily publicised, with televised broadcasts, and was regarded by Israelis as crucial in breaking the back of the uprising and the wave of killings and bombings it brought with it. That was only five years ago, for some too short a time to overturn his sentence. Arguably the current division between the Palestinian factions works in Israel&apos;s interests and Barghouti&apos;s commitment to draw Fatah and Hamas back together might represent a serious strategic threat. Many in Israel&apos;s intelligence agencies apparently think so. Last week Silvan Shalom, a deputy prime minister, said categorically that Barghouti would not be freed. In August, even Tzipi Livni, the former foreign minister and now head of the centrist opposition Kadima party, spoke out against his release, citing his conviction and sentence. That came just days after Barghouti won, in his absence, election to Fatah&apos;s top central committee. &quot;The fact that the Palestinians elected him or that someone here in Israel thinks that he can be a partner is not a sufficient excuse for his release,&quot; she said. Rami Igra, a former senior officer in Mossad, said any prisoner swap would be &quot;shameless and bottomless surrender&quot; to Hamas. &quot;Imagine the day after: the Hamas government will be crowned in victory and will link up with the extremist leader Barghouti and adopt the idea of Israel&apos;s destruction,&quot; he wrote in the Israel Hayom newspaper last week. Such voices often drown out those of other Israelis who have suggested his release might, on the contrary, herald the long-imagined historic deal that sets the Middle East at peace. The late respected Israeli defence analyst Ze&apos;ev Schiff once described Barghouti as a &quot;charismatic, popular and worthy Palestinian negotiating partner&quot;. Gush Shalom, the Israeli peace movement, placed an advert in Friday&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz that read simply: &quot;Freeing Gilad Shalit is a moral act. Freeing Marwan Barghouti is a wise act.&quot; It was lunchtime on 15 April 2002, at the height of the second intifada, when Israeli special forces tracked Barghouti to the house of a friend in Ramallah. He was eventually arrested, walking out with his hands up, along with his cousin and with the owner of the house, Ziad Abu Ain, a senior Fatah figure and fellow former prisoner who was once deported from the US. Today Abu Ain is a deputy minister in the Palestinian government in the West Bank. He believes the return of Barghouti to active political life could revolutionise the Palestinian struggle. &quot;We will call for a civil intifada, to bring the Palestinians onto the streets saying we will not accept the occupation\u2026 an intifada with no weapons, no stones,&quot; he said. Abu Ain says he sees Barghouti acting alongside Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. &quot;He is a good aide to Abu Mazen, not a replacement for him. Now Palestinian society doesn&apos;t accept just Abu Mazen as a leader. Abu Mazen needs a good tactician like Marwan behind him. Marwan will support him as president, but he will not be a candidate against him.&quot; However, it is by no means certain that the rest of the Palestinian leadership shares this appetite for renewed confrontation. Abbas himself has long argued solely for the path of negotiations, rather than any armed struggle or popular resistance. Many Palestinians now openly say how much they regret the violence of the second intifada, which they believe was mistaken and set their cause back. Even Abu Ain admits mistakes were made. &quot;We gave the OK to resistance by the gun against Israeli troops and settlers. We were against operations inside Israel, but it happened out of our control. We made a big mistake.&quot; Another mistake came after the 11 September attacks when Abbas had counselled the Fatah leadership to recognise the new diplomatic climate and immediately halt violence, but he was ignored. &quot;It was another mistake,&quot; Abu Ain said. &quot;People think in different ways.&quot; It is notable that Barghouti has not pitted himself directly against Abbas as a candidate for future elections. He almost did in 2005, but backed down. This time he and his advisers say that he will not challenge Abbas and will only run if Abbas keeps to his promise to stand down at the next election, whenever that is, although for now the Palestine Liberation Organisation is likely to insist that Abbas stays in power. However, not everyone sees an Abbas-Barghouti partnership emerging as easily as Abu Ain suggests. There are others in the party who might also vie for power, among them Mohammad Dahlan, a former security chief with a strong constituency in Washington, and Nasser al-Qudwa, a former Palestinian representative at the UN. Barghouti himself represents a younger force in the movement, which is eager to replace the ageing leadership. Abbas&apos;s credibility is already weak: after winning the election five years ago on a promise of a negotiated peace deal he has nothing to show for it except yet more Israeli settlement growth. Some believe a major prisoner swap now would so benefit Hamas that it would spell Abbas&apos;s quick political demise. &quot;It will destroy him,&quot; said Hani al-Masri, a respected Palestinian political analyst. &quot;It will show the only people who can release real prisoners are Hamas, while he can&apos;t do anything. He will understand this is a sign by Israel to get rid of him, especially if Marwan Barghouti is released. Imagine if he nominates himself while Abu Mazen is still in power?&quot; One Palestinian opinion poll in August said if Abbas stood as Fatah&apos;s candidate for the Palestinian presidency against Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader and former prime minister, he would win 52% to 38%. However, if it was Barghouti standing against Haniyeh he would win by a far larger margin, 62% to 31%. Such findings are not new and are glaringly obvious to the Palestinian leadership. Barghouti writes frequently from jail. He wrote to a conference on Palestinian prisoners last week and called for a two-state solution, giving a taste of what he might stand for if freed. He advocated a return to his 2006 Prisoners Document as a basis for uniting Hamas and Fatah, which he sees as a priority. He also underlined the need for more &quot;resistance&quot;. &quot;Anyone who is betting that the suffering that the Palestinians have endured will lead it to stop their struggle is wrong,&quot; he wrote. &quot;That is because the Palestinian people, who have led the longest revolution in modern history and the two most significant uprisings any nation has known, has an ever-replenished fountain of resistance. They will defend and continue their legitimate struggle and resistance against the occupation.&quot; All now depends on the secret negotiations over the Shalit prisoner swap, which restart tomorrow after a brief hiatus. Reports suggest there is still disagreement over which prisoners Israel is prepared to free, whether the list can include Barghouti, and what will happen to them once released. Sa&apos;d Nimr, a Fatah official and close aide of Barghouti, insists he has been told by Hamas and by Egypt, which also mediates in negotiations, that no deal will happen without Barghouti&apos;s release. &quot;The deal is going to happen because at the end of the day the Israelis are bound to set their soldier free,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is when, how and who will be freed?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-11-29T00:09:42Z", "title": "Palestine calls for release of intifada leader in prisoner swap with Israel", "sentences": ["The third attack was in March that year, when a Palestinian armed with grenades, knifes and an assault rifle killed three Israelis eating at a popular Tel Aviv seafood restaurant.", "Unlike many other Palestinians, Barghouti was tried, convicted and sentenced in the Tel Aviv district court, not a military court."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/marwan-barghouti-palestine-gilad-shalit"}, {"tags": ["Scottish Premiership", "Rangers", "Champions League", "Celtic", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2009-10"], "article": "If the rules allowed it, Sevilla could face Rangers in the final match of Champions League Group G with a team from the Spanish equivalent of the local Women&apos;s Institute and still be no better than evens to secure victory. It is a measure of the Scottish champions&apos; abysmal performances in Europe&apos;s premier tournament that their visit to the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium on 9\u00a0December should have become an occasion to dread, rather than an opportunity for glory. With no victories and two points from their five outings, Walter Smith&apos;s side reached the nadir last Tuesday night, when, comprehensively outplayed, the margin of their 2-0 defeat at home to VfB Stuttgart could easily have been tripled. The anguish suffered by the club&apos;s followers is deepened by the thought that their &quot;heroes&quot; have finished a distant last in possibly the weakest group in the history of the competition. The top seeds were the third-best team in Spain, while Rangers were placed in the second tier. The German representatives were the third-best side in the Bundesliga, while the fourth seeds, Unirea Urziceni, are a small-town team who astonished Romania by winning the national championship last season. As Sevilla raced to virtual qualification for the knockout phase by the halfway point of the group stage, the other three proved to be so moderate that by the time they had played a dozen matches between them only one victory had been produced, Unirea&apos;s 4-1 triumph at Ibrox. The Romanians&apos; improbable win over a possibly complacent Sevilla in Bucharest last week was further bad news for Rangers, meaning the Spaniards need to win the last match to ensure they reap the benefits of finishing top of the group. But, if Rangers&apos; endeavours in the Champions League have been undistinguished, Celtic&apos;s in the Europa League have been worse. They have been competing in the less exacting tournament, even allowing for the mediocrity of Rangers&apos; opponents. Like Smith&apos;s side, Tony Mowbray&apos;s has won a paltry two points and scored two goals and, although Rangers have been ejected from Europe first, it is merely because of the order of play. Celtic seem very likely to follow them as early as Thursday, when they host the Group C leaders, Hapoel Tel Aviv. Celtic will find it difficult enough to secure the two victories from their remaining matches that is the minimum they require to have a chance of survival; the really difficult part will be to induce Hamburg SV to lose both of their games. A draw for the Germans at home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday will confirm the Scots&apos; exit. Curiously, when Celtic lost 2-1 to Hapoel in the opening match in Israel after outplaying and leading the home team, the defeat was regarded by their supporters as a scandal. Hapoel have since beaten Rapid home and away to top the group, while Celtic have, by and large, vindicated their followers&apos; early misgivings about their mental fortitude. The latest capitulation, the 2-1 defeat by Dundee United last Sunday after they had led with seven minutes to go, left them trailing Rangers in the SPL \u2013 the latter also having a match in hand \u2013 and intensified the clamour for Mowbray&apos;s removal after a few months in charge. The manager recalled on Friday that he had similar &quot;teething troubles&quot; in his early days in charge of West Bromwich Albion and that they had eventually gone on to win promotion to the Premier League. That argument will be meaningless to a Celtic support whose ambitions include multiple trophies and regular, honourable representation in the Champions League.

That was Maccabi Tel Aviv more than a decade ago and he ultimately steered them to a sixth-place finish. &quot;This time I would be happy to finish in the top 17,&quot; said the Israeli after his first match in charge of Portsmouth concluded in the side&apos;s heaviest home defeat of the season and results elsewhere conspired to leave them seven points from safety. As if their present position is not ominous enough, Portsmouth&apos;s opponents over the next month include Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal, and the following month they will lose six important players to the Africa Cup of Nations and possibly also their key midfielder Jamie O&apos;Hara, whose loan from Tottenham Hotspur must be renegotiated in January. Grant&apos;s predecessor, Paul Hart, may have been unfortunate to be sacked last week, but the Israeli cannot be said to be lucky in terms of the situation he has inherited. The talks he will have this week with the chief executive, Peter Storrie, about reinforcements will go a long way to determining whether there is light at the end of the tunnel, or just more hopeful digging. Grant is optimistic. &quot;We are to have discussions and in the next couple of days and I will know what we can do in January,&quot; said Grant. &quot;We have a good squad but there are positions where we could make it stronger and I think we will do it.&quot;   &nbsp;by&nbsp;Guardian Chalkboards   The visit of Manchester United will have helped highlight the positions where Portsmouth could do with strengthening. A striker who does not panic at the briefest sight of goal would surely be welcome \u2013 Aruna Dindane may have hit a hat-trick against Wigan last month but that is the only time this season that he has worn the guise of a deadly predator and against United, though his speed and movement constituted a constant menace, his shooting was a danger only to spectators. Once he was thwarted by goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak but on three other occasions he spared United with rash and wonky finishes. The Ivorian was the most persistent offender, but by no means the only one: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne and Kevin-Prince Boateng also missed clear opportunities, while Kuszczak deserved the credit for two further outstanding saves, from Boateng and O&apos;Hara in either half. &quot;I don&apos;t think even the big teams have created as many chances against United as we did,&quot; said Grant. &quot;Even Sir Alex said to me afterwards that we played well and he was very happy with his goalkeeper. But I know that if you don&apos;t score, you&apos;d better not give goals away.&quot; Alas, Pompey did give goals away. If hastiness in front of goal was a problem, sluggishness sunk them at the other end. Wayne Rooney converted two penalties after lazy, needless fouls, and his only goal from open play came after he was teed up by Ryan Giggs, whose run from midfield had gone undetected by the entire Portsmouth defence. &quot;We always play well but silly mistakes cost us,&quot; said Boateng. &quot;Man United weren&apos;t better than us but every week we&apos;re coming off the pitch having lost.&quot; That should not be interpreted as defeatism. Indeed, no individual performance encapsulated better than Boateng&apos;s the reasons why hope is not dead at Fratton Park. The 22-year-old could easily have settled for an inconspicuous role after his misadventure at Stoke last week, when his penalty miss was a major factor in Portsmouth&apos;s loss and, therefore, in the decision to sack Hart. But here he was at the hub of everything that Portsmouth did well, his inventive probing and determined running frequently forcing United on to the back foot, particularly in the first half, when Rooney was often left isolated up front because United&apos;s trio of supposed offensive midfielders, Giggs, Paul Scholes and Antonio Valencia, were all helping out at the back. &quot;The spirit of the team was very good,&quot; said Grant. &quot;We believe we can survive. It will not be easy, it will be a long, long battle. But it is possible.&quot; United, of course, remain full of hope. Sir Alex Ferguson insisted that the title race is very much open, regardless of yesterday&apos;s result between Arsenal and Chelsea. &quot;It&apos;s not as simple as people think that Chelsea are steaming away with the league and they have got a healthy lead,&quot; said Ferguson ahead of that game. &quot;Yes, you hope Arsenal take something from the game, if it&apos;s a draw both drop two points and if Chelsea win they continue and we continue to chase them.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-11-30T00:10:01Z", "title": "Avram Grant seeking reinforcements after hammering by Manchester United", "sentences": ["That was Maccabi Tel Aviv more than a decade ago and he ultimately steered them to a sixth-place finish."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/30/portsmouth-manchester-united-match-report"}, {"tags": ["Celtic", "Europa League", "Hapoel Tel Aviv", "Scottish Premiership", "Football", "Sport", "Scottish Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "  Tony Mowbray has given the latest indication that he will seek rapidly to overhaul the Celtic squad he largely inherited from his predecessor as manager, Gordon Strachan, having already questioned the quality of the players.

The veteran Rangers manager and Europe&apos;s premier tournament have long been uneasy bedfellows; Smith&apos;s reputation, built on domination of the domestic game during his first tour of duty at Ibrox in the 90s, would be consistently undermined by failures in the continental theatre. Not much has changed since his return. Having qualified for the 2007-08 tournament after finishing runners-up in the SPL, Rangers took third place in a group that included Barcelona and Lyon, and went on to reach the final of the Uefa Cup in Manchester. That was followed, however, by the humiliating elimination at the qualifying stage last season by FBK Kaunas of Lithuania and this term&apos;s three home defeats, which have left them bottom of Group G with two points from five outings. The visit to Sevilla for Wednesday&apos;s final match will not improve their position, but it does offer Smith an opportunity to confirm his theory that he is more culpable than anyone for the recent embarrassments. &quot;If you look at our performances and results, you&apos;ll see a pattern that tells you a lot about how we went about this campaign,&quot; Smith says. &quot;I changed the way we would normally play in Europe and, on reflection, it was the wrong thing to do. I should have stuck to what we did before, the thing we were good at. &quot;When we went all the way to the Uefa Cup final, it was because we were very hard to beat. We played with more defensive players in wider areas and it meant we could be solid and still break forward when the opportunity arose. But, once you&apos;ve done that, it&apos;s a natural progression to want to play with a little more flair and creativity. &quot;The problem with that was that we used more forward types of players in wide positions. They were less defensive and it loosened us up, especially at home. When Sevilla came to Ibrox and discovered we could be vulnerable in those areas, they had the players to take full advantage. Unfortunately, we were also very vulnerable at home to Unirea and Stuttgart and lost all our home games. &quot;That&apos;s really the galling aspect because we&apos;ve drawn our two away games, in Romania and Germany, and were actually unlucky not to win at least one of them. But, overall, we proved not to be resilient enough to cope with the Champions League this time. I take full responsibility for how we went about it.&quot; Rangers&apos; and Celtic&apos;s impoverished performances in Europe this season \u2013 the Parkhead side having finally won a match at the seventh attempt with Wednesday&apos;s 2-0 Europa League victory over Hapoel Tel Aviv in Glasgow \u2013 strikes Smith as an indicator of forthcoming difficulties for Scotland&apos;s representatives in the big tournaments. &quot;Looking further down the line,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s going to become even harder, not just for Scottish sides, but for teams from a whole raft of countries. &quot;The way qualifying for the Champions League has been restructured, it&apos;s going to be even more difficult to qualify, as we saw with Celtic having to play Arsenal this season. Uefa have to give some thought to a scheme that will help big clubs in the smaller countries, such as the Old Firm and those in, say, Portugal and Holland. If it&apos;s a European league that also gives access to the Champions League and the Europa League, just like a domestic championship, then fine. &quot;I don&apos;t have details worked out, I just have the thought that something will have to give. Uefa say they are trying to avoid elitism, but they&apos;ve already created it by allowing so many big clubs from the wealthier nations in.

Even supposedly neutral news reporters regularly repeat this sad tale. &quot;Very little is changing for the Palestinian people on the ground,&quot; I heard BBC World Service Cairo correspondent Christian Fraser tell listeners three times in a 45-minute period the other evening. In fact nothing could be further from the truth. I had spent that day in the West Bank&apos;s largest city, Nablus. The city is bursting with energy, life and signs of prosperity, in a way I have not previously seen in many years of covering the region. As I sat in the plush office of Ahmad Aweidah, the suave British-educated banker who heads the Palestinian Securities Exchange, he told me that the Nablus stock market was the second best-performing in the world so far in 2009, after Shanghai. (Aweidah&apos;s office looks directly across from the palatial residence of Palestinian billionaire Munib al-Masri, the wealthiest man in the West Bank.) Later I met Bashir al-Shakah, director of Nablus&apos;s gleaming new cinema, where four of the latest Hollywood hits were playing that day. Most movies were sold out, he noted, proudly adding that the venue had already hosted a film festival since it opened in June. Wandering around downtown Nablus the shops and restaurants I saw were full. There were plenty of expensive cars on the streets. Indeed I counted considerably more BMWs and Mercedes than I&apos;ve seen, for example, in downtown Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. And perhaps most importantly of all, we had driven from Jerusalem to Nablus without going through any Israeli checkpoints. The government of Binyamin Netanyahu has removed them all since the Israeli security services (with the encouragement and support of President George Bush) were allowed, over recent years, to crush the intifada, restore security to the West Bank and set up the conditions for the economic boom that is now occurring. (There was one border post on the return leg of the journey, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, but the young female guard just waved me and the two Palestinians I was travelling with, through.) The shops and restaurants were also full when I visited Hebron recently, and I was surprised to see villas comparable in size to those on the Cote d&apos;Azur or Bel Air had sprung up on the hills around the city. Life is even better in Ramallah, where it is difficult to get a table in a good restaurant. New apartment buildings, banks, brokerage firms, luxury car dealerships and health clubs are to be seen. In Qalqilya, another West Bank city that was previously a hotbed of terrorists and bomb-makers, the first-ever strawberry crop is being harvested in time to cash in on the lucrative Christmas markets in Europe. Local Palestinian farmers have been trained by Israeli agriculture experts and Israel supplied them with irrigation equipment and pesticides. A new Palestinian city, Ruwabi, is to be built soon north of Ramallah. Last month, the Jewish National Fund, an Israeli charity, helped plant 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area the Palestinian planners say they would like to develop on the edge of the new city. Israeli experts are also helping the Palestinians plan public parks and other civic amenities. Outsiders are beginning to take note of the turnaround too. The official PLO Wafa news agency reported last week that the third quarter of 2009 witnessed near-record tourism in the Palestinian Authority, with 135,939 overnight hotel stays in 89 hotels that are now open. Almost half the guests come from the US or Europe. Palestinian economic growth so far this year \u2013 in a year dominated by economic crisis elsewhere \u2013 has been an impressive 7% according to the IMF, though Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayad, himself a former World Bank and IMF employee, says it is in fact 11%, partly helped along by strong economic performances in neighbouring Israel. In Gaza too, the shops and markets are crammed with food and goods \u2013 see, for example, the photos from the Gaza-based newspaper Palestine Today about the recent Eid celebrations in Gaza. These are not the pictures you are ever likely to see on the BBC or Le Monde or the New York Times. No, Gaza is not like a &quot;concentration camp,&quot; nor is the &quot;humanitarian crisis in Gaza is on the scale of Darfur,&quot; as British journalist Lauren Booth (who is also Tony Blair&apos;s sister-in-law) has said. In June, the Washington Post&apos;s Jackson Diehl related how Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had told him why he had turned down Ehud Olmert&apos;s offer last year to create a Palestinian state on 97% of the West Bank (with 3% of pre-1967 Israeli land being added to make up the shortfall). &quot;In the West Bank we have a good reality,&quot; Abbas told Diehl. &quot;The people are living a normal life,&quot; he added in a rare moment of candour to a western journalist. Nablus stock exchange head Ahmad Aweidah went further in explaining to me why there is no rush to declare statehood, saying ordinary Palestinians need the Israel Defence Forces to help protect them from Hamas, as their own security forces aren&apos;t ready to do so by themselves yet. The truth is that an independent Palestine is now quietly being built, with Israeli assistance. So long as the Obama administration and European politicians don&apos;t clumsily meddle as they have in the past and make unrealistic demands for the process to be completed more quickly than it can be, I am confident the outcome will be a positive one. (The last time an American president \u2013 Bill Clinton in 2000 \u2013 tried to hurry things along unrealistically, it merely resulted in blowing up in everybody&apos;s faces \u2013 literally \u2013 and set back hopes for peace by some years.) Israelis and Palestinians may never agree on borders that will satisfy everyone. But that doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t live in peace. Not all Germans and French agree who should control Alsace-Lorraine. Poles and Russians, Slovenes and Croats, Britons and Irish, and peoples all over the world, have border disputes. But that doesn&apos;t keep them from coexisting with one another. Nor \u2013 so long as partisan journalists and human rights groups don&apos;t mislead western politicians into making bad decisions \u2013 will it prevent Israelis and Palestinians from doing so. \u2022 This article first appeared in the Wall Street Journal Europe \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2009-12-07T14:47:00Z", "title": "Building peace without Obama's interference | Tom Gross", "sentences": ["Indeed I counted considerably more BMWs and Mercedes than I&apos;ve seen, for example, in downtown Jerusalem or Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/dec/07/obama-interference-independent-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Premier League", "Sunderland", "Portsmouth", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "The temperature touched 20 degrees in Tel Aviv today and the sun shone but, on Wearside, the mercury struggled to reach a gloom-shrouded five centigrade. As he shivered in the away dug-out, Avram Grant could be forgiven for wondering if swapping life in his native Israel for a return to Portsmouth had really been such a great exchange. After all, it is not even as if the lack of warmth and UV rays is restricted to the English weather. Bar an odd creative spark supplied by Jamie 0&apos;Hara, bottom-placed Portsmouth played like a team with their brains frozen by fear of yet another defeat and their spirits numbed by the club&apos;s latest financial bulletin. They departed with a most unlikely point garnered courtesy of Younes Kaboul&apos;s opportunism at a stoppage-time corner, but that was more down to an inexcusable concentration short circuit on the part of a Sunderland side who failed to convert a plethora of chances. Several were created by the outstanding Nyron Nosworthy. &quot;Nuggsy&quot; has found first-team opportunities rare of late, but the right-back remains something of a cult hero and the home fans were delighted to see him instigate the opening goal. Daring overlaps were already proving a feature of Nosworthy&apos;s play when one such foray concluded with him playing the ball short to Jordan Henderson. Confronted by Marc Wilson, the teenager nonchalantly nutmegged the Portsmouth defender before crossing to Andy Reid at the far post. Reid&apos;s volleyed centre was then lashed beyond David James courtesy of Darren Bent&apos;s half-volley from eight yards. So poor were Portsmouth that Marton Fulop, Bruce&apos;s goalkeeper, was barely involved before being required to save \u2013 comfortably enough \u2013 O&apos;Hara&apos;s curling free-kick early in the second half. Although Kaboul subsequently unleashed a menacing shot, Sunderland \u2013 for whom Jones, Bent, Henderson and Reid all came close to scoring a second goal \u2013 were coasting. So much so that they turned somewhat slapdash when it came to retaining possession and, worse, failed to defend their near post at O&apos;Hara&apos;s stoppage-time corner. Instead of heading the ball clear, they let it fall for Kaboul to bundle beyond Fulop from close range. No matter that the already booked defender was promptly sent off for removing his shirt, Grant&apos;s life seemed suddenly, if temporarily, suffused with sunshine once more.

The last 10 to 15 minutes we seemed to be inviting them on to us. I would question Bruce&apos;s decision to take our two strikers off. It was a scrappy game between two mediocre teams and really not a good advert for Premier League football. The first half we were fairly comfortable but much weaker later. Nyron Nosworthy was the one bright spot in the game \u2013 he was good entertainment value.

It was a match between two quite poor teams and we were just happy to get the result. In the first half we were playing like strangers but then started passing to each other \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 in the second. You have to have a sense of humour in supporting this team.

Preferring to rely on instinct and emotion, Grant turned a deaf ear. &quot;When I was offered the job, everybody said to me not to take it,&quot; he said after following up the previous weekend&apos;s home win against Burnley with a draw on Wearside. &quot;My friends told me not to accept and there were many reasons why, but I don&apos;t think that way and I&apos;m not going to start now.

Although Sunderland should really have won quite comfortably Portsmouth, featuring Richard Hughes as a deep-lying midfielder, were organised intelligently and never surrendered. Such qualities enabled them to not only prevent Steve Bruce&apos;s side extending the early lead provided by Darren Bent&apos;s 10th goal of the season, but also to capitalise on Sunderland&apos;s late concentration lapse at the poorly defended stoppage-time corner from which Younes Kaboul bundled the ball home.   &nbsp;by&nbsp;Guardian Chalkboards   &quot;Things are looking up since Avram Grant became manager; he&apos;s helping us turn the corner,&quot; said Kaboul, whose joy was tempered by being sent off for a second yellow-card offence, namely removing his shirt in goal celebration.

Had the Tottenham Hotspur chairman, Daniel Levy, got his way, Kaboul would have now been a Sunderland centre-half but the player rebelled against a plan to transplant him from White Hart Lane to Roy Keane&apos;s then team along with Steed Malbranque, Teemu Tainio and Pascal Chimbonda in July 2008. &quot;The reason I did not come here was because of Daniel Levy. He told me he had a flight booked for me and said, &apos;You are going to Sunderland&apos;,&quot; said Kaboul. &quot;He wanted to treat me like a cow.

That does not mean it is genuine, as the Iraq experience demonstrated.

Most European intelligence services believe weaponisation work has resumed, but they are not sure whether it amounts to an effort to amass the necessary knowledge for use in a crisis, if the decision is taken to break out of the NPT and build a bomb in a hurry, or whether this work represents a determined drive to build a covert arsenal as soon as possible. Following the revelation of Qom, emerging evidence of recent weaponisation puts intense pressure on the search for a diplomatic solution to the Iran crisis, but it does not necessarily mean that time has run out. The biggest hurdle to making a bomb is amassing enough fissile material. Iran has enough Low Enriched Uranium to build one warhead, if it was further enriched to 90%. That in itself is no mean feat and would involve chucking out the IAEA.

She has had almost 12 months to reflect on the tragedy, a time in which hatred and anger might have consumed the 13-year-old. Remarkably, though, not only has she survived shocking injuries and a dozen operations, with many more to come, but she has retained both her sweet nature and faith in a bright future. Which makes it all the harder for her to return each day after school, dressed in the ubiquitous Palestinian uniform of blue-and-white-striped smock over jeans and trainers, to the scene of the massacre \u2013 her family home. It was Friday 16 January and Ghiada was studying for exams. Her father, a pharmacist, woke from a nap, demanding tea and shouting at the younger children to be quiet. &quot;Suddenly I could hear my cousin downstairs, screaming &apos;Dead! Dead!&apos;&quot; A shell had hit the building \u2013 a block of five apartments, housing the extended Abu Elaish family \u2013 smashing windows and causing extensive damage to the flat below. In the ensuing panic, Ghiada defied her father and followed him downstairs. &quot;One room was completely black. I saw Aya [my cousin], she was on the ground with wood on top of her. There was a big hole in the wall.&quot; Ghiada tried pulling Aya out from under the furniture. A second shell struck. &quot;There was a big light for a second,&quot; she says. &quot;I saw some windows smash and I heard screaming all around. A piece of shrapnel hit me. I started to scream for help and then fell down unconscious.&quot; Ghiada&apos;s father, Atta Mohammed abu Elaish, rushed into the room. &quot;I saw bodies without heads and legs. I saw my daughter. I saw her mother screaming.&quot; He ran outside to call an ambulance. &quot;The Israelis stopped the ambulances 250 metres from the house. Some boys from the street came to start ferrying the bodies and the injured out of the building.&quot; The attack was one of countless assaults during Israel&apos;s 23 days of war on Gaza \u2013 Operation Cast Lead \u2013 that began on 27 December. But it was also one of the most notorious because Ghiada&apos;s uncle \u2013 Aya&apos;s father \u2013 was a doctor who worked in Israeli hospitals and was well known to Israeli viewers for advocating peace and reconciliation. All through the conflict, Dr Izzeldin abu Elaish gave regular eyewitness accounts by phone in fluent Hebrew to Israeli television. Within minutes of the attack on his own family, he was back on the phone to a journalist in a Tel Aviv studio, weeping and begging for help as Israeli viewers listened: &quot;My daughters have been killed.&quot; Indeed, they had: Bissan, 20, Miar, 15, and Aya, 14, were dead, along with another cousin, 17-year-old Nour. Ghiada was in a critical condition; another of the doctor&apos;s daughters was also wounded. The injured girls \u2013 thanks to that live TV broadcast \u2013 were unusually and swiftly evacuated to a hospital in Tel Aviv, where Ghiada was found to be suffering from multiple problems with her heart, kidneys, stomach and legs. She remained in hospital in Israel for four and a half months. Now, Ghiada says, she thinks about that day &quot;always&quot;, but tries not to let others see her pain. &quot;When I am crying, I go to my room and cry alone,&quot; she says. Does she feel angry? No, she says, just sad. And she plans to stay put in Gaza: &quot;Maybe others would like to emigrate, but that&apos;s not for me.&quot; Toll of death and destruction But if Ghiada expresses no bitterness, her father insists she is angry and so is the rest of the family. &quot;It&apos;s very hard for us,&quot; he says. &quot;That accident took Bissan, Nour, Miar, Aya \u2013 and my brother.&quot; Dr Abu Elaish has left Gaza for Canada. &quot;He is the eldest brother, the father of the family, and now he&apos;s gone. How can we forgive?&quot; The shelling of the Abu Elaish family was unusual in that it caught the attention of the Israeli public, but what Ghiada continues to endure 12 months on is shared by many of Gaza&apos;s 750,000 children \u2013 half of its population. More than 1,400 Gazans were killed in the 23 days of the Israeli assault, including several hundred children. The actual number is in dispute. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) documented 313 deaths, almost 40% of them less than 10 years old. Other Palestinian groups say the toll was much higher. More than 1,600 children were injured. But the 23-day war is only part of the story. The long history of Israeli assaults on Gaza, and the two-and-a-half-year-long blockade of the territory after Hamas took power, has exacted a toll on almost every aspect of children&apos;s lives: schooling, housing, leisure time, what they eat, what they wear, how they see the future. A Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) survey earlier this year found that about 75% of children over the age of six were suffering from one or more symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. Almost one in 10 ticked off every criteria. &quot;The majority of children suffer many psychological and social consequences,&quot; says Dr Hasan Zeyada, a psychologist with GCMHP. &quot;Insecurity and feelings of helplessness and powerlessness are overwhelming. We observed children becoming more anxious \u2013 sleep disturbances, nightmares, night terror, regressive behaviour such as clinging to parents, bed wetting, becoming more restless and hyperactive, refusal to sleep alone, all the time wanting to be with their parents, overwhelmed by fears and worries. Some start to be more aggressive.&quot; Dr Abdel Aziz Mousa Thabet, professor of psychiatry at al-Quds university in Gaza, says the conflict has a different impact on boys and girls. &quot;Girls have more anxiety and depression, boys are more hyperactive.&quot; Some children no longer look on their homes as a place of safety, security and comfort. Others don&apos;t even have a home to go to. The Israeli bombardment damaged or destroyed more than 20,000 houses, forcing some families into tents and others into crowding in with relatives. Hamas distributed money to displaced families to rebuild their homes but the Israeli blockade has created a desperate shortage of materials. Almost one year later, some children still have no roof over their head. Hanan Attar, a slight 10-year-old wearing flip-flops several sizes too big for her small feet, is wistful as she recalls the house destroyed by an Israeli tank shell. &quot;We had land, my father is a farmer,&quot; she says. &quot;We used to grow watermelons, but the land was too close to the border and we can&apos;t get there now.&quot; Home is now a tent on a patch of scrubby sand, shared by 10 members of her family, including a 50-day-old baby sister with a pinched face and a tin of formula milk perched on her rusting iron crib. The baby, Haneen, is seriously underweight at only 3kg, and is not growing. Her mother, Arfa, 40, cannot breastfeed because she is taking medication for back problems; the formula costs 45 shekels (\u00a37.50) a tin, money that the family has to borrow. The father, too, is sick as well as unemployed. He reaches on top of a tall fridge that dominates the tent to pull down a sheaf of x-rays showing how his leg, broken in the conflict, is pinned together with metal. &quot;We are civilians, we don&apos;t belong to any faction,&quot; he says. &quot;What are we guilty of so that we have to live like this? I spent my entire life building up my home. In one hour everything was gone.&quot; Hanan doesn&apos;t complain about the tent, but says &quot;the house was better&quot;. She adds: &quot;A snake came one night and bit my mother. I can&apos;t sleep at night; I&apos;m scared of the snakes and the dogs.&quot; Meals are cooked on a Calor gas stove; the toilets \u2013 a hut donated by an Arab charity \u2013 are shared by all the families in the compound of tents. &quot;There are big queues,&quot; says Hanan. Winter is coming; the tent is &quot;freezing&quot;, she says. There is a community of tent families, circled round the shared lavatories. The children play as all children do, kicking a football, wrestling, dragging sticks through the sand. The families are doing their best in near-impossible circumstances. Some families have even planted small gardens in the scrub: corn and a few flowers. But Hanan \u2013 who wants to be a doctor so she can treat the sick \u2013 says she spends most of her time in the tent with her seven brothers and sisters. Do they think they will ever go back to a proper home? &quot;God knows,&quot; says Arfa. Overcrowding, lack of privacy and poverty are contributing to what some in Gaza call the &quot;mental siege&quot; . Tensions within families are increasing, say Gaza&apos;s mental health experts. &quot;Some parents themselves have depression and anxiety. Some become more aggressive towards their children,&quot; says Zeyada. John Ging, director of UN operations in Gaza, puts it like this: &quot;Parents are sitting there in their homes, very upset and very frustrated at the their situation, and that is of course having ramifications for the home environment.&quot; Has there been an increase in domestic violence? &quot;Of course . . . children are losing respect because of the breakdown of the role-model structure. They see their parents as incapable of providing for them, they&apos;re seeing their parents as a failure.&quot; Lost childhoods Part of the problem is the lack of release and entertainment for children. There are few gardens or parks, no cinemas or theatres, many sports facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombing, and one of Gaza&apos;s great natural advantages \u2013 a 25-mile stretch of sandy beach facing the Mediterranean \u2013 is hiding a fresh danger. In the summer months, families flock to the beach on Fridays and Saturdays. The sight of children splashing in the waves is cheering until one remembers that every day 20m gallons of raw sewage is pumped into the water. Since Gaza&apos;s sewage processing plant was bombed after the kidnap of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in July 2006, there has been no alternative means of disposal. Now, according to Save the Children, children are developing skin diseases as well as bacterial infections from swimming in polluted water. &quot;There are not enough safe places for children to play,&quot; says Mona al-Shawa, head of the women&apos;s unit at the PCHR. To counter this, the UN organised a hugely popular &quot;Summer Games&quot; during the long school break, despite objections from Hamas about boys and girls mixing together. &quot;There were those on the political side saying kids should be going to summer camps, not doing sport and recreation, but preparing for a future life of militancy,&quot; says Ging. Ging says schooling has also suffered. Thirty-two of the UN&apos;s 221 schools were damaged in the Israeli assault, plus scores more government ones. None have been repaired because Israel does not allow construction materials into Gaza, saying they could be used to make weapons. &quot;So the schools, where the windows were blown out or other damage was done, have been cleaned up, made safe, and continue in operation today without the physical repairs because we haven&apos;t been allowed to bring in one pane of glass or one bag of cement since last January,&quot; says Ging. Israel did permit a consignment of wood into Gaza to make school desks for 8,000 children, but then blocked delivery of the steel necessary to complete them. &quot;Now you see three kids squashed on to a desk,&quot; says Ging. &quot;How are teachers supposed to give each child the attention they need?&quot; There is also a shortage of school books and pens, and what does arrive mostly has to be smuggled through underground tunnels from Egypt. The result is children attending overcrowded schools on a double or even triple shift system that has contributed to a continuing decline in education levels. One in five of the 200,000 pupils at the UN&apos;s 221 schools in Gaza failed basic Arabic and maths exams this year. Engendering extremism &quot;It&apos;s shocking for them but it&apos;s also alarming for us in terms of the future,&quot; says Ging. &quot;The objective of the [Israeli] policy is to counter extremism. Education is probably the most effective tool through which you will counter extremism, by developing a positive and well-educated mindset. And yet we are being prevented by the policy from educating these children.&quot; It is, he says, &quot;facilitating the destruction of a civilised society and, worse than that, the development of an extreme society&quot;. One of the starkest examples of school destruction is the American International school, Gaza&apos;s elite fee-paying institution in Beit Lahiya, which was bombed in the early hours of the morning of 3 January. The Israeli military claimed it was being used as a rocket-launching site. Now, where once stood science laboratories, computer rooms, a music centre and sports fields, there is a mountain of crushed masonry, twisted metal girders, broken glass and droppings from the sheep that roam the deserted site. To the side of what was once the main building lies a row of burned-out schoolbuses. The odd fragment of textbook can be seen amid the rubble. Then there is the difficulty of trying to concentrate in class when children are clawed by hunger. Three-quarters of Gazans rely on food handouts, according to the UN. Save the Children says it is seeing newborn babies suffering from malnutrition. Anaemia, especially among girls, is common. The UN has started feeding children in its schools because, says Ging, &quot;they&apos;re coming to school without breakfast and therefore their attention span is very short and the academic results will then reflect that&quot;. Food, at least, is something that is relatively easy to fix. There are many less tangible issues that concern child experts, such as a lack of healthy role models. &quot;During the war, children could see that their parents could not fulfil their needs,&quot; says Zeyada. &quot;They see their fathers as weak, powerless. They see parents can&apos;t give them feelings of security, can&apos;t protect them. So they look towards other figures. That might be God as an absolute power \u2013 so children might go towards religion, become more fanatic. Some identify with fighters from Hamas and other groups. &quot;Without hope, we are moving fast towards more aggressive children, more fanatics. If the siege ended you would see positive changes among children. They [Israel] are creating their enemies. They are pushing a new generation of children to believe in violence as a way of solving their difficulties. They are creating their own enemies of the future.&quot; In September 2007 Israel declared Gaza a &quot;hostile entity&quot;. &quot;I said at that time, and I continue to say it, that&apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; says Ging. &quot;You designate it as a hostile entity, you treat it as a hostile entity and in fact what happens is you generate hostility. And that&apos;s precisely what we have been witnessing here at the grassroots level for the last two and a half years under this illegal siege . . . We have more extremism in Gaza every single day.&quot; Yet through it all, it is striking how many Palestinians cling to a belief in a better future. For all her traumas, Ghiada hasn&apos;t given up. She attends a thrice-weekly English lesson after school to improve her chances of fulfilling her dreams. The teacher hands Ghiada a question to answer to the class in English: If you were a colour, what colour would you choose? The girl doesn&apos;t hesitate. &quot;Red,&quot; she tells the class. The teacher asks the students what the colour red means to them. Blood, suggests one; danger, says another, both witnesses to last year&apos;s carnage. Ghiada considers for a moment, then replies: &quot;It makes me happy. It&apos;s the colour of love.&quot; And what will Ghiada do with her English? She wants to be an airline pilot, she says. Ironically that&apos;s one career choice that will certainly require emigration: Gaza has no aeroplanes and the runway of its only airport was bulldozed to rubble by the Israeli army years ago.

It was described as &quot;an upgraded version of an advanced missile capable of hitting Israel and parts of Europe&quot;. Judging by the reaction of the western press, it seems that the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has become very adept at convincing them of its superior military capabilities. And the fact that the Iranian government was able to do two tests of its Sajjil missiles in the space of seven months (the previous one being in May) is a sign that Iran is making significant advances in its missile programme. This missile also uses solid fuel, which is more advanced than liquid fuel, used by Iran&apos;s other missiles. Solid fuel can also stay in the rockets for months, while liquid fuel missiles need to be fuelled right before being launched, thus making them easier to detect and destroy. However, what the west should not forget is that Israel was already within the range of Iranian missiles before this test. And although the solid fuel capabilities of the missile make it more difficult to detect, Israel&apos;s new Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), which can fly over Iran for up to 36 hours, and its sophisticated spy satellites, which have greatly improved its intelligence-gathering capabilities, should not be overlooked. Iran is estimated to have roughly 100-150 missiles that can reach Israel. Most of these are Shahab-3 missiles, which have a low accuracy rate and a payload of only 1,200kg. Israel has an Arrow anti-missile system which is conservatively expected to stop at least 50% of them, if not more. Hezbollah, which is estimated to have at least 30,000 missiles (some have put the number at double that amount), could hit as far as Tel Aviv. However, again, one should not forget the Israeli Air Force&apos;s capabilities in this case. During the last war in 2006, all of Hezbollah&apos;s long-range missiles were destroyed within a few hours. The same could happen again, as Hezbollah&apos;s missiles are more difficult to hide. They are also much more within the range of Israel. What the west should focus on is that within Iran&apos;s perceived strength of developing new missiles lies a significant weakness. By engaging the west in an arms race, Iran could set itself up for a battle it could lose. Not only technically in terms of which missile has a longer range, but also politically. Israel and the west both have larger economic stamina than Iran in keeping up in such a competition over a long period of time. The Iranian government, whose already damaged economy is about to take a major hit through sanctions, over time will find it more and more difficult to pour resources into expensive military plans, at the expense of important social needs and projects. However, if it does, this could have the same impact on Iran as on the former Soviet Union \u2013 economic neglect caused by mismanagement and huge defence budgets, causing the ultimate collapse of the economy and subsequently the regime. Therefore instead of being concerned about an arms race with Iran, some western policymakers should welcome it. This could be a powerful way to gradually bleed the Iranian leadership of what keeps it alive \u2013 economic viability. Expensive Russian MiG fighter jets or intercontinental ballistic missiles could not hold the communist regime together for long. The same could work in Iran, especially after the post-election upheavals there. The more Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ignores the economic plight of his people due to excessive focus on the military, the more unpopular his regime will become. And now that the green movement has proved its popularity by continuing with its protests for six months, the chance that public resentment could turn into viable opposition that could endanger his regime is much higher. Engaging him in an arms race could be one way to make sure he falls into this trap. As the old saying goes, in every cloud, there is a silver lining.

Obviously, the Champions League/Europa League draws and South Africa v England will be core issues this morning and we&apos;ll have live coverage of them all. And what about the PDC world darts championship: will anyone stop the Power? JD  8am: There was a fair deal of snowfall around the south and east of England yesterday and it&apos;s accounted for today&apos;s race meeting at Ascot, where there&apos;s now also a 4pm inspection to see if Saturday&apos;s valuable card can still go ahead. JD  8.30am: Day three of South Africa v England is just starting, with Andy Bull in the hot seat for our over-by-over report. Meanwhile, overnight, the West Indies spinner Sulieman Benn was banned for two ODIs for his on-field altercation with Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson, who in turn were fined 25% and 10% of their match fee, respectively. Match referee Chris Broad said:  &quot;No one likes to see cricketers pointing bats at their opponents or pushing each other away. It is not the sort of example that players should be setting at any time.&quot;  A fair decision? JD  9.20am: You&apos;ll be glad to know today&apos;s Rumour Mill has battled through the snow to make it onto the site this morning. You can read it in all its icy glory here and find out which London club West Ham&apos;s Scott Parker and Matthew Upson might be moving to. Oh, and for what it&apos;s worth I fancy the long-bearded Simon &apos;The Wizard&apos; Whitlock to cause an upset in this year&apos;s PDC world darts championship. He&apos;s ranked 126 in the world, so understandably, he&apos;s a long shot. GR  10am: Here&apos;s what&apos;s coming up today:* The Champions League last 16 draw at 11am. We&apos;ll have a live mbm here.* The Europa League last 32 draw, which you can follow on Today in Sport* Various football pressers, but not Man City (it was due to be after the Spurs game but Mark Hughes didn&apos;t hang around ...)* South Africa v England, first Test day three. * Heineken Cup matches, including Dragons v Biarritz.* And last, and least, there&apos;s swimming: the duel in the pool  10.35am: Let Sean Ingle be your guide to the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League, with the competition finally - and belatedly - reaching the knockout stages. JD  11.30am: The Champions League draw: VfB Stuttgart v BarcelonaOlympiakos Piraeus v Girondins BordeauxInter v ChelseaBayern Munich v FiorentinaCSKA Moscow v SevillaOlympique Lyon v Real MadridPorto v ArsenalAC Milan v Manchester United JD  12.19pm: Right, we&apos;ve got action in Nyon in the Europa League draw. The big one of course for anyone of a Merseyside persuasion, ahem. GR  12.21pm: So far we have: Rubin Kazan v H. Tel Aviv, Athletic Bilbao Madrid v Anderlecht, FC Copenhagen v Marseille, Panathinaikos v Roma ...  12.23pm: Atletico Madrid v Galatasaray  12.24pm: Ajax v Juventus. So a tasty tie there.  12.25pm: Brugge are next out of the pot ... and they&apos;ll play Valencia so there&apos;ll be no reunion for Rafa Ben\u00edtez.  12.26pm: Fulham are out of the pot. Roy Hodgson&apos;s side face a trip to Ukraine and Shakhtar Donetsk.  12.27pm: Liverpool are out of the pot next ... and they will play Unirea Urziceni of Romania. So that doesn&apos;t promise to be a particularly special European night at Anfield come February.  12.30pm: Hamburg v PSV is the next draw and should be interesting while Villarreal will play Wolfsburg in what looks like the tie of the round so far.  12.31pm: Standard Li\u00e9ge v Salzburg.  12.32pm: Lots of serious looking men nod their heads as Steve McClaren&apos;s FC Twente draw Werder Bremen ...  12.33pm: It&apos;s Lille v Fenerbahce ...  12.33pm: While Everton face another trip to Portugal as they draw Sporting.  12.34pm: So Hertha Berlin v Benfica completes the draw for the round of 32 of the Europa League.  12.37pm: Full draw for the round of 32 of the Europa League: Rubin Kazan v H. Tel AvivAthletic Bilbao v AnderlechtFC Copenhagen v MarseillePanathinaikos v RomaAtletico Mardid v GalatasarayAjax v JuventusBrugge v ValenciaFulham v Shakhtar DonetskHamburg v PSVVillarreal v WolfsburgStandard Li\u00e9ge v SalzburgFC Twente v Werder BremenLille v FenerbahceEverton v SportingHertha v BenficaFirst leg of ties to be played on 16-17 Feb 2010  12.43pm: In a convoluted old process at Uefa HQ the last 16 ties of the Europa League were also decided. Liverpool or Unirea Urziceni will play Lille or Fenerbahce. Fulham or Shakhtar Donetsk will play Ajax or Juventus and Everton or Sporting will play Atletico Madrid or Anderlecht. Right, that&apos;s all your European draw fun for this snowy Friday. Now read today&apos;s Joy of Six of the best footballers of the decade and then have a moan about your favourite player being overlooked. GR             1.27pm: Forget RATM v X Factor. This should be Christmas No1 - especially on a day when Liverpool and Everton have just discovered their fate in Europe&apos;s second-tier competition. Here&apos;s a Merseyside band (Half Man Half Biscuit) singing about an obscure east European team&apos;s football kit. GR  2.34pm: Alan Wiley has been appointed to referee Manchester United&apos;s visit to Hull on 27 December. It will be the first time Wiley has taken charge of a Manchester United match since Sir Alex Ferguson was banned from the touchline for two matches for claiming the 49-year-old was not fit enough to be a Premier League official. Read more here ... GR  3.45pm: Harry Redknapp has promised to severely punish the Tottenham players who organised a rogue Christmas party in Dublin days after the manager banned them from excessive seasonal shindiggery. 16 players travelled to Ireland on a trip reportedly organised by Robbie Keane and Redknapp says all will be dealt with after the club&apos;s weekend game with Blackburn.  &quot;It was wrong and it will be dealt with. Severely. It will be dealt with. It&apos;s being dealt with internally and we&apos;ll keep it in-house. I will be dealing with it after the weekend. We&apos;ve got a game to concentrate on \u2013 we&apos;ll sort the game out, then I&apos;ll sort them out. Believe you me, it will get sorted out. I&apos;m not happy, I&apos;d be lying if I said I was happy,&quot; said Redknapp.  What with Redknapp now apparently joining the Tony Pulis brigade, are the Premier League&apos;s managers the most Scrooge-like bosses in the country? TB  4.30pm: Some quick breaking news: The Stade Francais scrum-half Julien Dupuy has been suspended for six months at an independent disciplinary in Dublin today following an eye gouging incident during the Heineken Cup match against Ulster on 12 December. TB  4.32pm: The Fiver has landed, today featuring men selecting balls from a big pot, Jens Lehmann, Ryan Giggs and, erm Whitesnake lyrics. TB  4.42pm: Graeme Swann has been revelling in the 85 her scored to prevent England sliding to an ignominious collapse against South Africa. His innings - which formed the lion&apos;s share of a 100-run partnership with Jimmy Anderson - allowed England to creep to 365 all out. They followed that up by taking the early wicket of Ashwell Prince for nought as South Africa came into bat.  &quot;It&apos;s going quite well at the minute. I&apos;ve got my way of playing and I&apos;ve got free license from the dressing room to do that,&quot; Swann said on Sky Sports. &quot;Today was one of those days where everything I tried came off and it&apos;s got us back in a good position. I&apos;ve had 10 years of throwing my wicket away willy-nilly and I think captains and coaches had given up on me as a batsman, but I&apos;ve earned that license and I&apos;m trying to use it now.&quot;We&apos;re great friends and to have a 100-partnership in Test cricket is something you dream about, so we&apos;ve over the moon,&quot; he said of his stand with Anderson. &quot;When Colly got out we were looking down the barrel at 200 behind with not much left in the shed so to get back to 60 down is a huge thing for us.&quot;    TB  4.55pm: Well, that&apos;s about it for the day. Thanks for all your comments. You can continue to debate the Champions League draw and the day&apos;s other sports news below the line. Keep it frosty.

The Romanian club, who are managed by the former Chelsea full-back Dan Petrescu, have also dropped out of the Champions League having finished third in Group G. The first leg will take place at Anfield on 18 February with the return taking place a week later. &quot;I think they got eight points in their Champions League group, which included Rangers, Sevilla and Stuttgart, so that&apos;s a decent number of points,&quot; said the Liverpool legend and current club ambassador Kenny Dalglish about Unirea. &quot;Obviously there is plenty of coverage now so there&apos;s plenty of tape there for Rafa [Ben\u00edtez] to have a look at.&quot; The manager himself is also weary about the challenge Unirea may pose to his side. &quot;It will be tough,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;Unirea won the league in their country and were in a tough group with Sevilla and Stuttgart - I have some friends in Sevilla so maybe I&apos;ll be in touch with them. &quot;But it is important to have an option to win any trophy. The Europa League is different to the Champions League but there are some good teams in it. &quot;We have to progress and then it is an opportunity to win a trophy and we will try to do it. &quot;We would prefer to play the second game at home but we have to be ready. It will be interesting.&quot; Everton, meanwhile, have been drawn against Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese side finished top of their Europa League group and represent the second potentially stern test from that country for David Moyes&apos;s team with them having already faced Benfica in the competition. Everton lost 5-0 in Lisbon before suffering a 2-0 defeat to the same side at Goodison Park. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to it, back to Lisbon again,&quot; said Moyes. &quot;Last time we went there was disappointing but this time we will hopefully go there with a full team and be able to put on a better show. &quot;Sporting will be really tough, they have been in and around the Champions League in recent seasons.&quot; Fulham, who made it into the last 32 with a 3-2 win over Basel on Wednesday, will take on the Ukrainians Shakhtar Donetsk. Elsewhere in the competition, Ajax face Juventus while Atl\u00e9tico Madrid take on Galatasaray. The winners of the latter tie will face Everton should they progress.

LIKE BLOOD FROM A STONE And so to Nyon, the only town in Switzerland named after the sound a seven-year-old makes when playing Forza Motorsport 3, for today&apos;s Big Cup last 16 draw. In recent years the ritual has become as predictable as an X Factor winner being Xmas No1: Uefa suit drones at great length before giving way to unfunky video highlights package and, after an inordinate amount of faffery and flim-flam, balls are rattled and rolled and Premier League sides are given a virtual bye into the quarter-finals. Not this year. To start with, Chelsea were paired with Internazionale, a tie which will see Jos\u00e9 Mourinho return to the Stamford Bridge bench for the first time since he left in 2007 with his ego bruised and wallet inflated. &quot;We have to fight against a strong team,&quot; admitted Carlo Ancelotti, whose relationship with the Special One is frostier than a Siberian snowman, before unconvincingly adding: &quot;If we don&apos;t have a good relationship, this game can be a good opportunity to return to a good relationship.&quot; Elsewhere, David Beckham was handed a return ticket to Old Trafford for the first time he, and his ridiculous lion&apos;s mane pony tail, left Manchester United in 2003. And, er, Arsenal were given a trickyish-looking tie against Porto. &quot;So ladies and gentleman, this is the draw,&quot; explained Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino. &quot;This is magic, this is passion, this is football!&quot; Luis Figo, in the hall, looked vaguely nauseous - but whether that was because of Infantino&apos;s ridiculous comments or Uefa&apos;s especially creamy canapes was impossible to say. Either way, let&apos;s hope the whole Big Cup knock-out jamboree lives up to such billing when it kicks off in February.

FIVER LETTERS &quot;Re: Whitesnake lyrics used as a whispered sweet nothing (Fiver letters passim). My recommended line to use is &apos;I&apos;m a love hunter baby, sneaking up on you. I&apos;m gonna give you all my loving and use my tail on you&apos;.\u00a0Gets &apos;em every time.\u00a0It&apos;s even more effective if you can say this while in possession of a late 70s perm&quot; - Kevin Alexander. &quot;Re: Simon Hopkinson&apos;s beef with the inclusion of Nottingham in England&apos;s 2018 bid (yesterday&apos;s letters).\u00a0Nottingham was a fantastic host of Euro 96, whereas all that Sheffield could offer was a greasy chip butty and a good pinch of snuff. I think the real reason is that he is still upset about the miners&apos; strike&quot; - Phil Roebuck. &quot;Re: EBJT&apos;s claim that &apos;Chelsea are the only club on course for 90 points&apos; (yesterday&apos;s bits and bobs).

Celtic&apos;s final outing in Group C of the Europa League on Thursday was a prime example; professional observers and fans alike were apparently seduced by the Parkhead side&apos;s second-half comeback to the extent of forgetting the appalling opening 20 minutes when they fell three goals behind to a very moderate Rapid Vienna. There seemed to be a collective readiness to ditch the memory of an entire campaign in which Tony Mowbray&apos;s side finished second bottom of a section brimming with mediocrity \u2013 Hapoel Tel Aviv and Hamburg were the other two undistinguished members \u2013 with one victory from six matches. Celtic had begun the series with a 2-1 defeat in Israel (they had led at half-time), which prompted many of their followers on a number of websites to describe the performance as the worst they had seen in Europe. But, until the resurgence at the Ernst Happel Stadium, the visit to Vienna promised to be the blackest of all, evoking dread of a repeat of the 5-0 whipping from Artmedia Bratislava in the qualifying round of the Champions League in 2005. This was an Austrian team who had been beaten 8-1 on aggregate by Hapoel \u2013 including a 3-0 reversal on their own turf \u2013 before the latter lost 2-0 in Glasgow in the penultimate game. Hamburg&apos;s unconvincing work merely underlined the impression that the overall content was consistent with the kind of form produced by bad teams. It certainly did not give Mowbray the right to claim, as he did after the match, that his players&apos; second-half work in Vienna should encourage them to go into next season&apos;s Champions League without so much as a hint of trepidation. This seemed especially ill-advised, as Celtic will have to secure the SPL title in order to guarantee their place in the group phase. The runners-up in the domestic championship will once again be obliged to go through a qualifying stage that will almost certainly pair them with opponents from one of the strongest countries, such as Celtic&apos;s meeting with Arsenal this season. Since they are currently trailing Rangers (and one Old Firm team is presently as moderate as the other), talk of future distinction in Europe&apos;s premier tournament smacks of unwarranted presumptuousness. Mowbray&apos;s suggestive talk may also prove to be ill-timed, as Celtic travel to Tynecastle this afternoon for a meeting with a Hearts team who have often troubled the Old Firm in recent years. Despite their own miseries over the past few months, Csaba Laszlo&apos;s erratic squad have already caused Celtic serious bother. It was only in stoppage time that they lost 2-1 at Celtic Park in the league in September, but returned the following month to inflict the 1-0 defeat that eliminated Mowbray&apos;s side from the Co-operative Insurance League Cup. In the process, they cost today&apos;s opponents possession of the only trophy they won last season. Peter Grant, Mowbray&apos;s first-team coach and former team-mate at Parkhead, is an incurable optimist and a Celtic fan to his bones, but he is cognisant of the difficulties of today&apos;s assignment and of the need for serious overall improvement in the level of the team&apos;s performance. &quot;I&apos;ve never been to Tynecastle when it wasn&apos;t tough,&quot; said Grant, whose playing career at Celtic lasted 15 years. &quot;They beat us in the League Cup and it was only in injury time that we beat them in the league at home. What we need is the kind of belief we have been showing recently, a real determination to win matches. &quot;I think what is encouraging now is that we definitely have more time to work with the players. It&apos;s especially important for a new management team, but it&apos;s been hectic since the start of the season. I think it&apos;s probably significant that, with no midweek games for many of the last few weeks, our performances have been better.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-12-20T00:10:08Z", "title": "Tony Mowbray's misplaced optimism belies Celtic's mediocrity", "sentences": ["There seemed to be a collective readiness to ditch the memory of an entire campaign in which Tony Mowbray&apos;s side finished second bottom of a section brimming with mediocrity \u2013 Hapoel Tel Aviv and Hamburg were the other two undistinguished members \u2013 with one victory from six matches."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/dec/20/tony-mowbray-celtic-europa-league"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Christianity", "Judaism", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "In a postal sorting office beside a bakery on an industrial estate in Jerusalem, hundreds of letters are carefully set aside for special delivery and treated with the respect accorded to sacred documents. The envelopes are variously addressed, but all are destined for the same place. And all are unanswerable, at least by man. This is the Letters to God department of the Israeli postal service, where each year more than 1,000 letters are received and once every few months opened, folded and, in a ceremony overseen by a senior rabbi, squeezed into the cracks of the Western Wall, in Jerusalem&apos;s Old City. Some are from Jews, some from Christians, some from believers of other faiths. One letter from Poland now in the post office is addressed simply: &quot;God, Jerusalem, Israel;&quot; another, from Australia: &quot;Dearest God, Western Wall.&quot; One from Britain reads: &quot;To a poor man in Israel;&quot; another: &quot;The Rabi Jesus, Tel Aviv.&quot; They arrive in many languages. Most these days are written in Russian, but others are from Germany: &quot;Gott, Klagemauer, Jerusalem&quot;; Mexico: &quot;Dios, Muro de los Lamentos, Jerusalem&quot;; and France: &quot;La Terre-Sainte.&quot; Some are more esoteric, like one sent from Ghana and addressed to &quot;The Cult of the Calebs, Israel,&quot; or another from Indonesia: &quot;To the mighty one YHWH Elohim, Jerusalem, Israel.&quot; Inside, they hold heartfelt messages of sorrow, or grief, or religious devotion. A pair of letters in Hebrew are addressed: &quot;To my dead mother,&quot; and &quot;To my dead father.&quot; One postcard, sent from the United States, and addressed to &quot;Dear Jesiu&quot; said simply: &quot;I love you. I think of you. I thank you.&quot; Beneath his signature, the writer had taped three nickels to the card. Some seem to have been inspired by visits or pilgrimages to Jerusalem, others by television preachers. One written in English and addressed to &quot;Mr Christ (God), Care of Jerusalem, Israel,&quot; began: &quot;I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in your television offer regarding the Christian faith and for your counsel and awards.&quot; It contained a cheque for one US cent. Others seem driven by fervent religious belief, like one two-page, handwritten letter sent from within Israel but written in English. Addressed to &quot;Son of the Nun, Joshua Cult, Israel,&quot; it began: &quot;Is it a crime to serve the last God?&quot; For the past 12 years Avi Yaniv, 66, has had charge of the Letters to God department and has tried to make sense of the mail that arrives each day. &quot;They come from depression, or stress or grief,&quot; he said. &quot;They ask for healing of a family member, or to make peace between a man and his wife, or between Israel and Arab countries. Some want material goods. We call it the checklist: they ask for a good job, a good wife, a nice car, a lot of money.&quot; He has two regular writers, one from Mexico and another from Belgium, who send letters every few weeks. But, under the rules of the postal service, Yaniv is not allowed to write back to them. Regardless of the faith of the writer, each letter is eventually delivered to the Western Wall and, after some time, the cracks in the wall are emptied to make way for new messages, and the old ones are buried in sacred ground. &quot;We believe the Western Wall is the closest place to God in Jerusalem,&quot; said Yaniv. Although letter-writing is in decline, at least in the west, there has been no reduction in the number of letters to God. Yaniv has noticed a sharp rise in letters from Russia and the former Soviet states in recent years, a sign, he believes, of the new openness in their societies. Occasionally there are letters from Jordan or Egypt, and once from Morocco, but letters from other Arab states are not received. Most letters are deeply personal. &quot;I had a letter from one person who didn&apos;t ask for anything from God. He just wanted to thank God for what he already had,&quot; he said. &quot;Another was from Russia from a lady writing to her dead father. She had an argument with him and wrote very difficult words about the way he had treated her. Another time we received a letter from a man who wrote to God after his wife passed away. He asked God to send his wife back to him in his dreams so he could see her once again. He missed her very much.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-12-20T19:21:04Z", "title": "Letters to God: Jerusalem's faithful delivery of messages from the world", "sentences": ["One letter from Poland now in the post office is addressed simply: &quot;God, Jerusalem, Israel;&quot; another, from Australia: &quot;Dearest God, Western Wall.&quot; One from Britain reads: &quot;To a poor man in Israel;&quot; another: &quot;The Rabi Jesus, Tel Aviv.&quot; They arrive in many languages."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/20/israel-jerusalem-letters-to-god"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Football politics", "Football violence", "Sport", "World news"], "article": "As in England and throughout Europe, most Israeli football teams have a hardcore element to their support base, and there are regular clashes between rival hooligan firms during every season. Betar Jerusalem&apos;s La Familia are the most notorious of these crews, thanks to their fiercely anti-Arab politics and their utter contempt for anyone they deem traitors to the nationalist cause. Betar have been dogged by the controversial behaviour of La Familia for years, with the team forced to play games behind closed doors after displays of particularly unconscionable behaviour by their fans, and the club has been docked points for proving unable to rein in its most wayward supporters. However \u2013 as I discovered last week at Hapoel Tel Aviv&apos;s Uefa Cup clash with Hamburg \u2013 not all football firms are by definition allied to the hard right, neither are they all enslaved to racially divisive ideologies. An hour before kick-off, several prominent faces from the Hapoel Ultras crew braved the pouring rain to solicit contributions for a local shelter for African refugees, the African Refugee Development Centre (ARDC). They stood in front of a huge banner which they&apos;d tied to the stadium railings, bearing a seemingly incongruous message: &quot;Hapoel Ultras \u2013 donation point&quot;, and as the clock ticked down to kick-off, the gifts poured in from fellow Ultras. The call had gone out on Ultras message boards earlier in the week, exhorting fellow fans to bring whatever food or clothes they could to alleviate the severe shortages experienced by the refugee community over recent weeks. This was the second time this season that the Ultras had rallied round for the refugees, and those taking part saw it as an essential part of their collective duties as Hapoel fans. &quot;Hapoel means workers&quot;, explained one supporter, decked out in a garish red Ultras hoodie, a scarf bearing the legend &quot;Workers of the world unite&quot; hanging from his neck. &quot;We&apos;re left wing, which means we don&apos;t hate Arabs \u2013 we want peace with them&quot;. Inside the stadium, supporters regularly hold banners declaring &quot;Love Hapoel \u2013 hate racism&quot;, and at a recent match hoisted a particularly poignant flag asking &quot;Who here isn&apos;t a refugee?&quot; Another fan spits at the mention of APOEL Nicosia, a Cypriot team whose acronym bears no connection to the Hebrew word Hapoel. &quot;We hate them, because they&apos;re all fascists,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Their fans hold banners with swastikas on, and they give sieg heils at the ground. We&apos;re part of Antifa, which is why we despise them.&quot; Antifa is a global network of militant anti-fascists to whom many left-leaning football supporters pledge allegiance, including dozens of clubs across Europe. As a result, respective football firms forge close ties with one another, as was evidenced at Hapoel&apos;s Bloomfield stadium where Hapoel fans sported club shirts of FC St Pauli, Manchester United, and other Antifa-linked teams. Hapoel Ultras are also part of the Alerta Network, a collection of football fans committed to fighting xenophobia on the terraces, who embody the true spirit of the Kick Racism out of Football campaign run by the English FA and its peers around Europe. Nic Schlagman of the ARDC, who co-ordinated the fundraising campaign with the Hapoel Ultras, was overwhelmed by the response from the fans. &quot;We continue to be amazed by the number of people from all corners of the Tel Aviv community who come forward to support our humanitarian work,&quot; he said.  This is our second direct collaboration with the Ultras, who have been raising awareness and giving support to this cause for the last five years. Initially it was a very big surprise to be receiving support from what many would perceive to be a group of fans more interested in partisanship and violence than the support of minority causes and social activism. However, their actions show once again what a surprising and remarkable country Israel is, and in particular Tel Aviv society.  With six full containers of food donated by the time the game began, it was clear that the Ultras had milked their extensive list of connections for all they were worth, and all that was left was for the ARDC workers to distribute the donations amongst the refugee community, and for the supporters to cheer on their team inside the ground. A 1-0 win over Hamburg secured Hapoel top spot in their group, and the Ultras will now travel to Russia for the next round of the cup, where rightwing crews of football fans are notorious for their violent behaviour. However, according to Antifa and Alerta, leftwing firms are on the up across Europe, and they take heart from the strong links forged between fans with every passing year. Actions such as that of Hapoel&apos;s Ultras for the African refugees, and the constant anti-racist campaigning undertaken by teams around Europe, must be applauded and encouraged in order for those on the far right to see that their poisonous message won&apos;t go unchallenged, either on the terraces or in the streets. Kicking racism out of football completely is a mammoth task, but it seems that the fans on the left are relishing the challenge to do just that.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-21T16:30:01Z", "title": "Israel's friendly football fans | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["However \u2013 as I discovered last week at Hapoel Tel Aviv&apos;s Uefa Cup clash with Hamburg \u2013 not all football firms are by definition allied to the hard right, neither are they all enslaved to racially divisive ideologies.", "&quot;We continue to be amazed by the number of people from all corners of the Tel Aviv community who come forward to support our humanitarian work,&quot; he said.", "However, their actions show once again what a surprising and remarkable country Israel is, and in particular Tel Aviv society."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/21/israel-football-hapoel-ultras"}, {"tags": [], "article": "\u2022\u2008We should not have put the headline &quot;Israel admits harvesting Palestinian organs&quot; on a story about an admission, by the former head of the Abu Kabir forensic institute near Tel Aviv, that during the 1990s specialists at the institute harvested organs from the bodies of Israeli soldiers, Israeli citizens, Palestinians and foreign workers without getting permission from the families of the deceased (21 December, page 15).

I&apos;d been on Christmas holidays in Ireland with my family, when I&apos;d seen the aerial bombardment unfolding on my TV screen. It took a couple of days to get in because the Israeli ground operation had just begun. A small group of Red Cross doctors and I were the only people allowed in or out. When we crossed into Gaza the scale of devastation and the eeriness were immediately striking. Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas on earth, and on the journey into UNRWA headquarters we travelled down empty streets with rubble and destruction everywhere. The only sign of human life was a single family scurrying across a narrow street with a couple of suitcases. I&apos;d been in Lebanon, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo, and in times of conflict you would find certain dangerous areas that would be very quiet and in other areas a lot of movement. I quickly came to realise that in Gaza there was no safe haven: everyone was terrified. This operation was unprecedented in scale and scope. At the main hospital the ambulances were streaming in endlessly. The quantity and nature of the injuries and the number of young children killed was particularly harrowing to see. The doctors bore the physical signs of exhaustion and bewilderment \u2013 there had been no let-up for them. High on their list of anguish was the nature of the injuries; phosphorus burning was very difficult to control and they were talking about other injuries that they couldn&apos;t fathom \u2013 wounds that wouldn&apos;t respond to conventional treatment. There were an extraordinary number of multiple amputations. My job now was solely about getting humanitarian aid into Gaza and out to the people. As the invasion was raging this involved difficult decisions, balancing staff safety and humanitarian need. We were going out in convoys of trucks with UN insignia and being shot at by the Israeli Defence Force. A number of our staff paid with their lives. The problem seemed to be a breakdown of communication between the higher command and the soldiers on the ground. On the night of 14 January we were in the compound. There was artillery and tank shelling in the vicinity \u2013 a built-up area of high-rise apartment blocks. We were particularly concerned about our 15 oil trucks, with tens of thousands of gallons of diesel and petrol. The building was shaking with the explosions and shrapnel was landing in the compound. At about 6am there was an influx of about 700 people fleeing their apartments. We were in continuous dialogue with the Israeli authorities in Tel Aviv, but by about 10 o&apos;clock the first rounds landed in the compound. We evacuated the civilians into a nearby school \u2013 everyone running the gauntlet of the Israeli fire. Over the next two hours, 13 phosphorus artillery rounds were fired into the garage, fuel depot and warehouse area, setting the place ablaze. We evacuated the fuel trucks, but the food stocks and medical supplies were destroyed. Unfortunately, the first casualty of conflict is the truth. Our military interlocutors were professional and honest and said it had been a mistake. But the Israeli government produced the knee-jerk line that they were responding to fire from our installations \u2013 a very grave and egregious allegation to make. This was subsequently, and in every case, corrected. Over the following week we organised operations from another location. Then, when the shelling stopped we had even more work to do. We had 208,000 children in our schools, and large programmes dealing with gender and women&apos;s activities and those with special needs. Now our priority was to evacuate the 50,000 people sheltering in schools and get the education going. Along with everyone else the kids were in a state of shock. The Gaza Strip lived in fear for 22 days. Teaching was adapted to give support to what they had witnessed. The particularly severely traumatised required medication, psychiatry, sometimes hospitalisation. My approach is to channel my emotions into determined action rather than into despair. In such an emotionally charged situation that converts into a lot of energy to do a lot of work. When you see the very real and positive impact of helping, it&apos;s therapeutic. Looking forward I see a real basis for hope. In Gaza, notwithstanding the awful experiences of the people, they remain decent and civilised in their outlook and behaviour. They are not consumed with hatred, they want nothing more than basic freedoms and basic rights, and they want the conflict resolved in a political way. I also know that the Israelis are a decent and civilised people and therein lies the basis of progress. What&apos;s very clear to us is that the political leaders are failing their citizens.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-27T00:06:45Z", "title": "2009 in review: Israel attacks Gaza", "sentences": ["We were in continuous dialogue with the Israeli authorities in Tel Aviv, but by about 10 o&apos;clock the first rounds landed in the compound."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/israel-attacks-gaza-john-ging"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Hamas", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "US foreign policy"], "article": "When Hamas held its annual anniversary celebrations in the centre of Gaza City it looked like a defiant and celebratory show. There was a male choir in camouflage fatigues singing on the stage, a sea of green flags in the crowd and wave after wave of self-congratulatory chanting: &quot;Far and wide, Hamas is shaking the ground.&quot; A year after Israel&apos;s devastating three-week war in Gaza, the Palestinian Islamist movement which controls the strip is still very much in charge and unbowed. &quot;No one imagined that after such a crucial war against our people and our resistance that anyone could plan such a proud anniversary as this,&quot; Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader and former prime minister, told the crowd. His defiant rhetoric celebrated the movement&apos;s 22nd year, pledged never to recognise Israel and claimed the whole of historic Palestine for the Palestinians. &quot;Palestine from the sea to the river, we won&apos;t surrender it,&quot; he told the crowd. But his words barely captured the reality of Gaza today. Israel launched its war a year ago, saying it was compelled to act to halt militant rocket fire from Gaza. After three weeks, 1,387 Palestinians were dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli rights group B&apos;Tselem, although Israel disputes those figures. Thirteen Israelis were killed. Thousands more Palestinians were left homeless and hundreds of factories were destroyed. Israel has kept up its economic blockade, which has prevented imports of reconstruction materials. Earlier this month the UN Relief and Works Agency, the main aid agency in Gaza, presented a family with a new home. It was built from mud bricks. For Hamas, the war itself has brought other changes. Despite Haniyeh&apos;s constant talk of resistance, the number of rockets fired out of Gaza has fallen dramatically this year. Hamas has announced that nearly all factions have agreed to halt the rockets and one Israeli paper reported this month that rocket fire from Gaza was down 90% compared to last year. Haniyeh himself hinted at this new stance in his anniversary speech. &quot;The resistance is strong and hitting everywhere, but we are more wise and more managed,&quot; he said. Mustapha Sawaf, a former editor of a Hamas newspaper, said this was simply a decision made &quot;in the national interest&quot;. Others put it differently. &quot;When Hamas entered the Palestinian legislative elections their slogan was a mix of resistance and politics. It has completely failed,&quot; said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at al-Azhar University in Gaza. &quot;Hamas knows resistance is going to cost them their regime in the Gaza strip.&quot; As Hamas has moderated its militancy so it has faced internal challenges from hardliners in Gaza demanding the movement take a tougher stance and institute a more rigidly Islamic code. Hamas has tried to reimpose control, often earning the rebukes of fellow Gazans. Although Hamas will not recognise Israel, it is deep into indirect negotiations over a prisoner swap that would see an Israeli soldier captured three and a half years ago freed in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. At the same time, while Haniyeh said Hamas would never recognise Israel he also repeated a previous call for a Palestinian state in the occupied territories alone. In Israel, meanwhile, there is a sense that the war was their success, but that another round of conflict is inevitable. Yoav Galant, the general in charge of Israel&apos;s southern command, noted recently how the rocket fire has dropped off. &quot;I can say that this has been the quietest year for the south in the past decade,&quot; he was reported as saying. &quot;It can last for months or years, but ultimately it is going to be broken.&quot; For Israeli analysts the diplomatic fallout for Israel that followed the war, including accusations against both sides of war crimes by Judge Richard Goldstone&apos;s UN report, is manageable and has not affected Israel&apos;s most important international relationship, with the US. Still, many Israelis are frustrated that their military was singled out for criticism, even as civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan are dying at the hands of western armies. Others worry that Israel&apos;s strategy towards Gaza is still unclear and undetermined. &quot;What will happen is that we will muddle through as usual,&quot; said Shlomo Brom, a retired general and an analyst at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. &quot;Eventually it is going to explode. Nobody will do anything, but when there will be a crisis we will deal with the crisis.&quot; For those living in Gaza today, the strip is already in crisis as a result of Israel&apos;s siege. Hamas has allowed a tunnel smuggling economy under the Egyptian border to develop, skimming a profit off for itself and preventing outright economic collapse. But it has brought de-development: most of the strip&apos;s factories are still empty and unused, the population is increasingly aid dependent and there are barely any long-term development projects. Nearly $5bn(\u00a33.13bn) was pledged by the world for the Palestinians after the Gaza war. On the ground here there is little evidence of it. &quot;We are moving backwards. Now we depend completely on what we receive from Egypt,&quot; said Amjad Shawa, a Palestinian aid agency co-ordinator. He talks about the hidden traumatic cost of the blockade and the sense of powerlessness many Gazans now feel. At the same time he fears the growing detachment from the West Bank and the disintegration of the Palestinian national movement. &quot;The issue for Gazans is not only humanitarian,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not that we need food only. Gazans are looking for their freedom.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-12-28T00:05:29Z", "title": "Hamas's rhetoric of resistance masks new stance a year after Gaza war", "sentences": ["&quot;What will happen is that we will muddle through as usual,&quot; said Shlomo Brom, a retired general and an analyst at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/28/hamas-birthday-celebrations"}], "docs": 251, "sentences": 359}
