Worlds, as it is known, was the thirtieth event of its kind to be held \u2013 this year in Antalya, Turkey and hosted by Ko\u00e7 University. It&apos;s an opportunity for young people from all over the world to engage in discussion on issues of social and political importance. In round one I found myself in a small room with teams from the Philippines, Israel and the US, discussing whether labour unions should be abolished. Quotas for women in university in the developing world; making communities responsible for honour killings; subsidising Twitter in authoritarian countries \u2013 the pros and cons of each of these and more were hurled back and forth across nine rounds. Almost four hundred teams had shrunk to just 32 by the final stages \u2013 which my team was fortunate enough to make this year at my third attempt. Ultimately Sydney University were the victors, to the delight of the rest of the Australian contingent, while the best speaker was an up-and-coming member of Singapore&apos;s political elite representing Oxford. Debating has become increasingly &apos;professionalised&apos; in terms of the preparation undertaken by teams serious about doing well at Worlds. Numerous warm-up tournaments occur in Europe, North America and Australasia, with teams keen to gain a reputation with adjudicators prior to arriving at Worlds. A peace-themed tournament in Malaysia even has cash prizes. With only fifteen minutes to prepare for each debate and no access to the Internet in that time, debaters must develop a very broad knowledge base. Highly specific topics this year on partitioning Sudan and on military involvement in Sri Lankan politics rewarded the well-prepared, some carrying around hefty tomes with every topic under the sun neatly indexed. My approach is the easiest and most pleasurable \u2013 reliable consumption of the Guardian Weekly. Worlds has grown so large in part because of the active participation of many students whose first language is not English, mostly from continental Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The cultural and linguistic diversity of the tournament generates both benefits and challenges. There are separate finals series for &apos;English as a Second Language&apos; and &apos;English as a Foreign Language&apos; teams, this year won by Tel Aviv University and Moscow State Institute of International Relations respectively. These help to acknowledge that while debating is about open dialogue, when it is necessarily done in one common language the playing field is by no means level. The cultural parameters in which a debate occurs can be less obvious. Worlds is held in a British Parliamentary style, with two teams on both government and opposition, and each team having a seven-minute speech for each of its two speakers. Points of information, which are a kind of interjection, are included, with the optional anachronism of posing as if you are holding your wig with one hand and the bill you are referring to with the other. Motions typically commence with the phrase &apos;That this house would\u2026&apos; \u2013 the implicit meaning of &apos;this house&apos; is very often Western liberal democracies. Debaters from, say, China, must work hard to establish common ground on which to build a persuasive case. Even American teams often struggle to adapt to the very particular format which is different to their domestic competitions. British, Irish and Australian institutions consistently perform well, feeling more at home in the style. Next year the tournament will be held in Botswana, very much a newcomer to the world university debating scene, but it is hoped that African participation will benefit from the accessible location. Of course Worlds isn&apos;t only about the debating \u2013 in fact the participants&apos; intellectual feats are miraculously performed despite nights filled with drinking, dancing and little sleep. Spending New Year&apos;s Eve at a beachside &apos;full moon party&apos; with unlimited free alcohol (and dancers on podiums pushing the limits of good taste) was enough for many debaters not to mind much whether they were on the list of finalists announced just after midnight. More than a few Worlds debaters could be spotted around the tourist traps of Istanbul \u2013 myself included \u2013 marking a brief hiatus before one of the great institutions of student life carried on into 2010.", "publicationDate": "2010-01-08T09:00:00Z", "title": "'I took part in the world student debate finals'", "sentences": ["There are separate finals series for &apos;English as a Second Language&apos; and &apos;English as a Foreign Language&apos; teams, this year won by Tel Aviv University and Moscow State Institute of International Relations respectively."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/08/students-higher-education"}, {"tags": ["Culture", "Film", "Documentary", "Documentary", "London film festival"], "article": "Having depicted modern Israeli life in his previous films, a run-in with several critics turned 39-year-old Tel Avivian film-maker Yoav Shamir on to the subject of antisemitism. In a quest to explore what the term means today he travelled from Israel to New York, Poland and Moscow and captured his startling discoveries in a Grierson Award-winning film, Defamation. Why did you decide to make the film? Some years ago I made Checkpoint, a film shot in checkpoints in the occupied territories where I&apos;d been a soldier. It got alot of attention and I started noticing that I&apos;d been referred to as &quot;the Israeli Mel Gibson&quot;, antisemitic, mostly by American journalists. It got me thinking about what it means when somebody is called antisemitic. The word is used all around us, it&apos;s like a white noise. Being Jewish, did you find that odd? Of course! It&apos;s total nonsense and a very offensive term for me. Before Checkpoint I wasn&apos;t a political person, I was just portraying something important, being honest. I think if we&apos;re doing something wrong we should open up the debate and deal with it. Why did you choose a playful, almost Louis Theroux style for your film?  I normally do strict cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style films where the camera just observes. But everybody I talked to about this film said, &quot;You can&apos;t make it, you&apos;ll never get away with it.&quot; The only way I thought I could tackle it was to do a very personal film. Humour is a great way to keep people interested \u2013 antisemitism isn&apos;t a very sexy subject so it&apos;s a way to make people watch and think. What did you learn? One striking thing I discovered was how many American Jews \u2013 not all of them obviously \u2013 are using antisemitism as a way of maintaining their identity. There&apos;s an [American] Jewish guy in the film who says &quot;Israel is our insurance policy&quot;, and for me that&apos;s a very bad thing. When you need to insure your house or car you ask for the maximum security possible. But it doesn&apos;t make sense for the people living in this place to do that. There are other ways of providing security, of living peacefully; it doesn&apos;t have to be through these violent measures. How representative was the class of schoolchildren that you follow to Auschwitz? They were just your average, middle-class Israeli pupils. For many of them it was their first time abroad but they were being worked up so much before this trip. Eventually it&apos;s almost funny: two of the girls talk to three elderly Polish gentlemen on a bench and presume what they say is antisemitic. When you&apos;re 16 years old you&apos;re influenced very easily. We went to a pizza place which they didn&apos;t realise was self-service ,and when nobody took their order they got very upset. They thought: &quot;They&apos;re doing it because we&apos;re Jewish, they&apos;re antisemites.&quot; Did that worry you? Yes, but it&apos;s not their fault. This tradition of hatred is being passed from one generation to another. A kid in the film says: &quot;What makes us special is that nobody can stand us.&quot; Even the older people, I don&apos;t think they&apos;re coming from a conspiratorial, cynical point of view \u2013 they truly believe that. It&apos;s like taking away from people the feeling that they&apos;re hated is so offensive to them it&apos;s almost unacceptable.

How many of us who have got caught up in these often bitter battles have hoped for some way of finding a common language through which we could discuss our differences? Perhaps Israeli film-maker Yoav Shamir&apos;s two-hour documentary Defamation screened on More4, in which he asks &quot;What is antisemitism today?&quot;, points the way. Zionism and the state of Israel were supposed to have eliminated antisemitism, so &quot;Why do the words Holocaust, Nazis and antisemitism appear so often in the Israeli press?&quot; asks Shamir. Antisemitism is on the rise, he is told. To investigate this, he uses a cool, slightly ironic, but engaged style. He spends most of his time either observing and talking with Abe Foxman, veteran head of the US Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the largest Jewish organisation combating antisemitism worldwide, or accompanying a group of Israeli senior high school students who go on the March of the Living, a trip to the death camps in Poland made each year by 30,000 youngsters. The ADL sees antisemitism rising everywhere. From Foxman, Shamir learns that the only answer is to stamp on it hard by playing on feelings of guilt about the Holocaust. Heavy-handed and exaggerated? Privately, even some senior ADL lay supporters think so. And when Shamir tries to explore what the rise in antisemitism consists of, he finds it rather elusive. Foxman and ADL officials tell him there&apos;s been a spike in US antisemitic incidents, which are now running at 1,500 a year, but when he asks them to identify a recent local one, where the physical evidence could be filmed, most appear to be very minor. He also learns that the Israeli students are indoctrinated with an exaggerated sense of the danger of antisemitism in Poland. &quot;We&apos;re raised to know that people hate us,&quot; says one. Another wants to absorb the mantra he hears from his parents: &quot;Never forgive, never forget.&quot; Before they leave for Poland they are briefed: &quot;You will not have contact with the local people,&quot; it&apos;s too dangerous. Shamir shows us that the threat of another Holocaust looms large both for the wealthy, elderly ADL supporters who go on international missions with Foxman and for the Israeli high school students. The former stand at Babi Yar in Kiev, where tens of thousands of Jews were massacred in 1941, and one woman says: &quot;The worst thing standing here is that it could happen again today.&quot; The students go to Auschwitz and believe the Israeli secret serviceman who tells them they&apos;re in &quot;hostile country&quot; and can&apos;t go out from their hotel in the evening because neo-Nazis will attack them. The ADL works very closely with the Israeli government in spreading the notion that the &quot;new antisemitism&quot; \u2013 extreme and unfair hostility to Israel \u2013 is the principal danger today. When Shamir asks whether there is any possibility that Israel&apos;s actions may lead to antisemitism, Foxman says: &quot;It&apos;s nonsense.&quot; This orthodoxy is displayed at a conference of the Global Forum for Combating Antisemitism in Israel. So, when Dr David Hirsh, from Goldsmiths, University of London, and founder of Engage, who agrees that there is a &quot;new antisemitism&quot;, bravely speaks of the iniquity of settlements and occupation and their role in making people hate Israel, he&apos;s suddenly treated like a pariah. Professor Dinah Porat, who runs an antisemitism research centre at Tel Aviv University, tells him: &quot;I don&apos;t get it, unless you were being ironic.&quot; Shamir concludes: &quot;Speaking with Dr Hirsh made me realise it&apos;s hard to say anything different.&quot; This message is central to the film. Shamir finds people having difficulty saying something different about antisemitism without then being branded as giving succour to antisemites. Shamir lets the camera, and a few carefully chosen words of his own, imply criticism and sympathy, often both at the same time. He&apos;s unhappy with those who fetishise the Holocaust, use antisemitism to hold Israel and the Jewish people back from living in the present and looking to the future, and deny that Israel&apos;s behaviour towards the Palestinians plays a role in determining hostile attitudes to Jews. He questions Foxman&apos;s methods and is deeply troubled by the attitudes of the students, but he shows sympathy for both. He never denies that antisemitism exists today and he encounters real, if rather confused, antisemitic attitudes on the streets of New York. But the film suggests there is more than one truth about antisemitism: yes, it&apos;s true that antisemitic incidents continue to occur, but it&apos;s also true that their significance is determined by the context in which they occur. If we could come together around this conclusion, we might find the common language required to bridge, but not deny, genuine differences. It&apos;s a deceptively simple message, but one that pleads for openness and an awareness of the complexity of antisemitism. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-01-14T12:42:40Z", "title": "Defamation v Anti-Defamation | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["Professor Dinah Porat, who runs an antisemitism research centre at Tel Aviv University, tells him: &quot;I don&apos;t get it, unless you were being ironic.&quot; Shamir concludes: &quot;Speaking with Dr Hirsh made me realise it&apos;s hard to say anything different.&quot; This message is central to the film."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jan/14/dissenting-new-antisemism-film"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday 18 January 2010  In a report about an arrest in Tel Aviv we converted 2,000 shekels to \u00a333; that should have been \u00a3333.   Israeli police have arrested a self-styled Jewish sage and disciplinarian who ran a tightly controlled cult of at least 17 women with whom they believe he fathered dozens of children. Goel Ratzon, whose name means &quot;saviour&quot; in Hebrew, is now on remand in a Tel Aviv jail awaiting a court appearance. Police painted a disturbing picture of a man who commanded his household according to a &quot;rulebook&quot;, laying down severe restrictions and financial penalties for the women in his life. Many of the women, who dressed in conservative Orthodox clothes, appeared deeply committed to him. Some bore tattoos of his name and face. His lawyer said he denied any wrongdoing and all his relationships were consensual. Ratzon appeared in an Israeli television documentary last year which showed dozens of women and children in the house. Several of the women then said they were married to Ratzon and they were shown combing his hair and feeding him. They threatened to kill themselves if anyone ever tried to harm their leader. One said: &quot;He is the messiah everyone is talking about. He is already here and he hasn&apos;t been revealed yet. The day he decides to reveal himself, the land will shake.&quot; His children all had names that were variations on his, Goel. Police believe he may have fathered up to 40 children with the women. During the documentary, Ratzon, who has long white hair and a thick white goatee, said of himself: &quot;I&apos;m perfect. I have all the qualities a woman wants.&quot; An undercover investigation was started in June last year after one woman came forward to complain of abuse. Police then raided the house in Tel Aviv, arresting Ratzon this week. He has not been formally charged but is being held on suspicion of enslavement, rape and extortion. A gagging order was imposed on the press, as is common in major police inquiries here, until today. Found in the house was a rulebook setting out a strict code of conduct for the women, with different financial penalties for infringements. &quot;No women shall marry nor shall any woman attack another, either verbally or physically,&quot; said the first rule. The fine was listed as 2,000 shekels (\u00a333). Other rules banned conversation anywhere but the living room and stopped the women from asking Ratzon questions. &quot;No woman shall sit idle when there are dishes to be washed, cleaning to be done, children to look after,&quot; said another. &quot;The evidence shows the suspect controlled his women with a firm hand, including their possessions and their money,&quot; said a police statement. &quot;He would dictate what they could and could not do, limit their movements and impose sanctions and various punishments, including the use of violence if they refused to obey.&quot; Ratzon&apos;s appointed lawyer, Shlomtzion Gabai, said around 30 women and 60 children were involved with him. &quot;As far as he is concerned, no sexual crimes have been committed,&quot; she told Israel Radio. &quot;The women consented willingly to relations \u2026 He may be different, but he&apos;s not a criminal.&quot; The children have been turned over to the authorities and some of the women have been let free.

By contrast, Yoav Shamir, the Israeli director of the film Defamation, shown on More4 this week, chooses mainly easy targets. He presents some interesting material but he does so in a way that does not make the most of it. The first easy target, queasily enough, is the film-maker&apos;s own grandmother who lives in Jerusalem. She says that Jews don&apos;t come to live in Israel because they are too busy swindling the non-Jews among whom they live. When I saw the film at the London Jewish Film Festival the audience laughed at Shamir&apos;s silly grandmother. If I was a film-maker I wouldn&apos;t use my grandmother in this way. The next easy target of the film is the Anti-Defamation League. I thought the ADL&apos;s autocratic but also slightly charismatic leader Abe Foxman didn&apos;t come across too badly, but his staff allow themselves to be portrayed as entirely incapable of explaining how contemporary antisemitism works and one of his rich donors is encouraged to make a fool of herself for the entertainment of the audience. Foxman and his entourage are shown being hosted as though they were heads of state in Rome and Ukraine. Foxman says that one reason why the ADL is treated with such deference on these trips is that its hosts are under the impression that the ADL is part of some hugely powerful global network. Which of course it isn&apos;t. The film itself though is tempted to trade on this old myth. Shamir finds further easy targets in the street in Brooklyn. He talks to black people who live alongside ultra-orthodox Jewish communities there and he shows them rolling around in the stories of antisemitic conspiracy. He finds old Stalinist Jews to say there is no antisemitism in Russia and he finds orthodox rabbis to say antisemitism is exaggerated by secular Jews so that they can continue to feel Jewish. The next easy target that Shamir chooses to portray as ridiculous is a group of Israeli 15-year-olds and their teachers on a trip to the sites of the Holocaust in Poland.\u00a0 Difficult and complex questions are being grappled with by serious people but Defamation does not really engage in a sophisticated way.\u00a0How should Israelis educate their children about the Holocaust?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the Nazi project to wipe the world clean of Jews and the fact that half the world&apos;s Jews now live in three cities along the coastal strip of the eastern Mediterranean?\u00a0How should Jews and Israelis educate their children to be aware of the ways in which their own family, communal and national histories are connected to the genocide, without creating an unbearable feeling of being universally hated?\u00a0How does the Holocaust relate to Israeli notions of national identity?\u00a0All big and important questions.\u00a0 I was talking to an Israeli teacher recently who runs some of these trips. I suggested to her that it would be interesting to bring Israeli children together with Polish ones to discuss issues relating to the past and the present.\u00a0I was disappointed that she did not seem interested and could not see the potential value for the children of such encounters.\u00a0It seems that the content and structure of these &quot;rites of passage trips&quot; is not set mainly at the level of individual teachers or schools\u00a0but tends to be rather more politically\u00a0scripted from above.\u00a0Shamir succeeds in suggesting that these trips are troubling, and that they should be run more thoughtfully.\u00a0I think it is right that Israeli teenagers should be educated about the Holocaust and I think it is entirely understandable that\u00a0the stories they learn about these huge events should feed into their own personal and national identities.\u00a0Indeed, this is true not only for Israeli and Jewish children.\u00a0 Holocaust education always has to do two things.\u00a0It has to bring out the universal lessons of the Holocaust, that racism can lead to genocide and that it must never be allowed to happen again, anywhere.\u00a0But Holocaust education must also tell what happened specifically to the Jews, and it must teach specific lessons about antisemitism.\u00a0Perhaps in Israel the first is too often neglected while in Europe it is the second which is sometimes forgotten. Another of the film&apos;s easy targets is Norman Finkelstein, the bitter and defeated American anti-Zionist. Shamir gives Finkelstein enough rope to hang himself and Finkelstein meekly obliges in a rather sad and pathetic way, culminating in his performance of a Nazi salute for the camera. Shamir makes me into the hero of the film. Normally I would enjoy being the hero but in this case he constructs my heroic status by misrepresenting what I do and what I say. I am shown making criticisms of the Israeli oppression of the Palestinians as though this was something controversial. I am shown arguing that contemporary antisemitism is in part a mystification of the real conflict, transformed by racist language and grotesque narratives. I actually said more that day than the one-sided soundbite that Shamir wanted to hear. There were some hard rightwingers at the conference who hated what I said and who heckled me. There were some anti-racists who liked what I said and congratulated me. Like in any other movement against racism, there are significant political differences in the global struggle against antisemitism. Dina Porat, who is shown angrily arguing with me is not all that scary! I gave a presentation at her own centre at Tel Aviv University the following day and we had a serious scholarly discussion. Three of the key figures at the Global Forum are genuine liberals and antiracists: John Mann, the British Labour MP, Gert Weisskirchen, the veteran German Social Democrat and Irwin Cotler, the Canadian human rights lawyer and politician. The overwhelming majority of the Israelis at the conference were two-staters, people who have been committed for decades to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Shamir preferred to present the story as a group of dishonest rightwing defenders of Israel being confronted by one heroic British sociologist. Very nice, but not a true picture. Since that conference Israel has lurched to the right, as has the ministry of foreign affairs, which is currently headed by Avigdor Lieberman, a man who garnered votes in the general election by rhetorically threatening the position of Arab citizens of Israel. I suspect somebody in the ministry saw Defamation, because although I was invited to the conference this year, I was not asked to speak. Here is my report of this year&apos;s event. What worries me is that many who see the film will come away with the impression that contemporary antisemitism is basically invented by &quot;Zionists&quot; in order to de-legitimise criticism of Israel. If that is what his film encourages people to think, or if it allows people to come away with that impression, then it is a worrying film, even if it does raise some interesting issues. Who was the film for? Why was an Israeli film-maker making a film in English? It wasn&apos;t for Israelis. It wasn&apos;t an Israeli journey of self-discovery, it was a performance for an international non-Israeli audience which lapped it up, at the Berlin film festival, the London film festival etc. As a film about contemporary antisemitism it fails to get to the heart of any issues. As a polemic, it fails to hit any of its enemies&apos; strong positions. The truth is it doesn&apos;t require much courage at all to stand up and oppose Israeli human rights abuses. People do it all the time. Israelis do it all the time. It is the illusion of the moment, pushed by films such as Defamation, pushed by the self-promotion of the anti-Zionists that there are fearsome prices to be paid for supporting Palestinian liberation. Personally, I find it much more frightening to stand up for a democratic and genuinely liberational kind of criticism against the current British orthodoxy of casting Israel, and the Jews who support it, as uniquely and especially threatening. \u2022 This article was amended at 11.15am at the request of the author \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-01-15T10:37:24Z", "title": "I'm no hero for defending Palestinians | David Hirsh", "sentences": ["I gave a presentation at her own centre at Tel Aviv University the following day and we had a serious scholarly discussion."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/15/yoav-shamir-film-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["History", "Politics", "Judaism", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Shlomo Sand presses his thumbs together, palms outward, fingers stretching up like the branches of a candelabra. &quot;If you can visualise it\u2026&quot; The air above our table is meant to be the Mediterranean region shortly after the birth of Christ. Sand&apos;s hands are rival monotheistic cults. &quot;There are two kinds of Judaism: Christianity and a kind of Judaism that starts to close in on itself because of the success of Christianity.&quot; The hands drift apart. The fingers on the right withdraw into a fist. &quot;The vision that we have of Judaism today came out of this closedness, because of fear; because of the conditions imposed on Judaism if it was to continue under Christianity.&quot; A middle-aged academic with a close-cropped beard, dark polo-neck and metal-rimmed glasses, gesticulating over coffee, is hardly a controversial sight in a cafe on Paris&apos;s Place d&apos;Italie. But this particular mime is deeply subversive. Sand is a professor at Tel Aviv university and author of The Invention of the Jewish People. His quiet earthquake of a book is shaking historical faith in the link between Judaism and Israel. Sand&apos;s hands are depicting how most Jews are descended from converts who never set foot in the Holy Land. That has come as a bit of a surprise to many Jews and as a colossal affront to Zionism, Israel&apos;s national ideology. The modern Israeli state was founded on belief in a &quot;Jewish people&quot; as a unified nation, established in biblical times, scattered by Rome, stranded in exile for 2,000 years, then returned to the Promised Land. But according to Sand there was no exile, and as he seeks to prove by dense forensic archaeological and historical analysis, it is meaningless to talk today about a &quot;people of Israel&quot;. At least not if by that you mean the Jews. It is hard to imagine a more fundamental challenge to the idea of a modern Jewish state on the site of ancient Judea. Yet the book was a bestseller in Israel and is spreading worldwide. It won a prestigious literary award in France, where Sand is currently on sabbatical. But the reaction of the Jewish community there was hostile. &quot;Hysterical,&quot; he says. Sand&apos;s own manner in print and in person is urgent rather than polemical; more deadpan than diatribe. He understands the controversy. &quot;After years and years of using phrases like &apos;Jewish \u00adpeople&apos; and &apos;Jewish nation for 4,000 years; it isn&apos;t so easy for them to accept a book like mine.&quot; Sand&apos;s detractors portray the book as an assault on Jewish identity and the legitimacy of Israel. But he sees it as the opposite: an attempt to rescue Jewish-Israeli identity from an intellectual abyss and redeem Israeli society with a healthy dose of secular rationalism. &quot;I wrote the book for a double purpose. First, as an Israeli, to democratise the state; to make it a real republic. Second, I wrote the book against Jewish essentialism.&quot; This, Sand explains, is the tendency in modern Judaism to make shared ethnicity the basis for faith. &quot;That is dangerous and it nourishes antisemitism. I am trying to normalise the Jewish presence in history and contemporary life.&quot; That means chipping away at the Jewish self-image of survival by insularity \u2013 withstanding thousands of years of persecution by virtue of non-proselytising, cultural and religious introspection. In Sand&apos;s analysis, early Judaism pioneered the art of conversion. To spread as quickly as it did, Christianity must have exploited an earlier Jewish expansion. Later, another mass conversion took place in the Black Sea kingdom of Khazaria towards the end of the eighth \u00adcentury. The Khazar elite acquired Judaism as a form of diplomatic neutrality in the surrounding clashes between Christianity and Islam. That conversion gradually scooped up people of mixed ethnic \u00adbackgrounds who are, Sand believes, the main ancestors of Eastern European Jewry. The Khazar conversion is no revelation. It was the basis for a 1976 book by Arthur Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe, which was reviled, then ignored, by mainstream Zionism. But the Jewish Khazars were recognised by early Zionist historians, albeit as a numerically insignificant curiosity. They were only dropped from the story in the 1960s. After the 1967 Six Day War, to be precise. Sand notes that the disappearance of converts from Israeli history books coincides with increased occupation of Arab land. This is not a conspiracy theory. Zionism was a typical modern nation-building exercise. It followed the pattern by which most European national identities were forged in the 19th and 20th centuries. Intellectual elites propagated myths that met &quot;the deep ideological needs of their culture and their society&quot;. In Israel&apos;s case that was the myth of ethnic origins in a biblical kingdom based around Jerusalem. But, say Sand&apos;s critics, since all national identities are myths, why pick on the Jews? Only a few fundamentalists think God actually promised Israel to Moses. Meanwhile, millions of Jews feel a cultural and religious attachment to Zion. It is in their liturgy and their sense of self. It is no fiction. That is the rebuke issued by Simon Schama in a recent review. &quot;The book fails to sever the remembered \u00adconnection between the ancestral land and Jewish experience,&quot; Schama wrote. &quot;What chutzpah coming from Simon Schama, speaking about his ancestral land!&quot; Sand says, eyes widening. &quot;He doesn&apos;t want to come to his &apos;ancestral land&apos; to live!&quot; Sand is scathing about accusations made by Jews living elsewhere that his book is anti-Israel. From the comfort of the diaspora they charge him with sedition. Some say his thesis fuels antisemitism. Overseas donors to Tel Aviv University have called for him to be sacked. But Sand has voted for Israel with his feet. He is not anti-Zionist, he says, but post-Zionist: accepting modern Israel as a fait accompli. Besides, his interest in the country&apos;s survival as a democracy is not theoretical. His family lives there. Diaspora Zionists can nurture the Jewish myth of biblical nationhood as dual citizenship alongside their passports from safer states. When they refer to &quot;Israel&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot; in their prayers, they do not have to distinguish between scriptural metaphor and political reality. It is a distinction on which Israel&apos;s survival depends. &quot;A lot of pro-Zionists in London and New York don&apos;t really understand what their great-grandparents felt about Zion,&quot; says Sand. &quot;It was the most important place in the world in their imagination, as a religious, sacred land, not a place to emigrate.&quot; That &quot;Israel&quot; was a metaphysical destination to be reached at the End of Days. The modern Israeli state is a political enterprise, conceived in the late 19th century, made necessary by the Holocaust, founded in 1948. It is a young country. Many Jews see that as a weakness. The more insecure they feel, the tighter they cling to the myth of an ancient mandate. But Israel&apos;s best hope is to acknowledge that its nationhood is invented, and modernise even more. It must, Sand argues, reform itself so the state belongs to all its citizens, whether Jew or Arab. He admits that sounds utopian under current circumstances. But the alternative means Israel gambling its future on the consolidation of a mythic &quot;people&quot; in their &quot;ancestral homeland&quot;. That is 20th-century-style ethnic nationalism.

Reza Pankhurst, who spent four years in Egyptian prisons for membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), had anticipated criticism when he began studying for a PhD and delivering lectures to students. HT, which advocates the creation of a Muslim caliphate in the Arab world, is outlawed in Egypt but legal in Britain. The Conservatives have threatened to ban it, the National Union of Students adopts a &quot;no platform&quot; policy over its speakers, and the Home Office has said it keeps the status of the organisation under review. In an interview with the Guardian, Pankhurst, 34, said individuals were being &quot;hounded because of their views&quot;, and that dissent from Muslims was being silenced. The LSE has defended his right to &quot;freedom of expression within the law&quot;. Fears about radicalisation of students have re-emerged since the failed airline bombing carried out by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Christmas Day. He had studied at University College, London. Pankhurst was detained with two other Britons in Cairo in 2002, and the three were adopted as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International. Pankhurst was tortured with electric shocks. On his return to Britain he was questioned by British security services. The latest accusations, he says, raise questions about the role of Muslims in British society and the limits of academic freedom in universities. &quot;I knew this would happen one day,&quot; Pankhurst said. &quot;When I came back from Egypt I thought I wouldn&apos;t be able to get a job but I wanted to make a contribution and engage in positive debate. &quot;So I applied to the LSE and told them exactly what had happened to me. They accepted me on a master&apos;s course in the history of international relations. I was interviewed by the security services when I returned and later followed around. For the first couple of months I saw the same man on the school run, in the leisure centre and outside my house. &quot;He looked out of place. Perhaps they just wanted to show me they were [monitoring] me? But once they saw I was at LSE and speaking openly about my beliefs I imagine they assumed it was a waste of further resources.&quot; In 2002, the Guardian interviewed Pankhurst through the grille of an Egyptian security compound while he was standing beside one of the other detained Britons, \u00adMaajid Nawaz. After returning from Egypt, Nawaz renounced Hizb ut-Tahrir and helped found the Quilliam Foundation. It describes itself as &quot;the world&apos;s first counter-extremism thinktank&quot;. In a comment to the Times last week, the foundation said: &quot;(HT&apos;s) infiltration of internationally renowned universities such as the LSE makes a mockery of universities&apos; claims to be tackling extremism on campus.&quot; Pankhurst, who is married with a young family, said he and Nawaz are no longer &quot;in touch&quot;. Pankhurst, who remains a member of HT and preaches at Friday prayers, insists he is opposed to terrorist violence. He recently spoke about Abdulmutallab, saying he had not been radicalised in London. &quot;What [my accusers] forgot to say was that I spent 10 minutes stressing that any action that targets innocents is prohibited and that there&apos;s no justification for it in Islam. [Abdulmutallab] was radicalised by a sense of injustice \u2026 by what he saw on the news about Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot; Pankhurst also rebutted claims that he helped &quot;groom&quot; another ex-student, Omar Sharif, who blew himself up in Tel Aviv in 2003. &quot;This guy must have been on the course at the same time as me at King&apos;s \u00adCollege in 1996. I was president of the Islamic Society,&quot; Pankhurst said. &quot;Does that mean I was responsible for what he did seven years later? It&apos;s neocon nonsense. It&apos;s crime by association.&quot; Pankhurst is taking legal advice over &quot;this false allegation&quot;, he says. Such slurs, he said, are a &quot;form of Mc\u00adCarthyism directed against Muslims who speak out&quot; against UK foreign policy. &quot;Do they want Muslims to be engaged in professional fields or would they prefer us to be on benefits? The innuendo, blacklisting and McCarthyite witch-hunts are very counter-productive. I have not said anything which is illegal, or anything that incites violence.&quot; An invitation to Pankhurst to participate in a debate entitled &quot;Shariah law \u2013 compatible in the modern world?&quot; at Queen Mary, University of London, was withdrawn before Christmas because of his HT membership. Pankhurst has received supportive emails from LSE students, and the school is standing by him: &quot;No concerns about his conduct have been raised and we are not aware that he is a member of any proscribed organisation or has broken any laws or LSE regulations,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;All students and staff are entitled to freedom of expression within the law.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2010.

Israeli newspapers and radio stations gave extensive coverage of the affair today, with allegations from other former staff and accounts of Sara Netanyahu&apos;s reported behaviour. Last week lawyers for the couple&apos;s former maid, Lillian Peretz, filed a lawsuit at a Tel Aviv labour court asking for about \u00a350,000 in damages. Netanyahu&apos;s aides dismissed the allegations as &quot;lies and slander&quot; and suggested the case was driven by an Israeli paper caught in a circulation war. The Yedioth Ahronoth paper featured the case prominently in its Friday edition, but it was a columnist at another paper who yesterday produced the most damning conclusion. Ben Caspit, of Ma&apos;ariv, wrote: &quot;The person serving as the prime minister of Israel is unfit for the job. Everyone surrounding him knows that.&quot; So far there is no sign that Netanyahu&apos;s position is under real threat. Peretz worked in the Netanyahu family home, in Caesarea, for six years. In the lawsuit she reportedly claimed that the prime minister&apos;s wife, a psychologist, denied her basic social benefits and shouted at her for not following rules. Among the rules was allegedly the instruction that the employer be addressed only as &quot;Mrs Sara Netanyahu,&quot; following her husband becoming prime minister last spring. Sara Netanyahu reportedly insisted the maid had several showers a day and took four sets of clothes to work &quot;to maintain maximum sterility and not pollute the house&quot;, according to an excerpt of the lawsuit published in the Yedioth. &quot;Sara \u00adNetanyahu, like in the Cinderella story, piled on her impossible tasks, tyran\u00adnised her and screamed at her, caused her unreasonable expenses from her own pocket, insulted her femininity by \u2026 commands meant to suppress her femininity, and made her sign a document that she would not reveal things that occurred in the house, until her mental and physical collapse,&quot; it reportedly said. The lawsuit maintains Netanyahu forced the maid to work on the sabbath and that on one occasion she phoned Peretz at 2am &quot;and asked for an explanation as to why a pillowcase did not adequately cover the pillow in the bedroom&quot;. The allegations echoed criticism Sara Netanyahu faced when her husband was first prime minister in the late 1990s; then she was accused of arguing with staff. The Netanyahus fought back against the claims saying they rarely used the house. They said there were photo\u00adgraphs of Peretz embracing Sara Netanyahu and quoted the maid&apos;s resignation letter which talked of her &quot;love and appreciation&quot; of the family. &quot;In total contrast to what is written in the lawsuit, the plaintiff Lillian received warm and affectionate treatment from Mrs Netanyahu,&quot; the prime minister&apos;s office said in a statement. David Shimron, a lawyer for the couple, told Israel&apos;s Army Radio that Peretz was &quot;being taken advantage of by a certain media outlet&quot;. That appeared to refer to the Yedioth, which is in a circulation battle with Israel Hayom, a paper sympathetic to Netanyahu. But it was Caspit who delivered the strongest criticism, claiming that the prime minister&apos;s wife had too much influence over Netanyahu&apos;s work.", "publicationDate": "2010-01-17T22:52:42Z", "title": "Netanyahu aides dismiss ex-maid's allegations against his wife as lies", "sentences": ["Last week lawyers for the couple&apos;s former maid, Lillian Peretz, filed a lawsuit at a Tel Aviv labour court asking for about \u00a350,000 in damages."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/netanyahu-maid-allegations-wife"}, {"tags": [], "article": "\u2022\u2008A picture with a report on GE, From light bulbs to jet engines: why General Electric still has spark (15 January, page 36) was captioned in part: A US engineer works on one of General Electric&apos;s jet engines.

For nearly five million Israelis, unusually experienced in adversity, the Iraqi missiles that landed yesterday were a terrible \u00adwarning that this war may be very \u00addifferent from any they have known. Most people were asleep when it happened. Sirens wailed in Tel Aviv and Haifa only after the explosions, and in some parts of Jerusalem the job was left to civil defence loudspeaker vans touring the deserted streets. It was a bad end to what had looked like an encouraging day. Initial euphoria at the allied pounding of Iraq had given way, as dusk fell on Thursday, to caution that not all President Saddam Hussein&apos;s missiles had been destroyed. The missiles came suddenly: only minutes separate the enhanced Scud-Bs&apos; camouflaged launching sites in the south-western Iraqi desert from Tel Aviv. Direct casualties were astonishingly low. Only 12 people suffered superficial injuries from the blast and shrapnel produced by conventional high explosives. In Tel Aviv, a textile factory and two homes were destroyed. In Haifa there was little damage and no injuries. A three-yard wide crater in an empty lot was all that was left of one missile. Fifty other people were admitted to hospital, including newly-arrived immigrants from the Soviet Union as a result of prematurely injecting themselves with an anti-nerve gas agent. Precise locations of the seven or eight Scud hits were not revealed, to prevent the Iraqis from improving their aim if there is a second salvo.

It was not to be. The moment the alert was sounded, people tumbled out of bed and into their safe rooms, windows sealed with plastic masking tape, bleach-soaked towel stuffed under the door. Even the keyhole had to be blocked. One effect of the missile salvo was a wave of international sympathy. Get hit by a Scud, someone quipped bitterly, and suddenly you are an underdog again.

My life in the historic centre of Paris and also of France&apos;s Jewish community is a definitely a change from Guildford or my South Bank office. As someone who dines kosher, one of the early pluses of my new life in Paris is definitely better food and wine. There are over 200 kosher restaurants in Paris which serves half a million Jews living in the French capital. A proud Jewish Parisian informed me that this makes the city the kosher gastronomical capital of the world with more restaurants per capita than New York, Los Angeles or London. I was too polite to bring up Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. A discussion with friends over kosher sushi resulted in the general consensus that there had been a massive improvement in Kosher Japanese and Chinese food in Paris in the last few years as better chefs had been brought in to run the kitchens. The quality of food seems to be important and bad restaurants have no place. In London, we have far fewer kosher restaurants and for years, in a very British way, we have smiled and accepted mediocrity with the attitude that &quot;if we don&apos;t use it, we will lose it&quot;. Those of my London friends who are not strictly kosher have often given backhanded compliments to the effect that our best restaurants in London &quot;are not bad for kosher places&quot;. We put up with it in the same way that commuters put up with the lack of seats on trains. Just like the train service, the restaurants are slowly getting better but remain expensive. The attitude to food in Paris is definitely different. It is part of life and culture here and there is no sentimentality. Near me, Jo Goldenberg, a restaurant dating back to the pre-war Yiddish community and itself a Parisian landmark, visited by successive French Presidents, has been closed and transformed into a fashion boutique. Its historic significance did not save it. Other restaurants in the area come and go in what is a cut-throat business. Paris had a kosher Indian restaurant before London which takes its place alongside French, Italian, American, Yiddish, Moroccan, Chinese, Japanese and Middle Eastern kosher restaurants. Naturally, there are always exceptions to the rule. There are bad kosher restaurants in Paris and good ones in London. However, it&apos;s high time that the food critics took on bad kosher gastronomy in London whilst raising the status of the few good restaurants. Some of the best-known food critics in Britain are Jewish. Many of them have transformed attitudes to food and restaurants in London in the last 20 years.

His girlfriend, a Lutheran church volunteer who flew back with him, was deported two days later., but Malsin was held in detention at a cell in the airport while he began a legal challenge to his deportation order. Early today Malsin, who has worked with the Ma&apos;an news agency for two years as its English news editor, spoke by telephone to a colleague to say he was being deported and was then put on a flight to New York. &quot;He was not in a good place. He sounded very confused,&quot; said George Hale, a staff writer at Ma&apos;an. Sabine Hadad, a spokeswoman for the Israeli interior ministry, said Malsin had refused to answer questions and co-operate with security staff when he landed at the airport last week. &quot;It is the minimal right of every immigration authority to ask questions or to clarify things that are not clear about every person who wants to enter Israel,&quot; she said. &quot;He refused to co-operate and we told him if he continued to refuse he would not enter Israel.&quot; Hadad said they did not know Malsin was a journalist until they were contacted by the press about his detention. However, Hale said Malsin was interrogated repeatedly and was asked about articles he had written from the occupied West Bank that were critical of Israeli policies. Hale said Malsin had briefly overstayed his last tourist visa, but was registered as a journalist with the Palestinian Authority and with the authority&apos;s labour ministry. He had applied for an Israeli government-issued press card, which most foreign journalists here carry, but was told it would not be granted because he was based in Bethlehem, in the West Bank. &quot;They knew he was a journalist,&quot; said Hale. &quot;We are in contact with Israeli spokespeople going about our daily work and we have never had someone so much as held up, much less deported. My opinion is that this is a mistake. I can&apos;t believe they didn&apos;t call it off.&quot; Court documents seen by Ma&apos;an showed that Malsin&apos;s interrogators said he was denied entry to Israel at the airport because he refused to co-operate, lied to border officials, gave unclear reasons for arriving and violated his visa terms. Hale said he was concerned and puzzled about a document that Malsin signed on Tuesday, after his lawyer had left him, in which he annulled his legal challenge to the deportation order. After that the Israeli judge on the case closed the deportation file, meaning it can no longer be challenged. After Malsin was first held at the airport Ma&apos;an described his detention as arbitrary and &quot;an affront to journalists not only in Palestine, but in Israel and abroad.&quot; Ma&apos;an scrupulously maintains its editorial independence and aims to promote access to information, freedom of expression, press freedom, and media pluralism in Palestine.

Does she like Rossini? &quot;Oh, I&apos;ll drink anything.&quot; Boom boom. Can you really get away with that, in this post-Office comedy era? It&apos;s a shame because Only Fools and Horses was wonderful in its day, and so much\u00a0of that joy came from the \u00adinterplay between Lyndhurst&apos;s \u00adRodders and David Jason&apos;s Del Boy, which is missing here.

Israel, itself a major but undeclared nuclear power, has been pushing for tougher sanctions against Iran and is wary of those who argue in favour of dialogue and negotiations. On Saturday the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, held a rare meeting with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Davos, Switzerland, and asked him to work &quot;in a serious and steadfast manner against Iran&apos;s nuclear armament&quot;. Peres told him: &quot;A nuclear weapon in the hands of a fanatical regime such as the one in Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but also to the entire world.&quot; The Israeli administration seems so far unconvinced by Washington&apos;s approach.

Recently, he has responded to the iPad; before that, he got mad because Chicago didn&apos;t get the Olympics, because of Facebook, because of the US bailout, and simply because he wanted to go to Burger King. These parodies use a scene from Downfall, the 2004 movie by Oliver Hirschbiegel \u2013 in the original, it&apos;s the moment that Hitler is told the war is truly lost \u2013 and are frequently taken down for copyright infringement on behalf of the movie&apos;s owner, Constantin Film. As of now, there are about 68 still up.  Hitler, of course, has been at this for quite a while now. But as the iPad video showed, millions of millions of users still think he is worth a click. So why does this Hitler meme seem to be so enduringly popular?  &quot;Until recently Hitler was demonised and portrayed not as human being but the devil himself,&quot; says Daniel Erk, a German critic whose Hitler blog on the left wing newspaper Taz is keeping track of the F\u00fchrer&apos;s appearances in popular culture and the media, from advertisements to Google requests and the surface of toast.  &quot;This is precisely why the Downfall meme became so incredibly popular over time: Hitler appeared in a different, more human way while he still remained the evil dictator. These competing images, the contrast between the great dictator and the little day-to-day issues, create a new and still provocative humour around Hitler. Any subject from arguing about parking lots in Tel Aviv to banal football issues can be attached.&quot; Politicians like Hillary Clinton or Gordon &quot;The BrownFall&quot; Brown have been portrayed as Hitler. And last year, a satirical video clip that supposedly depicts Hitler being enraged over the parking problems in Tel Aviv provoked some discussion. Yes, with Hitler you can still go too far, and even the meta-parodies that are around don&apos;t seem to stop him. However, here are some of the better ones:  1 Hitler&apos;s Reaction to the Oasis SplitStill clearly among the best parodies so far. Hitler even let his hair grow for the concert, and now the band splits!             2 No Twitter for HitlerOld, but one of the funnier ones: Hitler gets mad because Twitter is down, and he can&apos;t reach his 2,000 followers. And no, he doesn&apos;t want to give tumblr a try.             3 Hitler gets banned from Xbox LiveWith over 3.5 million views this is one of the most-watched Downfall parodies.             4 Hitler doesn&apos;t get MDMA on his pizzaNo funky house party for Hitler, and he can&apos;t keep the promise to his girlfriend             5 Hitler Reacts to Chelsea&apos;s Transfer BanBanned by Fifa from making transfers until January 2011, Hitler gets mad.

Club sources confirmed that Azougy personally negotiated this week&apos;s sales of the centre-half Younes Kaboul, to \u00adTottenham, for \u00a35m and the goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, to Stoke, for \u00a33.25m. Mark Jacob, the London solicitor who has been executive director at Portsmouth since the takeover by the Saudi Arabian businessman Ali al-Faraj, is understood to have refused to sign off the Begovic deal because he believed the club should have secured more for the outstanding 22-year-old. Jacob, club sources said, has become the latest at Portsmouth to consider resigning. Peter Storrie, the chief executive, has complained in recent weeks that he has not been involved in negotiating player sales; he is understood to have signed off the Begovic deal after Azougy negotiated the price. Azougy, a former lawyer in Israel, was convicted of fraud and deception offences in Tel Aviv in 2001, for which he served a five-month jail sentence, with 10 more months suspended. In 2002, he was disqualified by the Israel Bar Association from acting as a lawyer for 14 years after being found guilty of obstructing the course of justice by showing false documents to judges. As recently as last March, Azougy was fined, handed a suspended prison sentence, and did community service after pleading guilty to handing false documents to the Israeli stock exchange. The report of the 2001 case in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted the judge, David Rozen, describing Azougy as: &quot;A sophisticated lawyer willing to do anything to reach his own personal goals. He lied, cheated, used a forged document and stole money from his clients.&quot; Azougy was installed at Portsmouth last October to work on the club&apos;s finances after the takeover. Since then, he has declined interviews, but representatives of Faraj have described Azougy as a capable negotiator with expertise in insolvency situations. Under the Premier League&apos;s fit and proper person test, nobody convicted of dishonesty offences can act as a club director, but the league does not believe Azougy&apos;s position can be classed as that senior, so it is powerless to act. &quot;We have asked numerous times for clarification of Mr Azougy&apos;s role,&quot; a Premier League spokesman said. &quot;Each time the board has said he is a consultant on a short-term contract.&quot; The spokesman added that in regular meetings the Premier League holds with Portsmouth to clarify the club&apos;s parlous position, it insists Azougy must not be present. &quot;We are still actively pursuing the precise role Mr Azougy is fulfilling,&quot; he said, &quot;to ensure it does fall short of acting as a director or shadow director.&quot; The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, and secretary, Mike Foster, have agreed to meet representatives of the Portsmouth Supporters Trust and the fans&apos; SOS group this Friday to discuss the club&apos;s crisis. The trust wrote to Scudamore at the weekend calling on the league to take &quot;direct action&quot; and intervene in the running of the club, saying that if Pompey falls into liquidation after 112 years it would be &quot;a betrayal of generations of loyal supporters&quot;. Portsmouth are living hand to mouth as the new owners have failed to secure new investment, with the players and staff not paid on time this week for the fourth month in a row. The club faces a winding-up petition next Wednesday for around \u00a36m owed to Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs, although it has appealed against the VAT element of the bill, which the board hopes will at least delay the petition hearing. The Hong Kong businessman Balram Chainrai, who has links with the Israeli businessmen connected to Faraj, has loaned what the club said amounted to \u00a320m and has two mortgages over the club. One, registered on 6 October, gives Chainrai&apos;s company Portpin, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, security over Fratton Park. The other, registered on 7 January, secures for Portpin &quot;the whole of [Portmouth&apos;s] undertaking and all its property and assets&quot;. That means that if the club does fall into administration or liquidation, Chainrai will be able to take possession of the club itself, and Fratton Park, possibly leaving HMRC and the club&apos;s mounting list of other creditors unpaid. It is not clear whether the Premier League does have the power actually to take over a club, but it did withhold the January TV payment of \u00a37m so that other clubs owed money could be paid, including Chelsea, Tottenham (still short of instalments from when Portsmouth originally signed Kaboul in August 2008) and the French clubs Lens and Rennes. This week the league used portions of the Kaboul sale proceeds to pay directly Watford instalments for Tommy Smith and Mike Williamson, and Chelsea, again, to whom Portsmouth still owe part of the \u00a34m purchase price for Glen Johnson, signed in August 2007. All this comes just months after Faraj&apos;s takeover which was supposed to rescue Portsmouth from meltdown. When, in the summer, Alexandre Gaydamak, Portsmouth&apos;s former owner, sold the stricken club to the Dubai investor Sulaiman al-Fahim, Storrie declared himself &quot;shattered&quot; because he had been working with Faraj. Storrie described Faraj and the group around him as &quot;very, very rich people&quot; he had found &quot;with the help of [the Israeli agent] Pini Zahavi.&quot; Storrie said then: &quot;The people I had lined up would have taken the club on to a level you would not quite believe.&quot; Less than two months later, Faraj did buy the club from Fahim, who could not fund its haemorrhaging spending, but the level he has taken it to is not the one Storrie envisaged. Faraj, as Gaydamak&apos;s advisors explained back then, is no billionaire, but a self-made businessman of relatively modest wealth, who has never been to Fratton Park. His brother, Ahmed, invests in property in London, and has done deals with an Israeli lawyer, Yoram Yusepov, who is understood to have been the initial contact for Zahavi. The group was intending to borrow money from EFG, a private bank based in Mayfair, but failed to secure it, so turned instead to the loan from Chainrai, who has his mortgages as security. Although the group is said to be still searching for investment, and there has been talk of interested parties, they have not found further funding. Thus Pompey became the Premier League&apos;s most severe case of &quot;living the dream&quot; \u2013 West Ham under their Icelandic ownership possibly excepted \u2013 since Leeds collapsed in 2003. Portsmouth have failed to use their Premier League windfall or copious borrowings to expand Fratton Park, instead signing a team of stars for Harry Redknapp which a 20,000-seat stadium could not finance. They won the FA Cup, as recently as May 2008, then the banks wanted their money back, and Gaydamak said he could pump no further money in. Portsmouth plummeted, as quickly as that, from Wembley to winding-up petition, then hired a fraudster to sort it out.

Immoral in the use of force against civilians for political purposes. Unjustified because Israel had a political alternative to the use of force. The home-made Qassam rockets fired by Hamas militants from Gaza on Israeli towns were only the \u00adexcuse, not the reason for Operation Cast Lead. In June 2008, Egypt had \u00adbrokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement. \u00adContrary to Israeli propaganda, this was a success: the average number of rockets fired monthly from Gaza dropped from 179 to three. Yet on 4 November Israel violated the ceasefire by launching a raid into Gaza, killing six Hamas fighters. When Hamas \u00adretaliated, Israel seized the renewed rocket attacks as the \u00adexcuse for launching its insane offensive. If all Israel wanted was to protect its citizens from Qassam rockets, it only needed to \u00adobserve the ceasefire. While the war failed in its primary aim of regime change in Gaza, it left \u00adbehind a trail of death, devastation, \u00addestruction and indescribable human suffering. Israel lost 13 people, three in so-called friendly fire. The Palestinian death toll was 1,387, including 773 civilians (115 women and 300 children), and more than 5,300 people were injured. The \u00adentire population of 1.5 million was left traumatised. Across the Gaza Strip, 3,530 homes were completely \u00addestroyed, 2,850 severely damaged and 11,000 suffered structural damage. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, tending to the needs of four million Palestinian \u00adrefugees, stated that Gaza had been &quot;bombed back, not to the Stone Age, but to the mud age&quot;; its inhabitants \u00adreduced to building homes from mud after the fierce 22-day offensive. War crimes were committed and possibly even crimes against humanity, documented in horrific detail in Judge Richard Goldstone&apos;s report for the UN human rights council. The report \u00adcondemned both Israel and Hamas, but reserved its strongest criticism for Israel, accusing it of deliberately targeting and terrorising civilians in Gaza. The British government did not take part in the vote on the report, sending a signal to the hawks in Israel that they can continue to disregard the laws of war. Gordon Brown&apos;s 2007 appointment as a patron of the Jewish National Fund UK presumably played a part in the adoption of this \u00adpusillanimous position. One year on, the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated areas on earth, continues to teeter on the verge of a humanitarian disaster. Israel&apos;s \u00adillegal blockade of Gaza, in force since June 2007, restricts the flow not only of arms but also food, fuel and medical supplies to well below the minimum necessary for normal, everyday life. Reconstruction work has hardly begun because of the Israeli ban on bringing in cement and other building materials to Gaza. Thousands of families still live in the ruins of their former homes. Hospitals, health facilities, schools, government buildings and mosques cannot be rebuilt. Nor can the basic \u00adinfrastructure of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City&apos;s sewage disposal plant. Today, 80% of Gaza&apos;s population \u00adremain dependent on food aid, 43% are unemployed, and 70% live on less than $1 a day. Meanwhile, the so-called peace process cannot be revived because \u00adIsrael refuses to freeze settlement \u00adexpansion on the West Bank. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu recently agreed to a temporary freeze of 10 months, but this does not apply to the 3,000 pre-approved housing units to be built on the West Bank or to any part of Greater Jerusalem. It&apos;s like two men negotiating the division of a pizza while one continues to gobble it up. Politically, the disjunction between words and deeds persists. Appeals to the Israeli government to lift or relax the blockade of Gaza were not backed up by effective pressure or the threat of sanctions. In fact, the only effective pressure was applied by the US on the Egyptian government \u2013 to seal its border with Gaza. Egypt has its own reason for complying: Hamas is ideologically \u00adallied with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic opposition to the Egyptian regime. The tunnels under the border separating Egypt from the Gaza Strip bring food and material relief to the people under siege. Yet, under US \u00adsupervision and with the help of US army engineers, Egypt is building an 18-metre-deep underground steel wall to disrupt the tunnels and tighten the blockade. The wall of shame, as Egyptians call it, will complete the transformation of Gaza into an open-air prison. It is the cruellest example of the concerted \u00adIsraeli-Egyptian-US policy to isolate and prevent Hamas from leading the Palestinian struggle for self-determi\u00adnation. Hamas is habitually dismissed by its enemies as a purely terrorist \u00adorganisation. Yet no one can deny that it won a fair and free election in the West Bank as well as Gaza in January 2006. Moreover, once Hamas gained power through the ballot box, its \u00adleaders adopted a more pragmatic stand \u00adtowards Israel than that enshrined in its charter, repeatedly expressing its readiness to negotiate a long-term ceasefire. But there was no one to talk to on the Israeli side. Israel adamantly refused to recognise the Hamas-led government. The US and the European Union \u00adfollowed, \u00adresorting to economic \u00adsanctions in a vain attempt to turn the people against their elected leaders. This cannot \u00adpossibly bring \u00adsecurity or stability \u00adbecause it is based on the denial of the most \u00adelementary human rights of the people of Gaza and the collective political rights of the \u00adPalestinian people. Through its special relationship with the US and its staunch support for \u00adIsrael, the \u00adBritish government is implicated in this shameful policy. At present the British public is \u00adpreoccupied with Tony Blair and the war in Iraq. What is often \u00adoverlooked is that this was only one aspect of a disastrous British policy towards the Middle East, inaugurated by Blair, and which shows no sign of changing under his successor. One of Blair&apos;s arguments used to \u00adjustify the Iraq war was that it would help bring justice to the long-suffering Palestinians. In his House of Commons speech on 18 March 2003, he promised that action against Iraq would form part of a broader engagement with the problems of the Middle East. He even declared that resolving the Israeli-\u00adPalestinian dispute was as important to Middle East peace as removing Saddam Hussein from power. Yet by focusing international \u00adattention on Iraq, the war further \u00admarginalised the Palestinian question. To be fair, Blair persuaded the Quartet (a group consisting of the US, the UN, the EU and Russia) to issue the Roadmap in 2003, which called for the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel by the end of 2005. But President George Bush was not genuinely committed and only adopted it under pressure from his \u00adallies. Ariel Sharon, Israel&apos;s hard-line prime minister at the time, wrecked the plan by continuing to expand Israeli settlements on the West Bank. Could Blair really not have realised that for Bush the special relationship that \u00adcounted was the one with Israel? Every time Bush had to choose between Blair and Sharon, he chose Sharon. Israel&apos;s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in August 2005 was not a contribution to the Roadmap but an attempt to unilaterally redraw the borders of Greater Israel and part of a plan to \u00adentrench the occupation there. Yet in return for the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, Sharon extracted from the US a written agreement to Israel&apos;s \u00adretention of the major settlement blocs on the West Bank. Bush&apos;s support amounted to an abrupt reversal of US policy since 1967, which regarded the settlements as illegal and as an obstacle to peace. Blair publicly endorsed the pact, probably to preserve a united \u00adAnglo-American front at any price. It was the most egregious British \u00adbetrayal of the Palestinians since the Balfour Declaration of 1917. In July 2006, at the height of the savage Israeli onslaught on Lebanon, Blair opposed a security council \u00adresolution for an immediate and \u00adunconditional ceasefire: he wanted to give Israel an opportunity to destroy Hezbollah, the radical Shi&apos;ite religious-political movement. One year later, in June 2007, he resigned from office. That day he was appointed the Quartet&apos;s special envoy to Israel and the Palestinian Authority. His main sponsor was Bush and his blatant partisanship on behalf of Israel was probably considered a qualification. His appointment \u00adcoincided with the collapse of the \u00adPalestinian national unity government, the reassertion of Fatah rule in the West Bank and the violent seizure of power by Hamas in Gaza. Blair&apos;s main tasks were to mobilise international assistance for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, to promote good governance and the rule of law in the Palestinian territories, and to further Palestinian economic development. His broader mission, was &quot;to promote an end to the conflict in conformity with the Roadmap&quot;. On taking up his appointment, Blair said that: &quot;The absolute priority is to try to give effect to what is now the consensus across the international community \u2013 that the only way of bringing stability and peace to the \u00adMiddle East is a two-state solution.&quot; His appointment was received with great satisfaction by the Israelis and with utter dismay by the Arabs. In his two and a half years as special envoy, Blair has achieved remarkably little. True, Blair helped persuade the Israelis to reduce the number of West Bank checkpoints from 630 to 590; he helped to create employment oppor\u00adtunities; and he may have contributed to a slight improvement in living \u00adstandards in Palestine. But the Americans remained fixated on security rather than on economic development, and their policy remains skewed in favour of \u00adIsrael. Barack Obama made a promising start as \u00adpresident by insisting on a complete settlement freeze on the West Bank, but was compelled to back down, \u00addashing many of our high hopes. One reason for Blair&apos;s disappointing results is that he wears too many hats and cannot, as he promised, be &quot;someone who is on the ground spending 24/7 on the issue&quot;. Another reason is his &quot;West Bank first&quot; attitude \u2013 \u00adcontinuing the western policy of bolstering Fatah and propping up the ailing Palestinian Authority against Hamas. His lack of commitment to Gaza is all too evident. During the Gaza war, he did not call for a ceasefire. He has one standard for \u00adIsrael and one for its victims. His attitude to Gaza is to wait for change rather than risk \u00adincurring the displeasure of his American and \u00adIsraeli friends. As \u00adenvoy, Blair has been inside Gaza only twice; once to visit a UN school just \u00adbeyond the border and once to Gaza City. His project for sanitation in northern Gaza was never completed because he could not \u00adpersuade the Israelis to \u00adallow in the last small load of pipes needed. A growing group of western politicians has \u00adpublicly acknowledged the necessity of talking to Hamas if meaningful progress is to be achieved; Blair is not one of their number. Blair has totally failed to fulfil the \u00adofficial role of the envoy &quot;to promote an end to the conflict in conformity with the Roadmap&quot;, largely for reasons beyond his control. The most \u00adimportant of these is Israel&apos;s determination to perpetuate the isolation and the de-development of Gaza and deny the Palestinian people a small piece of land \u2013 22% of Mandate-era \u00adPalestine, to be precise \u2013 on which to live in freedom and dignity. It is a policy that Baruch Kimmerling, the late Israeli sociologist, named \u00ad&quot;politicide&quot; \u2013 the denial to the \u00adPalestinian people of any independent political existence in Palestine. Partly, however, Blair&apos;s failure is due to his own personal limitations; his \u00adinability to grasp that the fundamental issue in this tragic conflict is not Israeli security but Palestinian national rights, and that concerted and sustained \u00adinternational pressure is required to compel Israel to recognise these rights. The core issue cannot be avoided: there can be no settlement of the \u00adconflict without an end to the Israeli occupation. There is international consensus for a two-state solution, but Israel rejects it and Blair has been unable or unwilling to use the Quartet to enforce it. Blair&apos;s failure to stand up for Palestinian independence is precisely what endears him to the Israeli establishment. In February of last year, while the \u00adPalestinians in Gaza were still mourning their dead, Blair received the Dan David prize from Tel Aviv University as the &quot;laureate for the present time \u00addimension in the field of leadership&quot;.

This explains the anger and insult that Israelis feel when they watch themselves on the BBC or CNN. It can&apos;t possibly be us, they protest, the networks must be biased and pro-Arab. From the outside, Israel is defined by its everlasting conflict with its Arab neighbours, the Palestinians in particular. The vast majority of international news stories reflect this perception, depicting Israel as one-half of either war or peace talks. Occupation stories like Gaza under siege, new construction in West Bank settlements, or demolition of Palestinians&apos; homes in East Jerusalem, are prime-time stuff. Israel per se attracts little interest abroad, with its relatively small population of seven million. Think Denmark or Paraguay. Who bothers to cover its internal politics? Who would recognise its leaders&apos; names and faces? Thanks to the Middle East conflict, Israeli leaders have always been internationally recognised figures, and our political system is closely watched. Israelis define their country as a western democracy with an advanced high-tech economy, a bastion of innovation, modernity, and technological development in a backwards region. We see the conflict as a fact of life, like the weather to Englishmen. Most people are more excited about money, sex, real estate, and travel abroad. The media makes comparisons with America, Britain, or the OECD average, and not with our immediate neighbours Egypt, Jordan, Syria, or the Palestinian Authority. It wasn&apos;t always like that. When I was a little kid, the conflict was all around. Children&apos;s books described brave, good-looking Israeli heroes defeating ugly, ridiculous Arab villains. On Lag Ba&apos;omer, a holiday celebrated with bonfires, we used to burn effigies of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt&apos;s then-leader and our arch-enemy. Yasser Arafat&apos;s figure followed. Today, few kids would bother to express similar public hatred towards Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, or the Hezbollah leader, Hasan Nasrallah. The separation policy of the former prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who strove to isolate Israelis from the conflict through the Gaza pullout and the construction of the West Bank security barrier, paid off handsomely. The vast majority of Israelis, who live in and around Tel Aviv, don&apos;t interact with Palestinians, or even with Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Only a small number of conscripts and reservists, deployed across the barrier as part of their military service, would go there. To most Israelis, New York, London and even Thailand are closer to home than Palestinians towns like Nablus or Ramallah and their adjacent settlements, a mere 40-minute drive from downtown Tel Aviv. Occupation stories are barely reported in the Israeli media, which prefers to praise Israeli scientific, business, and cultural achievements or to chew on the latest political scandal. The &quot;demographic problem&quot; \u2013 namely, the Palestinian threat to demand &quot;one man, one vote&quot; and overwhelm Israel with an Arab majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean \u2013 is widely discussed in op-ed articles, but fails to scare Israelis. After all, how can you be defeated by invisible people? On Tuesday, defence minister Ehud Barak gave a dire public warning: &quot;As long as in this territory west of the Jordan River there is only one political entity called Israel it is going to be either non-Jewish, or non-democratic,&quot; he said. &quot;If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.&quot; Clear as they were, his words failed to stir public debate. First-time foreign visitors are often struck. They have heard of &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; and expect to see separate toilets and buses for Jews and Palestinians. Instead, when exposed to Tel Aviv&apos;s beaches and lively night spots, they are shocked. &quot;I thought it would be far more religious and conservative&quot; is a common visitor&apos;s perception. And they never see any Palestinians around, unless they bother to drive up the hills to find them. The government&apos;s PR machine tries to build on this sentiment, leading an effort to &quot;rebrand&quot; Israel away from the image of an unpleasant fortress. Bikini-clad models and high-tech entrepreneurs demonstrate the new, post-conflict, western-lookalike Israeli society. The underlying message to North American and European audiences is &quot;We are just like you&quot;. The Palestinians have no Bar Refaeli or Shai Agassi (the electric car innovator), both of whom spend most of their time outside Israel. A similar process happened in India. While Indians are still preoccupied with Pakistan, and despite the ongoing fighting in Kashmir and in India&apos;s cities, they define their country outside the sub-continental conflict. India today is an economic powerhouse and aspiring global power, not only a belligerent in an endless postcolonial conflict. If they can do it, why couldn&apos;t we? In Israel, the appearance of calm \u2013 especially in the past year, which has been the quietest security-wise in a decade \u2013 has important political ramifications. Operation Cast Lead in Gaza, with its ensuing allegations of Israeli war crimes, is seen here as a PR problem rather than as a moral or legal issue. The settlement debate is seen through the prism of Israeli-American relations, which most Israelis cherish. As a result, most Israelis are indifferent to the establishment of a Palestinian state. For several years, a stable two-thirds majority of Israelis have supported the idea in opinion surveys \u2013 while a similar majority doubted its possibility. They simply don&apos;t care, since they fail to see how an independent Palestine would make any change in Israelis&apos; lives. At best, it might reduce some of the international criticism of Israel; and even that is doubtful. Israelis believe that security will be achieved by force, rather than diplomacy. This attitude explains why the American effort to resume Israeli-Palestinian talks, despite ostensible majority support, fails to interest Israelis. It also explains why from the outside, Israel appears to be divorced from the reality of its occupation, and apathetic to peace. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-02-04T10:00:01Z", "title": "Israel's dual reality | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["The vast majority of Israelis, who live in and around Tel Aviv, don&apos;t interact with Palestinians, or even with Jewish settlers in the West Bank.", "To most Israelis, New York, London and even Thailand are closer to home than Palestinians towns like Nablus or Ramallah and their adjacent settlements, a mere 40-minute drive from downtown Tel Aviv.", "Instead, when exposed to Tel Aviv&apos;s beaches and lively night spots, they are shocked."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/04/israel-palestinian-territories-war-crimes"}, {"tags": ["Portsmouth", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "Portsmouth, FA Cup winners in May 2008 with a squad including Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch, Lassana Diarra, Sulley Muntari, Sol Campbell and Glen Johnson, are now in financial crisis. They face a winding-up petition in the high court on Wednesday for unpaid tax and, following a takeover this week, are under their fourth different overseas-based owner since the summer. This is a guide to the key characters and bewildering series of events which have unfolded during the crisis at Fratton Park. Why are Portsmouth in trouble?The club did not make enough money to pay the multimillion-pound transfer fees and high wages for the squad of star players assembled by a previous manager Harry Redknapp, who led them to the FA Cup win. During their six and a half years in the Premier League, Portsmouth have not expanded Fratton Park to accommodate more than 20,000 supporters. The overspending was funded with loans from Alexandre &quot;Sacha&quot; Gaydamak, who owned the club from 2006 until the start of this season, and with bank loans. However, as the costs grew and the recession hit, the banks demanded their money back, and Gaydamak decided he could no longer afford to fund the club. Almost the whole FA Cup-winning squad has been sold but the ongoing debts and costs, which included instalments still owing on players like Johnson and Muntari, are too much for the club. Why did Sacha Gaydamak decide to sell the club?Gaydamak has said he was financially hit by the recession and would sell the club to a buyer willing to fund the club&apos;s losses and keep it going, preferably in the Premier League. Gaydamak is owed money himself, although his advisers said that he wrote off \u00a313.5m of loans. Gaydamak&apos;s trust fund agreed to become directly liable, instead of the club, to Standard Bank, for around \u00a325m. The club owes that money now to Gaydamak&apos;s trust, not the banks, and together with other amounts owing to Gaydamak, owes him a total of \u00a333.5m. A \u00a39.5m instalment due to be repaid at the end of January was not met; the rest is due for repayment in stages by 2012. Gaydamak still owns the land around Fratton Park, although not the stadium itself. Who bought the club from Gaydamak?The Dubai-based businessman Sulaiman al-Fahim bought Pompey in August, paying Gaydamak just \u00a31, and promising to put \u00a35m into the club and find more money soon after that. However, Fahim failed to secure the further funding. Pompey&apos;s players were not paid their wages at the end of September, then the Premier League called in Fahim and told him no further delay would be acceptable. Who bought the club the second time?After 43 days Fahim sold 90% of the club to a company, Falcondrone, registered in the British Virgin Islands. The Premier League was told that a Saudi Arabian businessman, Ali al-Faraj, was the sole owner of Falcondrone. Who was involved with Ali al-Faraj?A number of people have been advising or working at Fratton Park since the Faraj takeover. Faraj himself was described as a businessman of &quot;moderate wealth&quot; by Gaydamak&apos;s advisers and he has never been to the club. Ahmed al-Faraj, Ali&apos;s brother, is based in London where he is a property investor and he has been involved in running Portsmouth and has attended matches. Yoram Yusepov, a lawyer who divides his time between Tel Aviv and London, and who has been involved in investments with Ahmed al-Faraj, has also been involved. Mark Jacob, a London solicitor specialising in property, and a football fan (he supports Spurs), became executive director at the club after the takeover. Daniel Azougy, an Israeli former lawyer who has been convicted in that country of fraud offences, was brought in to sort out the finances. The Premier League insisted that Azougy must not attend their regular meetings to receive updates about Pompey&apos;s situation. Why did the Faraj takeover not stabilise Portsmouth?Quite simply they did not have enough money. They had intended to borrow to invest in Pompey, thought to be up to \u00a330m, from the private bank EFG, but did not secure it. Instead they borrowed what was said to be \u00a317m from a Hong Kong-based businessman, Balram Chainrai. His company, Portpin, was granted a mortgage over Fratton Park and the assets of the club itself. Yet despite that money coming in, the club still owed millions, in tax and VAT to HM Revenue and Customs, to other clubs and to pay a wage bill which remains too high. In January the Premier League withheld from Portsmouth the \u00a37m it pays to all clubs from the league&apos;s TV deal and used it to pay other clubs to whom Pompey still owed money from signing players, including Spurs, Chelsea and the French clubs Lens and Rennes. Players still needed to be sold and in the January transfer window the club sold the defender Younes Kaboul, to Redknapp at Spurs, for \u00a35m, and the goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to Stoke for \u00a33.25m. Part of the fee for Kaboul was withheld by the Premier League to pay money Pompey still owed Chelsea for Glen Johnson, who was signed in August 2007, and Watford, for Tommy Smith and Mike Williamson. Why did Balram Chainrai, the club&apos;s fourth owner since the summer, take over this week?Chainrai told the Guardian on Wednesday this week that the \u00a317m he loaned the club was to be repaid in instalments but he had received no money and so he was taking control of the club. Portsmouth issued a statement on Thursday saying this had happened, because Chainrai had a right to do so if he were not paid, and confirmed that Chainrai had taken &quot;a controlling interest&quot; in Portsmouth. Who is involved with Chainrai at the club now?The club announced yesterday that Daniel Azougy &quot;will no longer be involved with any part of the club&quot;. The statement also highlighted that Peter Storrie, who has been the chief executive throughout this turbulent period, will remain in that position and &quot;continues to run the club&quot;. Is there any connection between Balram Chainrai, the new owner, and Sacha Gaydamak, the previous owner?There is a connection: Chainrai and his Israeli business partner Levi Kushnir, did a business deal with Gaydamak&apos;s father, Arkady, in 2008, which went sour. They successfully sued Arkady in Israel and were awarded around \u00a314.5m. Arkady Gaydamak is a deeply controversial figure; he was convicted by a French court in October of illegal arms trading to Angola in the 1990s and he has also been charged with money laundering in Israel. He has denied guilt for either set of offences and now lives in Moscow. Sacha Gaydamak has always said that his father had nothing to do with the ownership of Portsmouth and Sacha satisfied the Premier League on several occasions that he, Sacha, was the sole owner. Sacha has said it is a coincidence that Chainrai, with whom his father had a dispute, has become involved in Portsmouth. Sacha&apos;s advisors said he had not wanted to sell the club to Faraj in the summer partly because he believed Faraj was already connected to Chainrai. An associate of Chainrai told the Guardian on Thursday that Portsmouth came to the businessman&apos;s attention after he won the case against Arkady Gaydamak, and he thought a Premier League club would be a good investment. What happens to Portsmouth next?Chainrai has not said he will put further money into the club but that he will seek yet more owners, with the funds to clear the financial crisis. The club said it would be applying to HMRC to adjourn the winding-up hearing scheduled for Wednesday, &quot;to allow more time for the club to be stabilised and new owners found&quot;. It remains to be seen if HMRC will be willing to accept an adjournment, or the court to order one. If not, and if the club has not paid the outstanding tax, Portsmouth could finally be placed into administration.", "publicationDate": "2010-02-05T22:27:35Z", "title": "What's gone wrong at Portsmouth?

He has done the occasional interior; in Belgium he worked on a shopping centre with a roof like a lava flow; there is his own studio in London; and an unbuilt house, that was blocked by hostile neighbours. But nothing like Design Museum Holon, just outside Tel Aviv, which is ambitious, and highly visible. Unsurprisingly there was a certain nervousness at the opening on Monday. Successful designers who try their hands at making buildings have a way of coming badly unstuck. The scale is different, the relationship with space is different, and the materials are different. Would Arad, who has managed a remarkably creative twin-track career continually moving back and forth between mass production and one-offs, finally fall off the tightrope he has walked for so long in front of a home crowd in his native Israel? The museum manages, intriguingly, to be both rational and a bravura piece of architecture. The first thing that it has to do is hold its own in an unforgiving context of the concrete slabs that typify much contemporary building in Israel. But equally important, if it is to fulfil the ambition of Holon&apos;s mayor to make his city a centre for design, it has to work as a place for an exhibition programme. Arad has convincingly managed to do both, by creating what amounts to two distinct buildings. One is an inventive, intricate piece of sculpture, the other a logical and lucid set of gallery spaces, with one locked in the other like a M\u00f6bius strip. From the outside you see a tightly woven, sand-coloured dune of twisted steel ribbons. Once caught up in the whirling outer vortex, you find yourself in a protected inner courtyard, open to the strong Mediterranean sunshine that in turn leads into the galleries. There are two, both of them rectangular, and handsomely proportioned, with the larger of them toplit with natural light, filtered through carefully profiled concrete blades inside. This is too carefully controlled a piece of architecture to be reduced to the banal status of an icon. It works hard to do what is needed, but then perhaps that should not come as a surprise: designers know better than most the frustration of exhibition spaces in which overassertive architecture attempts to upstage content.

Plans were announced recently for a fully integrated mixed neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city, in a move which could herald a change in the way Jews and Arabs coexist in the Holy City. Elsewhere in Israel, many communities have embraced the idea of mixed living \u2013 such as in Nazareth and Jaffa \u2013 but Jerusalem has long remained a divided city, and the ostracism and isolation has done nothing to promote harmony between those on either side of the divide. When it comes to Jerusalem&apos;s set-up, east is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet \u2013 until now, that is. If the proposal for Tantur comes to fruition, a town of 800 housing units would be constructed, and further plans are slated for a similar community in the northern part of Jerusalem. While the mayor of Jerusalem has not vetoed the idea, he is said to prefer it to be sited elsewhere in the city, and those behind the project rate their chances of success as being 60% at best. However, several key Jewish and Palestinian academics and civil servants are backing the plan, and the scheme has won approval from Middle East envoy Tony Blair as well, which serves as a ringing endorsement, despite general scepticism about his role. While there are many hurdles in the path of the project, it would be a major disappointment were it to founder at this point, because mixed communities represent one of the best methods of bridging the gulf between the majority of Jews and Arabs in Israel and Palestine. I have experienced both sides of Israeli living during my five years in the country, and have seen first-hand the wildly differing effects of segregated and integrated neighbourhoods. My first four years were spent in the ultra-homogenous, insular German colony in West Jerusalem, which styles itself as a bastion of well-off, conservative Jewish suburbia. Located only a few miles from Bethlehem, the residents are nevertheless totally cut off from their Arab neighbours, thanks to the separation wall and checkpoints which hermetically seal south Jerusalem. The same divisions exist between west and east Jerusalem, where despite relatively free access between the two sides of the city, Arabs and Jews stick to their own territory (apart from the continually encroaching settlers in Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah and beyond). The upshot of such separation is a perpetual air of suspicion and distrust from both sides towards the other. In such a climate, it is little wonder that rapprochement remains so elusive. However, in parts of the country where Jews and Arabs live side by side, conditions are far more clement. Jaffa, where I have lived for the last year, is a case in point. The city is by no means a bed of roses, and tensions still abound over a variety of issues. However, for all that the set-up isn&apos;t perfect, it is the closest thing there is at present to a model of co-existence. Everyday contact with members of &quot;the other side&quot; is key to breaking down stereotypes and overcoming prejudices, and as such there is no substitute for first-hand experience of living in the same apartment blocks, shopping in the same supermarkets and walking the same streets. Coming from London, one of the most ethnically mixed cities on earth, cities like Jaffa and Haifa are nothing new, and certainly nothing of which to be apprehensive. However, for the average Jew or Arab in Israel, the level of scepticism that exists when it comes to such living arrangements speaks volumes about the historical segregation between the two groups. Cab drivers routinely turn down fares from Tel Aviv to Jaffa, fast food companies refuse to deliver south of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa border, and as soon as a non-resident hears I live in Jaffa, nine times out of 10 times I&apos;m met with the shocked response: &quot;But aren&apos;t you scared living with all those Arabs?&quot; For all the downside of Jaffa&apos;s continuing gentrification, one positive aspect is the amount of exposure that Tel Aviv Jews get to the mixed city on their doorstep now that Jaffa has become a magnet for diners, revellers and tourists alike. Likewise, Jaffa&apos;s Arab residents know far better than residents of Palestinian cities such as Ramallah and Jenin that not all Israelis are marauding settlers or gun-toting soldiers, and as such are far better placed to see the nuances in Israeli Jewish society. It would be over-simplistic and over-optimistic to assume that as soon as Jews and Arabs begin living together across the country, peace will automatically follow. Decades of each side mistreating the other and the inevitable resulting hostility and tension will not disappear overnight. But given that neither the Jews nor the Arabs will disappear either, there has to be a concerted effort to push past the current status quo and learn to live in some degree of harmony with each other. Proposed communities such as Tantur, and existing models such as Jaffa, must be given every opportunity to thrive; to do otherwise is to condemn yet another generation to a lifetime of division and distrust. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-02-08T12:01:43Z", "title": "Building a peaceful future | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Cab drivers routinely turn down fares from Tel Aviv to Jaffa, fast food companies refuse to deliver south of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa border, and as soon as a non-resident hears I live in Jaffa, nine times out of 10 times I&apos;m met with the shocked response: &quot;But aren&apos;t you scared living with all those Arabs?&quot; For all the downside of Jaffa&apos;s continuing gentrification, one positive aspect is the amount of exposure that Tel Aviv Jews get to the mixed city on their doorstep now that Jaffa has become a magnet for diners, revellers and tourists alike."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/08/jerusalem-housing-mixed-neighbourhoods"}, {"tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "Leaving Home At 8 9pm, Channel 4 From the tone of the narration, you might think this film is about children with terminal diseases.

To the extent the country makes the headlines, it is in the context of the Goldstone report on Operation Cast Lead, the latest outlandish statement of foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman or Israel&apos;s continuing occupation of large parts of the West Bank. Israel&apos;s negative image is reflected in events such as ambassador Michael Oren being heckled on University of California Irvine campus and deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon apparently being threatened during an appearance at Oxford University. Ultimately Israel&apos;s standing in the world hinges on one central factor: the continuing occupation of large parts of the West Bank and maintaining dozens of mini-settlements there. To protect these, Israel maintains hundreds of roadblocks that make Palestinian lives miserable. Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s government has been playing hide-and-seek with the international community about the cessation of construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. His only tangible achievement is to have survived his first year in office without a major crisis with the US while keeping his rightwing coalition intact. Looking at this small-time bickering and manoeuvring, most liberal Israelis experience a combination of dismay and often outright disgust. But, as Aluf Benn has pointed out recently, most Israelis feel politically quite apathetic \u2013 and Israel&apos;s liberals are hardly heard anymore. While I think the observation is correct, I disagree with his diagnosis: I think that the reason for the political apathy of Israel&apos;s citizenry is not lack of concern, but fear and hopelessness. In private conversation many Israelis are afraid that Israel will not survive in the long term; that at best it will remain in a state of low-intensity warfare, and at worst involved in bloody confrontations with its neighbours. The contrast between Israel&apos;s human, cultural, social, and economic reality and the paralysis maintained by its political class is stunning. First-time visitors from abroad are often surprised: based on what they see in the news they expect a backward, theocratic police state, and instead they find a vibrant, liberal country. They meet outgoing, curious, ambitious people who are open to the world. They see an economy based on entrepreneurship and a cultural scene that is dominated by liberal voices. No wonder they have difficulty connecting what they see to politicians like Lieberman or Eli Yishai whose attitude towards the world is run by deep suspicion, lack of civility and totally devoid of geopolitical sophistication, never mind moral sensitivity. Why then this contrast between Israel&apos;s human and cultural reality and its political class? Israel&apos;s liberal citizenry has all but disappeared from the political scene: Until the late 1990s, the square in Tel Aviv renamed after Yitzhak Rabin after his assassination was the scene of demonstrations that hundreds of thousands attended: against Sharon after the massacre of Sabra and Shatila; for peace \u2013 including the rally at which Rabin was murdered. In the last years Rabin Square has not seen any major demonstrations of Israel&apos;s liberals. What has changed, then? For outside observers it may be difficult to understand to what extent Israel&apos;s liberals were disempowered by the failure of the Camp David summit in 2000 and the ensuing second intifada. It is difficult to understand how traumatic the continuing shelling of southern Israel after the disengagement from the Gaza Strip has been. For many Israelis this meant that the promise of Israel&apos;s left, Peace Now, had been shattered. The prediction that if Israel would offer the two-state solution along the 1967 borders, Palestinians would accept it, turned out to be wrong. Israel&apos;s electorate never forgave the left for the failure of this prediction, and all but wiped it out in the last elections. Hence the paradox of Israel&apos;s current state of mind: two-thirds of the electorate consistently supports the two-state solution, but the vote goes ever more to the right. Israelis want the two-state solution, but are deeply afraid of implementing it. As a result they vote for politicians who address their fears rather than for those who offer hope \u2013 because they feel there is no hope they can believe in. These politicians, in turn, do everything to further isolate Israel with often boorish behaviour, thus reinforcing Israelis&apos; fears that they can depend only on military force for survival. The result is a form of moral numbness, in which criticism is shrugged off as another one of the relentless attacks on Israel. Is there a potential comeback for Israel&apos;s liberal wing? I wish I had a hopeful conclusion, but recent developments are making me ever more pessimistic. Tsipi Livni, who looked like a ray of hope, is having trouble keeping her Kadima party together. Labour leader and defence minister Ehud Barak has taken the last bit of credibility from the Labour party; and the left-leaning Meretz party has become a defunct fig-leaf without any relevance. And while I tend to think that Netanyahu has made a strategic choice for the two-state solution, there is no way he can implement it with his current coalition. The only short-term scenario that could initiate some change would be for Netanyahu to sever his ties with Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beiteinu party and to form a government together with Kadima based on an unequivocal acceptance of the two-state solution and immediate dismantling of isolated settlements. For the time being the vibrant, creative and liberal Israel that I know continues to express itself in literature, film and music; it continues to work through countless NGOs devoted to causes ranging from supporting Palestinian mental health institutions to ecological initiatives; its creative energies are felt daily in academia and the thriving world of Israeli startups.

But even the lifestyles of Her Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad are to be curtailed by the government&apos;s drive to reduce its contribution to carbon emissions. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff have been asked to downgrade flights to economy class \u2013 even for the top men and women and their families. The shift from wider seats and more legroom to what is unaffectionately known as &quot;cattle class&quot;, is part of the FCO&apos;s plan of action after joining the 10:10 climate change campaign. Like more than 61,000 other members, the government department has pledged to reduce carbon emissions from its 291 posts around the world by 10% in 2010. In common with other individuals and organisations, including three other government departments, it will turn down heating and air conditioning, switch to eco-friendly vehicles, and try to use video-conferencing to replace one in ten flights. Staff overseas are also being encouraged to take their own initiative: in Portugal, our man in Lisbon, ambassador Alex Ellis now cycles to work. The most uncomfortable change, however, might well be new rules that suggest staff should book economy seats on flights up to five hours \u2013 as far as Tel Aviv or Moscow \u2013 up from three previously. Staff and their families are also asked to take the smaller seats when flying on leave for journeys up to 10 hours \u2013 further than Washington or Delhi. &quot;Economy seats take up less room on a plane, and aviation emissions are calculated by the amount of room a person takes up on a plane,&quot; explained a government spokesman. &quot;Therefore business or first class have higher emissions than economy.&quot; Foreign Office staff are not entitled to fly first class. Union representatives said staff had been told the proposed new flying rules were to cut costs, and there will be concerns that the FCO said it did not have data on total flights last year, nor a breakdown of economy and business tickets. However, Eugenie Harvey, 10:10&apos;s director, said the department and the foreign secretary, David Miliband, were very committed to the campaign, and the fact that changes could also save money should be celebrated. &quot;This whole challenge is about looking for the gaps and cracks, the little things that go unnoticed, and see how we can start with some of those to chip at this much bigger ambition [to cut global emissions],&quot; added Harvey. The carbon management company, Carbon Planet, tells travellers there is little difference between business and economy for short-haul flights, over 1,000 km business seats are allocated about 50% more carbon than economy, and for long-haul destinations such as to Asia the difference can be three times. Miliband said: &quot;By signing up to and delivering on the 10:10 commitments, the FCO will signal its determination to play its own part in turning Copenhagen&apos;s intent into the reality of a low-carbon future.&quot; The Foreign Office is the fourth government department to join 10:10, which is supported by the Guardian. The other three departments are Energy and Climate Change, headed by the foreign secretary&apos;s brother, Ed Miliband; International Development; and Customs. Last week it was revealed total government emissions rose by more than 6% in 2008, despite a 2% drop nationally, blamed on the economic recession. Last October, a move to force the government to join the 10:10 climate campaign and cut its own emissions by 10% in 2010 was defeated in the Commons.

The Israeli ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office to &quot;share information&quot; about the assassins&apos; use of identities stolen from six British citizens living in Israel, as part of the meticulously orchestrated assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Britain has stopped short of accusing Israel of involvement, but to signal its displeasure, the Foreign Office ignored an Israeli plea to keep the summons secret. &quot;Relations were in the freezer before this. They are in the deep freeze now,&quot; an official told the Guardian. Gordon Brown yesterday launched an investigation into the use of the fake passports, which will be led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). The British embassy in Tel Aviv is also contacting the British nationals affected in the plot, &quot;and stands ready to provide them with the support that they need&quot;, the Foreign Office said in a statement last night. &quot;The British passport is an important part of being British and we have to make sure everything is done to protect it,&quot; Brown told LBC Radio yesterday. Israel&apos;s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, insisted there was no proof that the Mossad was involved in Mabhouh&apos;s killing in a Dubai hotel last month, but added that Israel had a &quot;policy of ambiguity&quot; on intelligence matters. However, there were calls in Israel for an internal government inquiry into whether the Mossad was responsible for identity theft from dual nationals, and criticism of its chief, Meir Dagan, for what critics described as a clumsy operation that risked alienating European allies. &quot;What began as a heart attack turned out to be an assassination, which led to a probe, which turned into the current passport affair,&quot; a columnist, Yoav Limor, wrote in Israel Hayom, a pro-government newspaper. &quot;It is doubtful whether this is the end of the affair.&quot; Israel&apos;s ambassador to London, Ron Prosor, will meet Peter Ricketts, head of the diplomatic service and the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office. Yesterday more details emerged about the assassination plot: \u2022 The Guardian learned that a key Hamas security official is under arrest in Syria on suspicion of having helped the assassins identify Mabhouh as their target. \u2022 Reports that the hit squad could have been bigger than the 11 suspects named by the Dubai police appear to have been confirmed by surveillance pictures showing other possible accomplices, including a second woman. \u2022 Authorities in Vienna have begun an investigation into whether Austria was used as a logistical hub for the operation, after seven of the mobile phones used by the killers had Austrian SIM cards. \u2022 Three of the killers entered Dubai with forged Irish passports that had numbers lifted from legitimate travel documents. It is not the first British-Israeli row over the misuse of British passports. British officials are particularly angry because the Israeli government pledged that there would be no repeat of an incident in 1987, in which Mossad agents acquired and tampered with British passports. Lieberman said he believed that relations with Britain would not be damaged. &quot;I think Britain recognises that Israel is a responsible country and that our security activity is conducted according to very clear, cautious and responsible rules of the game. Therefore we have no cause for concern,&quot; he said. However, the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, welcomed the decision to confront the Israeli government directly. He said: &quot;If the Israeli government was party to behaviour of this kind it would be a serious violation of trust between nations.&quot; France yesterday also claimed that the French passport used by one of the assassins had been forged. A source close to the French intelligence services told Reuters a French passport which Dubai said had been used in the operation had a valid number but incorrect name. &quot;It was a very good fake,&quot; the source said. Hamas, meanwhile, vowed vengeance for Mabhouh&apos;s assassination. At a memorial rally in Gaza, Hamas militants vowed that the movement&apos;s armed wing, Izz-el Deen al-Qassam, &quot;will never rest until they reach his killers&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-02-18T01:34:00Z", "title": "UK calls in Israeli ambassador as Dubai killing row escalates", "sentences": ["The British embassy in Tel Aviv is also contacting the British nationals affected in the plot, &quot;and stands ready to provide them with the support that they need&quot;, the Foreign Office said in a statement last night."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/17/uk-israeli-ambassador-dubai-killing"}, {"tags": ["The Mossad", "Israel", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Hamas", "Dubai", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Interpol should help arrest the head of Mossad if Israel&apos;s spy agency was responsible for the killing of a Hamas commander in Dubai, the emirate&apos;s police chief said today.

International pressure intensified against Israel&apos;s spy service as official &quot;wanted&quot; notices were released for the suspected team of Israeli secret agents accused of participating in the assassination. The faces of an 11-strong alleged hit squad appeared on the Interpol website this morning, 48 hours after authorities in the United Arab Emirates issued arrest warrants for the killing last month of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Their offences are listed as &quot;crimes against life and health&quot;. The group stands accused of entering the emirate state using forged or stolen European identities, murdering the militant in his hotel and then fleeing the country on 19 January. The red wanted notices are not international arrest warrants, but allow details of fugitives to be released worldwide with the request that the wanted person be arrested and extradited. Tamim said that the Dubai authorities were virtually certain that Mossad was behind the assassination of Mabhouh, as the incident threatened to turn into a diplomatic row between Israel and Britain over the use of false British passports. &quot;Our investigations reveal that Mossad is involved in the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. It is 99%, if not 100%, that Mossad is standing behind the murder,&quot; Tamim told the National newspaper in the United Arab Emirates. The Israeli ambassador, Ron Prosor, was at the Foreign Office this morning for a brief meeting to &quot;share information&quot; about the assassins&apos; use of identities stolen from six British citizens living in Israel, as part of the meticulously orchestrated assassination of Mabhouh at a luxury hotel last month. &quot;After receiving an invitation last night, I met with Sir Peter Ricketts, deputy-general of the British foreign minister,&quot; Prosor said after the meeting. &quot;Despite my willingness to co-operate with his request, I could not shed new light on the said matters.&quot; Britain has stopped short of accusing Israel of involvement, but to signal its displeasure the Foreign Office ignored an Israeli plea to keep the summons secret. &quot;Relations were in the freezer before this.

A UAE official said the number of suspects in the assassination had widened to at least 18. The official said the list included 11 people identified this week, two Palestinians in custody and five others. Two women were among the suspects. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz named the two Palestinians as Ahmad Hasnin, a Palestinian intelligence operative, and Anwar Shekhaiber, an employee of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. They were arrested in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and extradited to Dubai. Both worked for a property company in Dubai belonging to a senior official of Fatah, the political faction headed by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, the paper reported.

When police arrested him, he claimed to be an agent of the Mossad secret service taking part in a training exercise: his story turned out to be true \u2013 though the bomb was a fake. No comment was forthcoming from the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office, which formally speaks for \u2013 but invariably says nothing about \u2013 the country&apos;s world-famous espionage organisation. The bungling bomber was just a brief item on that evening&apos;s local TV news. There was, however, a far bigger story \u2013 one that echoed across the globe \u2013 two years ago this week, when a bomb in a Pajero jeep in Damascus decapitated a man named Imad Mughniyeh. Mughniyeh was the military leader of Lebanon&apos;s Shia movement Hizbullah, an ally of Iran, and was wanted by the US, France and half a dozen other countries. Israel never went beyond cryptic nodding and winking about that killing in the heart of the Syrian capital, but it is widely believed to have been one of its most daring and sophisticated clandestine operations. The Mossad, like other intelligence services, tends to attract attention only when something goes wrong, or when it boasts a spectacular success and wants to send a warning signal to its enemies. Last month&apos;s assassination of a senior Hamas official in Dubai, now at the centre of a white-hot diplomatic row between Israel and Britain, is a curious mixture of both. With its cloned foreign passports, multiple disguises, state-of-the-art communications and the murder of alleged arms smuggler Mahmoud al-Mabhouh \u2013 one of the few elements of the plot that was not captured on the emirate&apos;s CCTV cameras \u2013 it is a riveting tale of professional chutzpah, violence and cold calculation. And with the Palestinian Islamist movement now vowing to take revenge, it seems grimly certain that it will bring more bloodshed in its wake. The images from Dubai follow the biblical injunction (and the Mossad&apos;s old motto):&quot;By way of deception thou shalt make war.&quot; The agency&apos;s job, its website explains more prosaically, is to &quot;collect information, analyse intelligence and perform special covert operations beyond [Israel&apos;s] borders.&quot; Founded in 1948 along with the new Jewish state, the Mossad largely stayed in the shadows in its early years. Yitzhak Shamir, a former Stern Gang terrorist and future prime minister, ran operations targeting German scientists who were helping Nasser&apos;s Egypt build rockets \u2013 foreshadowing later Israeli campaigns to disrupt Iraqi and (continuing) Iranian attempts to acquire nuclear and other weapons. The Mossad&apos;s most celebrated exploits included the abduction of the fugitive Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, who was later tried and hanged in Israel. Others were organising the defection of an Iraqi pilot who flew his MiG-21 to Israel, and support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels against Baghdad. Military secrets acquired by Elie Cohen, the infamous spy who penetrated the Syrian leadership, helped Israel conquer the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war. It was after that that the service&apos;s role expanded to fight the Palestinians, who had been galvanised under Yasser Arafat into resisting Israel in the newly occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The 1970s saw the so-called &quot;war of the spooks&quot; with Mossad officers, operating under diplomatic cover abroad, recruiting and running informants in Fatah and other Palestinian groups. Baruch Cohen, an Arabic speaker on loan to the Mossad from the Shin Bet internal security service, was shot in a Madrid cafe by his own agent. Bassam Abu Sharif, of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was badly disfigured by a Mossad parcel bomb sent to him in Beirut. Steven Spielberg&apos;s 2006 film Munich helped mythologise the Mossad&apos;s hunt for the Black September terrorists who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. Eleven of them were eliminated in killings across Europe, culminating in the small Norwegian town of Lillehammer, where a Moroccan waiter was mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh, the Munich plot&apos;s mastermind. Salameh was eventually killed by a car bomb in Beirut in 1979 \u2013 the sort of incident that made Lebanese and Palestinians sit up and notice last year&apos;s botched training episode in Tel Aviv. Some details of the assassination of Mabhouh last month echo elements of the campaign against Black September \u2013 which ended with the catastrophic arrest of five Mossad agents. Sylvia Raphael, a South African-born Christian with a Jewish father, was sentenced to five years in a Norwegian prison (of which she served slightly over a year); she may have been among the young Europeans in Israel who were discreetly asked, in nondescript offices in Tel Aviv, if they wished to volunteer for sensitive work involving Israel&apos;s security. Other agents who had been exposed had to be recalled, safe houses abandoned, phone numbers changed and operational methods modified. Over the years, the Mossad&apos;s image has been badly tarnished at home as well as abroad. It was blamed in part for failing to get wind of Egyptian-Syrian plans for the devastating attack that launched the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Critics wondered whether the spies had got their priorities right by focusing on hunting down Palestinian gunmen in the back alleys of European cities, when they should have been stealing secrets in Cairo and Damascus. The Mossad also played a significant, though still little-known, role in the covert supply of arms to Ayatollah Khomeini&apos;s Iran to help fight Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq, as part of the Iran-Contra scandal during Ronald Reagan&apos;s presidency. It has, in addition, suffered occasional blows from its own disgruntled employees. In 1990, a Canadian-born former officer called Victor Ostrovsky blew the whistle on its internal organisation, training and methods, revealing codenames including &quot;Kidon&quot; (bayonet), the unit in charge of assassinations. An official smear campaign failed to stop Ostrovsky&apos;s book, so the agency kept quiet when another ostensibly inside account came out in 2007. It described the use of shortwave radios for sending encoded transmissions, operations in Iran for collecting soil samples, and joint operations with the CIA against Hezbollah. But the worst own goal came in 1997, during Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s first term as prime minister. Mossad agents tried but failed to assassinate Khaled Mash&apos;al \u2013 the same Hamas leader who is now warning of retaliation for Mabhouh&apos;s murder \u2013 by injecting poison into his ear in Amman, Jordan. Using forged Canadian passports, they fled to the Israeli embassy, triggering outrage and a huge diplomatic crisis with Jordan. Danny Yatom, the then Mossad chief, was forced to quit. Ephraim Halevy, a quietly spoken former Londoner, was brought back from retirement to clear up the mess. The Dubai assassination, however, may yet turn out to be far more damaging \u2013 not least because the political and diplomatic context has changed in the last decade. Israel&apos;s reputation has suffered an unprecedented battering, reaching a new low during last year&apos;s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. &quot;In the current climate, the traces left behind in Dubai are likely to lead to very serious harm to Israel&apos;s international standing,&quot; the former diplomat Alon Liel commented yesterday. Even though Israel is maintaining its traditional policy of &quot;ambiguity&quot; about clandestine operations, refusing to confirm or deny any involvement in Dubai, nobody in the world seems to seriously question it. That includes almost all Israeli commentators, who are bound by the rules of military censorship in a small and talkative country where secrets are often quite widely known. It would be surprising if a key part of this extraordinary story did not turn out to be the role played by Palestinians. It is still Mossad practice to recruit double agents, just as it was with the PLO back in the 1970s. News of the arrest in Damascus of another senior Hamas operative \u2013 though denied by Mash&apos;al \u2013 seems to point in this direction. Two other Palestinians extradited from Jordan to Dubai are members of the Hamas armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam brigades, suggesting treachery may indeed have been involved. Previous assassinations have involved a Palestinian agent identifying the target. Yossi Melman, the expert on intelligence for Israel&apos;s Haaretz newspaper, worries that, as before the 1973 war, the Israeli government may be getting it wrong by focusing on the wrong enemy \u2013 the Palestinians \u2013 instead of prioritising Iran and Hizbullah. &quot;The Mossad is not Murder Inc, like the Mafia; its goal is not to take vengeance on its enemies,&quot; he wrote this week. &quot;&apos;Special operations&apos; like the assassination in Dubai \u2013 if this indeed was a Mossad operation \u2013 have always accounted for a relatively small proportion of its overall activity. Nevertheless, these are the operations that give the organisation its halo, its shining image. This is ultimately liable to blind its own ranks, cause them to become intoxicated by their own success, and thus divert their attention from their primary mission.&quot; From an official Israeli point of view, the Mossad has an important job to do. Its reputation for ruthlessness and cunning remains a powerful asset, prompting what sometimes sounds like grudging admiration as well as loathing in the Arab world \u2013 where a predisposition for conspiracy theories boosts the effect of the disinformation and psychological warfare at which the Israelis are said to excel. The government&apos;s official narrative, of course, is that Hamas is a terrorist organisation that pioneered horrific suicide bombings, fired thousands of rockets at Israeli civilian targets and \u2013 despite occasional signs of pragmatism or readiness for a temporary truce or prisoner swap \u2013 remains dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. It refuses to admit that its ever-expanding West Bank settlements remains a significant barrier to peace. In western countries, including Britain, there was widespread anger at the 1,400 Palestinian casualties of the Gaza war. Barack Obama has declared the occupation &quot;intolerable&quot;. Netanyahu heads the most rightwing coalition in Israel&apos;s history; his famous quip that the Middle East is a &quot;tough neighbourhood&quot; no longer seems to justify playing dirty. Yet Israelis, and not just those on the right, worry that their very existence as an independent state is being de-legitimised. And, judging by the jobs section of the Mossad website, there are still plenty of opportunities for Israel&apos;s wannabe spies: challenging positions are available for researchers, analysts, security officers, codebreakers and other technical work. Speakers of Arabic and Persian are invited to apply to be intelligence officers.The work involves travel abroad and a &quot;young and unconventional&quot; environment. It is a novelty of this episode that ordinary Israeli citizens are angry that their identities appear to have been stolen by their own government&apos;s secret servants \u2013 one reason why the Mossad chief Meir Dagan may find his days are numbered. But it is hard not to detect an undercurrent of popular admiration for the killers of Mabhouh. The day after the sensational CCTV images and passport photos were shown, the Israeli tennis champion Shahar Pe&apos;er reached the quarter-finals of a major international competition in the emirate. &quot;Another successful operation in Dubai,&quot; the Ynet website headlined its story. Or Kashti, Haaretz&apos;s education correspondent, did not have his passport cloned, but he does bear a striking resemblance to the hit-squad member named as Kevin Daveron. &quot;My mum rang and asked gently if I&apos;d been abroad recently,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Friends asked me why I hadn&apos;t brought back any cigarettes from the duty free shop in Dubai. I thought I sensed admiring glances in the street. &apos;Well done,&apos; said an elderly woman who came up to me in the supermarket and clapped me the shoulder. &apos;You showed those Arabs.&apos;&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 24 and 25 February 2010.

British government sources dismissed as &quot;nonsense&quot; a report claiming the Israeli secret service had given the UK advanced warning of possible complications arising from the illicit use of British passports in an unspecified &quot;overseas operation&quot; \u2013 the murder of the Hamas commander \u00adMahmoud al-Mabhouh. Officials complained of misleading briefing, apparently by pro-Israeli sources, reflected in a report in Friday&apos;s Daily Mail, which claimed that the Foreign Office was told, albeit only in general terms, of an impending assassination. The Mail story was widely reported today, both in Israel and across the Arab world. &quot;Any suggestion that the government knew anything about the murder before it happened is completely untrue, including the use of UK passports,&quot; insisted a FCO spokesman. On Thursday David Miliband, the foreign secretary, described the seeming fraudulent use of cloned British passports as &quot;outrageous.&quot; Miliband is to meet his Israeli counterpart, \u00ad\u00adAvigdor Lieberman, in Brussels on Monday. No UK action is likely until the completion of an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. But if Israeli official involvement were proved Britain would, at the very least, expect a public apology and guarantees that passports would not be stolen again. A more extreme option could be expelling diplomats from Israel&apos;s London embassy. Israeli media reports, meanwhile, told of the apparent disappearance of one of the six people with dual British-Israeli nationality whose names were released by the Dubai authorities as suspects in the killing of Mabhouh last month. The man, James Clarke, a Briton who converted to Judaism, was said by residents of Kibbutz Givat Ha&apos;shlosha, in central Israel, to have gone into hiding. Clarke originally went to the kibbutz as a volunteer, married an Israeli woman and served in the Israeli army as a bomb disposal expert. Neighbours told the Maariv newspaper that his family had asked them not to speak to the media. British embassy staff in Tel Aviv said they had tracked down five of the six and invited them to get new passports in place of the ones the Dubai police publicised. The names and numbers on the original British passports are the same as those used by the alleged agents. &quot;This step will reduce the risk that these people might be inadvertently detained,&quot; said an embassy spokesman, Raffi Shamir. Rival Palestinian factions, meanwhile, continued to trade accusations about involvement in the Dubai killing. Hamas named two Palestinians under arrest in the emirate as Anwar Sheibar and Ahmad Hassanein, former Gazan members of Fatah&apos;s security forces with links to the senior Fatah official Mohammed Dahlan. Al-Hayat, the London-based Arabic daily, quoted an unnamed Hamas official as saying that the two had provided logistical aid to the alleged Mossad team. Dahlan denied knowing the two men or involvement in the affair, saying Hamas was &quot;following mirages \u00adcreated by Israel&quot;. Avi Issacharoff, an Israeli commentator writing in Haaretz newspaper, called Mabhouh &quot;a central cog in the weapons smuggling trail \u2026 from Iran to Gaza&quot;, the assassination &quot;a mortal blow to Hamas&quot;. Interpol said Thursday it had issued &quot;red notices&quot; for the 11 suspects. Dubai&apos;s police chief has said he believes Israeli agents are responsible for the killing. The MossadThe Mossad is Israel&apos;s equivalent of the CIA or Britain&apos;s MI6. Its full name is the Institute for Espionage and Special Operations. The Hebrew word \u00ad&quot;mossad&quot; simply means &quot;institute&quot;, so it has come to be known as &quot;the Mossad&quot;. The definite article distinguishes it from other more mundane Israeli institutes. Meir Dagan, the Mossad&apos;s director for the past seven years, says on its website: &quot;People enrolling in the Mossad join generations of anonymous and dedicated fighters and intelligence officers who are loyal and devoted to their people and country.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-02-19T20:18:35Z", "title": "Britain denies any advance warning of plan to murder Hamas leader", "sentences": ["British embassy staff in Tel Aviv said they had tracked down five of the six and invited them to get new passports in place of the ones the Dubai police publicised."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/19/britain-denies-knowledge-hamas-leader"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Hamas", "The Mossad"], "article": "A striking advertisement appeared in several Israeli newspapers recently. It depicted Professor Naomi Chazan, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and respected political scientist, wearing a horn strapped to her forehead. It was the latest offensive in a campaign against the New Israel Fund, of which she is president. Its apparent crime: financing Israeli human rights groups who challenge violations by their country&apos;s government and security forces and whose tenacious questioning, you might think, would be hailed a pillar of the vibrant democracy Israel insists it is. Instead, the fund is derided as &quot;anti-Israel&quot;. Living here for the past four years, it is hard for me to escape the sense that there is a new climate in Israel, one in which dissent is marginalised and any criticism from abroad robustly shouted down. In part, it is the result of the election of a staunchly right-wing coalition government. It also plays on a sense long shared by many Israelis that they are embattled, misunderstood and find themselves in an increasingly unsympathetic world. Look at the response in the past week to the extraordinary unravelling of the assassination in Dubai of a Hamas militant. Most voices in Israel have been defiant, with a proud wink and a nod to the much-vaunted secret service, the Mossad, and strikingly little sympathy for those seven, fearful Israeli citizens who had their identities stolen for use by a brazen hit squad. Israeli officials seem unruffled by the anger in the British, Irish, French and German governments, whose passports have been forged to enable a high-profile extra-judicial killing in which the Mossad is the prime suspect. Take the new hardline approach of the Israeli foreign ministry. Last month Danny Ayalon, the deputy foreign minister, called in the Turkish ambassador for a diplomatic dressing-down over a Turkish television show. It turned into a public humiliation when he sat the ambassador before him on a low sofa and egged on the camera crews to highlight his guest&apos;s discomfort. That required two apologies to avert a full-blown diplomatic crisis. Then in a speech last week Ayalon compared the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, one of the most moderate of all Palestinian leaders, to the Taliban. The next day Ayalon refused to meet a delegation of US congressmen simply because they had travelled with J Street, a new American lobby group which is &quot;pro-Israel, pro-peace&quot;. It was, said Congressman William Delahunt, &quot;an inappropriate way to treat elected representatives of Israel&apos;s closest ally&quot;. When the Obama administration demanded Israel halt all settlement construction as a prelude to peace talks with the Palestinians last year, the Israeli government simply refused. In the end, it offered only a partial, limited curb, but construction continues. As a result, Abbas is now profoundly, perhaps fatally, weakened. The prospect of a just, conflict-ending, two-state peace agreement has almost gone. In my time here, Israel has fought two major wars \u2013 in Lebanon and Gaza \u2013 which killed more than 2,500 Lebanese and Palestinians and about 170 Israelis. Most Israelis thought the wars were justified acts of self-defence. However, particularly after Gaza, the international community began to disagree. And of this, Israelis are acutely aware. Last month, the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, listed the &quot;Goldstone effect&quot; as one of Israel&apos;s top three security challenges. It was a reference to the highly critical UN report authored by the South African judge Richard Goldstone which called on Israel and Hamas to investigate what he found to be credible evidence of war crimes during the Gaza war. Israel&apos;s approach has been to refuse all participation in the Goldstone inquiry \u2013 not even allowing the judge himself into Israel \u2013 and to see all the criticism and legal challenges that have followed as a new existential threat, something Netanyahu last week described as &quot;lawfare&quot;. In other words, legal challenges are now to be regarded as just as unconscionable as militant violence. It is what one Israeli thinktank, the Reut Institute, called the &quot;de-legitimisation network&quot;, which &quot;operates in the international arena in order to negate Israel&apos;s right to exist and includes individuals and organisations in the west, which are catalysed by the radical left&quot;. But now I have interviewed hundreds of Israelis, from professors to anarchists, generals to refuseniks, settlers to peace activists, Jews and Arabs, and the Israel I have seen is not formed of the one overarching narrative its government would impose. Scratch beneath the surface and there are people asking awkward questions. Sometimes it is just a hint of disagreement. When I asked one professor last week about the Dubai assassination, he said Israel would be better off making peace with Syria and the Palestinians than killing terrorists. This month, Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister and no dove, warned that failing to reach a peace deal risked creating an &quot;apartheid&quot; regime that ruled over millions of stateless, voteless Palestinians. True, it is a far cry from the past when the Israeli left was a significant force. Who now remembers the extraordinary moment in September 1982 when 300,000 Israelis stood in a Tel Aviv square to protest at their government&apos;s complicity in the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps? Or the Four Mothers&apos; movement which in the late 1990s did so much to precipitate Israel&apos;s withdrawal from that bitter 18-year occupation in Lebanon? But even as recently as 2006, after another Lebanon war, I was among a Tel Aviv crowd that heard the novelist David Grossman deliver an impassioned denouncement of Israel&apos;s &quot;hollow&quot; leadership and call for Israel to talk to the Palestinians and &quot;acknowledge their ongoing suffering&quot;. And there is Meron Benvenisti, the former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, who argues that Israel and the occupied territories are already a &quot;de facto bi-national regime&quot;. Sometimes the questioning comes from the most unexpected places. Breaking the Silence, one of the groups supported by the New Israel Fund, is an organisation of former Israeli combat soldiers who want a public debate about the &quot;moral price&quot; paid by Israeli society for the occupation. They gather testimony from Israeli soldiers about their experiences, and it is hard to think of a group of people less anti-Israel than Israeli soldiers. But read their most recent report, containing the stories of dozens of female soldiers. A lieutenant, posted in the Gaza Strip with the education corps, says: &quot;The truth is that I only confronted it in retrospect, after leaving: suddenly I realised to what extent I had not been a human being out there ... It&apos;s like a movie with a lot of death around you, an unreasonable reality, with soldiers doing inhuman things to others and to themselves.&quot; A sergeant from the Nahal unit: &quot;I knew I was not real, I knew that something here was not right. If I pass a seated person and spit at him, and call him a terrorist because I&apos;ve decided he&apos;s a terrorist, then something here is just not right. And that&apos;s what I tell everyone: come take a look at the blood of someone who&apos;s dead, it&apos;s not right.&quot; Then there is the minority prepared to come out and protest. Friday marked the fifth anniversary of the demonstrations in the village of Bil&apos;in against the West Bank barrier. More than two years ago, even Israel&apos;s supreme court ordered the state to re-route the fence and return much of the land lost by the village. It has still not happened. In recent weeks another regular protest has begun in Sheikh Jarrah, the scene of Palestinian evictions and Israeli settler expansion in east Jerusalem. At first it was met with a heavy-handed police crackdown, in which several peaceful protesters were arrested until the courts came to their defence. The crowd on Friday was small, a few hundred perhaps, but a mixture of old leftists, many academics among them, and a younger generation. Standing in the fading winter sun was Avraham Burg, former head of the Jewish Agency, who described angrily the segregation and discrimination he saw in today&apos;s Jerusalem. He said he was concerned about the new stifling of free speech, for which the best challenge, he thought, was continued popular dissent. &quot;Technical democracy is functioning,&quot; he said, &quot;but substantial liberties are not here.&quot; One of those arrested in the early protests was Hagai El-Ad, head of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, another group supported by the New Israel Fund. &quot;It is very easy to portray those who don&apos;t support the party line as enemies of the state, but I think that horribly weakens the state,&quot; he told me. &quot;If this society is finally to start changing course for the better, maybe it will be inspired by what is happening here.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-02-21T00:05:26Z", "title": "Brazen hardliners and ardent critics:  the Israel I have seen", "sentences": ["Who now remembers the extraordinary moment in September 1982 when 300,000 Israelis stood in a Tel Aviv square to protest at their government&apos;s complicity in the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps?", "But even as recently as 2006, after another Lebanon war, I was among a Tel Aviv crowd that heard the novelist David Grossman deliver an impassioned denouncement of Israel&apos;s &quot;hollow&quot; leadership and call for Israel to talk to the Palestinians and &quot;acknowledge their ongoing suffering&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/21/israel-mossad-foreign-anger-dubai-criticism"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israel&apos;s latest conscripts in the fight to improve the country&apos;s image have been unveiled: ordinary Israeli citizens. Armed only with a government-issued hasbara pamphlet and a winning smile, they will be sent to wage war with their detractors, in an effort to present Israel as a benign, democratic utopia whose only achilles heel is poor public relations. Into the breach has stepped a phalanx of Israeli spin doctors, who have devised a campaign in which they want all Israelis to participate when travelling overseas by &quot;telling about the beautiful Israel you know&quot;. To that end, three television commercials are currently being aired which mock the foreign media for its portrayal of the country. In one, a French newsreader is shown confusing Independence Day fireworks and flypasts with military action on Israel&apos;s streets. &quot;Fed up with how we&apos;re portrayed abroad?&quot; asks the advert. &quot;You can change the picture.&quot; The ministry for public diplomacy goes to great lengths instructing Israelis how to conduct themselves when engaged in PR on behalf of the state: first listen, then speak; maintain eye contact; use relaxed body language and tone; don&apos;t preach; ask questions; answer points raised; stick to two or three messages you want to convey; and maintain a sense of humour. If such rules are followed, the campaign literature suggests, there is a strong chance of winning over even the staunchest adversary. Hasbara is seen as a vital weapon in Israel&apos;s arsenal, both by government officials and ordinary Israelis. According to a poll, 85% of Israeli citizens want to help promote the country&apos;s image abroad, and in itself there is nothing wrong with taking such a patriotic stance. However, as has been seen time and again with Israel&apos;s attempts at hasbara, more often than not the campaigns are based more on witch-hunts and whitewashes than honest debate over the most thorny issues surrounding the state. Despite the sarcastic adverts broadcast by the public diplomacy ministry, what causes such consternation abroad is not whether Israelis use camels as their primary form of transport, or whether the average Israeli home is connected to gas supplies. Rather, Israel&apos;s flagrant and repeated violations of international law in its dealings with the Palestinians are key to most critics&apos; complaints \u2013 but, of course, this would prove a far harder nut for the spin doctors to crack. Instead, those who stand up to Israeli aggression in Gaza and the West Bank are belittled by the likes of Shimon Peres, who recently quipped:  &quot;There are millions of Indians who love us, a billion Chinese who love us, and millions of evangelicals, who love us. We have a problem with Sweden, but we&apos;re working on it.&quot;   Peres and the officials behind the latest PR drive are one side of the hasbara coin, trying to make light of Israel&apos;s image problem and implying that winning over their opponents is only a matter of patient, good-natured explanation. The other, darker side of Israeli hasbara is the relentless pursuit of anyone deemed a danger to the state, whether domestic dissidents or external critics. The recent savaging of Naomi Chazan and the New Israel Fund, as well as the gunning down of the Goldstone report, showed the true face behind the hasbara mask, in which politicians and press alike utilised the most vicious tactics available to ostensibly &quot;improve Israel&apos;s image in the eyes of the world&quot;. Huge amounts of public and private money is spent in such a fashion, funding quasi-governmental thinktanks and watchdog organisations dedicated to the McCarthyite hounding of media companies, diplomats or human rights groups labelled inimical to Israel. The same organisations are adept at dangling carrots as well as waving sticks, courting incoming reporters and statesmen with anything from dinner parties to helicopter rides in order to show a &quot;more positive public face of Israel ... [to help] protect Israel, reduce antisemitism and increase pride in Israel&quot;. But the facts that emerge from Gaza and the West Bank make it more and more difficult for the hasbaraniks to paper over the cracks, regardless of how many smiles they flash or glasses of wine they hand out. Even Israel&apos;s own leaders warn of a system of apartheid emerging if a settlement with the Palestinians is not hammered out soon, and for all that the spin doctors try to blow out the smoke, the underlying fire continues to burn. It is no surprise that Israel&apos;s leaders want to improve the country&apos;s image without having to take concrete measures in the form of concessions to the Palestinians. Likewise, it is not unusual that the same politicians seek to blame others for &quot;misunderstanding&quot; the situation rather than admitting that their own policies are highly questionable and unethical. However, to rope ordinary Israelis in by repeatedly telling them that anti-Israel sentiment abroad is irrational and baseless is both a futile and dishonest path to tread. Israel&apos;s image problem will only disappear when the core crimes committed in the name of the state cease, and the Palestinians are dealt with equitably. The Israeli public should demand their government spend all its energy on such fundamental affairs of state rather than worry about how many foreigners know that Maccabi Tel Aviv won the Euroleague in 1977.

Even so, the Israeli writer never imagined the political storm he would unleash with his best-selling novel, The House of Rajani. Hailed as one of his country&apos;s rising literary talents, Hilu came under fire when the book was first published in Hebrew two years ago \u2014 not because of its stylistic merits or otherwise but because of what some saw as its provocatively pro-Palestinian slant. Condemned bluntly by another Israeli novelist as &quot;anti-Zionist,&quot; it won the prestigious Sapir prize last summer, though it was quickly withdrawn amid accusations of bias by the judges. &quot;I feel as if the author is using language as a weapon against us,&quot; complained one Jewish reader. &quot;Disgusting,&quot; thundered another. &quot;How low will you stoop?&quot; Hilu, now promoting the English translation of The House of Rajani, makes no apology for what he calls his &quot;narrative of the other,&quot; which foreshadows the nakbah \u2013 the dispossession and flight of the Palestinians during Israel&apos;s 1948 war of independence. &quot;If I was a Palestinian author I&apos;d try to explain the significance of the Holocaust, but since I am a Jew I write about the suffering of the Palestinians \u2013 without necessarily comparing the two,&quot; explains Hilu, 38. &quot;Our history can be told in a different way.&quot; Older Israeli writers such as AB Yehoshua, Amos Oz and David Grossman have tackled different aspects of the conflict. But Hilu goes right back to the beginnings of what he identifies as an unmistakably colonialist enterprise, framed by the encounter between a young Arab and a Jewish immigrant in the first years of Zionist settlement in Ottoman Palestine. The year is 1895, the location Jaffa. The Polish-born hero \u2013 Isaac Luminsky \u2013 is a handsome agronomist who is sharply aware of the fertile soil of the promised land \u2013 and of the Arab peasants who till it. (In two years&apos; time Theodor Herzl will convene the first Zionist congress in his native Vienna). Salah Rajani is a sensitive Muslim boy who lives with his beautiful mother in a dilapidated mansion surrounded by orange groves. Luminsky covets \u2013 and conquers \u2013 both the woman and the land. Salah suffers from disturbing, apocalyptic visions about a disaster which is set to befall his people. He &quot;sees&quot; one man with a black eyepatch, another who is handsome and black-bearded, and a mannish woman, easily recognisable as Moshe Dayan, Herzl, and Golda Meir \u2013 Zionist and Israeli heroes who came to haunt the Palestinians. He sees a century or more into the future how the family estate has been stolen to build one of the icons of the modern Tel Aviv skyline, the glittering Azrieli Towers. Edward Said&apos;s Orientalism has been invoked by some to deconstruct the book&apos;s themes of sexual and colonial domination. But it is the menacing shadow of future catastrophe \u2013 the unique experience of the Palestinian nakbah \u2013 that gives the story both its dramatic force and contemporary relevance: moves are under way in Israel to stop official funding for nakbah commemoration. Politics apart, Hilu was widely praised for his recreation of an archaic Hebrew idiom in the early years of its revival from a language of liturgy to a spoken vernacular. The English translation has a Dickensian quality, and differs slightly from the original: Lubinsky is based on a real Jewish land agent whose litigious descendants disliked the negative way he was portrayed; Salah&apos;s &quot;real&quot; surname is that of a leading Palestinian family. A more striking omission is a map showing today&apos;s Tel Aviv, stripped back to the late 19th century sand dunes, Arab hamlets and orange groves that lie buried under the high-rise office blocks, hotels and parking lots of a 21st century metropolis, Israel&apos;s Manhattan-on-the-Med. Hilu says his own taboo-breaking views were partly moulded by his background: parents who immigrated to Israel from Syria and who did not share the dominant Ashkenazi (European Jewish) experience, with its emphasis on the Holocaust, and with no affinity for Arab life, language and culture. He also sees a link to the work of Israel&apos;s &quot;new&quot; historians who have de-bunked the old &quot;David versus Goliath&quot; narrative in recent years. This extraordinary book is set in the distant past but forms part of a red-hot contemporary debate, in Israel and beyond, about the origins and meaning of the world&apos;s most intractable conflict. Iconoclast he may be, but Hilu ponders carefully before answering his critics: &quot;Zionism does have a colonialist character and Jews did behave in condescending ways towards Arabs,&quot; he says. &quot;I am angry at our founding fathers for the damage that they did.&quot; Yet there are limits to his critique: &quot;I don&apos;t define myself as an anti-Zionist,&quot; he insists. &quot;I believe that facing up to the Palestinian past of Tel Aviv and of the Land of Israel in general and awareness of the Palestinian narrative actually strengthens Zionism because that&apos;s the only way to make peace with the Palestinians and our other Arab neighbours.&quot; The House of Rajani, by Alon Hilu, published by Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99", "publicationDate": "2010-02-24T14:06:06Z", "title": "Palestine's catastrophe foreshadowed", "sentences": ["He sees a century or more into the future how the family estate has been stolen to build one of the icons of the modern Tel Aviv skyline, the glittering Azrieli Towers.", "A more striking omission is a map showing today&apos;s Tel Aviv, stripped back to the late 19th century sand dunes, Arab hamlets and orange groves that lie buried under the high-rise office blocks, hotels and parking lots of a 21st century metropolis, Israel&apos;s Manhattan-on-the-Med.", "&quot;I believe that facing up to the Palestinian past of Tel Aviv and of the Land of Israel in general and awareness of the Palestinian narrative actually strengthens Zionism because that&apos;s the only way to make peace with the Palestinians and our other Arab neighbours.&quot; The House of Rajani, by Alon Hilu, published by Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/24/palestine-catastrophe-foreshadowed-ian-black"}, {"tags": ["Dubai", "Hamas", "The Mossad", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Dubai police today identified 15 more suspects wanted over the murder of a senior Hamas official in the Gulf emirate last month, including a further six who used British passports.

Several of the suspects flew to Hong Kong and two left the emirate by boat for Iran. Members of the team visited Dubai on at least four occasions before the murder, presumably for reconnaissance. Two Palestinians, reportedly linked to the western-backed Fatah movement, are in custody in Dubai after being handed over to the UAE by Jordan. Fatah and its Islamist rival Hamas, which is supported by Iran and Syria, have accused each other of betraying Mabhouh to Israel. Meanwhile, Israel&apos;s Channel 10 has reported that Syrian authorities have arrested an associate of Mabhouh named as Mohammed Nasser over suspected involvement in his killing. Nasser was reportedly in Dubai before the murder and was familiar with Mabhouh&apos;s schedule and whereabouts. Dubai&apos;s police chief, Dahi Khalfan al-Tamim, has said he believes the operation could not have been carried out without inside information on the victim&apos;s travel plans. As the diplomatic fall-out from the affair widened yesterday, Australia&apos;s government called in the Israeli ambassador to Canberra and its prime minister, Kevin Rudd, said his country&apos;s intelligence services were investigating.

By using a very broad definition of &quot;political activity&quot;, in reality, the measure will severely restrict a wide range of civil society organisations from carrying out their work. First, their tax-exempt status would be removed, which means that they would have to pay tax on donations. Even more damaging, government and private donors are generally legally restricted from paying taxes to a foreign government, so losing tax-exempt status would threaten these groups&apos; ability to receive donations entirely. Second, any representative of one of these groups appearing in public \u2013 even for a mere 30 seconds \u2013 will be legally bound to state, at the outset, that their organisation receives foreign funding. This would restrict freedom of speech. Third, members of such organisations will face the same legal constraints as the officials, a provision that would almost certainly produce a decline in support. In fact, the law is unnecessary as not-for-profit organisations already have to be completely transparent about their funding, mission and work. It will affect groups concerned with human rights, women&apos;s rights, the environment, migrants, peace and social change. They will be publicly delegitimised and suffer increased state monitoring. Their employees and members will face arrest, prosecution, fines and up to one year in jail. The law will legitimise a process that is already under way: a wave of assaults on Palestinian and Israeli activists and organisations opposing the occupation has already taken place. Non-violent Palestinian resistance has been quashed by Israeli security forces and Palestinian organisers and activists have faced night-time raids and arrests. A recent survey seems to suggest that there is the potential for a high degree of tolerance and approval of these actions, especially where human rights groups are concerned. The War and Peace Index of Tel Aviv University last week published results of a poll of Israel&apos;s Jewish residents, which showed that 57% agreed that, in the case of an external conflict, human rights are less important than the national security crisis. In such a climate, the incitement against human rights groups by rightwing columnists must surely find a receptive audience. Not to mention the reports and op-eds by rightwing NGOs and thinktanks. For example, Seth T Frantzman brands human rights activists as fifth columnists, by claiming they are taking EU money, constitute a European lobby and pursue the EU&apos;s alleged anti-Israel agenda. Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor bizarrely states that the way they operate is a &quot;grotesque distortion of democracy&quot;. The influential Reut Institute recently issued a report arguing that Israel is in existential danger of delegitimisation by radical groups abroad. The Netanyahu government already seems to have taken this message to heart and will no doubt see foreign-funded civil society groups as contributing to this process. Israel&apos;s democracy has never been perfect. Nor, for that matter, has the democracy of any other country. But over time, with the liberalisation of politics and the economy, a lively democratic culture began to develop. Nevertheless, the country&apos;s claim to be a beacon of western democratic norms has been fatally undermined by the state continuing to treat its Arab population as second-class citizens and by the absence of democratic rights for the Palestinians under its control in the occupied territories. The development of Israel&apos;s civil society institutions over the last few decades has come about partly as a response to this democratic deficit. It&apos;s hard to credit that a country that wants to be seen as on a par with EU members doesn&apos;t understand that it&apos;s a sign of democracy in practice to allow civil society organisations to operate freely. Restricting them in the way the new law proposes will thus undermine Israel&apos;s democracy. The political landscape, especially as reflected in the Knesset, is already unreceptive to alternative civil society views. The coalition ranges from pragmatic right to ultra-right; the opposition includes a large pragmatic right; and there are almost no defenders of civil liberties. Laws have been proposed that target minorities, outlaw commemoration of the Naqba and abandon Israel&apos;s commitment to the UN convention on refugees. The further erosion of democracy in Israel will only make it harder than ever to reach comprehensive peace and guarantee the country&apos;s future security. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-02-26T11:00:01Z", "title": "Israel's NGOs must operate freely | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["The War and Peace Index of Tel Aviv University last week published results of a poll of Israel&apos;s Jewish residents, which showed that 57% agreed that, in the case of an external conflict, human rights are less important than the national security crisis."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/26/israel-ngo-laws-nif"}, {"tags": ["Dubai", "The Mossad", "Hamas", "Israel", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "British police will travel to Israel to interview six British nationals whose identities were used in the Dubai assassination of a senior Hamas official, as new information emerge that Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was drugged before being killed. The intervention by officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) follows the identification of a further 15 suspects wanted over Mabhouh&apos;s murder, including another six who used British passports. A spokesman for Soca said it would also speak to the second set of passport holders, but stressed none of the 12 would be interviewed as suspects. The move comes as forensic tests showed today that Mabhouh was drugged with a fast-acting muscle relaxant before being suffocated with a pillow, possibly in an attempt to make it look like he had died a natural death. &quot;The assassins used this method so that it would seem that his death was natural as there were no signs of resistance shown by the victim,&quot; deputy police chief Major General Khamis Mattar al-Mazeina told Gulf News. Dubai police said succinylcholine, frequently used by doctors to administer a breathing tube or anaesthetic, was found in the Hamas leader&apos;s bloodstream. Mazeina said the drug can &quot;cause immediate and temporary paralysis&quot;, adding that the forensic report confirmed Mabhouh died of suffocation &quot;using a pillow&quot;. The genuine British passport holders, who are all British-Israeli nationals, will be interviewed by Soca agents in Tel Aviv. They are being treated as witnesses to a crime, a Soca spokesman said, adding that agents would speak to the first six within the next few days. Israeli authorities have been informed, Soca said, and had &quot;no issue&quot; with the move. Dubai police are &quot;99% certain&quot; that Mossad agents were behind the murder but Israeli officials have so far rejected the claims, without specifically denying any role. The Israeli government has kept to a policy of &quot;ambiguity&quot; over Mossad operations, although today the country&apos;s trade minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said the killing shows Hamas that &quot;none of their people are untouchable, they can all be reached&quot;. Ben-Eliezer, a former defence minister, also claimed the Israeli government was aware that the leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement which fights Israel and is banned as a terrorist organisation by the US, had recently taken a trip to Syria disguised in a wig. &quot;He understands that eyes are watching him and that is what is important,&quot; Ben-Eliezer said. Releasing the results of the forensic report into Mabhouh&apos;s death, Dubai police also revealed they had added another name to the list of suspects, while Mazeina said a third Palestinian man had been arrested \u2013 whose &quot;100% involvement in the assassination will make the total to 28&quot;. Mabhouh, a Hamas operative who founded the organisation&apos;s military wing, was killed in a Dubai hotel room on 20 January.

Sutzkever&apos;s work, which focused on his experiences of the Holocaust, was translated into 30 languages. He rescued Yiddish texts during the second world war, and for six decades battled to revive a Yiddish literary tradition when most of its European speakers had perished. Sutzkever felt himself &quot;stung with song by a fiery bee&quot; in his youth. He was born in Smorgon, an industrial town in Tsarist-ruled White Russia. Jews suffered pogroms as the town passed between Russian and German control during the first world war. Sutzkever&apos;s father, a rabbi by training, moved the family to Omsk, in Siberia, and re-established his leather-crafting business, but died at 30. His father&apos;s death coloured the budding poet&apos;s early verse. By 1921, Sutzkever had moved to Vilna (now Vilnius, capital of an independent Lithuania). His exposure to Polish poetry at high school profoundly influenced his earlier work. Vilna had now blossomed into the hub of a vibrant secular Yiddish cultural renaissance. Siberia inspired his 1936 epic poem, Sibir, full of child&apos;s-eye-view imagery, of stars blown by the wind, moonshine and icy rivers, and the fire ceremonies of the Kyrgyz people, whose language he learned. Marc Chagall, a friend, illustrated a 1953 edition of Sibir, his etchings mirroring Sutzkever&apos;s words. In 1936, the visiting Austrian novelist Joseph Roth &quot;discovered&quot; Sutzkever, and the next year the Yiddish Pen Club published his first volume of poetry, Blond Dawn. The titles of his verse, such as In the Knapsack of the Wind and Gypsy Autumn, reflect his transcendental love of nature. In June 1941, the Nazis overran Vilna, killed 5,000 Jews and corralled survivors into two ghettos. They murdered Sutzkever&apos;s mother, and on Yom Kippur liquidated the smaller ghetto, an atrocity Sutzkever witnessed while hiding. He wrote in one poem: &quot;I lie in this coffin/The way I would lie/In a suit made of wood,/A bark/Tossed on treacherous waves, /A cradle, an ark.&quot; Following the Vilna Ghetto collection of 1944, more ghetto poems appeared in Sutzkever&apos;s 1945 volume, Di Festung (The Fortress). Sutzkever&apos;s wife, Freydke, whom he had married the day before war broke out, gave birth during this period, but German guards killed their son. Poignant poems describe dolls without children, shoes without feet, &quot;sounds glimmering like burnt pearls&quot; and &quot;midnight&apos;s black flour&quot;. The Nazis forced Sutzkever to catalogue Jewish treasures for a projected museum of an extinct race. Meanwhile he hid &quot;books and tatters of texts more eternal than marble&quot;. (After the war he helped unearth etchings by Chagall and the diary of Theodor Herzl, the father of political Zionism.) Sutzkever and a fellow poet, Shmerke Kaczerginski, smuggled in guns and conducted play readings. Writing poetry, he later noted, became his weapon against death. On 12 September 1943, just before the ghetto&apos;s final destruction, Sutzkever, Freydke and Kaczerginski escaped through sewers. Only a few hundred of the ghettos&apos; 40,000 survived. Sutzkever&apos;s 1943 narrative poem, Kol Nidre, reached Soviet Jewish writers, including Ilya Ehrenburg and Boris Pasternak, and the exiled future president of Soviet Lithuania, Justas Paleckis. They implored the Kremlin to rescue him. So an aircraft located Sutzkever and Freydke in March 1944, and flew them to Moscow, where their daughter, Rina, was born. In February 1946, Sutzkever gave testimony at the Nuremberg trials. He then left Russia for Paris \u2013 before leading Soviet proponents of Yiddish were purged and executed. In 1947, his family arrived in Tel Aviv. Within two years Sutzkever founded Di Goldene Keyt (The Golden Chain), Israel&apos;s only Yiddish literary quarterly, which he edited until its demise in 1995. Sutzkever resuscitated the careers of Yiddish writers from Europe, the Americas, the Soviet Union and Israel. Official Zionism, however, dismissed Yiddish as a defeatist diaspora argot. &quot;They will not uproot my tongue,&quot; he retorted. &quot;I shall wake all generations with my roar.&quot; Belatedly, in 1985 Sutzkever became the first Yiddish writer to win the prestigious Israel prize for his literature. An English compendium appeared in 1991. Sutzkever was a keen traveller, touring South American jungles and African savannahs, where the sight of elephants and the song of a Basotho chief inspired more Yiddish verse. In the 1970s he became a favourite on the academic lecture circuit, as young Jews rediscovered the language of their grandparents. In 2003, the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research honoured the poet with a retrospective exhibition. Sutzkever once said: &quot;If you carry your childhood with you, you never age.&quot; Surely the best epitaph for a poet who affirmed life, even during unspeakable sufferings. Freydke died in 2003. Rina and another daughter, Mira, survive him, along with two grandchildren. \u2022 Abraham (Avrom) Sutzkever, poet, born 15 July 1913; died 20 January 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-03-02T18:56:06Z", "title": "Abraham Sutzkever", "sentences": ["In 1947, his family arrived in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/02/abraham-sutzkever-obituary"}, {"tags": ["Judaism", "Israel", "World news", "Religion"], "article": "A tiny, interactive Yiddish theatre in the form of a karaoke machine? Could be the first line of a Yiddish joke. Or perhaps it&apos;s a bit of mordant Yiddish commentary on the fate of a language that was in daily use among 11-13 million Jews in Europe on the eve of the Holocaust. A survivor of the Holocaust, the last great Yiddish poet, Abraham Sutzkever, died last month aged 96. As Lawrence Joffe wrote, Sutzkever, who left Russia in 1946 and arrived in Tel Aviv via Paris in 1947, &quot;rescued Yiddish texts during the second world war&quot; and battled against &quot;official Zionism&apos;s ... [dismissal of] Yiddish as a defeatist diaspora argot&quot;. Would a karaoke machine have figured in his quest to revive the Yiddish literary tradition? I&apos;d like to think so \u2013 especially since he lived long enough to witness a Yiddish revival. But also because the karaoke machine is no joke \u2013 though it could be used for telling jokes \u2013 as we learned from Tanya Gold when she test-drove it at the radically expanded Jewish Museum by declaiming Shylock&apos;s most famous line in Yiddish. See Yiddish mentioned in a news story and the punch line is usually something just about to be inscribed on its gravestone. But &quot;Yiddish keeps eluding death&quot; (sadly, the fate of Bo, the language of the Andaman Islands). If my parents&apos; generation had had their way, Yiddish might well have sunk into oblivion. My father and mother both spoke the language, but, like many other families, they used it when we were children as a convenient way of talking about things in our presence that they did not want us to understand. Knowing Yiddish gave them pleasure too, although mixed with guilt and ambivalence. It&apos;s as if they knew it had to disappear, more for the sake of our successful assimilation into British society than theirs, and yet took delight in swapping Yiddish jokes with friends. I often felt that we were somehow expected to understand and even looked upon with a certain degree of pity, nebach, because we didn&apos;t. Yet had we expressed a wish to learn Yiddish, we would have regarded us as meshuggah. We actually knew enough already to enjoy the broken-Yiddish American humour of comedian and musician Mickey Katz. I can still remember the cover of his album The Most Mishige, with the diminutive Katz manically strumming a guitar beside a statuesque, busty brunette in a white leotard. The Holocaust, the resurgence of Hebrew, assimilation, shrinking Jewish populations, all have contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of Yiddish speakers, but the language, and what it represents, may well be outwitting history. Although no one knows exactly how many Yiddish speakers there are today, estimates range from a very realistic minimum of 1 million to a more fanciful 3 million. At the core of this population are the Hasidic and strictly orthodox Jews in New York, Israel, London, Paris, Antwerp and elsewhere for whom Yiddish is their first language. In the UK alone, where the strictly orthodox are growing in number, there are probably as many as 30,000 Yiddish speakers. The vast majority of these Jews live in relatively closed communities, but there is always some &quot;leakage&quot; into the wider Jewish world. Beyond the very religious, Yiddish has been undergoing a marked revival, especially among young people, for more than 20 years. There are reportedly more than 100 colleges and universities around the world teaching Yiddish, although courses and posts are vulnerable in straightened times. The Zionist drive to stigmatise Yiddish has collapsed and the revival has spread to Israel. The main driver of this revival is the fact that, as Jewish populations become more diverse and Jewish identity less connected to religion and more to ethnicity, Jews are increasingly looking for alternative ways to be Jewish. And more accessible than ever is the richly stocked storehouse of Jewish culture and history, especially, but not exclusively, from eastern Europe. It&apos;s common now to flesh out an alternative Jewish identity with a passion for klezmer (the traditional music of the Jewish shtetl), an interest in Yiddish theatre, novels, poetry and films exploring aspects of the European Jewish past, and participation in cultural festivals of which Yiddish song and performance are major components. To keep things in perspective, the speaking and writing of Yiddish is not going to become the day-to-day routine of secular Jewish life. Although, if strictly orthodox numbers continue to grow, the status of Yiddish as a living language will become increasingly secure. With the bitter religious and political divisions among Jews so intense, the revival of Yiddish culture, and Jewish culture more generally, is often seen as a neutral and non-political good news story. This is naive. It is linked to lifestyles that orthodox Jews abhor. It proves that Zionism failed to consign other forms of Jewish life to oblivion. It challenges hegemonic and defensive Jewish leadership. And it&apos;s not immune from political manipulation or of being co-opted in Jewish political battles. Who knows, perhaps, that innocent Yiddish karaoke machine is powered by chutzpah, and has wickedly subversive potential. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-03-05T11:00:00Z", "title": "Yiddish is no joke | Antony Lerman", "sentences": ["As Lawrence Joffe wrote, Sutzkever, who left Russia in 1946 and arrived in Tel Aviv via Paris in 1947, &quot;rescued Yiddish texts during the second world war&quot; and battled against &quot;official Zionism&apos;s ...

He said he wasn&apos;t at any of the meetings [including one at Chequers before Blair went to Crawford to see George Bush], but he should have been at the meetings. He has a lot of responsibility [for the invasion]. He keeps going on about the budget. He says the money was there \u2013 why wasn&apos;t it used on the armed forces?

I believe he was against it in the beginning, but he&apos;s prime minister now and he&apos;s not prepared to backtrack. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democract leader This was a day that he must have feared for a very long time, because for years Gordon Brown has sought to make us believe that this war wasn&apos;t really to do with him. It was Tony Blair&apos;s war. It wasn&apos;t Gordon Brown&apos;s war. So this was the day that he finally had to come clean. And he has said today ... that he believes the Iraq war was right. That tells you all you need to know about the moral compass of Gordon Brown. We now know we were betrayed by Gordon Brown, we were betrayed by the Labour party. George Galloway, Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and outspoken critic of the war It was as anticlimactic as Gordon Brown&apos;s long coveted ascension to No 10 has become. Here was a chance, after all, for him to put some distance between Labour and the disastrous decision to follow George W Bush into a war of regime change, signed in other people&apos;s blood at Crawford, Texas, in 2002. Instead, Brown trotted out the weary apologias which so few in our country any longer believe: that the decision was based on definitive intelligence, which the spooks dispute, and had the backing of international law, which the lawyers refute. That much was predictable; it was unfeasible that he would either denounce his predecessor or claim he was merely a desiccated calculating machine, whirring away in a darkened Treasury in complete ignorance of the greatest blunder of our age being hatched just opposite. But, as with Tony Blair, the most alarming aspect of his answers was not about what had gone before \u2013 the public mind is settled on that, in any case, no matter what scholastic distinctions the Chilcot report finally makes \u2013 it was the threat of more to come. Blair mentioned Iran 58 times. Brown&apos;s refrain was &quot;rogue states&quot;. Those of us who marched against war on Iraq in 2002 were told we were being precipitate. It should now be clear to all that the die was already cast. Taken with the rising drumbeat from Tel Aviv and Washington, Brown&apos;s testimony should be taken as a serious portent of yet more mayhem. Professor Paul Kelly, head of government department at the London School of Economics He&apos;s obviously prepared \u2013 anyone can see [that] from the opening statement and tribute to the troops who died. He obviously decided not to fall into the Blair trap. It&apos;s familiar Brown territory, to answer different questions [to those he was asked]. Roderic Lyne pushed him quite hard on when things were decided, on what was the timeline. Brown keeps talking about wanting to get the global monetary organisations and UN on board in May [2003, after the invasion], but Lyne was trying to push him on the lack of initial consultation, pre-March. He&apos;s sidestepped that issue, which was the core point. Lyne&apos;s tried bravely, but the committee really needed some great forensic person or advocate to push this line of questioning. They tried hard but they don&apos;t want to be seen as too political. Another issue he could have been pushed hard on is: why was Robin Cook a sceptic? There was scepticism about the decision-making stage and he&apos;s managed to distance himself from questions about the strategy. He&apos;s come out again saying he was on [the] side [of going to war]. He&apos;s been careful not to blame Blair for everything and say: &quot;I was doing the economy,&quot; which was a trap he could have fallen into, but he&apos;s sought to put distance between himself and Blair at the same time.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-05T16:59:00Z", "title": "Gordon Brown at Iraq inquiry \u2013 reaction", "sentences": ["Taken with the rising drumbeat from Tel Aviv and Washington, Brown&apos;s testimony should be taken as a serious portent of yet more mayhem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/05/gordon-brown-chilcot-iraq-inquiry-reaction"}, {"tags": ["Rubin Kazan", "CSKA Moscow", "Spartak Moscow", "Zenit St Petersburg", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Fourteen, 15 and, for now, 16: the Russian top flight looks as though it will kick off this weekend with the full complement of teams, but it&apos;s as well to keep checking as the financial winter bites. The battle at the top is likely to be between the usual suspects of Rubin Kazan, CSKA Moscow, Spartak Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg, but the real battle may be simply one of survival. The Russian football boom was largely financed by the boom in Russian natural resources, and that is in retreat. GDP fell in 2009 after years of stellar growth, and the impact is already being felt in football, with FK Moskva folding last month after NorNikel withdrew their sponsorship. That completed the shameful collapse of Torpedo Moscow of which FK Moskva was once a splinter. Even as the conspiracy theorists suggested it was all part of a plot to get Alania Vladikavkaz back into the top flight (and so appease one of Russia&apos;s more troubled regions, runs the logic, even though the Caucasus already had three representatives in the top flight), it also served as a warning to others. The general perception may be that English football is unsustainable, but compared to Russia it seems comfortingly robust. The Russian top flight as a whole generates only $24m (\u00a316m) a year in television rights, while with attendances averaging only around 12,000, income from gate receipts \u2013 and thus merchandising and advertising \u2013 is tiny. Almost every club is dependent on a patron, usually a commodities company backed by an oligarch (FK Moskva&apos;s future was first cast in doubt in February 2007 when Mikhail Prokhorov, a keen football fan and now Russia&apos;s richest man, left NorNikel, intent on separating his assets from those of his long-time partner Vladimir Potanin), the local government or some combination of the two. The regional government of Tatarstan continues to back Rubin, Zenit are sponsored by Gazprom, Spartak by Lukoil, and CSKA have just struck a deal with the mid-sized oil company Bashneft for an undisclosed fee, but Shafir Galeyev of Deloitte said he believes that every Russian club posted an operational loss last season, although there is no possibility of performing a full audit. After FK Moskva, there was a serious possibility that Krylya Sovetov might have gone out of business before the season began. They reportedly owe $80m to various creditors, including Roman Abramovich, who loaned the club $5.4m several years ago, although it is not thought that he is making urgent demands to recover the money. As late as a fortnight ago, players had not been paid their bonuses since August, part of $15m believed to be owed to the squad, while the coach Yuri Gazzaev \u2013 the cousin of the Dynamo Kyiv coach Valeri \u2013 had not been paid at all. The squad are now threatening to boycott their opening game this weekend unless the bonuses are paid. With creditors pressing, the Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Igor Sechin, his deputy with responsibility for the oil and gas industries, and Sergei Chemezov, head of Russian Technologies, who sponsor Krylya, to find a way of ensuring the club survived. Putin similarly used what is euphemistically known as his &quot;administrative resource&quot; to save Tom Tomsk last season. Sechin has said that Krylya require a yearly budget of up to $30m. It is not yet clear which companies will be asked to contribute, but last year Tom were saved by a combination of Rosneft, the largest oil company in Russia, Gazprom Neft, which used to be Sibneft, and others. Last year&apos;s champions Rubin Kazan, who begin against Yuri Semin&apos;s Lokomotiv on Sunday, have lost arguably their best player of last season, the Argentinian forward Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, who returned to Zenit after the completion of his loan spell and was sold to Valencia. They have a coherent method, though, and will hope that Fatih Tekke, brought in from Zenit, can replicate his sparkle. The Turkish forward is one of six winter signings, including the Spanish defender Jordi Figueras, from Celta Vigo, and the Israel international midfielder Bebars Natcho, who played in both legs of the Europa League last-32 game for Hapoel Tel Aviv against Rubin last month. Rubin, who were more expansive last season than they had been in securing their first title success a year before, were back to their cagey best on Sunday, beating CSKA 1-0 with a fine defensive display an Alexander Bukharov goal to lift the Super Cup. Repeated changes of management undermined CSKA last season, and it was only when Leonid Slutsky replaced Juande Ramos, who had himself replaced Zico, that they achieved any measure of stability. That was enough to carry them into the last 16 of the Champions League, and their chances in the league are to an extent conditioned by how much of a distraction that proves. The arrival of the Japanese forward Keisuke Honda is intriguing, but it is hard to believe they will not miss the explosive striking talents of Vagner Love. The attacking midfielder Alan Dzagoev remains one of the most exciting prospects in world football, but there are major problems at the back where, at 30, Sergei Ignashevich is showing signs of age and the constant strain of playing alongside the increasingly hapless Vasili Berezutsky. They get the season under way on Friday at home to Amkar Perm. Spartak, after a difficult start to last season, improved dramatically as Valeri Karpin trusted in youth, although it remains to be seen whether they are sufficiently battle-hardened to mount a real challenge. Alex is a creator of genuine quality, while Welliton was the league&apos;s top scorer last season. and they will be complemented in the forward line by a third Brazilian, Ari, signed from AZ Alkmaar. The Montenegrin centre-back Nikola Drincic, hailed as the new Nemanja Vidic, has also arrived from Amkar, but a broken leg sustained in pre-season is likely to keep him out until August. Zenit, meanwhile, must be hoping that their long and uneasy transition after winning the Uefa Cup in 2008 is over. They have continued their policy of foreign coaches with the appointment of Luciano Spalletti, who pioneered strikerlessness at Roma, and have made four winter signings, all of them of sufficiently proven quality to suggest the transfer gambling that so enraged Dick Advocaat is over. Four years after he left for Sevilla, the forward Alexander Kerzhakov has returned from Dinamo, with the international midfielder Igor Semshov moving in the opposite direction, and he is joined by the Serbian forward Danko Lazovic from PSV, the Belarusian goalkeeper Yuri Zhevnov from FK Moskva and the 22-year-old Denmark full-back Michael Lumb from AGF. Whatever happens in the title race, though, the greatest success for Russian football might be reaching November with 16 top-flight clubs.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-09T14:53:19Z", "title": "After the boom, Russia's leading clubs are fighting to avoid the bust | Jonathan Wilson", "sentences": ["The Turkish forward is one of six winter signings, including the Spanish defender Jordi Figueras, from Celta Vigo, and the Israel international midfielder Bebars Natcho, who played in both legs of the Europa League last-32 game for Hapoel Tel Aviv against Rubin last month."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/mar/09/rubin-kazan-russia-football-finances"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news", "Middle East peace talks"], "article": "The US vice-president, Joe Biden, today attempted to salvage the Middle East peace talks after the Palestinians announced they were pulling out of a new round of indirect negotiations before they had begun.

The US vice-president said an agreement would be &quot;profoundly&quot; in Israel&apos;s interests and appealed to the Israeli government to make a serious attempt to reach peace with the Palestinians. &quot;The most important thing is for these talks to go forward, and go forward promptly, and go forward in good faith,&quot; he said in a speech at Tel Aviv University. &quot;We can&apos;t delay, because when progress is postponed, extremists exploit our differences.&quot; After strongly condemning the Israeli settlement expansion earlier in the week, Biden used today&apos;s speech to praise the country, saying the US had &quot;no better friend&quot;. But he stressed the need to end the conflict to restore to the Palestinians &quot;the fundamental dignity and self-respect that their current predicament denies them&quot;. Yesterday, Moussa said he had been told by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that even the low-key process of &quot;proximity talks&quot; could not begin unless Israel stopped expanding its settlements. &quot;The Palestinian side is not ready to negotiate under the present circumstances,&quot; Moussa said. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have not held direct negotiations since Israel&apos;s war in Gaza last year. On Monday, the White House won agreement from the two sides to begin the indirect talks, hoping they would lead to face-to-face meetings. The Palestinians had insisted there would be no direct talks unless Israel halted all settlement expansion, in line with the demands of the US administration and the &quot;road map&quot;, which remains the framework of peace talks. But the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, leading a rightwing coalition government, offered only a temporary and partial curb to new building. Then on Tuesday \u2013 hours after Biden met Israeli leaders \u2013 the Israeli interior ministry announced approval for 1,600 new apartments in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. All settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law. Israel&apos;s opposition Kadima party said it planned a no-confidence vote in the prime minister in parliament for &quot;destroying&quot; the Biden visit. Yesterday, Biden emerged from talks with Abbas in Ramallah, on the occupied West Bank, and repeated his criticisms of the timing and substance of Israel&apos;s announcement. &quot;It is incumbent on both parties to build an atmosphere of support for negotiations and not to complicate them,&quot; he said. &quot;The decision by the Israeli government to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem undermines that very trust, the trust that we need right now in order to begin ... profitable negotiations.&quot; The Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, said the Palestinians appreciated &quot;the strong statement of condemnation&quot; by the US administration. Eli Yishai, the Israeli interior minister, apologised for the timing of the announcement, admitting it had caused Biden &quot;real embarrassment&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-11T13:45:34Z", "title": "Joe Biden attempts to salvage Middle East peace talks", "sentences": ["&quot;The most important thing is for these talks to go forward, and go forward promptly, and go forward in good faith,&quot; he said in a speech at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/11/joe-biden-middle-east-talks"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "Joe Biden", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Middle East peace talks"], "article": "Israeli authorities are considering plans for at least another 8,000 homes in settlements in East Jerusalem, it emerged today, despite the latest collapse in proposed peace talks with the Palestinians. US vice-president Joe Biden, who earlier condemned Israel for approving plans to build hundreds of new settler homes, took a more conciliatory tone in a speech today, urging Israel and the Palestinians to restart direct peace negotiations. &quot;The only path though to finally resolving the permanent status issues, including borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem, are direct talks,&quot; he said. He also moderated his earlier criticism of Israel, saying the US had &quot;no better friend&quot;. Hagit Ofran, a settlement expert at Israeli group Peace Now, compiled a list of planned East Jerusalem settlements that are at one of the several stages of approval. She counted 8,253 proposed homes, including the 1,600 new homes announced on Tuesday for the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Ramat Shlomo. After the latest approval this week, Palestinian leaders promptly pulled out of a new round of indirect &quot;proximity&quot; talks with Israel that the US administration had spent months setting up. The 10 numbered plans Ofran has identified, some of which are years from construction, are in East Jerusalem settlements including Givat Hamatos, Pisgat Ze&apos;ev, Neve Ya&apos;acov, Gilo and Ramot. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth published a similar list of 19 plans, identifying 7,038 housing units awaiting approval. Another newspaper, Ha&apos;aretz, said as many as 50,000 homes - nearly all in Jewish settlements - were in various stages of planning and approval for east Jerusalem, citing planning officials. The paper said the city&apos;s construction plans for the coming years focused on east Jerusalem because a plan to expand west had been cancelled three years ago. Israel regards East Jerusalem, which it captured in the 1967 war, as sovereign territory and the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has spoken frequently in defence of Jewish settlement there. But the international community does not recognise Israeli sovereignty and settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law. Palestinian officials say they will not return to direct peace talks unless all settlement-building is stopped, a demand also made last year by the US administration. Netanyahu has ordered only a temporary, partial curb on construction. Yesterday, Netanyahu gave his interior minister, Eli Yishai, a dressing down about the timing of the Ramat Shlomo plans, which came as an embarrassment to Biden during his visit. But there was no suggestion the plans would be cancelled. &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and construction there will be carried out like in Tel Aviv or any other city \u2013 in every part of Jerusalem according to the plans,&quot; Israeli cabinet secretary Zvi Hauser told Israel Radio. &quot;Jerusalem is a big city. It is a city that has to grow&quot; Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, told the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, that the Palestinians would not take part in the newly agreed indirect talks. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the Palestinians would not take part unless the US forced Israel to cancel the Ramat Shlomo construction \u2013 although that seems an unlikely step. Palestinian officials said they saw no reason to negotiate while settlements continued to grow and no direct talks have been held since Israel&apos;s war on Gaza more than a year ago. Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent independent Palestinian politician, said: &quot;Israeli deliberate measures at expanding settlement activities, at carrying out further building of illegal settlements in and around Jerusalem \u2013 all these are designed to scuttle all American efforts at trying to relaunch any kind of talks be they direct or indirect, proximity or long-distance.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-03-11T19:22:29Z", "title": "Israel plans more East Jerusalem homes as talks collapse", "sentences": ["&quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and construction there will be carried out like in Tel Aviv or any other city \u2013 in every part of Jerusalem according to the plans,&quot; Israeli cabinet secretary Zvi Hauser told Israel Radio."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/11/israel-homes-east-jerusalem-talks"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Joe Biden", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics", "Middle East and North Africa", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Mahmoud Abbas"], "article": "Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has a bad habit: when things appear to be moving in the right direction for him, he stumbles upon some stupid political landmine, raising doubts about his leadership and credibility. A series of blunders had ruined his first term in the 1990s, and on his way back to power Netanyahu promised that he had changed.  For a year, he stayed away from trouble, avoiding unscripted public remarks, giving no interviews, and being attentive to other politicians&apos; needs and interests. But this week, he did it again, ruining the visit of American vice president Joe Biden with an official announcement of a plan to build 1,600 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a Jewish neighbourhood of East Jerusalem \u2013 despite a well-known American opposition to Israeli settlement expansion.  Netanyahu apparently didn&apos;t know in advance about the interior ministry&apos;s decision, taken by mid-level planning and zoning bureaucrats. But it was according to his government&apos;s policy, and he should have and could have taken steps to avoid such unpleasant surprises. His failure to do so portrays him as a hopeless schlemiel, just like &quot;old Bibi&quot; from the previous term. Biden&apos;s trip was meant to mark a new chapter in the cool relationship between the Obama administration and Israel. Mindful of its political trouble at home in view of the midterm elections, and worried about an Israeli attack on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, the White House dispatched the veep \u2013 known to be Netanyahu&apos;s best friend in Washington \u2013 to plead Barack Obama&apos;s case to the Israeli leadership and public. Biden&apos;s trip coincided with the announcement of indirect Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, to give the battered administration a diplomatic success. The Israeli interior ministry announcement, on Tuesday afternoon, put Biden in the worst possible position: rather than visit the Middle East as an honest peacebroker, he appeared as Israel&apos;s patsy. And not only Biden: Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, agreed to resume talks with Netanyahu despite Israel&apos;s refusal to hold off construction in East Jerusalem. The new project threatened to show Abbas as Israel&apos;s collaborator. Previous prime ministers built more than Netanyahu in East Jerusalem, but they were careful to tie it in with positive developments in the peace process to avoid American anger. Lacking peace negotiations, Netanyahu&apos;s rightwing coalition could not enjoy the American blind eye like its predecessors. Time and again in the past year there were diplomatic clashes over Israeli plans to settle Jews in Arab neighbourhoods, to build new homes for Jews, or to demolish Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem. Each time Netanyahu argued that he was not in the loop, but backed the decisions. His coalition partner Eli Yishai, the interior minister and leader of the rightwing Shas party, has made the settling of more Jews in East Jerusalem his cause celebre \u2013 to prevent a future partition of the city, and to deliver cheap housing to his ultra-Orthodox constituents. In November the Americans tacitly agreed to the exemption of East Jerusalem \u2013 the most contested spot in the Holy Land conflict \u2013 from the settlement freeze announced by Netanyahu. But they expected not to be publicly embarrassed. When Israel couldn&apos;t keep the deal, snubbing its senior American guest, the administration exploded. Biden called Obama, who told him to condemn the Israeli decision in the strongest terms \u2013 an unprecedented step in a high-level visit. Netanyahu apologised for the timing, and told Biden that the project in question will be built only &quot;within several years&quot;. The vice president accepted the apology, and delivered a staunchly pro-Israel speech at Tel Aviv University, praising &quot;my close personal friend&quot; Netanyahu. The Palestinians were less satisfied, withdrawing their agreement to renew talks. Netanyahu&apos;s constant zigzagging between his rightwing ideology and political partners and his craving for American support has turned the vice president&apos;s visit into a diplomatic fiasco. Ultimately Netanyahu could not please both sides without paying a price. Biden&apos;s face-saving remarks aside, &quot;Bibi&quot; is left with no friends in America&apos;s highest echelons \u2013 when he needs all the support he can get vis a vis Iran&apos;s threats and the Palestinians&apos; quest for independence. America will not abandon Israel, but its patience for its leader is running out. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-03-12T08:00:00Z", "title": "How Bibi lost a best friend | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["The vice president accepted the apology, and delivered a staunchly pro-Israel speech at Tel Aviv University, praising &quot;my close personal friend&quot; Netanyahu."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/12/bibi-lost-best-friend-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "US foreign policy", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "World news", "Hezbollah"], "article": "One would think that the British government \u2013 considering its history in the Middle East of colonising and partitioning the land and overthrowing governments and its support of undemocratic and dictatorial regimes \u2013 would be wary of sending its representatives to offer advice to Arab nations on how best to achieve their right to self-determination. But apparently the British ambassador to Lebanon didn&apos;t get the memo. Last month Frances Guy told the Lebanese daily an-Nahar that &quot;the [Lebanese] state cannot enjoy sovereignty if there was one group from within the state that has more weapons than the army&quot;. Of course, the group she was referring to was Hezbollah \u2013 the Shia Islamic political and resistance movement in Lebanon. While the UK ambassador&apos;s formula might work in some countries, it cannot be applied to Lebanon. The Lebanese army has never been considered capable of defending the country against an Israeli attack. Not only has it always had to struggle with a weak and divided leadership, but its aid packages and arms shipments from the US look like pennies and toy guns when compared to those received by Israel. Hence the popular support in Lebanon for a non-state resistance movement capable of facing off with Israel and protecting Lebanon&apos;s sovereignty. When referring to Hezbollah in the context of Israel, many Lebanese \u2013 including the government \u2013 refer to it as &quot;the resistance&quot; (al-muqawama in Arabic), and not by name. Hezbollah is not the first organisation formed in Lebanon to resist Israeli attacks on the country. It was born under Israeli occupation and filled the resistance void after its predecessors, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its Lebanese allies, were defeated in 1982 when Israel was able to invade Beirut after several years of civil war ravaged the country. For whatever reason, Hezbollah has been the most effective resistance movement in Lebanon&apos;s history of conflict with Israel to date. In 2000, when Israel withdrew its troops from nearly all of the Lebanese territory it had occupied for 22 years, the resistance was celebrated as the victor. In 2006, when Israel waged an all-out war on Lebanon, ostensibly in response to a Hezbollah cross-border raid during which two Israeli soldiers were captured, and retreated 34 days later, the resistance was again celebrated as the victor. At the height of the 2006 war, a poll conducted by the Beirut Centre for Research &amp; Information found 87% of Lebanese supported &quot;the confrontations carried out by the resistance against the Israeli aggression against Lebanon&quot;. Support for the resistance, especially during times of war and occupation, is one of the few issues that most can agree on in a politically divided country like Lebanon. Days after the British ambassador&apos;s comments, on the eve of the Mawlid holiday when Muslims celebrate the prophet Mohammed&apos;s birthday, many in Beirut lay awake in bed, unable to sleep as Israeli warplanes flew back and forth across the skies above the Lebanese capital. These overflights \u2013 a clear violation of Lebanon&apos;s sovereignty and of UN security council resolution 1701 \u2013 are not rare occurrences. In recent years Israeli aircraft can often be heard above southern Lebanon. Not to mention the landmines and cluster bombs that Israel generously left scattered all over the south after each of its withdrawals and which continue to threaten farmers and children playing in the fields. Yet oddly enough the UK, along with the US and other governments that have &quot;special relationships&quot; with Israel, have remained silent about these clear violations of Lebanese sovereignty. The British ambassador&apos;s comments of course reflect a larger feeling of desperation among some western countries that consider Hezbollah a &quot;terrorist&quot; organisation and have supported any and all attacks against it, whether by Israel or other Lebanese groups. One week before Guy&apos;s comments, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said to Israel in a televised speech: &quot;If you strike Rafiq al-Hariri International Airport in Beirut, we will strike Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.&quot; In 2006, after Israel bombed Beirut airport in the first hours of the war, Hezbollah did not have the ability to strike back at more significant Israeli targets. But now, all sides agree that Hezbollah is better trained and better equipped, making it an even more formidable military force than it was four years ago. Therefore, the question that many have been asking \u2013 whether or not Israel will attack Lebanon again \u2013 is no longer relevant. How can Israel attack Lebanon again? is now the question. After being handed defeats by a weaker Hezbollah in 2000 and 2006, Israel seems to have few options left. Another poll conducted recently shows that 84% of Lebanese &quot;trust the resistance&apos;s capabilities facing any Israeli attack&quot;. This overwhelming confidence in Hezbollah \u2013 the resistance \u2013 indicates that the Lebanese have a good idea of how to be able to enjoy their sovereignty. But the UK, the US and Israel must also accept that the resistance is real, and abandon the language of bombs if they wish to communicate with the people of Lebanon.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-15T14:30:00Z", "title": "Britain still doesn't get Lebanon | Matthew Cassel", "sentences": ["One week before Guy&apos;s comments, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said to Israel in a televised speech: &quot;If you strike Rafiq al-Hariri International Airport in Beirut, we will strike Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.&quot; In 2006, after Israel bombed Beirut airport in the first hours of the war, Hezbollah did not have the ability to strike back at more significant Israeli targets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/15/britain-middle-east-policy-lebanon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US news", "Foreign policy", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Barack Obama"], "article": "Talk about Israel to all but its most severe critics in America and whatever they say it&apos;s likely to be underpinned by an assumption that the US is the Jewish state&apos;s best friend. Doubts may emerge about Gaza and settlements but any criticism is invariably wrapped in the assumption that the US has Israel&apos;s interests, particularly its security, at heart. It&apos;s not surprising given that American politicians pledge their loyalty to the Jewish state over and over, and mean it. They see things differently in Jerusalem. In a country permeated by fear and insecurity, Israelis define the rest of the world not by loyalties but by varying degrees of distrust. You can hear it among residents of Jewish settlements deep in the occupied territories and in the cafes of liberal Tel Aviv: angst over the perception of a new wave of antisemitism gripping Europe, the incomprehension over foreign condemnation of Israel&apos;s crimes in Gaza, the common agreement that the United Nations is a conspiracy against the Jewish state. In all of this, the US emerges as the least distrusted country by far (Britain commands a much lower level of confidence). Israelis recognise that they have long counted on Washington to pay a good chunk of their military budget and provide diplomatic cover for the illegalities of occupation.But that is a far cry from trust, and what there was has been severely eroded since Barack Obama came to power as America catches up with the idea that Israeli government policies do not automatically equate with what is in Israel&apos;s interests or the promotion of peace. That distinction has finally burst forth with the crisis over settlement building in East Jerusalem, exposing how far American political thinking has already shifted and the depth of Israel&apos;s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s failure to understand it. To the alarm of some Israeli leaders, what they regarded as a minor diplomatic blunder in announcing yet more ethnically exclusive housing in East Jerusalem has resulted not only in unusually forceful criticism from Washington, but the disturbing and unprecedented assertion by the White House that Israeli policies are jeopardising American interests and even endangering the lives of US soldier fighting in the Middle East. In days, the Israeli government has seen itself repositioned from valuable US ally in the war on terror to where it really belongs \u2013 as the primary obstacle to peace. It was always striking to watch the smugness with which Israeli politicians sold Americans the idea that the only issue in considering the conflict with the Palestinians was what Ariel Sharon called, with deeply rolling Rs, the &quot;tehrroar&quot;. The ever-expanding Jewish settlements, the annexing of land, expulsion of Palestinians, the killings of Arab children, the crimes of occupation, were discarded as an irrelevance. No one in George Bush&apos;s White House cared to challenge Sharon on that. In Israel, ordinary people almost seemed programmed to repeat the wearying mantra that all the Jewish state ever wanted was peace but that all it ever got in return was blood and killing. That was a comfortable position for Israelis who, all too understandably at the height of the suicide bombings, found it difficult to reflect on why Palestinians might be blowing themselves up. But the myth of the relentless search for peace was important to the efforts of Sharon and Netanyahu to ensure that Americans did not call them on policies that deliberately or not \u2013 mostly deliberately \u2013 sabotaged its ever-diminishing prospects. Nowhere was this more clear than over the ever growing settlements. Israel&apos;s apologists would have the world believe that the construction of homes solely for Jews in the occupied territories had no impact on the peace process and that the issue would be resolved in final status talks. But settlement construction is a litmus test of Israeli government intent because it is constantly changing the picture on the ground. The number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank has more doubled since the Oslo peace accords were signed in 1993. How is it possible to see that as anything but an attempt to preempt an agreement on Palestine&apos;s borders? Watching Israel&apos;s barrier carve its way through Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem and the West Bank, its real intent was all too evident. The clues lay in the twists and turns that separated Palestinian villages from land then delivered up to Jewish settlers. As the barrier went up, there was barely a peep of protest from Washington. But the ground has also shifted in America. The unconditional support for the Jewish state has been eroding in critical areas. Nowhere is that clearer than among American Jews, many of whom stayed quiet for so long out of loyalty to the country of Israel and Zionism, even as they grew increasingly disturbed at what was being done in their name by the militarists in Jerusalem. In Washington, a group of Jews broke the taboo against criticising Israeli policy and launched J Street, an organisation that believes Israel&apos;s security lies in a just peace with the Palestinians. Founded by Jeremy Ben-Ami, a former domestic policy adviser to Bill Clinton with Israeli parents, it drew the backing of an array of community leaders, activists and academics. It reflects the doubts held by a significant proportion of American Jews about Jerusalem&apos;s militarist policies and, in particular, the deep-rooted obsession with settlements. Those doubts were heard and shared in the White House. The government in Jerusalem has been slow to grasp the significance of J Street because for so long many American Jews declined to voice their doubts out of loyalty. Buoyed by the certainty that it was irrelevant, Netanyahu dismissed the group as anti-Israeli and his foreign ministry snubbed a delegation of visiting members of the US congress sponsored by the Jewish organisation. It was a mistake because it only confirmed in the minds of some in Congress and the administration that Israel will only move when pushed. Recent events have confirmed that view as Netanyahu finally begins to understand the consequences of his mistake and climbs down, agreeing to a series of American demands aimed at kick-starting negotiations and putting the latest settlement plans on hold. It&apos;s a start, but Netanyahu is not a courageous leader nor an honest one. He pays lip service to a peace agreement but, like Sharon, spent the 1990s sabotaging attempts to reach agreements with the Palestinians and denouncing Israeli leaders who sought peace as traitors or worse. Netanyahu has still to commit himself to a genuinely independent Palestinian state. He will not do the right thing for the right reason. Some in the US administration are straining at the leash to finally take him on and show him the way after continual humiliation of the US president.

Netanyahu sounded a defiant tone today, refusing to back down on settlement construction in East Jerusalem, but he faced a new round of criticism after four Palestinian teenagers were shot dead on the occupied West Bank in the space of 24 hours, in what Palestinian officials condemned as an Israeli military escalation. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, travelled to Gaza, where he denounced the Israeli economic blockade and the &quot;unacceptable suffering&quot; it causes. Netanyahu was to fly to Washington tonight to speak at the annual meeting of the powerful pro-Israel lobby Aipac before his meeting with the president. His trip comes at a time of rare crisis in relations between Israel and the US, triggered by Israeli approval earlier this month for the construction of hundreds of settler homes in Jerusalem. The international community does not recognise Israel&apos;s occupation and annexation of East Jerusalem, and settlements on occupied land are regarded as illegal under international law. The approval for the construction meant indirect talks with the Palestinians collapsed before they had even begun. At first Washington was strongly critical of Israel, but the administration soon tempered its language and has instead reportedly pressed for concessions from the Israelis in private. However, Netanyahu refuses to concede on the main issue: he told his cabinet today he would not give up building in East Jerusalem. &quot;From our point of view, construction in Jerusalem is like construction in Tel Aviv,&quot; he said. &quot;These are the things which we have made very clear to the American administration.&quot; He did concede that all key issues could be discussed in any indirect &quot;proximity&quot; talks involving Israel and the Palestinians, but there have been no talks between the two sides since Israel&apos;s war in Gaza, more than a year ago. George Mitchell, the US special envoy, was in Jerusalem again today hoping to start at least indirect talks. Speaking before meeting Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, Mitchell said US relations with Israel were &quot;unshakeable&quot;. The diplomacy was overshadowed by growing concerns about violence on the ground. Two Palestinian teenagers, Muhammad and Salah Qawariq, were shot dead today by Israeli troops near Nablus. The military said the two had tried to stab a soldier; Palestinian officials said the pair had been farming and were detained by the troops for some minutes before they were shot. The incident happened as Palestinians in another village near Nablus buried two boys, Mohammad Qadus, 15, and Osaid Qadus, 17, who were shot dead by Israeli troops on Saturday. It marked the most serious violence in the occupied West Bank for more than a year. A Thai worker was also killed in southern Israel last week by a rocket fired by Gazan militants. Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, said there had been a &quot;military escalation&quot; by Israeli which &quot;has serious risks and puts in jeopardy the Palestinian authority&apos;s achievements of security and stability&quot;. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, said the latest killings were a &quot;provocation&quot;, and that Palestinians should not return to negotiations without a halt to all settlement building. &quot;Without a total and complete freeze of settlements immediately, both in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, any negotiations will be a cover for Israeli measures,&quot; he said. The UN secretary general, Ban, crossed into Gaza and again called for an end to the three-year economic blockade of the strip and its 1.5 million Palestinian residents. Israel has finally allowed in window frames and construction materials to allow the UN to complete 151 apartments, but there are still tens of thousands of homes awaiting repair after last year&apos;s war. The supplies were &quot;a drop in a bucket of water&quot;, Ban said. The blockade &quot;undercuts moderates and encourages extremists&quot;, he said. Demonstration deathsX-ray reveals teenager shot with live ammunition It was mid-afternoon on Saturday when Mohammad Qadus, 15, and Osaid Qadus, 17, returned by bus to their village, Iraq Burin, near Nablus. They arrived during a demonstration that took their lives. Israelis from the nearby Brakha settlement, built in part on the village&apos;s land, had come down on to Iraq Burin&apos;s farmland, as they do most Saturdays, according to Palestinian witnesses. The villagers began protesting and Israeli troops were deployed, entering the village. Palestinian boys threw stones at the soldiers; the soldiers fired teargas and rubber-coated bullets. The two Qadus boys, friends but not close relatives, were at the end of the village furthest from the settlement and did not join in the stone throwing, witnesses said. But an Israeli army vehicle approached, and a soldier fired two rounds in quick succession at the boys. Mohammad was hit in the chest and died within minutes. Osaid was hit in the head, slipped into a coma and died hours later in hospital. Amir Aref, 16, a friend of both boys, tried to drag them to safety. He described how he saw Osaid sitting on the ground in front of a store. &quot;I was telling him: &apos;Stand up, stand up.&apos; But he refused to answer,&quot; Aref said. &quot;I looked at him. Blood was coming down from a small hole in his forehead, his brains were coming out.&quot; He then turned to Mohammad and saw him lying on the road nearby. He had been hit in the chest: photos of his corpse later showed a small entry wound near his heart and a larger exit wound in his back. &quot;I carried him and took him into the village in my arms,&quot; Aref said. &quot;I looked at him and he said &apos;Amir&apos;, then blood came out of his mouth. He gasped and then he died.&quot; Witnesses and doctors at the Nablus Speciality hospital, where the boys were taken, said both had been hit by what appeared to be live rounds. The Israeli military said in a statement there had been a &quot;violent and illegal riot&quot; in the village and that soldiers &quot;responded with riot dispersal means&quot;. It said troops fired teargas and rubber bullets but denied firing live rounds. &quot;Live fire was not used,&quot; it said. However, a hospital x-ray of Osaid Qadus, seen by the Guardian, showed a bullet lodged in his brain. Ahmed Hamad, a doctor at the Nablus hospital, said the x-ray showed a &quot;classic, pure metallic bullet&quot;. He said both boys had injuries with small entry wounds indicating live rounds. As the families buried their children today, the Brakha settlers were out on the hilltop with bulldozers clearing more farmland. The settlement, home to about 1,300 religious settlers, was built in 1983 and is deep inside the occupied West Bank. Abdul Nasser Qadus, 51, father of Osaid, said it was &quot;beyond doubt&quot; that both children had been shot with live bullets. Standing next to him, Amar Qadus, 37, brother of Mohammad, said: &quot;Do you believe a 15-year-old boy is threatening Israel&apos;s security?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-03-21T20:04:57Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu flies to US for talks with Barack Obama as killings raise tension in West Bank", "sentences": ["&quot;From our point of view, construction in Jerusalem is like construction in Tel Aviv,&quot; he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/21/binyamin-netanyahu-obama-west-bank-israel"}, {"tags": ["Foreign policy", "Israel", "Hamas", "The Mossad", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "David Miliband"], "article": " 2.00pm: David Miliband is about to announce to the House of Commons the results of an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) into the abuse of British passports in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a Hamas official, in a Dubai hotel in January.

The timing is embarrassing for Israel as its prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is on a fence-mending mission in Washington. Relations with the US are frayed over Netanyahu&apos;s refusal to freeze all settlement activity in Palestinian territory. Reports from Israel say that the person to be expelled is the representative of the Mossad, Israel&apos;s intelligence service.  2.35pm: Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper reports that the Foreign Office made it clear to the Israeli ambassador, Ron Prosor, that the investigation had established for certain that the passports were forged when British citizens passed through airports on their way into Israel, with officials taking them away for &apos;checks&apos; which lasted around 20 minutes.  2.43pm: The BBC world affairs correspendent, Paul Reynolds, notes the ritualistic tone of these incidents.  New Zealand got angry with Israel in 2004 when two Israeli agents were found to be using New Zealand passports. Diplomatic ties were frozen, but were quietly resumed a year or so later after an Israeli apology. In 1987, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did order the closure of the Mossad station in London for a time - though no doubt it carried on in different ways - after the kidnapping of the Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu. But that did not affect her support for Israel and in due course, normal service resumed.    3.01pm: Miliband&apos;s statement to the Commons at around 3.30pm is expected to be brief, about 15 minutes. Then he will do the rounds of the TV studios to elaborate, refine and clarify. The Israeli ambassador, Ron Prosor, will then take his turn on the airwaves so this is going to last all afternoon. The Foreign Office will also brief. Assuming that Israeli intelligence was behind the hit, it may be wondering whether the diplomatic fallout is worth it.  3.12pm: Call it black humour. This is an Associated Press report picked up by Ha&apos;aretz a few weeks ago.  An Israeli supermarket is looking to cash in on the infamous surveillance video of an assassination team suspected of killing a Hamas commander in Dubai with a new commercial inspired by the footage. A new TV campaign for the Mahsanei Kimat Hinam supermarket chain shows actors wearing wigs and hats and carrying tennis rackets as they make their way through store aisles. &quot;We offer killer prices,&quot; announced the advertisement&apos;s tagline.    3.23pm: The Guardian&apos;s data blog has this useful graphic on the 26 suspects.  3.36pm: Miliband is starting his statement, a few minutes late. He says the UK is continuing to support inquiries, but the government has received a report from Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) this morning.  He says there is compelling evidence that Israel was responsible for the faking of the passports.  3.42pm:Miliband says Britain is profoundly disturbed that such action would be carried out by a friend. This, he says, adds insult to injury.  He notes the importance of UK-Israeli ties, but says he has asked for an Israeli diplomat to leave.  As for the 12 British citizens whose passports were copied, they are being issued with new biometric passports that will be more difficult to forge.  3.42pm: Miliband has finished and William Hague, his Tory shadow, voices support for the government and points out that Israel has done something similar in the past and has not lived up to past assurances not to do anything like it again.  3.44pm: Hague says Britain should ask for assurances that Israel will not repeat counterfeits and wonders whether British passports are more susceptible to forgery.  He adds that the government&apos;s action is right and has full backing of the House. Miliband is speaking again and notes that investigations in other countries, including the UAE. He says ruefully that no other country had so many passports forged in this &quot;sorry affair&quot;.  3.48pm: Ed Davey, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, says what took place was intolerable and praises Miliband for striking the right balance in this incident.  He raises the plight of Palestinians of Gaza.  3.51pm: Miliband expressed his appreciation for support from the other parties and stressed the narrow focus of the Soca investigation on the passport issue and not on the murder itself.  Sir Gerald Kaufman, a tough critic of Israel, spoke of Israel&apos;s &quot;serial crimes&quot; and added his praise for Miliband. It&apos;s unusual for such unanimity to be show in the House.  3.55pm: Miliband stresses that it is in Israel&apos;s interest to stick to international law.  In reply to the Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, the foreign secretary says the Foreign Office made a specific request as to who should leave from the Israeli embassy. In other words, the choice was not left to the Israeli embassy.  Labour MP Robert Marshall Andrews is broadening the debate by wondering when Britain will step up condemnation of Israel &quot;for stealing land and water&quot; from Palestinians.  4.00pm: We&apos;re straying from the issue, with the discussion wandering into identity cards. Here&apos;s PA&apos;s take on Miliband&apos;s statement.  Foreign secretary David Miliband said an investigation had discovered &quot;compelling&quot; evidence that Tel Aviv&apos;s secret service was responsible for cloning the ID documents.  He told MPs it was &quot;intolerable&quot; for a foreign country to behave in such a way, and the fact that Israel was a close ally added &quot;insult to injury&quot;.   4.02pm: The former Lib Dem leader, Menzies Campbell, wonders why Britain has not concluded that Israel was behind the killing itself.  Miliband says the investigation in Dubai is continuing and leaves it at that. Investigators in Dubai have said they are &quot;99%&quot; sure the Mossad was behind the murder.  4.05pm: Rob Marris (Labour) wonders why Britain considers Israel a friend when it disregards what Britain thinks. Miliband disagrees with this perspective.  4.08pm: Martin Linton (Labour) invites the government to take similar action each time Israel builds settlements. Another MP wants to know who Britain is expelling. Miliband declines to give any names, although reports say it is a representative of the Mossad. The House has now moved on to other business. Miliband&apos;s statement on the Foreign Office website says: &quot;Given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high quality forgeries were made, the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service.  &quot;Taking this together with other inquiries, and the link to Israel established by Soca, we have concluded that there are compelling reasons to believe that Israel was responsible for the misuse of the British passports.&quot;  4.30pm: First Israeli - rather sheepish - reaction. Israel&apos;s ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, said Israel was &quot;disappointed by the decision of the British government&quot; but affirmed his commitment to a relationship &quot;of mutual importance.&quot;  4.32pm: Prosor makes a short statement outside the embassy without taking questions. He says Israel&apos;s firm intention is to strengthen relationship with the UK. Now Miliband is on the BBC, once again refuses to name the official expelled. Says the UK has &quot;parted company&quot; with Israel on this specific issue. Adds that he has not received any apology from the Israeli government and says he has asked for Israeli assurances that it won&apos;t do anything like this again. &quot;Israel needs to understand&quot; that this should not happen again, the foreign secretary says.  4.39pm: Ha&apos;aretz reports that Miliband has also cancelled his appearance at a ceremony scheduled for later that evening at the Israeli embassy.  4.40pm: The Foreign Office has amended its travel advice for Israel, the gist of which is that your passport details could be nicked while travelling in Israel. The last line would be quite funny if it wasn&apos;t such a serious matter.  &quot;UK passport holders should be aware of a recent Serious Organised Crime Agency investigation into the misuse of UK passports in the murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in Dubai on 19 January 2010. The SOCA investigation found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports. This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. We recommend that you only hand your passport over to third parties including Israeli officials when absolutely necessary.&quot;   4.52pm: Miliband is really earning his keep today. He has just been on Sky News, saying there is no suggestion of a tit-for-tat retaliation from Israel. From what Prosor was saying, Israel is keen to keep this from escalating. Miliband repeats that the measures taken - based on careful investigations - are completelly justified.  5.02pm: Some diplomatic hair-splitting here. Gordon Brown&apos;s spokesman says the Israeli diplomat in question had technically been &quot;asked to withdraw&quot; from the UK, rather than expelled, and was being given two weeks to leave the country.  5.14pm: The question now is the identity of the diplomat who is being kicked out - well technically asked to leave. The answer will probably be in tomorrow&apos;s papers, but that&apos;s it for today&apos;s live blog. Thanks for your comments.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-23T14:06:43Z", "title": "Live blog: Britain expels Israeli diplomat", "sentences": ["Foreign secretary David Miliband said an investigation had discovered &quot;compelling&quot; evidence that Tel Aviv&apos;s secret service was responsible for cloning the ID documents."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2010/mar/23/israel-hamas"}, {"tags": ["Foreign policy", "Israel", "The Mossad", "Hamas", "UK news", "Politics", "Palestinian territories", "Dubai", "World news"], "article": "     David Miliband said today that there was &quot;compelling evidence&quot; that Israel was responsible for misuse of British passports as part of a plot to kill a prominent member of Hamas. The foreign secretary confirmed that Britain had demanded the withdrawal of an Israeli diplomat following the &quot;intolerable&quot; use of 12 forged British passports by a hit squad that killed the founder of Hamas&apos;s military wing in Dubai. Miliband attacked the &quot;profound disregard&quot; for UK sovereignty and said the apparent involvement of a friendly nation &quot;added insult to injury&quot;. Israel&apos;s ambassador to London, Ron Prosor, said he was &quot;disappointed by the decision of the British government&quot;, but pledged that the two countries would retain close ties. &quot;The relationship between Israel and the United Kingdom is of mutual importance,&quot; he said. Miliband&apos;s statement will be seen around the world as the first definitive allegation from a western government of Israeli responsibility for the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel in January. Today&apos;s developments follow an inquiry by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca). Mliband said inquiries were still under way in other countries and that it would not be appropriate for &quot;legal and other reasons&quot; to release the Soca report in full. But he said that, given the quality of the forgeries, it was &quot;highly likely&quot; that they were made by a state intelligence service. &quot;This, together with other enquiries, and the links to Israel established by Soca, [means] we have concluded that there are compelling reasons to believe that Israel was responsible for the misuse of British passports,&quot; Miliband told MPs in a statement this afternoon. Miliband said the UK government took the matter extremely seriously and had written to the Israeli administration seeking assurances that such misuse would never happen again. The misuse of UK passports not only presented a hazard to British nationals in the region but also represented a &quot;profound disregard&quot; for the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, the foreign secretary said. &quot;The fact that this was done by a country that is a friend with significant diplomatic, cultural, business and personal ties to the UK only adds insult to injury. No country or government could stand by in such a situation.&quot; Miliband told MPs that the Soca report had been studied by the prime minister and was presented to the cabinet earlier today. Soca had conducted an &quot;extremely professional&quot; investigation and all requests had been met by the Israeli authorities, he said. The evidence showed beyond &quot;any doubt&quot; that none of the 12 British citizens involved were anything other than wholly innocent victims of identity theft, the foreign secretary added. Biometric passports that would be considerably more difficult to counterfeit have now been issued to all but one of the British citizens, he added. Miliband also said the Foreign Office&apos;s travel advice for Israel would be amended to highlight the risk of papers being cloned, and how that could be minimised. A total of 12 British passports are alleged to have been forged. An initial six had the names of Michael Barney, James Clarke, Stephen Hodes, Jonathan Louis Graham, Paul John Keeley and Melvyn Mildiner. Last month, Dubai identified the use of a further six fake British passports with the names of Mark Daniel Sklar, Roy Allan Cannon, Daniel Marc Schnur, Philip Carr, Stephen Keith Drake and Gabriella Barney. A Foreign Office spokesman said the government believed their passport details had been used fraudulently. Other members of the hit squad travelled on fake Irish, French and Australian travel documents, Dubai police said. At least 15 of the suspected killers share names with Israeli citizens, fuelling suspicions that the Mossad was behind the hit. Interpol has published a wanted list of 27 people in connection with the killing. Miliband stressed today &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot; that the UK had no advance knowledge of the assassination and no involvement whatsoever in the killings. The expelled official is not being accused of direct personal involvement, officials said earlier today. The unusual step is intended as a gesture to reflect British anger. Al-Mabhouh, who established Hamas&apos;s military wing, was assassinated in his luxury hotel room in Dubai on 19 January by a team of killers wearing fake beards, wigs and other disguises. Dubai officials said they were &quot;99% certain&quot; that Mossad agents were behind the murder, but Israel has refused to confirm or deny the link. At the time Miliband branded the abuse of British passports &quot;outrageous&quot; and demanded that Tel Aviv cooperate fully with the UK&apos;s investigation. Prosor was summoned to the Foreign Office last month to discuss the situation, but he flatly denied there was any &quot;additional information&quot; to give. In 1986, a Mossad agent left an Israeli embassy envelope containing eight forged British passports in a German telephone box. Israeli diplomats were only expelled a year later after a Palestinian working as an Israeli double agent was found with a cache of weapons in Hull. Margaret Thatcher also closed down the Mossad&apos;s London base.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-23T17:17:00Z", "title": "David Miliband: 'Compelling evidence' Israel was behind misuse of UK passports in Hamas hit", "sentences": ["At the time Miliband branded the abuse of British passports &quot;outrageous&quot; and demanded that Tel Aviv cooperate fully with the UK&apos;s investigation."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/23/uk-expel-israeli-diplomat-passport"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The Mossad", "Dubai", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "Passing through Israel&apos;s Ben Gurion airport, a few miles east of Tel Aviv, is a unique experience no first-time visitor is likely to forget. It represents the pinnacle of modern aviation security. Baggage is passed through giant, state-of-the-art machines, and travellers \u2013 both arriving and leaving \u2013 are frequently subjected to lengthy, personal and repetitive questioning by officials, on their ethnic background and that of any local acquaintances they may have made. It is not at all uncommon for the mostly youthful immigration officers to wander off, passports and tickets in hand, ostensibly to consult with their seniors. Surrendering documents at check-in or at immigration has hitherto been considered a necessary evil for all those travelling in and out of Ben Gurion. But the evidence that the Israeli state has been taking the information gleaned from these inspections to create cloned identities for its spies introduces a new level of risk to the experience. The report by the UK&apos;s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) into the use of cloned British passports in the Dubai assassination makes clear their view that this is what happened as Britons travelled through the airport in the months and years before the plot was hatched to kill the Hamas commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. The Soca report concluded that the passports must have been cloned at the airport or at other interfaces with Israeli officialdom, such as airline offices in other countries. There were no other links between the 12 individuals whose identities were stolen. According to insiders, the language in the Soca report, produced after a four-week investigation, was &quot;direct&quot; and the findings unequivocal: the inquiry showed that the victims&apos; data was taken, stored and passed on when they handed their passports to Israeli officials or those linked to them. &quot;We cannot pin it on individuals, but the evidence draws us to the conclusion that the only place these passports could have been cloned is when they were inspected at the Israeli border or in other countries, where they were passed to Israelis,&quot; said one source. In some cases, this information theft had taken place several years before the assassination. One of the Britons involved told investigators he had not travelled out of Israel for more than two years. Soca concluded the report on their findings last week and handed it to the Home Office on Friday, which passed it to the Foreign Office on Monday. It then moved from the criminal sphere to the diplomatic, as the foreign secretary, David Miliband, translated the raw findings into concrete measures to be taken against Israel: the expulsion of a diplomat and a travel warning that Israeli officials were not to be entrusted with passports. The foreign secretary&apos;s decision to accuse Israel directly in parliament yesterday reflected both the certainty among British officials of Israeli state involvement, and the anger among diplomats and security officials at such a blatant infringement of British sovereignty. At least 12 British passports were used in the Mabhouh plot, more than any other nation&apos;s. That irritation was heightened by Israel&apos;s record. In 1986, eight British passports were found inside an Israeli embassy envelope in a West German telephone box, apparently left there by an absent-minded Mossad agent. The next year, a Palestinian found with an arms cache in Hull turned out to be a double-agent working for the Mossad, taking part in a covert operation Israel had omitted to tell Britain about. After investigating operations by the Mossad, the Thatcher government expelled an Israeli diplomat, Arie Regev, for &quot;activities incompatible with his status&quot;. And the Israeli government of the day gave an assurance that such transgressions would not be repeated. Today, Britain is looking for similar assurances. According to those close to the Soca investigation, detectives soon realised the passports involved were no ordinary forgeries of the type most often seen during inquiries into organised crime, terrorist support networks and money launderers in the UK and abroad. Most experts agree that British passports are notoriously difficult to forge, and those which do come to light are either poorly doctored originals, or passports created from fake documents. &quot;It is rare for us to see forged British passports,&quot; said one police expert. &quot;When we do, they are not often of the quality which could pass through an international border.&quot; So when investigators from Soca examined the details of the passports, they immediately noticed the difference. &quot;These were incredibly good forgeries. They are not the thing that anyone could do,&quot; said an investigative source. &quot;The originals were still in the hands of their owners and someone had used the information to create a new document. The quality of the forgeries made it highly likely that there was state involvement.&quot; The accusations will put considerable strain on Britain&apos;s relationship with Israel. But MI6, which pursued its own informal investigation into the affair, is likely to maintain its close, professional relationship with the Mossad. Key findings from the Soca investigation have been passed to the United States and to investigators in the United Arab Emirates, who are leading the inquiry into the murder of Mabhouh. To all intents and purposes the Soca investigation is now closed, although detectives may still be asked to provide additional information to the Foreign Office or the Dubai authorities.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-24T01:02:43Z", "title": "Britons queued at Ben Gurion airport as Israeli officials cloned passports", "sentences": ["Passing through Israel&apos;s Ben Gurion airport, a few miles east of Tel Aviv, is a unique experience no first-time visitor is likely to forget."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/24/israel-ben-gurion-cloned-passports-soca"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The cost of building Israeli settlements in the occupied territories stands at more than $17bn, according to a report released this week. The painstaking study into the economics of construction in the West Bank encompasses every building and road in the settlements, which cover a combined space of 12m square metres, and in doing so quantifies the enormity of the 43-year-old project of colonisation. Not included in the cost calculations are the vast military resources spent guarding the settler community, nor the massive subsidies dished out by the government to those dwelling east of the Green Line. Were those to be factored in, the cumulative price paid to maintain the settlement scheme would be far higher, demonstrating even further the tenacity of successive governments and electorates in ploughing on with the illegal venture. Much is made of the average Israeli&apos;s supposed antipathy towards the settlement enterprise, yet the facts on the ground tell a very different story. What began as a casually dismissed effort by a bunch of radicals on a windswept hillside in Samaria has morphed into a 500,000-strong unstoppable force \u2013 and all under the watchful eye of Israeli voters. Daniella Weiss, currently mayor of Kedumim and one of the most prominent settler leaders, was amongst the initial wave of settlers, and described to me the reaction of the non-believers to the Gush Emunim faithful&apos;s actions:  &quot;&apos;Who are these strange hallucinating people?&apos; they would ask. &apos;What are they doing [in these] Biblical hills? There&apos;s nothing there!&apos;... They thought they&apos;d be able to control us, to keep us in place and watch over us. They thought we&apos;d grow tired and go back to Tel Aviv\u2026 This was the start of Kedumim.&quot;  This early success was a shot in the arm for wave after wave of successive would-be settlers. Bolstered by the founding of Kedumim, they also drew strength from the reluctant acquiescence of the incumbent Israeli cabinet, headed by Yitzhak Rabin, to their activities in the West Bank. That the leftwing government of the day chose to pander to the movement, rather than to nip it in the bud, speaks either of incomprehensible weakness, or, more likely, of an unwillingness to give up the land that had a profound historical resonance for many Jews. However, Israelis&apos; gradual warming to the settler movement was not based simply on romantic notions of dwelling on the same soil as their ancestors 2,000 years previously. More pragmatic considerations swayed the majority of Israelis&apos; opinions, who were won over by constant propaganda claiming settlements were vital for the protection of &quot;Israel proper&quot;. In Weiss&apos;s eyes too, settlers are the soldiers on the front line, guaranteeing the safety of those back home: &quot;[We] represent something\u2026 this belief that we came here to stay for good. Whoever represents this gives life to the people who sit comfortably in the pubs [of Tel Aviv and elsewhere]&quot; Were ordinary Israeli citizens truly to believe the opposite, there is no way they would continue to accept their sons and daughters being sent to guard settlements during their compulsory military service. Likewise, there would be a highly vocal mass movement demanding an end to the settlement enterprise as a way to defuse tensions with the Palestinians and bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Instead, the political scene is dominated by rightwing, hardline politicians with little to no interest in bringing settlement activity to a halt, and those few leftwingers whose voices are carried by the local media are struggling to find a sizeable majority to back their calls for change. External pressure on Israel from the likes of the United States and European Union serves only to provoke a siege-mentality response from Israelis and plays into the hands of the paranoiacs on the Israeli right. Along with my co-author, I have been researching life in Israeli settlements for over two years, and a belief held by settlers in almost every town and outpost in which we stayed was that not only do they have the right to remain where they are, but that no government would now dare try to uproot them en masse. Many cite the disengagement as proof that not only would it prove beyond the government&apos;s means to try to enact a withdrawal 50 times larger than that which occurred in Gaza, but that subsequent events have shown that handing back land has only further endangered Israeli lives. Regardless of the truth of such claims, the fact that so many non-settler Israelis believe the hype means there is precious little objection to politicians&apos; business-as-usual approach towards West Bank settlements. The real task facing those calling for concessions from Israel is not preventing a few hundred homes being built in this or that settlement, but convincing Israeli citizens collectively once and for all that the entire settlement project is doing them untold harm. A 12m square metre dragon is far too big for any one knight to slay alone without backing from the Israeli public and their supporters overseas. Given the centrality of the settlement issue to the deadlocked negotiations, without a clear and concrete plan of action to reverse the settler tide the region is doomed to remain mired in stagnation. But stagnation in the mainstream political arena does not equate to stagnation in the settlements, whose leaders thrive on the inaction and indecision of other, weaker political forces. The scale and sophistication of today&apos;s settlements compared with their primitive forebears is a stark lesson in what can be achieved by radicals and rank outsiders if no one stands up to their misdeeds. Those who took their eye off the ball for the last four decades must not make the same mistake again, for the long-term good of every individual on both sides of the bitter conflict. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-03-25T10:00:00Z", "title": "The real price of Israel's settlements | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["They thought we&apos;d grow tired and go back to Tel Aviv\u2026 This was the start of Kedumim.&quot;  This early success was a shot in the arm for wave after wave of successive would-be settlers.", "Whoever represents this gives life to the people who sit comfortably in the pubs [of Tel Aviv and elsewhere]&quot; Were ordinary Israeli citizens truly to believe the opposite, there is no way they would continue to accept their sons and daughters being sent to guard settlements during their compulsory military service."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/25/israel-settlements-palestinian-territories-price"}, {"tags": ["British Airways", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Transport", "Trade unions", "Business", "Travel", "UK news", "Unite", "Heathrow airport"], "article": "A second strike by British Airways cabin crew is under way as the bitter row escalates between their union and airline management over jobs and cost-cutting. The Unite union said early indications were that its 12,000 members involved in the dispute were strongly supporting the industrial action, mounting picket lines outside airports for the second weekend in a row. But BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, said: &quot;The vast majority of BA staff, including thousands of cabin crew, are pulling together to serve our customers and keep our flag flying. &quot;At the same time I feel really sorry for those customers whose plans have been ruined by the Unite union&apos;s completely unjustified action. Despite the union&apos;s promises this strike has affected the Easter holiday plans of thousands of hard-working people.&quot; Hundreds of strikers gathered at a football ground close to Heathrow before being taken to picket lines around the airport. The airline said it would fly more than 75% of customers booked to travel during the four days of strike action. At Heathrow, BA said it would operate 70% of long-haul and 55% of short-haul flights, while keeping a full, normal schedule from Gatwick and London City airports. BA said about 18% of its passengers were booked on other carriers or had their dates changed to avoid the strike period. &quot;British Airways will do all it can to minimise the numbers of cancellations and will reinstate flights wherever possible if cabin crew come to work as normal,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;Customers were informed of cancellations five days ago and almost all of them will be able to fly on British Airways over the four days, change the date for another BA flight or travel with another airline where available. In some cases customers have also claimed a full refund. &quot;On Saturday morning our operations at Gatwick, where we aim to fly all flights as planned, have got off to a very strong start. At Heathrow we have got off to a good start. London City continues to operate as normal. &quot;Cabin crew are reporting as normal at Gatwick, just as they did last weekend during the first strike period. The numbers of cabin crew reporting at Heathrow are currently at the levels we need to operate our published schedule. &quot;This is the second part of the biggest contingency plan we have ever launched and our aim will continue to be to fly as many customers as we can.&quot; Unite has claimed BA will be left with a combined bill of \u00a3100m from both strikes, twice the \u00a37m a day that BA claims. Unite said BA had leased fully crewed planes from eight companies and was using volunteer pilots and management to stand in for striking cabin crew. Walsh stood firm on the airline&apos;s decision to withdraw travel perks from striking cabin crew, saying staff knew they would lose their travel concessions if they joined the three-day walkout last weekend. Unite accused BA of &quot;unacceptable anti-union bullying&quot; by taking away the travel perks. The union has insisted that any deal must include giving back travel concessions to cabin crew, as well as reinstating staff who have been suspended as a result of the dispute. This morning disgruntled passengers at Heathrow Terminal 5 complained about the disruption. John Cawley, 54, from Liverpool, said he would never fly with the company again. He, his wife and two sons were due to fly to Newark in the US before going on a cruise around the Caribbean but their internal flight between Manchester and Heathrow was cancelled, so they had to hire a minibus for \u00a3350 to get to London. &quot;It seems there are no certainties with BA at all,&quot; Cawley said. &quot;We&apos;re having to take this trip one step at a time. Once one bit is over we start to worry about the next one. There are question marks over everything.&quot; He said his travel agents had warned him the internal flight might be cancelled and advised them to arrange alternative travel. A number of BA customer support staff could be seen milling around the departure hall holding clipboards and giving advice. There appeared to be little disruption on the check-in boards, with only one flight listed as cancelled: an 8.30am service to Tel Aviv.

Twenty years after he joined BBC Television as a trainee, and by now its head of arts features, he applied successfully in 1971 to become controller of Radio 3. During his television career, Hearst had conceived of what was then a new format, the televised essay, attracting large audiences for series such as Kenneth Clark&apos;s Civilisation (1969) and Alistair Cooke&apos;s America (1972). Cooke always acknowledged the role Hearst had played in the success of the series and subsequent book, and they remained lifelong friends. But when Hearst went to Radio 3 soon afterwards, the appointment prompted muttering among radio&apos;s old hands, especially those of the music department who resented Hearst&apos;s aversion to the more intimidating modern works, likewise his disdain of over-technical introductions to any kind of music. Unlike some of his rivals, he believed that good audience figures were as important to a highbrow channel as they were to a pop one. His six-year reign from 1972 to 1978 duly saw many productive innovations, such as themed evenings \u2013 the first one came entirely from Paris \u2013 and a revival, in brighter vein, of the former Home Service&apos;s much-mocked The Critics, later called Critics&apos; Forum. Like two of those who now had to work closely with him, Martin Esslin and Hans Keller, Hearst hailed from Vienna, where his father was a dental surgeon. Because he was not only Jewish but also a known anti-Nazi agitator, he fled Austria immediately after the Anschluss in 1938, and eventually arrived in Britain. One of the reasons he came to the UK was because he was a lifelong Arsenal supporter and had seen them play in Vienna. Refugees were met by volunteers from kindly organisations. On his first evening in London, Hearst would recall, he was taken to the Savile Club and found himself shaking hands with HG Wells. He arrived to a Britain, he said, that appeared blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. He had done one year in medical school in Vienna, but, advised to study something short and useful, took a diploma in horticulture at Reading University. Scarcely had he qualified when war broke out and he was briefly interned in Reading jail (along with half the future Arts Council, he used to joke). He then joined the only wing of the British army then open to those who were technically its enemies, the Pioneer Corps. He was given five minutes to change his Austrian name, Hirshtritt, to an English version when he joined up. He saw action in the Italian campaign before being given command of a PoW camp in Gaza. There he discovered that many of his prisoners were musicians and arranged for them to give a concert in Tel Aviv. On demob in 1946 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, to read history. He did some freelance writing and toyed with the prospect of a career in Marks &amp; Spencer before winning his BBC traineeship. Initially he worked in the old prewar studios at Alexandra Palace. In the 1950s television mostly still went out live. One of Hearst&apos;s early tasks was to produce a topographical series with Christopher Chataway called Away From It All. For a visit to a Welsh slate quarry a sound-film camera was reluctantly made available. It turned out to be a monster the size of a small car that noisily ground its teeth whenever it was tipped at an angle. There were also hourly interruptions as a fresh load of slate was blasted out of the hillside. In the end, Hearst claimed, they left the monster in the middle of the quarry and hoped it would get blown up. In The Glory That Was Greece (1959), with Sir Compton Mackenzie, he got round such problems another way. Hearst took only a silent camera to Greece. Mackenzie worked out the enthusiastic things he would say about each fabled site without appearing in shot. Back in Ealing Studios he stood in front of a back-projection screen, a wind machine teasing his silver locks, to deliver his hymn to the scene around him. &quot;The glory may have been Greece&apos;s,&quot; wrote the wretched critic who revealed this, &quot;but the ingenuity was Ealing&apos;s.&quot; This programme (and a follow-up on The Grandeur That Was Rome with Sir Mortimer Wheeler) also indicated how Hearst was being drawn to the cultural sphere. In 1965 he started Sunday Night, a regular programme on artists and the arts to fill the gap left by the termination of Monitor, which Huw Wheldon had edited and presented since 1958, then was head of arts features (1967-71). An unexpected tribute to him at this time came from the gifted but scratchy dramatist-director Don Taylor, who was convinced that he had been blacklisted by the BBC&apos;s television drama department. In his memoir Days of Vision (1990), he recounts how he noticed the exciting and experimental work being done by Hearst&apos;s department, wrote to him and, after a short apprenticeship making documentaries about Shaw and O&apos;Casey and DH Lawrence, was allowed to smuggle his own thinly disguised plays into the output. After his controllership of Radio 3, Hearst ascended to the BBC heights where radio and television were seen as one medium, first as controller of future policy group (1978-82), then a special adviser to the director general. On retirement in 1986 he became an independent producer and consultant, and also a visiting professor at Edinburgh University. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was appointed CBE in 1980. He married Lisbeth Neumann in 1948. She and their son and daughter survive him. Leslie Megahey writes: To aspiring TV film-makers in the late 1960s, the newly formed arts department of the BBC was the place to be. Huw Wheldon&apos;s Monitor series had been a training ground for directors such as Ken Russell, John Schlesinger and Jonathan Miller, the new BBC2 channel was open for business, colour television well under way. In 1965 Stephen Hearst was appointed deputy to Humphrey Burton, the founding head of music and arts. Hearst had cut his teeth on documentaries. His award-winning film European Centre Forward (1963) told the story of a Shropshire miner who played for the Italian team Torino; football was one of his passions. He went on to produce arts series including the first regular programme on literature, Bookstand. When Burton left the BBC in 1967 for London Weekend Television, Hearst was put in charge of the arts output and of a new intake of trainees, including Tony Palmer, Alan Yentob and Nigel Williams. Stephen seemed to us, his young producers, a formidably moral man. He questioned motives and aspirations as if we were his own family, suspecting some of us, rightly, of aspiring to be the Jean-Luc Godards and Ingmar Bergmans of public service broadcasting. Nevertheless he had a gruff affection for the most exasperating of his young Turks, dispensing praise and disapproval with equal vigour. He claimed he could tell within 30 seconds of the beginning of a documentary whether or not its director was &quot;a born film-maker&quot;. Voluble and combative, he was also courteous and without affectation: during meetings his swimming trunks were to be seen hanging on his office radiator after his daily visit to Lime Grove baths. He came across primarily as a European intellectual of the old school, one of several talented emigres who found a home at the BBC. Years after his retirement, we arranged to meet at a restaurant near the BBC&apos;s Kensington House, where we had worked all those years ago. I walked in a little late, and before I had sat down he launched into: &quot;My dear fellow, good to see you, have you read the new biography of Wittgenstein?&quot; To his puzzlement, I laughed, and had to explain it was at the unthinkable notion of any present-day BBC executive starting up a lunchtime conversation on Wittgenstein. There are several considerable figures from that pioneering era of tele- vision, but few with Stephen&apos;s mix of critical judgment and personal warmth and none, in my view, who commanded more affection. \u2022 Stephen Hearst (Stephen Hirshtritt), broadcasting executive, born 6 October 1919; died 27 March 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-03-30T17:44:53Z", "title": "Stephen Hearst obituary", "sentences": ["There he discovered that many of his prisoners were musicians and arranged for them to give a concert in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/30/stephen-hearst-obituary"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "US news", "US Congress", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "America&apos;s main pro-Israel lobby group is mobilising members of Congress to pressure the White House over its bitter public confrontation with Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. The move, by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), appears aimed at exploiting differences in the Obama administration as it decides how to use the crisis around settlement building in Jerusalem to press Israel towards concessions to kickstart peace negotiations. Aipac has persuaded more than three-quarters of the members of the US House of Representatives to sign a letter calling for an end to public criticism of Israel and urging the US to &quot;reinforce&quot; its relationship with the Jewish state. The open letter, which has been circulating among members of Congress for the last week, says that while it is recognised that there will be differences between the two countries, they should be kept behind closed doors. &quot;Our view is that such differences are best resolved quietly, in trust and confidence,&quot; it says. The public differences, and revelations of Obama&apos;s private snubs of Netanyahu at the White House last week, have proved embarrassing to the Israeli leader at home, where he has been accused of undermining Israel&apos;s most important relationship. Signatories to Aipac&apos;s letter include Steny Hoyer, the Democrat majority leader, and Eric Cantor, the Republican whip. The wording is similar to an email Aipac sent out during Netanyahu&apos;s visit, describing Obama&apos;s criticisms of the Israeli government as &quot;a matter of serious concern&quot; and calling on the US administration &quot;to take immediate steps to defuse the tension with the Jewish state&quot;. But while Aipac has for years influenced US policy on Israel, by targeting members of Congress who criticise the Jewish state, it may no longer have the same impact. Robert Malley, a former special assistant to President Bill Clinton for Arab-Israeli affairs, said the administration&apos;s decision to take a once routine disagreement over settlement construction in East Jerusalem and turn it in to a confrontation is a reflection of the determination in the White House. &quot;This episode tells us more about the past and the future than the present. It&apos;s a reflection of the accumulated frustration and mistrust of the Netanyahu government by the White House. For the future, they&apos;re headed for a collision on the pace and nature of peace negotiations,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re seeing determination.&quot; A source, who is consulted by administration officials on Israel policy but did not wish to be named, said that having chosen to take Netanyahu on, Obama cannot afford to back away. &quot;The administration&apos;s credibility is at stake \u2013 in Israel and the Arab world. Netanyahu thought he had the better of it last year after he humiliated the president by rejecting his demand for a settlement freeze. If the administration does not follow through on this, or reaches some compromise that takes the heat off the Israelis, I suspect it will be almost impossible for us to get anything off the ground,&quot; he said. Netanyahu appears to have been caught off guard by Obama&apos;s stand, perhaps because he was overconfident of being able to bypass the administration by relying on strong support for Israel in Congress. But while Aipac has been able to mobilise support for its letter, Congressional leaders have remained largely silent on the substance of the dispute. That is, in part, because there is little enthusiasm for Jewish settlements. In addition, the White House has played an unusual card in suggesting that Netanyahu&apos;s intransigence is endangering US interests in the Middle East, and the lives of US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;So far, I&apos;ve been surprised by how muted congressional reaction has been,&quot; said Malley. &quot;It may come, but if the administration manages to portray this as an issue of US national interest, it may be able to sustain a level of criticism.&quot; However, there are reports of divisions within the administration on how to proceed. The US special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, and the national security adviser, James Jones, believe Israeli governments respond to pressure. Last year an Israeli diplomatic memorandum described Jones as having told European officials that the US administration would take a hard line with the government in Jerusalem. Some officials favour mapping out a blueprint for peace and pressing both sides to adopt it. But other officials argue against forcing Netanyahu to make compromises that will bring down his rightwing coalition. There has been criticism from Dennis Ross, who served as Bill Clinton&apos;s Middle East envoy. Now a Middle East strategist for the Obama administration, he is reported to be arguing for the White House to ease up on Netanyahu. However, Ross is regarded by some sceptics as too close to Israel. He has publicly argued that Jerusalem must remain undivided and is regarded with suspicion by the Palestinians, who saw him as effectively negotiating on Israel&apos;s behalf, rather than as a neutral mediator. Malley says that whatever the Obama administration does it is almost certain to lead to further confrontation with the Israeli government. &quot;The next crisis is more or less inevitable, given the diverging views of the Israeli and US governments on the pace and direction of the emerging talks,&quot; he said. War of words &quot;We must not be trapped by an illogical and unreasonable demand.&quot;  Binyamin Netanyahu, below, on Obama&apos;s demand for an end to settlement construction in East Jerusalem. &quot;I think at one point the [Israeli] prime minister added that he did not see a distinction necessarily between building in Jerusalem and building in Tel Aviv. We disagree with that.&quot;  White House spokesman on Netanyahu&apos;s reaction to the demand for an end to settlement construction. &quot;We recognise that, despite the extraordinary closeness between our country and Israel, there will be differences over issues, both large and small. Our view is that such differences are best resolved quietly, in trust and confidence, as befits long-standing strategic allies.&quot;  Letter signed by members of Congress pressing the administration to avoid such public disagreements.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-30T18:24:20Z", "title": "Israel lobby presses Congress to soften Obama's tough stance on Netanyahu", "sentences": ["&quot;I think at one point the [Israeli] prime minister added that he did not see a distinction necessarily between building in Jerusalem and building in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/30/us-israel-lobby-pressure-obama"}, {"tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Alon Hilu&apos;s 2008 novel The House of Rajani arrives in Britain having won the Sapir prize, Israel&apos;s equivalent of the Booker, and with praise from such divergent personalities as the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, and the novelist David Grossman. It spent three months on the Israeli bestseller list and sold 50,000 copies. But is this the same novel that was such a bestseller in Israel? On a number of levels, no. The title of the UK edition has been changed, and so too have the names of its two protagonists. In the proof copy I received and read at the end of January, the title was The House of Dajani and the main character Haim Margaliot Kalvarisky, a real-life Zionist pioneer of the 1890s. A preface claimed that what followed was a newly discovered diary, appended with pages from the diaries of Salah Dajani, a young boy who was a member of a well-known Palestinian land-owning family. An afterword indicated that this was a fiction, though Kalvarisky was a real if forgotten figure. The finished copy, having changed the name of the Dajanis and hence the title, includes the same preface but with the main character&apos;s name changed to the fictional Isaac Luminsky. The reason is that the descendants of Kalvarisky sued the author. They correctly pointed out that, having appropriated the name of a real person, he had, as novelists do, invented almost everything else. Thus the novel published in Britain is not quite the one published in Israel, and hence it suddenly resists my original objection that the author has interred under a novel the biography of a historical figure, no less successfully than Arab Jaffa has been interred beneath present-day Tel Aviv. The House of Rajani is a novel both postcolonial and postmodern, taking its readers back to the last decade of the 19th century and the early years of the Zionist project, when Jews from Europe were arriving in Palestine to buy up land from wealthy absent effendi, turfing off the tenant farmers. Salah Rajani is a disturbed boy who has terrifying visions of the enveloping catastrophe that will overtake both his estate and his people, while agronomist Luminsky arrives in Jaffa with his dentist wife and sets about a massive land-acquisition project. Luminsky, refused sex by his frigid, well-educated wife, has his eyes on both Salah&apos;s estate and his comely mother. Salah at first falls in love with the blue-eyed, blond, handsome Jew and writes lengthy, poetic accounts in his diary of the friendship between them. Meanwhile, Luminsky keeps a dated record of his attempts to seduce Salah&apos;s mother and get her to hand over the deeds to the land. Suddenly, Salah&apos;s father returns from abroad and equally suddenly dies. Salah becomes convinced that Luminsky, the beautiful stranger, has murdered his father and tells an Arabic version of Hamlet. Soon, Salah becomes Hamlet, vacillating between his homoerotic feelings for Luminsky and his hatred of him and the Jews and his desire for vengeance. A pair of Jaffa layabouts are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Salah is both Hamlet and Ophelia, and his mother successively Gertrude, Lady Macbeth and another Ophelia. The novel&apos;s power lies in its prophecy. Salah has a horrifying vision of &quot;a flock of birds sent to the skies by the Jews for the purpose of dropping explosive devices on Arab cities&quot;. He foresees his own end and that of his estate, buried under three towers, one circular, one rectangular and one a triangle, which all Israeli readers would recognise as Tel Aviv&apos;s Azrieli Centre, built in the 1990s. The topography of 19th-century Jaffa and its northern shoreline and inland estates is gradually buried under the contemporary urban geography of Tel Aviv, with the university supplanting a village, and orchards replaced by a five-star hotel and gay cruising ground. The novel&apos;s enormous popularity in Israel attests to a hunger to explore the truth of the mythologised past of Zionist narrative: to know who was there before and how they came to be expelled, long before wars or terrorism. One of the novel&apos;s marginal figures, an impoverished poet and drunk, is revealed to be the writer of the words to the Israeli national anthem, whose last line \u2013 &quot;Our hope is not vanished&quot; \u2013 turns out to be supplied by Salah in his last letter to Luminsky. Revelatory as this reopening of the interred past may be for Israeli readers force-fed on the victors&apos; version of history, the novel has a strongly didactic tone, as if one of the country&apos;s New Historians had turned their hand to fiction. The characters tend to be no more than purveyors of competing versions of Palestinian and Zionist history. The novel is a prophecy and a warning from the past to the future, and never quite escapes the tethers of its polemic. Salah&apos;s sections are told in long sentences that end in the reader&apos;s exhaustion at the end of the following page, though perhaps they have greater beauty in Hebrew.

The club was nominally owned by the invisible Ali al-Faraj, who was never seen at Fratton Park. For much of that period Daniel Azougy, a convicted fraudster and former lawyer who had been disqualified in 2002 and just last year pleaded guilty to handing false documents to the Israeli stock exchange, was in charge of the finances. He was joined by a collection of &quot;advisers&quot; and &quot;consultants&quot; that included Yoram Yossifoff and Roni Mana, both familiar names in Israeli business and property circles. Mark Jacob, a City lawyer at Fuglers who had known Yossifoff as a client for 15 years, was brought on board as executive director. The enterprise was funded by a \u00a317m loan from Balram Chainrai. His business partner Levi Kushnir was a familiar face at the club. All had various links with Arcadi Gaydamak, the former billionaire whose assets have been frozen and is exiled in Moscow after being found guilty of arms trading in Angola by a French court. Kushnir and Chainrai had successfully sued Gaydamak Sr for \u00a331m after he reneged on a share purchase, although they have yet to receive a penny. Mana, a middleman in many of Gaydamak&apos;s business deals, had also recently sued him over unpaid mediation fees and with his business partner Yossifoff had previously owned Maccabi Tel Aviv. It was Gaydamak&apos;s son, Sacha, who sold the club to Sulaiman al-Fahim after banks pulled their funding. Former chief executive Peter Storrie recently confirmed what many suspected at the time, but the Premier League was assured was untrue - that it was probably Gaydamak Snr&apos;s money that helped fund the club&apos;s reckless spending spree. Between October and January, the situation is described by those at the club at the time as &quot;chaotic&quot; as they staved off demands for payment from angry creditors, received conflicting instructions from the group in charge and sent payment requests to Azougy only to have them knocked back. Insiders paint a picture of a group who were simultaneously naive about the world of football but headstrong in their insistence on their arbitrary decisions being followed through, while revelling in their ability to invite friends and family into the boardroom for the visit of Manchester United. In the statement of affairs prepared by insolvency specialists Vantis at the behest of the high court in February, the company describes how it was originally called in at the beginning of January to try and get to the bottom of what was going on. &quot;Members of the executive board at the time, primarily Tanya Robins and Peter Storrie, asked us to re-attend the company&apos;s premises as they felt that their roles as executive directors were being undermined by a variety of consultants who did not have board positions but had Mr al-Faraj&apos;s authority to deal with financial affairs.&quot; Four days later Jacob, the solicitor installed by the al-Faraj regime as executive director, dis-instructed the company. Two weeks later, Robins resigned. Azougy was described by insiders as acting like a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot; who had full control of the finances until Chainrai became aware that money was being taken from the club&apos;s client account but he wasn&apos;t receiving any repayments on his \u00a317m loan. At that point the client account was switched from Fuglers to Balsara &amp; Co, the solicitors for Chanrai&apos;s company, and the Hong Kong-based businessman went on to seize full control of the club. While Chainrai, the Falcondrone group and Azougy \u2013 who has links to a loan shark who is reported to have made an offer of a $50m loan to Gaydamak Snr in return for his frozen assets \u2013 appear to have had common cause at the beginning of their enterprise, as they failed to secure a quick exit through a sale or new investment cracks began to appear. 2 What was Chainrai&apos;s involvement? Chainrai claims to have had no involvement in the running of the club in 2009, beyond providing the bridging loan, and recently said he regretted getting involved with al-Faraj and his &quot;associates&quot;. &quot;I must emphasise we had no personal or business relationship with Ali al-Faraj, Ahmed al-Faraj, Daniel Azougy or Mark Jacob, previously. And we only met them through Yoram Yossifoff after we had agreed to make the short-term bridging [loan]. I had no knowledge of who was in the consortium that owned Portsmouth,&quot; he recently told the Guardian. But the Premier League is understood to have retained suspicions throughout that chaotic period that Chainrai was more than just an arms-length lender. Portsmouth&apos;s administrator, Andrew Andronikou, said he was convinced that Chainrai was simply an unfortunate victim of circumstance and has no motivation beyond getting his money back. 3 Will HMRC get its money back? Despite dropping its vigorous opposition to the administration, HMRC retains concerns about the process. It is understood to have been reassured by a preliminary meeting with Andronikou and the other creditors but is unlikely to support a CVA if there remains a chance of recouping the full amount it is owed, at least \u00a315m. But as it holds less than 25% of the overall debt, it is likely to reluctantly support a CVA if it has no effective way of blocking it or feels there is no realistic alternative offer on the table. The court ruling that resolved HMRC&apos;s objections said an independent creditor&apos;s committee must meet by 26 March. It has yet to do so but informal meetings have taken place and HMRC is believed to feel reassured that it is &quot;in the loop&quot;. 4 What is Sacha Gaydamak&apos;s position? Gaydamak still owns key parcels of land around Fratton Park and claims to be owed \u00a330.5m in loans he made to the club before selling it to al-Fahim, making him the single biggest creditor. Andronikou appears to have satisfied himself that the figure is correct and says Gaydamak has been working constructively with him. 5 How much money flowed out of the club? The truth may never be known, given the opaque nature of the club&apos;s accounting between October and January. It is believed a sum of around \u00a31.5m was paid out from the Fuglers account in January, and it was that which prompted Chainrai to take more of an active interest in the running of the club. Meanwhile, Chainrai has confirmed that he also took a sum of around \u00a34m in part repayment of his loan from the club in January, weeks before it was placed into administration. 6 What is the true level of the club&apos;s debt? Andronikou has claimed that the true figure for the club&apos;s overall debt is more than \u00a3100m. The highest previous estimate was \u00a386m. But Andronikou said his figures were not inconsistent. He said he told a press conference on the day that he was appointed that the debts stood at around \u00a385m and that once the money owed to Chainrai is added to the total it comes to just over \u00a3100m. But on BBC Radio 5 Live&apos;s Sportsweek at the beginning of March, a few days after the club had been placed into administration, he said the debt would &quot;bottom out&quot; at \u00a378m. 7 Is Chainrai a secured creditor? HMRC has interpreted the latest court ruling as meaning Chainrai&apos;s charge does not confer secured creditor status. But that will become academic if the CVA is agreed \u2013 his debt will simply remain within the club and he will be repaid in full if a new buyer comes along. Other creditors will have to accept a settlement. Some fear that Chainrai could reap further rewards by siphoning off the parachute payments (at least \u00a316m), outstanding TV revenues and transfer income (up to \u00a325m) that will be realised in the summer. But Andronikou insisted Chainrai only wanted to recoup his existing investment and would be unable to take out more than he has put in. &quot;If he has put in \u00a314, he will only be allowed to take out \u00a314. I don&apos;t know where people have got this idea,&quot; he said. 8 Who is the mystery backer behind the proposed buyout? Property tycoon Rob Lloyd claimed to be close to agreeing a takeover when he met fans several weeks ago. But progress has been slow, fuelling suspicions that the administrator has been dragging his feet and raising concerns over Lloyd&apos;s seriousness. Lloyd has still not named the mystery investor who is backing the bid, but has apparently provided proof of funds. Last week, the consortium&apos;s accountants finally began the process of due diligence but Andronikou muddied the waters further by saying Lloyd&apos;s principal backer had changed. Today, he also claimed that their FA Cup semi-final success had raised the prospect of another rival bidder: &quot;We had one party who had shown interest, they were hovering, a real significant consortium with sporting interests, and this morning they came to step up their interest.&quot; 9 Will the administrator conduct a full investigation? On the one hand, Andronikou has promised to leave &quot;no stone unturned&quot; in investigating the murky events of the previous nine months. On the other, he has insisted that the club&apos;s past is &quot;irrelevant&quot; for now and far from a priority while he gets it back on an even keel. &quot;We&apos;re not subscribing to any conspiracy theories, we are trying to appease everyone and trying to get people to focus on their football. There will be a time and a place to deal with those questions,&quot; said Andronikou. Fan groups are asking how he can be so sure that Chainrai &quot;ticks all the boxes&quot; as a reluctant owner when he has not investigated the complex transactions of the previous nine months. &quot;The first priority is to get the club into an arena where it&apos;s considered to be safe and where I could turn around to the fans, the supplier base and creditors and say the club is going to survive. I&apos;m there anyway, to be honest. That will only be rubber stamped when the CVA is approved in a few weeks time. When it&apos;s approved, everyone can breathe a big sigh of relief. As regards how we got here, that&apos;s another chapter.&quot; He says it will be a &quot;few months&quot; before there are any conclusions, which would be confidentially delivered to the Department of Trade Industry, as is standard practice. 10 Is the administrator independent? After HMRC flagged up concerns over Andronikou&apos;s independence, noting in particular that Portpin, a company owned by Chainrai, and UHY Hacker Young, the insolvency practitioner of whom Andronikou is a partner, shared a solicitor in Balsara &amp; Co, the insolvency practice was quick to insist that there were no prior links. Andronikou insisted there was &quot;no stitch-up&quot;, arguing that the fact that it was Chainrai who had appointed him was &quot;irrelevant&quot;. &quot;There is no stitch up. My remit here is to get the best deal for the creditors. I&apos;m not here to work for Mr Chainrai, I need to get the best deal for all creditors,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-12T20:25:20Z", "title": "Ten questions about Portsmouth that remain unanswered | Owen Gibson", "sentences": ["Mana, a middleman in many of Gaydamak&apos;s business deals, had also recently sued him over unpaid mediation fees and with his business partner Yossifoff had previously owned Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/apr/12/questions-portsmouth-remain-unanswered"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza"], "article": "Blue and white Star of David flags are flying from cars and buildings all over the country as Israelis prepare to celebrate tomorrow&apos;s Independence Day holiday \u2011 their 62nd \u2011 first with sombre memorial ceremonies, then barbecues, fireworks, squeaky plastic hammers and searching reflections about past and present. It is about remembering the sacrifices of 1948 and later wars, marking national achievements, nostalgia \u2013 and having fun. But this year&apos;s is not the happiest of anniversaries: the hottest talking point of recent days is that former prime minister Ehud Olmert is suspected of involvement in a huge corruption scandal when he was mayor of Jerusalem. Controversy is raging too over the arrest of a young woman accused of a damaging security leak \u2011 about the army&apos;s killing of wanted Palestinian militants \u2011 to the liberal Haaretz newspaper, a row that underlines profound differences between right and left over media freedoms and patriotism. Prospects for what is still called the &quot;peace process&quot; with the Palestinians have never been so poor, while Barack Obama&apos;s determination to force a resolution of the conflict is unsettling to a country long used to near-unqualified support from Washington. &quot;Obama doesn&apos;t understand Israelis,&quot; is a common complaint. &quot;He&apos;s tough on the good guys but not the bad guys,&quot; is another. Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s grudging and temporary West Bank settlement moratorium and US and Arab fury over plans to build housing units in East Jerusalem are stark reminders that the core issues remain as intractable as ever. Even if Obama&apos;s envoy, George Mitchell, does manage to start &quot;proximity&quot; talks, no one knows how direct negotiations can resume. Many Israelis worry more about the nuclear ambitions of Iran&apos;s Holocaust-denying president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. These are widely seen, and officially presented, as posing the greatest danger to the Middle East&apos;s only (though still unavowed) nuclear power. &quot;We face two cruel possibilities,&quot; the rightwing military expert Ya&apos;akov Amidror commented in an eve-of-holiday newspaper article. &quot;Living with a nuclear Iran or setting the Middle East ablaze by attacking it.&quot; Officials and ordinary citizens complain of the &quot;de-legitimisation&quot; of the Jewish state. This comprises campaigns in Europe and the US for anti-apartheid-style boycotts, disinvestment and for bringing war crimes charges against Israeli politicians and generals. It all reinforces a sense of outraged victimhood that takes little account of the international impact of last year&apos;s war in Gaza \u2011 seen as self-defence against Hamas rockets by a majority of Israelis \u2011 in which 1,400 Palestinians were killed. So it&apos;s no surprise that the mood this independence day feels a tad subdued. &quot;Israelis are exhausted after 62 years,&quot; argues writer Yigal Sarna, sipping latte in a Tel Aviv cafe. &quot;People are fed up with the news. As far as most Israelis are concerned the conflict was over once the West Bank wall was built. It&apos;s a state of total denial. But at the end of the day this conflict is destroying us.&quot; Optimists in what remains of the Israeli peace camp see hope in the achievements of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Its prime minister, Salam Fayyad, is building a stronger economy and institutions that should be the nucleus of a future state, regardless of the political impasse. Western governments, in line with Quartet envoy Tony Blair, call this &quot;the only game in town&quot;. Critics sneer that propping up the PA is making it easier for Israel to maintain its 42-year occupation with Palestinian help. Surveying the events of the past year, the veteran Haaretz newspaper columnist Yoel Marcus urged Netanyahu to bow to Obama&apos;s pressure for substantive negotiations with the Palestinians \u2011 or accept the likelihood of an internationally imposed peace settlement before Israel&apos;s 63rd independence day. Historian Tom Segev has spent years arguing for a two-state solution but confesses that he has all but lost hope of progress, even if the president does eventually table his own peace plan. &quot;In principle the US can force us to do anything,&quot; he says. &quot;But it won&apos;t happen. There&apos;s no sense here that we have to make fateful decisions.&quot; On the Israeli right the mood is of defiance in the face of international pressure and the absence of any prospect for successful negotiations. Benny Begin, a hawkish Likud minister who Netanyahu cannot ignore, protests that the west is appeasing Iran, Syria and their allies, and that the mainstream Fatah movement is out to remove the &quot;Zionist presence&quot;, despite the PLO&apos;s formal commitment to a two state-solution. &quot;The notion of an independent sovereign Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] that is viable and peace-seeking is an oxymoron,&quot; Begin warns. &quot;I don&apos;t see the minimum military needs of Israel being met by a Palestinian state.&quot; Amid the celebrations, the bitter arguments about politics, peace and territory go on.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T13:02:20Z", "title": "Israel independence day overshadowed by controversy", "sentences": ["&quot;Israelis are exhausted after 62 years,&quot; argues writer Yigal Sarna, sipping latte in a Tel Aviv cafe."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/19/israel-independence-day-overshadowed-controversy"}, {"tags": ["Radio industry", "Television industry", "Media", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Iceland", "World news", "Europe", "Volcanoes"], "article": "5pm update: Simon Cole, chief executive of UBC Media, is working from a temporary office \u2013 AKA the Los Angeles branch of Soho House \u2013 after he was stranded on the west coast. We hear Cole will be attempting a &quot;daring escape&quot; tomorrow via Madrid. Three planes, two trains, and surely the occasional automobile along the way. His target: London by Friday afternoon. The Financial Times&apos; Gideon Rachman almost made it home from Tel Aviv last Thursday before the ash cloud struck and his plane was forced to return to the airport it had just left. Hopes of a flight to Marseilles were later dashed, and he made it by train to Rome (no word on whether he bumped into Kevin Marsh \u2013 see below) \u2013 and then on to northern Italy. &quot;As we went to press the writer was meeting his sister by the fountain in Geneva to pick up rail tickets to Lyon and then Paris. Prospects for crossing the Channel looked bleak,&quot; says an addendum on Rachman&apos;s blog. His FT colleague Stefan Stern was also trapped in Italy \u2013 by Lake Maggiore, which he reported was &quot;calm and still&quot;. Unlike travellers&apos; tempers, presumably. Finally, a Kevin Marsh update \u2013 it appears the former Today editor has finally reached London, four days after he left Las Vegas. &quot;I think I was lucky,&quot; he tweets. 3pm update: Few journeys home can be as epic \u2013 or recounted in such painstaking detail \u2013 as the one endured by Kevin Marsh, former editor of BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today and currently editor-in-chief of the BBC&apos;s college of journalism. Marsh was on business in Las Vegas when the volcano erupted. He has been making his way home ever since, as brilliantly recounted on his blog. He flew from Vegas to New York, and then from New York to anywhere in Europe that was still open (&quot;Turns out, only Rome&quot;). It wasn&apos;t an entirely comfortable journey across the Atlantic, though. &quot;My seat buddy is a living wheezing incarnation of American obesity. I&apos;m sure the dismay shows on my face as I approach and I am a lesser person for that.&quot; He heads to Rome railway station, where his credit card fails him, but he finally catches a train to Milan where his wife has booked him a hotel &quot;at a ridiculous price but it is the only option&quot;. From Milan he considers a taxi to Geneva, but only if it costs less than \u20ac750, turns down the offer of a shared taxi to Paris, and bags a first-class seat to Zurich. Still with us? From Zurich he travels to Koln in Germany, where his son has booked him another hotel room. &quot;There is a strange, alien smell. It is me.&quot; It&apos;s not entirely clear whether Marsh has made it home yet \u2013 perhaps he will email us \u2013 but the plan was to travel to Brussels \u2013 on another train \u2013 and home to London on Eurostar. Let&apos;s hope he&apos;s home. And had a bath. Marsh&apos;s BBC colleague, Radio 2 DJ Stuart Maconie, has also been enjoying the European rail system after he was stuck in Venice. His journey, judging by the DJ&apos;s tweets and occasional picture, has been rather less stressful. &quot;Brescia. Green mountains. Quite tall buildings. Average football team. You can tell I&apos;m a travel writer can&apos;t you?&quot; Tuesday AM It may have grounded planes across Europe, but not even a giant volcanic ash cloud, it seems, can keep Chris Moyles off air. The Radio 1 DJ, marooned in New York as we reported yesterday, was still able to host today&apos;s breakfast show after he decamped from his hotel room to the studios of Sirius satellite radio in the city. But it meant he had to start broadcasting slightly earlier than usual, beginning his show at 1.30am New York Time. &quot;I&apos;m enjoying being back on air ... Hope you are!&quot; tweeted Moyles. &quot;Although the time difference is mental. Fun though.&quot; Other media people affected by the travel chaos resulting from the Icelandic eruption include the Daily Mail columnist Allison Pearson. She told today how she is stuck in Oman &quot;with my friend Joanna, my daughter Evie and her friend Chloe&quot;. &quot;A girls&apos; own adventure has turned into an unwanted adventure,&quot; wrote poolside Pearson. &quot;Granted, our plight is hardly on a par with those who have been sleeping on railway platforms, or clinging to bus rooftops for a 600-mile journey across the Alps.&quot; Try telling that to the Mail&apos;s headline writer: &quot;When paradise turns to hell&quot;. Hell indeed. Fortunately the TV presenter and intrepid explorer Ben Fogle has managed to make it home after he was marooned in Ethiopia, but only after an epic five-day journey on planes, trains and automobiles. Every volcanic ash cloud has a silver lining, though, as he writes up his experiences for today&apos;s Daily Telegraph. Let&apos;s hope it paid for at least one of those plane journeys, possibly two. And two members of the stage version of Hi-de-Hi! were stranded in France and the Maldives respectively, reports the Independent.

Almost all restrictions in Europe have been lifted by air traffic controllers, however there remain some closures of airspace over parts of Britain, Ireland and France. Elsewhere today Giovanni Bisignani, head of the International Air Transport Association, called the economic fallout from the six-day travel shutdown &quot;devastating&quot; and urged European governments to examine ways to compensate airlines for lost revenues, as the US government did following the 11 September 2001 attacks. He said it would take three years for the industry to recover from the week of lost flying time. Airlines lost $400 million each day during the first three days of grounding, Bisignani told a news conference today. At one stage, 29% of global aviation and 1.2m passengers a day were affected Back in the UK the transport secretary, Andrew Adonis, has denied that the government decided to reopen the skies to air travel under pressure from airlines. &quot;They have obviously wanted to be able to fly their planes of course they have but that has not been the issue at stake here,&quot; he told the BBC today. And a last bit of travel advice - both the Heathrow and Gatwick express will be running throughout the night to ensure passengers affected by flight restrictions can make it to and from the airports. Thanks for reading, and for the emails and comments  5.59pm:  Now look out for a row which is brewing over airlines bid to end rules that oblige them to help stranded travellers - see 3.39pm. Consumer group Which? while recognising no one could have foreseen the last week when the rules were drawn up, told my colleague James Meikle this evening: &quot;Without legislation we would have thousands and thousands of people stranded abroad without means of getting home, and without being looked after.  &quot;While we understand airlines are not to blame for anything that has happened over the last 7 days, passengers are consumers, and they need to be protected when something goes wrong.&quot;  5.54pm:  TUI Travel, whose chief executive earlier today described the governments response to the crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot;, (see 2.20pm) has calmed down. Dan Milmo&apos;s just forwarded me this statement:  &quot;Today, TUI Travel PLC and Thomas Cook Group PLC held a constructive meeting with the Transport Secretary which focused on the repatriation of stranded customers following the closure of airspace as a result of volcanic ash. We are pleased that Lord Adonis has recognised the importance of repatriation and the efforts we have undertaken in this area. We welcome the call for similar efforts across the rest of the travel sector. Separately, the companies have met with the Civil Aviation Authority and recognise their efforts in engaging with manufactures which has resulted in the new guidance issued yesterday, that has allowed air space to reopen.&quot;  And now they&apos;ve stopped criticising the government, transport secretary Andrew Adonis has recognised the &quot;great efforts&quot; made by travel companies. His statement:  &quot;I recognise the great efforts that tour operators are making to bring their customers home as quickly as possible and I want to see similar efforts made across the rest of the travel sector.&quot; &quot;Tour operators make a huge contribution to UK Plc. I have held productive discussions with the industry leaders today and will maintain a continuing dialogue over the coming hours and days.&quot;   5.40pm:  Severin Carrell has forwarded a statement from Highlands &amp; Islands Airports - which runs all Scottish airports north of Aberdeen and Glasgow - that serves as a reminder that the ash isn&apos;t completely gone yet.  &quot;HIA regrets to advise that all scheduled Loganair services from the current time until at least 13:00 hrs local time on Thursday, 22 April have now been cancelled. &quot;The continued presence of significant levels of volcanic ash in many parts of Scottish airspace \u2013 including &quot;no-fly&quot; zones ordered by the CAA and National Air Traffic Services which now cover Stornoway, Shetland and Orkney \u2013 and the forecast for tomorrow shows no material change for Loganair&apos;s operations.&quot;  &quot;This means all its islands services to the Inner Hebrides, Western Isles and northern Isles have been cancelled,&quot; says Severin.  5.24pm:  My colleague Andy Pietrasik emails:   EasyJet will today and tomorrow operate 15 special rescue flights to and from the UK to bring home passengers whose flights have been cancelled over the last week due to airspace closure. The airline has chartered additional aircraft over the next few days to collect passengers from Sharm El Sheikh, Madeira, Malta, Malaga and Alicante from its UK hubs. It says this will allow it to carry an additional 3,000 passengers who are stranded abroad. The flights are only for passengers who have previously had their booking cancelled. They should go to easyJet.com and log into the &quot;My easyJet&quot; section to transfer on to the new flights.   5.06pm:  Upbeat video/slideshow from fionahawthorne charting her family&apos;s journey to London from the south of Spain via &quot;hire car, coach, metro, train and ferry...&quot;  Set to the music of &apos;Red Plastic Bag&apos;.             .  4.38pm:       Sam Jones has been talking to people at Heathrow:  &quot;Mick Cutler&apos;s journey home may not have been quite such an odyssey, but the event that preceded it certainly was. Cutler, a 38-year-old NCO in the RAF, had just finished a 14-day, 1607-mile bike ride from San Diego in California to Galveston in Texas with five air force friends when the cloud put paid to their homeward plans. &quot; We should have been flying back on Saturday, but we got out in the early hours of Tuesday and we missed the open airspace last night and got diverted to Nice. Then we were put up overnight in Nice and looked after very well by BA. Being away for three weeks with a family waiting at home was tricky, then there was the uncertainty of not knowing when we would get here. We just had to make the best out of a bad situation really, but we were all anxious to get home as quickly as possible. British Airways picked up a lot of it. They were looking after us but there were the odd bits and pieces \u2013 like toiletries \u2013 that we had to buy, and obviously there was our washing and things like that. I probably spent about $150 and then about 100 Euros in Nice as well. I&apos;m looking forward to meeting up with the family. I&apos;ve got two young boys who kept asking when I was coming home. I&apos;m lucky that I have a very understanding wife. She&apos;s over the moon now.&quot; The scene upstairs in departures, under Terminal 5&apos;s massive steel and glass roof, was a little different. Huge electronic screens advising people to check their flights online did not seem to have stopped hundreds of travellers from turning up and trying their luck. Others had no choice. Conrad Seidel, a 23-year-old student from Stuttgart, was passing the time by playing slaps with his new friend Anna Schwalm, 20, from Frankfurt, who he had met while they were stranded in Vancouver. Although they were on the first flight back into Heathrow last night, which touched down at ten to 10, the young Germans were still a little way from home. &quot;We were always on standby in Vancouver - for five nights,&quot; said Conrad. &quot;We got here on the first flight \u2013 at 10 o&apos;clock last night. I should have been at university a week ago; I thought I&apos;d get there last week, but I got stuck. We slept here last night.[British Airways] gave us blankets and I wrote all my professors and they said it was fine. We&apos;re exhausted. I really want to emphasise that BA did a great job. It wasn&apos;t their fault \u2013 it wasn&apos;t a strike or anything. They kept us up to date and gave us a hotel and food vouchers and came to out hotel to tell us what was happening. British Airways honestly did a really, really good job. I would definitely go with them again. Other airlines just said: &apos;Ring this number.&apos;&quot;   4.22pm:  My new Twitter friend lefran, stuck in Japan, has some advice for anyone trying to get hold of KLM:      @lefran @adamgabbatt nothing worked for me until i contacted KLM on twitter, i&apos;d suggest everyone flying with KLM to get in touch with them on twitter because it took me 2 hours to get hold of them on the phone for them to say they wouldnt help, 10 minutes on twitter!  4.12pm:  Just been on the phone to the Guardian&apos;s Sam Jones, who&apos;s been at Heathrow Terminal 5 today.  &quot;The Sun has a couple of &apos;page 3 stunners&apos; welcoming people back into the country and giving them a little carrier bag with a copy of the Sun in.  This afternoon I met people who got the first flight in from Vancouver at 9.50pm last night, but were still having to rough it in the airport until they could catch their next flight out.  It doesn&apos;t feel very busy at all in arrivals, photographers and members of the press aside, but it&apos;s a bit busier upstairs in departures. But overall it&apos;s very calm, with not many people about.&quot;   4.01pm:  James Meikle has forwarded me a handy FAQ by Stewart John, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and past President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. &quot;The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch.&quot; \u2022 How do we know how much ash an engine can cope with? &quot;No-one knows the answer to this. The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch. Some ash will go straight through the engine without having any effect whilst some will get caught up. The speed, density of ash cloud, size of ash particles, temperature and wind all have an impact \u2013 in short there are just too many variables and it&apos;s extremely difficult!&quot; \u2022 Does ash affect the fuel efficiency of an engine? &quot;Ash only affects fuel efficiency if it starts clogging up the airways. The engine would fail before fuel efficiency became a real problem.&quot; \u2022 What has been learned from the test flights? &quot;Everything! They are what have shown that the flights are safe. They are the ultimate practical test and if there can be any criticism of this it&apos;s that there weren&apos;t test flights being done under controlled conditions right from the moment this crisis started.&quot; \u2022 On what evidence are the new CAA rules based? &quot;They&apos;re based on the results of the test flights. It&apos;s essentially a case of suck it and see.&quot; \u2022 What ash-damage checks will airlines have to make? &quot;Ash-damage will be checked extremely carefully. From the outside they will look at the fuel, air and oil filters. As well as this they will use borescopes to assess any internal damage to the engine. They have very sophisticated methods for doing this now and engines are designed with holes for borescopes for use in routine inspections. All these tests are objective tests that can be tested factually rather than subjective ones, so it&apos;s extremely rigorous.&quot; \u2022 Why can we fly now when days ago the advice said &apos;no tolerance for any ash whatsoever&apos;? &quot;The rules that said don&apos;t fly through ash were put in place a long time ago and it&apos;s basically been a case of updating them. You&apos;ve got to remember that thirty years ago no-one would have considered flying a twin engine across the Atlantic \u2013 you&apos;d have had to have four engines. New rules were made as part of EROPS (Extended range over water Operations) and at first twin-engine aircraft were never allowed to be more than 60 minutes from land, then 90 and eventually 240. Recently I was in a twin-engine plane that made the 16 hour flight to Hong Kong. Even 10 years ago we&apos;d never have done this. We&apos;d never faced this ash scenario before and it&apos;s been a case of learning to update \u2013 rules change as we get more confident and learn more about what we can do. It&apos;s just like a baby learning to walk. You move with the times as you gain confidence.&quot;  3.51pm:       Severin Carrell has an update on the situation in Scotland:  Aberdeen airport is still &quot;very much open and operational&quot; despite a new flying ban now affecting northern Scotland and the North Sea, a BAA spokeswoman has said.Three airports, on Orkney, Shetland and at Wick in Caithness, have been closed since 1pm after national air traffic control warned of a new ash cloud. The same plume led North Sea helicopter operators to suddenly ground all their oil and gas platform flights from Aberdeen after two Bond helicopters found ash coating their windscreens.But Sarah Campbell, a BAA spokeswoman at Aberdeen, said that only the far north of Scotland was affected; helicopter flights had now started again to the east and south-east. The only passenger flights grounded were to Lerwick, Kirkwall and Wick.&quot;Aberdeen airport is still very much open and operational. This afternoon a couple of routes have been affected by conditions to the north so there have been some cancellations but the majority of our routes are normal just now,&quot; she said.   3.39pm:  The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, which represents over 90 airlines, has called on the UK government to tackle the EU Commission over unfair EU Regulations against member state airlines. Mike Carrivick, BAR UK chief executive, said today that regulation that forced airlines to provide for passengers during the disruption should not have been applicable in this case. He said the regulation was never meant to &quot;wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time&quot;. Full statement:  &quot;The eagerness of the EU and the UK government to publicly state that airlines have a responsibility under EU Regulation EU261/2004, to accommodate and feed passengers booked on flights cancelled by the volcanic disruptions, is a misuse of the regulation. &quot;Regulation EU261/2004 was intended to apply when airlines had individual delays or cancelled flights. It was never intended to apply to wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time. It is also relevant that airlines cannot immediately resume normal services from the moment that the airspace restrictions are lifted. This Regulation, when used in this way, is draconian, disproportionate and often impractical. &quot;In this particular situation, passengers have in all probability been delayed a lot longer than they might have been and airlines have lost millions every day as a result.&quot;   3.31pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Thomas Cook has confirmed that one of a rescue flight to Crete had to return to Manchester airport today after a technical fault. It insisted that the reason for the return was &apos;purely a precaution&apos; and had nothing to do with ash, but the pilot remarked on the &apos;intense&apos; smell of volcanic ash before the flight was sent back.  &apos;For information we got the smell of the ash from about 16,000ft in the climb,&apos; the pilot said in a recording spotted by Airline Industry Review.  A Thomas Cook woman said: &apos;Safety is of paramount importance to us so when the Thomas Cook Airlines TCX 952P developed a minor technical fault with its air conditioning, we took the decision to return the aircraft to Manchester as a precautionary measure. The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger. The plane will be back in service later today and will join the many Thomas Cook Airlines rescue flights currently returning stranded passengers to the UK.&apos;&quot;  3.27pm:       Stankle is unimpressed with Monarch:   @kimmiedunja  I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet I&apos;ll tell you; a friend of mine had her return journey to portugal booked through Monarch. When flights were first cancelled, monarch&apos;s response was &quot;you&apos;re on your own love - not our problem&quot;. Now flights have restarted - they kindly offered to fly her and her daughter back from portugal for \u00a31k.   3.21pm:  My colleague James Meikle has been given the latest figures on Heathrow&apos;s operations today.  Normally the airport would have 657 departures today, but the plan at the moment is for 422. It would normally have 655 arrivals, but the plan at the moment is for 343.   3.07pm:       kimmiedunja comments on the TUI/Thomas Cook criticism of the government (see 2.20pm):  Have to say I&apos;m with the TUI bosses here. Mum and her husband have been stuck in Cyprus with Thomson and although they haven&apos;t had much information from the tour operator they have been extremely well looked after: staying at the same (posh) hotel rather than being downgraded to save Thomson money, moved from half to full board, and increased entertainments etc to keep the stranded happy. My maternal grandmother was rushed to hospital whilst mum was away, and she has been duly anxious - so Thomson have ensured she&apos;s on the first flight back, and should land at Manchester in a couple of hours. I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet.   2.58pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Here&apos;s a great idea for anyone who&apos;s bored waiting for a plane: Andrew Losowsky, currently stranded in Dublin, is trying to put together a magazine written by and for &quot;fellow strandees&quot;. Working titles include Grounded, SkyFail and Someday We&apos;ll Fly Away.  Blogging from the airport he writes: &quot;If all goes well, the results will be published, probably via MagCloud and/or the Newspaper Club, and any proceeds sent to a charity that helps mitigate the effects of climate change on human populations. After all, we have to repent somehow. Who&apos;s in?&quot; Strandees are invited to answer four questions.&quot;  2.53pm:  jmbriggs, first name John, has been keeping a video diary of his volcano-affected journey from Riga to London on YouTube. Here&apos;s an entry from the room of his ferry from Lithuania to Germany. John suspects his travel companions have been accusing him of sounding like a warthog, which seems a little unfair.             Elsewhere the Guardian has a gallery of images taken as flights resumed today.  2.39pm:  Guardian travel editor, Andy Pietrasik, emails:  Iceland Express has started to resume flights between Reykjavik and London. Iceland Express was the first airline to leave London Gatwick at 01:35 on 21 April 2010. The flight carried 62 passengers to Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik, onboard a Boeing 757-200.   2.36pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Gordon Brown appeared to hint that some night flights, or a relaxation of flight time rules, might be possible to get stranded passengers back. &apos;Now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you&apos;ll find our airports are open longer to make that possible,&apos; the PM said at an election meeting in Cardiff recorded by ITN. He was also evasive about those illusive coaches in Spain. &apos;There are coaches for people in Spain if they need it, but most people will want to come back via the airline or the charter that they have already booked,&apos; he said.&quot;             .  2.33pm:  National Express is providing nearly 3000 coach seats to/from Dover and London today, a press release has just announced. &quot;A new 24-hour coach operation has been put in place tonight from Dover to help those arriving from Calais throughout the night to get home. 20 different departure times will depart to London where onward UK connections can be made.&quot; Here&apos;s the timetable for services from Dover to London: 0455, 0525, 0625, 0725, 0835, 0930, 1015, 1115, 1215, 1315, 1415, 1515, 1615, 1715, 1825, 2010, 2200, 0000, 0200, 0330 For people aged 16-59 it&apos;s \u00a313.90, a spokeswoman has just told me. Under 16s, people 60 and over and disabled can travel for \u00a36.95. The coach brings you in to London Victoria, where &quot;connections to 1000 UK destinations can be made&quot;.  2.20pm:  Is the government letting Ryanair and easyJet get away with abandoning passengers? That&apos;s what TUI Travel and Thomas Cook appear to be suggesting, writes Matthew Weaver:     Matthew Weaver    &quot;The chief executive of TUI travel, which owns Thomson and First Choice, has described the government&apos;s response to the volcanic ash crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot; in a joint statement with Thomas Cook this afternoon. &quot;It became apparent that the government is condoning a two tier system between the way low cost airlines and airlines of holiday companies operate,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Some low cost airlines stated that their focus would be to commence normal flying schedules as soon as possible and made it clear that it was the government&apos;s responsibility to repatriate their customers. We believe this is a flawed and inequitable approach that is to the disadvantage of consumers.&quot; &quot;It is clear that the Government has put no pressure on low cost airlines to implement their own equivalent repatriation plans,&quot; the statement added. In the statement the two companies contrasted the conduct of low cost airlines with the efforts they have made to bring passengers home. &quot;TUI Travel and Thomas Cook immediately activated their crisis plans when the full implications of the volcano eruption became clear last Wednesday 14 April. Due to airspace being closed, over the weekend TUI Travel repatriated customers via coaches, ferries and owned cruise ships. First Choice and Thomson are now repatriating 21,000 customers today and 32,000 tomorrow with the remainder of its customers being repatriated by Friday.&quot; Peter Long, TUI travel chief executive said: &quot;The Government&apos;s response to the crisis has been a shambles. It is clear that they underestimated the severity of the consequences of the decision for a blanket closure of the airspace for such a protracted period of time.  &quot;This has been compounded by the fact that they have neither put in place a viable repatriation plan or ensured that the industry behaves in a consistent and responsible manner.&quot;  2.05pm:       Severin Carrell with the latest on the North Sea airspace:  North Sea helicopters have been grounded and flights from Aberdeen banned again after the ash plume shifted again, closing air space north east of Peterhead in north east Scotland. The North Sea helicopter operator Bond said two of its aircraft encountered ash in rain clouds 70 miles offshore: they landed to find a coating on ash on their windscreens, but there were no deposits in their engines. &quot;A no fly area has been imposed again,&quot; a Bond spokesman said. The new closure will increase pressure on the oil and gas industry&apos;s system of rotating workers on and off their platforms: for the last five days, many flights have been replaced by slower and more demanding boat trips to the rigs.   2.00pm:  Matt Weaver has spotted that the Foreign Office is using Twitter to offer guidance to Liverpool fans traveling to Madrid for the game.      @ukinspain #Liverpool_Atletico: We&apos;ll be tweeting advice for fans tomorrow so follow us on your mobile (check your operator&apos;s charges).  1.54pm:       Giles Tremlett, our Madrid correspondent at Barajas airport emails:  Foreign office minister Chris Bryant was one of the first members of the government to start flying today, reaching Madrid this morning to study the &quot;hub&quot; operation set up for stranded Britons in the Spanish capital.  Between ten and twenty coaches will leave from Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport Terminal 4 for Channel ports during the day.  &quot;I really don&apos;t want to pretend that we can do everything because we can&apos;t,&quot; Bryant told the BBC. &quot;The main thrust now has to be by the airlines and tour operators.&quot; The embassy has a desk set up in the departures hall where people are joining the queue to get on the buses. Passengers are a mix of those who have been stuck in Madrid for days and others arriving on intercontinental flights.  Two coaches have left already, with two to three drivers on each coach to go straight through to Calais. Free bottles of water, but no toilets on some of them. The drivers say it will take them around 17 hours to Calais.   1.50pm:  Severin Carrell emails to confirm North Sea helicopter flights have been grounded \u2013 showing the plume is heading south again, potentially affecting more services.  We&apos;ll keep you posted.  1.39pm:       Tommyben: &quot;If you have a long wait for a flight it might still be worth going by land and water as most trains and ferries have capacity. Have a look at www.flightlesstravel.com for some alternative travel routes.&quot; The FlightlessTravel website is worth looking at. They have tips on travelling by cargo ship, which sound great fun.  1.30pm:  Rail lines serving London&apos;s airports will stay open around the clock tonight to help get stranded air passengers home, Network Rail has announced. Weekend engineering work on the Anglo-Scottish routes - the east and west coast main lines - has also been cancelled to enable more direct services to run. Robin Gisby, from Network Rail, said: &quot;Network Rail and the train operators are doing all we can to help get people home following the unprecedented air travel chaos. The main lines to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports will be opened round the clock tonight in an effort to speed people on their way.&quot; Paddington, Liverpool Street, Victoria and Gatwick - some of the UK&apos;s biggest and busiest stations - will also stay open around the clock tonight. So does this mean the tube will also be running, for the thrifts (like myself) who prefer to endure the hour-long Piccadilly? &quot;No,&quot; a spokesman for Transport for London has just told me. &quot;That&apos;s following consultation with the department for transport, and with other services like the Heathrow express, Gatwick express, etc, to understand what the demand is likely to be,&quot; he said. &quot;The tube runs up until midnight, and we did have plans in place to run the Piccadilly line into west London should that be necessary, but it does not appear, according to the Department for Transport, that there will be large numbers of people arriving overnight.&quot;  &quot;We do have an extensive night bus operation in London that will continue to operate, and we continue to monitor the situation. If the DfT ask us to run the service we will be able to do so.&quot;  1.18pm:      Terror as plane hits ash cloud [28 years ago]    How&apos;s this for responsible reporting? Copies of today&apos;s Daily Star have been removed from airport newsagent shelves over fears that its splash, headlined &quot;Terror as plane hits ash cloud&quot; with an image of a 747 with engines ablaze, could cause panic among travellers. Behind the headline is a picture of a Boeing 747, engines blazing. A picture which was taken from a TV reconstruction of an incident 28 years ago in which BA Flight 009&apos;s engines were knocked out by a volcanic ash cloud. Full story from John Plunkett.  1.12pm:  Good afternoon all, Adam Gabbatt taking over from Matt, who&apos;s gone for some soup. Right on cue, Severin Carrell calls back to elaborate on the airspace closures in north and west Scotland.  Airspace above the North Sea could also be closed to low level flights due to the volcanic ash, potentially affect the oil and gas industry.        12.54pm: Dan Milmo writes:  &quot;The head of the UK air safety body has denied that pressure from ministers and airlines contributed to the surprise lifting of a flight ban last night. Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said it was &quot;absolutely 100% untrue&quot; that the independent regulator had been leant on.  In an interview with the Guardian he said the transport secretary, Lord Adonis, and airline executives had not forced the CAA into a hasty re-writing of long-standing guidelines on flying through volcanic ash. &quot;Lord Adonis has been fantastic because he is an intellectual and not an elected politician. He has understood the evidence, the data, and has been very supportive. He has never once put pressure us and likewise the airlines, who were anxious to get flying again but knew that we needed to have a safe method of working.&quot;  Asked if passengers should have any concerns about a new safety regime that permits planes to fly through low density ash clouds generated by Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, he added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Planes are now taking off and landing at UK airports under a new carve-up of European Union airspace that divides the continent into three zones: a no-fly area; a safe flight region; and areas where flying is permitted despite the presence of ash.  Following intense discussions with engine and aircraft makers, British airspace that was unsafe under the old regime 24 hours ago was redesignated as acceptable for passenger flights. Haines admitted that it took a &quot;burning platform&quot; to focus the industry on an issue - flying through volcanic ash - that had not been examined in great detail previously by an industry whose overriding safety obsession in recent years has been terrorism.  &quot;It depends on how much priority people give to these issues. Some ICAO [the global aviation safety body] working groups go on for five years. Who would have thought that volcanic ash would have been one of their priorities?&quot;        12.44pm: There was a time yesterday when the only flights you could get in the UK were to the Scottish islands, today they are the only place you can&apos;t fly to and from. Could a new flights ban over the Scotland islands being heading south? asks our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell:  The unpredictability of the Icelandic ash plume has just been underlined with the announcement that airspace over Orkney and Shetland has been shut down with immediate effect, leading to further delays and disruption for travellers and the oil industry. Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates nearly all regional and islands airports in the north and west of Scotland, has just released the following statement: &quot;Despite the widely publicised re-opening of UK airspace last night, National Air Traffic Services have issued directions in the last hour which indicate that the forecast concentrations of volcanic ash in the area around Orkney and Shetland are now expected to exceed safe operating limits between 13:00 and 19:00 today, Wednesday 21 April.&quot; So 15 flights linking Edinburgh and Aberdeen with Shetland and Orkneyscheduled for today have been abruptly cancelled.  Loganair, the main islands operator, is now offering passengers free tickets forrebookings. This closure raises the possibility of the flights ban being reimposed further south.   12.36pm: Airline acitivity across Europe, as tracked by flightradar24.com, is looking a lot busier than it has done over the last few days.      Screengrab from flightsradar24.com     12.06pm: More on the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; fiasco. The Foreign Office has just put out this statement:   &quot;Airlines have confirmed that due to flight restrictions being lifted from 2200 on 20 April, they will not now be diverting planes to a Madrid &quot;hub&quot;, but where possible flying direct to UK destinations. If you were planning to fly to the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; for onward transfer to the UK, you should now contact your airline for the latest advice about available direct flights. British Embassy staff are currently on the ground at the airport, helping passengers to find the best way back to the UK. The team&apos;s immediate priority is working with airlines and tour operators to get people on the first available flights to the UK. The Embassy team will be reinforced by more staff later today. Due to the earlier contingency planning, we have provision in place to allow us access to up to 150 coaches in and around Madrid. We are urgently assessing with the travel industry and our consular teams on the ground in Madrid how best to use this capability to assist British Nationals.&quot;   12.02pm: The airline industry is calling for a financial bailout and it appears to be trying to wriggle out of its compensation obligations to passengers.  &quot;This crisis is an act of god \u2013 completely beyond the control of airlines. Insurers certainly see it this way. But Europe&apos;s passenger rights regulations take no consideration of this. These regulations provide no relief for extraordinary situations and still hold airlines responsible to pay for hotels, meals and telephones,&quot; said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association.       11.43am: Michael Ellis, from Tettenhall in the West Midlands is stuck in Thailand, furious with the airline EVA, and looking for help. He emails:  My partner and I are stranded in Thailand. Today we were due to fly on the 11.50am EVA flight BR67. It was cancelled, but we were never called to try and standby for a later flight. In fact EVA have been nothing but unhelpful and their London team incredibly rude. We haven&apos;t yet been contacted concerning our return flight nor can we getthrough to reservations. We are now in Bangkok whilst political tensions increase in the city. Today we got caught up in a rally in Siam. We&apos;ve decided to move to Koh Chang, only an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, tobe safe and sound. EVA aren&apos;t helping with costs, but thankfully my insurance company are. We&apos;ve been told by other travellers that the soonest availability for a flight home is early May! I have already missed a flight on Friday to my best friend&apos;s wedding in Las Vegas, where I was supposed to be giving her away. Gutted and disappointed doesn&apos;t even cut it. I&apos;m stranded and need to get home. Please help?   11.31am: Five days of quiet skies has inspired some nice poetry and prose. Rural campaigners think we should be allowed to enjoy a world without planes every year. The experience of the last week has prompted the Campaign to Protect Rural England to call for a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; . Graeme Willis, senior rural policy campaigner, explains:   &quot;This disaster has revealed to many what they&apos;ve been missing: overnight the skies were stripped of the sight and sound of aeroplanes, and without the rumble and drone of aircraft people are reporting they can hear the simple sounds of the countryside once more. &quot;Perhaps the time is right to consider a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; to remind us all -for one day at least - of what we are all losing in our rush to be somewhere else. A planned approach to making all of our lives a little quieter and more tranquil could deliver some of the benefits of the last few days without the difficulties endured by so many people.&quot;   11.25am: &quot;Heathrow is starting to look like Heathrow again,&quot; according to Sam Jones at the airport with lots of hopeful passengers hoping to leave the UK.  11.16am: Guardian Daily presenter Jon Dennis was supposed to fly back from Barcelona on Friday. The ash cloud forced him and his young family to stay in a &quot;Swindon-by-Sea&quot; while they wondered how they&apos;d get back (as we heard on Monday 11.07am). Luckily they have just checked in for a return flight home. Jon describes his relief and the sense of solidarity among stranded Brits in Spain.  10.38am: The departure board at Heathrow still shows a rash of cancellations, according to the airline website Flightstats.      Screengrab from flightstats.co.uk          10.25am: Meanwhile, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano is still erupting, but is now producing less ash but more toxic gas, according to our science correspondent, Ian Sample. He writes:  The volcano is stable but remains active this morning, says Iceland&apos;s Civil Protection and Emergency Management Centre. The amount of ash being produced has fallen steadily over the past few days, but the plume is becoming more toxic due to higher levels of fluorine. The quantity of ash in the plume has dropped because the crater has become isolated from surrounding glacier ice. Most of the ash is produced when hot magma wells up and meets this ice and water.    10.19am: EasyJet says it plans to operate 900 flights (86% of its network) today. But it warns &quot;it will take several days to resume normal operations&quot;.      Adam Gabbatt     10.16am:  &quot;I&apos;ve just spoken with a press officer at BA. She said their longhaul flights are running as per BA&apos;s normal timetable this morning. So far both flights scheduled to take off \u2013 destined for New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 have done so. There could be some delays, she said, but all services should run. Short haul services will not run until 1pm today, however.  &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cabin crew and aircraft out of position,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to reposition the crews and the aircraft before resuming flights. Customers are still advised to check BA&apos;s website before flying, as there could be time changes and delays.&quot; She did say, however, that all short-haul services should be running after that time. In terms of BA flights in to the UK: again, short-haul services will only be operating from 1pm owing to repositioning, and services could be delayed. Long-haul flights will not be running normally inbound \u2013 because of diversions there will be delays \u2013 but should return to a normal service tomorrow. The latest information on flights will be posted on BA&apos;s website.&quot;  10.15am: Adam posts this Twitter exchange: @lefran @adamgabbatt I&apos;m stuck in Japan for another 9 days, no news on hotel or food budget or anything....impossible to get hold of call centers! @adamgabbatt @lefran ouch. Where are you staying for the next 9 days? @lefran @adamgabbatt my parents have had to snd me funds to check into a hostel. I now have little money left for food. Insrnce won&apos;t help me either       10.05am: Scores of Ryanair flights are still cancelled for tomorrow, including Helen Pidd&apos;s return from Berlin. Before heading for the railway station she emailed this:   My rearranged flight back from Berlin has been cancelled once again. I have thrown in the towel after five days waiting and I&apos;m going to get the train. Our environment colleagues will be glad to hear.        9.59am: What about those all those coaches in Madrid? Giles Tremlett, our correspondent in the city emails this:  I don&apos;t know what will happen to the &quot;Madrid hub&quot; idea for getting people stuck on other continents home via a long-distance coach service from Madrid airport. My guess is that, if it is not wound down, it will be used to try to help those stuck in Madrid and Spain already. There are plenty of them around. Online booking shops show flights available for today at \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,100 a shot but I am not sure I trust them. The first Iberia flight to London with free seats (\u20ac839) is, according to the company&apos;s own website, on Saturday. The first easyJet to London is on the 28 April. Yesterday the embassy desks at Terminal 1 and 4 were taking down mobile phone numbers of those stranded so that they could be called up when, and if, coaches became available. The first five coaches left last night with the ambassador, Giles Paxman, telling me this was &quot;just the start&quot; and that further resources would arrive today.       Adam Gabbatt     9.51am: &quot;Here&apos;s a breakdown of the financial impact of the volcano on various airlines. This is what some of the main carriers were losing at the peak of the disruption:  BA: \u00a315m-20m per day Easyjet: \u00a35m per day AirFrance/KLM: \u00a330.5m per day Emirates: \u00a36.5m per day Qantas: \u00a3900,000 per day TUI Travel (Owns Thompson and First Choice): \u00a36m per day Ryanair: \u00a35.2m European airports were losing around \u00a335m each day during the worst of the crisis. BAA, which owns Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton, was losing \u00a35m-6m each day.&quot;  9.42am: It&apos;s remarkable that flights have resumed so quickly, says our transport correspondent, Dan Milmo. Aviation restrictions usually take years to draw up. &quot;Given that the solution we have found is flying through clouds of ash, I think the government was understandbly a little bit weary of pushing Nats and the CAA into letting aircraft take off again after a blanket ban was put in place,&quot; he says.  9.18am: The crisis has cost the airline industry $1.7bn, making it worse than 9/11 in economic terms, according to the International Air Transport Association. It is also calling for restrictions on night flights to be lifted to help airlines return to normality.  Announcing the estimate IATA&apos;s director general Giovanni Bisignani said: &quot;At the worst, the crisis impacted 29% of global aviation and affected 1.2 million passengers a day. The scale of the crisis eclipsed 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days.&quot; &quot;As we are counting the costs of the crisis, we must also look for ways to mitigate the impact. Some of our airport partners are setting industry best practice. London Heathrow and Dubai are waiving parking fees and not charging for repositioning flights. Others airports must follow,&quot; said Bisignani.  8.56am:       Maev Kennedy&apos;s teenage son Samuel has made it back it from a school trip to China.  The 40 year-10- and 11 geography students from Orleans Park, and four teachers, who have been stranded in five star luxury in China, arrived back into Heathrow at 3.32am, to cheers from the parents and a furtive dab of teary eyes from their school head, Jo Longhurst.  Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona. Samuel - who described the flight, &quot;I had dinner, and then I had another dinner, and then I think I had another dinner&quot; - is fast asleep in his own bed.  Jo Longhurst is wide awake, wrestling with the nightmare scheduling for her 1,000 pupil comprehensive - high spirited respondents to yesterday&apos;s news blog please note, not posh private - school: she still has 12 teachers astray in the world, including the head of maths who is in Tibet, and who was warned yesterday she may not be able to fly back until May 6.   8.45am: In Thailand there&apos;s been a massive scramble to get on the first flights back to the UK. Ben Doherty, our man in Bangkok, writes:   I&apos;ve just got back from Bangkok Airport where the first London-bound plane has left. It was EVA Air flight. There absolute chaos trying to get onto it, authorities basically rang everybody who had had a flightcancelled (with EVA) in the last six days and said get to the airport.  We have a flight leaving today. Everyone rushed madly and it was first-in, first-served. Some people, who had only been delayed a day got on, while others who were on the original plane turned back last Thursday, are still stuck in Bangkok. I talked to a young couple whose plane was the last one cancelled into London. They missed the cut-off by a couple of hours. They are now at the back of the queue waiting to get home.  If you are having trouble getting home please get in touch or leave a comment below. You can email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or reach me on Twitter at @matthew_weaver  8.40am:The LibDems have also attacked the Tories for trying to politicise the travel chaos. Norman Baker, the party&apos;s transport spokesman, said: &quot;It&apos;s pretty reprehensible for the Conservatives to be almost gleeful about the chaos that there has been. The government is responsible for many things in this country but a volcano going off in Iceland is not one of them.&quot;  8.19am: The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, insisted that safety regulators have acted in an &quot;appropriate and and proper way throughout&quot;.  Speaking to the BBC&apos;s Today programme he denied that the government had put pressure on safety officials to change the rules. &quot;I believe that they [safety officials] have done their duty properly, and I would not have wished to place any pressure on them to have acted faster, than was compatible with the safe passage of planes,&quot; Lord Adonis said. On the delay in lifting the ban, he said it was right to wait for the results of observational data and the views of aircraft manufacturers. He said hew &quot;irritated&quot; by Conservative criticism of the government&apos;s handling of the crisis, and accused the Tories of &quot;playing party politics&quot; over the issue.  8am: Airlines have started the huge logistical operation of trying to return their flights schedule to normal after six days of restrictions were suddenly lifted last night. The first passengers arriving at Heathrow have described their relief at returning to the UK, but stranded passengers and those with bookings have been warned that the phased resumption of flights could takes days and even weeks.  There are lots of questions to answer and issues to be resolved including:\u2022 Were the volcanic ash restricitions necessary?\u2022 Is it safe to resume flights? \u2022 Did the airline bosses bully the officials into lifting the ban?\u2022 How long will it take to get stranded passengers home? \u2022 What happened to all those passengers who were told to head for Calais? \u2022 With planes out of position and restriction still in place, how long will it take for air traffic to return to normality?\u2022 How damaging has the crisising been to the airline industry?\u2022 Did the government do enough to help stranded passengers? \u2022 And how will we remember the days of quiet skies? As the recriminations begin the advice to passengers is to check with their airlines about flights.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T07:10:36Z", "title": "Iceland volcano - UK flights resume", "sentences": ["So far both flights scheduled to take off \u2013 destined for New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 have done so."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/apr/21/iceland-volcano-uk-flights-resume"}, {"tags": ["Air transport", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "UK news", "World news", "Airline industry", "Business", "Volcanoes"], "article": "     Airlines and UK airports are today scrambling to get flights back on schedule on the seventh day of the Iceland volcano crisis, amid claims that the government responded too cautiously to the ash cloud threat. Gordon Brown said the government would &quot;never be forgiven if we had let planes fly and there was a real danger to passengers&apos; lives&quot;, and the air safety watchdog told the Guardian that it was &quot;100% untrue&quot; to suggest it had been leant on either by ministers or by airlines. Brown suggested night flying rules would be relaxed to help get people home. &quot;We were making contingency arrangements to get people though the Channel and to get people from Spain,&quot; he said. &quot;But now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you will find that our airports are open longer to make that possible.&quot; The prime minister added: &quot;The first thing people will want to be sure of is, if you fly in an aeroplane, that you know it is going to be safe, and that was the first responsibility of the government.&quot; David Cameron said: &quot;It is clear that there has been some muddle and confusion in government about some of the information people have been given that doesn&apos;t seem to quite stack up. I think a rapid inquiry to get to the bottom of decisions that have been taken, the information that was received and given, and whether those decisions were right, would be a very good thing.&quot; The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Norman Baker, said: &quot;There are certainly questions to be asked, and I think the (Commons) transport select committee after the election will have a full inquiry into this \u2026 However, I do think it&apos;s important to remember that the government has had to listen to professional advice on this.&quot; The new flight regime effectively allows for three zones of international air space: ash-free, places where the ash concentration is regarded as safe, and places where it is unsafe. This solution had been under discussion across Europe since Monday afternoon. Previously, aircraft were not allowed to fly where there was ash. Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said transport secretary Lord Adonis &quot;has understood the evidence, the data, and has been very supportive. He has never once put pressure on us and likewise the airlines, who were anxious to get flying again but knew that we needed to have a safe method of working&quot;. Asked if passengers should have any concerns about a new safety regime that permits planes to fly through low-density ash clouds generated by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, Haines added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Flights began leaving Heathrow soon after 8am \u2013 among them an Alitalia flight to Rome and BA flights to New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 following the first arrival at the airport last night. Airports warned passengers they still faced major disruption as airlines tried to make sure their planes and crews were in the right places. Recriminations also continued over the government&apos;s repatriation programme via the Channel ports and Spain, under which Madrid was named as a &quot;hub&quot; airport for getting travellers from destinations outside Europe back home. The Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant, speaking in the Spanish capital, defended the rescue operation. &quot;It has been an unprecedented situation. We are trying to get it sorted, but don&apos;t underestimate the fact that this is phenomenally complicated and difficult.&quot; British Airways was operating long-haul flights from Heathrow and Gatwick today, and this afternoon short-haul flights were also leaving. Inbound long-haul flights also faced delays owing to diversions but should return to normal tomorrow. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cabin crew and aircraft out of position,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;We need to reposition the crews and the aircraft before resuming flights. Customers are still advised to check BA&apos;s website before flying as there could be time changes and delays.&quot; EasyJet hoped to run 900 flights today (86% of its network), with 140,000 passengers, while Ryanair said there would be no flights until after 5am tomorrow. That meant many flights were cancelled at Stansted, which normally operates around 450 flights a day. Overground rail lines serving London&apos;s airports will stay open all night tonight to help get stranded air passengers home, Network Rail announced today. The London main line stations of Victoria, Paddington and Liverpool Street, as well as Gatwick Airport station, will be open as well. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimated that airlines globally had lost $1.7bn (\u00a31.1bn). BA has lost up to \u00a320m daily, TUI (representing Thomson and First Choice) \u00a36m, easyJet \u00a35m, Ryanair \u00a35.2m, Air France/KLM \u00a330.5m, Emirates \u00a36.5m and Qantas \u00a3900,000. Iata is likely to face stiff opposition over an appeal to the EU to address &quot;unfair&quot; regulations which still hold airlines responsible for paying passengers&apos; hotels, meals and telephone bills even in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;. Ryanair boss Michael O&apos;Leary said flights between Ireland and the UK would remain cancelled until 5am on Friday, 24 hours later than its other services since most passengers travelling between Ireland and the UK could switch to coach and ferry alternatives. The company would also suspend airport check-in and baggage fees so that handling agents could &quot;prioritise getting flights out on time and processing standby passenger lists&quot;. But holiday firms TUI and Thomas Cook complained of a &quot;two-tier system&quot; in the way the government was handling the crisis for low cost airlines and airlines of holiday companies. &quot;Some low cost airlines stated that their focus would be to commence normal flying schedules as soon as possible and made it clear that it was the government&apos;s responsibility to repatriate their customers. We believe this is a flawed and inequitable approach that is to the disadvantage of consumers,&quot; they said in a statement. Peter Long, chief executive, of TUI, said: &quot;The government&apos;s response to the crisis has been a shambles. It is clear they underestimated the severity of the consequences of the decision for a blanket closure of the airspace for such a protracted period of time. This has been compounded by the fact that they have neither put in place a viable repatriation plan or ensured that the industry behaves in a consistent and responsible manner.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T13:54:00Z", "title": "UK airports face continued disruption as volcano flight ban ends", "sentences": ["All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Flights began leaving Heathrow soon after 8am \u2013 among them an Alitalia flight to Rome and BA flights to New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 following the first arrival at the airport last night."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/21/uk-airports-disruption-volcano-flight-ban-ends"}, {"tags": ["Gil Scott-Heron", "Pop and rock", "Rap", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Gil Scott-Heron is a law unto himself.

The city is going through an unprecedented real estate explosion: its skyline is constantly rising, property prices increased by 37% last year, and new projects are snatched before they&apos;re even publicised. If Tel Avivians were afraid of Iranian nukes and missiles, like their prime minister, they would not spend millions of dollars on luxury apartments built near the Israeli Defence Forces headquarters. Or they simply don&apos;t believe Netanyahu. With more than 3 million people in its metropolitan area, Tel Aviv is the bastion of Israel&apos;s secular liberalism, a combination of Wall Street, SoHo and Ibiza. While voting for the left, most Tel Avivians care little about the Palestinians or about the wider Middle East. The internet allows Israelis to feel plugged into the west, leapfrogging their immediate neighbourhood. And since many Tel Avivians have lived and studied abroad, travel frequently, or dream of moving elsewhere, they can get around more easily in London or Manhattan than in the more traditional parts of Israel. They would seldom visit Jerusalem, Israel&apos;s capital located 50 minutes away, viewing it as too religious, overburdened with history and politics, and generally boring. Foreigners are often shocked by Tel Aviv&apos;s careless, hedonistic feel, so distant from the tough, conservative, and violent image of Israel abroad. But with all its western aspiration, Tel Aviv is distinctly Israeli, with its warm and humid weather and informal social code. Here, like elsewhere in the country, people hate standing in lines, customer service sucks, and soldiers on leave walk around with their shoulder-strapped M-16s. And even the most secular Israelis are closely tied with their families and have more kids than their European or North American peers. The attitude has always been here. The city&apos;s visionary, Akiva Aryeh Weiss, imagined &quot;the New York of Palestine&quot; over a century ago, when the place was a sand dune in a remote corner of the Ottoman empire. Shai Agnon, Israel&apos;s national writer and Nobel laureate, who witnessed the founding of &quot;the first Hebrew city,&quot; depicted in his masterpiece novel Only Yesterday the chasm between the free love and literary life of Tel Aviv, and the strict religious observance of ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem. Although published before the establishment of Israel, its theme is still relevant today. As the religious parts of Israel&apos;s society grew stronger in numbers and political influence, Tel Aviv reacted by becoming even more secular and free of religion and tradition. You can barely find a decent kosher restaurant here, while in Jerusalem, the non-kosher food joints are dying out for lack of customers. And even a rightwing politician such as education minister Gideon Saar, a proud Likud member who lives around the corner from me, DJs occasionally in the neighbourhood pub, promotes gay and lesbian rights, and opposes the expulsion of second-generation illegal immigrants \u2013 a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of Tel Aviv liberals. Social and political critics of the Tel Aviv lifestyle argue that it&apos;s a &quot;bubble&quot; oblivious to the threats facing Israel. Tel Aviv was hit repeatedly by Palestinian suicide bombers, but the party went on. When war raged elsewhere, Tel Avivians enjoyed their good life, as if the fighting occurs on another planet. During the second Lebanon war, in the summer of 2006, Tel Aviv beach clubs were full as hundreds of thousands of Israelis fled their rocket-ridden homes in the north. After the war, the chief of military personnel argued that &quot;there is no bereavement in Tel Aviv&quot; \u2013 or, in other words, that the city&apos;s youngsters avoid the combat units. Rightwingers blame Tel Avivians for abandoning the Zionist cause, aspiring to get rich and travel abroad \u2013 through careers in high-tech or the arts \u2013 rather than serving in the front lines or joining the civil service, like their parents&apos; generation. Netanyahu spoke recently of the &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; attitude of the young generation, and warned against detachment from Jewish and Zionist heritage, which he seeks to revive. Less refined critics describe Tel Avivians as sex-crazed, materialistic animals who shun the flag and the anthem. We are not deterred, however. We&apos;re as good Israelis as our critics. Our forefathers came here to escape the chains of tradition and build a &quot;normal&quot; secular society on the Mediterranean shore. Tel Aviv is the proud outcome of their vision and efforts, and it will remain the thriving centre of all things Israeli. The current real estate boom is just the most recent example of the city&apos;s vitality. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-04-28T11:03:17Z", "title": "Tel Aviv liberals are true Israelis too | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["There is one place where Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s warnings of an Iranian-initiated &quot;second Holocaust&quot; fail to reverberate, and that is Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s business, culture and fun hub.", "If Tel Avivians were afraid of Iranian nukes and missiles, like their prime minister, they would not spend millions of dollars on luxury apartments built near the Israeli Defence Forces headquarters.", "With more than 3 million people in its metropolitan area, Tel Aviv is the bastion of Israel&apos;s secular liberalism, a combination of Wall Street, SoHo and Ibiza.", "While voting for the left, most Tel Avivians care little about the Palestinians or about the wider Middle East.", "And since many Tel Avivians have lived and studied abroad, travel frequently, or dream of moving elsewhere, they can get around more easily in London or Manhattan than in the more traditional parts of Israel.", "Foreigners are often shocked by Tel Aviv&apos;s careless, hedonistic feel, so distant from the tough, conservative, and violent image of Israel abroad.", "But with all its western aspiration, Tel Aviv is distinctly Israeli, with its warm and humid weather and informal social code.", "Shai Agnon, Israel&apos;s national writer and Nobel laureate, who witnessed the founding of &quot;the first Hebrew city,&quot; depicted in his masterpiece novel Only Yesterday the chasm between the free love and literary life of Tel Aviv, and the strict religious observance of ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem.", "As the religious parts of Israel&apos;s society grew stronger in numbers and political influence, Tel Aviv reacted by becoming even more secular and free of religion and tradition.", "And even a rightwing politician such as education minister Gideon Saar, a proud Likud member who lives around the corner from me, DJs occasionally in the neighbourhood pub, promotes gay and lesbian rights, and opposes the expulsion of second-generation illegal immigrants \u2013 a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of Tel Aviv liberals.", "Social and political critics of the Tel Aviv lifestyle argue that it&apos;s a &quot;bubble&quot; oblivious to the threats facing Israel.", "Tel Aviv was hit repeatedly by Palestinian suicide bombers, but the party went on.", "When war raged elsewhere, Tel Avivians enjoyed their good life, as if the fighting occurs on another planet.", "During the second Lebanon war, in the summer of 2006, Tel Aviv beach clubs were full as hundreds of thousands of Israelis fled their rocket-ridden homes in the north.", "After the war, the chief of military personnel argued that &quot;there is no bereavement in Tel Aviv&quot; \u2013 or, in other words, that the city&apos;s youngsters avoid the combat units.", "Rightwingers blame Tel Avivians for abandoning the Zionist cause, aspiring to get rich and travel abroad \u2013 through careers in high-tech or the arts \u2013 rather than serving in the front lines or joining the civil service, like their parents&apos; generation.", "Less refined critics describe Tel Avivians as sex-crazed, materialistic animals who shun the flag and the anthem.", "Tel Aviv is the proud outcome of their vision and efforts, and it will remain the thriving centre of all things Israeli."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/28/tel-aviv-israelis-hedonistic-bubble"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Human rights", "War crimes", "Freedom of speech", "World news", "Law"], "article": "Israeli human rights groups say they are deeply concerned about a newly proposed bill that could shut down any organisation that investigates and mounts legal challenges to abuses by the military. The bill was introduced in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, yesterday with the support of at least 17 MPs from different parties. If it became law it would prevent any organisation from being registered, or would close down existing groups if they were found to be passing information &quot;to foreign entities&quot; or were &quot;involved in legal proceedings abroad against senior Israeli government officials or IDF officers for war crimes&quot;. Rights groups said the bill, an amendment to the law of associations, was the latest in a series of efforts to curb their activity in the wake of Israel&apos;s war in Gaza. Several groups produced evidence suggesting the Israeli Defence Forces had committed serious violations of international law during the three-week war and gave evidence to the UN inquiry led by the South African judge Richard Goldstone. Goldstone&apos;s report said both Israel and Hamas were suspected of war crimes and should hold their own independent investigations. The report met with intense criticism from Israeli officials, and the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has listed the &quot;Goldstone effect&quot; as one of the three most serious security challenges facing Israel today. In a joint statement today, 10 Israeli human rights groups said the bill would &quot;trample&quot; democratic values. &quot;Instead of defending democracy, the sponsors of this bill prefer to reduce it to ashes,&quot; they said. &quot;This bill is the direct result of irresponsible leadership that is doing all it can to undermine democratic values and the institutions that are the backbone of a democracy: the supreme court, a free press and human rights organisations.&quot; The groups included B&apos;Tselem, Gisha, Adalah, the Association of Civil Rights in Israel and Rabbis for Human Rights. Adalah, which works on Arab minority rights within Israel, said the bill was &quot;a dangerous step&quot; against human rights groups. The bill &quot;seeks to restrict the freedom of expression and freedom of association of these organisations&quot;, it said. However, the bill already has significant cross-party support. &quot;The bill will put an end to the rampage by NPOs [non-profit organisations] who are trying to subvert the state under the guise of human rights,&quot; Ronit Tirosh, an MP from the centrist opposition Kadima party, told the Ma&apos;ariv newspaper. It also appears to have support among the Israeli public. An opinion poll for the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper this week found 58% of Jewish Israelis believed human rights groups that exposed immoral conduct by Israel should not be allowed to operate freely. Slightly more than half said there was &quot;too much freedom of expression&quot; in Israel, according to the survey by the Tami Steinmetz Centre for Peace Research, at Tel Aviv University. Most said they supported punishing Israelis who backed sanctions or boycotts against Israel, and supported punishing journalists who reported news critical of the Israeli defence establishment.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-29T14:38:53Z", "title": "Rights groups attack Israeli bill to shut down military critics", "sentences": ["Slightly more than half said there was &quot;too much freedom of expression&quot; in Israel, according to the survey by the Tami Steinmetz Centre for Peace Research, at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/rights-groups-israeli-bill-military"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Iran", "Israel", "Syria", "Hillary Clinton", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Iran has pledged to &quot;cut off Israel&apos;s feet&quot; if it attacks Syria, fuelling tensions over one of the Middle East&apos;s most combustible flashpoints after the US publicly warned Damascus not to risk starting a war. Mohammad Rida Rahimi, the Iranian vice-president, made the statement today at the end of a visit to Syria that was billed as underlining the strategic relationship between the two countries. &quot;We will stand alongside Syria against any [Israeli] threat,&quot; Rahimi said at a news conference with the Syrian prime minister, Mohammad Naji Otri. &quot;If those who have violated Palestinian land try anything, we will cut off their feet,&quot; he promised. The sabre-rattling followed a spate of US statements accusing Damascus and Tehran of arming the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah with sophisticated weapons that could threaten Israel. On Thursday, the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton publicly warned President Bashar al-Assad of the risk of sparking a regional war if he is found to be supplying long-range Scud missiles to Hezbollah. Syria and Lebanon have both denied any shipments and accused Israel of raising tensions. &quot;Israel will pay a dear price if it attacks Lebanon,&quot; Lebanese president Michel Suleiman said. &quot;Israel is eager to find reasons to destroy Lebanon.&quot; Israeli military sources have hinted that Israel refrained from attacking arms convoys it detected entering Lebanon, preferring to use the information to pressure the US into taking action against Syria. Clinton told the American Jewish Committee: &quot;President Assad is making decisions that could mean war or peace for the region. We know he&apos;s hearing from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. It is crucial that he also hear directly from us so that the potential consequences of his actions are clear.&quot; Clinton said a nuclear-armed Iran would destabilise the region. Hezbollah fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 during which it fired more than 4,000 rockets. Israel estimates that it has since stockpiled more than 40,000 rockets, some of which could reach big cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv.

It was no surprise that five of the seven disbanded &quot;supporters&apos; associations&quot; were of PSG fans (the other two were from Lyon and Nice), since the most ferocious confrontations in recent years have been between PSG fans and ... other PSG fans. The catalyst for the commission&apos;s decision were the gory events that preceded February&apos;s PSG-Marseille match, when rival PSG fans engaged in clashes that left a 37-year-old man, Yann Lorence, dead. But the problem has been festering for years. Through weakness and wrong-headed policies, PSG has allowed its ground to become a theatre in which the social and racial tensions that afflict its city&apos;s suburbs are enflamed. PSG took the wrong path almost from its outset. Founded in 1970 amid dreams of grandeur, the club did not immediately attract mass support. In 1978, in a bid to foster popular fervour, the club owners dubbed one end of the stadium the &apos;Boulogne Kop&apos; and offered cut-price tickets. Fans duly flocked in, but among them were many Neo-Nazis, whose presence put off many other would-be supporters, especially non-whites. Rather than root out the racists, the club tried, in the early 1990s, to attract members of ethnic minorities to the opposite end of the ground, the Auteuil stand. &quot;That was a mistake,&quot; an unnamed former club director was quoted as admitting in France Football. &quot;It amounted to tacit acceptance that the Boulogne was a white-only stand.&quot; Not only was it dangerous for non-whites to venture into the Boulogne end, it also became a no-go area for law enforcers, as three riot policeman found in 1993 when they chased a pitch invader back into the stand and got battered. As the violence and racism escalated, the club again chose appeasement, attempting to co-opt the extremists in the Boulogne end by employing some of the heads of their supporters&apos; associations as stewards. That infuriated fans at the Auteuil end, who interpreted the move as just another endorsement of racism by the French establishment. The rivalry between the two ends of the Parc offers a caricature of the debate on immigration: while the Auteuil associations insist they are affirming their right to participate in public life on equal terms, the Boulogne extremists view them as unwelcome immigrants intent on usurping their club just as they want to take their women and jobs and so on. Symptomatic of this is the fact that one of the milestones on the descent into disorder was in 2003 when one of the Auteuil fan groups, the now defunct Tigris Mystic, held aloft a banner declaring &quot;The Future Belongs to Us&quot; \u2013 many in the Boulogne insist that was a declaration of war. Since then the clashes have been more frequent and more brutal, and have not been confined to Paris: rumbles break out on away trips too. In 2006, for example, loons from Tigris Mystic and the Boulogne ran into each other on the way to Nantes, and the ensuing hostilities left several people seriously injured and a motorway service station in flames. Francis Graille, who was president of PSG from 2003 to 2005, claimed in France Football last month that when he announced his intention to clamp down on the supporters&apos; associations he received death threats and, ultimately, lost the backing of his bosses, who replaced him. &quot;The guy who died the other week [Lorence], he was killed by everyone,&quot; said Graille. Though a PSG fan was shot dead by police in 2006 after fighting following a Uefa Cup defeat by Hapoel Tel Aviv, Lorence&apos;s death was the first time that a PSG fan has been killed by a supporter of the same club. The club reacted with uncharacteristic firmness, immediately banning all its fans from travelling to away games. A host of other measures have been introduced and there is much talk of ID cards or following &quot;the English model&quot; by improving surveillance and policing and hiking ticket prices. The dissolutions, however, may not achieve much other than deprive the supporters of official status \u2013 they can still go to matches and stand where they have always stood. &quot;It is political window dressing,&quot; one official, who asked not to be named, told the Observer. &quot;The government just wants to be seen to be doing something.&quot; Even so, the dissolutions drew predictably hostile reaction from the fans, many of whom demonstrated against the decision before yesterday&apos;s French Cup final between PSG and Monaco. &quot;This is another reflection of the pervasive racism and violence that has surrounded PSG for the last 30 years,&quot; fumed Christophe Uldry, spokesman for the Supras Auteuil group, who disseminated a video to the media that purportedly proved they were merely defending themselves from attacks by Boulogne hooligans on the night Lorence was killed. &quot;The clubs would be better served keeping the supporters&apos; association so that they have an official relay with the fans, otherwise the stadiums will fall prey to informal gangs,&quot; warned Uldry. Others are also opposed to dissolution \u2013 because it is not radical enough. &quot;To put an end to the violence that almost systematically mars PSG matches now, it is not enough to dissolve such and such supporters&apos; association,&quot; declared L&apos;Express journalist Christopher Barbier. &quot;PSG itself must be dissolved. An example must be set for the whole country \u2013 the club must be quashed.&quot; Rumours are running wild. The latest one is that, whether PSG is quashed or not, a new club is going to be created in Paris to cater for all the football fans who are turned off by the violence. And the mastermind supposedly behind this new club? None other than the disgraced former president of PSG&apos;s arch-rivals, Marseille, the convicted match-fixer Bernard Tapie.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-01T23:08:47Z", "title": "French government gets tough on football hooligans", "sentences": ["Though a PSG fan was shot dead by police in 2006 after fighting following a Uefa Cup defeat by Hapoel Tel Aviv, Lorence&apos;s death was the first time that a PSG fan has been killed by a supporter of the same club."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/02/french-government-tough-football-hooligans"}, {"tags": ["Lebanon", "Film", "World news", "Israel", "Lebanon", "Culture"], "article": "Samuel Maoz was 20 years old when he killed a man for the first time. It was 1982 and Israel had recently begun fighting a war against the PLO and Syria in Lebanon, a campaign which, although supposed to last for just three weeks, would continue, in various guises, for 18 bloody and horrifying years. Maoz, an Israeli soldier by dint of the fact that he was still doing his national service when the war began, was a member of the tank corps. Specifically, he was a gunner. At 6.15am on 6 June, in the stony hills of southern Lebanon, he looked down the sight of the gun of his rackety, ageing tank. In the crosshairs was a small truck. It was speeding down a dirt track towards him, its middle-aged Arab driver shouting and gesticulating wildly. Maoz did not know if this man was the enemy. How could he? &quot;This war was different to others that Israel had fought,&quot; he says. &quot;In the Six Day War, there were two armies, in two different uniforms, fighting over one strip of land. I&apos;m not saying that was less horrible, but it was at least clear. In Lebanon, the war was fought in neighbourhoods, there were 10 kinds of enemies, and many of them were wearing jeans. It was\u2026 chaotic.&quot; He looked at the man. Was he driving at him, or was he driving away from someone, or something? No matter. In his ear, Maoz heard his orders, loud and clear. He fired. His life changed forever. Maoz was in Lebanon for 45 days. Thirty of them (&quot;thirty days of hell,&quot; he says) he spent in his tank, with only three other men \u2013 the commander, the driver and the loader \u2013 for company. The remaining 15 he spent in Beirut, in a hotel suite, in the care of Israel&apos;s Christian Phalangist allies. &quot;You couldn&apos;t leave the tank,&quot; he says. &quot;But this is the thing: you didn&apos;t want to. You hate the tank, but you love it, too. To be inside it is hell. But it will save you. A tank can survive even a rocket attack.&quot; He smiles. &quot;I remember we used to talk about injuries. Our dream was to have a light injury: a bullet in the leg, something like that. We&apos;d seen soldiers with those kinds of injuries. They were smiling \u2013 victory smiles! \u2013 and smoking and waiting to be taken home. But we knew that wouldn&apos;t happen to us. Either we would live, and keep fighting, or there would be nothing left of us to bury.&quot; When he got home, Maoz was considered lucky. He had his arms and his legs, his face was not scarred, his skin had not been burned. His mother flung her arms around him, wept, and gave thanks to God for his safe return. What she failed to realise, however, was that a part of Maoz had died in Lebanon. &quot;She was embracing an empty shell,&quot; he says. &quot;I could not escape the fact that I had pulled the trigger, that I was a kind of executioner, that I was the last person in the death link.&quot; After the second Lebanon war, in 2006, whole sections of Israeli hospitals were given over to helping soldiers deal with the psychological fallout. But in 1982, things were different. &quot;Those who couldn&apos;t fight for, say, medical reasons used to sneak home by the back door; they didn&apos;t want anyone to see that they didn&apos;t have a gun, that they were only a clerk. As for the rest of us, well, to complain afterwards that you felt bad inside was unforgivable. The older generation told us, &apos;Say thank you that you are alive; we were in the [Nazi concentration] camps.&apos; We hated them because they used the camps against us and this made us feel we had no right to complain.&quot; He winces. &quot;Even now, as I&apos;m talking about it, I feel like a bad boy. &quot;For the next 25 years, Maoz said nothing. The son of a bus driver and a nurse, he had always wanted to be a film-maker (at 13, for his barmitzvah, he received an 8mm camera and four minutes&apos; worth of film) and, in 1988, shortly after finishing a cinematography course at the Beit Zvi Academy of the Arts, he did try, briefly, to write a film script about his experiences. &quot;But the first memory that came was the smell of burning flesh.&quot; He backed away, fearing his trauma would only increase. Then, in 2006, Israel again invaded Lebanon. Suddenly, after years of inertia and darkness, everything changed. &quot;I was sitting in front of the television \u2013 I&apos;m sure you can understand that it was the best reality show going for them \u2013 and I realised that this was no longer about me and my needs, my problems, my memories, my pain. Our boys were dealing with the same thing all over again. I suppose you could say it was a mission. I wanted to make a film that might save a life. I took a life; now I could save a life. It&apos;s no coincidence that there have been three Israeli films about the Lebanon war in as many years [the others are the Oscar-nominated Beaufort and the Golden Globe-winning Waltz With Bashir]. When the pain is only affecting you, you can ignore it. When it&apos;s affecting your children, this is a red light.&quot; Maoz does not believe in good wars and bad wars. &quot;War is not the last solution. War is no solution at all. War is a beast which, once released, cannot be controlled. The second Lebanon war was a totally bad idea.&quot; So he began writing: a spare script &quot;because when you are scared, you do not speak&quot;. This was the work of mere weeks. &quot;It was like I had had an electric shock; I had been woken from a long hibernation.&quot; Euphoric, he then set about shooting his film. The result, Lebanon, made on a budget so small there were times when its actors had to do duty with the clapperboard, won the Golden Lion, the top prize, at last year&apos;s Venice film festival, where it received a 20-minute standing ovation (Maoz was so overcome, he wept). It was also featured at festivals in Toronto, New York, Pusan and London, where Maoz was awarded the 14th Satyajit Ray award. In Israel, it won four Ophir awards. As a consequence, Maoz now seems to be almost permanently on the move, though he isn&apos;t complaining. &quot;I feel very lucky and, more important, I feel hungry again, full of passion.&quot; Did he have any idea his film would be so acclaimed? &quot;Well, I worked hard. I really worked hard for three years. But, with all due respect, when I was making the film, I thought only about my small country. I would rather change the mind of one mother than impress 100 intellectual journalists.&quot; Lebanon has been likened to Das Boot, Wolfgang Petersen&apos;s 1981 film about life on a Second World War U-boat. It&apos;s easy to see why. It&apos;s not only that, in Lebanon, all the action takes place in a similarly enclosed space (the only time the audience catches sight of the world outside the tank is through the sight of its gun). Like Petersen, who said that he wanted to take the audience &quot;on a journey to the edge of the mind&quot;, Maoz isn&apos;t interested in plot or character so much as the effect such an extreme situation has on a human being \u2013 any human being. &quot;There is a huge difference between serving in an army and in a war,&quot; says Maoz. &quot;They can&apos;t prepare you. They can make sure you&apos;re in good shape. They can make sure that you know how to use a gun. But they can&apos;t prepare you emotionally and, in the end, they don&apos;t need to. This is the trick of war. It needs death in order to exist. &quot;Normal people can&apos;t kill. You need to be a psycho. So the trick of war is to take a human being and put him in this\u2026 situation. After that, it&apos;s a process. It takes 24 hours, maybe 48. It&apos;s a metamorphosis. Our most basic instinct, our survival instinct, starts to take control and it&apos;s like a drug: you can&apos;t resist it. The first step is that you almost lose your sense of taste, because you need to be able to eat everything without saying, &apos;I like it, I don&apos;t like it.&apos; Then you start to hear and see very sharply. Then you find that you need only half an hour of sleep. You don&apos;t think about moral calls and this is the trick of war. You&apos;re not fighting for your country or for your family. You&apos;re fighting for your life. &quot;And this is why, when people around me start talking about war and morals, it&apos;s ridiculous to me. I&apos;ll give you an example. In Lebanon, every time we found ourselves entering a small town, they told us that on 50% of its balconies there were snipers with missiles and on the other 50% there were families. Now, if you&apos;re going to check balcony after balcony, you won&apos;t survive beyond three or four. So what are your options? I mean your options to be moral? Am I a pacifist? Am I not? It doesn&apos;t work like that. It&apos;s like blinking and, yes, these acts afterwards fuck your life.&quot; In Lebanon, we see only what the tank&apos;s four occupants see, hear only what they hear, know only what they know. It is claustrophic and visceral and audiences regularly tell Maoz that, watching it, they felt as if they, too, were in the tank. &quot;I wanted the audience to smell the smells, taste the tastes,&quot; says Maoz. &quot;I wanted you to see the victims of war staring straight into your eyes [via the sight of the tank&apos;s gun]. In a way, the tank is the fifth character. It&apos;s like an animal. The men are in the stomach of a wild animal.&quot; This is exactly right. In the gloom, unidentifiable liquids seep from mysterious pipes and gather on the tank&apos;s floor in foul, viscous pools. Meanwhile, as the turret swings laboriously from this direction to that, it makes a sound so raw and agonised, it could drive a man insane. This, too, is deliberate. &quot;When we created that noise, we tried to mix the sound of a hydraulic mechanism with the sound of a wounded animal.&quot; (Point of information: the inside of the tank is not, in fact, a tank; it is the chassis of an old tractor, which two stage hands would violently shake up and down as and when Maoz required. But he needed a tank for the film&apos;s opening and closing sequences, a prize item he and his designer eventually found abandoned by the side of a road in northern Israel, presumably the result of some bureaucratic cock-up. &quot;Someone, somewhere, forgot to sign for it.&quot;) The absence of dialogue in his script meant that rehearsing Lebanon seemed pointless. But, in any case, Maoz had a better plan. &quot;I took each of the actors and, separately, locked them in a very small, dark and hot container. After about two hours, when I knew their bodies would have shut down, as if hypnotised, I knocked on the iron walls with a bar, something that sounded very like an attack on a tank. For the next two hours, they were waiting for the next time. So this was a new state: nervousness. They spent five or six hours like this and when they came out and I looked in their eyes, I could see that I didn&apos;t have to explain anything else.&quot; Torturer! &quot;Yes. But this is how we worked.&quot; Most of what happens in the film happened to him, he says, though sometimes the real life version was, if anything, worse. Take the film&apos;s turning point, when the tank in which Maoz&apos;s alter ego Shmulik (Yoav Donat) is gunner gets lost deep in Beirut. &quot;In life, it was more extreme. After a while [during the war] people in Israel started asking questions. They wanted to know what on earth was going on. So someone [in the army, or the government, or both] had the bright idea: let&apos;s take three tanks and sneak them in the night into Beirut. We will spread a rumour, all the journalists will come, they will see that the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] is in Beirut and that will buy us time until we really are there. I was in one of those tanks. The Phalangists led us. Mine was totally drunk, I could smell the whisky. I asked him, &apos;Do you know where you are going?&apos; He said, &apos;No, but Jesus is with me.&apos; Anyway, he led us straight to a place where there were 11 Syrian tanks. I don&apos;t know if he sold us out, or if it was a mistake, but we found ourselves surrounded. We started to shoot, but all our systems crashed. &quot;When the Syrians realised this, they climbed on the tank. They wanted to kill us with their knives. Then we heard the voice of an F-15 pilot on the emergency channel. He told us he was on his way. We told him, &apos;You can&apos;t bomb here, you will kill us.&apos; &apos;Don&apos;t worry,&apos; he said. &apos;I have eight seconds to think of something.&apos; In the end, he dived so low the Syrians ran off. We pushed the gas and drove.&quot; This is a startling story, but perhaps the most startling thing about it is that the man in Air Force Intelligence who scrambled the plane was Lebanon&apos;s director of photography, Giora Bejach. &quot;We were scouting for locations and we were talking, comparing our experiences in Lebanon. He described a lost tank, the shit it was in and how he had dispatched a fighter to the site. That was me, I said, and I quoted back to him the exact words I&apos;d said over the radio during that long minute.&quot; For Maoz, making his film turned out to be, cliched though this sounds, healing. As he wrote the script, he realised he was at last able to put some distance between himself and his past. This time, he didn&apos;t smell burning flesh. Physically, too, something changed. &quot;Two days into the shoot, I developed an infection in my leg. It was so painful I could hardly walk. The doctor gave me antibiotics and I went to bed for a day. When I woke up, the pain was gone.&quot; He looked down at his foot and, there beside it on the mattress, were five small pieces of shrapnel, rejected by his body after nearly three decades, evidence, he believes, of &quot;the connection between body and soul&quot;. And now? Does he feel better now? &quot;It&apos;s not a question of feeling better. It&apos;s not that I now feel clean, clear and fresh. It is still the first thought in the morning and the last at night. But I never expected it not to be. This is the price and we will pay it. But I do feel more complete. I accept myself. I can learn to live with it.&quot; Lebanon is part of a blossoming Israeli cinema, the result, Maoz believes, of the Israel Film Foundation&apos;s new proactivity when it comes to finding European partners and European money. Tiny Israel now turns out some 15 movies every year, most of which seek to challenge the status quo. Some, like Lebanon and Beaufort, look at Israel&apos;s conflicts with its neighbours. Others, like Close to Home (2005), which investigates the tedium as well as the tension of the daily routines of two women conscripts in Jerusalem, and Lemon Tree (2008), which charts the legal efforts of a Palestinian widow to stop an Israeli defence minister, her next-door neighbour, from destroying her family lemon grove, have more domestic canvases. A few, such as Eyes Wide Open, which also opens in the UK this month, seek to challenge religious taboos (it&apos;s a gay love story set in the Orthodox community). None of this, however, means that their release is any the less controversial, or not in some quarters. In some ways, reaction to Lebanon has been wholly predictable. &quot;In Israel, the younger the audience, the more positive the response,&quot; says Maoz. &quot;The older generation has been more negative. I suppose I understand it. As I said, many of them came from the camps. I remember my teacher, her camp number on her arm, shouting in the class that we must fight for our country, even die for it, because everyone wants to terminate us. But when we were growing up, the only things in our heads were the Tel Aviv beach and girls. When our parents had their wars, they felt it was the only choice and they won. When we had our wars\u2026 well, it&apos;s no longer the only choice and, even with the best army, we lost.&quot; In Europe, the response has been more baffling. Prizes aside, anti-Israel feeling among audiences is high and it seems to have blinded some both to Lebanon&apos;s obvious artistic virtues and to its righteous intentions. &quot;The fact that I put the focus on the soldiers, not the victims, upset them. In Norway, people started to shout at me. &apos;Don&apos;t talk to us until your soldiers leave Gaza!&apos; they said, as if I were a representative of the government. That was too much for me! No one likes the situation in Gaza, but still\u2026 missiles are fired at Israeli cities from Gaza. Sometimes, I don&apos;t know if these people really want peace. They have all these opinions, but they don&apos;t really know anything\u2026 they just want to feel intelligent and left wing and artistic.&quot; He looks wan, momentarily exhausted. What about him? Does he feel peace will come? &quot;I feel it will, but for capitalist reasons rather than humanist ones. People are definitely tired, their motivation for war is low, but money also plays a part, like when it was revealed that every Israeli citizen paid the equivalent of 170% on their electricity bill to fund Gaza.&quot; He grins. &quot;We don&apos;t have to be good friends. We just have to be at peace. Like the British and the French. You hate each other, but you are at peace.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-05-01T23:09:37Z", "title": "Samuel Maoz: my life at war and my hopes for peace", "sentences": ["But when we were growing up, the only things in our heads were the Tel Aviv beach and girls."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/02/israel-lebanon-samuel-maoz-tanks"}, {"tags": ["Paris Saint-Germain", "Ligue 1", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "PSG &apos;must be dissolved&apos;  The French government&apos;s latest attempt to eradicate football hooliganism has caused quite a stir. &quot;This is a measure that is unprecedented in French sport!&quot; screams Le Parisien after the national commission for the prevention of football violence &quot;dissolved&quot; seven fan groups accused of fomenting much of the fighting that has become endemic in and around some Ligue 1 grounds, most notably the Parc des Princes, home of Paris Saint-Germain. Five of the seven disbanded groups were of PSG fans (the other two were from Lyon and Nice). The most ferocious confrontations in recent years have been between PSG fans and ... other PSG fans. The commission&apos;s decision was driven by the events that preceded February&apos;s PSG-Marseille match, when rival PSG fans engaged in clashes that left a 37-year-old man dead. PSG took the wrong path almost from the outset. Founded in 1970 amid dreams of grandeur, the club did not immediately attract mass support. In 1978, in a bid to foster popular fervour, the owners dubbed one end of the stadium the &quot;Boulogne Kop&quot; and offered cut-price tickets. Fans flocked in, but among them were many neo-Nazis, whose presence put off many other would-be supporters, especially non-whites. Rather than root out the racists, the club tried, in the early 1990s, to attract members of ethnic minorities to the opposite end of the ground, the Auteuil stand. &quot;That was a mistake,&quot; an unnamed former club director tells France Football. &quot;It amounted to tacit acceptance that the Boulogne was a whites-only stand.&quot; The rivalry between the two ends of the Parc offers a caricature of the debate on immigration: while the Auteuil associations insist they are affirming their right to participate in public life on equal terms, the Boulogne extremists view them as unwelcome immigrants who want their women, their jobs, and now their football club. Clashes have become more frequent and more brutal. Though a PSG fan was shot dead by police in 2006 after fighting following a Uefa Cup defeat by Hapoel Tel Aviv, Yann Lorence&apos;s death was the first time a PSG fan has been killed by a supporter of the club. The disbanding of the fans&apos; groups drew predictably hostile reaction from the supporters themselves, many of whom protested before yesterday&apos;s French Cup final between PSG and Monaco. Others believe the dissolution is not radical enough. &quot;It is not enough to dissolve such and such supporters&apos; association,&quot; declares L&apos;Express journalist Christopher Barbier. &quot;PSG itself must be dissolved. An example must be set for the whole country.&quot; Rumours are running wild. The latest one is that a new club will be created in Paris to cater for all the football fans who are turned off by the violence. And the mastermind supposedly behind this new club is none other than the disgraced former president of PSG&apos;s arch-rivals, Marseille, the convicted match\u2011fixer Bernard Tapie. Virtual racing puts new talent behind the wheel A 21-year-old Frenchman lived out the fantasies of teenage boys entranced with speed last week, reports top-selling motorsport magazine Auto Hebdo, as Jordan Tresson won a real-life spot in a motor racing team by playing a driving game on his PlayStation. The process began last year when he and 1.2 million others from 17 countries entered the GT Academy time trial by playing a special version of the Gran Turismo game. The fastest from each country went on to compete at a five-day final in real cars at Silverstone before being whittled down to two by judges including ex-F1 driver Johnny Herbert and former team boss Eddie Jordan. Tresson then faced off against Italian Luca Lorenzini on a busy Silverstone circuit on Wednesday, put in some quick laps and secured the place. &quot;I never imagined I would end up here when I was on my PlayStation&quot; he told the magazine, having earned a season\u2011long drive in a Nissan 370Z for the RJN Motorsport team as part of the European GT Cup series. &quot;At the moment I just feel like my body is here but my mind is not. This has always been my dream.&quot; As unlikely a route to a career in racing as this may be, it&apos;s happened before, when Hungarian driver Norbert Michelisz was picked up by the Zengo-Dension team after they spotted his name at the top of online racing game leaderboards and gave him a test run. He was successful and races in the World Touring Car Championship at Marrakech today, while Tresson makes his competitive debut at Silverstone this afternoon.  UNITED STATESYou can&apos;t get quicker than\u00a0a Cap quick fixer   There may be awkward times ahead for ice hockey as Sports Illustrated publishes an investigation into the NHL&apos;s drug\u2011testing policy, suggesting it is far from rigorous. The bulk of the accusations focus on claims that a former body builder was supplying steroids to players, specifically mentioning members of the Washington Capitals. The story was picked up and run extensively in both the US and Canada, prompting further questions about why the league does not test out of season or during the play-offs. It could not have come at a worse time for Caps fans, who watched their side make history by becoming the first No1-seeded team in play-off history to drop a series lead of 3-1 to the eighth (and lowest) seeded side, losing 4-3 to the Montreal Canadiens. All round a tough week for Caps players then, which made their final moment in the spotlight this week really touch a nerve with fans. The Washington Post reports how Mary Ann Wangemann and her 14-year-old daughter Lorraine were travelling back from the defeat, only to blow a tyre. Already shell-shocked at their team&apos;s loss, they were vulnerable and &quot;spooked&quot; at the side of the road when Caps centre (and scorer of their only goal in that final game) Brooks Laich pulled up and proceeded to change the tyre. &quot;He was like an angel,&quot; said Mary Ann, who chatted with the player about why the team all seemed so nice. &quot;We&apos;re just people, too,&quot; Laich replied, before completing the job. Mary Ann said she didn&apos;t know how she could thank him, reports the Post: &quot;&apos;I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do something nice for someone in the future,&apos;&quot; Laich responded. He then hugged them and drove off.

Goods thought to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds were snatched after a 10-strong gang wearing balaclavas used a sledgehammer to break down a fire door at the west London mall and then broke into branches of De Beers and Tiffany &amp; Co early today morning The attacks are the latest in a series of raids in the capital with goods worth more than \u00a34m taken. Watches of Switzerland, Cartier, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Tiffany &amp; Co, Mozafarian and Tateossian stores have all been hit. Across England, the last month has seen armed robberies at two jewellery shops in Bradford, West Yorkshire, one in Dudley, West Midlands, where a shot was fired, and smash-and-grab thefts at high-street retailers in Tilehurst, Berkshire, and Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In the Westfield raid, the first at Europe&apos;s largest urban mall since it opened in October 2008, the gang escaped in three stolen vehicles. Incidents of jewellery raids have been rising since 2007, with gangs of thieves often riding stolen mopeds and carrying heavy tools to smash shop fronts. In London, Metropolitan police figures show Westminster, Islington and Camden among the worst hit, with figures for these areas showing smash-and-grab robberies, including on jewellers, rising from 108 in 2006 to 165 in 2008. Robert Read, art and jewellery expert at the insurer Hiscox, said the rise was linked to the recession, and the current very high price of gold, which made the break-up value of stolen items &quot;pretty decent&quot;. &quot;Gold and platinum can be melted. Big stones can be recut,&quot; he said. High-end jewellery was likely to be exported to the main diamond cutting centres of Antwerp, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, and cities in China, where stones could be cut and cleaned of identifying marks by &quot;a dodgy diamantaire&quot; then re-imported to Britain as &quot;kosher&quot; stones, he said. Smaller items could be laundered through the many shops springing up in the UK&apos;s high streets offering to buy gold jewellery. &quot;If you&apos;re a smash-and-grab raider on the high street and you&apos;re taking a small amount, it could be easily done without anyone picking up on it. If you&apos;re offered a gold pendant, what are you going to do?&quot; he said. Raids on jewellers &quot;run in cycles&quot;, he said. &quot;What happens is you get a spate of them, then you get copycats if it proves to be successful. Coupled with the recession you tend to see a rise. &quot;Then jewellers start beefing up their security, put tougher glass in the windows, bollards in front of shops to prevent ram-raiding, and criminals move on to softer targets. &quot;Then, about seven or eight years later as the jewellers get more comfortable with their security they again become an easier target. So, it&apos;s a continuous battle.&quot; &quot;At the moment, jewellers are in vogue again&quot;. He said recent high-profile raids should force upmarket shops to rethink their strategy: &quot;I don&apos;t think they will be able to continue to display those whopping, very attractive stones in their showcases. I think they will all have to be sold privately from some secure premises, and showrooms will just have to carry lower values. Because there is too much of a temptation at the moment.&quot; &quot;So we will see lower value in the showroom, and the bigger items being sold privately from secure non-high street locations. Because if you have controlled entry and exit, and you are on the first floor, it&apos;s a much trickier proposition. &quot;The trouble is for a jeweller, you want to put your baubles on show because that attracts the customers. They have to get this balance between being conservative, and how dramatically they show their goods.&quot; For the lower-end retailer, with much smaller stock, the cost of enhanced security was not always economically viable, he said. Staff at the Westfield shops were yesterday compiling an inventory of what had been taken. A police spokesman said the gang escaped in three stolen cars, one of which was followed by police for a short distance before officers lost sight of it. No one was injured during the raid. Fran\u00e7ois Delage, chief executive of De Beers, said: &quot;This is an unfortunate incident, but is yet another reminder of the timeless allure of diamonds.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-05-05T18:35:08Z", "title": "Westfield jewellers hit by smash-and-grab raiders", "sentences": ["High-end jewellery was likely to be exported to the main diamond cutting centres of Antwerp, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, and cities in China, where stones could be cut and cleaned of identifying marks by &quot;a dodgy diamantaire&quot; then re-imported to Britain as &quot;kosher&quot; stones, he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/05/westfield-smash-grab-raiders-jewellers"}, {"tags": ["Drama", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "On the one hand, you have a claustrophobic, clapped-out Israeli army tank stuck on enemy soil; on the other, a suffocating, dead-end Arab ghetto that bleeds racial tension. Two locations, two new Israeli films. Both have won multiple awards, both have been praised as the brave new face of Israeli cinema \u2013 yet each is built on entirely different foundations, seemingly symbolising the struggle for the soul of the country. The tank film is Lebanon, the winner of the Golden Lion at last year&apos;s Venice film festival, and the work of Samuel Maoz, who was an Israeli soldier during the 1982 Lebanon war. The army sent Maoz into combat as a tank gunner, an experience that left him emotionally crippled, in shock but unable to articulate why. Twenty-five years later, he exorcised the demons by turning the nightmare into celluloid, portraying the horror of a soldier pawn, stuck in a brain-grindingly noisy tank \u2013 and stuck in an absurd conflict with no power to determine his own path. The ghetto film is Ajami, which gives the soul-searching a wide berth in a dry-eyed portrayal of the neighbourhood in Jaffa \u2013 the Arab city glued to the tail-end of Tel Aviv \u2013 from which it takes its name. This Oscar-nominated film doesn&apos;t rely on a single, subjective view; it tells its story through multiple narratives. Among the half-dozen perspectives we&apos;re shown are those of Omar, a young Palestine resident of Ajami, whose life is horribly compromised by a family feud; Dando, an Israeli policemen who is shattered by the recent disappearance of his soldier brother; and Binj, an Arab who tries to avoid the casual violence, police harassment and seemingly inevitable racial hatred of his surroundings with his Jewish girlfriend in Tel Aviv. Maoz&apos;s film, lauded for its cinematic artistry as well as its anti-war message, is all about mood. Lebanon is highly visual \u2013 although for the most part we see only the four young members of the tank crew, sardines in a war tin-can, and the view through the crosshairs of the tank&apos;s gun barrel. And these Israeli soldiers are the opposite of primed, gun-happy fighters: they are scared, inexperienced; their commander spends most of the film in hysterics; the gunner can&apos;t bring himself to shoot. You can practically smell the metal tang of fear as the soldiers are cooped up together, lost in enemy territory and terrified beyond a point their brains can comprehend. Lebanon is a physically unpleasant film, a feat in itself \u2013 audiences report that they feel as though they are actually sitting in the bowels of the tank with the four soldiers. While Lebanon has garnered international praise, it has also drawn plenty of criticism: chiefly because of its exclusive focus on the trauma of Israeli soldiers, not their victims. It jars that an Israeli tank, a grisly killing machine, is throughout depicted in essence as a source of terror for the soldiers inside it, rather than the people its shells are aimed at. Moreover, the people committing the worst violence \u2013 using each other as human shields, threatening with hideous acts of torture \u2013 are the Lebanese themselves. The key point is that the film tank&apos;s remit is to sweep areas that have already been blasted by Israeli aircraft, so the soldiers stuck inside it are exposed to the aftermath, rather than being the main perpetrators of attack. Hence Lebanon is a continuation of the &quot;shooting-and-crying&quot; tradition of Israeli cinema. This narrative style \u2013 shoot first, wring hands later \u2013 started a few years after the first Palestinian intifada of 1987 with Eran Riklis&apos;s Cup Final, and is still evidenced in recent films such as Waltz With Bashir and Beaufort, both also set in wars with Lebanon and focused on Israeli soldiers&apos; trauma. One scene in Maoz&apos;s film actually has an Israeli soldier shedding tears at the sight of the civilian victims of war, as seen through the gunsights of his tank gun. Maoz says that Israel&apos;s 2006 war in Lebanon was a wake-up call to him to do something with his terrible experiences of 1982, to try to stop the current generation of Israeli soldiers going through another futile war. &quot;I wrote Lebanon straight from\u00a0my gut,&quot; he says. &quot;I wrote what I felt. I wanted to talk about emotional wounds, to tell the story of a slaughtered soul, a\u00a0story that was not to be found in the body of the plot, but derived from deep within it.&quot; But Meir Schnitzer, film critic for the Israeli newspaper Maariv, is scornful of what he describes as the &quot;classic leftwing Zionist&quot; ethos anchoring this movie and perpetuating war myths. &quot;It is like Oliver Stone making a Vietnam movie today, where he tries to show that the US went to war to protect Saigon from communism.&quot; Lebanon is an anti-war film of the Hurt\u00a0Locker variety \u2013 an attempt to show\u00a0the profound horrors of combat, but\u00a0one that clings to the operational premise that your own army is essentially moral and humane, a force for democracy. &quot;I can&apos;t complain, because the director has said that he wanted to tell his own story,&quot; says Schnitzer. &quot;He found his own personal redemption \u2013 but it is a real problem that\u00a0this story does not explain the wider\u00a0politics.&quot; Ajami, on the other hand, is told non-chronologically, the scrambled timeframe serving to challenge our assumptions of why its characters behave as they do. This story does not shy from the complex, compromised realities for Arabs in the neglected shadows of Israel. It is there in the way the Arab characters call police &quot;the authorities&quot;, and never call them when help is needed. It is there in the reason why they don&apos;t call them: because when Israeli police show up for Arabs in this film, their attitude is, without fail, heavy-handed, rude and premised on a working principle that the Arabs must be guilty of something. It is there in the impoverished set of options available to the young characters of Ajami. And it is there in the trivial but telling altercation between a group of Arabs and their new, yuppie Jewish neighbour; ostensibly about a noisy sheep, but steeped in the latent anger leaking out of the oppressive power structures that dictate Arab-Jewish relations in Israel. &quot;Film should be about political issues, about a social consciousness \u2013 not just entertainment,&quot; says Yaron Shani, the Jewish Israeli film-maker who co-directed Ajami with Scandar Copti, a Palestinian who grew up in Ajami and appears as one\u00a0of the film&apos;s characters. The two directors cast non-actor residents of Jaffa, putting an ensemble of around 150 people through a year of role-playing and improvisation training, so that they could act the film unscripted. &quot;They became so identified with the characters they played,&quot; says Shani. &quot;When we put them in scene situations, their reactions were real. We didn&apos;t tell them what to do, or what was going to happen, we just let them live the situation as the character would in real life.&quot; There was a script, but the cast didn&apos;t see it \u2013 they just behaved exactly as the script predicted, in their own words. The resulting film was an Israeli box-office hit, won an Ophir (Israel&apos;s main film award) and got a special mention at Cannes. &quot;We created a huge photocopy machine, copied reality and brought it to the cinema,&quot; says Copti. &quot;The fact that we have Palestinian protagonists who aren&apos;t stereotyped or patronised, and that Jews can relate to the protagonists, that&apos;s a huge thing for me.&quot; Some commentators saw reasons for optimism in the fact that the Israel Film Academy submitted Ajami, a predominantly Arabic-language film, as its Oscar contender. (It won a nomination, but was beaten to the award by the The Secret in Their Eyes from Argentina.) But others have scorned such establishment approval as a stock &quot;figleaf&quot; tactic \u2013 using the film&apos;s existence to showcase Israeli tolerance and diversity. If it is a figleaf, Copti isn&apos;t playing along. On the eve of the Oscar announcements, he said he did not represent Israel just because it funded the film. &quot;I cannot represent a country that does not represent me,&quot; he told Israeli army radio \u2013 to predictable accusations of ingratitude from Israeli ministers. He has also scuppered claims that Israel is a socially equal, racially tolerant country. &quot;I like to call it segregated,&quot; he says, referring to Jaffa, often described as a harmonious &quot;mixed-Arab-Jewish city&quot;. &quot;Mixed is only in the hummus we eat. A few people do hang out together, but when the slightest thing goes wrong \u2013 it is segregated. We are Arabs, Palestinians, but a sense of belonging does not exist for us.&quot; Lebanon is released next Friday; Ajami is released on 18 June", "publicationDate": "2010-05-06T21:30:02Z", "title": "Ajami and Lebanon: two filmic faces of Israel", "sentences": ["The ghetto film is Ajami, which gives the soul-searching a wide berth in a dry-eyed portrayal of the neighbourhood in Jaffa \u2013 the Arab city glued to the tail-end of Tel Aviv \u2013 from which it takes its name.", "Among the half-dozen perspectives we&apos;re shown are those of Omar, a young Palestine resident of Ajami, whose life is horribly compromised by a family feud; Dando, an Israeli policemen who is shattered by the recent disappearance of his soldier brother; and Binj, an Arab who tries to avoid the casual violence, police harassment and seemingly inevitable racial hatred of his surroundings with his Jewish girlfriend in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/06/ajami-lebanon-israel-filmmaking"}, {"tags": ["Slovenia", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup 2010 Group C", "World Cup"], "article": "The Slovenia coach, Matjaz Kek, has named his 30-man provisional squad for the World Cup finals.

Plunged soon afterwards into the armed struggle for the Jewish state, Arikha was severely injured and left for dead in 1948, but within a year he had won a scholarship to study art in Paris. There he became a significant avant-garde figure, before turning from abstract to figurative painting in the mid-1960s, partly as a result of seeing an exhibition of Caravaggio at the Louvre. As he told the Washington Post in 1979: &quot;People who think there is anything new in the arts are idiots. In my early 30s I was quite successful as an abstractionist. But I started painting my own set of forms over and over again. Finally, it repulsed me.&quot; Arikha was born into a German Jewish family in Radauti, northern Romania. His father perished in the march to a Ukrainian concentration camp in 1941, and it was not until after the war that his mother discovered that Arikha and his sister were alive in Palestine. From 1944, Arikha was a member of the Ma&apos;ale Hachamisha kibbutz in the Judaean hills, and, in 1946, he began to attend the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem. Bezalel must have seemed more progressive to Arikha than his next college, the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he learned traditional techniques such as fresco painting. This experience did not, however, dampen Arikha&apos;s ardour for the avant garde, and he eventually took up the still-fashionable cause of abstract art, although with a distinctive sense of colour and handling of paint. In 1954 Arikha decided to settle in Paris, his home for the rest of his life, partly at the instigation of his friend the dramatist Samuel Beckett, whom he first met backstage in a theatre. Their relationship, recently celebrated in How It Was (2001), a memoir by Arikha&apos;s wife, the US poet Anne Atik, led Beckett to produce a book about Arikha, who in turn illustrated many of the writer&apos;s texts. Arikha&apos;s dramatic abandonment of abstraction in 1965 was accompanied by a switch from painting to graphic art, which preoccupied him for the next eight years. During this period he developed his mastery of etching and other print media, while his drawings allowed him to achieve a remarkable directness, always working from life and finishing the image in a single sitting. By 1973 he felt able to paint with the same spontaneity, never using preparatory studies and yet creating pictures that are precise and lucid, partly thanks to his practice of always using daylight. Although figurative, these works still show the influence of abstract painting in their rigorous compositions and limited pictorial space. Arikha&apos;s deft combination of classicism and modernity proved highly popular with the right sort of clientele. He had great success in various genres, including the nude, landscape and still-life, but it was with his portraiture that he made the greatest impact. With subjects ranging from the Queen Mother to Catherine Deneuve, Arikha enjoyed a wealth of public commissions in the last 30 years of his life. His portrait of Lord Home of the Hirsel was particularly apposite, with the former prime minister&apos;s elongated figure strategically placed at the edge of the canvas \u2013 the epitome of aristocratic diffidence. This painting is in the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland, and Arikha&apos;s work appears in numerous other institutions, including the British Museum, to which he bequeathed 100 prints and drawings. His most important shows were large one-man displays at the Israel Museum, in Jerusalem, and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, which placed equal emphasis on his paintings and graphic art, and, most recently, a retrospective at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. Arikha&apos;s bright tones and crisp lines inevitably invite comparison with classical and academic painting, in which he developed a strong historical interest. Unusually for an artist, he was a talented scholar and author, contributing to exhibitions of Ingres and Poussin in the US, as well as writing the book Peinture et Regard (1991) and articles for American magazines such as The New Republic. Although he turned his back on the avant garde at a relatively early age, Arikha remained an enigmatic and even disturbing figure, whose work has a nervous, edgy quality, memorably described by the critic Robert Hughes as an &quot;air of scrupulous anxiety&quot;. Arikha was an artist who could create a sense of discomfort even when clasped to the bosom of the establishment. In 2005 he was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d&apos;Honneur. He is survived by Anne, his daughters Alba and Noga, and two grandchildren. \u2022 Avigdor Arikha, artist, born 28 April 1929; died 29 April 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-05-11T18:08:54Z", "title": "Avigdor Arikha obituary", "sentences": ["His most important shows were large one-man displays at the Israel Museum, in Jerusalem, and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, which placed equal emphasis on his paintings and graphic art, and, most recently, a retrospective at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/11/avigdor-arikha-obituary"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Human rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "If you didn&apos;t have peripheral vision, it would probably be fine. If you didn&apos;t glance to the sides of Israel&apos;s highway 443 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, then it wouldn&apos;t smack you in the face that the road is \u2013 how shall we put it? \u2013 segregated. As it is, you can&apos;t help but notice that when the 443 passes by the Israeli town of Modi&apos;in and heads east into the occupied West Bank, some of its side-routes are blocked. Concrete boulders, metal barriers, rubble and heaps of rubbish halt roads from Palestinian villages such as Beit Sira and Beit Ur al-Fuka. And if you stop at one of those barricades, a complicated coping apparatus comes to light: cars deposit weary Palestinians who work inside Israel at these blocked routes; on the other side, lines of parked Palestinian cabs await to resume the interrupted journey home. Palestinians without permits to work or travel inside Israel can&apos;t be on the 443 at all. So for the 3,000 inhabitants of Beit Sira, one of six villages affected by the blocked highway, a trip to nearby Ramallah, about 12 miles away, now takes hours via minor roads that are prohibitively long, pot-holed and sometimes flooded. Some 55,000 Palestinians are thought to be affected by the road ban. The Israeli military barred Palestinian access to this road in 2002, citing security reasons after several shootings in which five Israelis were killed. But last December, Israel&apos;s supreme court ruled that this sweeping ban on Palestinian movement was disproportionate and that the roadblocks had to be lifted. The court pointed out that the 443 \u2013 which cuts through the occupied West Bank for a 12-mile stretch \u2013 had only been approved during the 1980s on condition that it would be open to all. (A comic Hebrew animation explains this here.) The army has had five months to sort it out, but that time was mostly employed by ministers to scaremonger about how an open 443 would make sitting targets of Israeli drivers, who would instantly migrate to the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem route, highway 1 \u2013 and choke it. Now the military has unveiled its response to the court&apos;s decision: a sort of de-block-and-re-block manoeuvre. The idea is to partially open parts of the road but to compensate that with an extra checkpoint at one end, scrutinising those Palestinians newly permitted to drive this limited section. And so, once again, the Israeli military \u2013 the real authority in the West Bank \u2013 has shown that, unless absolutely compelled to do so, it cannot be trusted to do the right thing in the occupied territories. No matter that thousands of Palestinians who have nothing to do with any shooting or stone-throwing are denied easy access to the most basic facilities. No matter that sick patients don&apos;t make it to hospital on time; or that Palestinians have to rise at the crack of dawn, slip through the crevices of concrete barriers and creep slowly though an Israeli checkpoint \u2013 while Israeli-plated cars breeze past \u2013 just to get to work. And why bother getting to the bones of the issue by asking why those few Palestinians would have attacked Israeli cars whistling through the West Bank, on a road that has been dug out of occupied land, in the midst of the viciously crushed second intifada? No; far easier to completely bar Palestinian passage on this road. And when the Israeli court challenges that, just block the road in a different way and see if those pedantic judges shut up. But could the court be disinclined to shut up on this matter? The Israeli military claims that the court knew about the partial-opening plans. Meanwhile, some 1,000 Israeli families have petitioned the court to keep the road closed because they say the army&apos;s solution is too lax. And the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, which filed the original petition to open the road, immediately filed another in response to army&apos;s unblocked-but-closed policy. It looks as though highway 443 \u2013 so often cited as a symbol of segregationist policy \u2013 might not be properly open to Palestinians in the near future. But until it is, a drive on this road feels like a fast, scenic shortcut through another people&apos;s daily punishment. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T08:30:01Z", "title": "Israel's apartheid road | Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["If you didn&apos;t glance to the sides of Israel&apos;s highway 443 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, then it wouldn&apos;t smack you in the face that the road is \u2013 how shall we put it?", "The army has had five months to sort it out, but that time was mostly employed by ministers to scaremonger about how an open 443 would make sitting targets of Israeli drivers, who would instantly migrate to the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem route, highway 1 \u2013 and choke it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/17/israel-palestine-highway-443-segregation"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Brazil", "Turkey", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Nuclear weapons", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Europe", "Americas"], "article": "The dramatic news from Tehran that a last-minute breakthrough may have been reached to avert a global crisis over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme is a highly positive development for everybody \u2013 except those in Washington and Tel Aviv who have been looking for an excuse to isolate or attack Iran. It also marks the debut of a highly promising new force on the world stage: the Turkey-Brazil axis. Last week, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil took a classic good-cop bad-cop approach to Iranian leaders. Lula announced that he would fly to Tehran, which gave the Iranians clear hope for a deal. But the deal required both leaders, and Erdogan was cagey. On Thursday, Turkey&apos;s highly skilled foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said his boss would not travel to Iran unless the Iranians were ready to make a deal. &quot;The matter is not just to hold a three-way meeting,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to get results if such a meeting is to be held.&quot; On Friday, Erdogan escalated his brinksmanship by saying that his tentatively planned trip to Tehran was &quot;no longer possible for me, as Iran has not taken that step on the issue&quot;. A few hours later, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton telephoned Davutoglu and sought to discourage the Turkey-Brazil initiative. A state department spokesman said she had warned him that any summit in Tehran would be just a ploy, &quot;an attempt to stop security council action without actually taking steps to address international concerns about its nuclear programme&quot;. After the phone call, Clinton predicted publicly that the Turkish-Brazilian effort to broker a deal with Iran would fail. &quot;Every step of the way has demonstrated clearly to the world that Iran is not participating in the international arena in the way that we had asked them to do,&quot; she told reporters in Washington, &quot;and that they continued to pursue their nuclear programme.&quot; Clinton, however, may not have been on the same political page as the White House. As she was speaking in Washington, Turkish officials in Ankara were telling journalists at an off-the-record briefing that they had received quiet encouragement from President Barack Obama to press ahead with their mediating effort. This may have been a planned divergence of official American opinion designed to pressure Iran; just as possibly, it reflects Clinton&apos;s continuing isolation from the inner-circle of American foreign policymaking on crucial world issues. Some in Washington may view this deal as a way to give Iran a face-saving escape from its looming confrontation with the US and European Union. It may have been, but Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, saw it from the opposite perspective. He said last week that Iran was seeking a deal brokered by Brazil and Turkey &quot;to give western countries an opportunity to save face and find a way out of the current situation&quot;. Either way, skilful negotiating by two world leaders undermined the view, widely accepted in Washington, that Iran could only be made to compromise if it was threatened with sanctions and repeated warnings that the US would consider &quot;all options&quot; to block further progress in its nuclear programme. Turkey and Brazil, though half a world apart geographically, have much in common. Both are large countries that spent long years under military dominance, but have broken with that history and made decisive steps towards full democracy. Both are led by dynamic and ambitious leaders who have presided over remarkable economic booms. Both have already emerged as regional powers, but have grander ambitions to become world powers on the level of Russia, India and perhaps even China. Neither could fulfil those ambitions alone. Together, however, they form a partnership that holds tantalising possibilities. No two countries have opened more new embassies around the world in the last couple of years than Turkey and Brazil. Senior Turkish diplomats return to Ankara once a year for a grand strategic conference, and at this year&apos;s meeting, held in January, Brazil&apos;s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, was among the main speakers. Turkey and Brazil were once near-automatic supporters of Washington, but they have struck out on their own path. Distressed by what they saw as blundering American unilateralism that destabilised entire regions of the world, they have sought to defuse international confrontations and promote peaceful compromises instead. By felicitous coincidence, both are now nonpermanent members of the security council. This gave them special leverage over Iran. They have used it deftly. During the cold war, the non-aligned movement tried to become a &quot;third force&quot; in world politics, but failed because it was too large and unwieldy. Turkey and Brazil are now emerging as the global force for compromise and dialogue that the non-aligned movement never was.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T11:30:01Z", "title": "Iran's nuclear deal | Stephen Kinzer", "sentences": ["The dramatic news from Tehran that a last-minute breakthrough may have been reached to avert a global crisis over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme is a highly positive development for everybody \u2013 except those in Washington and Tel Aviv who have been looking for an excuse to isolate or attack Iran."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/17/iran-nuclear-brazil-turkey-deal"}, {"tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "A month-long conference in New York to shore up the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and prevent the global spread of atomic weapons is faced with possible collapse owing to wrangling over the goal of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. Senior western diplomats are warning that unless agreement can be reached over the next few days on a way forward for Middle East talks, the NPT review conference could grind to a halt without anything to show for it. Failure to achieve any positive outcome would be a serious blow to the credibility of the international community&apos;s efforts to deal with pressing nuclear problems, particularly in regards to Iran. At the centre of the crisis are highly sensitive ongoing negotiations on plans for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The idea is being championed by Egypt and the Arab nations as a way of forcing Israel to admit publicly that it is in possession of nuclear arms as a first step towards eradicating those weapons. Under a long-standing policy of ambiguity, Israel has never admitted possessing atomic weapons, though it is universally believed to do so. Israel is one of four countries that has refused to sign up to the NPT, and persuading Tel Aviv to attend any discussion on nuclear arms in the Middle East is proving difficult. So far there is no sign that the Israeli government is prepared to budge, as it says it will only sign the treaty once a full Arab-Israel peace deal is achieved. A senior western diplomat said that without Israel there could be no meeting on the nuclear-free zone, while Iran would also have to show up if the talks were to be credible given the current confrontation over Tehran&apos;s nuclear enrichment programme. Israel is under pressure from allies to conform on the issue, and talks are understood to be continuing with the US administration, which backs a nuclear-free zone. The diplomat added: &quot;Israel will attend if it thinks the cost of not attending will be higher than if it does.&quot; Parties close to the negotiations now fear that if the Middle East plan fails to get off the ground then the Arab nations will act as a bloc at the New York conference \u2013 forcing it to end in failure, which has serious consequences. &quot;Two major crashes of the NPT review conference in 10 years, what would that say about our ability to take forward multilateral diplomacy?&quot; a western diplomat said, referring to the collapse of the last conference in 2005. The concern is that another collapse would send the wrong signals to Iran at a time when the international community is trying to present an united front against Tehran over uranium enrichment. If Iran continues on a course of confrontation with nuclear regulators, it faces new sanctions after the UN security council&apos;s five permanent members plus Germany reach agreement last night. The draft resolution is largely based on the sanctions regime devised for North Korea and removes several loopholes that Tehran had exploited in previous resolutions. The security council wants to see Iran suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities which it suspects could be geared towards the making of nuclear bombs. Iran insists it is only interested in developing civilian nuclear power. Iran today dismissed the draft resolution, saying the measures were unlikely to be approved and would not break its economy if implemented. &quot;The draft being discussed at the United Nations security council has no legitimacy,&quot; Iran&apos;s semi-official Fars news agency quoted, Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi, a senior adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying. The draft resolution instructs UN member states, for instance, to repel any attempts by Iran to acquire assets in uranium mining in their countries, a clause believed to relate to some parts of Africa and Latin America where Tehran has shown recent interest. Member states are called upon to inspect any ships going to and from Iran suspected to be carrying prohibited materiel that could be used in the making or ballistic missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons.

He is on his way home to his village of Beit Sira, a journey that takes him one and half hours. &quot;I have to go round the globe in order to enter my village,&quot; he says with a wry smile. It wasn&apos;t always so. Route 443, the road he has just come off, has been barred to Palestinian traffic for the last eight years \u2013 a symbol of the separation between the two sides of this conflict. Before 2002 Palestinians used it freely to get between nearby towns and villages in the West Bank; since then they have been forced to use circuitous and poorly maintained back roads, often quadrupling their journey times. But from tomorrow the army will be forced to comply with an order from Israel&apos;s high court to reopen the road to Palestinian traffic following a case brought by the Association of Civil Rights in Israel (Acri). Nobody is happy. Israeli drivers fear their security will be compromised; Palestinians say the reopening of the road is a farce, rendered worthless by the construction of new checkpoints. &quot;The IDF [army] say they are opening the road, but they are also building new checkpoints on our land,&quot; says Bassam Kattab, 34, selling lemonade to workers passing through the concrete barrier. Nearby, separated by an earth bank and a two-metre high metal fence topped with razor wire, some of the 40,000 Israeli cars that use route 443 daily are hurtling towards Jerusalem. Army watchtowers punctuate the length of the road. Over the years a number of roads connecting Jewish settlements in the West Bank have been designated for exclusive Israeli use. The 443, however, is a strategic corridor between Israel&apos;s two main cities, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. More than half its 15-mile length cuts through the West Bank. Privately owned Palestinian land was expropriated to develop the road in the 1980s, a move allowed by the high court on the basis that it would serve both Israelis and Palestinians. For years, the road connected seven Palestinian villages along its route with each other and with the city of Ramallah, a hub for shopping, business and recreation. But following several attacks in 2001-2, in which six Israelis were killed, route 443 was closed to Palestinian drivers and access to their villages blocked. Journeys that had taken moments suddenly took hours. Villagers say it wasn&apos;t just an inconvenience: several have died while trying to reach hospitals on the back roads, they say. Then last December the court ruled in favour of the challenge brought by Acri. More than 1,000 Israeli families have petitioned against the move. &quot;They don&apos;t want to risk their lives by using this road alongside Palestinian drivers,&quot; says Nitsana Durshan-Leitner of Shurat HaDin, a law centre that represents them. Acri believes few Palestinians will use the road even if they are allowed to. Along the route four army checkpoints are being established at which Palestinian vehicles will be searched and their drivers&apos; papers examined. The aim, according to Acri, is to make it difficult if not impossible for the villagers to use the road while allowing the IDF to claim it has fulfilled the order of the high court. This cuts no ice with Durshan-Leitner. &quot;Even if it harms Palestinian lives by forcing them to spend more time on small roads, the rights of people using [the 443] are superior. The right to life is higher than the right to get somewhere five minutes earlier.&quot; Back at the concrete barrier near Beit Sira, Bassam Kattab has some questions. &quot;Why are the people of Tel Aviv allowed to move freely, and not me? Why are we the forgotten people?

But growing suspicion that the army operation to capture Christopher &quot;Dudus&quot; Coke and extradite him to the US turned into a bloodbath of extra-judicial killings is threatening to sweep away public support for the government&apos;s attempt to assert control over what has been called a &quot;state within a state&quot;. Jamaica&apos;s information minister, Daryl Vaz, said the war in Coke&apos;s stronghold over the past week \u2013 which has left almost 80 people dead \u2013 is only the beginning. &quot;The serving of that warrant [against Coke] is part of our bigger plan to tackle the gangs perpetrating these criminal acts throughout Jamaica,&quot; he said. &quot;This situation in Tivoli Gardens is a massive operation. There are other operations on a smaller level taking place throughout other communities, inner-city communities especially. It is an opportunity that we cannot let go in terms of dealing with the crime situation in a holistic fashion. The level of criminality and lawlessness in Jamaica has to be fought on all fronts.&quot; Many Jamaicans welcome the military&apos;s challenge to Coke and his notorious Shower Posse, a criminal organisation that extends to the US and Europe. They also want to see a final break in the links between the major parties and the gangs that once served the politicians but that seem to many to have grown more powerful than the government. But a broad range of Jamaicans, from business leaders to the country&apos;s leading human rights group, have warned that growing evidence the army killed unarmed men after Coke&apos;s fighters fled threatens to wreck the campaign. The island&apos;s principal human rights group, Jamaicans For Justice (JFJ), said that excesses by the security forces in pursuit of Coke would &quot;seriously undermine any opportunity to bring about the change well-thinking Jamaicans yearn for&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re going to need credible security forces acting lawfully to take us out of the mess of criminality we have landed in by our unfortunate history,&quot; said the head of the JFJ, Carolyn Gomes. For a start, the security forces are having to explain how it is that Coke has so far been able to evade the biggest operation of its kind in Jamaica&apos;s history. &quot;We have not failed in our mission,&quot; said the police commissioner, Owen Ellington. &quot;Five days ago, there were concerns as to whether the security forces have the capacity and the will to go inside Tivoli Gardens, disrupt Christopher Coke in his stronghold, and arrest him. Today, he&apos;s on the run. We will catch him and he will face justice. &quot;In the meantime, we pursue the larger operation of degrading the criminal capacity of a gang which for many years held a community hostage and threatened the security of citizens. We are making tremendous success. It&apos;s never been like this before for law enforcement.&quot; Police say that eight of a dozen dons have been captured or turned themselves in. Among those hunted are men who go by the nicknames Pepsi, Fidel, Tel Aviv, Prince Pow, Cutter and Alcapone. The violence in Tivoli Gardens began when Coke&apos;s men launched a pre-emptive strike after the government announced its intention to extradite him, attacking 14 police stations. Three were set on fire and two of those burned to the ground. Those attacks were intended to remind the government and the security forces who was the boss inside Tivoli Gardens and the other gang strongholds known as garrisons. Coke&apos;s fighters and local residents prepared for a siege. They established sniper positions on high-rise flats overlooking the road in and barricaded streets with burnt-out cars and sandbags. The military released pictures of homemade bombs it said were constructed of plastic explosive and ball bearings. The army says that when troops advanced on the neighbourhood they were met with such a barrage of fire that at one point it took three hours to advance just 200 yards. &quot;We discovered very sophisticated defences,&quot; said Colonel Rocky Meade. Yet in the end, only one soldier was killed while 73 civilians are dead. Two policemen were killed separately. Tellingly, the military seized relatively few weapons, so far only about 20. The failure to find large numbers of guns suggests that Coke&apos;s men got away with their weapons. Some of Tivoli Gardens&apos; residents say they slipped out of the area after the first day of fighting and that the soldiers then moved in and killed young men who were left, even though they were not armed. Ellington denied witness accounts that bodies had been burnt or buried illicitly. Yet a handful of rotting corpses lay on the ground or in open coffins in the May Pen cemetery and local people said soldiers had buried others, some two to a coffin. Gomes said Jamaicans for Justice has documented years of abuse, including extra-judicial executions by the army and police and that she is not surprised by accounts of such killings. Vaz said he recognises the government needs to address the allegations if it is to maintain public support for further action. &quot;It is no secret that there has been a growing mistrust of the police and military over the years. There have been several reports of misconduct, breaches of constitutional rights. Action will have to be taken if we are not to further erode the credibility of the security forces.&quot; There is a widespread recognition that even if Coke is extradited or killed, there are plenty of others willing to fill his shoes. Joseph Matalon, president of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, concedes that a political and economic culture has developed that needs to be upended. &quot;We have to accept that we are part of the problem,&quot; he said, before admitting that, like many of the island&apos;s businessmen, he feeds contracts to &quot;area leaders&quot; who belong to the gangs. &quot;We don&apos;t pass an envelope, but we have in the past, and even now given construction work to the area leaders. That cuts across large swaths of the private sector and that&apos;s something that will have to change,&quot; said Matalon. But the most fundamental change will be in addressing the needs of the very poor who have for so long provided the dons with support because the state has all but abandoned them. Gomes doubts if change will come. &quot;I hear the words; I await the actions,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s a very complex problem that is going to require very complex solutions. We need to begin the process of the reintegration of these people, allowing them to feel that they have an equal role in Jamaica, that they have an equal opportunity. We haven&apos;t seen anything of that.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-05-29T23:04:12Z", "title": "Jamaicans see little to choose between drug gangs and bloodstained soldiers", "sentences": ["Among those hunted are men who go by the nicknames Pepsi, Fidel, Tel Aviv, Prince Pow, Cutter and Alcapone."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/30/jamaica-police-killings-drug-war"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Turkey", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": " 9.10am:  More than 10 people have been killed after Israeli naval commandos boarded six aid ships in a convoy heading towards the Gaza Strip.

According to the live video from the ship, two have been killed, and 31 injured. Al-Jazeera has just confirmed the numbers.  9.20am:  Here&apos;s the full statement from the Israel ministry of foreign affairs. In the interests of fairness I will post the full response from the Free Gaza Movement in the next post.      Early this morning (31 May), IDF naval forces intercepted six ships attempting to break the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. This happened after numerous warnings from Israel and the Israel navy that were issued prior to the action. The Israel navy requested the ships to redirect toward Ashdod where they would be able to unload their aid material which would then be transferred over land after undergoing security inspections. During the interception of the ships, the demonstrators onboard attacked the IDF naval personnel with live fire and light weaponry including knives and clubs. Additionally one of the weapons used was grabbed from an IDF soldier. The demonstrators had clearly prepared their weapons in advance for this specific purpose. As a result of this life-threatening and violent activity, naval forces employed riot dispersal means, including live fire. According to initial reports, these events resulted in over 10 deaths among the demonstrators and numerous injured; in addition, more than four naval personnel were injured, some from gunfire and some from various other weapons. Two of the soldiers are moderately wounded and the remainder sustained light injuries. All of the injured, Israelis and foreigners are currently being evacuated by helicopter to hospitals in Israel. Reports from IDF forces on the scene are that it seems as if part of the participants onboard the ships were planning to lynch the forces. The events are ongoing, and information will be updated as soon as possible. Israeli naval commander, vice admiral Eliezer Marom is overseeing the events. In the coming hours, the ships will be directed to the Ashdod port, while IDF naval forces will perform security checks in order to identify the people on board the ships and their equipment. The IDF spokesman conveys that this event is currently unfolding and further details will be provided as soon as possible. This IDF naval operation was carried out under orders from the political leadership to halt the flotilla from reaching the Gaza Strip and breaching the naval blockade. The interception of the flotilla followed numerous warnings given to the organisers of the flotilla before leaving their ports as well as while sailing towards the Gaza Strip. In these warnings, it was made clear to the organisers that they could dock in the Ashdod sea port and unload the equipment they are carrying in order to deliver it to the Gaza Strip in an orderly manner, following the appropriate security checks. Upon expressing their unwillingness to cooperate and arrive at the port, it was decided to board the ships and lead them to Ashdod. IDF naval personnel encountered severe violence, including use of weaponry prepared in advance in order to attack and to harm them. The forces operated in adherence with operational commands and took all necessary actions in order to avoid violence, but to no avail.  9.24am:  This is a rather different version of events from the Free Gaza Movement, which had two boats in the &quot;Freedom Flotilla&quot;:      Under darkness of night, Israeli commandoes dropped from a helicopter onto the Turkish passenger ship, Mavi Marmara, and began to shoot the moment their feet hit the deck. They fired directly into the crowd of civilians asleep. According to the live video from the ship, two have been killed, and 31 injured. Al-Jazeera has just confirmed the numbers. Streaming video shows the Israeli soldiers shooting at civilians, and our last SPOT beacon said: &quot;HELP, we are being contacted by the Israelis.&quot; We know nothing about the other five boats. Israel says they are taking over the boats. The coalition of Free Gaza Movement (FG), European Campaign to End the Siege of Gaza (ECESG), Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH), the Perdana Global Peace Organisation, Ship to Gaza Greece, Ship to Gaza Sweden, and the International Committee to Lift the Siege on Gaza appeal to the international community to demand that Israel stop their brutal attack on civilians delivering vitally needed aid to the imprisoned Palestinians of Gaza and permit the ships to continue on their way. The attack has happened in international waters, 75 miles off the coast of Israel, in direct violation of international law.             .  9.34am:  This video has been posted to YouTube by the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs. It appears to show an Israeli official issuing a warning to the flotilla.  9.43am:  ABC News is reporting that two Australians who were travelling on one of the aid boats have not been heard from since they were boarded. The journalist Paul McGeough and photographer Kate Geraghty have apparently not made contact with Fairfax, the Australian media company, in the last six hours.      An Australian journalist and photographer onboard aid boats headed for the Gaza Strip have not been heard from since at least 10 people were reportedly killed during a clash with Israeli commandos. A Fairfax spokesman says journalist Paul McGeough and photographer Kate Geraghty last made contact around noon (AEST) today while onboard the MV Samoud. Israel&apos;s defence force says at least 10 people were killed when commandos stormed a convoy of six ships carrying aid to Gaza. It was led by a Turkish vessel with 600 people on board and set sail for Gaza from international waters off Cyprus on Sunday in defiance of an Israeli-led blockade of the territory.  9.51am:             Sky News has posted this footage to its YouTube channel, some of which appears to have been shot on one of the ships. The video also looks to show some of the injured.  9.59am:  Our Jerusalem correspondent Harriet Sherwood is at a hospital in Ashkelon where she says the injured are arriving.       Sheikh Rayed Salah, leading Islamist figure among Arab citizens of Israel, undergoing emergency surgery. He is an important man. #flotilla Harriet is posting regular updates on Twitter and is well worth keeping an eye on.  10.12am:  Alison Flood reports from the Guardian Hay Festival that the Swedish author Henning Mankell is caught up in the saga. &quot;Mankell is believed to be on the aid convoy which was heading for Palestine. The bestselling Swedish writer and creator of the Wallander detective series was scheduled to speak at the Hay Festival this weekend, but was forced to pull out after the flotilla was delayed as it negotiated entry into Israeli waters. He was set to be beamed in live from the boat for an evening appearance on Saturday evening with Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif and interviewer Jon Snow, but the link didn&apos;t work; festival organisers called him numerous times but failed to connect.&quot;  10.18am:  Israel&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs has updated its account of the clash on its website. The ministry says pistols were found on two activists.      &quot;According to reports from sea, on board the flotilla that was seeking to break the maritime closure on the Gaza Strip, IDF forces apprehended two violent activists holding pistols. The violent activists took these pistols from IDF forces and apparently opened fire on the soldiers as evident by the empty pistol magazines.&quot; Israel says more than four naval personnel were injured, &quot;some from gunfire and some from various other weapons&quot;. Two of the soldiers are moderately wounded, the minstry says, and the two others sustained light injuries.             .  10.27am:  This video from al-Jazeera English, who had a correspondent on one of the ships, appears to show troops boarding a vessel.  10.38am:  A source from the Free Gaza Movement has told the Guardian that 19 people are believed dead. There were 27 Britons on board the ships, the contact says, including Sarah Colvin from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Kevin Ovenden.  Apparently the Britons are mostly on the Turkish ships, which the source says were attacked in international waters, not Israeli waters, which they say is technically an act of piracy. There were eight ships in the flotilla, three of which the Free Gaza source names as 8,000 \u2013 a reference to the number of Palestinians in Israeli jails \u2013 Freedom and Rachel Corrie. Three of the ships were from turkey, paid for by the main Turkish charity, IHH, three were from Greece, while one sailed from Ireland and the final ship possibly came from Algeria. The dead possibly including Sheikh Ra&apos;ed Salah, the leader of the Islamic movement in Israel, according to the source, who says all contact with the ships is now lost.  10.44am:  Estimates of the number of people dead are varying \u2013 some sources saying 10, others 16, some 19.Here&apos;s Harriet Sherwood&apos;s piece from Ashdod, where some of the boats are reported to be arriving.  10.54am:  Alison Flood has just spoken to Mikael L\u00f6fgren, spokesman for the ship Henning Mankell is on: &quot;We haven&apos;t heard from them since 5 this morning Swedish time,&quot; L\u00f6fgren said. &quot;They were telling us then about the israeli soldiers climbing into the neighbouring ship, and they heard shooting aboard it. I was not speaking to Henning but to one of his friends. The Swedish ship was attacked a bit later, 10-15 minutes later. The whole attack was done between 4-5 o&apos;clock Swedish time. &quot; &quot;We don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened since. When the ships were attacked the Israelis cut off all communications and we haven&apos;t heard from them since. As we speak I can see the ships coming into the harbour of Ashdod [on television] so I presume that&apos;s them.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t know if they&apos;re alright [including Mankell in that]. The numbers of the killed and wounded are rising all the time. The latest information is talking about 19 deaths. It&apos;s a really awful thing.&quot;  10.59am:  Declan Walsh, the Guardian&apos;s foreign correspondent for Pakistan and Afghanistan, emails: The Pakistani foreign ministry has issued a statement expressing concern about the fate of one of the country&apos;s best-known television journalists, Talat Hussain, who&apos;s on board the flotilla, along with a local peace activist. Hussain&apos;s employer, Aaj television, says it hasn&apos;t heard from him since 6am (Pakistan time). Declan says Pakistan and Israel &quot;do not have diplomatic relations \u2013 in fact you can&apos;t even find Israel&apos;s code in the phonebooks here&quot;. Here&apos;s the full statement from Pakistan:  The government of Pakistan strongly condemns the use of brazen force by Israel against a humanitarian mission that was embarked on delivering humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in Gaza. The killing of members of this humanitarian mission, which also included women, is brutal, inhuman and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and norms.  The government of Pakistan is seriously concerned over the well-being and whereabouts of the Pakistani citizens and media personnel including Syed Talat Hussain and Raza Mahmood Agha who were on board the flotilla bound for Gaza.  The foreign ministry is in constant touch with its missions in the region to ascertain the well-being of our nationals.    11.04am:  Israel has advised its citizens to avoid travel to Turkey following &quot;massive protests&quot; there, Associated Press is reporting. &quot;The Monday advisory instructs Israelis already in Turkey to keep a low profile and avoid crowded downtown areas,&quot; the news agency said. It adds that Turkey is just an hour&apos;s flight away and is a popular holiday destination for Israelis.  11.08am:  Ben Folley has emailed to point out that I&apos;ve erred in my 10.38am post, naming a couple of Britons on board. Sarah Colvin should read Sarah Colborne \u2013 she is director of campaigns at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Kevin Ovenden is from the Viva Palestina charity.  11.19am:  @justicentric has got in touch on Twitter to point me to this raw footage of scenes on one of the ships.            If you&apos;ve spotted anything you think I should be including in here, or if there&apos;s an angle or aspect you want us to follow up, give me a shout on Twitter @adamgabbatt or email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk  11.29am:  The Los Angeles Times is reporting that there were around 10,000 demonstrators marching in Turkey, some of whom tried to storm Israel&apos;s consulate building in Istanbul.      Their article has a good round up of reaction from around the globe, here&apos;s a snippet:  In Jordan, hundreds demonstrated in the capital, Amman, to protest the Israeli action and demand that their government breaks diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. The Israeli ambassadors in Sweden, Spain, Denmark and Greece were summoned for meetings, and the French foreign minister called for an investigation. Activists from all of those European countries were on board the flotilla. Besides swift, angry reaction from the Palestinians, strong condemnation came from the United Nations and the European Union. Greece suspended a military exercise with Israel, and the Arab League called an emergency meeting. The United Nations expressed &quot;shock&quot; and condemned the killings. &quot;We are in contact with the Israeli authorities to express our deep concern and to seek a full explanation,&quot; said a statement from the highest-ranking UN official in the region, Robert Serry.   11.34am:  The diplomatic row has stepped up a gear, with Turkey announcing it has withdrawn its ambassador to Israel, according to Turkey&apos;s state-run agency. Associated Press is also reporting that the Turkish deputy prime minister has announced Turkey is cancelling military drills with Israel. More soon.  11.45am:       @martin_eve @adamgabbatt &quot;could we have some coverage on the fact that #Israel and #flotilla are not showing as trending topics on Twitter. Censorship?&quot; There&apos;s quite a discussion of this going on on Twitter, with a lot of people suggesting using #FreedomFlotilla as the tag for posts. Flotilla certainly doesn&apos;t appear in the Twitter trending lists, but some users are suggesting it can&apos;t become a trending topic as &apos;Flotilla&apos; is a registered Twitter account: @MoneyMunot &quot;twitter ain&apos;t blocking it... @flotilla is a twitter account, registered in NY/Montreal, that&apos;s why it can&apos;t trend...&quot; Not sure if that is true or not. I seem to remember Twitter accounts trending before. Suggestions welcome  11.53am:       @scordale @adamgabbatt &quot;Did you notice if you search #flotilla it comes up with &apos;technical problem&apos; why is this, are we being censored? Worrying.&quot; Just tried the search for #flotilla myself and it doesn&apos;t seem to be working. And lots of people pointing out on Twitter that @freedomflotilla is a registered user, but is still trending. Are #flotilla posts being restricted?  11.57am:  My colleague Maev Kennedy emails:  In a statement this morning, the Irish minister for foreign affairs, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said he was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; over the incident. He said the department was seeking to confirm the safety of the eight Irish nationals who sailed with the Turkish led flotilla. &quot;The reports of up to 15 people killed and 50 injured, if confirmed, would constitute a totally unacceptable response by the Israeli military to what was a humanitarian mission attempting to deliver much needed supplies to the people of Gaza.&quot;   12.32pm:       The foreign secretary, William Hague, has called on the government of Israel to open all crossings for aid to enter Gaza and deplored the loss of life during the interception of the Gaza flotilla.   &quot;\u202a\u202aI deplore the loss of life during the interception of the Gaza flotilla. Our embassy is in urgent contact with the Israeli government. We are asking for more information and urgent access to any UK nationals involved.\u202a \u202a We have consistently advised against attempting to access Gaza in this way, because of the risks involved. But at the same time, there is a clear need for Israel to act with restraint and in line with international obligations. It will be important to establish the facts about this incident, and especially whether enough was done to prevent deaths and injuries. \u202a This news underlines the need to lift the restrictions on access to Gaza, in line with UNSCR 1860. The closure is unacceptable and counter-productive. There can be no better response from the international community to this tragedy than to achieve urgently a durable resolution to the Gaza crisis. I call on the government of Israel to open the crossings to allow unfettered access for aid to Gaza, and address the serious concerns about the deterioration in the humanitarian and economic situation and about the effect on a generation of young Palestinians\u202a.&quot;  In other news, I am being ridiculed by colleagues for being a crazed conspiracy theorist (see 11.53am). Apologies. Here&apos;s the Guardian&apos;s Charles Arthur, someone who actually knows what he&apos;s talking about, on why #flotilla wasn&apos;t trending.  12.45pm:  The Stop the War coalition is organising a protest outside Downing Street at 2pm today.  &quot;Yet another act of Israeli barbarism as its forces storm one of the seven ships on the international flotilla taking aid to Gaza, where Israel&apos;s illegal seige is starving Palestinians of essential resources. At least 20 activists on board are reported to have been killed by Israeli forces. Please join the emergency demonstration today if you can. Publicise it as widely as possible by email, text, Facebook, Twitter etc.&quot;  We&apos;ll have more on that as it happens.  12.53pm:  I&apos;ve just spoken to the brother of Jamal Elshayyal, a 25-year-old producer for al-Jazeera English who was reporting from one of the ships when it was boarded. Abdul Rahman, 31, says his family have not been able to contact Jamal since the clashes. The family have been speaking to the Foreign Office, but have been unable to find out if Jamal is safe.  Abdule says you can see Jamal briefly in one of the videos below. Writing a longer post now.  1.20pm:  The shadow Foreign Secretary David Miliband, has issued a statement saying he is &quot;deeply concerned by the incidents overnight.&quot; Full text:  As I said in the House of Commons last week, a policy of neglect of Gaza is bound to fail. The terrible death toll of the last 24 hours and the consequences for international relations demonstrate the urgency of international action in support of UN Resolution 1860. I fully support the European Union&apos;s call for a full investigation into this most recent incident. The killing of innocent civilians is always to be condemned. The humanitarian suffering in Gaza is completely unjustified and self defeating for all those concerned with political progress in the Middle East. Vital supplies must be allowed into Gaza and the futile loss of civilian lives in this tragedy only increases that requirement. My thoughts are with the families of those who have been killed and injured. My thoughts are also with the future of the Middle East. The UK is a member of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union. It is vital that we make our voice heard both in respect of this immediate incident and for a comprehensive drive for peace. That is what I look for the Government urgently to provide.   1.29pm:  Alison Flood has learnt that the Irish activist Caoimhe Butterly was in the flotilla. Alison is at Hay festival, where she&apos;s been speaking to the barrister Michael Mansfield. &quot;The main thing is that it was done in international waters which is illegal,&quot; he said. &quot;And it was not a convoy carrying military personnel. Israel does exactly what it wants and nobody lifts a finger. It&apos;s absolutely outrageous.&quot; He pointed to an article in the Guardian in December by Nick Clegg, inwhich the deputy PM said that the international community has got to do something if Israel doesn&apos;t end the blockade. &quot;I&apos;m afraid he&apos;s got to be put on the spot when Philippe Sands interviews him [at Hay],&quot; Mansfield said. &quot;Never mind the Iraq war - this is far more serious.&quot; The Sauce news blog has posted a piece saying pressure is mounting on Clegg, given his article, which appeared in Comment is Free last year. &quot;The question this afternoon - as hundreds of protesters head to Downing Street to demand Government action - is whether Nick Clegg will sit on his hands in a further humiliating compromise with his new Conservative masters,&quot; the piece says.  1.36pm:  Ian Black, the Guardian&apos;s Middle East editor writes:      Commentators in Israel have drawing parallels between the Gaza flotilla incident and a similar case in 1988.  It was the second year of the first Palestinian intifada and the PLO leader Yasser Arafat, organized a group of Palestinian refugees and international supporters to board a &quot;refugee ship&quot; in Cyprus. The ship was given the symbolic name &quot;al-Awda&quot; (The Return).  The plan was to sail it to an Israeli port, forcing Israel either to sink or board the ship or let it land its refugees demanding their &quot;right of return.&quot; Large numbers of journalists and observers were also on hand.  On February 14, the night before the ship was due to set sail, it was mysteriously blown up in Limassol harbour.  Responsibility for the sinking was never claimed but it was reported later that it was the work of an Israeli naval commando unit called Flotilla 13.  &quot;It&apos;s not enough to be right,&quot; pundit Yoni Ben-Menachem told Israel Radio today. &quot;You have to be smart as well.&quot;  1.49pm:  I&apos;ve just spoken to Lauren Booth, sister of Cherie Blair, who was on the first ever Free Gaza mission that left from Cyprus in August 2008. She&apos;s calling for the Foreign Office to expell Israeli diplomats, pending a full inquiry. Booth has been helping the Free Gaza movement since 2008, and knows &quot;dozens and dozens&quot; on the boats. Booth says she&apos;s &quot;worried sick&quot; about the protestors. &quot;I woke this morning to a voice message from my friend Osama, who said &apos;We&apos;re being apporoached by two Israeli naval ships and we&apos;re about to be aggressively boarded, please help&apos;.&quot; &quot;I have friends there who I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re dead or alive,&quot; Booth said. &quot;What we should be concentrating on is getting the British government to tell families the names of the dead, the names of the injured and taking action to ensure the safety and well being of everybody else on board. &quot;The only weapons taken onto that ship were taken by the Israeli military, who boarded them between 3.30 and 4.30am, when unarmed people were asleep. Booth said the flotilla was populated by &quot;normal people from around the world&quot;. &quot;We had some parliamentarians, there are doctors there are nurses, there are teachers. &quot;These are people who&apos;ve chosen to leave their everyday lives to do something good for humanity and this is what they&apos;ve been met with.&quot;  1.55pm:  More on the Israeli government warning its citizens not to travel to Turkey: the Jerusalem Post is reporting the Israeli Counter Terrorism Bureau has said &quot;violent outbreaks&quot; are likely against Israelis. &quot;In response to the events surrounding the protest flotilla, there are growing protests by the government and public in Turkey,&quot; the National Security Council Counter-Terrorism Bureau said. &quot;This delicate state of affairs is liable to deteriorate into violent outbreaks against Israelis in Turkey.&quot;  2.02pm:  The Guardian&apos;s Jack Shenker sends this from Egypt: &quot;Demonstrations have broken out in the streets around the foreign ministry in the capital, currently a few hundred strong and including a number of opposition MPs and pro-democracy activist groups. Egypt&apos;s government has condemned the attack and reportedly summoned the Israeli ambassador for talks.&quot;  Two Egyptian MPs were reportedly on the flotilla, we&apos;re trying to find out more details.  2.35pm:  Hundreds of people are gathering outside Downing Street. @jogillette, who has been tremendously helpful all day, has pointed me to this video by Sally Sami of the demonstration. If you&apos;re out demonstrating in London, or anywhere else for that matter, get in touch. You can Twitter at me @adamgabbatt or email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk. Videos/pictures/accounts all welcome.  2.51pm:  The Israeli Defence Force has released footage that it says shows IDF naval personnel being attacked as they board one of the ships in the flotilla.            &quot;Reports from IDF forces on the scene are that it seems as if part of the participants onboard the ships were planning to lynch the forces,&quot; the IDF said. This is disputed by people close to those in the fleet.  3.20pm:       Bit of a round up. Israel&apos;s prime minister has expressed his support for the military&apos;s action. Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s office says he spoke Monday to top Israeli diplomatic and security officials by telephone from Canada and voiced his &quot;full backing&quot; for the military. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has cancelled a planned visit to the White House to deal with the Gaza crisis. The prime minister was set to travel to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama on Tuesday, but his office says he has now decided to return home early. Earlier the Obama administration voiced concern about the events. White House spokesman Bill Burton said the United States &quot;deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained&quot; in the incident.  Burton said administration officials are &quot;currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.&quot; Earlier around 10,000 Turks marched in protest from the Israeli consulate in Istanbul to a main square, chanting, &quot;Murderous Israel you will drown in the blood you shed!&quot;  Israel has warned citizens not to travel to Turkey, saying there is a risk of them being attacked. The protesters earlier tried to storm the Consulate building but were blocked by police. Around 1,000 people have been demonstrating in Jordan&apos;s capital, Amman, calling for their government to cut diplomatic ties with Israel, AP is reporting. The news agency says smaller protests have erupted in capitals across the Middle East as well as in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, the Greek city of Thessaloniki and the Pakistani city of Karachi. Protests are underway in London at the moment, more on those shortly.  3.32pm:       @MadamMiaow has pointed me to a blogpost from Kevin Ovenden, a Briton from the Viva Palestina charity who was on the Mavi Marmara in the flotilla (see 11.08am).  Ovenden appears to have been writing as Israel boats approached the flotilla.  We are 90 miles away from land - 22 miles further than the Israeli decided 68 mile exclusion zone - but are being approached by an Israeli vessel. [...] This is a very serious situation, and we are calling on everyone to play their part in helping ensure their safety, and that the aid reaches Gaza without difficulty.  Full article here.  3.44pm:  Lots of people tweeting from the London protest, thanks for the contributions. The demonstrators are now marching to the Israeli embassy, it seems. Unconfirmed reports that over 1,000 people have turned out to protest.  Here&apos;s a selection of updates from people in the crowd.      @underattack86 @adamgabbatt protesting in London, huge turn-out! About to march on the embassy. Police looking edgy... @emilysbishop @adamgabbatt march heading to Israeli Embassy, emphatic requests by organisers for peaceful &amp; safe protest  @GuidoTallman @adamgabbatt London protest now left Whitehall and marching on the Israeli Embassy #gaza flotilla  @jungleline @adamgabbatt 1000+ protestors at Downing St, now marching to Israeli embassy  4.22pm:  \u2022 Luke Harding, the Guardian&apos;s Moscow correspondent, has sent this:  Russia has become the latest country to slam Israel&apos;s attack on the Gaza-bound aid convoy, with Moscow this afternoon expressing its &apos;deep anxiety&apos; over the incident.  It described the assault by Israeli commandos as a &apos;gross&apos; violation of international law and called for a thorough investigation. &apos;Use of weapons against civilians and detaining ships in the open sea without any legal reason constitute obvious and gross violations of generally accepted legal standards,&apos; Russia&apos;s foreign ministry said today in a statement.  It called for the &apos;earliest possible lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza&apos; and for &apos;practical moves to improve the humanitarian and social situation for the people of the region.&apos;  \u2022 Giles Tremlett, for the Guardian in Madrid, emails:  A journalist from Spain&apos;s El Pa\u00eds newspaper, Ana Carbajosa, says she managed to speak briefly to one of the injured as he was taken from an ambulance on a stretcher in Ashdod, where the flotilla vessels are arriving.  The man, who spoke with an American accent and had a black eye but did not give his name, apparently came from the Sfendoni vessel \u2013 adding further weight to evidence that violence had also been used there. &quot;We are not violent. They have used unnecessary brutality,&quot; the man said, according to the Spanish translation of his words. &quot;&quot;We are all Palestinians. More freedom is needed.&quot;  The El Pa\u00eds thread on the attack has received more than 1,100 comments posted by readers \u2013 most of them outraged.  \u2022 Dorian Jones, in Turkey, has been speaking to Suat Kiniklioglu, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Turkish Parliament. Kiniklioglu has issued a statement calling on the international community to work to end the embargo against Gaza. &quot;Turkish-Israeli relations have suffered an immeasurable blow,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Regional players and particularly the US must step up to the plate and deal with this issue. Otherwise we will see a serious deterioration of regional and international security with concrete repercussions for all.  &quot;The international community&apos;s response to this incident will be key in understanding where we are headed on this issue.&quot;  4.43pm:  Turkey&apos;s prime minister has spoken for the first time since Israeli commandos boarded the flotilla, as the Assocated Press news agency reports that most of the dead are Turkish. PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the fatal raid as &quot;state terrorism.&quot; Speaking from Chile, he said Israel has shown that it does not want peace in the region and has violated international law. Erdogan said Turkey will call on Nato to convene in an emergency session to discuss the incident. It has made a similar plea to the UN Security Council. The prime minister has cut short his Latin America tour to deal with the fall out from the deaths.  AP news agency is reporting that a high ranking naval official who spoke to reporters on a naval vessel off the coast, told journalists most of the dead were Turkish. The official displayed a box confiscated from the boat containing switchblades, slingshots, metal balls and metal bats, it said.&quot;We prepared (the soldiers) to deal with peace activists, not to fight,&quot; the man said, adding that most of the dead were Turkish. AP has also spoken to a naval commano, identified only as &quot;A&quot;, who was one of the party who boarded vessels. He said he and his colleagues were taken off guard by a group of Arabic-speaking men when they rappelled onto the deck. Some of the soldiers were stripped of their helmets and equipment and thrown from the top deck to the lower deck, he told the news agency, and said some had even jumped overboard to save themselves. At one point one of the activists seized one of the soldiers&apos; weapons and opened fire, the commando said.  5.06pm:  This video, from dominickavakeb, shows part of the protest underway in London. The demonstrators are currently gathered near the Israeli Embassy. Here&apos;s the latest from a couple of people sending updates from the crowd. @lazaroumterror @adamgabbatt &quot;Kensington High street. Met by more protestors. Chants of &quot;Israeli Piracy&quot; &amp; &quot;shut down the embassy&quot;&quot; #FreedomFlotilla  @foto8 London demo cvrg @adamgabbatt: paused near hydepark cnr. #freedomflotilla http://twitpic.com/1srvao (via @tristamsparks)             Protests have taken place across Europe this afternoon, while there is a demonstration planned outside the Israeli consulate in Toronto, Canada this evening. There are also reports of a peace vigil gathering taking place in Boston, US, tonight.  5.10pm:       Harriet Sherwood, the Guardian&apos;s Jerusalem correspondent, has been speaking to the relative of one of the Britons in the flotilla.  Sandra Law, the mother of Alex Harrison, a 31-year-old British woman who was on board the Challenger 1, claimed that the Foreign Office had &quot;totally refused&quot; to provide information or assistance to her family. &quot;They were obstructive to say the least,&quot; said Law, 63, from Croydon. &quot;We rang them last night to say the flotilla was being threatened by the Israeli navy. They totally refused to help us.&quot; She added that the British Embassy in Tel Aviv &quot;were also useless.&quot;&quot;I&apos;m extremely worried about Alex,&quot; she told the Guardian. &quot;We have no idea what has happened to her. But she&apos;s an experienced human rights defender and very level headed. &quot;I am really concerned that our government won&apos;t speak out over Israel. They have said that human rights is at the heart of their foreign policy. Well, you tell me.&quot; She described yesterday&apos;s military operation as &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;unforgivable&quot;.   5.24pm:  Channel 4 news is reporting that the death toll &quot;could be as high as 19&quot;.      The news channel also says it has been told of violent clashes on another vessel in the flotilla.  Channel 4 News has learnt 16 people are feared dead following the clashes. Another unconfirmed report puts the toll at 19. A spokesperson for &quot;Freedom Flotilla&quot; says three people are hurt on another boat, believed to be a joint Greek and Swedish vessel. The captain is reportedly among the injured.   5.41pm:  More on some of the protests around the UK \u2013\u00a0Somhairle Maguire has emailed from Northern Ireland:  A quick note to say about 400 people turned out in Belfast city centre, outside the City Hall, in protest. Lasted around an hour, from four to five, with a few local councillors and West Belfast MP Gerry Adams in attendance. Was a good showing for this city, especially at such short notice, this incident seems to have caused more than the usual amount of rage and disbelief.

More on that as I can get it.  6.13pm:      Protestors in Bristol. Image: Jon Wiltshire    @jonwiltshire has posted pictures of the Bristol Gaza protests to Flickr. Sorry I haven&apos;t been able to use other images people have been sending \u2013 slight technical difficulties. Associated Press is reporting that Israeli officials have said the death toll is nine with 30 wounded, after earlier saying 10 people were killed. Apparently the revised toll came after Israel had brought all six boats in the flotilla under control.  6.27pm:  The Guardian&apos;s Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell emails:  A Scottish journalist and documentary film maker, Hassan Ghani, 24, is one of the Britons on board the Turkish vessel attacked by Israeli forces. A former Stirling university student from the west end of Glasgow, he was seen broadcasting for the satellite station PressTV as the commandos took control of the ship. In footage shown on YouTube, Ghani said: &quot;This is the Mavi Marmara, Hassan Ghani reporting for PressTV. We&apos;ve had several injuries here; one is critical. He has been injured in the head and we think he may die if he doesn&apos;t receive medical treatment urgently. &quot;Another person being passed in front of me right now has been seriously injured. We being hit by tear gas, stun grenades. We&apos;ve navy ships on either side. We&apos;re being attacked from every single side. This is international waters and not Israeli waters, not in the 68 mile exclusion zone. We&apos;re being attacked in international waters completely illegally.&quot; His father, Haq Ghani, a businessman who runs an Islamic information service called Noah&apos;s Ark, told the BBC he had asked the foreign office for news about his son but had been told anything. &quot;I am extremely angry, dismayed and shocked upon hearing about the deplorable loss of life upon the peace flotilla, as a result of typically disproportionate and aggressive actions by the Israeli Defence Forces,&quot; he said. &quot;On a personal note, my family and I are fraught with worry for our son. On his last posting on Facebook he made mention that Israeli ships were spotted on the radar and since then we have heard nothing from him.&quot;  Severin says you can see Hassan in the YouTube video I posted at 11.19am \u2013 he appears from around 19 seconds in.  6.57pm:  That&apos;s all from me for today. Thanks so much for all contributions, sorry I couldn&apos;t use everything I was sent. The Israeli Defence Force has said nine are dead following last night&apos;s events. It has posted another video to YouTube showing Israeli naval commandoes descending onto one of the ships in the flotilla.            We&apos;ll carry on posting and updating the website with the latest through the night, as (hopefully) members of the flotilla are able to get in touch with their home countries and families, so keep checking back. In the meantime here&apos;s a background on the Free Gaza movement, and more information on the blockade. There&apos;s also more from Ian Black, the Guardian&apos;s Middle East editor, on the diplomatic implications for Israel.

Foreign Policy&apos;s Josh Landis, for example, suggests that unconditional US support for Israel will draw Moscow back into its pre-1989 role as supporter and arms supplier for the enemies of Tel Aviv and Washington. Yet Russia&apos;s return to Syria, whether it be the sale of MiG-29s or building a naval dock on the Syrian coast, is not the action of a superpower challenging US hegemony as it was in 1945-89 but rather an assertive regional power taking advantage of the emerging power vacuum in the region. Instead of a new bi-polar cold war, regional powers such as Russia and Turkey are increasing their influence at the United States&apos; expense. The idea of a new cold war has gained currency in some quarters for the wrong reasons. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad himself told La Repubblica last week that &quot;Russia is reasserting itself. And the cold war is just a natural reaction to the attempt by America to dominate the world&quot;. In the same interview he asserted that there was a new triple alliance between Syria, Turkey and Iran \u2013 part of a &quot;northern alliance&quot; that Damascus has been trying to construct against Israel and the US \u2013 with Russia now cast in the role as superpower benefactor. As leader of a small power attempting to defy the global hegemon, it is in Assad&apos;s interests to exaggerate the strength of such an alliance. Yet no such cohesive united bloc actually exists. Russia is pursuing a realist regional agenda, ensuring it can maximise its influence without unnecessarily confronting the US \u2013 a cornerstone of Dmitry Medvedev&apos;s foreign policy. A recent spat with Tehran over Russian support for Washington&apos;s new UN sanctions on Iran hardly suggests a united anti-American/anti-Israeli front. Turkey, too, is not tying itself to any camp. Damascus may regard Ankara&apos;s rekindled relationship with Iraq, Iran and Syria as crucial for any new alignment, but Turkey&apos;s &quot;zero problems with neighbours&quot; policy is not limited to those states on its southern border. Turkey is seeking influence and markets for its rapidly expanding economy across the region, including Israel. Though prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan&apos;s rhetoric has been increasingly populist and anti-Israeli since the Gaza war of 2008-2009, the deep commercial, economic and military ties between the Turkish and Israeli establishments show no signs of receding. Like Russia, Turkey is pursuing its own interests by asserting its influence in the whole Middle East, not just as the lynchpin of an anti-America/Israel bloc. Yet even though the return to cold war bi-polar blocs in the Middle East is unlikely, the region&apos;s international relations are changing. US power is waning. Though Washington remains the world&apos;s only superpower, the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan have exposed the limits of US ambitions, while the economic crisis has forced the Obama administration to focus energy elsewhere. While the Bush era saw the US hegemonic in the region, squeezing the defiant few like Syria and Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq, today&apos;s Middle East sees a power vacuum led by partial US retreat being filled by assertive regional and middle powers. Turkey and Brazil&apos;s recent nuclear deal with Iran typify this emerging new climate. Stephen Walt has highlighted that this shift in power is global, with Asia&apos;s share of GDP already outstripping that of the US or Europe. As ever, it seems the Middle East could prove a microcosm of these international changes. If the age of American uni-polarity is coming to an end, perhaps hastened by unnecessary wars and economic shortsightedness, it is much more likely that international relations in the Middle East will come to reflect the multi-polar world that will follow rather than revert to a bi-polar cold war. In such circumstances, it won&apos;t just be Russia and Turkey expanding their reach in the region, but China, India and Brazil will all bid for a role, too \u2013 presumably having fewer demands than Washington about their clients pursuing democratic reforms and peace with Israel. Saudi Arabia&apos;s growing relationship with China might signify the shape of things to come. Not that this era is yet upon us. The US remains the superpower and could still effect serious change in the region, should it desire. However, the recent actions of Russia and Turkey in the Middle East do show a new assertiveness from regional powers to pursue their own path in defiance of US will, whether through arms deals, trade agreements or diplomatic coups. A new cold war is unlikely, but the age of unchallenged US hegemony in the Middle East could be ending.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-31T09:01:25Z", "title": "US hegemony in Middle East is ending | Chris Phillips", "sentences": ["Foreign Policy&apos;s Josh Landis, for example, suggests that unconditional US support for Israel will draw Moscow back into its pre-1989 role as supporter and arms supplier for the enemies of Tel Aviv and Washington."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/31/us-hegemony-middle-east-ending"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Turkey", "World news", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": "     At least 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed and dozens injured in a battle at sea with Israeli naval commandos today, sparking an international diplomatic crisis and the prospect of angry demonstrations across Israel, the Palestinian territories, Turkey and beyond. Dozens of activists injured during the storming of a Gaza aid flotilla were ferried to hospitals in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Ashkelon. The Israeli military said at least five of its personnel were also injured, at least one seriously. The incident engulfed Israel in a war of words with its ally Turkey, with whom relations were already stained following the Israelis three-week military assault on the Gaza Strip in 2008-9. Today&apos;s deaths and injuries were condemned by the UN, EU and other countries. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the storming of the flotilla as a &quot;massacre&quot;. The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, described it as a &quot;war crime&quot;. Turkey, Spain and Greece demanded explanations from the Israeli ambassadors to their countries. Turkish police were sent to the residence of the Israeli ambassador in Ankara, which was surrounded by demonstrators. Nine of the dead activists were thought to be Turkish nationals. Israel swiftly mounted a PR offensive to set out its version of events. The navy had promised to exercise restraint in dealing with the flotilla, and the bloodshed involved in the operation will inevitably leave Israel open to charges of excessive force. The assault began at 4.30am in international waters, about 60 miles from the coast of Gaza where the convoy was heading to deliver its cargo of aid. According to a spokeswoman for Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Avital Leibovich, officers aboard its warships gave the activists several warnings before boarding the Turkish ferry, the Mavi Marmara. &quot;We found ourselves in the middle of a lynching,&quot; she told reporters in the Israeli port of Ashdod. Around 10 activists attacked commandos, she said, relieving them of their pistols. &quot;We didn&apos;t look for confrontation but it was a massive attack,&quot; she said. &quot;What happened was a last resort.&quot; It was impossible to contact protesters on the ships, but the Free Gaza Movement, one of the organisers of the flotilla, said the IDF had started the violence, firing as soon as they boarded the ship. At least one of the six boats in the flotilla arrived at lunchtime in Ashdod, 23-miles north of Gaza City. The port was closed to reporters, who took up position on a hill overlooking it. Activists were expected to be processed in a large white tent on the quayside, where they would be offered the choice of immediate deportation to their country of origin or going through the lengthy process of the Israeli courts system. The Israeli authorities gave no details of the injuries suffered by activists. It confirmed that 10 were dead, although government sources suggested the figure could be as high as 19. It claimed that one of its injured troops had suffered gunshot wounds and another had been stabbed. Sheikh Raed Salah, the leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement, an influential organisation among Arab citizens of Israel, who was on board the Mavi Mamara, was also injured. There are conflicting reports as to the seriousness of his injuries. The Swedish author Henning Mankell was on board one of the ships, which left Cyprus yesterday and had been due to arrive in Gaza today. The flotilla, which had been delayed by several days, was carrying around 650 activists and 10,000 tonnes of aid, including medical supplies and construction materials. The aim was to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which has been rigorously enforced for the past three years. Leibovich defended Israel&apos;s action in international waters, saying it was permissible when a country&apos;s security was threatened. Israel was expected to advise its nationals in Turkey to leave the country for fear of reprisals. A luxury liner, Magic 1, was diverted from the Turkish coast to Cyprus. Abbas said: &quot;What Israel has committed on board the freedom flotilla was a massacre.&quot; He declared three days of official mourning for the dead. Israeli police cancelled leave and the army was on high alert, saying it feared possible rocket attacks from Islamist militants in Gaza and southern Lebanon. Israel&apos;s deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, described the activists as allies of Hamas and al-Qaida, claiming they would have opened an arms smuggling route to Gaza if they had been permitted to land there.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-31T09:26:00Z", "title": "Israeli commandos kill activists on flotilla bound for Gaza", "sentences": ["Dozens of activists injured during the storming of a Gaza aid flotilla were ferried to hospitals in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Ashkelon."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israel-kills-activists-flotilla-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "Protest", "Turkey", "World news", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": "Israel&apos;s calculated gamble in sending commandos to raid the Mediterranean flotilla looked likely last night to exact a high price, leaving it increasingly isolated internationally and diplomatically and losing the vital public relations war in the Middle East. The first and biggest casualty of what appeared to many as a rash act of night time derring-do was Israel&apos;s relationship with what used to be its key strategic, regional and Muslim ally, Turkey. Anger erupted on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, with Israeli flags burned and the Netanyahu government advising Israelis to stay away from Turkey. Thousands took to the streets and marched on the Israeli consulate. Turkey&apos;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, described the Israeli raid as &quot;an act of inhumane state terrorism&quot;, while the foreign ministry spoke of &quot;an act of piracy&quot; and of &quot;irreparable damage&quot; to relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv. Three of the six ships flew the Turkish flag, the convoy was organised by a Turkish charity, and several hundred of those on board the ships were Turks. &quot;We had a very good relationship with Israel, but we have had all kind of difficulties in the past,&quot; said a senior diplomat in Ankara, Selim Yenel. &quot;This tops them all.&quot; Protesters scaled the high fences protecting the Israeli consulate in Istanbul, only to be repelled by security forces. &quot;I cried all night. What Israel did was murder and terrorism,&quot; said Mehmet Tas, a computer software student. &quot;Turkey and Europe should unite and attack Israel.&quot; The fury on the streets was mirrored by high-level rage. Ankara recalled its ambassador from Israel. Erdogan rushed home from a trip to Latin America to deal with the fallout. Observers predicted a possible breach in diplomatic relations. &quot;Israel has targeted innocent civilians,&quot; said the foreign ministry in Ankara. &quot;It has shown yet again that it does not care about human lives or peace initiatives.&quot; Noting that the dawn raid occurred in international waters, Ankara hinted at demanding legal redress. The Turks convened an emergency meeting of generals and security ministers and called off military exercises with Israel, as did Greece. The United Nations security council was expected to meet last night in New York over the incident. &quot;I heard the ships were in international water. That is very bad,&quot; said Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general. The Obama administration, while regretting the death toll, reserved judgment on apportioning blame. &quot;The United States is currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy,&quot; said White House spokesman William Burton. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cancelled plans to visit Obama at the White House today. Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity, Israeli ambassadors were summoned in Stockholm, Madrid, and Athens, while Spain, holding the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, called a session of the EU&apos;s political and security committee. Foreign governments deplored the loss of life and voiced outrage at the Israeli conduct. But amid a propaganda war between the Israeli government press machine and pro-Palestinian lobbies over who started the fight and whether any of the activists on board were armed, they were also wary of going further than verbal condemnation. The common response in Europe was to condemn what was seen as Israel&apos;s disproportionate use of force. Even Germany, generally reluctant to criticize Israel because of the Holocaust, voiced horror at what Palestinian leaders dubbed a massacre. &quot;The German government is shocked by events in the international waters by Gaza,&quot; said a German government spokesman, adding that Israeli actions should observe the fundamental principle of proportionality. &quot;A first glance suggests this basic principle was not adhered to.&quot; Catherine Ashton, the EU&apos;s foreign and security policy chief, said: &quot;I have spoken to Israel&apos;s foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman to express our deepest concern about the tragedy that has happened. I said there should be an immediate inquiry by Israel into the circumstances.&quot; Her demand for an Israeli inquiry was echoed by European governments, but at odds with several other calls for an independent international investigation. Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, told Liberman that any investigation should be &quot;comprehensive, transparent, and neutral&quot;. While Israel generally prevents foreign politicians entering the Gaza Strip, Ashton was allowed in during her first trip to the Middle East in March. She called yesterday for a partial lifting of the blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt. &quot;I have also taken the opportunity to point out the importance of opening the crossings for humanitarian aid to go through, to ensure that ordinary people have a better existence than that which I saw.&quot; William Hague, the foreign secretary, said that the three-year Israeli siege of Gaza should be relaxed. &quot;I call on the government of Israel to open the crossings to allow unfettered access for aid to Gaza, and address the serious concerns about the deterioration in the humanitarian and economic situation and about the effect on a generation of young Palestinians.&quot; The Russian government meanwhile expressed its deep anxiety over the incident. It described the assault by Israeli commandos as a gross violation of international law and called for a thorough investigation. &quot;Use of weapons against civilians and detaining ships in the open sea without any legal reason constitute obvious and gross violations of generally accepted legal standards,&quot; Russia&apos;s foreign ministry said in a statement. It called for the &quot;earliest possible lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza&quot;. Tony Blair, envoy in the Middle East for the UN, US, EU, and Russia quartet, said: &quot;We need a different and better way of helping the people of Gaza and avoiding the hardship and tragedy that is inherent in the present situation.&quot; All the evidence suggests that Israel is calculating that it can brazen out the chorus of criticism and limit the substantive damage to its relations with Turkey.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-01T03:00:02Z", "title": "Gaza flotilla attack: world unites in condemnation of Israel's actions", "sentences": ["Turkey&apos;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, described the Israeli raid as &quot;an act of inhumane state terrorism&quot;, while the foreign ministry spoke of &quot;an act of piracy&quot; and of &quot;irreparable damage&quot; to relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/gaza-flotilla-attack-condemnation-israel"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Turkey", "Protest", "World news", "UK news", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": " 5.00pm:  That&apos;s it for today. Thanks for all the comments. Here&apos;s a round up.      \u2022 Released activists have said Israeli commandos opened fire before boarding Gaza flotilla. Turkish activist Nilufer Cetin said Israeli troops opened fire before boarding the Turkish-flagged ferry Mavi Marmara, which was the scene of the worst clashes and all the fatalities. Israeli officials have said that the use of armed force began when its boarding party was attacked. \u2022 Israel&apos;s military may have sabotaged two boats carrying Free Gaza activists after both malfuntioned at the same time in the same way prior to the raid. The ships were forced into port in Cyprus on Friday evening when both their steering systems broke down on the journey from Heraklion in Crete, a campaign spokeswoman said. \u2022 Egypt has temporarily lifted its blockade of the Gaza Strip to allow aid into the area. Several thousand Gazans are reportedly making a dash to the Egyptian border, hoping to take advantage of a rare chance to escape the blockaded territory. Cars with suitcases piled on their roofs are streaming to the border, while many others are lugging overstaffed bags on foot. Dozens of Hamas police with automatic weapons are patrolling the area to maintain order. \u2022 The MV Rachel Corrie, which was part of the Freedom Flotilla but had fallen behind, will still make for Gaza, according to the Free Gaza Movement. Spokeswoman Greta Berlin said the vessel would probably arrive next Monday or Tuesday. An unnamed Israeli marine lieutenant told Israel&apos;s Army Radio his unit was prepared to block the ship.  4.49pm:  There is speculation that two passenger boats in the Freedom Flotilla may have been sabotaged by the Israeli military. This is what a spokeswoman for the Free Gaza Movement said:  Two passenger boats sailing to Gaza as part of the aid flotilla attacked by Israel malfunctioned at the same time and in the same way earlier in their voyage, prompting suspicions they may have been sabotaged. Challenger I and Challenger II, carrying 36 activists from the Free Gaza campaign, were forced into port in Cyprus on Friday evening when both their steering systems broke down on the journey from Heraklion in Crete, a campaign spokeswoman said. The problems emerged as Israel&apos;s military establishment gave strong indications that clandestine attempts were made to sabotage some of the ships ahead of yesterday&apos;s bloody confrontation, in which at least nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed.  Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities have released this footage of some of the activists arriving at the port of Ashdod:             There has been some speculation that the man with white hair, 23 seconds in, may be the Swedish crime writer Henning Mankell, but the general view is that it&apos;s not him. We&apos;re told that the woman who can be seen at the 43-second mark is Ann Wright, a retired US army colonel who has become a prominent peace activist. 4.20pm:  Michael Tait, executive producer in the Guardian&apos;s multimedia department has alerted me to a Guardian video filmed on board the Spirit of Humanity as it sailed to Gaza last year.  The ship was carrying aid, building supplies and toys from Larnaca to Gaza on 30 June when Israeli gunships surrounded it in international waters and threatened to open fire. The film-maker Ismahil Blagrove captures the tense stand-off between the Israeli navy and the Free Gaza ship&apos;s captain and crew, which includes a Nobel peace prize winner and a former US congresswoman.  On Comment is Free there is a strong piece from Seth Freedman defending the Israeli action, while Daphna Baram takes opposite view. There is also an article from the archives by Ewa Jasiewicz of Free Gaza, who was on the ship. I&apos;ve been speaking to Jasiewicz&apos;s flatmate this afternoon, who has been (unsuccessfully) trying to contact her and says she holds a British passport.  3.53pm:       More reaction from those caught up in the flotilla violence. Tom Phillips is in Rio de Janeiro for the Guardian.  The Brazilian filmmaker Iara Lee, who was onboard the Mavi Marmara when it was stormed, claimed the Israeli troops had invaded the ship and &quot;started shooting at people.&quot; &quot;It was a surprise because it happened in the middle of the night, in the darkness, in international waters, because we knew there would be a confrontation but not in international waters,&quot; she told Brazil&apos;s TV Globo on Tuesday. &quot;Their first tactic was to cut all of our satellite communications and then they attacked,&quot; Lee said, reportedly speaking from an Israeli prison in the city of Beersheva, 80km from Jerusalem, where she was under arrest. &quot;All I witnessed first hand was the shooting,&quot; said New York-based Lee, who has also lived in Iran and Lebanon. &quot;They came onboard and started shooting at people.&quot; Lee, a former director of the Sao Paulo film festival and whose film Synthetic Pleasures was nominated for a Sundance award in 1996, said the operatives then sent the women to a lower level of the ship. &quot;They said we were terrorists \u2013 it was absurd. They came into the part where the women were, lots and lots of them, dressed in black and with gigantic weapons as if they were in a war.&quot; &quot;They confiscated all of our telephones and all of our luggage that was on the ship and took everything out of the bags and put it on the floor.&quot; Lee said she planned to return to Brazil and then to the US where she would continue her activism. &quot;Justice will not come quickly, we will have to continue working,&quot; she said.   3.41pm:  The civil society organisation Avaaz has set up a petition calling for a full investigation into the flotilla incident and an end to the Gaza blockade. The petition will be delivered to the UN and world leaders when it reaches 200,000 signatures, according to Avaaz. &quot;We call for an immediate, independent investigation into the flotilla assault, full accountability for those responsible, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade,&quot; the organisation says. The petition has attracted 14,000 signatures in the last couple of hours and is growing fast. You can view and sign it here.  3.25pm:  Israel killed five Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, three in an air strike after a rocket attack on Israel and two in a separate ground confrontation, Palestinian rescue workers told Reuters. The Israeli army confirmed its aircraft had fired at militants in Gaza, and that two gunmen were killed after breaching Israel&apos;s border fence with the coastal territory, but it had no further comment on the air raid. A spokesman for the militant Popular Resistance Committees said three of the group&apos;s members had been killed in an Israeli air strike over the northern Gaza Strip, one of them a field commander.  3.07pm:  The Israeli military has confirmed that it carried out an airstrike in Gaza today after rockets were fired into southern Israel. An Iranian-backed militant group, the Islamic Jihad, said three of its members were killed in the strike.  2.53pm:  Three people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a Palestinian medical official tells the Associated Press.  2.31pm:  Some of the people onboard the MV Rachel Corrie ship, which was part of the Freedom Flotilla but was not seized by Israeli troops after falling behind others in the fleet, have been named. Gaza campaigner Ali Abunimah has named 11 of the passengers on his blog:  \u2022 Mairead Maguire, the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, from Belfast, Ireland \u2022 Denis Halliday, Manhattan, NYC and Connemara, Ireland. \u2022 Matthias Chang Wen Chieh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2022 MP Mohd Nizar bin Zakaria, a member of the Malaysian Parliament. \u2022 Shamsul Akmar bin Musa Kamal 46, Selangor, Malaysia \u2022 Mr. Shamsul Akmar bin Musa Kamal, Malaysian journalist \u2022 Mohd Nizar bin Zakaria 41 , Perak, Malaysia \u2022 Abdul Halim Bin Mohamed 29 , Selangor, Malaysia \u2022 Abdul Halim, broadcast journalist for news and current affairs Malaysia TV3 \u2022 Mohd Jufri Bin Mohd Judin 33, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2022 Mohd Jufri, cameraman for news and current affairs Malaysia TV3.  While the Press Association is reporting that there are five Irish people in total aboard the MV Rachel Corrie, also including Fiona Thompson, a film-maker from Dundalk. The ship will still head for Gaza according to the Free Gaza Movement. &quot;We are an initiative to break Israel&apos;s blockade of 1.5 million people in Gaza. Our mission has not changed and this is not going to be the last flotilla,&quot; Free Gaza Movement activist Greta Berlin, based in Cyprus, told Reuters. However an unnamed Israeli marine lieutenant told Israel&apos;s Army Radio today his unit was prepared to block the ship.  &quot;We as a unit are studying, and we will carry out professional investigations to reach conclusions,&quot; the lieutenant said. &quot;And we will also be ready for the Rachel Corrie.&quot; The Army Radio station reported that the ship would reach Gazan waters tomorrow, however Berlin said it might not attempt to reach Gaza until early next week. &quot;We will probably not send her till [next] Monday or Tuesday,&quot; she said of the 1,200 tonne cargo ship. If you&apos;re in contact with anyone onboard, please get in touch: adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or @adamgabbatt  2.15pm:  Turkey&apos;s Foreign Ministry says four Turkish citizens have been confirmed dead on the Mavi Marmara, while another five of the dead are also believed to be Turks.  Israeli authorities say they are still trying to confirm the nationalities of the dead. More as we get it.  2.06pm:  Reuters is snapping the following sentence: &quot;UN chief Ban Ki-Moon says if Israel had heeded calls to lift Gaza blockade flotilla incident would not have happened&quot; I&apos;m guessing this means there is a statement coming from Ban. More to follow.  1.45pm:  The Israeli Defence Force has released a new video of an interview with one of the commandos who descended on the Mavi Marmara. &quot;It was a lynch,&quot; says the unnamed soldier. &quot;Every guy that came down the ropes was taken aside, and everyone there had metal rods, knives, slingshots, glass bottles.&quot;            Yesterday the IDF released footage it said showed soldiers being attacked on board the Mavi Marmara Activists have denied the claim.  1.25pm:       From the Guardian&apos;s Middle East editor, Ian Black, on Egypt opening the Rafah border crossing to the Gaza strip:  In one of the first signs of fallout from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla incident Egypt has announced that it is opening the the southern border of the Gaza Strip at Rafah to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.  The crossing normally opens once a month for a few days. The sudden decision seems to show Egyptian embarrassment at Arab charges of complicity with the the Israeli blockade.  President Hosni Mubarak is deeply hostile to Hamas, which has close links to the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt&apos;s largest \u2013 and semi-outlawed \u2013 opposition group.   1.14pm:  Matthew Weaver emails with a summary of the day so far:      \u2022 The UN has called for an independent inquiry into the raid, but its compromise statement on the incident stops short of an outright condemnation.\u2022 The Free Gaza Movement has sent more aid ships to the blockaded area despite warnings that they will be stopped by the Israeli military. \u2022 The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, warned Israel not to test Turkey&apos;s patience. He called for Israel to be &quot;punished&quot; for the attack.\u2022 More eyewitness accounts are emerging of what happened. Haneen Zuabi, a member of the Israeli Knesset who was on the Mavi Marmara, accused Israel of trying to &quot;cause the largest number of fatalities&quot; and said she did not hear any warning. \u2022 The Foreign Office has confirmed that a British man was among the injured  \u2022 Israel has continued to insist that is troops were acting in self defence after they were attacked by activists.  1.07pm:  Channel 4 News has named a British man injured in the clashes.   The FCO confirmed to Channel 4 News that one Briton has been injured. He has been named as Ahsan Shamruk. He is believed to be in a stable condition as is being treated in hospital. Shamruk&apos;s Facebook page reveals him to be actively involved in the Palestinian cause.

He was a member of the Viva Palistina group, a UK registered charity founded by controversial former MP George Galloway. The group campaigns for the rights of Palestinians and aims to get humanitarian supplies out to the Gaza strip.   1.01pm:  Muslim News has published an (unconfirmed) list of British citizens it says were in the Gaza flotilla:  Laura Macdonald Stuart Ebrahim Musaji Jamal Sayed Parveen Yaqub Baboo Adem Zanghar Ahsan Shamruk Mustafa Cengiz Ahmet Tauqir Sharif Boudejma BounouaMohammad Bounoua Sakir Yildirim Kenneth O&apos;Keefe Ali El-Awaisi Mohammed Bhaiyat Lort Phillips Alexandra Mary Sarah Nancy Colborne Ismail Adam Patel Nader Daher Mahi Mohammed AbidNur-E-Azom Choudhury Kevin OvendenPeter Venner Clifford Gardner Hanley Muzzammil Layth Chogley Jamaluddin Mohammad Farid Elshayyal Hassan Al Banna Ghani Lazrag Salah Ali Altan &quot;Consular staff are urgently seeking access to British nationals,&quot; a Foreign Office spokeswoman said, however she was unable to verify Muslim News&apos;s list. Are you in contact with any of the Britons? If so email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or tweet @adamgabbatt  12.43pm:  A closer look at the UN security council statement reveals that it stopped short of condemning Israel for the attack, saying instead that condemned &quot;those acts which resulted in the loss of at least 10 civilians&quot;.  We have updated our story to reflect this.  Here is the full text of the security council&apos;s statement.  12.23pm:  Haneen Zuabi, an Israeli-Arab MP in the Knessett who was on the Mavi Marmara, has accused her country of trying to &quot;cause the largest number of fatalities&quot;. She was released today after questioning and has been giving her version of events at a news conference, according to the Israeli news website ynetnews.com she told a conference.   &quot;I entered the captain&apos;s room. He was asked to stop by the Israeli soldiers. He said, &apos;We are a Turkish ship.&apos; We were 130 miles off. It was 11:30 pm. We saw four Israel vessels, they were at a distance because we were in international waters. At 4:15 am we saw the ships approaching. &quot;They were dinghies and choppers. At 4:30 am the forces landed quickly. I did not hear any warning from the ships, because noise was coming from the ships and the choppers. Within 10 minutes there were already three bodies. The entire operation took about an hour.&quot; &quot;There was not a single passenger who raised a club. We put on our life vests. There were no clubs or anything of the sort. There were gunshots, I don&apos;t know if they were live bullets or not. There were gunshots fired from the ships in our direction. &quot;A clear message was being sent to us, for us to know that our lives were in danger. We convened that we were not interested in a confrontation. What we saw was five bodies. There were only civilians and there were no weapons. There was a sense that I many not come out of it alive. Israel spoke of a provocation, but there was no provocation.&quot;   12.18pm:  My colleague Rob Booth emails with further confirmation of our Jerusalem correspondent Harriet Sherwood&apos;s report (see 10.33am) on the Briton injured on the flotilla.  One British activist was injured in the fighting, the Foreign Office has confirmed. It said its consular team is heading to Beersheeva and is &quot;urgently seeking information on other British nationals&quot;. There are thought to be around 40 British campaigners caught up in the crisis. At around 11am GMT lawyers for the campaigners were granted access to some of those imprisoned in Beersheva, according to Dr Arafat Mahdi, a UK based organiser of the flotilla.   12.10pm:  David Gaughran has sent me a link to this video from the Live Leak website, which he says shows Israelis chanting outside the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel.       .  12.05pm:  Reuters has more from activists arriving at Athens airport \u2013 this is from Mihalis Grigoropoulos, who was steering one of the ships in the flotilla:  &quot;They (Israelis) came down from helicopters and threw ropes from inflatable boats, climbing aboard. There was teargas and live ammunition. &quot;I was steering the ship, we saw them capture another ship in front of us, which was the Turkish passenger vessel with more than 500 people on board and heard shots fired. &quot;We did not resist at all, we couldn&apos;t even if we had wanted to. What could we have done against the commandos who climbed aboard? The only thing some people tried was to delay them from getting to the bridge, forming a human shield. They were fired upon with plastic bullets and were stunned with electric devices. &quot;There was great mistreatment after our arrest. We were essentially hostages, like animals on the ground. &quot;They wouldn&apos;t let us use the bathroom, wouldn&apos;t give us food or water and they took video of us despite international conventions banning this.&quot;   11.54am:  Matthew Weaver writes:     Matthew Weaver Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/guardian.co.uk    The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has delivered a furious speech to the Turkish parliament in Ankara. &quot;This attack should definitely be punished,&quot; he said to loud applause. &quot;No one should test Turkey&apos;s patience... The foundation of peace in the Middle East is being rocked by the reckless attitude of Israel,&quot; he said. &quot;This bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse,&quot; he added. He also revealed that Turkey had sent two ambulance flights to Israel to pick up Turks wounded in the raid, and that another flight is on the way. He called for the immediate release of the injured and those who continued to be detained. The speech was given a standing ovation.  11.38am:  The news agency Reuters are running accounts of some of the activists in the flotilla.Nilufer Cetin was travelling with her young son when the Israelli commandos boarded her ship.  &quot;We stayed in our cabin and played games amid the sound of gunfire. My son has been nervous since yesterday afternoon ... I did not need to protect my son. They knew there was a baby on board. I protected him by staying in my cabin, then went to the bathroom. I put a gas mask and life jacket on my son. We did not experience any other problems onboard, only a water shortage. We took walks on the deck, played games with my son. The curtains were drawn, so I did not see not the raid as it was happening. I only heard the voices. There are lightly and heavily wounded people. &quot;There are thousands, millions of babies in Gaza. My son and I wanted to play with those babies. We planned to deliver them aid. We wanted to say &apos;Look, it&apos;s a safe place, I came here with my baby-son&apos;. I saw my husband from a distance, he looked OK. The ship personnel was not wounded, because they (the soldiers) needed them to take the ship toport. I will go again if another ship goes.&quot;   11.15am:  The Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement is reporting that a US activist injured in protests in the West Bank yesterday has lost her eye.  An American solidarity activist was shot in the face with a tear gas canister during a demonstration in Qalandiya, today. Emily Henochowicz is currently in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem undergoing surgery to remove her left eye, following the demonstration that was held in protest to Israel&apos;s murder of at least 10 civilians aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in international waters this morning. 21-year old Emily Henochowicz was hit in the face with a tear gas projectile fired directly at her by an Israeli soldier during the demonstration at Qalandiya checkpoint today. Israeli occupation forces fired volleys of tear gas at unarmed Palestinian and international protesters, causing mass panic amongst the demonstrators and those queuing at the largest checkpoint separating the West Bank and Israel.   This YouTube video, posted by RussiaToday, appears to show Emily being carried to safety following a protest in Qalandiya. The images are quite distressing.            Emily&apos;s blog says she is a student at Cooper Union university in New York.  10.50am:  Harriet Sherwood is tweeting from Ashdod:      @harrietsherwood Activists in prison to be brought before judge and deported within 72 hours, says army radio #flotilla @harrietsherwood 48 have already been deported #flotilla  10.33am:  At least one Briton was injured in the Israeli assault on the flotilla and has been hospitalised, according to the British embassy in Tel Aviv. Harriet Sherwood, the Guardian&apos;s Jerusalem correspondent, reports that the man is not in a serious condition but is understood to have bruising and injuries requiring suturing. The embassy, which has has been allowed access to the activist, said it could not release any further identifying information. Embassy spokeswoman Karen Kaufman said she believed the Briton had been on board the Marvi Marmara, the Turkish passenger ship on which at least 10 activists were killed in a off-shore battle with Israeli commandos yesterday.  More to follow  10.26am:  The South African news website Independent Online is reporting that a South African journalist covering the flotilla for community radio station Radio 786 in Cape Town caught up in the clashes is alive.  South African journalist Gadijah Davids, who was caught up in a clash between the Israeli Defence Force and an aid ship bound for Gaza, is alive, her relieved mother Magboeba said on Tuesday. &quot;The mere fact that she is alive is quite consoling for us,&quot; Davids said. The department of international relations told the family that she had been found, and they were currently working on finding out more about the conditions that she was being held under. Davids said she had known the possibilities when she left.   10.19am:  The Guardian&apos;s Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell emails:     Severin Carrell. Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian    Carl Abernethy, a spokesman for the Free Gaza campaign group in Scotland, told The Guardian there was evidence two of their campaigners \u2013 Theresa McDermott, 43, from Edinburgh and Alex Harrison, 32, from London \u2013 may have been on board a vessel which had not been impounded by the Israelis, the MV Rachel Corrie. Named after the US activist killed by Israeli security forces in Gaza in 2003, the Irish-registered vessel is still at sea and is planning to break the blockade in several days, Abernethy said. Emails he received overnight showed that both McDermott, who was feared to have been arrested yesterday, and Harrison were on the original passenger list for the Rachel Corrie, which set sail from Dundalk several weeks ago. However, those passenger lists were amended and &quot;a bit confusing&quot;, and it was unclear who had actually boarded the vessel and set sail, Abernethy said. He had not yet had confirmation that McDermott and Harrison were at liberty. &quot;The Rachel Corrie wasn&apos;t apprehended and they&apos;re still at sea; the intention remains still to get to Gaza over the next couple of days. They&apos;re going in the hope the Israelis won&apos;t want a repeat of what happened yesterday,&quot; he said. The vessel is carrying cement, wheelchairs and crutches, school supplies and sports equipment, nearly 18tn of printing paper, photocopiers, 52tns of medical equipment, dentistry equipment, shoes and clothing for schools, medical facilities and refugee camps on the strip.  10.11am:  Matthew Weaver has been speaking to the relative of one of the people in the fleet.  &quot;It&apos;s incredibly worrying&quot; says Abdul Rahman Elshayyal as he waits for news about his brother Jamal Elshayyal, a 25-year-old producer with Al Jazeera. Jamal sent this report during the raid, before communications were cut. Abdul Rahman said the video was &quot;reassuring up to a point, up to the point that you&apos;ve watched the same video about 100 times over and over again. But then you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening afterwards.&quot; He adds: &quot;I&apos;m hoping and praying that he&apos;s OK and that journalists will still be treated as well as they should be in situations like this.&quot;   10.05am:  Israel&apos;s ambassador to the UK, Ron Prosor, told BBC Radio 4 this morning the storming of the aid flotilla had not been a success. &quot;It&apos;s obvious - and I won&apos;t beat around the bush on this - that this wasn&apos;t successful and I think it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently,&quot; he told the Today programme. &quot;But they were also, on the other side, really trying to do everything in order to provoke and confront and those militant elements rendered something which was supposed to be a humanitarian issue way out of proportion. &quot;So I think, yes, we take a lot of things back with us and we check that as we do. As you know, Israel is a vibrant democracy and the discussions are already beginning in Jerusalem.&quot;  9.55am:  The activist Shane Dillon, who was seized from the flotilla yesterday, will be sent back to Ireland today, Press Association is reporting. Six other Irish campaigners - including Dr Fintan Lane and Fiachra O Luain - are being detained in the Be&apos;er Sheva detention camp, where they also face deportation. There has been no word yet on Caoimhe Butterly (see 9.13am). Dillon, Lane and O Luain were on board Free Gaza boat Challenger 1 which was boarded by Israeli forces in international waters as it travelled from Cyprus. Nobel peace prizewinner Mairead Maguire remains on board the Irish-owned vessel MV Rachel Corrie. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin, who maintains that the Irish citizens were kidnapped, confirmed the Irish ambassador in Tel Aviv was given permission to meet Dillon at Ben Gurion Airport before his departure. The ambassador and officers from the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv are due to visit the detained Irish citizens during today. &quot;I will continue to press for full consular access being allowed, as is provided for under international law,&quot; said Martin. &quot;I will be reporting to the Government later this morning on my meeting yesterday with the Israeli ambassador and on the measures which my department is taking to secure the immediate and unconditional release of those Irish citizens detained by Israel.&quot;  9.39am:  More from Matthew Weaver:     Matthew Weaver Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/guardian.co.uk    Two Australian journalists, Paul McGeough and Kate Geraghty, are still believed to be in an Israeli prison following their arrest as they reported on the raid, according to their paper the Sydney Morning Herald.  9.33am:  As well as providing the latest updates, we&apos;d like to hear from you.  Do you have friends or relatives on board? Were you involved in the Freedom Flotilla yourself? Have you seen any video, news or opinion you think we should be including in the blog? Get in touch on Twitter @adamgabbatt, email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or comment below.  9.13am:  My colleague Matthew Weaver has this:  &quot;The Irish activist Caoimhe Butterly, who was on the flotilla, recorded this message to YouTube before boarding the boat. &apos;If you are watching this, this probably means that the flotilla has been either been attacked or stopped at sea,&apos; she begins.&quot;              .  9.08am:  Here&apos;s the Downing Street statement on David Cameron&apos;s conversation with Binyamin Netanyahu:      The PM spoke tonight to Israeli PM Netanyahu. The PM deplored the heavy loss of life off the coast of Gaza earlier today. He reiterated the UK&apos;s strong commitment to Israel&apos;s security, but urged Israel to respond constructively to legitimate criticism of its actions, and to do everything possible to avoid a repeat of this unacceptable situation. The PM also stressed the importance of urgently lifting the blockade of Gaza, and allowing full access for humanitarian aid.  8.59am:  Associated Press news agency is reporting that two people have been killed after crossing the border from Gaza into Israel.  The Israeli military says Gaza militants crossed the border and exchanged fire with troops. Israeli rescue services say two militants were killed. Commandos boarding one of the ships Monday encountered resistance and killed nine pro-Palestinian activists in the ensuing clash. The Israeli military says no troops were hurt in Tuesday&apos;s clash on the Gaza border. Israeli police said roadblocks were thrown up inside Israel after the reported infiltration from Gaza. Israel Radio reported that schoolchildren in the area were ordered to remain inside.   8.45am:  The UN security council has formally condemned Israel&apos;s botched assault on the flotilla carrying aid supplies to the Gaza Strip and called for an impartial investigation into the incident. At least nine people were killed in the raid yesterday as Israeli naval commandos stormed the Mavi Marmara, the largest ship in the flotilla carrying passengers. Dozens more were wounded and taken to Israeli hospitals. It sparked a wave of global condemnation and protests. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, expressed his shock at the military interception on the Gaza bound &quot;Freedom Flotilla&quot;, which was carrying relief supplies to Gaza. &quot;I condemn this violence,&quot; Ban said from Kampala, Uganda, where he was presiding over the first review conference of the International Criminal Court (ICC). &quot;It is vital that there is a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe Israel must urgently provide a full explanation.&quot;  Organisers of the flotilla said today they are sending two more ships to the area within the next few days. Greta Berlin of the Free Gaza Movement said a cargo boat is already on the way to challenge Israel&apos;s blockade of Gaza and a second boat carrying about three dozen passengers is expected to join it.

A consular official was en route to Be&apos;er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert, where the embassy believed a number of Britons were being held. &quot;We&apos;re not sure where all of them are, although we believe several are in Be&apos;er Sheva,&quot; Kaufman told the Guardian. &quot;As soon as they identify themselves as British nationals, the Israeli foreign ministry is informing the embassy.&quot; She suggested that some detained activists may not be co-operating with the Israeli authorities, thus not revealing their nationality.

The spokesman, Anders Joerle, said that Mankell was still considering whether he should be deported, which would mean being put on a plane at Ben Gurion airport and flown back to Stockholm, or face trial in Israel. &quot;I believe that Henning Mankell is now being held in custody,&quot; said Joerle. A spokesman for Mankell, whose novels about the police commissar Kurt Wallander have sold over 25m copies worldwide, said he could not confirm the reports but had received news that \u2013 contrary to initial accounts that the writer had been injured \u2013 the Swede was safe and unhurt. &quot;A lot of people are saying a lot of things, which are second and third hand,&quot; said Robert Johnson. &quot;All I can say is, although I haven&apos;t heard directly from Henning himself, I can confirm he is safe and he hasn&apos;t been hurt.&quot; Mankell is one of around 10 Swedish activists who were on board the Swedish ship, the Sofia. One of them is believed to have been injured, though not seriously, according to the foreign ministry. The Stockholm radio station SR reported that four of the Swedes had decided to be put on trial rather than be deported and were now being held in the Beersheva prison in the Negev desert, along with around 480 other international activists. It reported that Mankell, 62, was not among them, as he had not yet decided what action to take and was therefore still being held in custody in the port city of Ashdod. Two other Swedes who were on board the ship have not been accounted for. The German foreign ministry confirmed that six of a known 11 German citizens who were part of the flotilla were still missing. Five activists, among them two politicians from the Links (left) party, Annette Groth and Inge H\u00f6ger, and a former member of the party, Norman Paech, returned to Berlin this morning. Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said he was relieved that five of the activists were home, but demanded &quot;immediate consulate access&quot; to the other six. He said the German embassy in Tel Aviv was trying to gather information on them. At a press conference in Berlin this morning, Paech, 72, gave a vivid account of his experience, describing how he was awakened when Israeli soldiers stormed the Mavi Marmara ship he was on. &quot;When they started with their aggression I was still asleep in the saloon, but suddenly I heard absolutely striking explosions,&quot; he said. &quot;I hurried up and dressed myself and colleagues said to me &apos;We&apos;re under attack, the Israelis are here&apos;. The aggression came from the sky, from helicopters from which soldiers came down by ropes. We waited in the fore room and saw them carrying an Israeli soldier who looked to me like he&apos;d had a breakdown. Then the second and third came, but after these three injured soldiers then I saw a lot \u2013 maybe 10 \u2013 passengers who were severely hurt, injured, covered in blood. They were treated in the saloon next to me. One was so badly injured I am sure he must have died soon after. I didn&apos;t even consider going upstairs as it was just too dangerous.&quot; He said the majority of the injured had been international activists. &quot;It was terrifying ... it was a shock and awe strategy that they&apos;d clearly been planning for a long time.&quot; Responding to the claims that the activists were armed, Paech, who was wrapped in an El Al airlines blanket, said: &quot;I saw no arms whatsoever. There were only two men with short sticks, but no knives, iron rods, pistols or any real weapons. Throughout our planning of the mission we said: &apos;No arms, no explosives&apos;, we said we&apos;d only resist politically, with normal means.&quot; He said ships other than the Mavi Marmara had not been nearly as badly affected, and their passengers had on the whole surrendered. But he said he was concerned for the whereabouts of an Australian camera team. Six Italian citizens were also among the European activists on board the ships, and all of them were today believed to be being held in Israeli custody.

Arriving at Istanbul&apos;s Ataturk airport with her one-year-old baby, Turkish activist Nilufer Cetin said Israeli troops opened fire before boarding the Turkish-flagged ferry Mavi Marmara, which was the scene of the worst clashes and all the fatalities. Israeli officials have said that the use of armed force began when its boarding party was attacked. &quot;It was extremely bad and very tough clashes took place. The Mavi Marmara is filled with blood,&quot; said Cetin, whose husband is the Mavi Marmara&apos;s chief engineer. She told reporters that she and her child hid in the bathroom of their cabin during the confrontation. &quot;The operation started immediately with firing. First it was warning shots, but when the Mavi Marmara wouldn&apos;t stop these warnings turned into an attack,&quot; she said. &quot;There were sound and smoke bombs and later they used gas bombs. Following the bombings they started to come on board from helicopters.&quot; Cetin is among a handful of Turkish activists to be released; more than 300 remain in Israeli custody. She said she agreed to extradition from Israel after she was warned that conditions in jail would be too harsh for her child. &quot;I am one of the first passengers to be sent home, just because I have baby. When we arrived at the Israeli port of Ashdod we were met by the Israeli interior and foreign ministry officials and police; there were no soldiers. They asked me only a few questions. But they took everything \u2013 cameras, laptops, cellphones, personal belongings including our clothes,&quot; she said. Kutlu Tiryaki was a captain of another vessel in the flotilla. &quot;We continuously told them we did not have weapons, we came here to bring humanitarian help and not to fight,&quot; he said. &quot;The attack on the Mavi Marmara came in an instant: they attacked it with 12 or 13 attack boats and also with commandos from helicopters. We heard the gunshots over our portable radio handsets, which we used to communicate with the Mavi Marmara, because our ship communication system was disrupted. There were three or four helicopters also used in the attack. We were told by Mavi Marmara their crew and civilians were being shot at and windows and doors were being broken by Israelis.&quot; Six Greek activists who returned to Athens accused Israeli commandos of using electric shocks during the raid. Dimitris Gielalis, who had been aboard the Sfendoni, told reporters: &quot;Suddenly from everywhere we saw inflatables coming at us, and within seconds fully equipped commandos came up on the boat. They came up and used plastic bullets, we had beatings, we had electric shocks, any method we can think of, they used.&quot; Michalis Grigoropoulos, who was at the wheel of the Free Mediterranean, said: &quot;We were in international waters. The Israelis acted like pirates, completely out of the normal way that they conduct nautical exercises, and seized our ship. They took us hostage, pointing guns at our heads; they descended from helicopters and fired tear gas and bullets. There was absolutely nothing we could do \u2026 Those who tried to resist forming a human ring on the bridge were given electric shocks.&quot; Grigoropoulos, who insisted the ship was full of humanitarian aid bound for Gaza &quot;and nothing more&quot;, said that, once detained, the human rights activists were not allowed to contact a lawyer or the Greek embassy in Tel Aviv. &quot;They didn&apos;t let us go to the toilet, eat or drink water and throughout they videoed us.

A group of 124 pro-Palestinian activists from 12 Muslim nations crossed the border in five Jordanian buses. Another 200 activists have been transferred from a holding centre to Israel&apos;s airport near Tel Aviv, a prison service spokesman said. The remaining activists will be released throughout the day, the spokesman said. Yesterday Israel indicated it may prosecute some of the activists. The decision to free the detainees came as more accounts from those on the ships began to emerge. One Briton who was on one of the boats heading towards Gaza arrived back in Britain last night. IT professional Hasan Nowarah, from Glasgow, described the moment Israeli troops stormed the aid flotilla. He told Sky News the Mavi Marmara ship was surrounded by helicopters and Zodiac assault craft. &quot;All you could see was screaming and bullets. Out of the blue as I looked around our ship, all I could see were hundreds of Zodiacs: hundreds of Zodiacs full of soldiers, and big ships, lots of ships, and I believe as well submarines in the sea,&quot; he said. The assault left nine dead and dozens wounded, and has led to condemnation of Israel and increasing calls for an independent inquiry. One of the group deported to Jordan today, Walid al-Tabtabai, a Kuwaiti politician who was on board one of the ships with other activists from Muslim countries, said: &quot;The Israelis roughed up and humiliated all of us: women, men and children. &quot;They were brutal and arrogant, but our message reached every corner of the world, that the blockade on Gaza is unfair and should be lifted immediately.&quot; Like many passengers on the flotilla he insisted there were no weapons on any of the ships. An Algerian, Izzeddine Zahrour, said the Israeli authorities &quot;deprived us of food, water and sleep, and we weren&apos;t allowed to use the toilet&quot;. &quot;It was an ugly kidnapping, and subsequently bad treatment in Israeli jail,&quot; he said. &quot;They handcuffed us, pushed us around and humiliated us.&quot; Mauritanian Mohammed Gholam said Israel &quot;wanted us to sign documents saying that we entered Israel illegally&quot;. An Algerian activist, who giving only a first name of Sabrina, accused Israeli commandos of taking a one-year-old child hostage. &quot;They point a gun to his head in front of his Turkish parents to force the captain of our ship to stop sailing,&quot; she said. A Jordanian government spokesman said there were 30 Jordanians in the group. Jordan is one of two Arab nations with a signed peace treaty with Israel. The Kuwaiti ambassador, Sheik Faisal al-Sabah, said the group included 16 Kuwaitis. He said the other activists came from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Yemen, Oman and Bahrain. Turkey has led criticism of the raid, accusing Israel of committing a &quot;massacre&quot;, and the UN security council demanded an impartial investigation. There were reports in the Israeli media today that Israel had ordered the families of its diplomats in Turkey to leave that country because of Turkish anger at the raid. Washington blocked an attempt at the UN security council for an international inquiry yesterday, issuing a mild statement regretting the loss of life. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, later called the situation in Gaza &quot;unsustainable&quot;. &quot;Israel&apos;s legitimate security needs must be met, just as the Palestinians&apos; legitimate needs for sustained humanitarian assistance and regular access to reconstruction materials must also be assured,&quot; she said. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said this morning that Israel&apos;s blockade of Gaza was &quot;an absolute humanitarian catastrophe&quot; that was &quot;not in Israel&apos;s own long-term self-interest&quot;. He told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme this morning Israel had &quot;every right&quot; to protect its people from terrorist threat, but said: &quot;What I ask my Israeli friends and Israeli politicians and officials I meet is: what&apos;s the strategy; where do you go next; how are you going to secure in the long term \u2013 not just day to day \u2013 the security which you rightly crave?&quot; Last night, the foreign secretary, William Hague, said 31 British nationals and a further 11 with dual nationality were known to have been detained after the seizure of the vessels as they attempted to breach the Israeli blockade of the territory. The Foreign Office confirmed that 29 of the Britons had received a visit \u2013 with no complaints about their treatment. Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said the detainees were being treated in line with international practice. &quot;We are not charging them with anything. We have detained them and we will help them leave our country,&quot; he told the BBC. There was concern among friends and relatives in the UK, who complained that they were unable to establish contact with the detainees. Rachel Bridgeland, whose partner, Peter Venner, 63, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, was on the Mavi Marmara, said the government should be putting more pressure on Israel. &quot;It is absolutely terrible not knowing what has happened to him, and it&apos;s terrible that the British government hasn&apos;t done more, but they don&apos;t want to fall out with Israel,&quot; she said.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-02T08:15:00Z", "title": "Gaza flotilla activists deported to Jordan claim Israeli mistreatment", "sentences": ["Another 200 activists have been transferred from a holding centre to Israel&apos;s airport near Tel Aviv, a prison service spokesman said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/gaza-flotilla-activists-deported-jordan"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "World news", "Protest", "Gaza flotilla"], "article": " 2.15pm:       \u2022 Israel&apos;s attorney general says all of the nearly 700 activists detained in a deadly raid on an aid flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip will be deported by the end of the day.

Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Corrigan said today that those on board the MV Rachel Corrie would offer no resistance if Israeli commandos storm their boat over the next 24 hours. Speaking just after noon today from the vessel, Corrigan said their intention was to be in Gaza by Saturday afternoon. &quot;Everyone on board is acting in a peaceful manner and there would be no violence whatsoever,&quot; she said. The former Peace People founder from Belfast added: &quot;Our aim is to be in Port in Gaza by Saturday a we are now about 550 miles from the coast. We are here to break the siege of Gaza which is illegal under international law. All we want to do is deliver the humanitarian aid.&quot; So far, she said, the Israeli Navy or military authorities have not been in contact with the ship as it steers its course towards Gaza. Corrigan said she had experience before of being on an aid ship to Gaza that was then intercepted by Israeli forces. She pointed out that last year she spent a week in detention in Ashdod after another vessel she sailed on was taken over by the Israelis.  12.27pm: Last night the aid ship the MV Rachel Corrie was sailing towards Gaza now it heading back to Crete, reports Steph Oliver.     Steph Oliver byline. Photograph: guardian.co.uk    The Free Gaza Movement is holding a meeting tonight to determine whether the Rachel Corrie will continue on to Gaza tomorrow. The ship, one of only boats that was not seized by Israel, is currently on its way to Crete. It will port there for the night whilst a decision is made.  Free Gaza said is reluctant to send the ship because it does not want the vessel to attract all of the media attention when there are still activists who have not yet been released. This includes one of the Free Gaza board members, Lubna Masarwa.  If the Rachel Corrie does not depart tomorrow it is likely it will be another month before it can set sail again because of the time it will take to gather a new flotilla together, the charity said. Audrey Bosme, lawyer for the Free Gaza movement said they have been inundated with requests from people who want to join the ship.  She also added that all of the passengers on board, including Nobel peace prize winner, Mairead Maguire and former UN diplomat Denis Halliday were &apos;dying to go to Gaza&apos; and were &apos;willing to risk their lives&apos;.   12.07pm: The Israeli army has all but admitted that the activists did not have guns of their own before the raid. Army spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said two pistols were seized from activists but these had been taken from the troops raiding the boat. She claimed the magazines of both weapons had been emptied before they were seized back. Speaking to al Jazeera she insisted that the force used by the troops was proportionate. &quot;Any metal bar pointing at someone&apos;s head can kill,&quot; she said.  Asked to list weapons on board she said there were knives, scissors, night vision binoculars, many metal bars and sharp objects. She claimed they had been prepared in advance and added that throwing soldiers off the boat was not the actions of a humanitarian organisation.  11.50am: Is the Rafah crossing really open as Egypt announced yesterday? Jack Shenker, our man on the border, says there has been very little movement today.     Jack Shenker byline. Photograph: guardian.co.uk    The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza has a surreal feel to it on this baking hot afternoon - the border may be at the centre of a geopolitical storm but you wouldn&apos;t think it from watching the local farmers&apos; donkey carts trundling past or from the bored looking customs officials sipping tea inside the terminal. Acutely conscious of the need to appease domestic outrage at Israel&apos;s actions - and of the unpopularity fuelled by his own role in maintaining Israel&apos;s Gaza siege - Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak announced with a flourish yesterday that Rafah would now be open &apos;indefinitely&apos;.  But beyond the occasional busload of Gazans looking to return home (most of them are the relatives of Gazans receiving medical treatment in Cairo) the Rafah terminal remains pretty quiet. With limited traffic - human and cargo - going into Gaza, and no traffic whatsoever visibly coming out, it&apos;s hard to see how this sleepy door between the two nations could be classified as &apos;open&apos;. There are conflicting rumours about why there is so little movement in and out, with some blaming Hamas border guards and others claiming Egyptian officials are causing the delay.  Most people I&apos;ve spoken to here are intensely pessimistic that this &apos;opening&apos; will prove to be meaningful or permanent. One UN official told me it was merely an act of political propaganda on the part of the Egyptian regime. Those Gazans who are working their way back home from Egypt are making the most of their brief escape from Israel&apos;s economic blockade: trolleys are piled high with TVs, bicycles and mattresses, with a few fridges thrown in for good measure as well.  11.38am: Huwaida Arraf, one of the Free Gaza Movement organisers, claimed she was beaten when Israeli troops boarded her ship. She told CNN:      &quot;They started coming after our ship so we took off and they charged us also. Eventually, they overtook our ship and they used concussion grenades, sound bombs and pellets.&quot; They started beating people. My head was smashed against the ground and they stepped on my head. They later cuffed me and put a bag over my head. They did that to everybody.&quot;  11.25am: The Israeli foreign ministry has turned to the photo-sharing site Flickr to publish images of what it claims were the &quot;weapons&quot; found on board the Mavi Marmara. They include an angle grinder, that the ministry says was used to saw off metal railings used to hit soldiers who boarded the ship.  11.17am: Turkey&apos;s foreign minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, says Turkey will review its ties with Israel if it fails to release all the Turkish detainees today. But speaking at a press conference, which is still going on, he added &quot;it is time calm replaces anger&quot;.  11.05am: ITN has posted this footage to YouTube of freed activists being deported to Jordan. Many gave victory signs to the waiting media as they arrived in buses.             10.52am:             Another video has emerged of reporters broadcasting in several languages from the Mavi Marmara as the raid was taking place. Towards the end of the clip one of the reporters said that two Israeli soldiers had been captured.  10.47am:       Jack Shenker, Guardian correspondent in Egypt, is tweeting from the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, which was opened by the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak yesterday. He&apos;s been told by a UN official that the opening of the border will be temporary: &quot;Mubarak has only done this for short-term political propaganda&quot;. Here are some of Jack&apos;s recent posts. @hackneylad @hackneylad Been at Rafah border since 9am and the crossing is largely quiet. Some Gazans travelling back home with goods but none so far the other way  @hackneylad No journalists here except us all morning, but some arriving now. Police are being tetchy about media coverage but haven&apos;t stopped us yet.  @hackneylad Meeting families laden with TVs, fridges, medical supplies - some have been waiting weeks to return home.  @hackneylad Still no visible traffic the other way though. To call this crossing &apos;open&apos; would be a bit of a stretch of the imagination at present.  10.37am:  The New York Times reports on the battle of the videos from both sides of the confrontation on flotilla.  &quot;When Israeli commandos attacked the so-called Freedom Flotilla, both sides were well armed \u2014 with video cameras \u2014 and both sides have released a blizzard of video clips as evidence that the other side was the aggressor in the conflict on Monday, which left nine activists dead The flotilla videos have proved a popular draw online, with one from the Israel Defense Forces attracting more than 600,000 views on YouTube. Scenes from both perspectives have been shown in a continuous loop on television news programs all over the world, stirring public outrage. But what is missing so far from the flotilla clips on both sides is context: it is difficult to establish the sequence of events or, more simply, to determine who attacked first. The videos have made it all the more murky.&quot;   10.31am:  Our Jerusalem correspondent Harriet Sherwood has sent the following Israeli opinion poll conducted by TNS/Telesker.  The poll questioned a representative sample of the Jewish population over age 18. No margin of error is given. The poll shows almost two-thirds think the flotilla should have been stopped using alternative means. Here are some questions from the poll. Q: One year following the establishment of the government, how satisfied are you with Netanyahu&apos;s performance? Extremely satisfied \u2014 8.4% Fairly satisfied \u2014 33.4% Not so satisfied \u2014 32.7% Not at all satisfied \u2014 24.1% Q: How satisfied are you with Barak&apos;s performance? Extremely satisfied \u2014 9.2% Fairly satisfied \u2014 30.2% Not so satisfied \u2014 36.8% Not at all satisfied \u2014 22.9% Q: Should the flotilla have been stopped using a different method? The mission should have been carried out as it was \u2014 31.7% The flotilla should have been stopped using an alternative method \u2014 62.7% Don&apos;t know/do not have a position \u2014 5.6% Q: Among the following organizations, which do you believe was responsible for the mission&apos;s outcome? The military \u2014 20.8% The defense minister \u2014 43.4% The prime minister \u2014 16.1% Don&apos;t know/do not have a position \u2014 8.4% Q: Should Israel form a commission of inquiry to examine the mission&apos;s failures? Yes \u2014 46.7% No \u2014 51.6% Don&apos;t know/do not have a position \u2014 1.7% Q: Should Netanyahu resign due to these failures?

Yes \u2014 20.9% No \u2014 74.8% Don&apos;t know/do not have a position \u2014 4.2%  10.10am:  Sherine Tadros, a reporter for al-Jazeera, is providing Twitter updates from outside Be&apos;er Sheva prison on the release of the detainees. Here&apos;s a selection from the last three hours:      @SherineT Just saw two big buses on highway from beersheva to Tel Aviv that looked like they were carrying activists. @SherineT 2 more buses of flotilla activists just left beersheva prison minutes ago.not sure how many people left inside.all will be deported @SherineT 70 people left inside prison. They are due out any moment. I can see them now! @SherineT 186 flotilla activists still detained.they are meeting with lawyers and consuls inside prison now. @SherineT Another 77 activists to leave prison v soon. No more women will be left inside,around 100male activists left in detention.  9.56am:  \u2022 A group of 124 pro-Palestinian activists from 12 Muslim nations has crossed the Israeli border in five Jordanian buses. Another 200 activists have been transferred from a holding centre to Israel&apos;s airport near Tel Aviv. \u2022 Yesterday Israel had indicated it might prosecute some of the activists, but an Israeli spokesman has said that all remaining detainees will be released throughout the day. \u2022 Last night, the foreign secretary, William Hague, said 31 British nationals and a further 11 with dual nationality were known to have been detained by Israel.

Twenty-five Britons arrived on three planes, which touched down at Istanbul airport between 2.40am and 3.10am. The Britons were among hundreds of deported activists who were given a hero&apos;s welcome when they arrived in Turkey. A few thousand jubilant relatives and supporters, waving Palestinian and Turkish flags, burst into applause outside the airport, chanting &quot;God is great!&quot;. Another crowd celebrated their return in central Istanbul.&quot;Turkey is proud of you!&quot; the crowd chanted as they shouted &quot;down with Israel!&quot;. The Turkish deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc and other politicians welcomed the returned detainees at the airport. &quot;They faced barbarism and oppression but returned with pride,&quot; Arinc said. John Reilly, a spokesman for the British embassy in Istanbul, said the British contingent were in good health. &quot;Everyone was OK, but they were tired and stressed,&quot; he said, adding that they were given free accomodation in an Istanbul hotel by the state-owned Turkish Airlines, which has also offered each of them a free ticket back to London. Some of the Britons were attending the funerals at noon today of the Turkish activists killed on Monday when Israeli forces stormed the Mavi Marmara ship in international waters off the coast of Israel. IHH, the Turkish charity that operated the boat, was said to be co-ordinating the activities of those Britons keen to show solidarity with Turkish colleagues who were killed and injured. Among those staying for the ceremonies is Alex Harrison, 32, an activist with the Free Gaza movement, who called her family in England at 6am today. She does not have a passport or money and has yet to be reunited with her possessions. Others are understood to be on their way back to the UK immediately and due to arrive later today. The Israelis had returned some of the activists&apos; possessions, but not all of their passports, the embassy said. &quot;We dealt with their travel document needs, helped them get some money and to get in touch with family and loved ones,&quot; said Reilly.Three air ambulance planes carrying wounded activists had landed in Ankara earlier. They were bussed to a medical centre to undergo treatment, NTV television said. Earlier, Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, rejected calls to lift the blockade on Hamas-ruled Gaza, insisting the ban prevents missile attacks on Israel. He labelled worldwide criticism of his navy&apos;s bloody raid on a pro-Palestinian flotilla as &quot;hypocrisy&quot;. &quot;This was not the Love Boat,&quot; Netanyahu said in an address to the nation, referring to the vessel boarded by commandos, setting off clashes that led to the deaths of nine activists. &quot;It was a hate boat.&quot; While Israeli officials spent most of the day trying to contain the flood of diplomatic condemnation of the raid, Netanyahu was anything but conciliatory in his first nationally broadcast comments since Monday&apos;s military action. &quot;Israel is facing an attack of international hypocrisy,&quot; he said, asserting that the Jewish state is the victim of an Iran-backed campaign to arm the Hamas rulers of Gaza with missiles that could hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Netanyahu said the aim of the flotilla was to break the blockade, not to bring aid to Gaza. If the blockade ended, he warned, hundreds of ships would bring in thousands of missiles from Iran, to be aimed at Israel and beyond. The result, he said, would be an Iranian port on the Mediterranean. &quot;The same countries that are criticising us today should know that they would be targeted tomorrow,&quot; Netanyahu said. Seven planes were being used to deport 527 activists to Turkey and Greece, Israeli interior ministry spokeswoman Sabine Haddad said. Seven other activists remained in Israeli hospitals for treatment of wounds suffered during the Israeli raid, she said. After all the planes took off, the Israeli foreign ministry said three activists remained in detention over &quot;documentation and other issues&quot;. The three were from Ireland, Australia and Italy. About a dozen female activists scuffled with security officers at the airport but were quickly subdued by authorities, Israeli officials said. Officials said no charges would be filed and the women were deported as planned. The UN, Europe and others harshly criticised Israel after its commandos stormed the six-ship flotilla in international waters, setting off the clashes. About 700 activists \u2013 including 400 Turks \u2013 were trying to break the Israeli and Egyptian naval blockade of the Gaza Strip by bringing in 10,000 tons of aid. Turkey&apos;s parliament urged its government to review all ties with Israel as the country prepared to welcome home Turkish activists who had been detained after the raid. Israel rejects claims that Gaza \u2013 which has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since the Islamic militant group came to power in 2007 \u2013 is experiencing a humanitarian crisis. Israel says it allows more than enough food, medicine and supplies into the territory. As Netanyahu rebuffed calls to lift the blockade, cabinet minister Isaac Herzog indicated Israel would oppose calls from the UN and others for an independent investigation of the raid. &quot;We are the last nation [that] you can say doesn&apos;t check itself,&quot; he told The Associated Press, while acknowledging that Israel was facing serious diplomatic trouble. &quot;We are trying to take full control of this crisis management and move forward.&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the US is &quot;working to improve the humanitarian conditions&quot; in Gaza, but he also stressed the Obama administration was &quot;greatly supportive&quot; of Israel&apos;s security and &quot;that&apos;s not going to change&quot;. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, also did not call for an end to the blockade, but she pressed Israel to allow greater access to humanitarian relief supplies. The Irish prime minister, Brian Cowen, has appealed to Israel to let a private Irish ship deliver its aid cargo to Gaza, but he admitted that Israel would probably block the ship because part of the cargo was concrete, which Israel bans from Gaza because it might be used by Hamas. The 1,200-ton ship Rachel Corrie is also carrying wheelchairs and other medical supplies, organisers said. It was named after a US student crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer while protesting against house demolitions in Gaza. The ship was supposed to join the aid flotilla but was delayed by mechanical problems and is waiting off the Libyan coast. Those aboard include M\u00e1iread Corrigan, a 1976 Nobel peace prizewinner from Northern Ireland, and Denis Halliday, who previously ran UN humanitarian aid programmes in Iraq. Israel dropped plans to prosecute dozens of pro-Palestinian activists detained in the raid, opting instead to deport them all immediately in an apparent effort to limit the diplomatic damage from the raid. &quot;Keeping them here would do more damage to the country&apos;s vital interests than good,&quot; Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein wrote in the order. In Turkey, Yavuz Dede, the vice-president of the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief, alleged Israel had failed to account for all the passengers and crew on the six ships and was deliberately delaying the activists&apos; departure to cover up the missing persons. &quot;We see this delay in the planes&apos; [taking off] as an attempt to disguise the loss of people,&quot; Dede told a press conference at the foundation&apos;s Istanbul headquarters. The Israeli interior ministry, however, said all those aboard the aid convoy had been accounted for. Haddad listed 702 activists being deported and seven still in Israeli hospitals. She said five were taken to the Lebanese border and repatriated there.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-03T14:31:00Z", "title": "Gaza flotilla attack: British activists arrive in Turkey", "sentences": ["&quot;Israel is facing an attack of international hypocrisy,&quot; he said, asserting that the Jewish state is the victim of an Iran-backed campaign to arm the Hamas rulers of Gaza with missiles that could hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/03/gaza-flotilla-attack-british-activists-return-turkey"}, {"tags": ["South Africa", "Nuclear weapons", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Africa"], "article": "An apartheid-era cabinet minister carried a &quot;nuclear trigger&quot; to South Africa from Israel as part of Pretoria&apos;s efforts to build an atom bomb, according to a report in a Johannesburg newspaper. Two renowned South African journalists have revealed that Eschel Rhoodie, the apartheid government&apos;s information minister who played a central role in establishing military ties to Israel, privately described in 1979 how he had transported &quot;the trigger&quot; as hand luggage on a flight from Tel Aviv. But they say they were unable to publish the account at the time because of censorship and the former minister&apos;s concerns for his safety. Allister Sparks \u2013 who in the 70s was editor of the influential but now defunct Rand Daily Mail \u2013 said he decided to go public with Rhoodie&apos;s admission, despite previous guarantees of secrecy, following last week&apos;s revelations in the Guardian and in a new book, The Unspoken Alliance, that Israel offered to sell nuclear warheads to apartheid South Africa. Writing in the Business Day newspaper, Sparks said Rhoodie travelled regularly to Israel in the mid-70s, and on occasions was accompanied by South Africa&apos;s then intelligence chief, Hendrik van den Bergh. &quot;Rhoodie said talks had taken place between the two sides which had ultimately led to he and Van den Bergh being assigned the task of bringing &quot;the trigger&quot; to SA \u2013 which he said they did by packing it in a tea chest and transporting it as part of their hand-luggage on a South African Airways commercial flight,&quot; Sparks wrote. Rhoodie later revealed the information to the Rand Daily Mail&apos;s chief investigative reporter, Mervyn Rees, whose work had exposed a government-run slush fund that brought down the then president, John Vorster, and the minister himself. Rees confirmed Sparks&apos;s account to the Guardian, adding that Rhoodie did not give full details about the &quot;trigger&quot;. &quot;I questioned him about it and he said I can&apos;t give you any of the details but suffice to say it was a vital component, it was a trigger, that would be used for South Africa&apos;s nuclear capability,&quot; said Rees. It is possible that what Rhoodie called a trigger was tritium, a radioactive isotope required to explode certain types of nuclear bombs. It has been revealed, although not officially acknowledged, that Israel supplied South Africa with 30g of tritium in the mid-70s, enough to build a dozen atom bombs. Apartheid-era officials have denied the tritium was used as part of the country&apos;s nuclear weapons programme and have pointed out that ultimately South Africa developed a type of atomic bomb that did not require that particular radioactive isotope. But Sparks and Rees note that Rhoodie clearly said that what he called the trigger was delivered from Israel as part of South Africa&apos;s development of a nuclear weapon which provides further evidence that the two countries were co-operating. Rhoodie, who died in 1993, told Rees that he became a point man in dealing with the Israelis after developing contacts while taking diving holidays in an Israeli resort. Rhoodie&apos;s meetings with the then Israeli defence minister, Shimon Peres, were an important step in establishing what would become very close collaboration in developing weapons. Peres, who is now Israel&apos;s president, wrote a letter to Rhoodie in 1974 praising the South African&apos;s leading role in initiating &quot;a vitally important co-operation between the two countries&quot;. Rees said Rhoodie confided in him during a series of lengthy conversations in Ecuador and then the south of France after he had been driven from office after the scandal over tens of millions of funds diverted from the defence budget to secret propaganda projects. Rees said that although his reporting in the Rand Daily Mail was instrumental in exposing the scandal, Rhoodie was angered by what he viewed as his scapegoating by others in the government and decided to reveal what he knew about secret projects. Rees said that during a meeting with Rhoodie in France in March 1979, Van den Bergh called the former minister to a meeting in Paris. &quot;He went off and came back the next day in a state of some agitation and said he&apos;d been virtually threatened by Van den Bergh, not on behalf of the South Africans but by the Israelis in terms of any disclosure that might be made regarding South Africa&apos;s nuclear capability. He was clearly shaken about it,&quot; said Rees. Rhoodie touched on Van den Bergh&apos;s warning in his 1983 book, The Real Information Scandal. &quot;I had obtained much of this top secret information for the simple reason that I was one of the people who pioneered relations with certain states overseas,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I assured [Van den Bergh] that the various projects which he was concerned about would never be released unless, I said, I were to die an unnatural death.&quot; Rhoodie and Rees became friends during the interviews, with Rees at one point delivering food and helping to care for the former minister when he was locked up in a French prison after the South African government sought his extradition over allegations of embezzling state funds. Rees said he believes Rhoodie&apos;s account because he proved to have given reliable accounts of other secret operations. Rhoodie agreed to talk to the Rand Daily Mail on the condition he could withhold publication of information he ultimately decided should not be disclosed. He applied that to the revelations about the nuclear cooperation. Sparks said that the censorship laws of the time would have prevented him from printing it. But today he said that with Rhoodie no longer alive and fresh revelations about South Africa&apos;s nuclear ties to Israel, the time had come to reveal the truth. &quot;We do so because we believe it is now clear that there was nuclear collaboration between Israel and South Africa that enabled both sides to develop the bomb \u2013 and that given the state of nuclear proliferation in the world today it is in the global public interest that all available information about shady dealings with these apocalyptic weapons be brought into the open,&quot; Sparks wrote. In response to the latest revelations, Peres&apos;s spokesperson, Ayalet Frisch, pointed to a statement by the former South African president, FW de Klerk, that his country had not co-operated with any foreign government in developing its nuclear weapons. De Klerk made a similar claim to the South African parliament in 1993 when he said that the country at no point acquired nuclear weapons technology or materials from another state nor did it co-operate with foreign governments in developing its atomic bombs. However, that has since been challenged by revelations about the amount of yellowcake uranium South Africa supplied to Israel, the tritium deliveries and the joint development and testing in South Africa of missiles to carry nuclear weapons.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-03T17:13:07Z", "title": "Apartheid-era minister carried 'nuclear trigger' in hand luggage to South Africa", "sentences": ["Two renowned South African journalists have revealed that Eschel Rhoodie, the apartheid government&apos;s information minister who played a central role in establishing military ties to Israel, privately described in 1979 how he had transported &quot;the trigger&quot; as hand luggage on a flight from Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/03/south-africa-nuclear-trigger-israel"}, {"tags": ["Turkey", "Gaza", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": "Turks turned out in their thousands yesterday for the funeral of eight of the nine pro-Palestinian activists killed when Israeli commandos stormed a &quot;freedom flotilla&quot; attempting to bring aid to besieged Gaza, as Arab states vowed to use &quot;all means&quot; to break the blockade by Israel. &quot;Israel is the angel of death,&quot; angry crowds chanted as the coffins, draped in Turkish and Palestinian flags, were borne aloft outside Istanbul&apos;s Fatih mosque. &quot;We are all soldiers of Hamas,&quot; they shouted, referring to the Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip. All nine dead men \u2013 eight Turkish nationals and a Turk with a US passport \u2013 were aboard the Mavi Marmara when armed commandos boarded it in international waters on Monday. The subsequent shootings by commandos triggered fury at Israel and an international chorus of calls to lift Israel&apos;s three-year closure of the coastal territory. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the US victim was Furkan Dogan, and that American authorities in Turkey had met with his father to express condolences and offer consular services. &quot;Our friends have been massacred,&quot; said Bulent Yildirim, the head of the Islamic charity IHH. &quot;We became martyrs.&quot; Turkey&apos;s president, Abdullah Gul, said his country&apos;s once close ties with Israel would never be the same again. In Tel Aviv, Israelis later demonstrated outside Turkey&apos;s embassy, throwing stones and calling its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a &quot;terrorist&quot;. In Cairo, Arab foreign ministers meeting in emergency session condemned Israeli &quot;state piracy and terrorism&quot; and vowed to break the siege of Gaza &quot;by all means&quot;. The meeting demanded action from the UN security council over this &quot;serious and flagrant violation of international law&quot;. Syria&apos;s president, Bashar al-Assad, a key supporter of Hamas, called the flotilla incident a &quot;turning point&quot; in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Assad was speaking to four Syrians who were on the ships. The UN, backed by the US, Britain and other states, has described the blockade of Gaza as &quot;unsustainable and unacceptable&quot; because of the suffering inflicted on its 1.5 million people. Israel insists its purpose is to stop weapons being smuggled in, and has accused the world of bias and hypocrisy. But it has also made clear it wants to bring down Hamas. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel&apos;s foreign minister, vowed yesterday that the maritime blockade would not be breached \u2013 warning that the MV Rachel Corrie, still heading for Gaza, would be stopped. US officials have spoken of needing a &quot;new approach&quot; to Gaza which would recognise Israel&apos;s security needs while trying to boost the flow of supplies. Britain&apos;s approach is similar, though both rule out talks with Hamas. Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said last night he was looking at &quot;creative solutions&quot; for easy aid flows into Gaza. Earlier this week, the security council also called for the Israeli interception to be the subject of a &quot;prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards&quot;, but stopped short of calling for an independent international investigation. Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, made clear on Wednesday that if there is no such national probe, the UK will support one conducted under international auspices, like the controversial Goldstone commission on last year&apos;s Gaza war. The challenge facing any inquiry was underlined by differing accounts of what happened aboard the Mavi Marmara. &quot;There were bullets flying all over the place,&quot; Sarah Colborne of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign told a London press conference. &quot;We asked for the Israelis to stop the attacks. We asked this in English: &apos;We are not resisting, please help the injured&apos;. Instead of helping the injured, the saloon remained surrounded by soldiers targeting individuals with laser sights.&quot; Israel has held to its line that its troops fired only in self-defence, but apparently dropped its earlier claim that activists had links to al-Qaida. But the account of Andre Abu Khalil, a cameraman for Al Jazeera TV, described how activists seized four Israelis before other commandos stormed aboard, firing on activists. &quot;There were four Israeli soldiers brought to the lowest deck. They had fracture wounds,&quot; the Lebanese told Reuters. The soldiers were captured during attempts to descend on to the ship from helicopters. On Monday, an Israeli commando said he was struck with metal bars while other troops were held down and stripped of their helmets and equipment. &quot;Twenty Turkish men formed a human shield to prevent the Israeli soldiers from scaling the ship, said Abu Khalil. &quot;They had slingshots, water pipes and sticks. They were banging the pipes on the side of the ship to warn the Israelis not to get closer.&quot; The standoff lasted 10 minutes until the Israelis opened fire. Seeking to limit the damage caused by the incident to already fragile peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, George Mitchell, Barack Obama&apos;s special envoy to the region, warned the &quot;tragedy of the last week&quot; must not undermine the indirect negotiations he is mediating. Hamas opposes those talks. Relations between the US and Israel have been at their lowest point for decades in recent months, mainly because of rows between Obama and Netanyahu over Israel&apos;s expansion of settlements. But the Obama administration has been trying to balance traditional US support for Israel with nudging it to make concessions on peace. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, in an interview with the Public Broadcasting Service channel, came down more on the side of Israel than other Obama administration figures. &quot;You can argue whether Israel should have dropped people on to that ship or not,&quot; Biden said. &quot;But the truth of the matter is Israel has a right to know \u2013 they&apos;re at war with Hamas \u2013 whether or not arms are being smuggled in.&quot; But he qualified this with a call to Israel to be &quot;more generous to the Palestinian people who are in trouble in Gaza&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-03T23:30:00Z", "title": "Gaza flotilla attack: Turks killed by Israeli soldiers given heroes' funeral", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv, Israelis later demonstrated outside Turkey&apos;s embassy, throwing stones and calling its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a &quot;terrorist&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/03/gaza-flotilla-attack-turkey-funeral"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "World news", "Gaza flotilla"], "article": "It&apos;s Friday, the Muslim weekend, and the Sharif family are looking forward to the highlight of their week: chicken for lunch. In the bare kitchen of their home in the overcrowded Beach refugee camp, Amal Sharif, 45, bends over a steaming pan of maftoul \u2013 stewed chicken with couscous \u2013 as the younger of her 10 children run in and out in excited anticipation. Chicken \u2013 this large one cost 60 shekels (\u00a310.60) \u2013 is a once-a-week treat. The rest of the time the family mainly exists on UN handouts of flour, rice and oil, alongside small cash grants. The children ask for fruit, an impossible luxury, and the family has not eaten beef for a year. For 18 years, her husband, Adal Sharif, 47, earned a good living working for a shipping firm in Israel. That ended in 2000 when Israel sealed Gazans behind fences and walls at the start of the second intifada. His next career, as a fisherman, ended when his boat was destroyed during the three-week Gaza war in 2008-9. Clutching prayer beads in one hand and a cigarette in the other, Sharif says: &quot;My income has dropped 100%. When you have no money, everything is too expensive.&quot; His daily struggle to feed his family contradicts statements this week by Israeli officials that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Since Israel launched a bloody assault on the flotilla attempting to bring aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, Tel Aviv has repeatedly insisted that the mission was redundant. But the piles of food in the markets \u2013 fruit, vegetables, nuts, sweets even live rabbits \u2013 are unaffordable to most in the strip and obscure a complex picture of rising poverty, a parallel economy, and brewing anger among Gazans at the micro-control that Israel exerts over their daily lives. What is allowed in and what is denied is ever-changing according to mystifying and capricious criteria. To Gazans it is hard to understand why coriander is banned but cinnamon is allowed, why children are denied toys and car owners spare parts. &quot;Two weeks ago they stopped coffee beans,&quot; says Raed Fatouh, who co-ordinates with the Israelis on the crossing points. &quot;I called them, and they said they couldn&apos;t allow in beans, only ground coffee.&quot; The reason, he said, was that beans require grinding and that could be categorised as an industrial process. &quot;It&apos;s the same with butter. If it comes in a 20kg slab they won&apos;t allow it because it needs to be cut up. But they will allow in small packets of butter. They won&apos;t let anything in that could provide work for a small business.&quot; Basic food aid is permitted. Eight in 10 Gazans are dependent on aid, and the distribution points around Gaza City were this week doing considerably brisker business than grocery stores. At one depot, run by the UN relief and works agency, Dina Aldan, 22, is queueing amid a throng of women in black jilbab clutching her ration card along with her five-month old baby, Najwan. Through a warehouse hatch she is thrust a clear plastic bag for her family of five: two bottles of cooking oil, 3kg (6.6lb) of sugar, 3kg of rice, a bag of milk and a can of corned mutton. The 30kg of flour Aldan is entitled to would require someone with stronger arms. &quot;I get these supplies every three months but they only last one week,&quot; she says. &quot;I have to go the market for other food, but everything is so expensive, the quality is not good and many things I can&apos;t get.&quot; Her husband, a glass worker, works one day in 10. Their home was destroyed in the Gaza war and now the rent drains the family income. For Dina Aldan and many like her there is a difficult choice about whether to take home the aid or to sell it to the traders who wait outside the depot. The UN says it does not police what recipients do with the aid, but acknowledges that the poor have a variety of needs that they struggle to meet. &quot;The slow death of the Gazan economy means that some of the poorest people have been reduced to a demonetarised medieval barter system,&quot; says a UN spokesman, Chris Gunness. Gaza&apos;s once-thriving legitimate economy has been largely supplanted by the illegal import of goods smuggled through tunnels from Egypt. This parallel market, which is estimated to provide employment for about 200,000 people, superficially appears to be catering well to the needs of the population. Israel points to the wide range of goods available in Gaza&apos;s shops. But customers and shop owners have a different story to tell. In a well-stocked grocery store in Gaza City, 62-year-old Abu Hassan is poring over his accounts spread out on the counter. His family have owned the shop for 50 years, but business has never been worse. &quot;How many customers did you see come into the shop while you&apos;ve been here?&quot; he asks. &quot;Not one.&quot; The tunnel goods are very expensive, he says, and poor quality. He produces a packet of Egyptian biscuits, crushed inside their wrappings. He had been forced to jettison the entire consignment without compensation from his dealers. &quot;There&apos;s nothing I can do, and I had paid for it in advance,&quot; he says. Nearby, Walid Naim, 42, gestures to the piles of high-definition televisions, blenders, microwaves, washing machines, fridge freezers, hair straighteners and vacuum cleaners in his family-owned business. &quot;Everything is from the tunnels,&quot; he says, sipping from a tiny porcelain cup of Arabic coffee. &quot;We used to make money, but now people have no cash to buy goods.&quot; Electricity blackouts for up to eight hours a day don&apos;t help. &quot;Why buy electrical goods if you can&apos;t use them?&quot; Naim asks with a shrug. &quot;The world doesn&apos;t understand the crisis in Gaza,&quot; adds his brother, Wissam, 35, against the headache-inducing thrum of generators that is part of Gaza&apos;s soundtrack. &quot;The whole world is punishing us.&quot; There are suggestions that, following the international furore generated by the assault on the aid flotilla, Israel could ease its blockade to allow additional food relief into the Gaza Strip. But the siege of Gaza is not just about bags of flour or bottles of cooking oil, important though they are. The health system is in crisis, the UN says, with a critical shortage of medical equipment. The UN is unable to repair schools damaged in the Gaza war, or build new ones to cope with the exploding population. Paper, desks and other basic school supplies are hard to obtain. And the impact of the siege extends beyond material items to a psychological isolation. &quot;We are also under siege mentally \u2013 we are disconnected from the rest of the world,&quot; says economist Omar Shaban. Analysts and aid organisations reject Israel&apos;s dismissal of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. &quot;People think Gaza is like Darfur,&quot; says Shaban. &quot;It&apos;s totally different. It&apos;s not about a lack of food, but the number of people who can&apos;t afford to buy the food is increasing. That is a humanitarian crisis.&quot; His point is echoed by Gunness. &quot;This is not a sub-Saharan crisis. It&apos;s a politically driven crisis with grave humanitarian consequences.&quot; Back in the jumble of breeze-block buildings in the Beach refugee camp, Adal Sharif is contemplating the future for his large brood of children. &quot;I&apos;m not optimistic,&quot; he says, twisting his prayer beads. &quot;But I&apos;m asking Europe to put pressure on Israel to lift the siege, to let my children live and feel freedom.&quot; Gaza in figures \u2022 Unemployment is at 44% \u2022 Eight out of 10 Gazans are dependent on aid \u2022 The number of people defined as the &quot;abject poor&quot; (unable to feed themselves or their families) has increased from 100,000 to 300,000 in past 12 months \u2022 GDP per capita fell from $2,500 (\u00a31,718) in 1998/99 to $600 last year \u2022 An estimated 20,000 people work in the tunnels industry \u2022 Oxfam estimates that last week 631 trucks of carrying humanitarian supplies were permitted entry \u2013 22% of the weekly average (2,807 truckloads) before Israel&apos;s blockade \u2022 Last week 871 tonnes of cooking gas reportedly entered Gaza, half of the normal weekly level \u2022 1,063m litres of industrial fuel were delivered that week for Gaza&apos;s power plant \u2013 only 30% of the 3.5m litres needed weekly.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-04T14:00:25Z", "title": "Gaza's markets of unaffordable goods conceal reality of people under siege", "sentences": ["Since Israel launched a bloody assault on the flotilla attempting to bring aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, Tel Aviv has repeatedly insisted that the mission was redundant."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/04/gaza-flotilla-humanitarian-crisis"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Iran", "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news"], "article": "Iran has warned that it could send Revolutionary Guard naval units to escort humanitarian aid convoys seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza \u2013 a move that would certainly be challenged by Israel. Any such Iranian involvement, raised today by an aide to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would constitute a serious escalation of already high tensions with Israel, which accuses Tehran of seeking to build a nuclear weapon and of backing Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza. &quot;Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guard naval forces are prepared to escort the peace and freedom convoys that carry humanitarian assistance for the defenceless and oppressed people of Gaza with all their strength,&quot; pledged Hojjatoleslam Ali Shirazi, Khamenei&apos;s personal representative to the guards corps. The threat came as the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, dismissed a UN proposal for an international commission to investigate last week&apos;s commando assault on aid ships, in which nine people died. Another aid ship, the Rachel Corrie, carrying Irish and other peace activists, was boarded peacefully by Israeli forces on Saturday, escorted to the port of Ashdod, and its passengers deported. Netanyahu has defended Israel&apos;s right to maintain the blockade by arguing that without it Gaza would become an &quot;Iranian port&quot; and Hamas missiles would strike Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israel&apos;s undeclared aim is to weaken or bring down the Hamas government. Iran continued to exploit the &quot;freedom flotilla&quot; affair to lambast Israel. Its foreign minister, Manuchehr Mottaki, told the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah on Sunday that Israel&apos;s crime was &quot;another instance of the Zionist regime&apos;s brazen and merciless treatment of Muslims, especially the oppressed Palestinian people.&quot; Mottaki also called for a UN resolution condemning Israel. The security council is discussing imposing new sanctions on Iran because of its failure to meet international demands over its nuclear programme. Iran and Israel have had no diplomatic relations since the 1979 revolution and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad regularly predicts the disappearance of the Jewish state as well as denying the Holocaust. Shirazi said Iran should encourage international efforts to break the blockade. &quot;We should expose our enemies to spontaneous global action and not let them achieve their heinous goals,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Mehr news agency. Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards, which have a command structure separate from the regular armed forces, are fiercely loyal to the supreme leader. Khamenei has attacked the raid as a &quot;mistake&quot; that &quot;showed how barbaric the Zionists are&quot;. Israel&apos;s determination to strike at links between Iran and Hamas was dramatically demonstrated in January when presumed Mossad agents in Dubai assassinated Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, who was described as the Hamas official in charge of smuggling Iranian weapons into Gaza. Israel&apos;s no-compromise attitude to aid convoys could be tested again after two Lebanese organisations pledged to send boats to Gaza in the next few days. Reporters Without Borders is attempting to assemble 25 European activists and 50 journalists for a boat leaving Beirut. The Free Palestine Movement is planning a similar attempt. George Galloway, the founder of Viva Palestina, announced in London that two simultaneous convoys &quot;one by land via Egypt and the other by sea&quot; would set out in September to break the Gaza blockade. The sea convoy of up to 60 ships will travel around the Mediterranean gathering ships, cargo and volunteers.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-06T20:20:23Z", "title": "Gaza blockade: Iran offers escort to next aid convoy", "sentences": ["Netanyahu has defended Israel&apos;s right to maintain the blockade by arguing that without it Gaza would become an &quot;Iranian port&quot; and Hamas missiles would strike Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/06/gaza-blockade-iran-aid-convoy"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Gaza flotilla"], "article": "The Israeli government has been forced to apologise for circulating a spoof video mocking activists aboard the Gaza flotilla, nine of who were shot dead by Israeli forces last week. The YouTube clip, set to the tune of the 1985 charity single We Are the World, features Israelis dressed as Arabs and activists, waving weapons while singing: &quot;We con the world, we con the people. We&apos;ll make them all believe the IDF (Israel Defence Force) is Jack the Ripper.&quot; It continues: &quot;There&apos;s no people dying, so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all.&quot; The Israeli government press office distributed the video link to foreign journalists at the weekend, but within hours emailed them an apology, saying it had been an error. Press office director Danny Seaman said the video did not reflect official state opinion, but in his personal capacity he thought it was &quot;fantastic&quot;. Government spokesman Mark Regev said the video reflected how Israelis felt about the incident. &quot;I called my kids in to watch it because I thought it was funny,&quot; he said. &quot;It is what Israelis feel. But the government has nothing to do with it.&quot; The clip features a group led by the Jerusalem Post&apos;s deputy managing editor Caroline Glick, wearing keffiyehs and calling themselves the Flotilla Choir. The footage is interspersed with clips from the recent Israeli raid on the Gaza-bound aid ship, the Mavi Marmara. The clip has been praised in Israel, where the mass-circulation daily Yediot Aharonot said the singers &quot;defended Israel better than any of the experts&quot;. But Didi Remez, an Israeli who runs the liberal-left news analysis blog Coteret, said the clip was &quot;repulsive&quot; and reflected how out of touch Israeli opinion was with the rest of the world. &quot;It shows a complete lack of understanding of how the incident is being perceived abroad,&quot; he said. Award-winning Israeli journalist Meron Rapoport said the clip demonstrated prejudice against Muslims. &quot;It&apos;s roughly done, not very sophisticated, anti-Muslim \u2013 and childish for the government to be behind such a clip,&quot; he said. A similar press office email was sent to foreign journalists two weeks ago, recommending a gourmet restaurant and Olympic-sized swimming pool in Gaza to highlight Israel&apos;s claim there is no humanitarian crisis there. Journalists who complained the email was in poor taste were told they had &quot;no sense of humour&quot;. Last week, the Israel Defence Force had to issue a retraction over an audio clip it had claimed was a conversation between Israeli naval officials and people on the Mavi Marmara, in which an activist told soldiers to &quot;go back to Auschwitz&quot;. The clip was carried by Israeli and international press, but today the army released a &quot;clarification/correction&quot;, explaining that it had edited the footage and that it was not clear who had made the comment. The Israeli army also backed down last week from an earlier claim that soldiers were attacked by al-Qaida &quot;mercenaries&quot; aboard the Gaza flotilla. An article appearing on the IDF spokesperson&apos;s website with the headline: &quot;Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be al-Qaida mercenaries&quot;, was later changed to &quot;Attackers of the IDF Soldiers found without identification papers,&quot; with the information about al-Qaida removed from the main article. An army spokesperson told the Guardian there was no evidence proving such a link to the terror organisation. While the debate over accounts of the flotilla raid continues, Israel is facing more boycotting. In the past week, three international acts, including the US rock band the Pixies, have cancelled concerts in Tel Aviv. Best-settling authors Alice Walker and Iain Banks have backed the boycott campaign, with Banks announcing his books won&apos;t be translated into Hebrew. Dockworker unions in Sweden and South Africa have refused to handle Israeli ships, while the UK&apos;s Unite union just passed a motion to boycott Israeli companies. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 June 2010.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, proposed a commission of inquiry headed by the former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer, who is an expert in maritime law. The commission would include representatives of Israel, the US and Turkey. All nine activists killed in the operation were Turkish; one held joint US citizenship. Ban discussed the plan with Netanyahu, who later briefed party colleagues on the call, saying: &quot;We need to consider the issue carefully and level-headedly while monitoring Israel&apos;s national interests.&quot; Israel would not react or take decisions under the pressure of events, an official who was present at the meeting said. Israel&apos;s ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, was more explicit: &quot;We are rejecting an international commission. We are discussing with the Obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place,&quot; he said. Despite global condemnation of last week&apos;s raid and demands for a thorough and impartial investigation and an easing of Israel&apos;s blockade on Gaza, there was no discussion of the issues at today&apos;s cabinet meeting. Important decisions relating to security issues are usually taken by a smaller security council, rather than full Israeli cabinet. However, according to the official, there are no firm plans for the smaller group to meet. Israel is also pursuing compromise measures to deflect growing pressure to relax the blockade. Significantly, the US has added its voice to calls for a new policy, with the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, describing the current siege as &quot;unsustainable&quot;. Signs of divergent views within the cabinet came from Israel&apos;s welfare minister, Isaac Herzog, who called for the siege policy to be reconsidered. &quot;The time has come to do away with the blockade, ease the restrictions on the inhabitants and find another alternative,&quot; he said. The government claims it has indicated a willingness for greater flexibility in the amount and type of aid it allows into Gaza through land crossings, but insists it will maintain its naval blockade for security reasons. &quot;The policy was not static. It was moving anyway [before the flotilla] and we will continue to move,&quot; an official said. Aid agencies say any relaxation of the blockade has been minimal and the current situation is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the 80% of Gazans dependent on international aid. Britain&apos;s shadow foreign secretary, David Miliband, described the isolation of Gaza as &quot;a stain on policy right across the Middle East&quot;. &quot;I think there have been a series of deadly and self-defeating actions by successive Israeli governments in respect of Gaza,&quot; he told the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show. The UK today announced a \u00a319m donation of aid to Gaza. Israel&apos;s hard line on future shipping aid convoys could be as tested as early as this week after two organisations pledged to send boats carrying aid to Gaza in the next few days. Reporters Without Borders was attempting to assemble 25 European activists and 50 journalists for a boat leaving Beirut. The Free Palestine Movement was planning a similar operation. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 who was the subject of fresh vitriol in the Israeli media today \u2013 had raised the idea of personally joining an aid ship to Gaza, according to Lebanese media reports. Turkey last week recalled its ambassador to Israel. Israel&apos;s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, today insisted that &quot;it is inconceivable that we should apologise to the Turkish government&quot;. He hinted that Turkey was heading in the same direction as Iran, saying Iran had been a &quot;good friend&quot; to Israel in the 1970s. This was echoed by his deputy, Danny Ayalon, who said: &quot;If they sever relations, it is clear they are switching sides in the direction of extremist Islam.&quot; The 19 passengers and crew who were on board the aid ship the Rachel Corrie when it was forcibly diverted to the Israeli port of Ashdod are due to arrive in Ireland tomorrow after being deported from Israel. The Israeli government, still battling for the dominance of its version of events surrounding the flotilla assault, attempted to draw a distinction between the Rachel Corrie and the Mavi Marmara, the Turkish vessel that was the scene of last week&apos;s bloodshed. &quot;The entire world saw the difference between a humanitarian flotilla and a hate flotilla by violent, terrorism supporting extremists,&quot; Netanyahu told party colleagues. The US rock band Pixies cancelled a concert in Tel Aviv in protest at last week&apos;s bloodshed. The decision followed similar moves by Klaxons and Gorillaz.

For some time now, rather similar pieces regarding Turkey have been published in the American and European press. It&apos;s clear that, following the bloody act of piracy in international waters against the Mavi Marmara carrying humanitarian aid volunteers from Turkey and 32 other nations, there has been a mobilisation of anti-Turkey information warfare. Just as Teitelbaum&apos;s perspective on the event is problematic, the information he cites is almost entirely out of touch with reality. Above all, just as the venture was not one of pro-Hamas militants, nor was it solely a Turkish enterprise, either. It was organised by an international civilian initiative known as Free Gaza. Among the volunteers, who were nearly all aboard the Mavi Marmara, were the civilian citizens of 33 nations, including the US, UK, Australia, Greece, Canada, Malaysia, Morocco, Serbia, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Kuwait. Also among the volunteers were 15 members of the European parliament, the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Ireland and 85-year-old Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein. Just as there were Turks and others on the ship, there were, alongside Muslims, Christians, Jews and atheists. It is greatly misleading to blame Turkey and the Turkish government for this enterprise, which was a civilian and international humanitarian aid effort in the fullest sense. And as much of a deception is it to say that those on the ships constituted a threat to Israel. After all, the humanitarian aid flotilla in question was trying to bring humanitarian aid supplies not to Israeli lands, but to the Gaza Strip, which is suffering under Israel&apos;s inhumane blockade and where 1.4 million civilians are struggling to stay alive amid utter poverty. Just as Israel has no legitimate right of dominion over Gaza or Gaza&apos;s seas, the Israeli military&apos;s armed action that killed nine humanitarian aid volunteers on the Mavi Marmara and left around 20 wounded took place 73 miles away, in international territory. Such an attack shows scant regard for international law and conventions. Teitelbaum&apos;s claim that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan had called for a jihad against Israel is completely baseless and, like his other claims, does not reflect the truth. It is ridiculous to accuse the Turkish people \u2013 who always extended a helping hand to Jews when they were cast out of Spain in 1492, and when they fell victim to the Holocaust in Europe in the 1940s \u2013 of opening a jihad against Israel. From Erdo\u011fan downwards, the Turkish government and Turks have succeeded in distinguishing between the Israeli government and the Israeli people and Jews in their criticisms. Not a single representative of the government, even when uttering harsh criticism of the Israeli government&apos;s incomprehensible attacks, has ever used a discourse that targets Israeli citizens or Jews in general. In order to understand why the bloody Mavi Marmara attack took place, we must recall what has gone on between Turkey and Israel in the last few years. While Turkey, in its capacity as a rising regional peacemaker, played moderator between Syria and Israel, only a few days after a visit of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to Ankara, the Israeli army entered Gaza and killed 1,400 civilians, leaving Ankara feeling shocked and dismayed. Erdo\u011fan, who felt personally betrayed, reacted harshly to the attack on Gaza, leading to his angry statement at Davos (&quot;the Israeli government knows very well how to kill civilians&quot;). Following the Davos incident, Israel made a move to deal a blow to Turkey&apos;s prestige in the region: in a complete violation of the rules of diplomacy, it set up the &quot;low chair&quot; trap for the Turkish ambassador in Tel Aviv. Israel eventually apologised to Turkey after that. Israel has also grown greatly discomfited at Turkey&apos;s taking on a facilitator role between Iran and the west in recent days. Just as Israel was able largely to forestall the latest diplomatic efforts by Turkey and Brazil, it is also working to create the conditions necessary for a military intervention into Iran \u2013 which is a signatory to the NPT and member of the IAEA and, at least in appearance, has its nuclear programme under international supervision. Israel, meanwhile, belongs to neither and is therefore in a tight spot. It also holds Turkey responsible for all this, increasing its resentment. Contrary to what Teitelbaum wrote, Turkey today wants niether to be a new Ottoman empire, nor to fly a flag of jihad against any country or civilisation. Quite the reverse, Turkey with its rising political and diplomatic power is serving world peace and stability to the full extent of its capacity. Turkey&apos;s efforts in peacemaking as part of the Alliance of Civilisations initiative, of which it is co-president with Spain, have have extended to constructive contacts between, for example, Syria and Iraq, different factions in Iraq, factions in Lebanon, Israel and Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Bosnia and Serbia, Russia and Georgia and so on \u2013 completely debunking the idea that Turkey harbours jihadist goals. It&apos;s true that Turkish flags are waved in Muslim countries, but it would be misleading to say that Turkey only maintains good relations with Islamic countries. Turkey today enjoys good relations with all of its neighbours, east and west, north and south. It also takes an active role in many international organisations: the UN Security Council, Nato, G20 and others, and fully shoulders its responsibilities in those roles. The Erdo\u011fan government is working as hard as possible to bring Turkey up to EU norms, and these western-oriented policies and reforms can be seen in the EU&apos;s Turkey progress reports. Far from Teitelbaum&apos;s view, the Erdo\u011fan government is constantly battling obstruction and resistance from deep state groups such as the Ergenekon network. Turks have been oriented toward the west for 250 years. I have confidence that Turkey will continue to strive on all fronts by legal means and will maintain its place on the moral high ground against inhumane attacks and campaigns of lies. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-06-09T13:06:39Z", "title": "Turkey: an honest broker in the Middle East | B\u00fclent Kenes", "sentences": ["Following the Davos incident, Israel made a move to deal a blow to Turkey&apos;s prestige in the region: in a complete violation of the rules of diplomacy, it set up the &quot;low chair&quot; trap for the Turkish ambassador in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/09/turkey-erdogan-israel-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Spain", "Israel", "World news", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "LGBT rights", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": "A delegation of gay residents of Tel Aviv has been banned from joining a gay pride march in Madrid because authorities in the Israeli city have not condemned the recent attack on the Gaza flotilla. &quot;After what has happened, and as human rights campaigners, it seemed barbaric to us to have them taking part,&quot; explained Antonio Poveda, of Spain&apos;s Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transexuals and Bisexuals. &quot;We don&apos;t just defend out own little patch.&quot; The Tel Aviv group have reacted angrily to the decision, claiming that the Madrid activists were getting their priorities wrong by mixing the nine flotilla deaths with gay pride. &quot;I cannot recall anyone asking the Tel Aviv city hall to either support or condemn in this case.

After several meetings with Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, Tony Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet of negotiating parties, told EU foreign ministers that it should soon be possible to get many more everyday goods and building supplies into Gaza. The territory has been blockaded for three years. &quot;In the conversations I&apos;ve had with the Israeli prime minister there is now, in principle, agreement,&quot; Blair said. &quot;They [Israel] will maintain the blockade with respect to arms and combat material but they are prepared to let in goods that are necessary for people&apos;s ordinary lives.&quot; Blair&apos;s suggestion that the blockade could be eased substantially within days was met with scepticism among analysts and NGOs. They predicted that the Israelis would drag out negotiations over what is and is not allowed into Gaza. The former prime minister also pointed to the controversy around the impartiality of the inquiry the Israeli government announced into the flotilla raid by stating that the make-up of the inquiry would trigger a &quot;strong political debate&quot;. Diplomats in Brussels and Luxembourg said Blair had worked furiously in recent days for a breakthrough on relaxing the blockade. He was said to have suggested the former Northern Ireland first minister, Lord Trimble, as one of two international participants in the inquiry into the Israeli attacks on the convoy of boats in the Mediterranean and the killing of nine people. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said that the naming of Trimble and a Canadian judge to the Israeli panel was a welcome step but added that the EU would have wished for more. There would need to be sustained pressure to ensure that the Israeli inquiry was &quot;independent, transparent and credible&quot;, he said. An EU statement said that the inquiry had to be immediate, full and impartial. &quot;To command the confidence of the international community, this should include credible international participation,&quot; it said. Diplomats stressed this should not be construed as criticism of the Israeli decision but as an attempt to keep up the pressure on Tel Aviv. Blair sounded guardedly optimistic about shifting the terms of the Israeli blockade of Gaza so that all goods are allowed in except weapons-related material blacklisted by the Israelis. But diplomats cautioned that there would probably be lengthy and difficult negotiations with the Israelis over the policing, listing and auditing of the goods being transported to Gaza. European officials made plain that they were concentrating on the measures to ease the blockade rather than on the inquiry into the attack. The aim was to make a repeat of the attack on the flotilla impossible. &quot;Full and regular access via land crossings and possibly by sea on the basis of a list of prohibited goods should be the prime aim, while at the same time providing strict control over the destination of imported merchandise,&quot; said the EU ministers. Diplomats stressed that they were operating in the realms of what might be possible with the Israelis to ease the dreadful living conditions in Gaza. Critics noted that Israel would continue to dictate the terms of imprisonment for the population of Gaza. &quot;The EU today stood back from taking the bold steps necessary to ensure the blockade is immediately and completely lifted,&quot; said Elise Ford of Oxfam. &quot;While fewer restrictions on importation of goods will certainly improve the situation, what Gaza needs most are jobs and the ability to export, not just short-term aid and consumer products that, without jobs, the people of Gaza can&apos;t afford to buy.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-06-14T17:45:49Z", "title": "EU raises doubts on Gaza raid inquiry but hopes grow of blockade easing", "sentences": ["Diplomats stressed this should not be construed as criticism of the Israeli decision but as an attempt to keep up the pressure on Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/14/eu-gaza-raid-inquiry"}, {"tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": "While Robert Green was grimly picking the ball out of the net on Saturday night, Nigeria&apos;s Vincent Enyeama was still accepting plaudits for a man-of-the-match performance against Argentina. In an inversion of the usual stereotype some Europe-based goalkeepers have struggled in the opening few matches of this World Cup while several African goalkeepers have excelled. Enyeama&apos;s display was described by no less an attacking force than Lionel Messi, who he denied on at least five occasions, as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Diego Maradona praised his &quot;exceptional performance&quot; as he repelled wave after wave of Argentina attacks.  \u2022 Follow the Guardian&apos;s World Cup team on Twitter\u2022 Sign up to play our great Fantasy Football game\u2022 Stats centre: Get the lowdown on every player\u2022 The latest team-by-team news, features and more  While other goalkeepers, from Green to Australia&apos;s Mark Schwarzer, appear to have been struggling with the way the new Adidas ball behaves at altitude, the 27-year-old saved his team from a drubbing and may have already delivered the best goalkeeping display of this World Cup. Enyeama&apos;s brilliance did not come as any surprise to those who have been following the fortunes of this Nigerian team for some time. Frequently their best player during qualifying, the Hapoel Tel Aviv keeper was linked last summer with a move to the Premier League with Arsenal and Wigan both said to be interested. A few more performances like Saturday&apos;s and he could well seal a switch to England, with West Ham United rumoured to be the latest club to express an interest. But it is not just Enyeama who has turned conventional wisdom about African goalkeeping on its head during the opening week of the first World Cup on the continent. While some of the goalkeeping in this year&apos;s Africa Cup of Nations still left much to be desired, the standard so far in South Africa suggests that among the top nations there has been a marked improvement. &quot;Goalkeeper remains a problem position for many of Africa&apos;s best teams but there are enough very good keepers to end the stereotype of the &apos;typically naive African goalkeeper&apos;,&quot; said Steve Bloomfield, author of the book Africa United: How Football Explains Africa. &quot;Enyeama has been Nigeria&apos;s best player for some time and would not look out of place at a top European club. Cameroon&apos;s Idriss Kameni is a regular in La Liga while Egypt&apos;s Essam El Hadary would, despite his age, still do a good job in the Premier League.&quot; There have been other fine performances in the opening matches. Richard Kingson may not be able to get a game for Wigan Athletic in the Premier League but minutes before Asamoah Gyan scored the penalty that made Ghana the first African nation to secure a victory in this World Cup, he made a crucial stop from Serbia&apos;s Milos Krasic that ensured a clean sheet. South Africa&apos;s goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune was also praised in the wake of his team&apos;s opening draw with Mexico, during which he helped to repel a first\u2011half onslaught that could have left the hosts embarrassed. Gary Bailey, the former Manchester United keeper who is now a commentator in his native South Africa, said Africa&apos;s No1s could not be ranked among the best in the world until they had proved themselves at Europe&apos;s top clubs. &quot;One good match does not mean that Enyeama is a great goalkeeper and one bad match does not mean that Green is a bad goalkeeper. You need to judge a goalkeeper over the course of a tournament or a full season, not on one match,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been good African goalkeepers in the past. But you tend to judge great players by who the biggest clubs are prepared to buy. You&apos;d have to say the top five goalkeepers in the world are all European, with maybe one South American.&quot; However, he conceded that with the eyes of the world on South Africa for the next month, Enyeama and others have the opportunity to make a name for themselves. &quot;In a tournament you have got eight or nine matches. You don&apos;t have to be in the top 10 in the world to have a great eight or nine matches. This is a real chance for some of those guys to impress.&quot; Bloomfield said that while there would still be indifferent performances by African goalkeepers \u2013 hotheaded Algerian goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi&apos;s howler against Slovenia being a case in point \u2013 one legacy of this World Cup might be an end to lazy stereotyping. &quot;We should view African goalies the same way we view their European counterparts. Some are great, some are mediocre and others are in between. The worst mistake of the World Cup is likely to be Green&apos;s but I didn&apos;t hear anyone refer to it as &apos;typically naive European goalkeeping&apos;.&quot; Nigeria Vincent Enyeama Regarded as one of the best keepers in Africa since forcing his way into the Nigeria squad for the 2002 World Cup, where he kept a clean sheet against England. He helped the Nigerian side Enyimba win the African Champions League in 2003 and 2004 which earned him a transfer to Israel.

Everywhere I looked there were people who believed boarding a humanitarian aid convoy in international waters and murdering nine people was a little bit naughty. So I did what I&apos;ve always done as a columnist for the Daily Mail; go where my bigotry leads. Conspiracy theories abound in public life. Almost all of them are based on myth. The simple fact is that global warming is a lie created by politically correct liberals who are holding the universe to ransom. The reality is that not a single glacier has melted in Israel over the last 50 years. Likewise, green activists try to claim the teeny oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico is an environmental disaster. How much oil has been washed up on the beaches of Eilat? None. The legitimacy of the war in Iraq has been similarly subverted. Hard-line Trotskyists say we were led into the war on a lie. This is not the case. After Saddam Hussein was toppled, Mossad found huge caches of nuclear weapons in bunkers throughout the country. Understandably, Mossad chose not to go public with this because, as a responsible government agency, it didn&apos;t want to worry anyone unduly. Not that anyone has ever thanked Israel for this act of global compassion. But this is symptomatic of the way Israel is misrepresented. It is often suggested the Palestinians have an equal right to Israeli lands. This is demonstrably false. If you follow the Old Testament family tree from Adam to Abraham, you can see God gave the country to the Jews. Indeed, it is a mark of Israel&apos;s tolerance that it allows some so-called Palestinians to live in the Gaza slums. And how do the Palestinians repay Israel? By throwing stones. How dare the world complain if Israel responds proportionately by returning the Palestinians to the Stone Age where they belong? These falsehoods are presented as unchallengeable truths; in fact, they are anti-Semitic leftwing ideologies based on twisted evidence. We now live in a world of moral relativism where to believe in scientific inquiry or to be gay or a Muslim is socially acceptable. How can any right thinking person go along with this new age of Reason? The Enlightenment has a lot to answer for. Surely it must be apparent to even Richard Dawkins that he couldn&apos;t have written the God Delusion without God&apos;s help? Though obviously not the Muslim God because he doesn&apos;t exist. Secularism is the curse of modern life. If everyone went to Synagogue to thank the Intelligent Designer there would be no more conflict. Instead there is a global coalition of Muslims, environmentalists and vegetarians whose sole purpose is to destroy the state of Israel. The 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre \u2013 co-ordinated by Osama bin Laden and George Monbiot \u2013 was nothing less than a dry run for a ram raid on the Burger King in central Tel Aviv. Anti-Zionists claim the neocons are in the pockets of the Jews. Nonsense. Reason naturally aligns itself with reason. That is why no reasonable person can possibly be a Muslim. Many of the central tenets of Islam run contrary to Judaism and since Judaism is correct in every respect, ergo it must be irrational to be nice to Muslims. Yet such is our topsy-turvy world it is the Jews who get demonised for trying to do everyone a favour by preventing the Palestinians from becoming a recognised terrorist state. The anti-Semitic lies proliferate at a terrifying speed. The most pernicious is that Israel has no sense of humour. What&apos;s not to laugh about Mossad agents flying in to Dubai and taking out an Arab? All I can say is thank God there are still some fearless media outlets, such as Fox News and the Daily Mail, who are prepared to stand up for the truth. Hey? What&apos;s with the strait-jacket?

She&apos;s setting out to explore art&apos;s relationship with reality, a premise that&apos;s admirable, yet far from straightforward. As Smith&apos;s astute in-the-moment reflections suggest, what we can know of the world is never enough to grasp its pressing complexities. Mark Boulos&apos;s compelling documentary portrait of a machete-wielding resistance group in the Niger Delta is a case in point. In the face of Shell Oil&apos;s takeover of their land, the Nigerians ask why they can&apos;t profit from their own labour, while on another screen opposite, stockbrokers go about their daily business, deaf to their cries.

The 24-year-old artist Petrit Halilaj has a team of builders constructing a replica of his family home in Kosovo while chickens run under their feet and befoul the usually pristine gallery floor.     Trashing taboos ... Ruti Sela and Maayan Amir's video artwork, Beyond Guilt (2003). Image courtesy of the artists    Elsewhere in the biennale, exquisite preparatory sketches by the 19th-century painter and draughtsman Adolph Menzel have been brought together by legendary art historian Michael Fried in the Alte Nationalgalerie. These are small works depicting everything from rumpled beds to soldiers&apos; corpses and that icon of modernity, the bicycle. This section is titled Extreme Realism, yet these drawings are far too impassioned to be taken for a cool slice of reality. Represent the world and you start to shape it, they suggest. This point isn&apos;t lost in a number of the videos that dominate a crumbling multistorey former supermarket in Kreuzberg, which houses the bulk of the biennale. Here politics rule. Marie Voignier films TV presenters quietly holding mics and awaiting their cues amid the media circus of the Josef Fritzl trial. There are YouTube-style toilet confessions in Tel Aviv, in which Ruti Sela and Maayan Amir goad their subjects to say taboo things with the promise of sexual favours. Taking the opposite tack, Bernard Bazile presents point-and-shoot footage of French protestors whose chanting voices are raised in boisterous cacophony. If this is intended as some kind of urgent reality breaking through the gallery, it falls somewhat short of the mark. Presenting images of protest to the average leftie art audience is surely preaching to the choir. Hooray, then, for British artist and former Turner prize nominee Phil Collins, whose new commission for the biennale, Marxism Today (Prologue), delivers his reliable mix of political nous, human insight and humour. This talking-heads documentary features three women who taught Marxism in the GDR, whose frank and funny recollections veer from an impassioned belief in communism to finding meaning in the world of dating agencies. Also memorable is Henrik Olesen&apos;s new work, I Do Not Go to Work Today, I Don&apos;t Think I Go Tomorrow/Machine Assemblage, with every single component of a laptop mounted neatly on Perspex. It&apos;s both creepily obsessive-compulsive and a stark vision of alienated labour. For me, the biennale&apos;s high point is a survey of underground film-maker George Kuchar&apos;s perfectly peculiar work. Shown on multiple TVs in a cavernous garage, it provides a much-needed oddball moment in what could seem a very one-note show. Kuchar&apos;s output of the past several decades initially looks like the obsessive video diaries of an eccentric outsider artist. With basic special effects and accomplished editing, his video sketches weave semi-spontaneous semi-fictions around an American West of beauty salons, motels, drive-thru diners and the artist&apos;s chronic fear of the weather. Camp, balding and in one work troubled by a nasty fungal infection on his feet, Kuchar delivers an examination of the relationship between the self, art and life that finally feels truly visionary.

Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s beaming smile showed an Israeli prime minister confident that he had faced down international protestations over the Israeli attack on the Gaza aid flotilla, buying off the pressure with an inquiry that even the Israeli newspaper, Ha&apos;aretz, described as a farce. For those without crystal balls, Netanyahu helpfully told us that the inquiry will show that Israel took &quot;appropriate defensive actions in accordance with the highest international standards&quot;. Well, it will say that, we can be sure. Is this a rerun of the Widgery inquiry into Bloody Sunday that falsely found that civilians opened fire on British soldiers first? (Israel stated that it was the civilians who attacked first, as if the boarding of the ships never happened). Let us hope that it will not take 38 years to find a Saville, unearth the truth and for someone to apologise for this Bloody Monday massacre as well as others. The inquiry chairman, Jacob Turkel, has stated that holding people to account is a marginal issue. Israeli soldiers will not testify at the inquiry. Would any of the activists co-operate with or trust this kangaroo court? Would an activist beaten up by Israeli soldiers, who has seen their friends and colleagues killed and shot, feel safe going back? Will all their photographs and video footage be released intact after having been illegally confiscated by the Israeli authorities? Israel was very fast to release its own carefully edited selected footage. Turkey has understandably dismissed this inquiry. A valid inquiry requires Turkey&apos;s co-operation to share the findings of the post-mortems into the nine Turkish citizens killed. They reportedly show that one victim was shot five times from less than 45cm. Netanyahu has hand-picked two international observers including Lord Trimble who on the day of the attack on the flotilla was starting a &quot;Friends of Israel initiative&quot;. They will not be allowed to vote on the inquiry&apos;s conclusions. In case of need, the commission can hold closed sessions as it sees fit. Do not expect the inquiry team to be so naive as to produce a report that will totally exonerate Israeli actions. No doubt there will be references to alternatives that should have been used, operational shortcomings, grey areas in international law and lessons to be learned. If Israeli actions were legitimate, and if their soldiers did act properly and legally, then what has Israel to fear? If it wants to restore its image then only a proper international, independent inquiry reporting to the UN security council would suffice. Such an inquiry would have to have full powers making it mandatory on all parties to co-operate including Israel, Turkey and the activists. Any party found responsible for illegal actions should then be held to account. The Israeli record of investigating itself is shockingly poor. Even when the Kahan Commission into the Sabra and Shatila massacres found Ariel Sharon to have &quot;personal responsibility&quot;, he still retained ministerial office in Begin&apos;s cabinet, and before long became foreign minister and ultimately prime minister. The Shamgar commission set up to investigate the massacre of 29 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron in 1994 exonerated both the army and the settler leadership of all responsibility, and recommended the partitioning a site that had been a mosque for nearly 1,400 years. The Landau commission investigating Israeli interrogation techniques, not only took no action but deemed Israel had the right to &quot;use moderate physical pressure&quot; \u2013 torture to the rest of us. It even outlined in a secret part of the report exactly how this should be done. Torture continues today, with recent reports of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy threatened with torture by use of car battery leads on his hands and genitalia. While a UN inquiry into Israel&apos;s assault on Gaza found evidence of potential war crimes and crimes against humanity, the initial Israeli investigation only prosecuted one soldier \u2013 for the use of a stolen credit card. History repeats itself, as it seems a credit card of one of the activists, taken by Israeli security ended up being used in Tel Aviv. Impunity also extends to soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories. The Israeli human rights group, B&apos;Tselem has reported for years on how settlers are never held to account for their crimes. Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a Hebron settler leader, was given a five-month sentence for killing a Palestinian, reduced to only four. While western fatalities attract more attention from the Israeli authorities and international media, justice rarely ensues and the families of Rachel Corrie or Tom Hurndall, both killed by Israeli soldiers, still await the truth of what happened to their loved ones even today. How can a government that uses overwhelming force against civilians, torture, detains children without trial, steals land and resources of another people, demolishes their homes and property, and has violated so many laws and conventions it would be difficult to list them on one page, seriously be expected to hold itself to account? Sadly, British ministers have already welcomed the inquiry despite its shortcomings and lack of independence. Suspicions have been aroused that acceptance of this charade was in return for a cosmetic easing of the blockade of Gaza, and not what is needed, its full and final lifting. The international community, and in particular the United States, never says enough. Like a spoilt child, Israel can do as it pleases. Should we be surprised that Israel uses fake British passports to assassinate people in third countries? The impact of this lack of accountability was highlighted in the report of the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict in 2009 arguing that this only led to further crimes. Stitching up an inquiry will be a Pyrrhic victory for Israel, just as Widgery did not help the British. The blockade of Gaza is unravelling, its barbaric siege and imprisonment of Gaza further exposed to a horrified world, with more flotillas prepared to run the gauntlet of Israeli gunboats and boarding parties. Hamas gets stronger as do more hardline elements in Gaza. Israeli leaders are not asking the right questions. Only a root-and-branch change in their policies and actions towards the Palestinians will bring them both security and international acceptance that they crave. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-06-16T12:33:04Z", "title": "Off the hook: Israel's own Widgery inquiry into Bloody Monday | Chris Doyle", "sentences": ["History repeats itself, as it seems a credit card of one of the activists, taken by Israeli security ended up being used in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/israel-gaza-flotilla-inquiry"}, {"tags": ["Canada", "LGBT rights", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Americas"], "article": "At a time when many countries are becoming more critical of Israel&apos;s policies, Canada seems to be moving in the opposite direction. A general reluctance to engage in open debate about the Palestinian issue is exacerbated by pro-Israel groups&apos; efforts to shut down discussion and the federal government&apos;s unprecedented penchant for defending Israeli actions. Since the beginning of 2010, the federal government has systematically cut funding to Arab-Canadian organisations and to UN relief works in Gaza. In March, the Ontario provincial legislature issued a unanimous condemnation of Israeli Apartheid Week, while the federal government considered introducing a similar motion. However, self-censorship reached new heights last month when Toronto&apos;s Pride Committee \u2013 which organises one of the world&apos;s largest gay pride celebrations \u2013 announced it would be banning use of the term &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; at the festivities. Pride week in Toronto is a loud and highly visible public event, with a long tradition of activists linking their own campaigns for sexual rights to other struggles for liberation and social justice; however, this year the organisers caved in to pressure from pro-Israel groups and Toronto city council. The main effect of the decision is to bar one group in particular \u2013 Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA) \u2013 who have marched in the parade since 2008. The reason given is that the phrase &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; violates Toronto&apos;s anti-discrimination policy. But when asked, neither Pride Toronto nor Giorgio Mammoliti \u2013 the Toronto city councillor mainly involved \u2013 could explain in detail what was discriminatory about describing Israel&apos;s privileging of its Jewish citizens over others as a form or racism and apartheid. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely bizarre the way they are trying to use the language around diversity and inclusiveness to exclude people,&quot; QuAIA activist Tim McCaskell told me. &quot;It was so 1984.&quot; Accompanying the onset of a Canadian McCarthyism dressed up as anti-discrimination, the mainstream left in Canada has been unwilling to take a clear political and moral stance on Palestine. Instead it has sought the approach of least resistance, trying to appease rather than take a stand against the silencing of Palestinian voices in Canada and Israel. Writing in NOW Magazine, a progressive Toronto weekly newspaper, news editor Ellie Kirzner contended that Palestinians and their supporters should simply drop the term &quot;apartheid&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s a vulnerability the movement doesn&apos;t need,&quot; she wrote. McCaskell, on the other hand, says QuAIA is bringing the fight against Israeli apartheid to pride because that is what Palestinian LGBT organisations have requested, and because Israel tries to present itself as queer-tolerant in an attempt to distract from its ill-treatment of Palestinians. The two Palestinian LGBT groups, Aswat and al-Qaws (both based in Israel), issued a joint statement saying: &quot;Pride parades started as political marches, and we firmly believe that solidarity should be with human rights first and foremost.&quot; They continued:  We believe that as queers, one of the most disadvantaged and oppressed minorities in human societies, we should protest against all forms of oppression and struggle together to promote the rights of minorities and oppressed groups. As Palestinian queers, our struggle relates to social injustices caused by the discrimination that is deeply rooted in Israel&apos;s policies and practices against the Palestinian people, straight and gay alike ...Over the past decades, Pride parades around the world have been a platform for queers, not only to increase public awareness for [LGBT] rights, but also a platform to promote and defend causes like the feminist struggle, and the fight to end apartheid in South Africa.  Trying to smother this debate in relation to Israel at Toronto pride could easily backfire, according to Ayala Shani, a queer activist with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. She points out that banning a term will only multiply its use and adds: &quot;We are expecting to see &apos;Israeli apartheid&apos; written and spoken all over pride parades around the world, including a parade in Tel Aviv.&quot; However, with the Canadian mainstream left dodging defence of Palestinians and the country at large continuing its polite silence on the Middle East, Toronto&apos;s establishment may be taking more pride in silencing discussion of Israeli apartheid than even Tel Aviv. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-06-17T10:30:22Z", "title": "Canada: Israel's new defender | Jesse Rosenfeld", "sentences": ["She points out that banning a term will only multiply its use and adds: &quot;We are expecting to see &apos;Israeli apartheid&apos; written and spoken all over pride parades around the world, including a parade in Tel Aviv.&quot; However, with the Canadian mainstream left dodging defence of Palestinians and the country at large continuing its polite silence on the Middle East, Toronto&apos;s establishment may be taking more pride in silencing discussion of Israeli apartheid than even Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/17/canada-support-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "The parents of 43 ultra-Orthodox girls were tonighton their way to prison for two weeks today after defying a court order over their children&apos;s schooling that has highlighted the division between Israel&apos;s religious and secular communities. More than 100,000 ultra-Orthodox men marched through Jerusalem to show their support. &quot;They are going to jail with joy,&quot; said Barry Dubin, 28. &quot;We ultra-Orthodox parents will not cave in to the courts.&quot; The parents are Ashkenazi, originating from Europe, and are in a long-running battle to have their daughters educated separately from Sephardi girls originating from north Africa and the Middle East. They reported to a police station this evening, according to a police spokesman. The mothers and fathers were being sent to separate jails to serve their sentences. Jerusalem&apos;s centre was gridlocked as a result of the march. Police were standing by in the city&apos;s Jewish religious areas last night, the spokesman said. The relative scale of the demonstration, for a city whose Jewish population is half a million, was enormous. Another demonstration in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, attracted thousands more. The reason for wanting separate education, the parents claim, is not racism but a desire to remove their daughters from the influence of those they consider less strict in their religious observance. Watching TV at home, having access to the internet, and a laxer dress code among the Sephardi ultra-Orthodox have been cited. The ultra-Orthodox school in the illegal West Bank settlement of Immanuel segregated the girls, a move that was subject to a legal challenge resulting in an order to reintegrate. The parents of the 43 girls refused to send them back to mixed classes, leading to sentences for contempt of court. Underlying the case is the rejection of what the ultra-Orthodox community&apos;s sees as state interference in their religious practice and life. &quot;We don&apos;t give our girls all the knowledge that there is in the world,&quot; said Esther Bark, 50, a mother of seven daughters watching the male-only demonstration today. &quot;We shelter them, and that&apos;s why they need a sheltered school. We can&apos;t mix a whole assortment of girls in one school.&quot; As police helicopters throbbed over the mass of black-hatted demonstrators, Aaron Shuv, 28, said: &quot;We only follow the rules of God. The Torah [scriptures] is above all government.&quot; The issue had nothing to do with discrimination, said Dubin, a father of two. &quot;No court in the world should have the right to tell me how to educate my sons or daughters. The court went against our rabbis.&quot; Jerusalem&apos;s ultra-Orthodox community has swollen to a third of the Jewish population, assisted by a high birthrate and departure of thousands of secular residents. The secular population is increasingly resentful that its taxes support welfare benefits for the ultra-Orthodox, who reject paid work in favour of religious study. The political leverage of the ultra-Orthodox has also increased since the election resulted in a coalition dependent on the support of small religious parties. &quot;The ultra-Orthodox community is getting stronger and stronger,&quot; said Yitzhak Brudny, a political scientist at Jerusalem&apos;s Hebrew University. &quot;The tensions between the religious and secular communities have become especially pronounced. It&apos;s both a class war and a cultural war. The ultra-Orthodox are dirt poor. Among secular Israelis and moderate Orthodox Jews, they are seen basically as parasites. And they have no desire to integrate with other communities.&quot; Secular Israelis were enraged by the ultra-Orthodox refusal to abide by the law on the schooling issue. &quot;For many years the culture war has hung over us like a dark cloud, like a threat,&quot; Yossi Sarid, a former member of the Knesset, wrote in the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper. &quot;Now it is happening; the war has erupted. The great Haredi [ultra-Orthodox] rebellion has begun and is raging on several fronts \u2026 It will destroy basic values, without which a democratic, developed state cannot exist.

Not content with ruining Saturdays in Jerusalem with fierce protests over a municipal car park, or rallying in defence of a woman who was allegedly starving her own child, they are now back on the streets \u2013 to support racism. A staggering 100,000 ultra-Orthodox \u2013 or Haredi \u2013 protesters demonstrated last week against what they see as unfair prison sentences and state interference in religious affairs. The Israeli supreme court had decided that parents should be jailed after refusing to allow Mizrahi children \u2013 of Middle Eastern origin \u2013 to sit in the same classes as Ashkenazi children \u2013 of European origin \u2013 at a religious school in the occupied West Bank. The Ashkenazi Haredi sector says such divisions are legitimately based upon differences in religious practice \u2013 and it is true that the Sephardi/Mizrahi strain of Judaism is far more lax than its austere Ashkenazi equivalent. The massive outpouring on to the streets in protest at the court&apos;s decision is astonishing \u2013 one of the largest demonstrations in Israel for some time. But in a way, far more galling is the reaction of secular Israel to this latest illiberal outrage from the Haredi sector. There&apos;s journalist and TV presenter Yair Lapid castigating the law-breakers as a &quot;bunch of racists&quot; and opposition leader Tzipi Livni warning about their inconsistency with the state&apos;s values. Also keen to push a view on this is Yossi Sarid, former Knesset member, booming about a &quot;culture war&quot; hanging over Israel &quot;like a dark cloud, like a threat&quot; and again referencing those &quot;basic values without which a democratic, developed state cannot exist&quot;. What hypocrites. The school, which actually divided the kids according to skin colour and raised a wall between them, is not doing anything that the state of Israel has not been practising, more covertly, for generations, under the patronising auspices of its &quot;absorption and assimilation&quot; remit. For decades, Mizrahi Jews have been disadvantaged, disempowered and derided as coming from an inferior Oriental culture that would somehow sink the Jewish state if left uncorrected. Israeli officials openly warned as much \u2013 for instance the former prime minister Abba Eban who, during the 1960s, explained that it should be state policy to infuse Mizrahi Jews with &quot;an occidental spirit, rather than allow them to drag us into an unnatural orientalism&quot;. For decades those Mizrahi Jews have had their accents mocked, their cultures dismissed, their children stunted in downgraded schools \u2013 does that not count as racism? Take a walk through the corridors of a high-achieving school in the northern (Ashkenazi) districts of Tel Aviv and compare that to a school in the city&apos;s Mizrahi-dense southern suburbs, if you think the situation is any more than marginally improved today. Take a look at the latest survey from the Israeli policy analysis centre, Adva, which shows that the wage gap between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi workers has grown wider. Or read Haaretz journalist Gideon Levy, who wrote about this disingenuous Haredi-bashing months ago, for a run down of the many spheres in which colour-coding still prevails. The ultra-Orthodox sector is nothing if not candid in its discrimination and intolerance, while secular Israel pretends to be cured of this devastating ethnic division that has gouged a painful fault line through Israeli society \u2013 one that cannot be remedied because it isn&apos;t even recognised. And how convenient that this issue has instead been dumped wholesale on to the ultra-Orthodox community \u2013 simultaneously the punch-bag and the claimed sole source of tension currently tearing Israel apart. But if secular Israel was so concerned about race inequities, it would long ago have harnessed state institutions to help redress them. That such intervention only happens when it&apos;s in a religious context only shows that this supposed liberal left in Israel doesn&apos;t really hate racism \u2013 it just hates the Haredi. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-06-21T10:30:07Z", "title": "Israel's anti-Haredi hypocrisy | Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["Take a walk through the corridors of a high-achieving school in the northern (Ashkenazi) districts of Tel Aviv and compare that to a school in the city&apos;s Mizrahi-dense southern suburbs, if you think the situation is any more than marginally improved today."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/21/israel-haredi-hypocrisy"}, {"tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "I&apos;m sitting in a restaurant in Jaffa, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, unable to see the food on my plate. I reach for my drink but I can&apos;t find the glass. Clumsily, I put some food in my mouth instead. It feels strange and unidentifiable, some kind of fish perhaps. Around me, I can hear people chattering, but I can&apos;t see them and they can&apos;t see me. I feel helpless, invisible and vulnerable. This restaurant, at the Nalaga&apos;at theatre centre, serves all its meals in complete darkness. I&apos;m relieved when I hear my waitress approach, her soothing voice checking I&apos;m OK. For her, darkness is normal, whether she&apos;s at work or not. Blind since birth, she negotiates the chairs and tables with unstumbling ease. She&apos;s running a half-marathon at the weekend, she tells me, as I struggle to the exit. Nalaga&apos;at (Hebrew for &quot;do touch&quot;) is a remarkable place. As well as the Blackout restaurant, there&apos;s Cafe Kapish, run by deaf waiters. Situated in an old warehouse overlooking the Mediterranean, Nalaga&apos;at is the world&apos;s only professional deaf-blind ensemble. All its actors are deaf and blind, often because of a genetic disorder called Usher syndrome, which results in acute deafness at birth, followed by gradual loss of vision. As a result, most are non-verbal, communicating only through touch. Yet they still manage to make extraordinary theatre, under the eye of company founder Adina Tal, a successful sighted and hearing actor-turned-director. It has been said that Nalaga&apos;at&apos;s show Not By Bread Alone, which arrives in London next month along with simplified versions of the restaurant and cafe, is a test of its audience&apos;s humanity. I think it&apos;s a test of theatre itself: the way good work can communicate across the boundaries of darkness and silence. As actor Itzik Hanuna says in the show: &quot;Welcome to our darkness and silence. We invite you to share our everyday lives together. In the darkness, you may encounter things you would prefer to forget.&quot; In the UK, theatre created by companies of deaf or blind artists seldom reaches a wider audience. But Not By Bread Alone \u2013 a show that lasts as long as it takes the cast to make bread, which is then shared with the audience \u2013 has been playing several nights a week in Jaffa since 2007. Performances are almost always sold out. There&apos;s something deeply touching about this cast of beautiful dreamers: during the show, they remind us that, although they cannot see and hear, we all have the same ambitions and yearnings. The point is that, to really live your life to the full, you cannot live by bread alone. They demand more, both for and of themselves. &quot;People come because it&apos;s a good show, not because coming makes them a good person,&quot; says Tal. &quot;In the beginning, some thought they were doing us a favour by coming. Some people asked if tickets were tax deductible, to which I&apos;d reply, &apos;Is going to the theatre ever tax deductible? No \u2013 so why should this be?&apos; Sometimes they would get angry when they discovered they weren&apos;t doing us a favour but that we were doing them a favour. Even now, some people are embarrassed because they find it difficult to be given a gift by people who are deaf and blind.&quot; Tal was more surprised than anyone to find herself working with deaf-blind actors; she says she is interested in theatre, not social work. At the end of\u00a0the 1990s, she was asked to give workshops to a deaf-blind social group. &quot;I kept saying no but they kept asking, so eventually I went. Nobody could see\u00a0me or hear me. They gave me a coffee and I put it down and somebody stood on it. I couldn&apos;t imagine how we might begin to work together. So we sat in a circle and squeezed hands and tapped knees and tried to find a way of communicating. At every meeting I learned something new, but it was\u00a0frustrating.&quot; Tal wasn&apos;t the only one to find the going tough. &quot;After three months of sitting in a circle, one actor said, &apos;This is stupid \u2013 how can we ever be actors?&apos;&quot; Tal wasn&apos;t sure they could, but another member of the group, Yuri Oshorov, threw down a challenge to her. &quot;He told me he wanted to do Gorky. I said, &apos;You are deaf-blind and non-verbal. How are you going to do Gorky?&apos; He said, &apos;That&apos;s your problem \u2013 you&apos;re the director.&apos;&quot; They didn&apos;t attempt Gorky, but Tal did start them on a piece that would become Nalaga&apos;at&apos;s first show, Light is Heard in Zig Zag, which tried to open up the deaf-blind experience to hearing and seeing audiences. &quot;Other people can do Gorky better than us,&quot; says Tal. &quot;But what they can&apos;t do is what we can do. The strength of Nalaga&apos;at is in being us. That&apos;s what we do really well.&quot; Tal soon discovered that there are some advantages to working with deaf-blind actors. &quot;Because they can&apos;t see each other, they can&apos;t imitate each other. So every action they make is very personal. If you ask them to mime eating grapes, you get 11 entirely different ways of eating grapes. That wouldn&apos;t happen with seeing actors. They can&apos;t be like anyone else. Nobody has ever seen Marlon Brando or Al Pacino act. They can&apos;t copy. That&apos;s why they are great.&quot; It&apos;s also what makes Not By Bread Alone such a compelling, idiosyncratic and joyous theatre experience.

Moishe Rosen was one of the most detested figures in recent decades in some Jewish circles \u2013 for religious reasons rather than for murderous policies. His &quot;crime&quot; was not that he attempted to convert Jews to Christianity \u2013 the church had been doing that for centuries \u2013 but that he added a new and subversive element to the missionary campaign by asserting that those who did so were not reneging on their Jewishness but fulfilling it. It meant that he removed one of the great barriers to any Jewish individual contemplating conversion \u2013 guilt at denying their roots and rejecting their family. He claimed that they could remain Jews, and even become better Jews, by accepting Jesus as the messiah. Rosen&apos;s message was given added potency by the fact that he himself had been an Orthodox Jew, and he could speak from personal experience. He sought to negate the position assumed up till that point by both the Jewish and Christian hierarchy that one had a choice between either Judaism or Christianity. Instead, said Rosen, a person could be both. It was this blurring of the differences between the faiths that so enraged Jewish authorities. Ever since Christianity had begun, it had been recognised that although there was much in common between the two faiths \u2013 notably a shared system of ethics based on the teachings of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible \u2013 there had been one crystal clear division: acceptance or rejection of Jesus. By calling his new movement &quot;Jews for Jesus&quot;, Rosen undermined that distinction. It started in San Francisco in 1973 but spread worldwide, including bases in London and Tel Aviv. It was particularly active on university campuses \u2013 which further annoyed Jewish leaders who regarded it as an attempt to target young Jews away from home when at their most vulnerable. The movement also posed a threat to the efforts at interfaith relations that were still at a relatively early stage then, as one of the key elements was that neither side should use dialogue as a backdoor to conversion. Rosen&apos;s high profile attempts to publicise his cause was not conducive to establishing that trust. The antipathy generated by Jews for Jesus is vastly greater than its success-rate would merit \u2013 it has a mailing list of 200,000, not all of whom are Jewish by birth. What infuriates many, though, is that its adherents still maintain Jewish customs such as observing dietary laws and Jewish festivals as part of their claim to Jewish authenticity. Rosen may have died, but the challenge he posed still looms large : can a Jew who accepts Jesus still claim to be a Jew? This raises the question of why most Jews do not follow Jesus despite the apparent way in which he is claimed to have fulfilled various biblical prophecies. The answer is that, like statistics, biblical verses can be manipulated to suit one&apos;s own purposes, but they are not enough by themselves. Many people, for instance, have been born in Bethlehem (Micah 5.1) or have ridden into Jerusalem on a donkey (Zechariah 9.9) but that did not mean they were the messiah. For Judaism, the litmus test for that title is that on his arrival, peace will descend on the world and a time of universal harmony begin. That is why many Jews prefer to talk about the messianic age, rather than the messiah, emphasising that what is crucial is the era not the person. Peace has not happened and so Jesus failed the test. He was clearly an inspirational preacher, but not the messiah. Of course, Jews for Jesus insist otherwise, and that it is possible to inhabit two religious worlds simultaneously; but for most other Jews, they have crossed a line that makes them good Christians but no longer Jewish.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-23T08:00:21Z", "title": "Did Moishe Rosen die a Jew or a Christian? | Jonathan Romain", "sentences": ["It started in San Francisco in 1973 but spread worldwide, including bases in London and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jun/23/moishe-rosen-jew-jesus"}, {"tags": ["Piracy", "Technology", "Internet", "Sport", "Paywalls", "Media"], "article": "As millions sat glued to their television screens watching the epic Isner-Mahut tennis battle this week, countless others took the opportunity to watch the match illegally over the internet. Thanks to the proliferation of illicit websites offering live streaming of every major sporting event, huge amounts of broadcast revenue are being siphoned out of the world of sports \u2013 threatening the industry in the same way that Napster and Limewire decimated the music business. I watched the final three games of Isner-Mahut via one such feed, and in terms of quality and timing there was no difference whatsoever from watching the game via a conventional, legal TV broadcaster. Gone are the days when low-resolution, high-interruption feeds were the only way to watch pirated sports games: today&apos;s technology makes watching ripped-off streams virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Sport, like music and mainstream media beforehand, has a stark choice before its governing bodies. If they remain resolute in their determination to follow old-school methods of disseminating their product, they will quickly drown under the deluge of fraudsters and pirates all too eager to capitalise on their mistakes. On the other hand, if they realise that they have to adapt to financially survive, they need to move fast to prevent a potentially catastrophic loss of income. In some quarters, sporting bodies are moving with the times. The Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket games are broadcast live and free via YouTube, effectively heading off at the pass any rogue broadcasters seeking to steal their feed for themselves. The IPL authorities have a guaranteed income from their YouTube deal and, with a dedicated millions-strong audience subscribing to their feed, advertisers know how many people they can reach via the stream and how much each commercial slot is worth. Likewise, this year&apos;s Wimbledon can be watched via pay-per-view on the tournament&apos;s official website, although given that this requires significant payment from the consumer, pirate sites still have the upper hand over the organiser&apos;s package. The choice between paying $9.99 (\u00a36.50) for a &quot;day pass&quot; to online Wimbledon or a simple Google search for live, free tennis-streaming is not a hard one for most casual viewers to make, given that they get the exact same product with either option. The malignant symptoms present themselves even more prevalently in the realm of top-tier football. The English Premier League and the Spanish Primera Division are two of the most heavily pirated leagues in the world, and despite the best efforts of regulators the problem is only getting worse with every passing year. Match highlights have been all but lost to copyright infringement, with uploads made by the thousand on YouTube and its peers, and touted on dedicated, legal sites such as 101greatgoals. Live games are increasingly going the same way, thanks to the authorities&apos; refusal to accept that they can&apos;t beat the free-view pirates and should therefore join them instead. Gambling companies have been quick to realise the potential draw of live feeds on their sites, especially in the realm of horse and dog racing, but also in slower-paced, more popular sports such as football and tennis. Betfair and Bet365 offer live broadcasts to punters with active betting accounts, easily reaping back in gambling revenue the outlay made to buy broadcasting rights. Yet with all the signs pointing to a brave new world of online broadcasting, the industry dinosaurs continue plodding along the road to extinction. Premier League enforcers boast of their success in shutting down a handful of illegal feeds, but most online sports piracy goes unpunished. With mobile phones providing yet another alternative to television in the race for audiences, there is even more pressure on rights owners to be proactive rather than simply shut the stable door behind the bolting horse. On anecdotal evidence alone, it is clear that there is a serious problem at the heart of the sports industry&apos;s broadcasting policies. In Tel Aviv, my peers and I watch football in bars with illegal satellites or via pirated internet feeds on laptops hooked up to plasma screens. No one bothers paying for dedicated sports packages when the alternatives are so free and easy, just as huge amounts of people illegally download films and TV series rather than spend money on DVDs. The route chosen by the dogged likes of Rupert Murdoch in demanding money for access to his newspapers and sports packages is doomed to fail as long as there are equally determined rogue operators prepared to keep coming up with illegal alternatives. On the strength of this week&apos;s illegal tennis feed, the pirates have the upper hand; if the industry is to emulate Isner rather than Mahut, their style of play needs to change fast to redress the balance.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T17:00:09Z", "title": "You can't beat the sports TV pirates, so join them | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv, my peers and I watch football in bars with illegal satellites or via pirated internet feeds on laptops hooked up to plasma screens."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/25/tv-sports-pirates-premier-league"}, {"tags": ["Zimbabwe", "Robert Mugabe", "World news", "Angola", "Africa"], "article": "The stakes were high as the sun set in Tel Aviv last week. Seventy international delegates talked long into the night but failed to reach a consensus. At issue: what one campaign group describes as the &quot;return of the blood diamond&quot;. Members of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme were meeting to decide whether Zimbabwe had met its minimum conditions to begin international diamond sales, potentially boosting its fragile economy by at least $1bn a year. Harare insists it has complied with the regulator&apos;s demands for clean trade, citing the recent positive report of a scheme monitor. But civil society groups have urged the delegates to maintain Zimbabwe&apos;s suspension because of human rights abuses in the diamond fields, including the massacre of hundreds of illegal diggers. Rights groups say soldiers in Marange are still engaging in forced labour, torture and harassment. The calls have intensified since the arrest and imprisonment of Farai Maguwu, a whistleblower who has been monitoring alleged abuses, reportedly after members of his family were beaten and detained. There are also fears that profits from gem exports could be used to bankroll President Robert Mugabe&apos;s cash-strapped Zanu-PF party at the expense of its rival-in-government, the Movement for Democratic Change. Civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s brought to global attention how rough diamonds, used by rebel movements to finance wars against governments, could end up in jewellery shops in London and New York. The issue was dramatised in the film Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Ten years ago, a UN resolution launched the Kimberley process, a joint initiative by governments, the diamond industry \u2013 including De Beers \u2013 and advocacy groups to choke off illicit sales. The safeguards came into effect in 2003 and are claimed to have reduced conflict diamonds from 15% to a fraction of 1% of international trade. But illegal diamond sales remain a huge concern in countries such as Venezuela, Ivory Coast, Guinea and Lebanon. Last year seven campaign groups issued a joint statement warning that the scheme was &quot;failing to address effectively issues of non-compliance, smuggling, money laundering and human rights abuses in the world&apos;s alluvial diamond fields&quot;. Two of the scheme&apos;s leading figures have quit. Elly Harrowell, a campaigner at Global Witness, which helped set up the scheme, said recently: &quot;Ten years on, is the KP a success or a failure? The process has definitely had some impressive successes in the last 10 years, but unfortunately we would say, in the last few years, a lack of political will has jeopardised the progress.&quot; She added: &quot;This could be a make or break year for the Kimberley process.&quot; A higher-level meeting will follow in Jerusalem in November. Pressure groups say Zimbabwe is now an acid test of its credibility. &quot;The Kimberley Process risks total irrelevance if it ignores these ongoing abuses,&quot; said Rona Peligal, acting Africa director at Human Rights Watch. &quot;If the Kimberley Process can&apos;t take real action on an issue like Zimbabwe, then what is it good for?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-06-26T23:04:21Z", "title": "Zimbabwe: Spectre of 'blood diamond' returns as Harare seeks go-ahead for gem sales", "sentences": ["The stakes were high as the sun set in Tel Aviv last week."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/27/zimbabwe-blood-diamond-human-rights"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Human rights", "Civil liberties - international", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Despite government claims to the contrary, Israel&apos;s borders are far from impenetrable to residents of the occupied Palestinian territories. The separation wall is only 60% complete, numerous ways to circumvent checkpoints exist throughout the West Bank, and poorly patrolled perimeters provide any would-be terrorist with ample opportunity for security breaches. It is an open secret that thousands of Palestinian labourers illegally cross into Israel every day seeking casual work, yet if Israel&apos;s hawkish right is to believed, the only thing preventing a new wave of suicide attacks is an iron-fist policy towards Palestinians&apos; freedom of movement. Such a wilful distortion of reality is behind the scandalous police investigation of Ilana Hammerman, an Israeli journalist facing prosecution for violating the &quot;law of entry into Israel&quot;. Hammerman&apos;s crime was to take three Palestinian girls on a day-trip to Tel Aviv, in an act of civil disobedience intended to highlight the injustice of Israel&apos;s military occupation of the West Bank. In a moving article for Haaretz, she wrote of their fraught experience avoiding detection at the hands of border guards and police as she ferried her quarry around the sights of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Even though they lived a mere hour&apos;s drive away from the coast, the girls had never once seen the sea nor walked the streets of Israel&apos;s largest city, thanks to the heavy restrictions imposed by the IDF. Hammerman openly acknowledges her awareness of breaking the law, seemingly prepared for the consequences of admitting to her deeds in public: &quot;I did not do this in rash defiance, but rather after much thought. Out of a need, that has become ever more pressing in the last years, to raise certain essential issues for in-depth public discussion in Israeli society&quot;. In her eyes, her own liberty is worth sacrificing if it assists in the struggle to bring freedom to the millions of Palestinians held captive in their West Bank cantons. Her bold actions have, inevitably, incurred the wrath of groups on the Israeli right, including the Legal Forum for the Land of Israel (LFLI) \u2013 an organisation founded to fight for settler rights during the 2005 disengagement. LFLI filed a formal complaint with Israel&apos;s attorney general, calling for Hammerman to be prosecuted for her violation of the law, beginning a process which could result in her spending up to two years in jail. According to LFLI director general Nachi Eyal, a prominent figure in the settler movement, &quot;she wanted everyone to know that you can take Palestinians in against the law and lie to police officers and the army. I want to send a message that no citizen in Israel can take the law into his hands and if he does they have to pay&quot;. Hammerman is an easy and convenient target for the likes of Nachi, despite her crimes paling by comparison to the countless Israeli businesses employing Palestinians illegally on a daily basis, including employers within West Bank settlements. For others, Hammerman&apos;s defiant gesture is a laudable stand against the Israeli government&apos;s inequitable policies. One Israeli activist working with Palestinian youth in the south Hebron hills describes her as &quot;one of the great Israelis of our time&quot; for her tireless campaigning, with others rallying support for her cause via NGO networks across the country. Should the Israeli police take the bait and haul Hammerman over the coals for her actions, she will become another martyr in the vein of Ezra Nawi, whose heavy-handed treatment by the courts galvanised activists on the Israeli left who were horrified at the political bias displayed by the domestic authorities. Prosecuting Hammerman for her tame and harmless violations will only reinforce such a view, and will do nothing to protect the security of Israeli citizens in the process. The likes of Hammerman and Nawi are vital in the fight to foster contact and communication between ordinary civilians on either side of the Israel-Palestine divide, and their work prevents even more hatred and mistrust being fostered towards Israelis than currently exists. However, portraying them as traitors and self-haters is the preferred tactic of the Israeli right, who believe that divisive, discriminatory policies are the one and only way to safeguard Jewish rights in Israel. That their tactics have failed for years is of scant importance to those at the helm of the Israeli government. Fomenting tension and discord has left Israelis in constant danger for decades, but to Netanyahu and his merry men, robbing Palestinians of their rights to give succour to ultra-nationalist Israelis can never be bettered as a modus operandi. Flies in the ointment like Hammerman are a minor inconvenience, but no match for the clout and conviction of the hardline elements backing Israeli irredentism at home and abroad. Whatever happens to Hammerman, there needs to be a serious re-evaluation of Palestinian rights in both the West Bank and Gaza, as much for Israelis&apos; wellbeing as that of their Palestinian neighbours. Highlighting the unfairness of three girls&apos; caged existences is a vital way to raise Israeli awareness, but unless it sparks a nationwide debate it will fail to come close to achieving its goals. The tragedy of the Israel-Palestine imbroglio is that so few Israelis realise how counterproductive their government&apos;s policies are, but with activists like Hammerman refusing to stay silent, there is still hope that the blinkers will fall from the public&apos;s eyes before it is too late. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-06-28T10:34:45Z", "title": "A Tel Aviv day-trip shouldn't be a crime | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Hammerman&apos;s crime was to take three Palestinian girls on a day-trip to Tel Aviv, in an act of civil disobedience intended to highlight the injustice of Israel&apos;s military occupation of the West Bank.", "In a moving article for Haaretz, she wrote of their fraught experience avoiding detection at the hands of border guards and police as she ferried her quarry around the sights of Tel Aviv and Jaffa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/28/tel-aviv-day-trip-crime-ilana-hammerman"}, {"tags": ["Social networking", "Sex", "Social trends", "Relationships", "Grindr"], "article": "Ever heard of Grindr? If you have, I&apos;m going to guess that you are male and gay; or male, technically straight and somewhat curious; or the straight friend of a gay man. If not, allow me to enlighten you. Grindr (pronounced &quot;grinder&quot;) is a free downloadable iPhone app which, it promises, will help you &quot;Find gay, bi, curious guys for free near you!&quot; Grindr harnesses GPS, allowing you to establish who else in your direct vicinity is also using Grindr. It shows you \u2013 on a gridded display \u2013 who these men are and what they look like; it&apos;ll tell you how far away from you (in feet, and even more thrillingly, fractions of feet) they are standing; and it will allow you to &quot;chat&quot; them, if they take your fancy. Although buried deep in the Grindr ethos is the idea that you shouldn&apos;t do in cyberspace what you could be easily be doing in person. Don&apos;t &quot;chat&quot; when you could actually, you know, chat. Grinding is an intoxicating experience. I was first introduced to it on the roof terrace of a bar in east London by my friends J and W. J launched the app on his iPhone and I got palpitations as the grid of portraits (ordered in terms of geographical proximity \u2013 your nearest Grindr user is posted at the top left) instantly unfurled itself across the screen. All these men, effectively coming on to \u2013 well, not me, but still\u2026 It is literally a sexy app and the overflow of that sexual potency, the decadence, sweeps you along on a wave of lust, regardless of who you are and what your gender or sexual orientation might be. I was reminded of the first time I entered words into the search criteria on Google, of the first time I downloaded music from iTunes \u2013 I knew I was engaging with a bit of technology that would alter things on a profound level. I scrolled on and on through the grid of gay offerings, furtively trying to match the pixelated images with the real-life men ranged around me in the bar. &quot;But do you want to know the funny thing?&quot; J said. &quot;The best nights you can have on Grindr are the nights when you stay in.&quot; And he laughed, wickedly. Grindr is reconfiguring the landscape of human relationships. Partly because it&apos;s sex in an app, the sexual equivalent of ordering take-away, or online fashion (my friend Kevin calls it &quot;net-a-port-gay.com&quot;, and he&apos;s so pleased with himself for this he says I can use his real name. Everyone else asked to remain anonymous). Grindr was launched on 25 March 2009; now more than 700,000 (and counting) men in 162 countries around the world are using it to phenomenal effect, if J, W, Kevin and the other gay men I&apos;ve asked are any kind of a guide. &quot;I&apos;ve never, ever had so much sex in my life!&quot; R told me gleefully. &quot;I&apos;ve probably had as much in the past eight months of Grinding as I have over the 20 years since I came out. Maybe more.&quot; It&apos;s only going to get bigger, to facilitate more sex. Two thousand people download it every day, and a BlackBerry-friendly version of the app launched less than a month ago \u2013 a development which could triple Grindr&apos;s reach. But Grindr is more significant even than that suggests. It marks a major evolution in how all of us \u2013 gay, straight, alive \u2013 will meet and interact with each other. Depending on who you talk to, this is either brilliant (liberating, socially enabling \u2013 the end, even, of loneliness and boredom); or a potential disaster (signalling the end of monogamy, facilitating sex addiction). Either way, it matters. Arguably we are living in a post-gay era. The divide between gay and straight worlds diminishes daily. Gay culture and straight culture become increasingly intertwined. For example, Grindr&apos;s biggest boost occurred in June 2009, after gay icon Stephen Fry told the boorishly straight Jeremy Clarkson all about it during an interview on super-hetero TV show Top Gear. So Grindr would matter even if it was not in the process of developing a straight version of its sexy self. But it is. It is likely that the Grindr experience will be open to a straight market by the end of 2010. &quot;Oh, at the very latest,&quot; says Joel Simkhai, the founder of Grindr. He&apos;s a wiry, neatly handsome 33-year-old man with an American accent, a hectic manner and a sharp business edge. I meet him for coffee in a chic hotel in London. This is where he&apos;s basing himself while he checks out Grindr&apos;s flourishing UK market; he usually lives in Los Angeles. &quot;The UK is the second biggest country for Grindr after the US,&quot; he tells me. &quot;London is the third biggest city after New York and LA. You love us.&quot; Simkhai was born in Tel Aviv and he and his parents moved to New York (&quot;State, not the city&quot;) when he was three. He came out in his mid-teens &quot;just as AOL was taking off. I was born \u2013 gay-born \u2013 with online. And that was a huge help to me in terms of meeting people \u2013 people who unfortunately were a ways away in Wyoming or wherever \u2013 but still, I was meeting people who were gay and who weren&apos;t freaks.&quot; But Simkhai says he still felt isolated as a young gay teenager. He found himself asking: &quot;The question. I think every gay man starts asking it, from the moment he realises he&apos;s gay. You are somewhere and it&apos;s: &apos;Who else here, right now, is gay? Who?&apos; You are looking around, you are constantly wondering. Because coming out is a lonely process.&quot; Still? &quot;Yes! Very much so! And every gay man who asks himself that question also thinks: &apos;Wouldn&apos;t it be good if there was some way for me to tell? Some way for me to know?&apos; Every gay man has had the idea for Grindr.&quot; Nearly two decades later, after Simkhai had finished a degree in international relations and economics and worked for some years in finance, Apple launched its second-generation iPhone. &quot;It was almost as if someone was handing Grindr to me on a silver platter. The first iPhone didn&apos;t have GPS, and it only had about eight apps. They were all Apple apps, too \u2013 you couldn&apos;t develop your own. It really wasn&apos;t that great a device. But in the same announcement of the second-generation phone, they said: &apos;This phone will have GPS and now you can create apps!&apos; I was like: &apos;Wait a minute! I know an app I want to do!&apos;&quot;\u00a0 Did he have a complete notion of what he wanted from Grindr? How it would work, what it would look like, what sort of commotion it would create? &quot;Ha! No. My notion was use GPS, see who else is near. Simple as that.&quot; In August 2008, Simkhai contacted Morten Bek Ditlevsen, an app developer based in Denmark. &quot;He had a passion for GPS, just as I did. He&apos;s straight, but he liked the idea; he had a full-time job, but he said: &apos;Yeah, I&apos;ll do this as a hobby.&apos; Didn&apos;t ask for much money.&quot; Simkhai brought another friend, &quot;Scott Lewallen, an expert in branding, marketing and design&quot;, into the fold. Both still work on Grindr. It took Simkhai, Bek Ditlevsen and Lewallen six months and $5,000 to build Grindr. About the name: where did it come from? &quot;Nowhere specific. We liked the word. We liked the notion of a coffee grinder, mixing things together\u2026 And there&apos;s the term &apos;guy finder&apos; in there, too. We wanted something that was masculine but was not about pride flags. Was not about\u2026&quot; A politicised idea of gayness? &quot;Yes! And was fun! And was in a way \u2013 not about being gay. I&apos;m gay; I am a proud gay man. It&apos;s not that we have any issues, right? But Grindr&apos;s not about gay rights, or gay anything. It&apos;s about finding guys. Being among your peers. Socialising. Being part of your community. It&apos;s not about: &apos;We&apos;re here, we&apos;re queer.&apos;&quot; So Grindr launched in spring 2009. For the first few months uptake was steady but modest. Then Stephen Fry showed it to Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear &quot;and 40,000 men had downloaded it within a week. Amazing.&quot; Simkhai talks with great passion about his creation. He builds a beautiful case for Grindr. He trumpets its international, unifying aspect, making it sound like the United Nations of gayness. &quot;Here we are, 8,000 miles from home and we have 50,000 guys here in London. How? What? I haven&apos;t been here for 10 years \u2013 the first thing I did when I landed at Heathrow was launch Grindr! Sydney. Melbourne. Singapore. Tokyo! Tokyo is our fourth largest city, one of our top cities! I&apos;ve never been to Japan! I don&apos;t speak Japanese!&quot; He points out that Grindr is a response to online dating, which causes as many problems as it solves. &quot;With missed connections and back and forth, and: &apos;Oh actually, this week I&apos;m in New York, and you&apos;re in LA\u2026&apos; Online dating is frustrating! It is a lot of work!&quot; Grindr, on the other hand, is immediate. There is no messing about, no toing and froing, no building up your hopes via weeks of emails only to discover on your first physical date that you just don&apos;t fancy whoever in the flesh. You see someone&apos;s picture on Grindr, you meet immediately, you establish whether or not you&apos;re attracted to each other: &quot;Grindr reintroduces the aspect of chemistry. And \u2013 it&apos;s real. It is not a Second Life. It is not a virtual world. It&apos;s a tool. It enables real life, it doesn&apos;t replace it.&quot; And it leads, I say, to very real sex. None of this virtual nonsense. Simkhai pauses. &quot;Er\u2026 From my perspective\u2026 it&apos;s not sex. It&apos;s a precursor to sex. It&apos;s just before. That&apos;s how I see Grindr. We want to be sexy. We think sex is part of life, the basis of life. But Grindr is sexiness rather than sex.&quot; Simkhai is concerned, perhaps, about the conservative elements of the US media. Editorials on the danger of the &quot;new gay hook-up app&quot; pop up periodically. Simkhai is keen to make the point that Grindr is not uniquely concerned with procuring sex. &quot;I meet guys all the time who say to me: &apos;I know it&apos;s for hooking up, but\u2026 &apos; But they met some really good friends. But they met their boyfriend. But. But.&quot; Simkhai says his main hope for Grindr is it will help young gay men through the process of coming out. I am moved by Simkhai&apos;s passion, by the tales of the non-sexual impact of Grindr. I appreciate that it is still not easy to come out, and how important that sense of geographical proximity, of being part of a visible and accepting community, would be. The David Laws story breaks a fortnight after I interview Simkhai; a high-profile, sad piece of evidence that gay men still encounter problems in making their sexuality public. Yet the men I speak to tell me Grindr is all about sex. &quot;Internet&apos;s for dating; Grindr&apos;s for sex,&quot; D tells me. &quot;Well, sometimes the internet&apos;s for sex, too, but Grindr: definitely sex.&quot; I ask around and am inundated with Grindr stories, all of which end in a sexual encounter. &quot;Sometimes you don&apos;t really fancy them , but\u2026&quot; There&apos;s a sense of obligation to have sex anyway? &quot;Yeah. But that&apos;s OK.&quot; I begin to develop an idea of the culture that surrounds it. Many gay men see Grindr as a way to round off an evening. &quot;I&apos;d had dinner at a friend&apos;s house in west London and I was walking back to the tube; thought I&apos;d launch Grindr, see what was going on. This guy pops up and chats me: &apos;You&apos;re near!&apos; I chat back: &apos;I know\u2026 &apos; He says: &apos;I&apos;m here with my boyfriend. Come and see us.&apos; So\u2026 I did.&quot;\u00a0 Others use it as you might a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day. Kev lives near a major station: &quot;And so I get a lot of literal traffic. Men get off the train on Sunday night after a weekend somewhere stifling, probably with their parents; they launch Grindr \u2013 guess who pops up first?&quot; It&apos;s mixing formerly segregated elements of gay society. My 30- and 40-something gay male friends tell me they&apos;re having much more to do with younger gay men: &quot;Which is weird, and yeah, sometimes not totally comfortable, if you think about it,&quot; says one. &quot;You have to work out what&apos;s too young for you and stick to that limit. But \u2013 you&apos;re always honest about who you are. You&apos;ve got to be. You can&apos;t say you&apos;re younger or hotter than you are; you can&apos;t post someone else&apos;s photo. If you lie you&apos;re just going to get found out, and that pisses people off, obviously. Lying isn&apos;t done on Grindr.&quot; Cheating, on the other hand, definitely is. &quot;You always see on Grindr: &apos;Oh, I&apos;ve got a boyfriend \u2013 just interested in chatting!&apos;&quot; says Matthew Todd, editor of gay lifestyle magazine Attitude. &quot;Oh really? Why? Why do you need to chat to people? Why do you need to be on Grindr? Call your mum up!&quot; A gay man who is in a long-term relationship tells me he&apos;s aware of Grindr, but is choosing not to try it. &quot;It would change everything. I&apos;m very tempted, of course I am! But ultimately I don&apos;t want to go there, and I don&apos;t want my boyfriend F to go there either.&quot; &quot;The vast majority of guys on Grindr are in a relationship,&quot; says P. &quot;And I reckon a quarter of the guys who use it are straight. Not curious or bi or whatever. Straight.&quot; &quot;The straight ones are all talk!&quot; says D. &quot;They love the idea that sex with a stranger could be that easy, could be downloaded on their phone\u2026 But when it comes to it, they won&apos;t do anything.&quot; Not every gay man is enamoured of Grindr. Attitude&apos;s Matthew Todd has reservations. &quot;A friend with an iPhone showed me it about a year ago and said: &apos;Can you believe it?&apos; I rolled my eyes and thought: &apos;There is no way of stopping this.&apos; Find any new technology \u2013 we will always bring it back to sex.&quot; Todd&apos;s used it (&quot;I dip in and out&quot;) and he knows from feedback that Attitude&apos;s readers are using it a great deal. &quot;I think it&apos;s good for people to be able to connect. Especially young people. It&apos;s good to be able to see that there are other gay people around, and to be able to interact. But at the same time I think it&apos;s a very adult world. The commercial gay world \u2013 which Grindr is part of \u2013 is a very adult, very sexual world. And I worry when I see these young kids coming out on to the gay scene, and everything is about sex. There&apos;s no real concept of relationships.&quot; Others condemn it more directly. &quot;Grindr&apos;s addictive,&quot; writes one man \u2013 the ex-boyfriend of a close friend \u2013 by email. &quot;Grindr and Gaydar [the UK&apos;s biggest gay dating site]\u2026 A lot of gay men have addiction issues. I feel crap even writing it, but there it is. We drink, we use drugs and we use sex to overcome the shame we feel. And we feel worse because we know we shouldn&apos;t feel shame, we should feel pride \u2013 so we abuse drugs and sex more. Things like Grindr and Gaydar enable that sort of sex, sex which is compulsive and which dehumanises you; and means you in turn dehumanise the people you are having sex with.&quot; He puts me in touch with G, a man he met while seeking treatment for sex addiction. &quot;I&apos;ve lost entire weekends to sex,&quot; writes G. &quot;Downloading porn, going on Grindr, meeting men whose names I don&apos;t find out, having sex; downloading more porn\u2026&quot; &quot;Low self-esteem,&quot; says Todd. &quot;I see it a lot in gay men \u2013 it&apos;s inevitable after years of repression and shame. And what&apos;s better for self-esteem than someone having sex with you?&quot; Could Grindr work for a straight market? There is, I think, an undeniable gender divide on the things that men and women will do for sex, and the things they expect and want from sex. Yes, women are capable of having inconsequential flings. We are capable of one-night stands. We are capable of having sex without becoming emotionally involved. FitFinder \u2013 which allowed undergraduate users to post descriptions of people they&apos;d seen and fancied on their university-dedicated website \u2013 became extremely popular earlier this spring, before university authorities banned it, which would suggest that there is a straight market for a location-specific dating concept. But I&apos;m not sure Grindr could fully accommodate the complexities of male-female interactions. The gender politics, the power games, the ebb and flow of interest, the tedious but totally authentic need most men feel to pursue a potential sexual conquest\u2026 I ask a handful of straight women \u2013 some single, some not \u2013 if they think they might be interested in a Grindr equivalent; they say they can just about envisage it working, although none of them would commit to the notion of using it themselves. The straight men I poll say they&apos;d think less of any woman who &quot;advertised herself like that&quot; \u2013 and then all insisted on downloading gay Grindr on to their phones, &quot;just to see how it works&quot;. If anyone can make and sell a straight Grindr, Simkhai can. He does concede: &quot;I&apos;m a gay man and I know how to think like a gay man\u2026 actually, my sense is I know how to think like a man. I&apos;m not a woman. I don&apos;t know how to think like a woman.&quot; Yet he says he gets more requests for a straight Grindr from women than he does from straight men. &quot;Many more. Which might be because straight women are often friends with gay men, so know about Grindr\u2026 But I do think it would be relevant for women. I do.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;We&apos;ll redesign it; we&apos;ll call it something different, market it differently. We have to. Gay men are very territorial. They want to keep it all to themselves, but they say: &apos;If you have to make a straight version, call it something else. Grindr is ours.&apos;&quot; I am still sceptical, but then Simkhai says: &quot;This notion of: &apos;Who is around me? Who is in this room now? Who else is like me?&apos; \u2013 this is not just a gay thing. And this thing where: &apos;I want a more fulfilling life. A richer life!&apos; This is not just a gay thing either. Gay men don&apos;t have the monopoly on loneliness and isolation.&quot; He is right, of course. As I say goodbye to Joel Simkhai, I find myself thinking: however straight Grindr plays out for us \u2013 even if it opens up a Pandora&apos;s box on our sexuality, alters forever the way men and women relate, leaves us vulnerable to a whole new world of emotional and sexual complications \u2013 bring it on.

It is a controversial place for Poles, who come here to rant about whether there really should be this much garlic in the baba ghanoush. The Islingtonisation of the Polish capital is almost complete, and yesterday&apos;s presidential election is the strongest indication yet. With 95% of votes counted, the liberal Bronislaw Komorowski, on 52.6%, defeated his conservative rival Jaroslaw Kaczynski&apos;s 47.4%. The data is less important than the fact there was no vitriol in this campaign, which showed a general shift to the centre. Nobody predicted that Kaczynski would do so well. His short-lived, paranoid and aggressive coalition government (which included two bizarre fringe parties) was destroyed in Poland&apos;s 2007 general election. It seemed Kaczynski&apos;s popularity would never recover, and he trailed in polls for most of this year. However, since his late brother&apos;s tragic death on 10 April, Kaczynski convinced voters he is a changed man. Kaczynski has always been strongly pro-Jewish, especially since personal friends had to leave Poland in 1968, during an antisemitic purge masterminded by the communists. Aside from that single subject, he has been willing to flip-flop from one populist issue to another in bids for power. His recent tactics took the biscuit. When Kaczynski&apos;s campaigners used John Lennon&apos;s hippie anthem I laughed so hard that I fell off my chair \u2013 then realised the image makeover could win it for him. The all-new friendly Kaczynski said nice things to Germans, Russians and even the Polish left (whose rising star Grzegorz Napieralski had done well in the first round). Finally, Kaczynski even praised one of Poland&apos;s communist dictators, Edward Gierek, to woo the few Poles who still think a command economy run by a bunch of corrupt, useless idiots is a good idea. I nearly expected Kaczynski to endorse Europride Warsaw 2010 and explain his views on homosexuality had been caused by Frank Fitts syndrome all along. For being nice, Kaczynski was rewarded by the electorate: he missed the presidency by around just 200,000 votes, an achievement nobody would have predicted two months ago. More importantly, he has reasserted his leadership of the Law and Justice party right in time for the 2011 parliamentary elections. These are what matter more in Polish politics, because they create governments, whereas the presidency is more of a symbolic role, which comes with a veto that can block parliamentary bills. Really, this election was a referendum on the governing Civic Platform&apos;s aim to move closer to the EU and accelerate market-oriented reforms, which will be endorsed by Komorowski. Kaczynski would have used presidential powers to block government bills, to keep the EU at arm&apos;s length, defend public sector jobs and maintain the welfare state. Almost half of Poles want the latter. Kaczynski and his Law and Justice party are socialists on economic matters. The working-class electorate who chose Kaczynski yesterday were voting for the Polish equivalent of Old Labour policy, not rightwing, firebrand rhetoric. Living standards in big cities such as Warsaw and Krakow are still a world apart from the subsistence farms of the south-east and the rundown estates of mid-sized towns. Poland&apos;s workers, especially those who lost in the transition from communism, have legitimate concerns that Civic Platform austerity will make life tougher than it already is. They will continue to have a voice, while Kaczynski and Napieralski are listening.

Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, revived tensions when his strongly worded comments were reported by the Hurriyet newspaper and picked up in Israel and across the Arab world. &quot;Israelis have three options,&quot; he said. &quot;They will either apologise or acknowledge an international, impartial inquiry and its conclusion. Otherwise, our diplomatic ties will be cut off.&quot; Ankara withdrew its ambassador from Tel Aviv after the flotilla raid on 31 May, when nine Turks were killed by Israeli commandos who boarded the Mavi Marmara. But this is the first time Turkey has explicitly threatened to cut off ties completely. Turkey also cancelled joint military exercises with Israel and banned some Israeli military flights from using Turkish airspace \u2013 though Davutoglu called this &quot;a blanket ban&quot;. Israel has refused to participate in an international inquiry into the raid, instead launching its own investigation. It has also refused to apologise. &quot;Israel cannot apologise because its soldiers had to defend themselves to avoid being lynched by a crowd,&quot; its prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said on Friday. &quot;We showed them an exit road,&quot; said the Turkish foreign minister today. &quot;If they apologise as a result of their own investigation&apos;s conclusion, that would be fine for us. But of course we first have to see it.&quot; Davutoglu&apos;s warning came as something of a surprise since it followed an apparent thaw between the two countries when he held a meeting in Brussels last week with Israel&apos;s trade minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. The meeting was itself the subject of a political row in Israel after news of the so-called secret session leaked out. Ben-Eliezer subsequently threatened to &quot;kebab&quot; an aide to Ehud Barak, the Israeli Labour party leader and defence minister, for briefing journalists against him. Barak revealed today that he had rejected a proposal for a meeting with Davutoglu while both men were visiting Washington two weeks ago. The US has been urging Turkey and Israel to patch up their quarrel. Barak said he believed that since the proposal was intended to &quot;clarify the Turkish position and make claims against us, such as demanding an international investigation, compensation and so forth, I did not think it was right to hold the meeting&quot;. He told the Knesset&apos;s foreign affairs and defence committee that he expected the Gaza blockade to be challenged by more aid ships, including one being organised from Lebanon. The naval blockade, he insisted, would remain in force, even as import restrictions were eased. Turkey, a Nato member and a secular but Muslim state, was once Israel&apos;s closest ally in the Middle East but has reoriented its foreign policy towards closer ties with Iran, Syria and the Arab world, partly because it has been rebuffed over its old dream of joining the EU.

For decades, successive Israeli governments have persisted in their obstinate policies in the West Bank to the detriment of civilians on both sides, despite knowing full well that no lasting peace deal can ever be reached without an end to the settlement enterprise. Although the settlements are deemed illegal under international law, Israeli officials continue to cling to their belief that Israel has every right to settle its citizens in expropriated land over the Green Line. One line of argument employed by settlement supporters is that no settlement is built on private Palestinian land \u2013 though such a claim appears to be based largely on settler fiction rather than hard facts. According to a new report by the Israeli human rights group, B&apos;Tselem, over a fifth of built-up settlement areas are constructed on privately owned Palestinian land, giving the lie to the assertions of settler leaders that their actions are entirely above board. B&apos;Tselem&apos;s figures are based on official government records which reveal a state-wide complicity in the wholesale violations of local and international law \u2013 and the deception has been going on for years. When sanctioning early settlement construction in the West Bank, the report says:   &quot;the principal means Israel used ... was declaration of &apos;state land&apos;, a mechanism that resulted in the seizure of more than 900,000 dunams of land (16% of the West Bank), with most of the declarations being made in 1979-1992. The interpretation that the State Attorney&apos;s Office gave to the concept &apos;state land&apos; in the Ottoman Land Law contradicted explicit statutory provisions and judgments of the Mandatory Supreme Court. Without this distorted interpretation, Israel would not have been able to allocate such extensive areas of land for the settlements.&quot;  When I interviewed prominent figures in the settler movement for my book on Israeli settlements, I was met time and again with the declaration that settlements are &quot;more legitimate&quot; than major Israeli coastal cities, in a paradoxical interpretation of Israeli law. &quot;In Haifa and Tel Aviv, they took over Arab property. But the settler movement wasn&apos;t allowed to touch private property&quot;, said Daniella Weiss, mayor of the Kedumim settlement and a long-time settler figurehead. &quot;One of the backbones of the settler movement, according to the guidance of Rabbi Kook, was that we could only build on rocks \u2013 not on people&apos;s private land \u2026 Now as there was a lot of rocky land, the settlers, including me, settled on the rocks,&quot; she explained as she recalled the founding of Kedumim in the mid-1970s. From rocks to riches, the settlement enterprise has covered vast amounts of ground in the succeeding years with people like Daniella at the helm. However, somewhere along the line the guidance of Rabbi Kook has gone unheeded, because according to official Israeli Civil Administration data obtained by B&apos;Tselem, 21% of built-up land in the settlements is private, mostly Palestinian land, while in Kedumim itself that figure is over twice as high, according to Peace Now figures. If Daniella Weiss was aware of this fact, she chose not to mention it. It is a similar story across the West Bank, with scores of other settlements built illegally with government approval, and the crimes compounded by continued state assistance to those residing within the illicit communities. One such settlement is Ma&apos;on, in the South Hebron Hills, where buildings have been constructed without permission, with civil administration data revealing that 15% of the settlement is built on private, mostly Palestinian, land. Similarly, the settlement&apos;s outpost, Havat Ma&apos;on, which is illegal even according to Israeli law, is not only built without permission, but also extends on to private Palestinian land, with all the resulting hardships on the local Palestinians that such encroachment brings. According to Israel&apos;s Road Map commitments, the outpost is supposed to have been demolished, and yet it continues to be supplied with water, electricity and defence by the Israeli authorities. Moreover, even if the government was inclined to evacuate the outpost as it is committed to do, evacuations in the past have simply resulted in the transfer of the population to other West Bank settlements in the Occupied Territories. There is little point in expecting the settlers themselves to up and leave their cushy, state-subsidised homes as long as there is no official pressure on them to do so. A dogged and dogmatic commitment to illegal settling of the West Bank is the nature of the settler beast: to expect a volte face to come from within the settler community is wildly unrealistic. Instead, the onus is on the Israeli government to pull the rug from beneath the settlers&apos; feet, in order to demonstrate serious commitment to the peace process and to prove to the Palestinians that Israel is prepared to make painful concessions in the name of ending the conflict. While it is all well and good for Israelis to demand an end to Palestinian violence and sabre-rattling, there has to be goodwill shown from the Israeli side too \u2013 and no amount of words can speak as loudly as the action of a large-scale pull-out from West Bank settlements. Without such a step forward, the region is doomed to forever stagnate in a cycle of stalled road maps and failed efforts, and there will be no peace for both the wicked and good alike, on either side of the divide.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-06T08:00:45Z", "title": "Settlements are a blockade to peace | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["&quot;In Haifa and Tel Aviv, they took over Arab property."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/06/israel-settlement-west-bank-palestinian"}, {"tags": ["US news", "Obama administration", "World news", "Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The advance word was that this was to be a &quot;holding meeting&quot; and not much more. Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu would not launch some grand initiative for the Middle East. Instead they would sit together, chat chummily and pose for photographers \u2013 particularly important given what happened a couple of months back, when an angry Obama kept Bibi waiting for hours in the West Wing, only to cut their meeting short without so much as posing for a souvenir snap. Accordingly, today&apos;s summit was all warm hugs and making nice. Obama spoke of the &quot;special bond&quot; between the two nations \u2013 even if there did have to be the occasional &quot;robust discussion&quot;. Bibi nodded, adding that disagreements were what you got in a close &quot;family&quot; relationship like this one. Reports of any strain between them were &quot;flat wrong&quot;, and to prove it Bibi invited the Obamas to Israel; Michelle showed Sara round the White House; and reporters were kept waiting during a long Bibi-Obama lunch, surely proof that the two men just couldn&apos;t get enough of each other. For all that, the advance billing of a holding meeting was not so far off the mark. The US president was certainly in no rush to make waves: he is four months away from midterm elections, in which support for Israel threatens to become an issue, at least in the handful of states where Jewish voters might make a difference. In several congressional contests Republicans are making mischief over the administration&apos;s recent relative firmness towards Israel, with one candidate accusing Obama of &quot;browbeating&quot; the Jewish state, while others suggest the Democratic administration is fraying the historic ties that have bound the two countries. Small wonder, then, that Obama was and remains keen to be all smiles with Bibi \u2013 at least until polling day on 2 November. The Israeli PM does not face imminent elections, but he too has been happy to go along with a strategy of pause and delay. For Netanyahu inaction is always preferable to action: only a demand for tricky concessions \u2013 say an extension of the current, partial moratorium on settlement building in the West Bank \u2013 might imperil his fragile coalition, by prompting the ultra-hawkish parties to bolt. So long as the Americans are not asking anything of him, Bibi can stay comfortably in his seat. There is a larger explanation for why the prime minister might be fond of stasis and inertia. The operating assumption held by both him and the nationalist right he leads is that Israel has time on its side. This is a belief deeply ingrained, one that draws sustenance from a century of Zionist history. The first Jewish settlers in Palestine pushed the boundaries of the possible, establishing themselves in places that initially seemed insanely ambitious, only for time to reward their daring. The Jews accepted a UN partition plan in 1947 that gave them 56% of Palestine, only to see their share leap to 78% by the end of the war of 1948-9. Playing the long game has worked before and, the Israeli right assumes, it will work again. You can see why Bibi would be drawn to such thinking. Each day that passes entrenches the Israeli presence in the West Bank. Consider that there were no Jewish settlers in 1967, around 120,000 in 1994 and more than 300,000 now \u2013 those numbers alone, which exclude East Jerusalem, constitute a powerful argument for playing it long, letting time change the facts on the ground until they are unalterable. Besides, what&apos;s the urgency? The Israeli economy is ticking along nicely, defying the global trends; the beachside cafes are full; Tel Aviv is even becoming the hot destination for gay tourism. Why risk change when the status quo is so tolerable? And yet the underlying assumption is almost certainly wrong. Israel does not have time on its side. On the contrary, time is running out fast. Israel is surrounded by evidence that it is, in the words of one Ha&apos;aretz columnist, &quot;hurtling down the slippery slope of pariahdom&quot;.  The Gaza flotilla episode exposed that fact most starkly, as Israel found itself isolated diplomatically, chastised by those it normally relies on as friends. First among those has always been the US. Israel has long been able to depend on rock-solid support from a Washington that saw merit in a loyal, semi-dependent state in a region that was unreliable at best and hostile at worst. But now that calculus has been shaken. Note the 54 Congressmen who issued a statement rebuking Israel over the flotilla. Note the paper by Anthony Cordesman, a fixture of the US foreign policy establishment, asking if Israel has become a &quot;strategic liability&quot; for America. Note too the comments of David Petraeus, now Nato commander in Afghanistan, warning that Israeli intransigence was adversely affecting US interests in the Middle East. This adds up to a new climate of opinion in which Obama can afford to be firm with Netanyahu because he knows he is not alone. The second source of previously iron support has been the mainstream Jewish diaspora, especially in the US. For decades, the official voices of American Jewry have uttered only words of unity and support; criticism was confined to the fringes. But now that too is changing. The institutional manifestation has been J Street, which in three short years has signed up some 100,000 supporters for its alternative to the dogmatic Israel-right-or-wrong stance of American Israel Public Affairs Committee. A key recent text is an essay by Peter Beinart that appeared in the New York Review of Books, castigating the US Jewish leadership for failing to condemn the ever-rightward drift of Israeli policy. Of course there is nothing new about Jewish opponents of Israel: they are older than the country itself. But what makes these interventions different is that they come from those who are avowedly Israel&apos;s friends. J Street&apos;s slogan is that it is &quot;pro-Israel, pro-peace&quot;; Beinart is a former editor of the staunchly Zionist New Republic. There are echoes outside the United States, too. In Europe, JCall, an online petition, has rapidly attracted the signatures of those who have previously devoted themselves to public defences of Israel, including the French glamour-intellectuals Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and Alain Finkielkraut. Even the head of Britain&apos;s biggest pro-Israel charity last month insisted on the right of diaspora Jews to speak out, and bemoaned the lack of a peace strategy from the Israeli government. It is this that should shatter any Israeli complacency. For these are stirrings from deep within the pro-Zionist mainstream. They cannot be dismissed as the words of implacable enemies of Israel or the Jews; they are palpably nothing of the sort. Nor can they be ignored. Beinart&apos;s essay began with survey evidence showing young American-Jewish youth alienated and remote from Israel, with many expressing &quot;a near-total absence of positive feelings&quot;. That sentence should strike fear into all those looking to Israel&apos;s long-term future. Until now, the chief long-range concern of the Israeli right was demographic, the fear that eventually Israel would rule over more Arabs than Jews, given the combined populations of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Now they have another concern: &quot;delegitimisation&quot;, what they perceive as a global campaign to ostracise, or boycott, Israel, until it is banished from the family of nations. It is undeniable that Israel has bitter enemies. But the longer the occupation endures, the more Israel risks losing its friends. Netanyahu has to realise that Israel does not have time on its side: it needs to end this conflict \u2013 and with the utmost urgency.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-06T20:06:45Z", "title": "Israel has never lacked enemies but now it risks losing its friends | Jonathan Freedland", "sentences": ["The Israeli economy is ticking along nicely, defying the global trends; the beachside cafes are full; Tel Aviv is even becoming the hot destination for gay tourism."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/06/israel-losing-friends-netanyahu-obama"}, {"tags": ["Zimbabwe", "War crimes", "Liberia", "Robert Mugabe", "Human rights", "Mining", "World news", "Blood diamonds", "Africa"], "article": "Blood diamonds will flood back into the world ma illerket unless a way is found to bring Zimbabwe back under global control at a key meeting next week, according to one of the world&apos;s biggest diamond tycoons. Willie Nagel, founding father of the Kimberley Process \u2013 a group made up of government, human rights and diamond industry officials to prevent the trading of diamonds that could be used for financing wars \u2013 has warned that Zimbabwe is not adhering to the &quot;clean trade&quot; system. He said unless the country was swiftly bought back into the international fold, it would destabilise the market by saturating the world with non-approved diamonds. Harare insists it has complied with Kimberley&apos;s demands. It points to a recent positive report from the regulator&apos;s monitors. But human rights groups say abuses continue to take place in the Marange diamond fields. They cite the massacre of hundreds of illegal diggers and say soldiers are still engaging in forced labour, torture and harassment. There are also fears that profits from the industry could be used to fund President Robert Mugabe&apos;s cash-strapped Zanu-PF party at the expense of the Movement for Democratic Change. Zimbabwe&apos;s minister of mines and mining development, Obert Moses Mpofu, has said that his country plans to begin selling diamonds from the Marange immediately, regardless of whether the Kimberley Process gives its approval next week. If fully mined, diamonds could make up 25% of the global supply. Nagel said that Zimbabwe&apos;s &quot;continued refusal to conform [to the system] will undermine the Kimberley Process and destabilise the whole market&quot;. It could, he said, lead to the US \u2013 the largest diamond market in the world \u2013 banning all imported stones, with EU countries following suit. At a meeting in St Petersburg next week, the World Diamond Council (WDC) will try to establish whether Zimbabwe has met Kimberley&apos;s minimum standards. Its decision will be guided by Boaz Hirsch, the current chair of the Kimberley Process, who will be the keynote speaker. Nagel is asking delegates not to repeat the failure of last month, when international diamond experts meeting in Tel Aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether Zimbabwe&apos;s government was profiting from the diamonds while engaging in human rights abuses. &quot;We risk upsetting the whole fabric of Kimberley because the find of diamonds in Zimbabwe is such a major one,&quot; said Nagel. &quot;If they begin smuggling their diamonds out to the rest of the world, it would be disastrous: for us and for them. If Zimbabwe don&apos;t conform, sooner or later the USA may not allow diamonds in at all. If we can&apos;t sell to the ultimate consumer if diamonds, we&apos;re lost.&quot; Despite the success of the Kimberley Process, blood diamonds are still used to fund human rights abuses. The model Naomi Campbell and actor Mia Farrow have been ordered to testify in court about the gift of blood diamonds Campbell allegedly received from Charles Taylor, former president of Liberia. Taylor is accused of having been paid in rough diamonds for weapons to arm the rebels in Sierra Leone&apos;s bloody civil war. Concerns over abuses in Zimbabwe are so acute that the European parliament today passed a resolution critical of Mugabe and his supporters for plundering diamonds for their own benefit.The resolution called for the &quot;revision of the Kimberley Process to take proper account of human rights principles&quot; and for the Zimbabwe government to use diamond revenue to help regenerate the economy as a whole. Eli Izhakoff, the WDC&apos;s chairman, said the WDC meeting next week will &quot;reconfirm our commitment to ethical trading and to the eradication of conflict diamonds from our distribution chain&quot;. &quot;We will not be assembling in St Petersburg simply to pay lip service to the values upon which the organisation was founded,&quot; he added. &quot;The ongoing situation in Zimbabwe and the dedication of our industry to operate in a transparent and principled manner means that there are burning issues on the table, which we will discuss and for which we will formulate strategies.&quot; What is the Kimberley Process?", "publicationDate": "2010-07-08T15:48:46Z", "title": "Blood diamonds from Zimbabwe to flood international market, watchdog warns", "sentences": ["Nagel is asking delegates not to repeat the failure of last month, when international diamond experts meeting in Tel Aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether Zimbabwe&apos;s government was profiting from the diamonds while engaging in human rights abuses."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/08/zimbambwe-blood-diamonds-abuse"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Turkey", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza flotilla", "Europe"], "article": "Israel must lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip and be &quot;held accountable&quot; for its attack on a ship carrying aid to the Palestinian territory, Turkey&apos;s foreign minister has said.

Davutoglu did not repeat a warning earlier this week that Turkey would sever its diplomatic relations with Israel but warned of &quot;gradual stages&quot; of disengagement if did not respond to Ankara&apos;s demands over the &quot;freedom flotilla&quot; affair.

Across the valley is Jerusalem&apos;s zoo, which his grandchildren have never been able to visit, although they have watched animals through binoculars. Below is the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv railway, also never travelled by the Bargouth family. Its route here marks the Green line, drawn after Israeli and Arab armies agreed an armistice in 1949, when Bargouth was aged two, which placed most of the original village of Al Walaja out of the reach of its Palestinian owners. A cluster of Israeli houses stand on land owned, inhabited and farmed by the Bargouth family and other villagers. Behind Bargouth is the Jewish settlement of Har Gilo, built \u2013 illegally under international law \u2013 on occupied Palestinian territory and fast encroaching on what remains of the diminished village. And in front of Bargouth&apos;s garden, planted with figs, plums, grapes and pomegranates, is an ugly scar of raw flattened earth where Israel is erecting a section of its separation barrier that will encircle the village and cut off farmers from fields, students from places of learning and patients from hospitals. The original route of the barrier \u2013 which Israel says is necessary for security reasons \u2013 would have cut Al Walaja in two. The community launched a legal petition to keep the village intact, which was granted \u2013 with the catch that the revised route, announced in April 2006, would completely encage the village. Al Walaja would become a tiny Palestinian enclave connected to the nearest West Bank town by one road or tunnel controlled by a checkpoint. This spring the bulldozers arrived. To Bargouth&apos;s dismay and anger, the barrier \u2013 which he expects to be a concrete base topped by a fence \u2013 will run through his land a few metres from his house. To create the required 100 metre-wide strip of restricted ground for the barrier&apos;s route, the Israeli military uprooted 88 of Bargouth&apos;s olive trees. &quot;Some were 180 years old, some were new trees,&quot; he said. The military offered to replant the trees, but Bargouth refused to be complicit in the action. &quot;They had no right to uproot my trees. Why should I tell them where to replant them?&quot; More than 80% of Bargouth&apos;s land will be on the other side of the barrier. Going by the experience of other West Bank farmers cut off from their land by the barrier, he expects at best extremely limited access. The future, he says, is bleak. &quot;There will be no other source of income. We are decent people, we work hard. My children and grandchildren will look at the wall in front of us and know they have stolen our land.&quot; But it is not only future generations that Bargouth is concerned about. Just below his terraces of fruit trees lies the family cemetery where his parents and his grandmother are buried. It is directly in the path of the barrier. &quot;I went to court to get an order, preventing them touching the tombs,&quot; he said. A hearing later this month will decide on which side of the barrier the graves will end up. &quot;Not only are the living suffering, but also the dead. Why should I need a permit to visit the graves of my parents?&quot; According to the UNRWA, the United Nations body that deals with Palestinian refugees, around 70% of Al Walaja&apos;s land was lost in the 1948 war. Then, following the six-day war in 1967, nearly half the remaining land was annexed by Israel and placed under the expanded Jerusalem borders. In the 1970s more land was confiscated for Jewish settlements. Now even more land is being taken to construct the barrier. Half the village is now part of Jerusalem; the other half part of the West Bank. But because almost no villagers hold Jerusalem residency permits, they have no legal basis to live in \u2013 or even cross into \u2013 the &quot;Jerusalem&quot; side of the village. Dozens of people have been arrested over the years. It also means they cannot get permission to build. Forty-five unauthorised homes were demolished between 1985 and 2005, and another 45 have pending demolition orders. Earlier this year, after a lull in orders, two more families received notice that their homes were scheduled for demolition. The main source of income for Al Walaja&apos;s 2,040 inhabitants \u2013 nearly all registered refugees from 1948 \u2013 is agriculture. UNRWA is deeply concerned that farmers will be prevented from planting and harvesting crops and grazing sheep and goats on land on other side of the encircling barrier. There are no health facilities in the village, and older children go to school in nearby Beit Jala or Bethlehem. No one knows whether continuous access in or out of the village will be allowed once the barrier is complete. Al Walaja has been the focus in recent months of protests against the barrier involving villagers and Israeli and international activists. Bargouth hopes there will be more, despite the stiff military presence containing demonstrators. But, he believes, non-violent protest may not be enough to save his and others&apos; land. &quot;The occupation must be resisted by all methods, from demonstrations to the gun,&quot; he says. Symbol of peace Alongside its bleak past, Al Walaja has another historical claim \u2013 one that, thankfully, has so far escaped the political traumas of the past seven decades. Down a steep stony track and behind a padlocked gate stands what is thought to be the world&apos;s oldest olive tree. Dated variously at 5,000 and 7,000 years old, the tree&apos;s magnificent knotted and interweaving trunks and abundant leaves are tended daily by Salah Abu Ali, 38, whose family owns the land. When a natural spring which irrigated the tree dried up a few years ago, it stopped producing its annual harvest of half a ton of olives, says Abu Ali. But for two years he has watered the tree by hand and has been rewarded by the appearance of new branches. &quot;It has a promising future,&quot; he says. The olive branch is an international symbol of peace.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-08T18:39:20Z", "title": "Palestinians face being walled by Israeli security barrier", "sentences": ["Below is the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv railway, also never travelled by the Bargouth family."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/08/palestinians-israeli-security-barrier"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "An academic backlash has erupted in Israel over proposed new laws, backed by the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, to criminalise a handful of Israeli professors who openly support a campaign against the continuing occupation of the West Bank. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel has gained rapid international support since Israeli troops stormed a Gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in May, killing nine activists. Israeli attention has focused on the small number of activists, particularly in the country&apos;s universities, who have openly supported an academic boycott of Israeli institutions. A protest petition has been signed by 500 academics, including two former education ministers, following recent comments by Israel&apos;s education minister, Gideon Saar, that the government intends to take action against the boycott&apos;s supporters. A proposed bill introduced into the Israeli parliament \u2013 the Knesset \u2013 would outlaw boycotts and penalise their supporters. Individuals who initiated, encouraged or provided support or information for any boycott or divestment action would be made to pay damages to the companies affected. Foreign nationals involved in boycott activity would be banned from entering Israel for 10 years, and any &quot;foreign state entity&quot; engaged in such activity would be liable to pay damages. Saar last week described the petition as hysterical and an attempt to silence contrary opinions. While the vast majority of the signatories do not support an academic boycott of Israel, they have joined forces over what they regard as the latest assault on freedom of expression in Israel. The petition states: &quot;We have different and varied opinions about solving the difficult problems facing Israel, but there is one thing we are agreed on \u2013 freedom of expression and academic freedom are the very lifeblood of the academic system.&quot; Daniel Gutwein, a history professor at Haifa University who is one of the signatories, described the minister&apos;s intervention as an attempt &quot;to make Israeli academia docile, frightened and silent&quot;. Although the BDS campaign \u2013 in various forms \u2013 has been running for over half a decade, it has become an increasingly fraught issue inside Israel in the past year since a small number of academics publicly declared support for a boycott, including Neve Gordon, author of Israel&apos;s Occupation and a former paratrooper who was badly injured while serving with the Israeli Defence Force. Speaking to the Observer last week, Gordon said that many Israelis saw support for the BDS as &quot;crossing a red line&quot;. Adding that he had received recent death threats, he said: &quot;I am worried about what is happening to the space for debate in Israel. I find that there is a proto-fascist mindset developing. One of the slogans you hear a lot now is no citizenship without loyalty. It is an inversion of the republican idea that the state should be loyal to the citizen.&quot; Israeli campaigners believe the Gaza flotilla incident represents a tipping point in raising support for boycotts. Musicians including Elvis Costello, Gil Scott Heron and the Pixies have cancelled shows in Israel. Hollywood actors also snubbed Jerusalem&apos;s international film festival and internationally acclaimed writers have supported the BDS movement, which is gaining support in dozens of countries. &quot;It&apos;s a different world to what it was even a month ago,&quot; says Kobi Snitz, member of an Israeli BDS group. &quot;Suddenly, all sorts of people are supporting it \u2013 people that you wouldn&apos;t expect.&quot; What is most interesting, however, has been the impact in Israel itself. Israeli journalist and blogger Noam Sheizaf wrote recently that such actions are now forcing Israelis &quot;to think about the political issues and about their consequences\u2026 For a country in a constant state of denial regarding the occupation, this is no small thing.&quot; Sheizaf does not promote the boycott, but says: &quot;I will gladly return concert tickets if that is the price for making Israelis understand that the occupation cannot go on.&quot; Adi Oz, culture editor on the Tel Aviv weekly Ha&apos;ir, appeared on Israeli national radio explaining her support for recent boycott activity. &quot;When the Pixies cancelled their concert here I was disappointed,&quot; she says. &quot;But I was not critical of the Pixies, I was critical of our government, because they are responsible for Israel&apos;s isolation.&quot; She adds that, post-flotilla, the cultural boycott is &quot;something that everyone has a stand on \u2013 and some people are realising that they are in favour of it, without having thought about it before.&quot; There has also been a spate of boycott-related discussion in the financial press. The daily business newspaper Calcalist ran an uncritical profile of the Israeli campaigners behind Who Profits, an online database of Israeli and international companies involved in the occupation of the West Bank. The project&apos;s co-ordinator, Dalit Baum, of the Coalition of Women for Peace, says: &quot;Every day there is an article about this issue in the Israeli media, which creates a discussion about the economy of the occupation and raises the fact that there&apos;s a problem.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-07-10T23:05:44Z", "title": "Israeli academics hit back over bid to pass law that would criminalise them", "sentences": ["Israeli journalist and blogger Noam Sheizaf wrote recently that such actions are now forcing Israelis &quot;to think about the political issues and about their consequences\u2026 For a country in a constant state of denial regarding the occupation, this is no small thing.&quot; Sheizaf does not promote the boycott, but says: &quot;I will gladly return concert tickets if that is the price for making Israelis understand that the occupation cannot go on.&quot; Adi Oz, culture editor on the Tel Aviv weekly Ha&apos;ir, appeared on Israeli national radio explaining her support for recent boycott activity."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/11/israel-academics-bds-boycott"}, {"tags": ["Life and style", "Young people", "Relationships", "Family", "Secondary schools"], "article": "I thought he was going to tickle me to death. The ultimate humiliation. Bristles \u2013 so called because of his bog-brush hair \u2013 was big and clumsy and looked hard as hell. But he was an overgrown softy. He wouldn&apos;t have punched me, or kicked me, or nutted me, but here he was on top of me, knees across my knees, me unable to breathe, laughing hysterically, snorting my last, thinking what a terrible way to go. Armpits, belly, armpits, armpits. I was a big enough lad, but he was so much bigger. I couldn&apos;t have got up if I&apos;d tried. But the trouble was I knew I wouldn&apos;t try. I&apos;d just let it happen. Why? Why not spring up and lamp him? He wouldn&apos;t do that again. I had a history of passivity. At the open-air school they sent me to after three years off school with encephalitis, a boy four years older than me and half my size, with a cleft lip like a third-degree burn and terrible speech defect, used to walk up to me every breaktime and slap me across the face. Again and again. I knew I just needed to hit him the once. But I couldn&apos;t. It was my role in life to stand there and take it \u2013 to show my bravery by not crying. We called the open-air school the &quot;mong school.&quot; Well, it was the 70s, and everything was mongtastic back then. Top mong, mad mong, supermong. The thing about the open-air school was that there really were mongs there \u2013 that&apos;s what we called kids with Down&apos;s syndrome. So in the one class, there&apos;s kids in wheelchairs, kids with autism (we just knew them as nutters), asthmatics, juvenile delinquents on probation. As Bristles tickled me with murderous intent, I thought back to the way they&apos;d burned me with fags and put my head down the toilet and kicked the crap out of me. If I&apos;d survived that, I&apos;d survive Bristles. I didn&apos;t only survive Crumpsall Open Air for Mongs, I thrived. The older boys, the real toughies, started to look out for me after a while. It was when I went in goal that everything changed \u2013 every break, diving on gravel, bloodying my knees, keeping the ball out. That&apos;s when they accepted me. After a year I left for Kersal High. I resented Kersal, felt it was soft. The stupid thing was I didn&apos;t have a clue how to handle myself, and it was actually one of the hardest schools in Salford. All I knew was that I could take a beating. It never struck me to learn how to give one out. At Kersal, they could call me Jew boy, and Jeff or Kirk or Trevor could chase me round the playground trying to hit me with a metal crossbar, but it didn&apos;t impress me. I messed around like crazy that year. Before illness I&apos;d been such a swot, and so bright. But loads of the brain cells seemed to have died off. So I&apos;d talk in class, stick pins on the French teacher&apos;s seat, draw willies on my desk in chalk, help tie the physics teacher Mr Clunk Kearney to the desk with crocodile clips. Mum cried when I took home my first report. &quot;Simon has adapted remarkably quickly to being back in school,&quot; wrote Mr Pexton. &quot;So much so that he has established himself as the class fool.&quot; Bastard. Mum took it personally. She always did. We&apos;d been close enough, all along, but somehow the illness changed everything. She had been the one who stood by me when everyone said there was nothing wrong with me, and I was just attention seeking. Now it was like we were umbilically tied. If something upset me, she&apos;d be the one to cry. I knew I could never get another report like that. I owed Mum, and that was no way to pay her back. I don&apos;t think I made a conscious decision to start working. It just happened that way. Mum and Dad spoiled me a bit after I was ill. They&apos;d expected me to die, and when I didn&apos;t I don&apos;t think they ever stopped being grateful. Which meant that they gave me more money than most kids my age got. I&apos;m not talking hundreds of pounds, not even 20s. But what it did mean was money for records. Records were my big thing. I had a bigger and better collection than anybody I knew, until I met Steve, but that&apos;s another story. Albums mainly: from glam rock to prog rock to punk rock. One day I&apos;d be out buying Yes Songs with its triple gatefold sleeve, the next I&apos;d be forking out \u00a34.99 for Roxy Music&apos;s Country life \u2013 I loved Ferry&apos;s voice, the sax and synth, but best of all was the picture of two models on the cover with their see-through knickers and cloud of pubes. Once or twice a week after school I&apos;d take the 95 or 96 into town to wait outside HMV for a record that was out that day, or pay a leisurely visit to the Virgin shop. HMV was smart and corporate: new albums glistened through the shop window in their polythene sleeves. The Virgin, further uptown, was one of Richard Branson&apos;s first shops, and wasn&apos;t much more than a tiny living room with a till, a desk and two booths. It smelt of spliff and was run by two guys with hair down to their bottoms who had all the time in the world to hang, and chat. I was 13, and must have been the youngest boy in there, but they never made me feel it. Every week I devoured Melody Maker, NME, Sounds, Record Mirror and Disc, in that order. On the way home, I&apos;d pop into Thorntons if I had any money left and buy a couple of vanilla truffles. My favourite album of all time was the Floyd&apos;s Dark Side of the Moon. It was perfect because it was about brain damage and the evil of capitalism and voices in your head, and all the things I knew about. I much preferred this to the crappy singer-songwriter stuff about love. I didn&apos;t understand all the fuss about love. In the third year, which was my second year, I started to work. I loved humanities and English and maths, and even French began to make a kind of sense. That summer my school report was great. I was still cheeky, but now I was laughing more with teachers than at them. There were friends as well. David had become my best mate, and he was one of the hardest boys in our year. It was never a conscious decision to hook up with the toughies, but there does seem to be something horribly parasitic about it. I don&apos;t think I was ever happier than these years. I&apos;d open the window in the morning, and the world smelt so fresh. Grass, rain, roses, petrol, everything smelt so specific. At breaktime, we&apos;d rush out and play football. I played out of goal now, liked to think of myself as a midfield general. I would count every goal I scored. But these weren&apos;t proper games, they were kickabouts. And when I did get a chance to play for a proper team, I blew it. It&apos;s funny how I always looked so in control, so unbothered. But I wasn&apos;t. For hours before a match I&apos;d be on the toilet. By the time I got on to the pitch I&apos;d be so nervous I couldn&apos;t talk. An inept centre-back with uncertainty written into my DNA, I scored a hat-trick of own goals in one match \u2013 one of them a bobbler from the halfway line. Back at school the following week, I&apos;d morph into the midfield general. How I cursed my nerves, and relived every moment of abject failure. They seemed such innocent times. And they were, in some ways. There was no technology to speak of. If we were meeting up we&apos;d knock on doors or arrange it at school and on a good day confirm on the phone. At times my teens seemed like an extended Persil ad \u2013 in the park, dirty top, Mum washing it, teatime. And yet amid the normality, and the innocence, there were so many diversions into irreversible adulthood, so many everyday weirdnesses. By the fifth year, when we were doing O-levels, a number of girls simply disappeared from school and reappeared a few weeks later, noticeably lighter if somewhat drawn. It always seemed to be the same boy getting them pregnant. I was too busy discovering the joys of solitary sex to get anybody pregnant. I didn&apos;t know how to ask girls out. It was so much easier to say funny things and feign indifference. I told myself if a girl really wanted me she&apos;d make the first move, and if she didn&apos;t want me she didn&apos;t deserve me. I remember asking a girl to dance at summer school when I was 13, and the way she said no thanks and laughed in a way that wasn&apos;t entirely cruel. But it left its mark. At 15, I had my first experience of caressing a girl&apos;s shoulder in the dark, wondering why her nipples didn&apos;t go hard and why it didn&apos;t make me come. All those things I was expected to know. Shortly after that there was the first proper girlfriend, however brief. Her older brother, Steve, who ran the local youth group and was 21 years old, told me she wanted me to ask her out. So I did. And we did. Back then, you didn&apos;t need elaborate social network sites to meet paedophiles: it turned out Steve was into drugs, rock&apos;n&apos;roll and teenage boys. He was small and weaselly, a garden gnome with a foot that never stopped tapping. He had hilarious mottos such as &quot;keep it stiff&quot; and &quot;how&apos;s your penis?&quot; It was a privilege to be chosen to be Steve&apos;s friend. The first time he asked me back to his house was to see his record collection \u2013 thousands of albums, immaculately catalogued, beautifully preserved. Not many people could give me an education in music, but he could. It was on an away trip with the youth club that he introduced me to drugs. Nothing much. A bit of spliff. I didn&apos;t think it was up to much, until it started to make me laugh. &quot;Inhale properly,&quot; he said, &quot;suck it in.&quot; So I did. And when I felt sick he took me to my room to look after me. He undressed me and played with me in a way that I didn&apos;t want. And I just lay there silent, embarrassed, ashamed, thinking if you&apos;re going to do this, at least do it properly. He persisted for years, but always treated it as a joke. He&apos;d tuck his hands into my pants. &quot;How&apos;s your penis?&quot; he&apos;d say. It would have been so much more honest of him to admit he enjoyed it or it excited him, but then again it would have been so much more honest if I&apos;d told him to fuck off. One night I did. It was late, and my parents were asleep and he was up to the old tricks. I screamed at him to stop and told him to leave. I don&apos;t think I saw him after that. Decades later, after the death of my father, Mum told me that Dad had called him into his office at work and threatened to report him to the police if he didn&apos;t leave town. I felt so proud of him \u2013 it was the kind of heroic act I never associated Dad with. Time sped up so much in those years. Was I 15, 16, even 17? It was a hormonal rollercoaster, emotional highs followed by emotional lows a second later. Everything sexual seemed so unlikely, so heightened, and brief. The aches and angsts and smells of first love \u2013 or lust \u2013 were exhilarating and bewildering. A late-night walk along a Tel Aviv beach ended with me losing my virginity. Possibly. I don&apos;t know. I couldn&apos;t tell. All I knew was that she was a stranger, it was hot, and we were naked and thrusting, and it felt like sex. Would it always be like this? With strangers, and ending with a gentle kiss like a handshake, and going our separate ways as if nothing had happened. At 16, we left school. There was no sixth form. I passed all eight O-levels, which was a considerable feat at Kersal. I had started to feel smart and able again, for the first time since before I was ill. I adored my four years there. I had friends, I felt loved and secure. Loved by pupils and teachers: wonderful Mrs Beatty, our form teacher, who terrified all her colleagues and would fight to the end for any of her kids; Mrs B, who took David and me to the pub on drama outings and downed Guinness and whisky chasers. And Turdie, Speaky Scho-ee, Smithy, Baggy, Ned, Gobbo, where are you all now? On the last day we signed each other&apos;s shirts with love. No irony, no sarcasm, just love. I kept the shirt for years in my bedroom wardrobe. Wish I had it now. Some of us went to college, some got apprenticeships and some went on the dole. But few of us had plans. I thought of myself as unambitious \u2013 I didn&apos;t have any idea what I wanted to do with my life \u2013 but it wasn&apos;t true, I was fiercely ambitious in my own way. I would have loved to have kept my nerve and played in the proper football team. I was desperate to do well in my exams. What we didn&apos;t have was plans \u2013 we were a meandering generation. I never understood it when Dad, who always seemed so old, said nothing remains the same. I&apos;d been alive 16 years and everything had stayed the same. Yes there were strikes and power cuts, and the rubbish built up on the streets, but there were no wars, banks didn&apos;t go bankrupt, shops were still shops and Woolies was for ever. We didn&apos;t have a clue what was around the corner in terms of the digital revolution, the internet and the virtual world. Everything had stayed the same. But of course it didn&apos;t, in the end. Nearly all those landmarks of my teenage years have gone: Maine Road, where I watched Manchester City fail, and then fail better; the Priory, where we drank and saw United&apos;s generation of boozers; Kersal, which was closed as a failing school and rebuilt as flats. Crumpsall Open Air is also flats now. We changed, too, usually without realising. When Mum asked if I wanted to do A-levels at the sixth-form college or Bury grammar school I don&apos;t remember giving an answer, but sure enough, on the first day of the new school year, I had a new school uniform and a long bus trip ahead of me. It was so boyish and privileged and soft. I don&apos;t remember much about Bury, apart from the last day: the way the English teacher insisted TS Eliot&apos;s The Waste Land was an optimistic poem; the way I said it seemed depressing. The way he said it again, illustrating it with points, his teeth tightening by the sentence. &quot;See, it&apos;s optimistic.&quot; &quot;Well, I think it&apos;s pessimistic.&quot; &quot;Look, listen, for Christ&apos;s sake . . . this is why it&apos;s a hopeful poem.&quot; &quot;Not in my book.&quot; &quot;Jesus, you&apos;re an obstreperous bastard, Hattenstone.&quot; In all my years at Kersal no teacher had sworn at me, let alone called me by my last name. I walked out, straight to the headmaster&apos;s office. I took off my tie and ripped my shirt in front of him (at least, I think I did \u2013 maybe I&apos;m romanticising my rebellion) and told him I didn&apos;t want anything more to do with his school. Despite my eight good O-levels, it wasn&apos;t easy finding another place to go. The trouble was that although I had announced I was the one leaving, the head expelled me. And the words of a headteacher carry more weight than a 16-year-old obstreperous bastard. Confidence is such a fickle thing \u2013 it takes years to build, seconds to lose. By the time I rejoined my mates at Eccles sixth form, it felt as if years had passed. In fact, it was only half a term. But things seemed different. I felt my two closest friends had locked me out \u2013 that they resented me for having chosen Bury over them. Everything was going wrong. John Lennon died. At college we wore black armbands and were briefly reunited in grief. Today, teenagers measure their popularity by hits or followers on social network sites. Back in 1980, it was all nuance. It might not have been as cod-scientific, but it was equally brutal. I was 17, should have been embracing all these great new freedoms and experiences, and yet I was drowning in an existential mulch of my own making. I was consumed by an abstract terror. A terror of being exposed. I&apos;d decided I was a fake and was just waiting for others to pick up on it. The fears were irrational, and numerous. Would I be exposed for being thick, or fancying her or her, for not being funny, for being miserable, for having a face that refused to smile, for being jealous of others&apos; success or happiness, for not wanting to be here, or anywhere? One blush would give it all away, and the whole edifice would collapse. Fucking teens. I couldn&apos;t catch up with the work. Now they&apos;d realise I was thick. So I started to drink. Not casually, really drink to numb me. One day I stole \u00a32.50 from Dad&apos;s chest of drawers and bought a quarter bottle of gin from the off-licence across the field from college. Then I walked back into the field and glugged it straight down. Disgusting. It made me feel sick. But by the time I got back to college the self-conscious thing had gone. So I did it the next day. And the next. Everybody seemed to know what I was doing, except the teachers. It&apos;s the intensity of those teenage years that astonishes me: every emotion painted in shocking primary colours. If it was bad, it was the worst. If it was good, it was the best. No in-betweens. How did I get over the drinking? I was lucky, I managed to drink myself out of it. Eventually I progressed to half a bottle of gin, and glugged that down in one five-minute sitting. Then I puked and puked and puked. Even now I can make myself sick smelling gin. Then there was love. It was Ned who first pointed out Alison. She had a black bob, a long intellectual nose and sometimes wore a bowler hat. The first time I saw her outside college was a fluke. It was in the cafe of the Royal Exchange in Manchester city centre, on a wintry Friday afternoon. I sat and talked to her. I loved being close to her. She wore a huge white woolly jumper, her cheeks were flushed and she seemed warm for such a cold day. We walked together for a bit and separated. The next Friday I turned up at the Exchange, just in case. Again she was there, drinking coffee. I pretended it was another fluke, but she must have known. And so it went on, week upon week, and we became closer, and I failed to act on it, as I always did. She invited me back to her house one lunchtime. It was only five minutes&apos; walk from college. She seemed older than her years, despite the fact that she skip-walked and carried a satchel. We sat in her sun-lounge, and listened to Desire by Bob Dylan. We knew pretty much everything about each other. Her best friend was Dom, who was always around the house. He was elegant, beautiful, chaste, but obviously gay. He was around 18 when he started having relationships. The next thing he was dead, the first person we knew to die of Aids. We spent every lunch and more at her house. If we did OK at our A- levels, we&apos;d go on to university \u2013 her to Liverpool, me to Leeds. But that wasn&apos;t an ambition as such, it was another means of deferral. Margaret Thatcher had come to power, the economy was broken and unemployment was becoming the norm for college leavers. Some of my optimism and confidence was restored. If only there hadn&apos;t been Cardboard Dave. Cardboard Dave was Alison&apos;s father \u2013 an old-school racist who had owned a cardboard factory back in South Africa before marrying Alison&apos;s mum. Cardboard Dave was extremely intelligent, a bully who only had time for his smelly dog Chops, and he was unstable. He used to disguise himself in the plastic nose/moustache/glasses combination available at all good newsagents, and spy on us when we were in bed. Once he jumped out of her wardrobe, fully disguised, proclaiming, Sherlock Holmes like, &quot;So you are sleeping with my daughter!&quot; He could be funny, but never intentionally. More often he was unpleasant, and occasionally terrifying. One night he was in a foul mood. He ordered me to leave the house. I refused. He pulled the wires out of the phone. Alison had told me that he did that when he was going to beat them. I was in her room. He was in the living room with Alison&apos;s mum. We could hear his blows and her screams. I just stood there listening, doing nothing. Alison said it would be best to leave. I felt ashamed. I barely registered my last six months at college. I became phobic about it. Some days I&apos;d borrow Mum&apos;s car, drive into college, then pack six or seven of us in the Mini for a trip to the pub. It wasn&apos;t being deliberately reckless, just the old passivity \u2013 it seemed easier risking our lives than saying no to my friends. Perhaps what made my teen years so painful and exhilarating was that mix of being loud and extrovert and cripplingly shy. My best friend David was the same. I remember the parties we had when our parents were away. We invited everybody, and it was only in the build-up that we began to think through the reality \u2013 at heart, we were antisocial gits who just wanted to be left alone. So we got out a bottle of gin and drank our way through them. On one occasion, when I answered the door to our first guest Craig, I couldn&apos;t work out why he was laughing at me \u2013 until he said: &quot;All right, Si, why&apos;ve you got no clothes on?&quot; (I still don&apos;t know why.) Not surprisingly, I made a mess of my A-levels. My teachers refused to support me in having my grades challenged as they thought I deserved everything I had got. Alison also made a mess of her exams. We crept into different universities, with severe tickings off and orders to improve our attitude. Soon after that we split up. I was almost 19 by the time I arrived at Leeds University and had a good year left of teenage abandon. But by then I was knackered. Teendom had knocked the stuffing out of me. I&apos;d had enough of neuroses and scrapes, abusers and voyeurs, love and loss. I just wanted to settle down into sensible middle age.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-16T07:00:13Z", "title": "Growing pains: my journey into adulthood", "sentences": ["A late-night walk along a Tel Aviv beach ended with me losing my virginity."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/16/simon-hattenstone-teenage-years"}, {"tags": ["Liverpool", "Celtic", "Europa League", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport", "Sporting Braga", "Champions League 2010-11"], "article": "Celtic will play the Portuguese side Braga in the third qualifying round of the Champions League.

But here every stone and blade of grass comes with a bitter and contested history. This unremarkable plot on Jaffa&apos;s Etrog Road is at the centre of a struggle that touches on social, religious, nationalist, economic and legal questions and which \u2013 whatever the outcome \u2013 will inevitably result in further strife. Jaffa is one of the few areas of Israel where Muslims and Jews have coexisted, albeit often uneasily, for decades. But the determination of an organisation of national-religious Jews to build a 20-apartment development, exclusively for subscribers to a rigidly Zionist ideology, is threatening to destabilise the delicate balance in this troubled area of Israel&apos;s main city, Tel Aviv. This week the high court in Jerusalem is set to rule on a case brought by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel claiming that the project discriminates against Arabs and non-religious Jews. The organisation behind the development, Bemuna, says it merely wants to create a religious community free from non-Jewish and secular influences. The activists fear the newcomers intend to impose their observances on the neighbourhood \u2013 such as a prohibition on driving cars on the Jewish sabbath. They blame the state of Israel for leasing the land to Bemuna in the full knowledge that it planned to build housing barred to locals. &quot;If they come, the community will be polarised,&quot; local historian and political activist Sami Abu Shehadeh told the Observer. &quot;Those people that say Jaffa is a model of coexistence will be silenced.&quot; Their objective, he claims, is to &quot;Judaise&quot; a mainly Arab neighbourhood. Bemuna rejects this, saying it aims to &quot;spread Torah&quot; (religious texts) among secular Jews. &quot;Jewish families buy properties in [Jaffa] all the time, but when a religious company decides to do so it is unfortunately considered to be racism,&quot; Israel Zeira, the company&apos;s chief executive, told the Observer. He earlier told the Jerusalem Post that claims of Judaisation were &quot;a ridiculous incitement by radical Muslim elements who make their money from strife and conflict&quot;. Jaffa \u2013 the &quot;Bride of Palestine&quot; \u2013 was the country&apos;s commercial and cultural centre in the first half of the last century. All that changed in 1948 when, according to an &quot;abridged history&quot; displayed by the Tel Aviv city authority on a boulevard overlooking the Mediterranean, &quot;Jaffa was liberated&quot; in the war that led to the creation of the state of Israel. The Arab population saw it rather differently. The vast majority of the 100,000 Arabs in Jaffa were forced to leave in fear for their lives; the port and beaches were packed with families scrambling for places on ships to Gaza or Lebanon. Others fled on foot to Nablus in the West Bank or Jordan. Within days, only 4,000 remained; the rest were destined to be lifelong refugees. &quot;All the Palestinians in Jaffa were rounded up and brought to the Ajami neighbourhood, surrounded by a fence with soldiers and dogs,&quot; said Abu Shehadeh. &quot;The Jews called our neighbourhood a ghetto. My grandfather, who used to get a taxi from Jaffa to Beirut, needed military permission to leave\u00a0Ajami.&quot; A year later Israel decreed that properties whose owners were &quot;absent&quot; would pass to the state. Not only did all of Jaffa&apos;s refugees lose their property, but so did those forced into Ajami who owned property in other areas of the city: &quot;1948 was the first naqba [catastrophe],&quot; said Abu Shehadeh. &quot;The absentee law was the second.&quot; An Israeli policy of moving new, poor Jewish immigrants into Ajami during the 1950s worsened the overcrowding. Ajami became the most deprived and criminal neighbourhood of Tel Aviv. After decades of neglect, developers spotted Jaffa&apos;s potential. Work began on renovating the Old City in the 1960s; today it is a charming area of bijou shops, galleries, museums and restaurants. Even this has not been without controversy. Not one of the artists in the &quot;artists&apos; quarter&quot; is Arab, says Abu Shehadeh. Developers have moved beyond the Old City. There is a plan for the former Ottoman-era prison in the grounds of Jaffa&apos;s main mosque to be converted into a boutique hotel. A shopping mall has been proposed. Gated apartment blocks are being built for Jews from abroad. &quot;The whole neighbourhood is a construction site,&quot; said Abu Shehadeh. &quot;We \u2013 the Arabs \u2013 are being forced out again, but we have nowhere else to go. Usually in gentrification projects at least part of the community enjoys the benefits. Not\u00a0here.&quot; Arabs who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948 were subsequently only allowed to part-own property in Jaffa, he said. For three decades, no permits were granted by the city authority for Arabs to extend homes. Many did so illegally, as their families expanded. Now, locals say, 500 families have been issued with eviction or destruction orders and more are facing huge fines. Abu Shehadeh estimated that 5-10% of local Arabs had benefited from tourism and gentrification schemes. This comes on top of overcrowding, poor education, inadequate policing, crime and poverty \u2013 all graphically depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Ajami. These issues are not being addressed, activists say. The authorities, they claim, are only interested in advancing the interests of Jewish incomers. Abu Shehadeh does not expect Ajami&apos;s Arabs to win their case on Wednesday. &quot;We have no power. Economically and politically we&apos;re at the margins,&quot; he said. Recounting a recent episode when, he claimed, national-religious Jews marched through Ajami, carrying Israeli flags and abusing Arabs, he said: &quot;After the court case, it will only be a question of time. They will come, and this will be our daily life.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-07-17T23:05:51Z", "title": "Jaffa's Arab haven of coexistence resists influx of Israeli hardliners", "sentences": ["But the determination of an organisation of national-religious Jews to build a 20-apartment development, exclusively for subscribers to a rigidly Zionist ideology, is threatening to destabilise the delicate balance in this troubled area of Israel&apos;s main city, Tel Aviv.", "All that changed in 1948 when, according to an &quot;abridged history&quot; displayed by the Tel Aviv city authority on a boulevard overlooking the Mediterranean, &quot;Jaffa was liberated&quot; in the war that led to the creation of the state of Israel.", "Ajami became the most deprived and criminal neighbourhood of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/jaffa-arab-tel-aviv-settlers"}, {"tags": ["Franz Kafka", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Switzerland", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Franz Kafka wanted all his manuscripts to be burned after his death, but his friend Max Brod disregarded the request, seeding a complex legal battle over thousands of manuscripts that has the literary world agog. That legal tussle takes a new twist today as four safety deposit boxes in a Zurich bank containing the manuscripts are opened. The boxes are believed to contain thousands of manuscripts by Kafka and Brod, including letters, journals, sketches and drawings, some of which have never been published and could provide literary detetectives an insight into one of the 20th century&apos;s greatest writers. The move in Zurich follows similar action at two Tel Aviv banks, which were ordered by an Israeli tribunal to extract Kafka&apos;s works from their vaults. The documents form the heart of a dispute over ownership between the state of Israel and the Hoffe sisters who say they inherited Kafka&apos;s estate from their mother Esther Hoffe \u2013 Brod&apos;s secretary. Brod not only ignored Kafka&apos;s wishes but published his work and bequeathed the originals to Esther Hoffe. Israel, however, claims that Kafka&apos;s documents are the property of the state as Brod migrated to Israel in 1939. Esther&apos;s daughter, Eve Hoffe of Tel Aviv, is expected to be present at the opening of the boxes, along with a delegation of lawyers appointed by the court. Assisted by German literary experts and a manuscript expert, they will convey to the court a precise record of what the boxes contain. The attorneys will be assisted by German literary experts and a manuscript expert. The judge will then decide whether to return the documents to the safety deposit boxes or transfer them to a public archive, to be published for the benefit of future generations. Meanwhile, the Israeli court is expected to rule on Hoffe&apos;s petition calling for a gag order on the contents of the box. The Israeli paper, Haaretz, has asked the court to allow the documents to be published, citing their public and literary value. Kafka died from tuberculosis in 1924, leaving a set of instructions to Brod: &quot;Dearest Max, My last request: Everything I leave behind me [is] to be burned unread.&quot; But Brod instead published for the first time Kafka&apos;s novels The Trial, The Castle and Amerika. In 1939 Brod fled his home in Prague as the Nazis approached and took a single suitcase of Kafka papers to Tel Aviv, where he started a new life. He later donated manuscripts of The Castle and Amerika to Oxford University, but kept the original of The Trial for himself. After the death of his wife, Brod began a relationship with his assistant, Esther Hoffe. When he died in 1968, he left a will that is now disputed. She sold documents over several years and when she died in 2007 ago she left the remaining papers to her daughters Eva and Ruti.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-19T10:53:39Z", "title": "Lawyers open cache of unpublished Kafka manuscripts", "sentences": ["The move in Zurich follows similar action at two Tel Aviv banks, which were ordered by an Israeli tribunal to extract Kafka&apos;s works from their vaults.", "Esther&apos;s daughter, Eve Hoffe of Tel Aviv, is expected to be present at the opening of the boxes, along with a delegation of lawyers appointed by the court.", "In 1939 Brod fled his home in Prague as the Nazis approached and took a single suitcase of Kafka papers to Tel Aviv, where he started a new life."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/19/lawyers-open-unpublished-kafka-manuscripts"}, {"tags": ["Franz Kafka", "Czech Republic", "Israel", "Germany", "Switzerland", "Books", "Heritage", "Culture", "World news", "Law", "Europe"], "article": "If it were any other writer, today\u2019s unfolding of events in an anonymous bank vault in Zurich would be described as Kafkaesque. But the latest twist in a legal battle over the estate of Franz Kafka probably deserves some other adjective. Four desposit boxes were prised open. Inside were manuscripts, drawings and letters from the Czech writer that had been locked away for more than 50 years, as Kafka experts around the world waited with bated breath. But the expectant Kafka enthusiasts, historians and critics will have to wait longer, after two Israeli sisters who insist they own the papers by inheritance from their mother banned all reporting of the boxes\u2019 contents. They were opened on the orders of Talia Koppelman, a judge from the Tel Aviv family court. Last week she also ordered the opening of six safety deposit boxes in Israeli banks containing other Kafka works. Today\u2019s unlocking at Zurich\u2019s UBS bank of safes sealed since 1956 was attended by lawyers representing, on one side, Eve and Ruth Hoffe and the German literature archive, and, on the other, the state of Israel and its national library. A literature professor who is an authority on Kafka, Itta Shedletzky, was also present and will compile an inventory of the contents of the boxes. If the Jewish novelist, who wrote in German while living in Prague, had had his way, the boxes would not exist. Shortly before his death from tuberculosis in 1924, Kafka wrote to his friend Max Brod: \u201cDearest Max, my last request: everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters ... [is] to be burned unread.\u201d Brod refused to heed his dying friend\u2019s wish, saying it puzzled him. In 1939, on the eve of the Nazi invasion, he smuggled two suitcases of material to Palestine. During the Suez crisis in 1956, he moved parts of the archive to Switzerland. His action saved the manuscripts of The Castle, The Trial and Amerika. After Brod\u2019s death, the papers and manuscripts became the possession of Esther Hoffe, his former secretary and later romantic companion who lived in Tel Aviv until her death three years ago. Hoffe refused repeated requests to hand the papers over to the state of Israel; once she was even arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle some out of the country. Following her death, Hoffe\u2019s daughters, Eva Hoffe and Ruti Wisler, have stubbornly insisted on their right to the documents. They have already sold some of them, including the handwritten manuscript of The Trial, to the German literature archive. Although today\u2019s opening took place in secret, those who have followed the row talk of \u201cliterary gems\u201d\u2019 to be uncovered. It is known, for instance, that some pages from Letter to my Father, a hurt and angry text which he wrote in 1919 and which is seen as the key to understanding the author\u2019s mind, are among the contents. Other manuscripts in Kafka\u2019s hand include A Country Doctor, Wedding Preparations in the Country, and A Dream. They are estimated to be worth several hundred thousand pounds. A tantalising glimpse of what might be in the boxes came when documents once in Esther Hoffe\u2019s possession were auctioned in Basle in 2009. One was a letter to Brod, in which Kafka stated: \u201cI know allusions of the terror of loneliness. Not so much the loneliness of being alone, as that among people.\u201d Klaus Wagenbach, a German publisher who was close to Brod, described the letter in its entirety as \u201cone of Kafka\u2019s most beautiful ever\u201d. Meir Heller, lawyer for Israel\u2019s national library, said the Zurich hoard amounted to a national cultural treasure. \u201cThe documents have to be made accessible to the public in Israel,\u201d he said. He asserted that a passage in Brod\u2019s will states that they should go to an institution in Israel on his death. The Hoffes, he claimed, had been keen to \u201cconceal the truth behind ... the details of Brod\u2019s true will\u201d. The Hoffe family has had access blocked to all parts of their mother\u2019s estate, including her money and jewellery, while the dispute continues. The family says the state is intruding on its right to sell its private possessions, further arguing that Israel and the Israelis never had an affinity with Kafka, who did not live in Israel, though he expressed a desire to do so, and that Israel has not even named a street in his memory. Their lawyer, Oded Hacohen, said opening the boxes would \u201cdamage my clients\u2019 privacy\u201d, and also restrict their ability to sell the items in the future. A decision by Koppelman as to whether the documents should be made public is imminent. Life and works Franz Kafka was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Prague in 1883. His most famous novel, The Trial, below, first published in 1925 in Berlin, later became a symbol of 20th century totalitarianism, seen to have predicted the horrors to come in the 20th century. \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019 is a word now used to describe everything from entrapment in bureaucracy to the general absurdity of life. Other works include The Metamophosis (1915), The Castle (1926), and Amerika (1917), below. Some were only published after his death. His troubled relationship with his overbearing father greatly influenced his writings. Kafka\u2019s often unfulfilled love life is also the subject of much speculation, and his love letters to three women in particular have been much studied. The themes of alienation, persecution and hopelessness run through his work, which attracted little attention until after his death from tuberculosis in 1924 at the age of41. While not much connected to Jewish religious life, he was fascinated by Jewish culture, particularly Yiddish. He is buried in Prague, and the house where he was born, just off the city\u2019s old town square, is home to an exhibition. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2010.

In fluent Hebrew, she sums up the inhumanity of Israel&apos;s plans to deport the children of foreign workers. &quot;It&apos;s like they&apos;re taking sheep and packing them,&quot; she says. While Michelle will probably be naturalised, Israel is set to expel scores of minors, along with their families, to their parents&apos; country of origin. The criteria that determine who will get residency are rigid and arbitrary. Because of tight age restrictions and an even smaller window to get one&apos;s paperwork turned in (parents will have just three weeks to submit documents that might be impossible to obtain) many children will be left out in the cold. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to rally against the deportations. The scene was heart rending. Little girls sat on a ledge, swinging their feet, holding a poster that read: &quot;Don&apos;t deport us.&quot; A young boy gripped a sign with the message: &quot;We are all Israeli children.&quot; Noa Kaufman, an activist with Israeli Children, a grassroots movement founded specifically to advocate for the kids facing deportation, said that all must be allowed to stay. She remarked that the expulsion would not only damage the families of migrant workers, it would be harmful to Israel, as well, making the country &quot;so white and so ugly&quot;. It&apos;s a thinly veiled accusation of ethnic cleansing \u2013 something activists have shied away from during the year-long battle over the issue. The struggle began last summer when Israel first announced its plans to deport 1,200 Israeli-born children \u2013 a number that will probably be reduced by the recommendations of a governmental committee. The move, part of a broader crackdown on Israel&apos;s approximately 250,000 undocumented migrant labourers, will be a reversal of the state&apos;s long-held policy against deporting minors. The public was outraged. Massive protests delayed the expulsion until the end of the school year. While the children were born to non-Jewish parents, they are unequivocally Israeli. They go to local schools, speak fluent Hebrew and celebrate both national and religious holidays. Their homes often include Shabbat candles, hanukiyot, and kippot, as parents accommodate their assimilated children. Immersed in the culture, the kids profess a love for Israel, a country they embrace as their own. But Israel, a state of immigrants that has no immigration law besides the Jewish right of return, would prefer to expel them. Israel began bringing foreign workers into the country in the late 1980s, during the first intifada, to replace Palestinian day labourers. Now the state says it wants to reduce its dependency on migrant labourers. But in 2009 \u2013 the same year that the government announced its intention to deport the children \u2013 the state issued a record number of visas for more to come. Perhaps interior minister Eli Yishai was being more honest about the government&apos;s motives when, speaking to the Israeli daily Haaretz, he called the 1,200 children a &quot;demographic threat \u2026 liable to damage the state&apos;s Jewish identity&quot;. And Yishai showed his true colours when he remarked that migrant workers bring &quot;a profusion of diseases&quot; to Israel. State policies are similarly racist, revealing a blatant disregard for foreign workers&apos; humanity. Migrant labourers who fall in love and marry can be stripped of their legal status. Women who bear children must choose between keeping their baby or their visa. If a mother won&apos;t ship her newborn child home, she and her child become &quot;illegal&quot; and, now, subject to deportation. The policies might be shocking but they aren&apos;t surprising. What can be expected of a state that builds settlements at the expense of peace? What can be expected of a government that subjects 1.5m Gazans to collective punishment? The connection between the plight of the children and the Palestinian struggle was apparent on Saturday night. Some of the Israeli demonstrators were wearing T-shirts reading: &quot;Free Sheikh Jarrah&quot;. Chants common to protests against the separation barrier were used, substituting girosh (deportation) for kibush (occupation). The scene was a reminder that a state &quot;so white and so ugly&quot; was established long ago \u2013 the children are just the latest victims. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-07-20T09:02:10Z", "title": "Children are just Israel's latest victims | Mya Guarnieri", "sentences": ["Hundreds of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to rally against the deportations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/jul/20/children-israels-latest-victims-deport"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "UK news", "World news", "Politics", "William Hague", "Dominic Grieve"], "article": "The family of British activist Tom Hurndall have demanded a meeting with the British government after the Israeli authorities announced the early release of the soldier who killed him. Taysir Hayb will be freed next month after serving six years of his eight-year sentence, after a ruling on Monday by the Kastina military court in southern Israel. Hurndall was shot in the head in April 2003 as he was helping Palestinian children to cross a street in Rafah, Gaza. Hurndall&apos;s father said yesterday he was not surprised by the early release of Hayb, who he said had been treated as a scapegoat by the Israeli army. He is asking for a meeting with the foreign secretary, William Hague, and the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, to put greater pressure on Israel over civilian deaths. &quot;Taysir was part of a policy and was not the principal culprit,&quot; Anthony Hurndall said. &quot;The issue is that the Israeli army are uncaring of civilian safety.&quot; Hayb was convicted of Hurndall&apos;s manslaughter in 2005 after claiming he was shooting at an armed Palestinian. He later admitted that was a lie. A month before Hurndall&apos;s death, American activist Rachel Corrie was killed by an Israeli army bulldozer in Gaza. James Miller, 34, a British cameraman, was shot dead in Gaza in May the same year. Hurndall, a 21-year-old activist, had been filming with the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement when he was shot. He died in London after nine months in a coma. In a statement the Foreign Office said: &quot;We note the court&apos;s decision to release Taysir Hayb and recognise the grief this decision will cause to the Hurndall family. We have the deepest of sympathies for the Hurndall family. Tom&apos;s death was a tragedy.&quot; Anthony Hurndall described the statement as tame. He said: &quot;I would like them to say that this is not just a tragedy but that the Israeli government is directly responsibility for Tom&apos;s death and should acknowledge this and take steps to put matters right by changing policies to ensure that civilians are not shot or killed indiscriminately. I&apos;m disappointed; they could have said it more forcefully.&quot; He added: &quot;We would now like a meeting with William Hague and the attorney general. That rather weak response should act as a trigger to a meeting. We want the British government to help ensure that senior officers are bought to account and prosecuted.&quot; Mr Hurndall, a former property lawyer who took up his son&apos;s case, added: &quot;There are so many accounts of civilians being killed deliberately for no immediate military benefit. It&apos;s gone on for 10 years and it is deeply callous. We came to this situation with open minds but the more we have investigated the clearer it has become that this is an inhumane and brutal policy.&quot; Speaking for the Hurndall family, he said: &quot;We are not anti-Israeli or pro-Palestinian. Our deep concern here is that nothing is going to happen to resolve issues between the Israel and the Palestinians unless there is a degree of honesty and fact-facing and balance restored. &quot;War crimes have been committed and continue to be committed in Gaza.&quot;Hurndall&apos;s sister Sophie told Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper that she was &quot;angry and shocked&quot; by the early release of Hayb. But she said she blamed the Israeli military rather than Hayb. &quot;It&apos;s about the system. Not the man himself,&quot; she told Haaretz. &quot;This man who shot Tom was the same age as him. He is both the victim and the killer. He is part of a system that proactively encouraged soldiers to target civilians.&quot; Hayb&apos;s lawyer welcomed the decision. &quot;At first, we found it hard to believe that the committee will have the possibility and the courage to face great international pressures not to release him. Eventually, we are happy that the committee made the right decision, giving priority to Taysir&apos;s rehabilitation and return to civil society.&quot; After the hearing Hayb said: &quot;I feel regret and I am sorry for what has happened ... We cannot bring the person back, but we must not bury the person that committed the crime. Okay, there was a mistake, I understand what happened, but I also did time in prison ... The case and the deceased will stay with me for the rest of my life.&quot;Hayb was also convicted of obstruction of justice, giving false testimony and soliciting false testimony. Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;We lobbied the Israeli government extensively on this issue following Tom Hurndall&apos;s death. Since the news of Taysir Hayb&apos;s release emerged, we have been trying to establish the reasons why he has been released early. We have today raised it with the Israelis through both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tel Aviv and the Israeli Embassy in London. We will press them for an immediate response on this issue. &quot;We will be in touch further with the family when we are able to give them a clearer picture. We can understand the distress that this news has caused and we are keen to provide a timely and accurate response based on a full understanding of the facts. &quot;As a general matter of policy, the UK is unequivocal about the need for Israel and the IDF to act with restraint and in line with international law, particularly in its conduct in the Occupied Territories.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-07-20T12:40:00Z", "title": "Family of Briton killed by Israeli soldier demand meeting with ministers", "sentences": ["We have today raised it with the Israelis through both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tel Aviv and the Israeli Embassy in London."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/20/israeli-soldier-tom-hurndall-released"}, {"tags": ["Sex Pistols", "Music", "Marketing & PR", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "John Lydon"], "article": "Johnny Rotten has cheated on me.

Call me naive for clinging to teenage illusions but I never thought I would learn that Lydon has gone from bellowing &quot;I am the antichrist&quot; at the establishment to &quot;I sell&quot; at an unappreciative marketing industry. It might be daft to ascribe an ethos to a shambolic musical genre like punk rock, yet it seemed to represent values at odds with those espoused by the two political figures who defined the decade after Anarchy in the UK: Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The punk lexicon had no shortage of slogans but &quot;greed is good&quot; wasn&apos;t one of them. There were plenty of others politicised by punk. Billy Bragg has told of how he set up the Jail Guitar Doors initiative \u2013 which provides musical instruments to prisoners \u2013 after hooking up with admirers of Joe Strummer following the fifth anniversary of his death in 2002. &quot;Although we may have hung up our leather jackets, those of us who were touched by the fire of punk have held onto our antifascist ideals,&quot; Bragg said. &quot;We were amazed to find that many of us were involved in activism in one way or another \u2013 union organisers, environmental campaigners, documentary filmmakers.&quot; Whereas Strummer was more obviously leftwing than Lydon, both have proven inspirational to numerous musicians who reject the silly notion that pop and politics shouldn&apos;t mix. The often fabulous Asian Dub Foundation are among those known to have blared PiL&apos;s Metal Box album on their tour-bus speakers. A few months ago Lydon claimed he&apos;s &quot;well-known for being a pacifist&quot; and named Mahatma Gandhi as his all-time hero. Surely, then, he would be open to supporting one of the most impressive examples of Gandhi&apos;s principles being put into action in today&apos;s world: the weekly demonstrations in the West Bank village of Bi&apos;lin, where unarmed activists are regularly fired at by Israeli forces. Surely, too, he would be sympathetic to the call made by numerous Palestinian trade unions and other campaign groups for a cultural and economic boycott of Israel. Not a chance, I&apos;m afraid. Lydon has vowed to go ahead with a PiL concert in Tel Aviv, scheduled for late August. &quot;If Elvis-fucking-Costello wants to pull out of a gig in Israel because he&apos;s suddenly got this compassion for Palestinians, then good on him,&quot; Lydon told the Independent. &quot;But I have absolutely one rule, right? Until I see an Arab country, a Muslim country, with a democracy, I won&apos;t understand how anyone can have a problem with how they&apos;re treated.&quot; How can Lydon so callously disregard the suffering of a people under colonial occupation? The answer is easy. PiL will be performing in Tel Aviv as headliners at a festival sponsored by Heineken.

Two elderly sisters living in Israel who inherited the papers in 2008 from their mother, Esther Hoffe, the secretary of Kafka&apos;s close friend Max Brod, had tried to prevent details of the material being made public on the grounds that it would compromise their &quot;property, assets, rights, privacy and human dignity&quot;. Even if the boxes contained nothing new, Kafka scholars would almost certainly have made good use of papers in Kafka&apos;s own handwriting to enrich understanding of the literary giant&apos;s work. But the first box opened yesterday appears to contain a handwritten story by Kafka that has never been seen before, making the granting of public access even more significant than scholars must have expected. If the undignified squabbling over these papers, which has gone on since Hoffe died two years ago, is about to come to an end, and the path to eventual publication of all relevant material has been opened, progress of sorts will have been made. Perhaps we will now hear no more of the absurd arguments made last year by the 75-year-old Eva Hoffe that Israel is incapable of looking after the manuscripts. &quot;We have other things to do. We have terror and the fight for survival,&quot; she said. Hoffe wants to sell the papers, or some of them at least, to the German literary archive in the city of Marbach. &quot;Sorry, but culture is not first on the list,&quot; claimed Eva. &quot;In Israel there is no place to keep the papers so well as in Germany.&quot; Marbach would no doubt do the papers proud, but to suggest that a country that has played a very significant role in the preservation of pre-Holocaust eastern and central European Jewish heritage couldn&apos;t manage Kafka&apos;s papers successfully sounds like a self-serving argument driven by Hoffe&apos;s desire to maximise her earnings. But the decision of the court is only progress of sorts, because it leaves hanging in the air a much bigger question than who has the right to determine whether these papers can be made public. (The claim made by the Hoffe sisters that they can legally sell them \u2013 indeed, they already sold some papers to Marbach at auction for \u00a31.1m \u2013 was not considered by the court, but will certainly be challenged.) The Israel National Library has taken a leading role in the affair and appealed against the attempt to prevent publication (the Israeli daily Haaretz did, too, separately). And at the heart of its campaign, the library uses the argument that Kafka&apos;s papers are &quot;cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people&quot;; a national treasure that belongs to the state because Brod took them with him when he emigrated to Palestine in 1939. The ownership of heirless pre-Holocaust European Jewish cultural assets \u2013 not to mention whether Kafka&apos;s papers can first and foremost be placed in such a category \u2013 is a hugely controversial issue. In recent years, following the collapse of the Communist regimes in Europe, Israel has increasingly laid claim to be the heir of various kinds of so-called heirless communal and private property, using the precedent of the 1952 reparations agreement with the German Federal Republic, which paid billions of deutschmarks in restitution and compensation for what Nazi Germany did to European Jews during the second world war. Many European Jewish communities, however, have strongly objected to this policy, which is grounded in the notion that since such a large proportion of European Jewry was murdered in the Holocaust and so many survivors emigrated to Palestine, the &quot;remnants&quot; left in communities today cannot possibly be regarded as the rightful heirs of either the movable or the built Jewish heritage. Today&apos;s Jewish communities do not say that every Jewish cultural artefact belongs to them, but they fundamentally reject the notion that they are not autonomous entities capable of discharging the responsibility for maintaining and developing European Jewry&apos;s cultural heritage. And there is no doubt that the movement to preserve Jewish heritage and culture in Europe, and make them part of living and breathing communities, has grown substantially in recent years and is immensely important both for Jews themselves and for their place in European society. A particularly egregious example of how some Israeli institutions, encouraged by the government, have ridden roughshod over European Jewish communities was the clandestine removal by the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem of the Holocaust murals painted by the Jewish artist and writer Bruno Schulz in 2001, from a house in the former Polish village of Drohobycz. An international furore broke out once the actions of Yad Vashem became public. Jewish heritage experts regarded the act as a form of piracy. The pieces went on display in the museum last year. What&apos;s not at issue is the crucial role played by such Israeli institutions as the Central Archives of the History of the Jewish People in Jerusalem and the Centre for Jewish Art at the Hebrew University in preserving and documenting the legacy of pre-Holocaust European Jewish life. But if the national library claims the legacy of Kafka for the Jewish state, it, and institutions like it in Israel, can lay claim to practically any pre-Holocaust synagogue, artwork, manuscript or valuable ritual object extant in Europe. But neither Israel as a state, nor any state or public institution, has such a right. (And while it&apos;s true that Kafka is a key figure of the Jewish cultural past, as one of the world&apos;s most significant authors whose themes find echoes in many countries and cultures, Israel&apos;s proprietary attitude is surely misplaced.) The implied subservience of European Jewish communities to Israel is out of kilter with forward thinking about what is still described by the outmoded phrase &quot;Israel-Diaspora relations&quot;. If it&apos;s ultimately agreed that the Kafka material remains and is made publicly available in Israel for good practical and legal reasons, then all well and good. However, the mistaken notion that all the cultural assets of the Jewish people belong to Israel must play no part in such a decision. \u2022 This article was amended at 17:00 on 22 July 2010.

But the field of amateur dramatics definitely comes a close second. Enter Combatants for Peace, a group of Israelis and Palestinians who have been trained to fight either in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) or as Palestine&apos;s Fatah paramilitaries, but have now put down their guns and together taken to the stage. The group, formed in 2005, perform sketches based on their own experiences of war to promote a &quot;non-violent&quot; resolution to the conflict. Where these theatrical workshops take place is critical to the protest. Most recently, they improvised a scene about Israeli check-points to an audience of Palestinians, Israelis and international activists on a hill-top in the West Bank over-looking an Israeli settlement. They didn&apos;t get far before IDF officers stopped the show. Pitching a group of trained killers-turned-thespians as messengers of peace seems a hard sell: disputes over the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory resolved in one almighty improvisation workshop \u2026? Really? Even allowing for the most obliging of circumstances, it&apos;s difficult to see how theatre can pack so much as a glancing punch at figures of real power in Israel, Palestine or anywhere. No matter how powerfully a piece of anti-war drama is scripted or performed, or how important the audience, it takes a leap of faith to see how theatre can genuinely affect the direction of a conflict, particularly when it is pitted against the immovable brawn of the Israeli war machine or a Palestinian committed to martyrdom. But then there&apos;s none so zealous as a convert. Chen Alon, the group&apos;s founder, was a major in the IDF. Nour Shehadah, the group&apos;s Palestinian head, was a leading Fatah paramilitary. Shot in an assassination attempt by IDF soldiers in the early 90s, he spent five years in an Israeli jail and still lives with his family in Tulkarem, one of the largest refugee camps in the West Bank. Both are now passionately committed to working together towards a &quot;non-violent&quot; resolution to the conflict, citing Martin Luther King and Gandhi as inspirational figures. Group members have fought on opposing sides in the same gun battles; one former IDF officer even interrogated another Palestinian member. All the Israelis in the group served either as conflict soldiers or were stationed at volatile checkpoints, while most of the Palestinian members have spent time in Israeli prisons. Many have lost contact with their families, who now regard them as traitors. And yet the group is growing in number. The theatrical element is led by Alon, who has worked in the theatre since leaving the army (his military career ended with a six-month stint in Israeli jail for refusing to serve in Gaza in 2002). The group employ a method pioneered by Brazilian director Augusto Boal \u2013 &quot;the theatre of the oppressed&quot;. With an emphasis on audience participation, their performances aim to find resolutions to political dilemmas by acting them out as scenarios. There is widespread frustration among Israeli and Palestinian peace activists straining to make their voices heard. Home-grown dissenters are being dragged out for public humiliation and punishment by an increasingly right-wing Israeli government that has introduced laws branding activists as traitors who can be punished with prison sentences. Artists from the Pixies to the Klaxons have cancelled their Tel Aviv performances in protest at the deaths on board the ships attempting to break the blockade of Gaza, while in Israel itself beleaguered liberals are increasingly choosing not to speak out either from fear of the repercussions or straightforward hopelessness. But there is no chance of Combatants for Peace giving up. Speaking from the very pit of the conflict is a group with an absolute belief in the transformative power of empathy and the possibility of resolving conflict without violence. Shehadah says that, despite criticism from within his own community, he would prefer to leave Palestine than stop his work. It&apos;s hard not cheer a sentiment like this. Accepting the impotence of humanity (in this case, theatre) in the face of government-led conflict would be writing the region off as a lost cause, something too depressing to contemplate. Alon agrees: &quot;We don&apos;t have a Gandhi in the Middle East,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s no Israeli Martin Luther King. So while we wait for one to arrive, we have to do the best we can with what we have.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-07-22T16:46:27Z", "title": "Fighters turn to theatre to advocate Middle East peace | Phoebe Greenwood", "sentences": ["Artists from the Pixies to the Klaxons have cancelled their Tel Aviv performances in protest at the deaths on board the ships attempting to break the blockade of Gaza, while in Israel itself beleaguered liberals are increasingly choosing not to speak out either from fear of the repercussions or straightforward hopelessness."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/jul/22/fighters-theatre-middle-east-peace"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "World news", "Race issues"], "article": "Israel&apos;s liberal left has been warning about this for decades \u2013 and now those cautionary words seem like prophesies. Lines of Israeli authors, academics and campaigners have long said that the ugly occupation of the Palestinian people would corrode Israel and derail its democracy. Human rights advocates repeatedly warned that a nation capable of meting out such\u00a0punishing discrimination to another people would eventually turn on itself. And so it has. The country is in thrall to such anti-democratic sentiment and mob rule racism, manifesting at such breakneck speed that it is hard to keep up. In the last few months alone two Arab citizens of Israel were &quot;disappeared&quot; by the state&apos;s secret police; an Arab member of the Knesset was stripped of her parliamentary privileges for being on the Gaza aid flotilla; and now a Palestinian man from Jerusalem has just been convicted of rape after pretending to be Jewish and having consensual sex. This verdict, in effect turning the obfuscation of race into a criminal offence, also reveals the extent to which Israelis consider Palestinians to be abhorrent. Meanwhile, the Israeli children of migrant workers are threatened with expulsion, as a government campaign warns against hiring foreign workers. Zero tolerance for the &quot;other&quot; in Israel has widened to include anyone questioning a twisted concept of loyalty to the state. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (Acri) lists 14 antidemocratic laws currently working their way through parliament, from the demand that Arab citizens pledge allegiance to a &quot;Jewish democracy&quot; to attempts to gag Israeli rights groups. Acri representatives are denounced as &quot;Arab-lovers&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot; when they attend parliamentary hearings. All this has widespread support \u2013 in fact, one of the few causes to bring thousands of Israelis on to the streets was a recent ultra-orthodox protest for the right to segregate Ashkenazi children, of European origin, from their Middle Eastern Jewish classmates. Israeli human rights campaigners, appalled by this escalation of intolerance and racism, point to the three-week pounding of Gaza in 2008-9 as the opener of floodgates. Yael Ben Yefet, a Tel Aviv council member and the subject of a hate-deluge for supporting migrant workers, says that &quot;something snapped&quot; after the Gaza assault, in which about 1,400 Palestinians were killed. &quot;It released Israel from the last of its humanitarian constraints,&quot; she says. &quot;Now everything is possible.&quot; Israel may have new thresholds after its assault on Gaza and its subsequent election of a zealously hard-right government. But what we&apos;re seeing today is just the unleashing, in more blatant form, of a long-incubated racism, both institutional and incidental \u2013 a casual, acceptable prejudice. Such racism doesn&apos;t emanate, as some have argued, from the Jewish component of Israeli nationhood. It is informed by the Eurocentric cornerstones of the country: the belief, expressed by Israel&apos;s founding fathers and still current, that the nation should be a bastion of the &quot;enlightened&quot; west in the heart of the supposedly savage Middle East. As well as underpinning regional policy, such prejudice has long been directed at Israel&apos;s Jews of Middle Eastern origin, rubbishing their culture and turning them into a socioeconomically stunted group. Racism is the byproduct of the isolationism that is Israel&apos;s preferred form of regional interaction \u2013 it is the sniffy neighbour of the Middle East. The ban on travel to most Arab countries is of no consequence to the majority of Israelis, who could not be less interested in the region. That&apos;s also why practically nobody bothers to learn Arabic, one of Israel&apos;s official languages: there is no perceived benefit in communication with the people of the locale. This vacuum-sealed lack of curiosity is the perfect breeding ground for prejudice, because a minimal interest in variety is the precursor of tolerance and because cultures grow myopic without exposure to outside influence. Such a disdainful refusal to be part of the region is nonsensical, given that Israel&apos;s majority population is of Middle Eastern origin and that Judaism is so acculturated to the Arab world. But Israel has severed itself from a long-valued Judeo-Arab heritage, preferring to present a European image. Now, parading intolerance as a prized national feature has made Israel intolerable to anyone who fits the ever-widening definition of &quot;other&quot; \u2013 and the country is an increasingly insulting irritation to the region it has so arrogantly snubbed. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-07-23T08:00:40Z", "title": "Israel turns upon its own | Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["Yael Ben Yefet, a Tel Aviv council member and the subject of a hate-deluge for supporting migrant workers, says that &quot;something snapped&quot; after the Gaza assault, in which about 1,400 Palestinians were killed."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/23/israel-turns-upon-its-own"}, {"tags": ["David Cameron", "Foreign policy", "Conservatives", "Politics", "Turkey", "European Union", "World news", "Angela Merkel", "Germany", "France", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Europe"], "article": "David Cameron today challenges France and Germany over their opposition to Turkish membership of the EU when he issues a stark warning of the dangers of shutting Ankara &quot;out of the club&quot;. In a passionate defence of Turkey, whose EU ambitions have long been championed by Britain, the prime minister will accuse Paris and Berlin of double standards for expecting Ankara to guard Europe&apos;s borders as a Nato member while closing the door to EU membership. &quot;When I think about what Turkey has done to defend Europe as a Nato ally, and what Turkey is doing today in Afghanistan alongside our European allies, it makes me angry that your progress towards EU membership can be frustrated in the way it has been,&quot; the prime minister will say in a speech in the Turkish capital. &quot;I believe it&apos;s just wrong to say Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit inside the tent.&quot; The prime minister&apos;s speech comes at the start of a four-day visit to Turkey and India which he kicked off last night with dinner in Ankara with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister. Cameron will this morning lay a wreath at Anitkabir, the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern secular Turkey. In the afternoon he will fly to India for a three-day visit. Cameron&apos;s tough language in his speech today reflects Britain&apos;s frustration that Ankara&apos;s EU membership negotiations have stalled ever since they were formally opened in 2005. Turkey&apos;s involvement in the Cyprus dispute and its refusal to open its ports to Greek Cypriot goods are holding up the talks. In March Erdogan accused Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, of &quot;hatred&quot; towards Turkey. Merkel has called for Turkey to be given a &quot;privileged partnership&quot; with the EU. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, strongly opposes Turkish membership of the EU. Cameron today reserves special scorn for France as he will remind his audience that Britain knows what it is like to be blocked by Paris. He cites General Charles de Gaulle&apos;s famous &quot;non&quot; in 1963 and 1967 to British membership of the then-Common Market. The prime minister will say: &quot;Do you know who said: &apos;Here is a country which is not European. Its history, its geography, its economy, its agriculture and the character of its people \u2011 admirable people though they are \u2011 all point in a different direction. This is a country which cannot, despite what it claims and perhaps even believes, be a full member&apos;.&quot; Cameron will add: &quot;It might sound like some Europeans describing Turkey. But it was actually General de Gaulle describing the UK before vetoing our EU accession. We know what it&apos;s like to be shut out of the club. But we also know that these things can change.&quot; The de Gaulle quotes were echoed by a later French president who summed up the French hostility to Turkey. Val\u00e9ry Giscard d&apos;Estaing famously said of Turkey that it was too poor, too big and too different. The prime minister will confront this view when he criticises some Europeans who wrongly see the world &quot;through the prism of a clash of civilisations&quot;. He will add: &quot;Turkey can be a great unifier. Because instead of choosing between East and West, Turkey has chosen both. And it&apos;s this opportunity to unite East and West that gives Turkey such an important role with countries in the region in helping to deliver improved security for us all.&quot; Cameron&apos;s speech comes amid fears in Britain that French and German opposition to Turkey&apos;s EU membership is leading Ankara to abandon Europe and look to the east. Britain fears that the recent breach in relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv, after nine pro-Palestinians were killed by Israeli commandos in a raid on the Free Gaza flotilla in May, might have been easier to manage if Turkey felt it had a future in the west. The prime minister will say that Turkey must be made to feel welcome in Europe because it is a secular and democratic state. But he will reach out to Turkey&apos;s Muslim majority by saying how important Islam is to Europe.&quot;I will always argue that the values of real Islam are not incompatible with the values of Europe. That Europe is defined not by religion, but by values.&quot; But the prime minister will say that Turkey must press ahead with domestic reforms to allow its EU membership to proceed. Turkey has introduced tentative reforms to bring it into line with the liberal traditions of the EU. &quot;I&apos;m not asking you to be a different country, to abandon your values, your traditions or your culture,&quot; the prime minister will say. &quot;We want you to be Turkey \u2013 because it&apos;s as Turkey that you can play the unique role I have described in building greater security and greater prosperity for all our citizens. But we want you to push forwards aggressively with the EU reforms you&apos;re making.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-07-26T23:01:14Z", "title": "David Cameron warns EU not to shut Turkey out", "sentences": ["Britain fears that the recent breach in relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv, after nine pro-Palestinians were killed by Israeli commandos in a raid on the Free Gaza flotilla in May, might have been easier to manage if Turkey felt it had a future in the west."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/27/david-cameron-turkey-european-union"}, {"tags": ["David Cameron", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Turkey", "Israel", "Gaza", "Iran", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "Europe"], "article": "David Cameron used a visit to Turkey to make his strongest intervention yet in the intractable Middle East conflict today when he likened the experience of Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip to that of a &quot;prison camp&quot;. Although he has made similar remarks before, his decision to repeat them on a world stage in Turkey, whose relations with Israel have deteriorated sharply since it mounted a deadly assault on the Gaza flotilla, gave them much greater diplomatic significance. Cameron&apos;s comments, in a speech to business leaders in Ankara, prompted the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to issue another strong condemnation of how Israel dealt with the flotilla. Erdogan likened the behaviour of Israeli commandos, who shot dead nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists, to Somali pirates. Cameron&apos;s criticism of Tel Aviv came when he called for Israel to relax its restrictions on Gaza. &quot;The situation in Gaza has to change,&quot; he said. &quot;Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions. Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp.&quot; He strongly condemned Israel after the assault on the Gaza flotilla. &quot;The Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla was completely unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;I have told prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu we will expect the Israeli inquiry to be swift, transparent and rigorous. &quot;Let me also be clear that the situation in Gaza has to change.&quot; Cameron defended his remarks at a press conference with Erdogan. &quot;My description of Gaza is something I said in the House of Commons several weeks ago. Perhaps this is final proof that if you want to keep something completely secret you should announce it in the House of Commons.&quot; Hansard, the House of Commons&apos; official record, shows Cameron said on 28 June: &quot;Everybody knows that we are not going to sort out the problem of the Middle East peace process while there is, effectively, a giant open prison in Gaza.&quot; His choice of the words &quot;prison camp&quot; instead of &quot;open prison&quot; is likely to be seized upon. But a Downing Street source later tried to play down Cameron&apos;s comments. &quot;This is not an elevation of the rhetoric. This is equivalent language. The prime minister remains concerned.&quot; Cameron said Britain remained opposed to the blockade of Gaza. &quot;The fact is we have long supported lifting the blockade of Gaza, we have long supported proper humanitarian access. Even though some progress has been made we are still in the situation where it is very difficult to get in, it is very difficult to get out. So I think the description is warranted.&quot; At the press conference, Erdogan heaped further criticism on Israel over its treatment of the flotilla. &quot;What we saw happening was taking place in international waters and this attack in international waters, as such, can only be termed as piracy. There is no other way to describe it. &quot;The pirates are there in Somalia and we take our measures. When a similar situation occurs here ... political leaders, who are there to establish a fair life for everyone \u2013 they should not remain silent.&quot; After Cameron made his remarks, Ron Prosor, the Israeli ambassador to London, blamed the Palestinians&apos; situation on Hamas, the Islamist regime that controls the Gaza Strip. &quot;The people of Gaza are the prisoners of the terrorist organisation Hamas. The situation in Gaza is the direct result of Hamas&apos; rule and priorities. &quot;We know that the prime minister would also share our grave concerns about our own prisoner in the Gaza Strip, Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage there for over four years, without receiving a single Red Cross visit.&quot; Ephraim Sneh, the former Israeli deputy minister of defence, said: &quot;Cameron is right \u2013 Gaza is a prison camp, but those who control the prison are Hamas. I&apos;m totally against the double standards of a nation which fights the Taliban but is showing its solidarity with their brothers, Hamas. &quot;It&apos;s very regrettable that the British PM doesn&apos;t understand that. It reflects a lack of understanding and is a very bad sign. Cameron doesn&apos;t understand that 1.5m people live in Gaza under the repressive regime of Hamas \u2013 and yet he blames Israel.&quot; Also during his speech, Cameron challenged France and Germany over their opposition to Turkish membership of the EU. In a passionate defence of Turkey, the prime minister accused Paris and Berlin of double standards for expecting Ankara to guard Europe&apos;s borders as a Nato member while closing the door to EU membership. &quot;When I think about what Turkey has done to defend Europe as a Nato ally ... I believe it&apos;s just wrong to say Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit inside the tent.&quot; His tough language reflects Britain&apos;s frustration that Ankara&apos;s EU membership negotiations have stalled since they were formally opened in 2005. Turkey&apos;s involvement in the Cyprus dispute and its refusal to open its ports to Greek Cypriot goods are holding up the talks. Cameron also said Turkey should use its links with Iran to persuade Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Turkey is to abide by new UN sanctions, agreed last month, which are focused on individuals and companies linked to Iran&apos;s nuclear and missile programmes. But it will not implement wider US and EU restrictions on banks, and wants to deepen trade links with Iran. The prime minister said Turkey&apos;s special place, as a bridge between east and west, gave it a key role with Iran. &quot;It&apos;s Turkey that can help us stop Iran from getting the bomb,&quot; he said. Iran reached an agreement in May with Turkey and Brazil to export 1,200kg of low-enriched uranium in return for fuel rods for a civilian reactor. The prime minister said he hoped this understanding could help &quot;see Iran move in the right direction&quot;. But he cast doubt over Iran&apos;s intentions when he said: &quot;Even if Iran were to complete the deal proposed in their recent agreement with Turkey and Brazil, it would still retain around 50% of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium.&quot; The prime minister is on a four-day visit to Turkey and India. Cameron laid a wreath at Anitkabir, the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the father of modern secular Turkey, before delivering his address.

Once I entered the dirt road leading to the village I saw scores of vans with heavily armed policemen getting ready to leave. Their mission, it seems, had been accomplished. The signs of destruction were immediately evident. I first noticed the chickens and geese running loose near a bulldozed house, and then saw another house and then another one, all of them in rubble. A few children were trying to find a shaded spot to hide from the scorching desert sun, while behind them a stream of black smoke rose from the burning hay. The sheep, goats and the cattle were nowhere to be seen \u2013 perhaps because the police had confiscated them. Scores of Bedouin men were standing on a yellow hill, sharing their experiences from the early morning hours, while all around them uprooted olive trees lay on the ground. A whole village comprising between 40 and 45 houses had been completely razed in less than three hours. I suddenly experienced deja vu: an image of myself walking in the rubbles of a destroyed village somewhere on the outskirts of the Lebanese city of Sidon emerged. It was over 25 years ago, during my service in the Israeli paratroopers. But in Lebanon the residents had all fled long before my platoon came, and we simply walked in the debris. There was something surreal about the experience, which prevented me from fully understanding its significance for several years. At the time, it felt like I was walking on the moon. This time the impact of the destruction sank in immediately. Perhaps because the 300 people who resided in al-Arakib, including their children, were sitting in the rubble when I arrived, and their anguish was evident; or perhaps because the village is located only 10 minutes from my home in Be&apos;er Sheva and I drive past it every time I go to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem; or perhaps because the Bedouins are Israeli citizens, and I suddenly understood how far the state is ready to go to accomplish its objective of Judaising the Negev region; what I witnessed was, after all, an act of ethnic cleansing. They say the next intifada will be the Bedouin intifada. There are 155,000 Bedouins in the Negev, and more than half of them live in unrecognised villages without electricity or running water. I do not know what they might do, but by making 300 people homeless, 200 of them children, Israel is surely sowing dragon&apos;s teeth for the future. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-07-28T09:00:45Z", "title": "Ethnic cleansing in the Israeli Negev | Neve Gordon", "sentences": ["Perhaps because the 300 people who resided in al-Arakib, including their children, were sitting in the rubble when I arrived, and their anguish was evident; or perhaps because the village is located only 10 minutes from my home in Be&apos;er Sheva and I drive past it every time I go to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem; or perhaps because the Bedouins are Israeli citizens, and I suddenly understood how far the state is ready to go to accomplish its objective of Judaising the Negev region; what I witnessed was, after all, an act of ethnic cleansing."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/28/ethnic-cleansing-israeli-negev"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "United Nations", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news", "Gaza flotilla"], "article": "Israel today agreed to co-operate with a UN investigation into the lethal attack on a flotilla of ships attempting to break the blockade of Gaza, saying it had nothing to hide. Members of Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s inner cabinet, known as the group of seven, voted to take part in the inquiry after two months of sustained international pressure since the raid in international waters, when nine Turkish activists were killed. In a statement, Netanyahu said: &quot;Israel has nothing to hide. The opposite is true. It is in the national interest of the state of Israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world and this is exactly the principle that we are advancing.&quot; The government had fiercely resisted demands for an independent international inquiry, establishing three internal investigations to head off pressure from the UN, Europe and Turkey. The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said Israel&apos;s agreement to participate in the inquiry he is setting up was an &quot;unprecedented development&quot;. It is the first time Israel has agreed to take part in a UN inquiry into actions involving the country&apos;s military. Israel refused to co-operate with a previous UN inquiry, led by the South African judge Richard Goldstone, into its three-week war in Gaza in 2008-9. That inquiry&apos;s findings were highly damning of Israeli actions. The UN panel will comprise the former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer, the outgoing Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, plus a Turkish and an Israeli representative. It will begin work in just over a week and is expected to submit a preliminary progress report in mid-September. The panel will have access to the workings and findings of Israel&apos;s internal inquiries. A statement from Netanyahu&apos;s office said the decision had been taken &quot;in the wake of diplomatic contacts that have been held in recent weeks in order to ensure that this was indeed a panel with a balanced and fair written mandate&quot;. A separate statement from Ban said he had &quot;engaged in intensive consultation with the leaders of Israel and Turkey on the setting up of the panel&quot;. Some analysts suggested there had been extensive behind-the-scenes discussion on the mandate of the UN panel, with considerable input from the Israeli government. The aim, Ban said, was to give &quot;recommendations for the prevention of similar incidents in the future&quot;. He hoped the decision would &quot;impact positively on the relationship between Turkey and Israel as well as the overall situation in the Middle East&quot;. Mark Regev, Netanyahu&apos;s spokesman, said: &quot;Ultimately we are sure the facts are on our side. We have no problem whatsoever with a credible, objective panel.&quot; The attack on the flotilla prompted international criticism of both the raid and Israel&apos;s policy of blockading the Gaza Strip. Israel has since eased its embargo, although still refuses to allow full imports and exports and the free movement of people. The episode brought relations between Israel and its staunchest ally in the region, Turkey, to breaking point, although efforts have since been made on both sides to repair the damage. There has been a debate in Israel since the Goldstone report over whether the government was right to refuse co-operation. Critics of the decision said Israel would have had more influence on the report&apos;s findings if it had participated. The report concluded that both the Israeli military and Hamas had committed war crimes during the three-week conflict. &quot;This decision is important,&quot; said Gidi Grinstein, of the Reut Institute, a Tel Aviv-based thinktank. &quot;Israeli policy for many years has been a &apos;closed tent&apos; approach. Often those critical of Israeli policy have been marginalised. [This decision] reflects a deeper understanding of the requirement to engage with organisations that may be critical of Israeli policy.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T16:28:20Z", "title": "Gaza flotilla raid: Israel to co-operate with UN inquiry", "sentences": ["&quot;This decision is important,&quot; said Gidi Grinstein, of the Reut Institute, a Tel Aviv-based thinktank."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/israel-gaza-flotilla-un-inquiry"}, {"tags": ["Lebanon", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "Rising tension along the Israeli-Lebanese border erupted into a military confrontation today during which three Lebanese soldiers, one Israeli officer and a Lebanese journalist were killed. In the most serious clash since the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah four years ago, shelling and gunfire led the UN to issue a call for maximum restraint from both sides. As the fighting subsided, both sides embarked on a war of words, blaming each other for the confrontation. Three Lebanese soldiers died when an Israeli shell landed near a military vehicle in the border town of Adaisseh, according to Lebanese officials. A Lebanese journalist was also killed by a shell. Lieutenant Colonel Dov Harari, an Israeli battalion commander, was killed and a second Israeli officer was critically wounded in the exchange. Residents in northern Israel reported loud explosions and gunfire. They were advised to take cover in bomb shelters. The Israeli military said its forces came under fire from Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) while carrying out routine maintenance in Israeli territory on the border. The work, it said, had been co-ordinated with Unifil, the 12,000-strong UN force stationed along the Lebanese side of the border since the war ended. Israeli forces returned fire, and an air force helicopter fired shells, damaging several Lebanese armoured vehicles, said the Israeli Defence Forces in a statement. &quot;The IDF holds the LAF responsible for the incident that disrupted the calm in the region, and its consequences,&quot; it said. The IDF chief of staff, Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi, was dispatched to the area. According to Lebanese media reports, the clash erupted when Israeli soldiers tried to uproot trees on the Lebanese side of the border. Saad Hariri, Lebanon&apos;s prime minister, called it a &quot;violation of Lebanese sovereignty and demands&quot;. In a statement he demanded that &quot;the United Nations and the international community bear their responsibilities and pressure Israel to stop its aggression.&quot; Michel Sleiman, Lebanon&apos;s president, denounced the clash as a violation of UN resolution 1,701, which was intended to resolve the 2006 conflict, and called on the Lebanese army to &quot;confront any Israeli aggression, whatever the sacrifices&quot;. Syria&apos;s president, Bashar al-Assad, attributed the incident to Israel&apos;s &quot;criminal aggression&quot;. &quot;Israel is making every effort to shake the stability in the region,&quot; the official Syrian news agency quoted him as saying. &quot;The United Nations and the international community must condemn and prevent the Israeli aggression.&quot; The Israeli foreign ministry said: &quot;Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for the grave incident, and warns of the consequences should these continue.&quot; Analysts said the clash was unusual. &quot;This wasn&apos;t a confrontation with Hezbollah,&quot; said Jonathan Spyer of the Global Research in International Affairs Centre in Israel. &quot;This was an incident in a very tense border area in which there is a permanent sense of crisis, but neither Israel nor Lebanon has any interest in escalating it.&quot; Israel and Hezbollah fought a 34-day war in 2006 after Lebanese militants fired rockets across the border and abducted two Israeli soldiers. Their bodies were returned two years later in exchange for the release of Lebanese prisoners. At least 1,500 people, mostly Lebanese civilians, were killed in the conflict. Since the war ended, Unifil has been stationed in southern Lebanon. There has been speculation in Israel about the possibility of another war. The Israeli foreign ministry said there was &quot;massive rearmament of Hezbollah, including the rearmament of Hezbollah units in southern Lebanon&quot;. But Eyal Zisser of Tel Aviv University said he did not anticipate another war. &quot;It is probably an isolated episode but it shows how tense the situation is. It is in both sides&apos; interest to contain the situation, there is no interest on either side to start a new war.&quot; He added that the strong rhetoric from the Lebanese government towards Israel was contributing to heightened tension. Last month, in detailed briefings to Israel&apos;s media, the Israeli military disclosed previously classified aerial photos showing what it said was a unit of 90 Hezbollah militants storing weapons in hospitals and schools in the village of al-Hiyam. &quot;Hezbollah is establishing itself with increasing strength in the villages,&quot; Colonel Ronen Marley said. &quot;Every day, they are collecting significant intelligence on our forces along the border and every day they are engaged in digging, building and laying communications infrastructure to prepare themselves for war.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T18:05:00Z", "title": "Israeli colonel, three Lebanese soldiers and journalist killed in border clashes", "sentences": ["But Eyal Zisser of Tel Aviv University said he did not anticipate another war."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/lebanon-israel-border-violence-soldiers"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": " 8.50am: Morning folks, and welcome back to our daily sports news blog. Throughout the day we&apos;ll update this page with stories, links and what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we&apos;ll try to post below the line, answering your questions and comments. Today should be rather hectic with the second Test between England and Pakistan kicking off at 11am, the same time the Champions League final qualifying round draw gets underway, as Spurs find out if they will face Sampdoria, Braga, Auxerre, Dynamo Kyiv or Young Boys of Bern. We&apos;&apos;ll have live updates on that, plus the Europa League play-off round draw at 12.30pm. JD  9.09am: Great Britain got their Eurobasket qualifying campaign off to a perfect start on Monday by beating Hungary, but if they&apos;re to get out of Group C they&apos;ll need Chicago Bulls forward Luol Deng to keep dominating the floor like he did on the way to 32 points in that game. Here he is telling Small Talk why he hates vegetables, wants to live in the film Avatar and reckons Cesc F\u00e1bregas will stay at Arsenal. PB  9.25am: Gordon Strachan, a firecracker and a traffic jam all star in this week&apos;s You are the Ref. JD  9.47am: The Liverpool ownership saga rumbles grimly onwards, with a statement on behalf of Kenneth Huang&apos;s bid insisting the Chinese entrepeneur was not about to make Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr rich off the deal. &quot;What is not one of our goals in the enrichment of the existing owners,&quot; said Marc Ganis, whose Chicago-based company Sportscorp Ltd. helped form Huang&apos;s investment group. &quot;If we submit a proposal and it is accepted, it would be focused on the future and not the past.&quot; PB  10.05am: Our live OBO of England v Pakistan is now open for business. Andy Bull should be here soon. JD  10.30am: A couple of quick notes: our Fulham Premier League season preview is now up; and Manchester United have confirmed that Michael Carrick will miss the start of the season after injuring his ankle. He can expect two weeks on the sidelines. And United have also confirmed that Danny Welbeck and Mame Biram Diouf are set to go out on loan: Sunderland and Blackburn, respectively, are expected to pick up the players with deals due to be completed later today. JD  10.35am: England are unchanged in the second Test and bowling after Pakistan won the toss. Follow the latest updates here. JD  10.44am: Right folks, TV coverage of the Champions League play-off draw is set to start from 11am - so with a little bit of luck we should know who Tottenham are playing by early next week. I&apos;ll be here to keep you posted with all the latest from the Uefa jamboree as it gets underway ... PB  10.58am: In the meantime here, for the unititiated, is how it works. The 20 teams left in Champions League qualifying have been separated evenly into two groups - those who won their domestic leagues last season are in the champions section, and those that didn&apos;t the non-champions section. Within each of those sections, five teams have been seeded, and five left unseeded. Seeded teams cannot be drawn against each other. The teams in the champions section are \u2022 Basel (seeded)\u2022 Anderlecht (seeded)\u2022 Copenhagen (seeded)\u2022 Hapoel Tel Aviv (seeded)\u2022 Sparta Prague (seeded)\u2022 Rosenborg (unseeded)\u2022 Red Bull Salzburg (unseeded)\u2022 Partizan (unseeded)\u2022 \u017dilina (unseeded)\u2022 Sheriff Tiraspol (unseeded) The teams in the non-champions section are \u2022 Sevilla (seeded)\u2022 Werder Bremen (seeded)\u2022 Zenit St. Petersburg (seeded)\u2022 Tottenham Hotspur (seeded)\u2022 Ajax (seeded)\u2022 Dynamo Kyiv (unseeded)\u2022 Braga (unseeded)\u2022 Sampdoria (unseeded)\u2022 Auxerre (unseeded)\u2022 Young Boys (unseeded) PB  11am: The upshot of the system outlined in that last post is that Tottenham will face one of Dynamo Kyiv, Braga, Sampdoria, Auxerre or Young Boys. I&apos;d say the first of those teams is definitely the one they&apos;d be most worried about. PB  11.07am: Annoyingly, our Eurosport feed seems to have fallen over, and Sky Sports News are not yet showing the draw. It looks like the draw for the Champions path may have already started, though, as Eurosport&apos;s website is showing that FC Salzburg will face Hapoel Tel-Aviv and Rosenborg are playing Copenhagen. PB  11.10am: Yup, here&apos;s the full champions path draw:  Salzburg v Hapoel Tel-AvivRosenborg v FC CopehagenBasel V SheriffSparta Prague v ZilinaPartizan v Anderlecht PB  11.11am: What&apos;s with all this haste? I demand boring video montages reminding us how great Uefa are and unnecessary award giving to old footballers. Some jamboree this is. PB  11.12am: Oh they&apos;ve only gone and got the softest team in there! To little fanfare, Man With Egg-Shaped Head and Short Man With Glasses pull out the first two teams - and it&apos;s Tottenham v Young Boys! PB  11.14am: Here, then, is the full draw for the non-champions path: Young Boys v TottenhamBraga v SevillaWerder Bremen v SampdoriaZenit St Petersburg v AuxerreDynamo Kyiv v Ajax PB  11.17am: Well that has worked out very well for Tottenham indeed - Young Boys may have knocked out Fenerbahce in the last round but there is no doubting that they were the draw fans will have been hoping for. Sampdoria v Werder Bremen looks like the tie of the round, and unfortunately for Antonio Cassano and chums I&apos;m not sure I fancy their chances. But with Werder&apos;s Mesut Ozil and Samp&apos;s Giampaolo Pazzini both reportedly attracting high-profile suitors, much may depend on the next ten days&apos; transfer activity. PB       11.24am: &quot;Any idea what dates Spurs are now playing,&quot; asks Andy Gledhill. &quot;I assume away in the first leg?&quot; Uefa haven&apos;t released the exact dates yet, Andy, but Tottenham will indeed play away in Bern on the 17th or 18th of August, then the return leg on either the 24th or 25th. PB             11.33am: While all that Champions League lark was going on, Stuart Broad took the first wicket - that of Imran Farhat - at Edgbaston.

Speaking in a lengthy BBC Radio 5 Live interview, alongside his wife, King said:  &quot;If every conviction was 1,000% right then we wouldn&apos;t have a chance to appeal. That would be the final decision. I&apos;m here today and I will fight tooth and nail to clear my name and take it to wherever I&apos;ve got to, if it&apos;s the last thing I do. &quot;I know I&apos;ve made mistakes and I&apos;m not perfect but I&apos;m here today to clarify I&apos;m not a sexual offender, I&apos;m not a sex beast, I&apos;ve never been convicted of sexually assaulting a woman before, I&apos;ve never hit a police officer. A lot of things that were said were totally untrue but I understand why people have that perception because it&apos;s in black and white and it&apos;s in front of you.&quot;  JD  12.50pm: Liverpool have been drawn against Trabzonspor in the Europa League play-off draw.

Haven&apos;t seen any fresh quotes as yet, but we&apos;ll post them here as soon as we do. PB  1.56pm: We&apos;ve got all manner of lunchtime reading popping up on the website, but I can confidently predict that the piece which will garner the most comments is Paul Doyle&apos;s season preview for Liverpool. Kevin McCarra, meanwhile, reckons Fabio Capello had better rejuvenate England if he hopes to justify his reprieve. PB  2.15pm: Here&apos;s that Cesc F\u00e1bregas statement in full:  &quot;Firstly I would like to apologise to all the Arsenal fans for not speaking sooner about my future but I have not known what I was going to do until this moment. I cannot deny that joining a club like Barcelona was not an attractive move for me. This was the club where I learnt my football, it is my home town where my friends and family are and a club where I have always dreamed of playing. &quot;There are not many players in the world who would not want to play for Barcelona. I have had many conversations with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger both in person and over the phone over the last few months and although the content of those conversations will remain private, the conclusion is that Barcelona have had two formal offers rejected by Arsenal. &quot;I am a professional and I fully understand that it is Arsenal&apos;s prerogative not to sell me. I owe a lot to the Club, manager and the fans and I will respect their decision and will now concentrate on the new season ahead with Arsenal. I can assure all the fans that now the negotiations have ended I will be 100% focused on playing for Arsenal. &quot;I am an Arsenal player and as soon as I step out on to the pitch, that is the only club I will be thinking about. I am looking forward to the start of the season and putting this speculation behind me.&quot;  In other words: I wanted to go, but wasn&apos;t allowed to? JD  2.49pm: Phew - busy old day here. England have bowled Pakistan out for 72 and are now getting ready to bat: get the latest with Barney Ronay right now. Meantime, James Dart has prepared this betting preview for the opening weekend in the Football League.PB  3.10pm: Balram Chainrai has been told he can take over Portsmouth for nothing on the not-so-small proviso that he guarantees to pay creditors \u00a316-20m to creditors over the next five years. PB  3.41pm A Thai duty-free magnate is allegedly the man behind a bid for Leicester City, or so his daughter has told the media in Thailand. Leicester have confirmed there is interest in the club. And Warrington&apos;s Adrian Morley has a score to settle in the Challenge Cup semi-final, after Catalans Dragons prop David Ferriol bravely suggested that 34-year-old Morley was &quot;once one of the hardest players in rugby league \u2013 but not any more.&quot;  4.25pm Pakistan&apos;s bowlers are making a game of it in the second Test. Mohammeds Aamer and Asif are proving a real handful. England are two down with 54 on the board, Kevin Pietersen is in needing a score and Imran Farhat has just dropped a relative sitter at second slip to dismiss Jonathan Trott. There were smiles and laughing when Pakistan dropped catches at Trent Bridge, but not this time. Heads in hands stuff as Trott escapes. Andy Bull has all the action live, and you can watch highlights of the morning session from Edgbaston here. Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie believes Tiger Woods is &quot;not mentally with it&quot;. The Scot told Sky Sports he takes no pleasure in it but has concerns the long-time world No1 may not be in shape for the Ryder Cup.

You can read today&apos;s Big Interview here. Today&apos;s Fiver has made it through the legal department in spite of James Dart&apos;s very finest efforts. Cesc F\u00e1bregas has put a face on, not necessarily a brave one, after his aborted, (delayed, failed?) move to Barcelona, and &apos;Arry&apos;s lads drew Young Boys in their Big Cup play-off. Appy &apos;Arry? Not arf. Get your daily dose here. Norwich&apos;s Grant Holt was found guilty of a motoring offence in a confusing incident that may become clearer in future. He didn&apos;t turn up to court, but will he play tonight? The full story here. And David Hopps gives us his take on England taking apart Pakistan&apos;s batting line-up today at Edgbaston.

The Swiss side, who beat Fenerbahce in the third qualifying round, would have almost certainly been Harry Redknapp&apos;s choice of opponents, with Dynamo Kyiv, Braga, Sampdoria and Auxerre the other teams they might have faced. Since the end of last season Young Boys have sold Seydou Doumbia, the 22-year-old Ivorian striker who was their top scorer for the last two seasons, to CSKA Moscow. The Swiss domestic season got under way on 17 July, with Young Boys yet to win after three league games. It is Tottenham&apos;s first foray in Europe&apos;s premier club competition since the 1961-62 season. The first leg will be in Switzerland on 17 or 18 August, with the return at White Hart Lane on 24 or 25 August. Bern&apos;s sporting director, Alain Baumann, described the draw as &quot;the worst that we could have&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s the hardest draw,&quot; he said. &quot;Tottenham is more difficult than Fenerbahce for us. We are very happy to play in the Europa League, if we lose to Tottenham. If we win, we are in the group phase. That&apos;s what we hope, but the chance is very, very little. Can we win? At the moment no, I don&apos;t think so.&quot; Tottenham&apos;s representative at the draw was keen to avoid overconfidence. &quot;I don&apos;t think there was a perfect draw,&quot; the club secretary, Darren Eales, said. &quot;All five teams were quality sides. It&apos;s just up to us now to prepare for it and hopefully find a way through. Perhaps it could have been harder \u2013 with Dynamo Kyiv there&apos;s the travel aspect. The other thing we&apos;ll be pleased about is that we&apos;re at home in the second leg, that&apos;s always an advantage. &quot;It&apos;s really big. I&apos;ve just joined the club and you can imagine the buzz around the place. We&apos;ve got a real chance to get into the group stages. It&apos;s very exciting. We&apos;re keeping our feet on the ground but hopefully we can can get through.&quot; The one person in Bern who would have celebrated the draw is their right-back, Scott Sutter, who was born in Enfield and was a season-ticket holder at White Hart Lane before moving to Switzerland aged 16 to pursue a career in football.

Here are extracts from his evidence:  &quot;I am convinced that at the end of your investigation, it will become clear that the State of Israel and the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) acted in accordance with international law, and that IDF combatants on the deck of the (Turkish-owned ship) Mavi Marmara displayed extraordinary courage in fulfilling their mission and in defending themselves against a clear lethal danger.  &quot;The appearance of the prime minister of Israel before this commission today is the best proof of the standards according to which Israeli democracy operates.  &quot;From the Gaza Strip, Hamas has been raining thousands of rockets, missiles and mortar bombs on the state of Israel, striking at our communities and citizens ... Today, Hamas is stockpiling weapons that can reach Tel Aviv and other distant parts of Israel.  &quot;As part of the effort to prevent weapons entering the Strip, my government has continued the naval blockade policy that was imposed by the previous government during Operation Cast Lead in January 2009, and this pursuant to the limitation and oversight on commercial traffic over the land crossings that were imposed in September 2007.  &quot;Upon taking office as prime minister, I learned that many of our friends in the world were repeating Hamas&apos;s claim that the curbs imposed in 2007 and the naval blockade in place since January 2009 had created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the information in our hands showed clearly that this claim was bogus, that there was no starvation in Gaza nor lack of medication or of other vital goods... &quot;Though there was no humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I decided to ease, gradually, the limitation of commercial traffic across the land crossings. &quot;I did this because gradually, over time, these curbs had become a diplomatic and PR liability, serving a mendacious propaganda assault that began to undermine the support of the international community for our policy of stopping the entry of weapons to Gaza.. &quot;Elements hostile to Israel used the bogus rationale of a humanitarian crisis in order to try to break the naval blockade. &quot;This was and is the main aim of Hamas in its efforts to encourage the various flotillas.  &quot;Beginning on May 14, my office held contacts with the highest levels of the Turkish government. These contacts, and later on contacts between (Israeli) defence minister and Turkish foreign minister as well ... were intended to prevent a confrontation with the Marmara flotilla, and they continued until the eve of the flotilla&apos;s arrival on Gaza&apos;s shores. I similarly appealed to a senior figure in Egypt&apos;s government on May 27 so it would intercede with the Turkish government. &quot;But as the flotilla&apos;s arrival neared, it became clear that the diplomatic efforts would not stop it. &quot;Despite our continuous diplomatic efforts, ultimately the Turkish government did not prevent the attempt by the Marmara to break the naval blockade. All our proposals to route the ships&apos; cargo for a security vetting in Ashdod, and later for transfer through the land crossings to Gaza, were to no avail. Nor did we hear any public message from the Turkish government aimed at calming the excitability of the activists aboard the ship. &quot;It appears that the Turkish government did not see in the prospect of a clash between Turkish activists and Israel, something that clashed with its interests, and certainly not something that would warrant applying effective pressure on the IHH activists.  &quot;I should point out that on the 17th of that month, the Turkish prime minister met the president of Iran, Ahmadinejad, and the president of Brazil for a joint declaration on the matter of the Iranian nuclear deal, which was contrary to the position of the United States and the other permanent members of the security council. Thus Turkey bolstered its solidarity and co-operation with Iran in the days before the flotilla.  &quot;I asked that, as much as possible, the friction (of the interception) be reduced and that supreme effort be made to avoid casualties. I know that this was also the instruction of the defence minister and (IDF) chief of staff.  &quot;I gave a number of directives for limiting the PR damage through various means. &quot;(Yet) the first reports from the incident that circulated in the world claimed that our soldiers killed innocent and clement peace activists. &quot;Only when the video clip was disseminated a few hours later did this lie begin to be exposed. Imagine what had happened had we not had this video clip. &quot;Only then did many understand that our soldiers had been confronted with real threats to their lives, facing a brutal attack with clubs, iron bars, and knives \u2013 and, as you have certainly already been informed, firearms.&quot; ", "publicationDate": "2010-08-09T10:08:35Z", "title": "Netanyahu evidence to Gaza flotilla inquiry: extracts", "sentences": ["&quot;From the Gaza Strip, Hamas has been raining thousands of rockets, missiles and mortar bombs on the state of Israel, striking at our communities and citizens ...

For centuries homosexuality has been taboo; it&apos;s not what nice Jewish boys or girls do. The biblical proscription against &quot;men lying with men as though with a woman&quot; (Leviticus 20:13) is considered the very bedrock of Jewish morality. For traditional Judaism marriage is the highest state of social bonding \u2013 a true union of body and soul. Despite some odd exceptions in biblical and rabbinical literature, (Jeremiah is told by God to stay single, Ben Azzai, one of the greatest of the Mishnaic teachers, remains a bachelor by choice), even celibacy was frowned upon. Part of this opposition was no doubt based on a response to the cultural environment \u2013 pagan in the biblical era, Christian in the rabbinic one. But despite major shifts in sociological contexts, the ban against homosexuality was rigidly enforced throughout the centuries. Whilst in other areas the rabbis often showed great flexibility and understanding, this particular area remained off-limits. In recent years, however, homosexuality, among even the most Orthodox sectors of Judaism, has become a growing feature of contemporary Jewish life. In both America and Israel \u2013 the world&apos;s two largest Jewish communities \u2013 it has not been uncommon for rabbis and others to &quot;come out&quot;, often suffering the consequences that such a confession entails. Moreover, reports of homosexual relations between rabbi-teachers and their students have been a regular feature of news items in both communities. In Israel and the US these behaviours have been the subject of a number of feature and documentary films. Still, it was something of a surprise when, on 22 July, a large group of Orthodox Israeli and American rabbis, teachers, psychologists and community leaders published a &quot;statement of principles on the place of Jews with a homosexual orientation in our community&quot;. The statement, which has some 170 signatories, many of them prominent in their respective communities, took some six months to prepare, undergoing countless revisions. The fact that so many rabbis eventually agreed to issue a joint statement is something a miracle in and of itself. There are no popes in the Modern Orthodox world. Rabbis are respected for their individual learning and their ability to solve current problems in the light of the tradition. For so many authorities to agree to such a radical shift in attitude reflects the seriousness of the issue. The statement declares:  &quot;All human beings are created in the image of God and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect ... Embarrassing, harassing or demeaning someone with a homosexual orientation or same-sex attraction is a violation of Torah prohibitions that embody the deepest values of Judaism.&quot;  Superficially at least this a complete about turn from centuries of deeply embedded prejudices. Neither do the worthy signatories distinguish between &quot;genetic or environmentally generated homosexual behaviours&quot;. Their main message is &quot;our obligation to treat human beings with same-sex attractions and orientations with dignity and respect&quot;. This includes: &quot;affirming the religious right of those with a homosexual orientation to reject therapeutic approaches they reasonably see as useless or dangerous.&quot; Rabbi Benjamin Lau \u2013 one of Israel&apos;s most popular Modern Orthodox rabbis \u2013 observes: &quot;Although the document came out only now, it is the product of 10 years&apos; preparation. Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot in the US and Rabbi Ron Yosef in Israel worked in parallel to bring the statement to fruition. Although it does not herald a change in the religious law \u2013 halakha \u2013 it is meant to be an opening for a public debate on this very complex, multi-faceted issue. We are calling on all Jewish communities to relate to their gay members in a way of dialogue, not violence.&quot; This latter reference could refer to an incident in Israel last year where a gay bar in Tel Aviv was attacked \u2013 killing two and injuring many more. More recently, an apparently romantic affair between two Haredi men ended in murder and suicide. It is thus of interest that last week&apos;s publication also found itself its way into the Haredi press. Rabbi Ron Yosef, who is not only a community rabbi, but also a religious judge, would like his fellow gay people to be accepted within the framework of Orthodox law. This has not happened yet but, as Rabbi Lau observes this bold declaration, which allows for individual communities to decide on their own policy towards gay people, &quot;has started the discussion.&quot; After 3,000 years, it may be time.", "publicationDate": "2010-08-09T12:00:00Z", "title": "Orthodox attitudes to gay people shift | Mordechai Beck", "sentences": ["We are calling on all Jewish communities to relate to their gay members in a way of dialogue, not violence.&quot; This latter reference could refer to an incident in Israel last year where a gay bar in Tel Aviv was attacked \u2013 killing two and injuring many more."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/aug/09/gay-orthodox-judaism-rabbis"}, {"tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "Japan", "Israel", "France", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "I visited the exhibition on images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Face to Faith, 7 August) at the Quaker Friends House in London on Hiroshima commemoration day (6 August) after attending a moving ceremony that\u00a0included speeches from a survivor of the city&apos;s atomic immolation, former London mayor Ken Livingstone, Labour peace activist MP Jeremy Corbyn, and the CND chair, Dr Kate Hudson.

He agreed to be transferred to Michigan for trial. The authorities said that he drove up to his victims, pretended to ask for directions or help with his car, then repeatedly stabbed them. One was bludgeoned with the hammer. All but two of the 18 targets were black. One was Hispanic and one white. Among the victims were a 15-year-old boy out jogging and a 67- year-old man sitting on his doorstep. Abuelazam, a Christian Arab, was arrested at Atlanta airport as he was waiting to board a flight to Tel Aviv. The Israeli press reported that his mother had sent him to the US as a youth but that he returned regularly to his home town of Ramla, a mixed Jewish-Arab working-class town. Abuelazam had been stopped by the police in Virginia last week for a traffic offence but was released after promising to turn up in court over an outstanding arrest warrant for assault. He is alleged to have stabbed and wounded another person later in the day. His mother, Iyam al-Azzam, told Israel radio that her son had called her as he was waiting for the plane and that &quot;he sounded the same as usual, quiet and calm&quot;. &quot;I do not believe these charges are true,&quot; she said. &quot;Elias, my son, is a religious, God-fearing man who always assists anyone who needs help.&quot; Abuelazam lived in Virginia where he married twice and once worked with children at a mental health facility. He also lived in Michigan and Florida.Although the arrested man has not so far revealed any motive for the attacks, the police chief in Leesburg, Virginia, where Abuelazam once lived and where some of the victims were attacked, Joseph Price, said he had little doubt they were racially motivated. &quot;My belief is he selected the victims in Leesburg based on the colour of their skin,&quot; he said. But acquaintances said they were surprised to hear it. &quot;I just can&apos;t see him doing this,&quot; Paul Lozinsky, who worked with Abuelazam at the mental health facility, told the Washington Post. &quot;I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s the type of guy who would do this.

He was jailed for a month on the gun charge. Yesterday&apos;s court hearing was to decide whether Abuelazam could be extradited from Georgia to Michigan.

Sara Netanyahu wrote a letter to Eli Yishai, the hardline cabinet member in charge of the deportation programme, appealing for a review of the controversial decision, which is backed by her husband, Binyamin Netanyahu. &quot;I appeal to you as a mother of two young boys and a psychologist in the public service,&quot; wrote Mrs Netanyahu. &quot;I am asking you, from the bottom of my heart, to ... allow the vast majority of the 400 remaining children to stay in Israel.&quot; The Israeli cabinet voted two weeks ago to deport the children. In a statement following the decision, the prime minister said: &quot;On the one hand, this problem is a humanitarian problem. We all feel and understand the hearts of children. But on the other hand, there are Zionist considerations and ensuring the Jewish character of the state of Israel.&quot; The cabinet, he said, did not want to &quot;create an incentive for the inflow of hundreds of thousands of illegal migrant workers&quot;. Israel has encouraged thousands of foreign workers to take jobs in its construction, agricultural and service industries in the past 10 years, since it barred most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza from employment inside Israel. Some of the foreign workers \u2013 largely from south-east Asia, China and Africa \u2013 have overstayed their visas and settled to rear families. Some also entered illegally. The government estimates there are currently 1,200 children born to around 200,000 migrant workers. After debating the issue for about a year, it decided two weeks ago to allow 800 who have lived in Israel for more than five years, speak Hebrew and attend school to remain; the rest \u2013 most of whom are less than five years old \u2013 will be deported to their parents&apos; home countries. Yishai, a member of the ultra-Orthodox rightwing Shas party, rejected Mrs Netanyahu&apos;s appeal. Earlier he accused migrant workers of using their children as &quot;human shields&quot;. &quot;The foreigners came to Israel, some of them illegally, and gave birth to illegal children here,&quot; he said. Following the decision, defence minister Ehud Barak \u2013 who was absent from the cabinet vote \u2013 publicly dissented. &quot;The state of Israel cannot expel hundreds of children,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not Jewish or humane and will scar the entire Israeli society.&quot; An umbrella organisation of Holocaust survivors also objected. &quot;The state of Israel is ... founded on a Jewish heart and conscience,&quot; it wrote in a letter to the prime minister. &quot;We who experienced the Holocaust were witnesses to the death camp selection and the separation between children and their parents ... We are overcome by a sense of suffocation and shame.&quot; Several thousand people demonstrated against the move in Tel Aviv at the weekend. The children are scheduled to be deported at the end of the month.", "publicationDate": "2010-08-15T17:08:47Z", "title": "Netanyahu's wife protests deportation of migrant workers' children", "sentences": ["&quot;We who experienced the Holocaust were witnesses to the death camp selection and the separation between children and their parents ...

Despite the provocative conclusions reached in this piece, conversation about this possibility is far from new. Whether by intention or not, Goldberg&apos;s article dovetails neatly with a campaign by American war hawks and neoconservatives to push for, if not an American military strike on Iran, an Israeli one. Last month, Reuel Marc Gerecht wrote that an Israeli attack on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities would jolt pro-democracy forces into action, threatening a regime otherwise bent on an obsessive (not to mention, suicidal) quest for Israel&apos;s destruction. And former Bush official Elliot Abrams floated the idea that Arab states would quietly support a strike by Israel. Despite this campaign&apos;s focus on Israel, its intent is not to give leaders in Tel Aviv a case for military action. As Goldberg himself documents, among current and former Israeli officials, the openness already exists. No, as many have shown, this exercise is focused on the United States, and in the near term, means to shift the tone of American conversations about Iran in a more hawkish direction. This should not come as a surprise. Statements from the secretary of defence and the chairman of the joint chiefs cautioning against a military strike have done considerable damage to the &quot;war with Iran&quot; agenda. But by shifting the context to one in which the military option is necessary, even reasonable, proponents of a military strike reason that, at a minimum, they can leave the Obama administration little choice but to adopt a tactic of reminding everyone that all &quot;options are on the table&quot;. Fortunately, there is a path out of this conundrum. First, the administration could remind the war nudgers that the last time bellicosity was an instrument of the United States, only one country benefited: Iran. A 2008 Brookings report grimly summed up the accomplishments of the previous administration&apos;s sabre-rattling:  &quot;Tehran now has acquired the means to influence all of the region&apos;s security dilemmas, and it appears unlikely that any of the Arab world&apos;s crises, from the persistent instability in Iraq and Lebanon to security of the Persian Gulf, can be resolved without Iran&apos;s acquiescence or assistance.&quot;  Not exactly a good result for America&apos;s allies in the Middle East. While the White House is at it, it might also realise that, since 2008, the United States has meaningfully disrupted Iran&apos;s aspirations to become a new regional heavyweight. A new UN security council resolution \u2013 which few commentators thought possible \u2013 has isolated Iran internationally. Thanks to the Russia &quot;reset&quot;, Tehran must also contend with the possibility that it has become more a burden to its &quot;great power&quot; backers than an asset. Furthermore, the US has helped check both Iran and its proxies by beefing up its regional partners&apos; defences, including the largest ever military assistance package for Israel. Last, Iran now struggles to contain unprecedented internal cleavages, some of which emerged because Iranians saw the possibility for a new relationship with America and the world. Tackling the potential threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon will not be easy. A successful outcome is far from certain. Iran&apos;s continued advancement of its nuclear programme, and its vacillation over whether or not it will negotiate, make that clear. But the idea that the military option \u2013 which, if exercised, would have devastating consequences and, as a rhetorical threat, has accomplished nothing \u2013 would enhance the security in the Middle East and for Israel more than its alternatives does not carry water.", "publicationDate": "2010-08-17T13:00:58Z", "title": "Talking up an attack on Tehran | Patrick Barry", "sentences": ["Despite this campaign&apos;s focus on Israel, its intent is not to give leaders in Tel Aviv a case for military action."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/17/iran-israel-military-strike"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Turkey", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Israeli security forces were tonight in place around the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv where a Palestinian man was reported to be holding hostages after shots were fired.

There are 4,992 co-operative and mutual organisations in the UK, each of which is owned and controlled by its participating members and not by those who supply the working capital. Their turnover is over $50bn, they have a total of 12 million members and generate 237,000 jobs. Thus, building societies are owned by savers and mortgage holders, businesses are owned by employees or customers, all on a one-person, one-vote principle, similar to parliamentary democracy. By virtue of such direct ownership, co-operative organisations are unlikely to get into the hands of the short-term profiteers who led us into the credit crunch and subsequent turmoil. Past UK governments, both Conservative and Labour, have favoured capital ownership in the form of equity-share companies and there has been little help for any alternative structure. Because co-operatives are not subject to stock market listing, the financial press tends to ignore them and omits to report their results. If the present government does not support the co-operative model as a significant sector of a mixed economy, the short-term profiteers will rub their hands with glee and take the rest of us into another recession in a few years time, or sooner. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in a message to a conference, From Crisis to a Just and Sustainable World Economy, in London in February 2009, spoke of &quot;a new form of apartheid that threatens civilisation, a widening gap between the richest and the poorest&quot;. He praised capitalism&apos;s dynamism but said that &quot;its victory is surely a pyrrhic one&quot; if we can no longer harness it to benefit humankind in a way that is sustainable. Roger Sawtell Northampton, UK Diamonds in Zimbabwe Petina Gappah may be the one &quot;over-reaching&quot; in her criticisms of human rights organisations exposing ongoing abuses in Zimbabwe&apos;s Marange diamond fields (Zimbabwe can use its diamonds for good, 30 July). Gappah takes issue with a report by Partnership Africa Canada that asserts that the Joint Operations Command \u2013 the country&apos;s top military commanders and Mugabe loyalists \u2013 are using diamond resources to undermine the government of national unity. This is wrong, she claims, because opposition MDC ministers have been actively campaigning alongside Zanu-PF colleagues to have an export ban lifted on Marange diamonds. Her analysis misses the mark. The Kimberley Process Certification System was a response to Charles Taylor and Foday Sankoh, whose reigns of terror in the late 1990s defined &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; for the way in which rough diamonds were allegedly used to finance proxy militias aimed at undermining legitimate governments in west Africa. As PAC&apos;s report argued, this definition is outdated. It erroneously assumes all governments are &quot;legitimate&quot; and does not recognise that such governments could engage in acts of terror as egregious as any rebel movement, as Zimbabwe has done. It also presumes that conflict, as with criminality, is incapable of exploiting new opportunities. In Zimbabwe&apos;s case, it is clear the JOC and other Zanu insiders are using diamond resources to finance an illegitimate agenda. This includes numerous public threats by most JOC members that they would instigate a coup should the MDC ever win an electoral victory. PAC is not alone in its concerns about the undue influence the unelected JOC wields over day-to-day operations of government. Many have expressed similar sentiments, such as Roy Bennett, a senior MDC politician, who declared last month that Zimbabwe is run by a &quot;military junta&quot;, which enriches itself at the expense of democracy and economic development for all Zimbabweans. While Tendai Biti, the MDC finance minister, has indeed been a vocal proponent of diamond exports, the MDC and Zanu are hardly a united front. Nowhere was this more evident that at recent meetings in Tel Aviv and St Petersburg, where the terms under which Zimbabwe could once again resume exports was hotly contested. On both occasions the MDC, despite holding the critical finance portfolio, was not part of the official Zimbabwean delegation. Alan Martin Partnership Africa Canada Ottawa, Canada Violence in Greece There are a few oddities in Helena Smith&apos;s report on threats of violence against tourists in Greece by the Sect of Revolutionaries (Armed group tells tourists: Greece isn&apos;t safe, 6\u00a0August). First, it seems strange to describe as &quot;anarchist-oriented&quot; a group that calls itself a &quot;sect&quot;. All the anarchists in my acquaintance have been exuberantly anti-religious and would run far before using a religious term to describe themselves. Second, while violence has not been unknown to anarchists in history, the choice of an investigative journalist as a target needs explication. Some anarchists are pacifists but those that will use the &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; usually target tsars, presidents and prelates rather than investigative journalists. Third, the sample of written material provided by the Sect of Revolutionaries reads more like a fascist pronunciamento than anything revolutionary. The naked appeal to force, the categorical rejection of politics and the devaluation of innocent lives are more redolent of fascism than anarchism. The current situation in Greece reminds me of Italy in the 1970s and 80s. There, atrocities like the 1980 Bologna massacre were first ascribed to anarchists, but turned out to be the work of fascist groups pursuing, with government support, what they called a &quot;strategy of tension&quot;, which they hoped would provoke a military coup d&apos;etat. Geoff Mullen Sydney, Australia Crime and punishment In Women priests criminalised (23 July), you state that the &quot;attempted ordination&quot; of women is considered by the Vatican as an offence on a par with sex abuse of minors. I can well imagine an AD30 Christ finding the idea of a female priest inconceivable, just as that of the abolition of slavery. Should we therefore reintroduce slavery? And does the Vatican really think that those who attempt ordination of women should have &quot;a heavy millstone fastened round [their] neck&quot; and &quot;be thrown into the sea&quot; like &quot;whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in [Christ] to stumble&quot; (Mark 9:42)? Amy Gibson Sassetot-le-Mauconduit, France \u2022 David Garland, professor of law and sociology at New York University, writes that the death penalty has its benefits because &quot;In a nation where the prison system is so overused that the currency of imprisonment is largely devalued, the death penalty allows juries to make an emphatically punitive statement&quot; (Five death penalty myths, 6 August). This is like saying that in a country where flogging is so overused and therefore devalued, stoning allows the public to make a more emphatic statement. Is this what law, and sociology, has come to in America? Charles Thorpe La Jolla, California, US Christianity and churches The headline of the most interesting article by Alison Flood (6 August) was most misleading. Instead of Anne Rice quits Christianity, wouldn&apos;t it have been more correct to say Anne Rice quits the Catholic church? After all, the article reports that Anne Rice stated that &quot;faith in Christ was &apos;central&apos; to her life&quot;. With that statement I totally concur, and like Rice I find I am unable to become a member of any church, even though I work for the Open Bible Trust and am chairman of Churches Together in Reading. Different denominations have their own particular doctrines, but thinking people with a personal faith can find themselves unable to sign the &quot;statement of faith&quot; of any church. Also, at times, they find they are out of step with statements made by the leadership of that church. None the less, I still think churches are worth supporting for in spite of their failings, ones common to all human organisations, they are a source of much good in their communities. Here I am thinking particularly about the relatively new Street Pastors initiative, which has helped many young people who get out of their depth on Friday and Saturday night revelries. Also by staying within the church, even though not a member, one can bring some pressure for change. Being outside, one loses all influence. Michael Penny Reading, UK Briefly \u2022 One phrase in cartoonist Steve Bell&apos;s apologia (6 August) leapt off the page: &quot;the torrent of preposterous rubbish issuing from radio and any other media&quot;. Indeed! So when will Steve and his colleagues go after the egotistical radio, TV and, yes, print professionals who serve up warmed-over political wisdom on a daily basis? Politicians are not the only people who sometimes deserve our scorn.

It must renounce violence, recognise Israel and abide by previous agreements\u00a0between Israel and the Palestinians. At no point has Hamas satisfied these conditions \u2013 or indicated any intention to do so. Those who advocate talking to Hamas are urging a Groucho-Marxist policy in a complex, unstable region. If Hamas is too extreme to accept these principles, they argue, we must tailor our principles to match Hamas&apos;s extremism. The Hamas charter advocates the destruction of the state of Israel, the genocidal slaughter of Jews and the imposition of an Islamic state governed by sharia law. When an organisation&apos;s constitution venerates your murder, it is difficult to know how negotiations should begin \u2013 perhaps with a discussion of the flowers for one&apos;s funeral. This week marks the fifth anniversary of Israel&apos;s disengagement from Gaza. We withdrew every Israeli soldier and citizen, gambling on the formula of land for peace. Instead of peace and progress we received missiles and misery. Hamas made Gaza a terrorist enclave, launching thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians. In 2006 it kidnapped Gilad Shalit, holding him in isolation for four years without a single visit from the Red Cross. In a bloody coup in 2007 Hamas attacked its own people, chasing Fatah out of Gaza and hurling its Palestinian brothers from the rooftops. It imposed an Islamic penal code along with the routine torture and execution of political opponents. Simultaneously it relentlessly attacked Israelis and, with Iranian support, stockpiled weapons that today can hit Tel Aviv. After years of missiles, the bombardment became unbearable. We targeted the terrorist infrastructure through Operation Cast Lead. Israel has tried to stop the flood of weapons through a naval blockade. When Hamas supporters attempt to break the blockade, as occurred with the Turkish IHH flotilla, Israel&apos;s defensive measures must be understood in context. Hamas recently fired a Grad missile at Ashkelon and dispatched a terror cell from Gaza into Sinai that fired missiles at Eilat in Israel, and Aqaba in Jordan: Hamas threatens not only Israel but also Egypt and Jordan. Some in the west fondly refer to Hamas as the elected representatives of the Palestinians. While Hamas won the Palestinian council elections in 2006, it was not a mandate to violently overthrow the Palestinian Authority. Nor does it justify terror against Israel. Hamas&apos;s concept of democracy fits that of all democratically elected dictatorships \u2013 &quot;one man, one vote \u2026 once&quot;. Gaza was a golden opportunity tragically missed. Instead of building a Mediterranean Dubai, Hamas diverted every resource to enslaving its people while attacking ours. In contrast, Israel and the PA have made significant progress in the West Bank, reducing roadblocks, easing access and stimulating economic growth of 8%. The PA should be encouraged to build on these developments at the negotiating table. Israel has offered direct talks, recognised a two-state solution and introduced an unprecedented moratorium on settlement construction. President Abbas has declined talks, preferring to campaign against Israel internationally. In Palestinian classrooms and civil society incitement against Israel continues. Our experience following the Gaza pull-out has scarred the Israeli public. Hamas&apos;s missiles wounded the concept of land for peace, increasing Israeli fears and scepticism. Of the same voters who elected governments that signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and initiated the Oslo Accords, only 32% believe talks with the Palestinians will lead to peace. More than ever, Israelis require confidence-building measures. When Israelis feel secure concessions follow. Last weekend Israel dismantled the security barrier in Gilo, a Jerusalem suburb that came under heavy Palestinian sniper fire during the second intifada. If in Gilo no sniper fire means no wall, so in Gaza no missiles would mean no blockade. It is that simple. Sadly Hamas has always torpedoed peace efforts through suicide bombings, kidnappings and missiles. If further steps towards peace are to win Israeli hearts and minds, the price cannot be missiles and mortars in the heart of Israel.", "publicationDate": "2010-08-20T09:00:33Z", "title": "Before we talk to Hamas | Ron Prosor", "sentences": ["Simultaneously it relentlessly attacked Israelis and, with Iranian support, stockpiled weapons that today can hit Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/20/israel-hamas-peace-talks-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Gap year travel", "Backpacking holidays", "Ethical holidays", "Family holidays", "Cycling holidays", "Volunteering", "Australasia holidays", "Israel holidays", "Saudi Arabia holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Cambodia holidays", "Travel"], "article": "Cycling to India When I was 11, during a junior school leavers&apos; assembly in front of all the mums and dads, my headmistress asked my class what they wanted to do when they left school.

On my own. Carrying everything I needed on my steel-framed bicycle, affectionately known as &quot;Shirley&quot;. I would like to say it was planned to the nth degree and that everything ran like clockwork. In reality, I was arrested twice, chased by wild dogs, beaten (and wined and dined) by the mafia, attacked by bandits \u2026 On my last day I was cycling through the Bandipur wildlife park in southern India. My flowery bike wasn&apos;t great camouflage and startled a number of elephants as I passed. They decided to charge. The advice is &quot;if an elephant charges you, stand your ground, and bow your head to show respect&quot;. What tosh! With 30 tonnes of muscle and bone crashing towards me, destroying small trees and making the ground vibrate under my feet, there was no way I was standing firm. I dropped my bike into third gear and floored it. Another time I ran out of food and water in the desert and was woken one morning to find maggots in my hair and beard. Yet the greatest memories are of so many wonderful people I met in every country, who invited me into their homes to celebrate local festivals, play music, dance, sing, eat, and share each other&apos;s cultures, beliefs, history and way of life. After six months&apos; cycling, I rolled into Chembakolli, a tiny village, my final destination. It was my 31st birthday \u2013 20 years since I had first dreamed up the idea. I was greeted by a carnival of people playing drums, singing, cheering, and waving banners saying &quot;Happy birthday&quot;. All I could do was crouch down and cry tears of joy.

See his blog at mrbent.blogspot.com  Conservation protest camp in Tasmania I was on a year out in Australia, and after a few months in the red centre I decided to go to Tasmania to escape the heat, and to see big trees. The island is home to a vast forest of Eucalyptus regnans, the largest flowering plants in the world. Within a few days of arriving I heard word of protest activity in the Upper Florentine Valley, a pristine corner of virgin forest under threat from various logging projects. I decided to hitch there, and for the last part of the journey I rode with TK, a Canadian biologist who had been living at the Florentine camp for two years. He gave me a brief history of the area as we entered the forest. These Eucalyptus regnans, at 60m tall, may not be the biggest trees in the world \u2013 one California redwood is 98m, for example \u2013 but never, TK assured me, would I feel as dwarfed by nature as when among the giants of the Florentine Valley. The protest has been going on since 2006, when Forestry Tasmania began extending the road into the forest. Protesters live in the trees so that they won&apos;t be cut down, though there has been much confrontation and some arrests. &quot;Don&apos;t ever go in there,&quot; TK said as we passed a lonely, redbrick pub. &quot;If they think you look like one of us \u2013 a week or so at the camp should do it \u2013 they&apos;ll kick the shit out of you.&quot; The local climate is incredibly wet, adding a ghostly white cover to the giant trees. Rain-soaked banners high up in the branches \u2013 &quot;Toot for Tassy&apos;s Forests&quot;, &quot;Still Wild, Still Threatened&quot; \u2013 were visible from the roadside. But no amount of neck-craning can quantify the trees&apos; size. For an eco-friendly backpacker, the Florentine camp provided a cheap and exciting alternative to a volunteer project. Bring food donations, good conversation and a useful pair of hands and the vast Tasmanian wilderness is yours to explore. Camp life was centred on communal meals, firewood runs, clean-ups and lookout reports. Each night, wet hair and cloth steamed by a campfire under a blue tarpaulin. Plates of food were passed around \u2013 curried baked beans topped with fresh parsley. A camp veteran of six months told me how she was humbled by a spectacular light display from the aurora australis. Another veteran had a doctorate in zoology, and used the camp as a base for a statistical project on the Tasmanian devil population. I spent a couple of days on the west coast&apos;s Bay of Fires \u2013 a wild, windswept clash of white-sand beaches, turquoise water, brooding skies and red-stained granite rocks. As well as being a good place to become actively involved in forest conservation, the camp was where people shared travellers&apos; tips \u2013 a valuable resource that is often ignored in favour of a guidebook.Clyde Macfarlane, 23, anthropology graduate/freelance writer, Chichester.

It is two years since I returned from Jeddah, but when I close my eyes on a grey English day I&apos;m walking the city&apos;s ancient streets again, seeking out Bukhari chicken or Egyptian flat bread. Money was my motivation for going to a country famous for exporting oil and terrorism; it has some of the best paid English teaching jobs in the world, and I managed to save \u00a38,500 in just six months working at a boys&apos; school there. I chose my new home city carefully. As the gateway to Mecca, through which the Muslim world passes on the hajj, the port of Jeddah is Saudi Arabia&apos;s most cosmopolitan and liberal city. My new Saudi friends warned me against even visiting the capital Riyadh, home of Wahhabism. In Jeddah I knew Saudis, as well as western women, who walked the streets unaccompanied by a man and with their heads uncovered, something they could never do in Riyadh. Jeddah also boasts some of the world&apos;s best coral reefs. Diving on the Saudi side of the Red Sea offers the same underwater riches as the Egyptian Sinai, but without the crowds. On the downside, I didn&apos;t speak to a woman for my first two months there, but I eventually found a private beach where the sexes could mix. My first lesson on a jetski was fleeing the coastguard. A Palestinian girl had taken me for a ride when we saw their ship approaching. For fear of being caught together we hid in a cove. Women are barred from driving any kind of motorised vehicles so I had to take the controls and when they passed we sped out of the cove and back to the beach James-Bond style. Bizarre experiences inform my anecdotes about Saudi Arabia \u2013 gate-crashing a wedding and ending up on stage in front of 2,000 guests, my Saudi girlfriend&apos;s mother catching us at my apartment together \u2026 But what I long for is visiting the crumbling, centuries-old buildings of Old Jeddah, smoking shisha in coffeshops and sipping sweet Adeni tea with a friend.

I went for the riyals but came back richer in so many other ways.David Trayner, 29, news reporter, Leicester  Finding my own volunteer work and inspiration in Asia In October 2008 two friends and I started our gap year in Thailand. We began in Bangkok, where we shopped non-stop on Khao San Road, then moved to Koh Samui to learn Muay Thai kickboxing, and up to Pai for yoga and massage courses. We went across to Laos for cooking lessons, and it was here that I went into a school and helped with English lessons. I&apos;d always been put off volunteering by the idea of having to pay a company to work for nothing, but this was free. We moved onto Vietnam, and back to marathon shopping, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling it. I&apos;d got a taste for doing something &quot;better&quot; and I wanted to do more of it. So I left my mates and went ahead to Cambodia. The day I arrived I found an HIV orphanage called House of Family, where I volunteered. I asked the doctor what happened to all the other orphans \u2013 there were only 30 kids at the orphanage but the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia is among the highest in Asia. She explained that they were living at the rubbish dumps, so that is where I went. I discovered children eating dirt, sleeping on dirt and walking barefoot on burning toxic waste. It was inhumane and unacceptable. So I came back to England, borrowed a video camera, raised \u00a31,000 on Facebook and returned two weeks later to do the first Small Steps project. I gave wellington boots, clothes aid, food and water to the children. Then I came home, edited the film, screened it and got an amazing reaction from the public. I registered Small Steps as a charity and intend to repeat the project \u2013 called Around The World in 80 Dumps \u2013 on inhabited dumps around the world, to create awareness and help people. I am now the director of Small Steps, the next project is in Nicaragua. Amy Hanson, 30, London.

But as I sat in front of the easyJet website this summer I couldn&apos;t quite bring myself to double the size of my carbon footprint for the year with just one click. Instead, I decided I&apos;d rely on my thumb and the kindness of strangers and take a risk on that most controversial form of transport, particularly for women: the hitchhike. A friend would accompany me as far as Zagreb, then I&apos;d go on alone to Israel, through Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Three hours after posting a request on the website Gumtree (gumtree.com) we had a lift from Hounslow East in London to Mannheim in southern Germany. A week and three lifts later, we were couchsurfing (couchsurfing.org) in Berlin. We became pros at working service stations, asking every car that pulled in whether they had space for two travellers: &quot;You go?&quot; \u2026 point at map, smile, get in. There were BMWs, a limousine and a Slovenian rocking out to Pink Floyd. In some cars, especially after a night spent camping just off the hard-shoulder, my head would droop and 12 hours later I&apos;d wake to realise I&apos;d missed an entire country (sorry Slovakia, Bulgaria and northern Israel), but the further east I went, the more unfamiliar the scenery became and the more often my eyes would stay open. Even the worst experience could turn into a high point. We were dropped just north of Munich in the rain as it was getting dark, and were stuck for two hours, soaking wet, our spirits low. A couple in a people-wagon finally saved the day. They planned to drop us at a service station where we could hitch a lift into Austria. We talked and joked about small things \u2013 the scenery, the baptism that they&apos;d been to. I told them about my year as a parish administrator and the reverence that the baptism register commanded. By the end of that conversation they had decided I was a girl with an unambiguous calling who had put faith on hold to struggle against climate change. It turned out the man was a Protestant priest, and rather than drop us at a service station to pitch our tent in the rain, they offered us a night in their spare flat in the Bavarian mountains \u2013 hot water, fresh towels, beds all to ourselves, and for free \u2013 bliss. I spent over a month in the Middle East and saw sights that the guidebooks are yet to discover. Relying on the famed Syrian kindness, I was taken in, fed and cared for by a family for four days. They then drove me most of the three hours to Mar Musa monastery, enjoyed by few travellers. In Israel I lost myself in the carefree parties of Tel Aviv, making friends with kids who&apos;d just finished military service (&quot;Who cares about peace? We just want peace of mind&quot;). The next day I went to Jerusalem to yell in protest with the activists in the West Bank. I was given access to both worlds, the only condition that I would listen to the stories that they told about the other side. And it was this necessity to listen that made my decision to hitchhike so much more than just a cheap way to travel. Each was an invitation to get close to someone. Hitchhiking is the start of a story where anything might happen. You escape the check-in queue and have faith in the moment, in people and yourself. You begin a story with each person you meet. Living another person&apos;s life, if only for one journey, will teach you more about their culture than any guidebook.Tamsin Omond, 25, environmental campaigner, London. Follow her @tamsinomond on twitter Working on a farm in Scotland For many of my generation, the gap year between school and university was spent volunteering in orphanages or sunning on an Aussie beach. Being pretentious but poor I decided instead that my fate lay on a Scottish island. I had been to Mull on holiday and figured I would spend my days wandering the beach, reading epic novels and having flings with strapping farmers. I was a troubled teenager, desperate to escape the woes of life in a remote Kentish village, terrifyingly clueless about my career path. When I told her my plans, my mother, somewhat spitefully, said, &quot;How on earth are you going to do that?&quot;, which galvanized me into asking the tourist office if there were any friendly farmers. Fortune had it that I managed to speak to a girl called Claire, a conversation that changed my life. Claire knew of just the man, a farmer in the south of Mull who periodically &quot;took in&quot; young folk like me to help out on his 22,000 acres. Our brief phone call (he had an impossibly posh accent) went something like this: &quot;Have you ever worked on a farm?&quot; &quot;Erm, nope.&quot; &quot;Know anything about farming?&quot; &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;Are you fit?&quot; &quot;Not particularly&quot; &quot;I like your chutzpah. I&apos;ll pay your coach fare. If we like you, you can stay.&quot; I stepped off the ferry in cropped, dyed red hair, round glasses, ripped jeans and Dr. Marten boots, prompting the farmer to squint at me in disbelief and ask if I was a punk. Lochbuie \u2013 where I lived \u2013 is a 17-house village, beautiful and appealing to holidaying wildlife lovers, archaeologists and photographers. Sites include the uninhabited 15th-century Moy Castle and the impressive (inhabited) 18th-century Lochbuie House, overlooking the loch. Mull remains one of the most beautiful, unspoilt places in the UK. I returned recently and nothing had changed. I hated it for the first few weeks. But the farmer and his wife persevered through my astonishing ignorance about the world and I went from self-obsessed teenager who&apos;d never done a day&apos;s work in her life (bar the sort that you could give up if you didn&apos;t like it) to a useful (ish) member of the community. I emerged at the end of the experience fitter, fatter, better-read and able to sleep. Hazel Davis, 33, journalist, Huddersfield Family gap year We lived in Cornwall in a beautiful barn conversion with stunning valley views and only a short drive to the glorious Atlantic coast: my wife Nicki, with a beauticians business in Wadebridge, 15-year-old Michael, addicted to Xbox games, Emmaline, 13 going on 19, and me, John, full-time artist. Wanting to see the world had been nagging at me for years. In the end we decided to just do it. The kids could be schooled as we travelled and the experiences they&apos;d get would be possibly life-changing \u2013 hell, we might even find somewhere better to live than Cornwall. Having sold everything to fund the trip we had just three weeks to prepare, decide where to go and buy our round-the-world tickets: we opted for Japan, south-east Asia, Australia, New Zealand, a stop in the Cook islands and finally the United States. The furthest we&apos;d ever been prior to this was Bulgaria. We flew to Tokyo the day after Boxing Day, and stayed with a family in rural Japan, eating sushi with them each day and trying to communicate with gesticulations and props \u2013 sake seemed to help the conversations somewhat. Dressed in traditional kimono and samurai we visited Buddhist and Shinto temples on New Year&apos;s Day. We went on to learn to dive in Thailand, helped out at a charitable school in Cambodia, camped in the Australian outback and skied in August in New Zealand. But constantly moving on every few days can be exhausting, especially for kids, so sometimes we&apos;d just slob and watch DVDs in a rented apartment. The experiences have been so many and varied, and has been highly rewarding for the whole family. We&apos;ll have plenty of stories to &quot;entertain&quot; our friends and relatives at Christmas when we return in December.John Tregembo, 52, Cornwall. See his travel blog at johntregembo.co.uk.

The word was &quot;occupation&quot;. &quot;I really felt like someone was speaking the unspoken,&quot; she recalled last week in a Tel Aviv cafe. &quot;It was really shocking to me. There was graffiti saying, &apos;end the occupation&apos;. And I felt like, OK, now I can talk about what I saw.&quot; Michelzon became one of a handful of former Israeli servicewomen who have spoken out about their military experiences, a move that has brought accusations of betrayal and disloyalty. It is impossible to know how representative their testimonies are, but they provide an alternative picture of the &quot;most moral army in the world&quot;, as the IDF describes itself. Concerns about Israeli army culture were raised last week following the publication on Facebook of photographs of a servicewoman posing alongside blindfolded and handcuffed Palestinians. The images were reminiscent of the Abu Ghraib scandal in Iraq. But the former soldier, Eden Abergil, said she didn&apos;t understand what was wrong with the pictures, which were described by the IDF as &quot;ugly and callous&quot;. Israel is unique in enlisting women at the age of 18 into two years of compulsory military service. The experience can be brutalising for the 10% who serve in the occupied territories, as Michelzon did. &quot;I left the army with a ticking bomb in my belly,&quot; she said. &quot;I felt I saw the backyard of Israel. I saw something that people don&apos;t speak about. It&apos;s almost like I know a dirty secret of a nation and I need to speak out.&quot; Michelzon, now 29, began her military service in September 2000, just when the second intifada was breaking out. &quot;I joined the army with a very idealistic point of view \u2013 I really wanted to serve my country.&quot; She was posted to Erez, the crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, to work in the radio control room. &quot;There was a lot of tension, a lot of shootings and suicide bombings,&quot; she said. &quot;Little by little you understand the rules of the game. You need to make it hard for the Arabs \u2013 that&apos;s the main rule \u2013 because they are the enemy.&quot; She cited a routine example of a Palestinian woman waiting at the crossing. Michelzon called her officer, asking permission to allow the woman through. She was told to make such a request once the woman had been kept waiting for hours. &quot;I felt very alone in the army. I couldn&apos;t talk about the things I felt were misplaced,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t have strong views but I felt uncomfortable about the talk, about soldiers hitting Arabs and laughing. I thought everyone else was normal and I was the one who wasn&apos;t. I felt an outsider to the group experience.&quot; At the end of her service, in June 2002, Michelzon said she felt the need to escape and took off to India. &quot;I went through a breakdown little by little,&quot; she said. It was only when she returned to enrol in university, and two years of therapy, that she began to consider her &quot;duty&quot; to speak out. She also came across Breaking the Silence, an organisation of army veterans who publish testimonies from former soldiers on life in the occupied territories to stimulate debate about the &quot;moral price&quot; of the occupation. Michelzon gave evidence to the group and two years ago appeared in a documentary, To See If I&apos;m Smiling, about the experiences of young women in the army. The film, she said, was criticised by all sides. The left focused on &quot;the bad things we did and not on the fact that we wanted to start a discussion. We wanted to put up a mirror and tell Israeli society to look itself in the eyes. &quot;From the right, the reaction was, why are you doing this to your own people? Do you hate your country? But I did it because I love my country. We had to fight to say we want to talk about the political situation.&quot; The psychological impact of military service on women is undeniable, according to the testimonies of Michelzon and others, particularly those who serve in the occupied territories. &quot;If you want to survive as a woman in the army, you have to be manly,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no room for feeling. It&apos;s like a competition to see who can be tougher. A lot of the time girls are trying to be more aggressive than the guys.&quot; Her experience is echoed by that of Dana Golan, who served in the West Bank city of Hebron in 2001-02 as one of about 25 women among 300 male soldiers. Like Michelzon, Golan only spoke out after finishing her service. &quot;If I had raised my anxieties, it would have been seen as a weakness,&quot; she said. Golan, now 27, said the &quot;most shaky moment&quot; of her military service came during a search for weapons in a Palestinian home. The family were awoken at 2am by soldiers who &quot;turned their whole house inside out&quot;. No weapons were found. The small children of the house were terrified, she recalled. &quot;I thought, what would I feel if I was this four-year-old kid? How would I grow up? At that moment it occurred to me that sometimes we&apos;re doing things that just create victims. To be a good occupier, we have to create\u00a0conflict.&quot; On a separate occasion she witnessed soldiers stealing from a Palestinian electronics shop. She tried to report it, only to be told &quot;there were things I shouldn&apos;t interfere with&quot;. She said that she also saw elderly Palestinians being humiliated on the streets, &quot;and I thought these could be my parents or grandparents&quot;. Israel is discomfited by these testimonies, she said, partly because of the universality of military service. &quot;We grew up believing the IDF is the most moral army in the world. Everyone knows people serving in the army. Now when I say we are doing immoral things, I am talking about your sister or your daughter. People do not want to hear.&quot; The IDF is proud that 90% of its roles are open equally to men and women. &quot;Serving in a combat unit where you have daily contact with people who might do you harm is not easy \u2013 you have to be tough,&quot; said Captain Arye Shalicar, an army spokesman. &quot;It&apos;s not only a female thing, it&apos;s the same for everyone. In the end, a combat unit is a combat unit. Sometimes things happen, not every deed is 100% correct or fair.&quot; The army, he said, has procedures for reporting misdeeds which soldiers are encouraged to follow. Both Michelzon and Golan have no regrets about speaking out. &quot;For two years I saw people suffering and I didn&apos;t do anything \u2013 and that&apos;s really scary,&quot; said Michelzon. &quot;At the end, it felt like the army betrayed me \u2013 they used me, I couldn&apos;t recognise myself. What we call protecting our country is destroying lives.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-21T23:06:26Z", "title": "Israeli army's female recruits denounce treatment of Palestinians", "sentences": ["&quot;I really felt like someone was speaking the unspoken,&quot; she recalled last week in a Tel Aviv cafe."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/22/israel-female-soldiers-gaza-occupation"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Israel", "Jordan", "Belgium", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Second world war", "Europe"], "article": "Though Reginald Levy, who has died aged 88, was a former RAF bomber pilot with a distinguished second world war record, his most celebrated moment in the air came quite unexpectedly in 1972. By then, Levy was living in Slough, Berkshire, and working as a captain with the Belgian airline Sabena. His plan for his 50th birthday, on 8 May that year, was to celebrate with dinner in Tel Aviv, accompanied by his wife, Dora. On his birthday, he was flying a Boeing 707, with Dora and 89 other passengers, from Brussels to Lod airport, near Tel Aviv, via Vienna. Twenty minutes after takeoff from the Austrian capital, and at 30,000ft, Levy&apos;s career collided with the Israel-Palestine conflict. Two men asserting membership of the Palestinian Black September Organisation (BSO) broke into the cockpit with pistols and a grenade, while their comrades, two women with plastic explosives, remained in the cabin. The BSO was born of, and officially disclaimed by, Yasser Arafat&apos;s Fatah. It took its name from that month in 1970 when the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its allies, having challenged the Jordanian state, were crushed by King Hussein&apos;s forces. Previous BSO operations had included the assassination of Jordan&apos;s prime minister Wasfi al-Tal, sabotage in West Germany and the Netherlands, and the attempted assassination of Jordan&apos;s ambassador to London. &quot;As you can see,&quot; Levy calmly announced to the passengers, &quot;we have friends on board.&quot; A coded message alerted the Israelis to the hijack. After the 707 landed at Lod, commandos disabled the airliner under cover of darkness. Meanwhile, the Israelis \u2013 led by the defence minister Moshe Dayan \u2013 filibustered talks with the hijackers, with the latter calling in the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The hijackers&apos; intention was to fly on to Cairo, with the passengers and the 10-strong crew, who, they said, would be freed following the release of 317 jailed Palestinian guerrillas. Dayan vetoed some Belgian suggestions to pay a ransom. The Israelis were determined that the plane was going nowhere. Meanwhile, when the four hijackers discovered the 707 had been immobilised, Levy was left to spend the night in conversation with them, about everything, he recalled, &quot;from navigation to sex&quot;. In the morning the hijackers sent Levy to the Israelis with fragments of explosives to show their serious intent. The pilot meanwhile briefed the Israelis, was briefed in return \u2013 and returned to the plane. Dayan, having indicated that the hijackers would get their way, sent in 18 white-overalled &quot;mechanics&quot; to &quot;check&quot; the 707. The 18 commandos were led by the future Israeli prime minister (now defence minister) Ehud Barak, and included the current prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Within two minutes, the two male hijackers were dead. Both women were captured \u2013 one was injured, as were six passengers, one of whom died later. That September came the BSO&apos;s attack on the Munich Olympics and the death of 11 Israeli athletes. In the aftermath of the affair, Levy and his wife did get to have dinner, first with Dayan, and subsequently with the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. Levy was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, but raised largely in Lancashire, where his Jewish father, Cyril, was a cinema manager. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute high school for boys and Blackpool grammar school. In 1940, Levy joined the RAF and crossed the Atlantic to train with the US Army Air Corps. Back in England, he was posted to No 105 Squadron at Horsham St Faith, near Norwich, flying Mosquito IV twin-engined light bombers. In November 1942, having been injured by anti-aircraft fire over northern Holland, he flew the damaged aircraft back, on one engine. The remaining engine failed over East Anglia, the bomber crashed into a wood, and yet Levy and his navigator survived. From the summer of 1943 until January 1944, Levy flew four-engined Halifax heavy bombers out of Snaith, East Yorkshire, with No 51 Squadron. His missions included the first night of Operation Gomorrah (24/25 July 1943), the 10-day devastation of Hamburg; Operation Hydra (17/18 August), the raid on the Peenem\u00fcnde rocket research centre on the Baltic; and the bombing of Berlin on the night of 28/29 January 1944. His plane was hit \u2013 while raiding Mannheim \u2013 by a Luftwaffe nightfighter, and, over Hanover, a bomb from another aircraft plunged through his Halifax, without detonating. He spent the rest of the war as an RAF flying instructor. His postwar work took in an instructorship with the newly created Air India, the Berlin airlift in 1949, and a spell from 1950 with the Belfast-based aviation company Short Brothers. Then in 1952 he joined Sabena, where he remained until 1981. Levy had been awarded a wartime DFC. Following the hijacking, he was made a chevalier of Belgium&apos;s Order of the Crown. He had married Dora in 1943 \u2013 they met when she was a Women&apos;s Auxiliary Air Force flight sergeant. They retired to Dover and she predeceased him in 2005. He is survived by his daughters, Linda and Susan, sons Peter and Anthony, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \u2022 Reginald Levy, pilot, born 8 May 1922; died 1 August 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-08-23T17:47:12Z", "title": "Reginald Levy obituary", "sentences": ["His plan for his 50th birthday, on 8 May that year, was to celebrate with dinner in Tel Aviv, accompanied by his wife, Dora.", "On his birthday, he was flying a Boeing 707, with Dora and 89 other passengers, from Brussels to Lod airport, near Tel Aviv, via Vienna."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/23/reginald-levy-obituary"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "Sport", "Champions League 2010-11"], "article": "Anticipation is growing ahead of the Champions League draw hosted by that bloke with the hair and the teeth and the nice lady with the pout at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco at 5pm, so here&apos;s a quick run through the rules.

If I&apos;ve had a bit too much to drink and I sing along, I find a southern accent I never knew I had. And if a Jewish girl can discover a southern accent for herself in Gainesville, anyone can find a home there. Right? Then I remember.  When I was a child, some of my evangelical Christian classmates urged me to convert. Because I was Jewish and didn&apos;t accept Jesus Christ as my personal lord and saviour, they told me, I was going to hell.\u00a0 When I was a teenager, I had a close friend whose father was in the Ku Klux Klan. For years, I hid my ethnic and cultural background from the family. Shame began to seep into me and I learned to hide my roots from everyone.  The summer after 11th grade, we were home alone, watching a movie with an African American friend of ours. The gravel in the driveway rumbled under a car&apos;s tires \u2013 it was my other friend&apos;s father, the Klansman, arriving unexpectedly. Our black friend hid in a closet. He climbed him out the window later and I met him down the road, tucked him into my car, and drove him home.\u00a0 My last year of high school, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in a local park that happened to be less than a mile from my house. As I left to go for a run, my mom warned me to steer clear of the park. Just in case.  An obedient daughter, I respected her wishes. When I heard later that counter-protesters outnumbered the KKK, I felt a thrill in my chest. This is my hometown.  I felt the same this morning when I read that the city of Gainesville had rejected Jones&apos;s request for permission to build a bonfire. While the city denied that the decision had anything to do with Jones&apos;s intention to burn sacred books, Gainesville&apos;s mayor, Craig Lowe, voiced his discomfort with Jones&apos;s ideology.  So, which is my hometown? And which is America? Gainesville&apos;s struggle is a mirror for the country. And so are my memories. In the past, there was antisemitism, roiling just below the surface.

But they&apos;ve qualified now and it&apos;s nice to see a new English team contesting group stages that can often verge on the interminably dull.  In the Sky Sports News studio: Simon Thomas in the chair, with guests Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Charlie Nicholas.  Kicking back over in Monaco: Richard Keys and Andy Gray.  4.45pm: &quot;Holding off the challenge from Fenerbah\u00e7e last year, Bursaspor won the league for the first time last year - so exciting times ahead for them in the Champions League,&quot; writes Nazim Dikbas, who originally wrote in to correct my avant-garde spelling of &quot;Buraspor&quot;. &quot;They have already won their first two league games this season (one against Galatasaray in Istanbul, 2-0) and they have an intelligent and level-headed coach in Ertu\u011frul Sa\u011flam.

They can&apos;t play each other. Expect better from you, frankly.&quot; That&apos;s me told. Imagine how outraged David would be if I&apos;d done something really terrible, like put a cat in a bin.  4.56pm: Incidentally, David&apos;s wrong - Barcelona, being from a different country to Madrid, can of course be picked in the same group as them. That&apos;s my story and I&apos;m sticking to it.   Jordan Hackney writes: &quot;Do you think Richard Keys might have waxed the upper part of his chest to be able to get away with the no tie, open shirt approach?&quot; he asks. &quot;Also is there the possibility of seeing Nick Collins on the beach getting ice cream in his moustache or will he be backdropped by luxury yachts in a harbour?

Nuff said.&quot; I think there&apos;s a very good chance Spurs could win or come second in their group.

Nice girl.  5.08pm: The Club Goalkeeper of the Year award goes, unsurprisingly, to Brazil&apos;s Julio Cesar. &quot;What happened to the good old days of draws with Trevor Brooking and Peter Shilton picking the FA cup ties, dropping balls and then sucking their teeth and shaking their heads with wry smiles when they draw Man Utd v Leeds?&quot; asks Matthew King. &quot;All over and done with in 10 minutes with a bit of low-carb banter and they had 64 teams to handle. UEFA are rubbish. Imagine how they&apos;d do a tombola at a school fete.&quot;  5.10pm: Julio thanks God for his award, which is good of him. &quot;I&apos;m always taken aback by comments such as those by David Payne, 4:51pm,&quot; writes JT Lawley. &quot;What do people expect when they see your name at the top of the MBM? We all know you love football but hate everyone who plays it, commentates on it, watches it, organizes it, or has any other passing interest in it. I fully expect you to call me a bollocks for this, by the way, but isn&apos;t that the point?&quot; I would never use such language in a minute-by-minute report. It&apos;s against Guardian policy and it&apos;s rude.  5.11pm: Gary Lineker takes to the stage to help them begin the draw. Will he make a joke about his resemblance to the trophy? Will he?  5.12pm: Surprisingly, no. Right, here we go ...  5.14pm: Sorry, I forgot they have to go through the usual nonnsense about fair play, irregular betting patterns and all that, before explaining the rules of the draw. Here&apos;s an email from Philip Genochio. &quot;David Payne&apos;s email is quite the most witless thing I&apos;ve read on this site,&quot; doing David a grave, grave injustice, considering some of the tripe I&apos;ve contributed over the years. &quot;And, unlike him, I&apos;ve read a lot on here. Will you be putting him back once you&apos;ve got the hook out of his mouth, or putting him out of our misery? As for Spurs qualifying for the group stages... I&apos;m fully expecting the Italian, Spanish, German et al press to make a beeline to White Hart Line to learn more about these plucky underdogs. You know, in the same way you lot have been patting Blackpool on the head for the last few weeks. Expect stories about how, legend once has it, Spurs had a meagre two points from eight games a few season ago, yet here they are battling against the likes of Barca, Inter, Bayern etc.&quot;  Group A Inter, Werder Bremen, Tottenham Hotspur, FC Twente  Group B: Lyon, Benfica, Schalke, Hapoel Tel Aviv  Group C: Manchester United , Valencia, Rangers, Bursaspor Group D: Barcelona, Panathinaikos, Copenhagen, FC Rubin Kazan Group E: Bayern Munich, Roma, FC Basel, CFR Cluj Group F: Chelsea, Marseille, Spartak Moscow, MSK Zilina  Group G: AC Milan, Real Madrid, Ajax, Auxerre  Group H: Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk, SC Braga, FK Partizan  5.23pm: Wow, what a rush. That&apos;s the first pot done with, a remarkably slow process. I&apos;ll continue adding the teams in that block there, but first it&apos;s time to dish out the award for Club Defender of the Season. Germany&apos;s Andreas Brehmer is doing the honours; I have never worked with his niece.  5.25pm: Again, no surprises. The winner is Maicon, from Inter. &quot;Mention of Zubizarreta&apos;s niece reminds me that I went to school with his nephew, a charming fellow called Daniel Mar Molinero who wound up producing b-sides for singles from Gareth Gates second album,&quot; writes Ben Hendy. &quot;I&apos;m not sure if being a Spanish goalkeeper&apos;s nephew or having that career is the bigger claim to fame, frankly.&quot;  5.26pm: &quot;Do you think Lineker looks a bit annoyed that he&apos;s just drawing letters and teams?&quot; asks Jordan Hackney. &quot;The complicated system here is slightly reminiscent of Alan Partridge&apos;s Soccer Metre from the day today.  5.28pm: &quot;I&apos;m not too worried about your comments regarding Spurs so far but if you dare to suggest we&apos;ll end up finishing 8th in our group after our inevitable decline midway through the competition I&apos;ll be very cross indeed,&quot; writes Adam Jones. Right, eyes down for more draw, it&apos;s off to pot No2.  More evidence that football started in 1992, writes Matthew King. &quot;I&apos;ve been reading today about how Spurs will be thrilled to finally entertain the big clubs of Europe at White Hart Lane like Real, Barca and Bayern Munich. What? Like the early-mid 1980s then?&quot;  5.35pm: So, two pots down and two to go - the next one stars Tottenham Hotspur and Rangers. Time for some Club Midfielder Award action. Gianfranco Zola makes his way on stage to present the gong.  5.37pm: And in another sensational upset, the winner is ... Wesley Sneijder. &quot;Can&apos;t they do all this in silly frocks and tight trousers like Eurovision?&quot; inquires Gary Naylor. &quot;All the managers could be lumped together in one big room with a roaming camera to catch Jose just as he sees RM drawn with Inter. Such an approach would be excellent outreach towards football&apos;s much ignored gay demographic, so it would tick a box too.&quot;  5.40pm: Hold on to your hats Spurs and Rangers fans. Your time has come ...  5.46pm:  So, Tottenham are in with Werder Bremen, Inter and AN Other, while Rangers get Manchester United, Valencia and AN Other. Dust off those battle of Britain headlines. Mancunians will be reaching for their tin hats - remember what happened the last time Rangers visited Manchester in a European football competition? Yikes. They&apos;re lovely fans, mind. Just misunderstood.  5.49pm: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is introduced and crowns Diego Milito the Club Forward of the Year, making it a clean sweep for Inter players.

Or invite Jose Mourinho on for an interview only to ask him a longish question, and then cut him off, Dame Edna style, by saying &apos;Sorry Special One, but it seems we&apos;re out of time&apos;.&quot;  6.05pm: &quot;I&apos;m sure you follow him anyway Barry, but apparently Tim Lovejoy tweeted earlier that he thought Spurs would end up in Chelsea&apos;s group,&quot; writes Max Dowler, between sniggers. &quot;What a man he is.&quot; Well, um ... I&apos;m sure he knew it was impossible. I did, after all, predict Spurs would be in the same group as Barcelona and Real Madrid.  6.10pm: &quot;This might sound surprising, but I really think Arsenal have the toughest group out of all the top seeded english teams,&quot; writes Jamad, who&apos;ll surprise Charlie Nicholas, who couldn&apos;t disagree more. &quot;Braga and Shakter play the same type of football Arsenal play and if they don&apos;t turn up I could see them going out. They will probably end up going through. Good draw for the english teams except for Spurs.&quot;  6.10pm: &quot;Think yourself lucky as here in Saudi Arabia we have the combined wisdom of Scott Minto, Tim Sherwood and Iain (Mr Incredible) Dowie,&quot; writes Paul Muir. &quot;I don&apos;t even have alcohol to numb the pain :(&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-26T15:08:05Z", "title": "Champions League draw - as it happened | Barry Glendenning", "sentences": ["Pot 1 InternazionaleBarcelonaManchester United ChelseaArsenalBayern MunichAC MilanLyon Pot 2 Werder BremenReal MadridAS RomaShakhtar DonetskBenficaValenciaMarseillePanathinaikos Pot 3 Tottenham HotspurRangersAjaxSchalkeBaselBragaCopenhagenSpartak Moscow Pot 4 Hapoel Tel AvivFC TwenteRubin KazanAuxerreCFR ClujFK PartizanMSK ZilinaBursaspor  4.35pm: After all their prepoterously over-the-top celebrations for finishing fourth in last year&apos;s Premier League, it was disappointing to see Tottenham qualify for the group stages, as this time yesterday, the sight of their players and fans wiping copious amounts of egg of face, was a far more amusing prospect than that of them getting landed in a group with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Germany.", "Expect stories about how, legend once has it, Spurs had a meagre two points from eight games a few season ago, yet here they are battling against the likes of Barca, Inter, Bayern etc.&quot;  Group A Inter, Werder Bremen, Tottenham Hotspur, FC Twente  Group B: Lyon, Benfica, Schalke, Hapoel Tel Aviv  Group C: Manchester United , Valencia, Rangers, Bursaspor Group D: Barcelona, Panathinaikos, Copenhagen, FC Rubin Kazan Group E: Bayern Munich, Roma, FC Basel, CFR Cluj Group F: Chelsea, Marseille, Spartak Moscow, MSK Zilina  Group G: AC Milan, Real Madrid, Ajax, Auxerre  Group H: Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk, SC Braga, FK Partizan  5.23pm: Wow, what a rush."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/26/football-champions-league-draw1"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Middle East peace talks"], "article": "Hot town, summer in the city \u2013 and Tel Aviv residents have far better things to worry about than peace negotiations. The party season is in full swing in the heart of the Bu&apos;ah (Bubble), as Tel Aviv is condescendingly known. Tourists throng the beaches and bars, business is booming throughout the sun-drenched streets and all signs suggest that the good times are here to stay. As far as I can tell, the perennial hostilities with the Palestinians barely register with the average Tel Avivian; a lull in terror attacks on major Israeli cities coupled with a sky-rocketing economy defying the global downturn reinforces the feelgood factor in the country&apos;s de facto capital. Far from being on the lips of the chattering classes, the coming talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders are attracting much less attention on the domestic front than the international media circus would imply. While residents of Israel&apos;s border towns have good reason to perpetually fear for their safety, the &quot;chessboard effect&quot; keeps the half million-strong population of Tel Aviv feeling vastly more confident about their own security. As in a game of chess, where the first aim of defence is to surround the king with several pawns and a rook, the security wall and the ring of troops around the Israeli heartland has helped to achieve the same thing. The conflict has been by and large pushed out to the edge of the board \u2013 down south in Sderot, up north in towns along the Lebanese border and in settlements throughout the occupied territories. While violence is breaking out in the West Bank in protest at the resumption of talks and settlers fret about whether the construction freeze will finally end, the silence from within mainstream Israel is deafening. The prime reason is the lack of contact they have with either Arabs residing in Israel or Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. Having spent six years living in Jerusalem and Jaffa, where there is at least some degree of interaction \u2013 however frosty \u2013 between Jews and Arabs, moving to the heart of the bubble has been a shock. With some rare exceptions, every face I pass is Jewish, every conversation I hear is in Hebrew and little to nothing penetrates the thick walls of homogeneity in which we are all safely ensconced. Speaking to Israeli neighbours and friends in central Tel Aviv, they have an almost uniform approach to the conflict: &quot;they&quot; want to destroy &quot;us&quot;; consequently Israel has no choice but to keep the fires of war forever burning. Such an attitude is not necessarily born of malice, but is undeniably selfish; putting themselves in the shoes of either fellow Israelis on the country&apos;s periphery or Palestinians languishing in Gaza and the West Bank seems either too painful or too abstract. Army service was the last contact many of my peers had with either Palestinian people or territory and they seemingly harbour little desire to go back to discover for themselves the truth behind the military propaganda. In media circles, the prospects for the new round of peace talks are viewed as bleak by all but the most blindly optimistic observers: far too many hurdles stand in the way for serious headway to be made by either side and the region&apos;s long history of missed opportunities seems doomed to repeat itself. At street level, however, there is not even a sense of positivity or negativity to be weighed \u2013 instead, indifference is the dominant emotion, and it&apos;s somewhat understandable why that should be. Unless residents of Israel&apos;s cosseted centre seek urgent change from their leaders, it&apos;s hard to see how momentum can develop that might bring an end to the status quo. Life will remain as comfortable as ever for a select minority, and as harsh and harrowing for an unfortunate majority on both sides of the divide. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-08-27T11:30:05Z", "title": "Peace talks yet to burst Tel Aviv 'bubble' | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Hot town, summer in the city \u2013 and Tel Aviv residents have far better things to worry about than peace negotiations.", "The party season is in full swing in the heart of the Bu&apos;ah (Bubble), as Tel Aviv is condescendingly known.", "As far as I can tell, the perennial hostilities with the Palestinians barely register with the average Tel Avivian; a lull in terror attacks on major Israeli cities coupled with a sky-rocketing economy defying the global downturn reinforces the feelgood factor in the country&apos;s de facto capital.", "While residents of Israel&apos;s border towns have good reason to perpetually fear for their safety, the &quot;chessboard effect&quot; keeps the half million-strong population of Tel Aviv feeling vastly more confident about their own security.", "Speaking to Israeli neighbours and friends in central Tel Aviv, they have an almost uniform approach to the conflict: &quot;they&quot; want to destroy &quot;us&quot;; consequently Israel has no choice but to keep the fires of war forever burning."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/27/peace-talks-tel-aviv-bubble-israel"}, {"tags": ["David Grossman", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "In May 2003, David Grossman, one of Israel&apos;s most celebrated novelists, began writing a new book. It was to be about what the Israelis euphemistically call &quot;the Situation&quot;, which was a little odd because, for the past decade, he&apos;d carefully avoided writing about politics, in his stories, if not his journalism. It was not just that he&apos;d long felt that almost anything he could say had already been said by one side or the other. There was the danger that such a story, even in his deft hands, would be creaky and polemical. Now, though, he felt suddenly that he couldn&apos;t not write about it. Grossman&apos;s eldest son, Yonatan, was six months from completing his military service and his younger son, Uri, was 18 months from beginning it. His feelings about this \u2013 in Israel, men serve three years \u2013 were so acute, it seemed they would push the pen over the paper for him. The story came quickly. It would be about a middle-aged woman, Ora, whose son, Ofer, only just released from army service, has voluntarily returned to the frontline for an offensive against one of Israel&apos;s many enemies. Ora, having moved from celebration to renewed fearfulness in a matter of hours, is in danger of losing her mind. She has no idea how she will get through the next weeks or months. Then, in a fit of magical thinking, it comes to her. She will mount a pre-emptive strike of her own. She will simply go away, absent herself from her home and her life. That way, she reasons, she will not be there when the army &quot;notifiers&quot; come to tell her of her son&apos;s death. And if she is not there, perhaps he will not die. After all, how can a person be dead if his mother isn&apos;t at home to receive the news of it? Grossman started writing and as he did, he, too, indulged in a little magical thinking. He had the feeling \u2013 or perhaps it was just a fervent hope \u2013 that the novel would keep Uri safe. Every time Uri came home on leave, they would discuss the story, what was new in the characters&apos; lives. &quot;What did you do to them this week?&quot; Uri used to ask. He also fed his father useful military details. This went on for a long time and it seemed for a while as if the charm was working. But on 12 July 2006, following Hezbollah attacks on Israeli soldiers on patrol near the Lebanese border, war broke out. Over the course of the next 34 days, 165 Israelis (121 of them soldiers), an estimated 500 Hezbollah fighters and 1,191 Lebanese civilians were killed. Grossman was terrified for his son, a tank commander, but he was not, at first, opposed to the war. Though a determined lefty as far as Palestine goes \u2013 he is against the occupation of Palestinian territories \u2013 he believed that Israel had a right to defend itself against Hezbollah which, unlike the majority of Palestinians, is committed solely to destroying Israel. As the weeks went on, however, he began to think that Israel should show more restraint. At the beginning of August, together with two other great Israeli writers, Amos Oz and AB Yehoshua, Grossman appeared at a press conference in Tel Aviv, demanding that the government negotiate a ceasefire. &quot;We had a right to go to war,&quot; he said. &quot;But things got complicated... I believe that there is more than one course of action available.&quot; He did not mention that his own son was on the frontline. It was not relevant. He would have felt exactly the same had Uri been safely at home. The Israeli government eventually accepted a UN-brokered ceasefire which came into effect on 14 August. But this was too late for Grossman and his family. On 12 August, in the dying hours of the war, Uri, who was just 20 years old, was killed when his tank was hit by a rocket; he and his crew, who were killed with him, were trying to rescue soldiers from another tank. The notifiers came to Grossman&apos;s house at 2.40am. He heard the voice over the intercom, and he knew what was coming. Between his bedroom and the front door, he decided: &quot;That&apos;s it \u2013 life&apos;s over.&quot; But the strange thing is, it was not. The Grossmans buried Uri; his father&apos;s simple but piercing eulogy was reprinted in newspapers around the world, including the Observer; and then the family sat shiva (a period of mourning during which time a Jewish family receives visitors). The day after the shiva ended, Grossman returned to his book. &quot;I went back to it for an hour,&quot; he says, surprise registering on his face even now. &quot;Then I had to come back home. But the next day, I added 10 minutes, and the day after that, another ten. Yes, it was hard. I was going straight to the place that frightened me most. On the other hand, it was the only possible place for me.&quot; The result \u2013 To the End of the Land \u2013 was published in Israel in 2008 and arrives here, in the most beautiful translation, this week. What can I tell you about this book? I&apos;m not sure. Only that I loved it. And that it tears at your heart. And that when I heard someone comparing Grossman with Tolstoy, and his novel with War and Peace, I did not scoff. It is blazing hot in Jerusalem and, as usual, the city is a knot: tight with anger, cinched with frustration. The traffic is so heavy, it takes a taxi 20 minutes or more to move a single kilometre, but walk to your destination, as I&apos;ve just done, and your dress will be sopping wet, the straps of your sandals will have flayed your feet like whips. Forget the holy sites, the bearded priests and the shawled rabbis. On a day like today, the visitor seeks the blessing only air conditioning can bestow: cool, crisp and calming. I meet Grossman in a coffee shop in Mishkenot Sha&apos;ananim, a venerable Jewish neighbourhood just outside the Old City walls. The view from the window is of a pomegranate tree, the Hagia Maria Sion, formerly known as the Abbey of the Dormition, where the Virgin Mary is said to have fallen into eternal sleep and, following the curve of the next hill, the sombre grey line of the barrier that separates the citizens of Jerusalem from those of the West Bank. The room is deliciously cold, (goosebumps are already rising on my shins), but the calm I feel, the sense of benediction, is all to do with Grossman. He once said that the effect of regular wars and prolonged uncertainty can be seen in the way Israelis drive (people are prone to honking their horns and yelling out of their windows). But you can no more imagine him going mad at an intersection than you can picture him inviting Binyamin Netanyahu out for beer and pizza. Grossman radiates wisdom, modesty, kindness and, above all, a sort of stillness: contemplative and tender, but steely, too. This is not to say that the darkness is all behind him. He warns me that there are some things he cannot talk about, will perhaps never be able to talk about, and I cannot look at his heart-shaped face, his big, marsupial eyes, without worrying about manhandling him. Grief, inasmuch as I&apos;m acquainted with it, makes a person feel, among many other things, like an over-ripe peach, prone to bruises and watery leaks. For his own part, he likens it to exile. &quot;The first feeling you have is one of exile,&quot; he says. &quot;You are being exiled from everything you know. You can take nothing for granted. You don&apos;t recognise yourself. So, going back to the book, it was a solid point in my life. I felt like someone who had experienced an earthquake, whose house had been crushed, and who goes out and takes one brick and puts it on top of another brick. Writing a precise sentence, imagining, infusing life into characters and situations, I felt I was building my home again. It was a way of fighting against the gravity of grief.&quot; The merest flicker of a flinch. &quot;This used to be so hard to express... but now, when I talk about it, I feel able to say that it was a way of choosing life. It was so good that I was in the middle of this novel, rather than any other. A different book might suddenly have seemed irrelevant to me. But this one did not.&quot; Grossman&apos;s heroine, Ora, whom the American novelist Paul Auster has already likened both to Tolstoy&apos;s Anna, and Flaubert&apos;s Emma Bovary, decides to hike in Galilee for the duration of her country&apos;s latest war. She takes with her an old love, Avram, a veteran of the Yom Kippur war and a former PoW. While they walk, they talk. She tells him about Ofer, describing her boy at every stage in his life, carefully bringing him to life (Avram has never met him). Slowly, an absence becomes a presence. The novel, then, works as kind of memorial: not only to Uri, to whom it is dedicated, but to Ofer, who may, or may not, be dead. After Grossman had finished writing it, he handed it to Yonatan, and to his wife, Machal (he also has a daughter, Ruti, but she was too young for this book at the time). &quot;It wasn&apos;t easy for them to read it,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it was only the second time they read it that they understood that it could be a source of comfort to us all. I&apos;m not describing our family, but there are always moments [when the two collide]. And yes, when someone dies, they&apos;re gone and yet they are still so present.&quot; Four months after Uri&apos;s death, Grossman addressed a crowd of 100,000 Israelis who had gathered to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. His speech was beautifully controlled, but quietly furious. He denounced Ehud Olmert&apos;s government for a failure of leadership, a failure which would ultimately damage the Jewish state, and he again argued that reaching out to the Palestinians was the only hope. &quot;Of course I am grieving,&quot; he said, anxious that Olmert and his cronies might dismiss his speech as the outpourings only of a bereft father. &quot;But my pain is greater than my anger. I am in pain for this country and for what you and your friends are doing to it.&quot; I understand that he wants to separate his grief and his politics, but does he think, now, that his loss has changed some people&apos;s opinions of him all the same? &quot;Yes. There were people who stereotyped me, who considered me this naive leftist who would never send his own children into the army, who didn&apos;t know what life was made of. I think those people were forced to realise that you can be very critical of Israel and yet still be an integral part of it; I speak as a reservist in the Israeli army myself.&quot; His novel provoked a strong reaction in Israel. &quot;Some of my books in the past have aroused hatred [notably his collection of reportage, The Yellow Wind, a sympathetic account of life in the occupied territories]. Not this one. I think this one allowed people to give up on the need to be a fist, to remember the nuances, to ask themselves: what does it mean to be a human being in this situation? Our curse is that all of us become representatives; we congeal. But we need to feel our inner doubts, our contradictions.&quot; Was it horrible having to grieve in public? He must have feared that his son would be adopted as yet another symbol of the Situation. &quot;I&apos;m not sure it was horrible. One burden is at least taken away [when you are a public figure]: you don&apos;t have to tell people what happened, because they know. We found our way. We&apos;re very private people. We are a close family and we have a wonderful, devoted group of friends. What happens outside that... well, it depends how people approach me. Most approach me with tenderness and sensitivity. There has been a lot of warmth. But I made it clear from the beginning that I don&apos;t ask for special privileges. I don&apos;t want people to say: ah, because he suffered this, his opinions are this. My opinions are not my emotions. I spoke in Rabin Square, but I only do [public] things that I would have done before. &quot;I&apos;m not a rational, cold person. On the contrary, so much of the politics is emotional here, and the two peoples involved are very emotional, so you must be attuned to emotions very precisely. But the bottom line must be logical. You must not surrender to the primal urges of revenge. I just do not see a better solution than the two-state solution. I&apos;m more sad, and maybe desperate, but not in a way that paralyses me.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Maybe I cannot afford the luxury of despair. Maybe. Or maybe it&apos;s a question of personality: I cannot collaborate with despair because it humiliates me to do so.&quot; All the same, he cannot feel hopeful at the prospect of more (American-brokered) talks. &quot;I think our prime minister is the only person who can change our destiny for the better. He has a lot of credibility here. The question is: does he really believe in peace with the Palestinians? And I&apos;m afraid that the answer is no. Even if he taught himself to utter the words &apos;two-state solution&apos;, he deeply mistrusts the Palestinians.&quot; David Grossman was born in Jerusalem in 1954; he is the elder of two brothers. His mother, Michaella, was born in Palestine; his father, Yitzhak, emigrated from Poland with his widowed mother at the age of nine. &quot;My mother&apos;s side of the family was religious and Zionist,&quot; he says. &quot;They were poor. My grandfather paved roads in the Galilee, and he used to buy and sell rugs; my grandmother was a manicurist. On my father&apos;s side, well, there was this little sweet grandmother, so wrinkled, so tiny. She came after she was harassed on the street by a Polish policeman. This woman. She&apos;d never before even left the little region where she&apos;d been born. But she took her daughter and her son, and she took a bus, and a train, and a boat and she came to Palestine at the end of the war and cleaned rich people&apos;s houses. And she wasn&apos;t even religious!&quot; Grossman&apos;s father was first a bus driver, then a librarian, and it was thanks to him that his small son \u2013 &quot;a reading child&quot; \u2013 was able to indulge his love of books. He grins. &quot;He gave me many things, but what he mostly gave me was Sholem Aleichem.&quot; Aleichem, who was born in Ukraine, is one of the greatest writers in Yiddish, though he is now best known as the man whose stories were the inspiration for Fiddler on the Roof. Grossman&apos;s father, like many men of his generation, never spoke of what he had left behind. &quot;Then, one day, he gave me a book by Sholem Aleichem, and he said, &apos;This is how it used to be over there.&apos; Why do I remember it? Because the expression on his face was one I hadn&apos;t seen before. It was the smile of a child. I started reading. The books are in archaic language and I struggled. But I kept going because I felt: this is the code for my father. I read them all. I devoured them. I inhaled them. I read them as a child today would read Harry Potter. And I was sure that the shtetl continued to exist parallel to my life in Israel. Only when I was nine, and we were marking Holocaust Day at school, did it occur to me that this was not the case. I remember standing on the hot asphalt in my white shirt and my black trousers and I heard all these big words: victims, six million and so on. And I thought: they&apos;re talking about the people in Sholem Aleichem. You see, the Holocaust belonged to the adults. When you entered a room, they would stop talking. Sometimes, you&apos;d overhear something: he lost his first family in Treblinka. But what was Treblinka? Where had he lost them? Would he find them again? So, suddenly, to understand the immensity of the loss... all the people I&apos;d read about, they&apos;d vanished, just like that. I was really shocked!&quot; Grossman had an aunt who&apos;d been in Auschwitz and her camp number was tattooed on her arm. &quot;When I was a child, it haunted me. I put it in a novel. The character thought the number was like the code on a safe and that if he could only crack it, a new grandfather, warm and friendly, would jump out of his old grandfather. When I got married, my aunt covered her number with a sticking plaster, so as not to cast gloom over the day, and I must tell you that is still one of the strongest memories of my wedding. My heart flew out to her. I thought: how terrible it is that you feel you must be apologetic about what was done to you.&quot; In 1967, when Israel won the Six Day war, Grossman was 13. He remembers it vividly and believes that the memory helps him to understand some of the resistance on the part of Israel to ending the occupation. &quot;If you want to understand, you have to go there; you can&apos;t deny it. The month before the war, I thought I was not going to live. I took the Arabs very seriously, just as I take them now. I heard a voice on their Hebrew propaganda station promising to come and kill us and to rape our mothers and to throw us into the sea. Then, the first night of the war, when Israel demolished their airforce, and it was clear we were going to win, there was this switch. To feel this miracle! To know we were strong and that after only six days we had become an empire. &quot;You could see how it changed the way people walked and talked. The arrogance of the talk! The sexual connotations that they used to describe what we did to them! I remember my first visit to a newly occupied place. It was two minutes away from here, in the Old City. I want to be very precise. I don&apos;t want to beautify my actions. The Arab population was overwhelmed and they looked at us with a mixture of fear and asking for mercy. We walked in their streets and we felt like gods. For the first time in our 2,000-year history, we were the strong ones. It&apos;s very hard to resist that. We indulged ourselves in all the feelings we had been deprived of.&quot; In 1971, Grossman began his national service. &quot;I worked in intelligence and most of it I liked. I left home, I was independent. I felt I was doing something important, that I wasn&apos;t doing anything against my principles.&quot; He served in Sinai, where there is more sand than people, and although he was in the army when the Yom Kippur war broke out in 1973, he saw no action. Where did he stand politically by this time? &quot;It was a few more years before I started looking at reality, at the places where we are wrong, where we have gone towards the abyss. Only gradually did I start to formulate what was wrong, and what should be done; it wasn&apos;t easy. It didn&apos;t make me very popular among my close friends and family. It was a lot to do with my wife and her family [he and Machal, a psychologist, met while doing military service]. They acquainted me with other ways of seeing this reality.&quot; So she agrees with you? Laughter. &quot;No, I agree with her!&quot; What about his children? &quot;They are OK. They come with me every week to the demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah [in east Jerusalem]. We are demonstrating against settlers taking over houses in Palestinian neighbourhoods, but it&apos;s a kind of weekly reserve service against the occupation, too. Sometimes, it gets violent. Some weeks ago, we were beaten by the police.&quot; How dare they beat David Grossman? He smiles. &quot;I don&apos;t know if they know me at all.&quot; After university, Grossman began working in radio, where he&apos;d once been a child actor, eventually becoming an anchor on the Israeli equivalent of the Today programme. In 1988, however, he was sacked for refusing to bury the news that the Palestinian leadership had declared its own state and, for the first time, conceded Israel&apos;s right to exist. &quot;They were so nasty to me. It was a little scary. I found myself in the middle of this very public affair, my name on the front pages. It was talked about in the Knesset. But I learned a lot about how a big organisation can act against an individual, and it was also a blessing because I had to turn completely to writing.&quot; Had he always known he would be a writer? &quot;Yes. I knew it from a very young age. The first time I met my wife, this is what I told her. It was something physical, a piece of a jigsaw falling into place.&quot; Since then, his work has been translated from the Hebrew in which he always writes into 30 languages and he has won numerous prizes. He is unstoppable. Since delivering To the End of the Land, he has written a children&apos;s book, an opera for children and a handful of poems. &quot;I feel poetry is more the language of grief than prose.&quot; I tell him that every time I travel to Israel, peace feels further away. He doesn&apos;t disagree. &quot;People who are born to war, programmed by war, their entire vocabulary is taken from war. Each step by the other side is regarded as a trick, or a trap, or a manipulation. It&apos;s tragic and we might not have the power to redeem ourselves from it. This is why we desperately need help from the outside. Time and again, we choose warriors to lead us, but maybe by always choosing warriors, we doom ourselves always to be in wars. Neither side wants to do what will benefit the other. They will take out one eye only so long as the other side loses two. Israel stands at a crucial point in its history, each step possibly fatal. But the way forward is so psychologically demanding, so threatening, we are stuck.&quot; He thinks the Israeli boarding of the Turkish boat bound for Gaza last May \u2013 nine activists were killed \u2013 was pure folly. &quot;It was stupid. We had months to prepare. Why did we choose the belligerent way? Allow them in! Even if there had been terrorists onboard, it wouldn&apos;t have changed anything. Just show some sympathy.&quot; Meanwhile, life in Israel grows somehow narrower. Grossman&apos;s Arabic is almost as fluent as his superlative English, but it is harder and harder to maintain links with Palestinian friends, let alone to travel there. &quot;I spoke three weeks ago to a dear friend, the writer Ahmad Harb...&quot; He sighs. &quot;Between us, there is the mutual disappointment of people who had a common dream and who saw it evaporate. But I know he continues to fight in his society exactly as he knows I do in mine. We are like two groups of miners digging from either side of a mountain; we know we will meet in the end.&quot; The settlers? They are distorting an Israeli idealism he still holds dear. &quot;The emotional investment we put into the occupation! As Gershon Sholem said, &apos;All the blood goes to the wound.&apos; We are not taking care of ourselves. We are looking in the wrong direction. The settlement movement might really ruin us.&quot; Grossman longs for Israel to be more than just a shelter for the Jewish people; he wants it to be a home. &quot;And it will not be a home unless we have peace with our neighbours. In a home, you&apos;re comfortable, you breathe with both lungs. Here, we breathe with only one and we are suffocating. Believe me when I tell you that it is so much more important than being the dominator of this valley or that hill.&quot; He thinks most &quot;sane&quot; Israelis know this. What needs to happen next is that, somehow, they must close the gap between what they know and what they do. Not that he regards peace as a Hollywood ending. &quot;It will be difficult. If there is peace, there will have been heavy compromise and that means a lot of angry and vengeful fanatics on both sides. They will do anything they can to assassinate it. They will bomb themselves here and there. But the alternative is worse. If we have no peace, the circles of bloodshed will become even more violent and hateful.&quot; We have been talking for almost two hours. Grossman has a wedding to get to and there is the traffic to consider and... he shows me his palms, apologetically. &quot;I&apos;ve talked too much,&quot; he says. I disagree. There is something powerfully sustaining in listening to him talk: it means he is still with us. He nods. &quot;I would not have chosen this catastrophe,&quot; he says. &quot;But since it happened, I want to explore it. I feel I was thrown into no-man&apos;s-land and the only way to allow my life to coexist with death is to write about it. When I write about it, I&apos;m not a victim. It is strange and unexpected to discover this. The great temptation is not to expose yourself to these atrocities. But if you do that, you&apos;ve lost the war. The language of war is narrow and functional. Writing is the opposite. You describe your reality in the highest resolution even when it&apos;s a nightmare and in doing so, you live your own life, not a cliche others have formulated for you.&quot; On that terrible night in 2006, he told himself, as he walked from the bedroom to the front door, that life was about to end. &quot;That&apos;s what I felt at that moment. But I was wrong. Life is different, but it&apos;s not over.&quot; David Grossman will talk about his new novel on Thursday at the Friends House, Euston Road, London NW1, at 7pm.

Using characteristic street language, Putin derided Russia&apos;s opposition as a group of publicity-seeking malcontents and said they had only themselves to blame if they were on the receiving end of police brutality during anti-government meetings. Putin&apos;s scathing remarks in an interview with the Kommersant newspaper come before protests inside Russia tomorrow as well as demonstrations against the Russian government in several cities internationally. Anti-Putin rallies are due to take place for the first time outside the Russian consulate in Kensington Palace Gardens in London, and in New York, Helsinki, Berlin and Tel Aviv. For the past eight months Russia&apos;s small but vociferous opposition has held rallies in Moscow and St Petersburg on the 31st of each month. Organisers say they will go ahead with a planned rally in central Moscow&apos;s Triumfalnaya square tomorrow, despite the likelihood of arrest by riot police who have violently broken up previous gatherings. Speaking while driving a Lada on a road trip over the weekend in Russia&apos;s far east, Putin said Russians needed to get permission before they could take to the streets. He explained: &quot;You&apos;ve got it? Go and march. If not, you don&apos;t have the right. Go to a rally without permission and you get a whack on the bonce. It&apos;s that simple.&quot; Putin said the demonstrators invited the western media along and &quot;poured red paint on their heads&quot; to give the Kremlin a bad name. He said that in London demonstrators who protested without permission also got a &quot;whack on the nut&quot;. Putin made his comments to Andrey Kolesnikov, Kommersant&apos;s special correspondent and Russia&apos;s best-known print journalist, who travelled with the prime minister along a new federal highway between Khabarovsk and Chita. At one point Putin \u2013 Russia&apos;s president for eight years and prime minister for the past two \u2013 was forced to stop after stones got stuck in the wheels of his sporting Lada Kalina, Kolesnikov recorded. Writing on his blog today the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov said the interview revealed Putin to be &quot;mendacious, ignorant and spiteful&quot;. He poured scorn on Putin&apos;s claim in it that he had never heard of the liberal rock star Yuri Shevchuk, who has led recent rallies strumming his guitar. &quot;It&apos;s like David Cameron claiming he&apos;s never heard of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones,&quot; Nemtsov suggested. Moscow&apos;s city government has consistently refused to grant permission for opposition rallies, and last week fenced off Triumfalnaya square ahead of tomorrow&apos;s protest. Asked why the government seemed bent on thwarting the rallies at all cost, Putin said: &quot;Believe me, I don&apos;t know about this. This isn&apos;t my affair.&quot; Elsewhere, Putin hinted he intends to continue to play a major role in Russian politics amid speculation he is plotting to return to the Kremlin as president during elections in 2012. He refused to say whether he or the current president, Dmitry Medvedev, would run for office, but told Kolesnikov he would not watch passively if he felt his legacy to the Russian state was under threat. Asked whether he had made mistakes over the past decade, Putin said he could not think of any. Putin also cast doubt on the apparent reset in relations between Washington and Moscow. He praised the US president, Barack Obama, as &quot;sincere&quot; but claimed the Americans continued to arm Georgia \u2013 the Kremlin&apos;s least favourite neighbour following the brief 2008 Russo-Georgia war \u2013 and had not yet abandoned plans to install a missile defence system in Europe. Several high-profile Russian exiles are due to take part in tomorrow&apos;s unprecedented pro-opposition picket outside the Russian embassy in London. They include associates of Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian spy murdered in 2006, as well as the Cambridge-based Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky and the fugitive telecoms entrepreneur Yevgeny Chichvarkin. Chichvarkin fled to the UK in 2008 after falling foul of the Kremlin. The &quot;Strategy-31&quot; protests are named after paragraph 31 of Russia&apos;s constitution, which is supposed to guarantee freedom of assembly.

On the 31st of the month, a group of noisy protesters gather in downtown Moscow&apos;s Triumfalnaya Square. They shout slogans against Vladimir Putin and his regime. The 31ers, as they are known, are seeking to defend Russia&apos;s much-abused constitution and in particular article 31 \u2013 meant to guarantee freedom of assembly. Over this year Moscow&apos;s city government has devised various tactics to stop these rallies from taking place, ranging from the brutal to the surreal \u2013 the campaign is beginning to look like a convoluted game of chess for control of the square. The authorities have turned down all applications to stage the &quot;Strategy-31&quot; gatherings. And in time-honoured Russian fashion, mayor Yuri Luzhkov has sent in the goons, with riot police deployed on every occasion to arrest protesters and chuck them in the back of police vans. In May police broke a journalist&apos;s arm; in July officials came up with a rival event in the square \u2013 a car rally. Ahead of the latest 31 gathering, these tactics have reached a new level of ridiculousness. The government last week announced it was building an underground car park underneath the square and fenced off the whole area. On Friday, two workmen could be seen slowly digging a small hole next to a statue of Russian futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. It is clear that nobody is in any hurry to get the work completed, which could now drag on for years. In retaliation, the 31ers have decided to take their protest global \u2013 with the first demonstration taking place today outside the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens, London and in New York, Helsinki, Berlin and Tel Aviv. &quot;We Russians living abroad cannot stand by quietly and watch as Russia gradually turns into a police state,&quot; Andrey Sidelnikov, organiser of the London picket, says. He adds: &quot;In recent years, in Russia the government has consistently refused to citizens of Russia their legitimate right to assemble freely.&quot; In the eight months since the rallies started, protesters have included elderly dissidents who fought against the Soviet Union and teenagers who were born in the 1990s, well after the collapse of communism. The protests rarely attract more than a few hundred people \u2013 although the rally in May drew a crowd of 2,000, which was violently broken up by police. At some point, one hopes, Russia&apos;s authoritarian-minded leadership will have to come up with a creative response to Russia&apos;s vigorous social protest movement.

Then the Palestinian youngsters marched in front of us and I thought to myself, this is where they sing about being martyrs and dying glorious deaths. A gentle breeze swayed the mulberry tree. On the far ridges of the mountains around Nablus, the lights of the illegal Israeli settlements twinkled. This village, I knew, had seen 2,000 acres of olive groves taken by those settlers, plus several lives. An older girl called the group to order then, in English, they launched into their chant. &quot;I&apos;m a red tomato, you&apos;re a green tomato. You&apos;re a little cucumber...&quot; Everyone started to laugh. A walking holiday in Palestine. You&apos;ve got to laugh really. I laughed a lot on that walk. And this in a part of the world where something horrible is always happening, be it shootings in Hebron, attacks on aid flotillas, or separation walls and rocket attacks. In the middle of such madness, laughter is the most unexpected and valuable pleasure, one that people seize at every opportunity.     Map of Palestine Photograph: Graphic    It was perhaps appropriate that I started my hike in the far north of the West Bank, within a few miles of a hill called Megiddo, where Pharoah Thutmose III overwhelmed the Canaanite king Durusha in about 1457BC, thus beginning the legend of Armageddon, the site of the Last Battle. With my guide Hejazi, I walked through peaceful fields of wheat past other ancient sites, exploring Roman tombs lost in undergrowth and watching storks circling overhead on their migration north. Our first major stopping point was Jenin, a town whose name is tied inextricably to violence and death. Despite its reputation, however, Jenin turned out to be a friendly market town of Palestinian farmers, a place to gorge on strawberries and almonds, washed down with carob juice sold from huge ornamental brass urns. I walked around the souk in a bit of a daze. How could reality be so different from expectations? Certainly, the walls were pockmarked with bullet holes from the second intifada, but the martyrdom posters were all faded by the sunshine and people wanted to shake hands. The carob-juice seller adjusted his Ray-Bans and grinned: &quot;Why not join me on Facebook?&quot; There are several long distance footpaths in Palestine, but the one I was following was the Masar Ibrahim al-Khalil \u2013 literally Path of Abraham the Friend of God, simply the Masar for short. This new route stretches across the Middle East, starting at Abraham&apos;s birthplace in Sanliurfa, south-east Turkey, and winds south through Syria, Jordan and Israel. Eventually, it could stretch all the way to Mecca, linking existing paths associated with Abraham, and new routes. Its purpose is to promote understanding between different faiths and cultures; it&apos;s also intended &quot;as a catalyst for sustainable tourism and economic development&quot;. In places the path barely exists yet, in others it is well-worn, but everywhere it needs a guide. Hejazi was my man in Palestine, a person of unending cheerfulness and optimism. For a Muslim, Hejazi tells me, the idea of a path named after Abraham is attractive since the great patriarch is revered as the &quot;father of hospitality&quot;. To Jews and Christians, he is equally important \u2013 the starting point for monotheistic worship. The Masar, I discovered, is not some do-gooder peace initiative, but simply a great way to see the landscape and meet people. The path makes no attempt to follow Abraham&apos;s original route, even if such a path could be discovered; rather it links sites that bear legends and folk tales about the man. Our first major site was south of Jenin at Jebel Gerazim, a mountain that stands above the ancient town of Nablus and affords astonishing views west to the Mediterranean and east to the hills of Jordan. On the summit of the mountain is a tower built by Saladin and some fine, if neglected, Byzantine mosaics guarded by a group of Israeli teenage soldiers. Further down the hillside, we could see the houses of that renowned Jewish sect the Samaritans, a group that still has more than 700 followers. &quot;The reason the Samaritans revere this place,&quot; Hejazi explained, &quot;is because they believe Abraham came here and built his first altar in Canaan.&quot; It was a well-chosen spot to view what Abraham wanted: territory. &quot;Unto thy seed,&quot; said his God, &quot;will I give this land.&quot; And that was very generous of the Lord, all things considered. Except, of course, that all things had not been considered: previous inhabitants and the sheer fertility of Abraham&apos;s seed, which includes not only the 12 tribes of Israel but the prophet Muhammad via Ishmael, fruit of Abraham&apos;s union with the serving wench Hagar. And what about all those cousins from Noah&apos;s brothers? If Abe&apos;s God had spent a few moments considering, he might have foreseen problems. That evening we stayed in Awata, a village near Nablus where the children sang about red tomatoes. There were tales of horror and violence too \u2013 there is no escaping the bloodied history in this land \u2013 but it never became overwhelming, as I&apos;d expected. Hassan, our host, was keen to enthuse about the Masar: &quot;It was like a light coming on here,&quot; he said. &quot;We got connected to the outside world and that makes us feel hope. Everyone in the village is always asking about when the next walkers are coming.&quot; Like most Palestinian villages, Awata has long since burst out of its ancient walled settlement and sprawled along the hill. But what is fascinating is that, amid the concrete and graffiti, there are sudden glimpses of an ancient world. When we chatted about water resources, Hassan jumped up and hauled open a trapdoor under our feet. Below us was a vast echoing cavern. &quot;It&apos;s a Roman water tank,&quot; he explained. &quot;We&apos;ve got three of them.&quot; After a huge feast of chicken, freshly made bread, pickles, salads and yoghurt, Hejazi and I bedded down on mattresses in the living room and slept. Next morning we started out at 8am, meandering through olive groves and wheat fields. Scents of Persian thyme, wild sage and oregano drifted up from beneath our tramping feet. We stopped at a spring to drink delicious clear water, then pressed on, meeting other walkers as we climbed through meadows of scarlet poppies and butterflies to Jabal Aurma, a bronze age fortress. One of the shocks of doing this path is that the countryside is lovely. Travellers have been returning from the Holy Land with scornful appraisals of its beauty for many centuries. Herman Melville is typically bleak: &quot;Bleached-leprosy-encrustations of curses-old cheese-bones of rocks,&quot; he wrote. The image of an ill-fated land has proven hard to budge. On top of Jabal Aurma we discovered six vast underground storage rooms carved from solid rock, presumably to supply the fort during prolonged sieges. There is never any doubt in Palestine that this land has been a chaotic crossroads for civilisations, armies and tribes for a very long time \u2013 that is what makes it fascinating and worth exploring. Later that day, we emerged on the edge of a grand escarpment looking down to the Jordan Valley, around 800ft below sea level. The wheat fields around us were tiny rocky terraces splashed with the yellow of wild dill. It&apos;s a difficult place to farm, and we came across Shakir Murshid with his wife and six children busily harvesting wheat by hand. On a sage bush nearby was the complete shed skin of a viper. That night we stayed in Douma, a cluster of old stone dwellings long since overgrown by the straggling concrete of modernity. Rural life, however, was pretty much the same as ever: woodpeckers tapped at the trees, wheat fields surrounded the houses and men rode past on donkeys. We spent the evening by a campfire listening to locals sing and play homemade flutes. The patch of flat ground where we had built our fire turned out to be a Roman wine press, empty sadly. Once again we slept in someone&apos;s living room, under the eyes of family martyrs. Our third day took us further south near the springs of Ain Samiya, now a water source for Jerusalem. We spotted chameleons in the bushes, whistling rock hyraxes and huge flightless crickets, then clambered up a delightful gorge, taking narrow shepherds&apos; trails along the cliff face. By evening we approached the village of Kufer Malik, a place that was to hold perhaps the biggest surprises. The first came at a huge hacienda-style house, where the whole family came out to invite us in for coffee. &quot;Do you speak Spanish?&quot; asked the husband. &quot;I learned it in Columbia.&quot; Kufer Malik, bizarrely, is a little enclave of Latin America in Palestine. When we found our hosts for the night, the old man of the family, Hosni al-Qaq, explained: &quot;In the 30s when times were hard here, my uncle decided to seek his fortune in America. He ended up selling shirts in Columbia, then got a shop and then a supermarket. He became very rich.&quot; Hosni smiled ruefully. &quot;My father on the other hand stayed behind and was killed in the first intifada.&quot; &quot;And did other men go?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, lots and lots, and then they spread out into other countries. There are now more than 800 descendants of this village in Brazil alone.&quot; The effect of this exposure to the outside world on Kufer Malik has been electrifying. The men are hard-working and ambitious; the women assertive and independent-minded. Hiba, our hostess, had been to the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur to see what it was like. &quot;We camped on the beach in Nice,&quot; she said proudly. &quot;It was lovely.&quot; So was her cooking: roast chicken, rice, vegetables and musahn, a flat bread cooked with sumac and onions. &quot;What would you do if a Jewish person came to stay?&quot; I asked. &quot;No problem,&quot; they all said eagerly. &quot;We&apos;ve had one Jewish lady from America already and another from Brazil. Everyone is welcome here.&quot; After dinner, the men sat out in the yard smoking shisha pipes. When they spoke Spanish, they looked like pure Columbians to me: all macho body language and grand gestures. When they spoke Arabic, they were Palestinian farmers again. Our fourth day took us to Abu Taybah, home to the West Bank&apos;s only brewery \u2013 owned and run by a Palestinian Christian family (there are around 55,000 Palestinian Christians). After a glass of deliciously cold lager we moved on, walking down Wadi Qult to the marvellous fourth-century cliff-side monastery of St George, then on to Jericho. The end of the Masar comes in Hebron, whose old city has been a dangerous flashpoint over the years. Zionist settlers have seized buildings in the market area \u2013 which has to be roofed with netting now to prevent rocks and rubbish raining down on shoppers. All of Abraham&apos;s progeny want a piece of the action here and the mosque has been forcibly divided to create a Muslim and a Jewish section. On one side, I found Indian Muslims praying and taking photos; on the other Jews from New York and Tel Aviv were doing the same. The Tomb of the Patriarchs, of course, looks pretty similar from either angle, though neither community, sadly, ever gets to see that fact. Out in the street a shopkeeper invited me to have coffee. He was sitting with Micha, a former Israeli soldier turned peace activist, a young freckle-faced man with a friendly smile. What had convinced him to adopt what many Israelis see as a traitorous approach? &quot;Small things. It started when I was a soldier, talking at checkpoints to Palestinians, seeing what the settlers were doing, and what we were doing to protect them.&quot; At that moment a Palestinian lady came over. They introduced themselves. &quot;So now you work for peace?&quot; she asked. &quot;But I have to ask: did you kill any Palestinians?&quot; Around the shopfront where people were taking coffee and chatting, everyone froze. There was a long silence while Micha considered his reply. &quot;I&apos;d rather not say.&quot; &quot;I think you should,&quot; the woman said. &quot;For any reconciliation, you have to.&quot; A murmur of agreement passed through the small crowd. Micha thought again. &quot;The truth is, I don&apos;t know. At Abu Sinaina we did shoot, but it was from far away.&quot; &quot;At Abu Sinaina? Then you killed at least five.&quot; There was a pause and then Micha nodded. The Palestinian lady smiled. &quot;You are welcome at my house. You must come for lunch.&quot; They exchanged addresses and Micha promised that he would visit. What is remarkable about the Masar walk is that religion and politics mostly take a back seat, allowing ordinary people to climb out of the foxholes of prejudice and suspicion. When that happens, Palestine becomes so much more than a brief and violent television news clip. I saw gazelles running on hillsides, tasted the local cuisine and enjoyed conversation on everyday topics. I climbed down inside bronze age burial chambers, tracked hyenas into their lairs inside Roman tombs and lay on the benches in Nablus&apos;s marvellous Turkish baths, discussing the best way to pickle olives. The problems of Israel&apos;s land-grabbing tactics remain: the wall is still standing and unsmiling teenage soldiers at checkpoints demand to see passports. The Masar is not for those who want private rooms or special treatment. It is intense and sometimes emotionally draining. There were moments when I felt rage about the injuries and injustices. But, more than anything, this was a life-affirming and exhilarating experience that will stay with me like few others.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-03T23:04:00Z", "title": "Walking in Palestine", "sentences": ["On one side, I found Indian Muslims praying and taking photos; on the other Jews from New York and Tel Aviv were doing the same."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/04/palestine-walking-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Fresh details have emerged in the case of a Palestinian man an Israeli court convicted of &quot;rape by deception&quot; after he was accused of posing as a Jewish man in order to have sex with a Jewish-Israeli woman. The case caused international outrage when it was first reported, in July, but now an Israeli newspaper has reported that the conviction was the result of a plea bargain over a violent rape. Ha&apos;ir, a Tel Aviv weekly and part of the newspaper group that owns Haaretz, published extracts from the victim&apos;s unsealed testimony. It also reported that the prosecution had agreed to the reduced charge of &quot;rape by deception&quot; because of the victim&apos;s confused account and concern at facing another court appearance. Saber Kushour, from East Jerusalem, said he had had consensual sex with the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, within minutes of meeting her on a West Jerusalem street. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after the Jerusalem district court ruled he was guilty of rape by deception. One of the judges said that, although the sex had been consensual, the woman involved &quot;would not have consented if she had not believed Kushour was Jewish&quot;. It was reported at the time that Kashur had been charged with rape and indecent assault but that those charges were reduced after a plea bargain arrangement. This week, Ha&apos;ir reported that, according to her testimony, the woman had met Kashur on a street in West Jerusalem and chatted with him for a few minutes before he invited her into a nearby building, claiming it was his workplace. Asked why she had agreed, she reportedly told the court: &quot;I looked for someone to put my trust in.&quot; Once inside the building, the woman says she was raped and then left naked and bleeding. Part of her testimony reads: &quot;He said that if I don&apos;t stay silent and I don&apos;t resist, then it would like end faster and it wouldn&apos;t be like ... he wouldn&apos;t use force. I still resisted him, and it was forced.&quot; The newspaper describes a women in her late 20s who had been abused by her father from an early age and forced by him to become a sex worker. She was living at a women&apos;s shelter when the incident occurred, and was subsequently taken to a psychiatric hospital with a section for female victims of sexual crimes. The prosecution, it is claimed, agreed to the plea bargain that reduced the charge to rape by deception in order to prevent a long cross-examination of a traumatised victim. Ha&apos;ir also reports that the woman had filed 14 previous complaints, mostly for sexual offences, some of which did not result in convictions owing to lack of evidence or because of questions around the veracity of the complaint. The prosecution was concerned that Kashur&apos;s legal team would question the women over all these cases in court. [Thursday 9 September: Since this article was published, Kushour has responded, saying the fact that he had been released from house arrest (pending an appeal) backed his version of events. He adds: &quot;I have no prior convictions \u2013 this is the first time, while she has a long history of rape charges. She still claims I raped her \u2013 but even the prosecution, which is supposed to represent her, does not believe her.&quot;] Describing the reduced charge, deputy prosecutor Danny Wittman told Ha&apos;ir: &quot;Plea bargains never match the original narrative of the plaintiff, because the two sides have to bridge the gap between them and reach an agreement. In this case, we gave up on the &apos;forcible&apos; element and agreed to a rewriting of the indictment, according to which the defendant had sex with the woman with her consent ... obtained with deception.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 9 September to include a response from Saber Kushour", "publicationDate": "2010-09-08T17:09:49Z", "title": "Arab rape-by-deception charge 'was result of plea bargain'", "sentences": ["Ha&apos;ir, a Tel Aviv weekly and part of the newspaper group that owns Haaretz, published extracts from the victim&apos;s unsealed testimony."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/08/rape-by-deception-plea-israel"}, {"tags": ["Jazz", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Tel Aviv pianist Anat Fort made her debut for ECM six years ago, with no less a drummer than Paul Motian in the band.

The sale, under negotiation since 2007, is aimed mainly at bolstering Saudi defences against Iran, which the US suspects will achieve a nuclear weapons capability within the next few years. The transfer of advanced technology, mainly planes, is to provide Saudi Arabia with air superiority over Iran. The Obama administration is due to send the deal to Congress in the next fortnight. The Senate and House then have 30 days to amend, cancel or approve the deal. If approved, the Obama administration can then take the final steps towards completing the deal. Members of Congress have been notoriously difficult in regard to arms deals with Saudi Arabia over the last three decades, partly because of lobbying by Israel in the 1980s and 90s and partly as a reaction to the 9/11 attacks orchestrated by the Saudi-born al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden. They have also raised concerns over the lack of human rights and freedom for women in Saudi Arabia. Congress has amended and even blocked arms deals with the Saudis in the past. But Washington-based analysts say such concerns will be overridden because of the greater worries about Iran. A US defence official told Reuters today that the US and Saudi Arabia are discussing a package that includes 84 new F-15 fighter jets, upgrading another 70 of them as well as buying 72 Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corporation. The two sides are also discussing a package for the kingdom&apos;s navy. The Saudis have agreed to an initial $30bn in sales, with another $30bn still under discussion. The initial figure to be sent to Congress for review may be $30bn for approval this year. The deal rivals the al-Yamamah deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia signed in the mid-1980s, one of the biggest in history, worth $66bn in revenue for BAE. Michael Knights, the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who has written in detail about the deal, predicted today a relatively smooth ride from Congress: &quot;The deal has a much better chance of being approved with limited or no modifications. First, the preparation for the package has been extensive and prolonged, stretching back to 2007. This has ironed out many potential problems, including significant consultations with the Israelis. &quot;Second, concern about a nuclear Iran is at an all-time high in Washington, Tel Aviv and Riyadh. Third, much has changed in the defence market since the last major Congressional campaign to block or downgrade a major Saudi arms deal, the 1993 Saudi purchase of F-15s aircraft. Since then, US manufacturers have had to up their game to compete with top-tier European technologies that are provided without limitations.&quot; To help ease passage through Congress, Obama is to put the emphasis on jobs, an important consideration at a time of high unemployment in the US. Members of Congress will not want to be seen endangering jobs, especially in the run-up to November&apos;s mid-term Congressional elections. The White House will stress that an estimated 75,000 jobs in companies such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and General Electric will be protected if the deal goes through. Some of the weapons systems, in particular upgraded weapons systems, are specifically related to the threat posed by Iran. Details have been leaking out in the US media over the last few months, prompting angry denunciations from Tehran. Israel, an even closer ally of the US than Saudi Arabia, has also expressed concerned over the transfer of advanced technology to Saudi Arabia. Addressing Israeli concerns, advanced sensors on the new Saudi F-15s will have technology built in to prevent them being used against their Israeli equivalents. While Israel sees Saudi Arabia as a useful buttress against Iran, there is a fear in Tel Aviv that a rogue Saudi pilot might opt for a suicide mission against Israel. The Israeli air force want to maintain an advantage. Knights said: &quot;Iran is certainly the only advanced state that Saudi Arabia needs to fear as a credible armed opponent in the next decade. Certain weapon systems like upgraded missile defences are explicitly concerned with Iran. The advanced sensors in the new Saudi F-15s will have fail-safes to prevent their effective use against US aircraft such as the types used by Israel.&quot; The Pentagon neither confirmed nor denied today that a deal is in the offing. A defence department spokesman restated the formal position: &quot;We have not concluded arms sales agreements with Saudi Arabia, and we have not notified Congress of pending sales. The US does partner with multiple countries in the Middle East in our multifaceted approach to regional security and stability. This involves a wide range of activities from training and exercises to military sales.&quot; Congress has a history of being difficult about Saudi Arabia, passing legislation in 1986 to block sales of missiles and missile launchers approved by President Ronald Reagan. The deal finally went through only after Reagan was forced to withdraw Stinger missiles from the package. In 1990, the administration of George H Bush planned to send Saudi Arabia $20bn in arms but opposition from Congress saw this cut down to $7bn.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-13T20:29:29Z", "title": "US prepares to approve $60bn arms deal with Saudi Arabia", "sentences": ["&quot;Second, concern about a nuclear Iran is at an all-time high in Washington, Tel Aviv and Riyadh.", "While Israel sees Saudi Arabia as a useful buttress against Iran, there is a fear in Tel Aviv that a rogue Saudi pilot might opt for a suicide mission against Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/us-arms-deal-saudi-arabia"}, {"tags": ["Manchester City", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "After all the transfer business, with six new players driving through the gates at a total of \u00a3126m, there was an incongruity about Manchester City arriving in Austria for their opening Europa League group game with only two strikers available and the manager, Roberto Mancini, bemoaning his lack of resources. Injuries to Emmanuel Adebayor and Mario Balotelli mean Mancini will have only Carlos Tevez and the much maligned J\u00f4 in terms of recognised forwards for the tie against Red Bull Salzburg in the Wals-Siezenheim stadium. The City manager spoke about it being a &quot;big problem&quot;, one that has been exacerbated by his decision to exclude Roque Santa Cruz from his official 25-man squad in favour of the academy graduate Shaleum Logan. &quot;When we made that decision we could never have known that we lose two strikers in one week,&quot; Mancini said when asked whether, in hindsight, Santa Cruz&apos;s omission might have been a mistake. &quot;We had to include four homegrown players on the list and that meant someone had to miss out. Unfortunately that means we now have only Carlos and J\u00f4 and that is a problem for us.&quot; After two fitful years J\u00f4 probably now has the ignominious honour of being the player the City supporters dislike the most but Mancini remains supportive. &quot;I think J\u00f4 is a good player,&quot; he said. &quot;He has a good attitude and good technique and he is an important player for us now.&quot; Joleon Lescott has also missed the trip after a groin injury that could rule him out for two weeks but Wayne Bridge is fit again and will make his first appearance of the season against a team that won their domestic league last season but were eliminated from the Champions League qualifiers by Hapoel Tel Aviv. Salzburg have since taken five points from their first five league games, leaving them third from bottom, They did, however, win all six group matches in this competition last year and Mancini has promised not to underestimate them despite feeling obliged to make several changes. One of those is expected be the reintroduction of David Silva, the \u00a325m signing from Valencia, to the starting line-up after an indifferent start to his City career. &quot;It&apos;s normal that when a player arrives in a new country he may have some problems for the first two months but I think after three, four or five games he will be back to normal,&quot; Mancini said. Silva&apos;s hopes of making a favourable early impression have not been helped by Spain&apos;s international commitments, with trips to Argentina and Mexico in the last few weeks. &quot;He has to fit into the Premier League and I think this game will be good for him because it is a different pace,&quot; the midfielder Nigel de Jong said. &quot;People have to have patience with him because what we see in training is someone who can do wonderful things.He has a gifted left foot and if we give him time he will be one of the stars.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-09-15T19:40:00Z", "title": "Manchester City's striking woes forces Roberto Mancini to turn to J\u00f4", "sentences": ["&quot;He has a good attitude and good technique and he is an important player for us now.&quot; Joleon Lescott has also missed the trip after a groin injury that could rule him out for two weeks but Wayne Bridge is fit again and will make his first appearance of the season against a team that won their domestic league last season but were eliminated from the Champions League qualifiers by Hapoel Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/15/manchester-city-roberto-mancini-jo"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Human rights", "Law", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The day starts early, at a petrol station alongside a roaring Jerusalem road. The mood among the 15 Israeli women is a little tense, but it&apos;s hardly surprising \u2013 they&apos;re about to break the law and with it one of the country&apos;s taboos. They plan to drive into the occupied West Bank, pick up Palestinian women and children and take them on a day trip to Tel Aviv. Today&apos;s is the second such trip \u2013 another group of women went public with a similar action last month. It is hoped that these will become regular outings, designed to create awareness of the laws that govern movement for Palestinians, and to challenge the fears that Israelis have about travelling into the West Bank. Riki is a 63-year-old from Tel Aviv who, like the other women did not want to give her surname. She said it took her time to sign up to the trips. &quot;I was resistant to breaking the law. But then I realised that civil action is the only way to go forward, that breaking an illegal law becomes legal.&quot; The women take off in a convoy of cars, through an Israeli checkpoint used by settlers and into several villages around Hebron. There are dozens of Palestinian women waiting for them and each Israeli driver is allocated passengers. As two young Palestinian women climb into the car, they remove hijabs, scarves and floor-length coats to reveal skinny jeans and long hair \u2013 a look that ensures they pass through the Israeli settler-only checkpoint without scrutiny. &quot;I am afraid of the soldiers,&quot; said 21-year-old Sara, nervously. But she and 19-year-old Sahar, visibly relax as the car breezes past the checkpoint. They pull CDs out of bags and are soon listening to loud Arabic dabke music as the car heads along a road that joins the main highway to Tel Aviv. &quot;It&apos;s like we are using the tools of the occupation,&quot; said Irit, one of the drivers. &quot;It just wouldn&apos;t occur to the soldiers at the checkpoints that Israeli women would want to do this.&quot; As Tel Aviv nears, the Palestinian passengers silently survey the tall buildings and outdoor cafes and seem especially taken with the ubiquitous motorcycles and mopeds that speed around the city. &quot;I would like to ride on one, like that,&quot; said Sara, pointing to a woman in shorts perched on the back of a bike. But all the Palestinian women have just one request: to go to the sea. For most, it&apos;s their first trip to the seaside, even though it is a short drive from home. The passengers join another carload and head to the promenade in Jaffa, the mixed Arab-Israeli city stuck to the tail-end of Tel Aviv, where the Palestinian women race to greet the waves crashing against the bright rocks. &quot;It is so much more beautiful than I thought,&quot; said Nawal, watching her gleeful seven-year-old daughter skipping backwards to avoid being sprayed by the waves. &quot;It is more beautiful than on TV, the colour is amazing.&quot; Fatima, 24, gazes out at the horizon. &quot;I didn&apos;t know that the sound of the sea is so relaxing,&quot; she said. Sara asks for a sheet of paper, speedily folds it into a paper boat and writes her name on it, intending to set it out to sea. &quot;So that it will remember me,&quot; she said. The group convenes at a Jaffa restaurant \u2013 about 45 of them in total, including seven children. They are a cheerful party stretched across two long tables. From afar they seem just like any other restaurant party, as the women chat about children, weight gain and health. But the excursion is far from ordinary. All Palestinians need permits to enter Israel and the penalties for not doing so can involve imprisonment. It is also against the law for Israelis to &quot;smuggle&quot; Palestinians without a permit across the Green Line. A few months ago Ilana Hammerman, an Israeli journalist, wrote an account of her day trip to Tel Aviv with West Bank Palestinians in Haaretz newspaper. That prompted a criminal investigation against her, for violating Israel&apos;s law of entry. But it also inspired a group of women to take the same trip and then take an advertisement in the newspaper to publicise the fact. Since then, there have been hundreds of signatories to a petition of support and many women, on both sides, ready to defy the law. That&apos;s one of the purposes of the action, said Esti, who has been on both trips. &quot;We want more Israelis to realise that there is nothing to be scared of. We want more people to refuse to accept the ideology that keeps us apart \u2013 and to just refuse to be enemies.&quot; Restrictions Before 1991, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza could move freely and restrictions on travel into Israel were the exception. Then Israel began a permit regime, whereby Palestinians cannot travel without a permit issued by Israel&apos;s civil administration, set up by military decree to operate in the West Bank. The permit system wasn&apos;t seriously imposed until the mid-90s, as response to a wave of terrorist attacks inside Israel. Since then, Israel has introduced increasingly restrictive criteria for obtaining a permit and constructed physical barriers \u2013 such as the separation wall \u2013 that have made enforcement of the system more effective. West Bank Palestinians granted permits include a quota of workers, who must be over 35 and married; medical patients; students, although under restrictive circumstances; and older persons for religious reasons, such as to pray or to visit family during religious holidays. Some traders and VIPs are also given permits to travel into Israel. Gisha, the legal centre for freedom of movement, estimates that around 1% of Palestinians are given permits to enter Israel. Some 24,000 Palestinian workers are permitted to enter Israel from the West Bank. From Gaza, entry for Palestinians to Israel is exceptional and mostly for medical or humanitarian cases.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-16T18:45:38Z", "title": "Sun, sea and grit: Israeli and West Bank women risk jail for day at the beach", "sentences": ["They plan to drive into the occupied West Bank, pick up Palestinian women and children and take them on a day trip to Tel Aviv.", "Riki is a 63-year-old from Tel Aviv who, like the other women did not want to give her surname.", "They pull CDs out of bags and are soon listening to loud Arabic dabke music as the car heads along a road that joins the main highway to Tel Aviv.", "&quot;It just wouldn&apos;t occur to the soldiers at the checkpoints that Israeli women would want to do this.&quot; As Tel Aviv nears, the Palestinian passengers silently survey the tall buildings and outdoor cafes and seem especially taken with the ubiquitous motorcycles and mopeds that speed around the city.", "The passengers join another carload and head to the promenade in Jaffa, the mixed Arab-Israeli city stuck to the tail-end of Tel Aviv, where the Palestinian women race to greet the waves crashing against the bright rocks.", "A few months ago Ilana Hammerman, an Israeli journalist, wrote an account of her day trip to Tel Aviv with West Bank Palestinians in Haaretz newspaper."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/16/palestinian-women-smuggled-israeli-beaches"}, {"tags": ["Premier League", "Sport", "Premier League 2010-11"], "article": "Dimitar Berbatov can play football So Dimitar Berbatov is good then. You call this news? He was, after all, the guy who scored this for Bulgaria, this for Tottenham and this for Bayer Leverkusen. Until this weekend you could argue that Manchester United had not seen him at his absolute finest, but in the lazy perfection with which he scored his first goal against Liverpool, the technical wizardry that brought his second and the classic centre-forward&apos;s leap&apos;n&apos;nod that completed the hat-trick they witnessed a genuinely terrific striking performance. The back pages are in agreement this morning: &quot;Head over heels!&quot; screams The Times over a picture of his overhead kick. &quot;Berbatov genius!&quot; shouts The Telegraph. &quot;Torres is a cheat!&quot; bellows the Sun, who appear not to have read the script. &quot;I am nothing special,&quot; a pleasingly humble Berbatov, joint top scorer this season alongside Florent Malouda, told MUTV. &quot;I&apos;m going home to play with my kids. Tomorrow is another day and next Sunday we have another game. That&apos;s it. It was probably one of my best games for United but I don&apos;t want it to be my last so I will keep working and hopefully I will improve on the things I try to do.&quot; His improvement has come at the perfect time, as without it Wayne Rooney&apos;s failure to exert the slightest influence on yesterday&apos;s game would surely have been making less positive headlines instead. Chelsea have enjoyed the longest pre-season in history So far Chelsea have played five domestic league games and racked up an aggregate scoreline of 21-1, conceding that one goal in the 85th minute of a match they were already winning 3-0. Their away games have been against the teams that ended last season 17th and 16th in the Premier League, while two of the visitors to Stamford Bridge have only just been promoted. The other was Stoke, who last won a league game at Chelsea in 1974 and shipped seven there last season. Chelsea are yet to play anyone who ended last season higher than 11th; every other top-flight side except for Aston Villa has already played one of last season&apos;s top seven. Chelsea cannot be blamed for their excellence, but their season so far has been so comfortable it has begun to reflect badly on the Premier League as a competition. But it&apos;s just as well that they had this period in which to play themselves into form, because their actual pre-season was pretty ropey, featuring an unconvincing 1-0 win over Crystal Palace followed by defeats to Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt, Hamburg, then Manchester United in the Community Shield. Their next league fixtures are against Manchester City and Arsenal. &quot;We know the next game in the league will be more difficult,&quot; admitted Carlo Ancelotti. &quot;We have not played against the top teams but we are playing well. It is necessary for us to do it against the top teams.&quot; Carlos Tevez really doesn&apos;t like Wigan Tevez&apos;s opener for Manchester City yesterday was his sixth goal in seven games against Wigan. Sure, nobody really enjoys playing against him right now \u2013 that&apos;s 24 goals in his last 28 league games \u2013 but the Latics seem to get singled out for particular punishment, and he got an assist for Yaya Tour\u00e9&apos;s second to boot. Though to be fair, if Wigan really wanted to stop him scoring they might try to cut out the kind of clear assist that Mohamed Diam\u00e9 provided, nodding on Joe Hart&apos;s clearance to let the Argentinian scamper clear. &quot;We can have more out of him,&quot; said Roberto Mancini. &quot;At this moment he probably isn&apos;t at 100% of his form.&quot; His new haircut has got to help \u2013 he is now 18% more aerodynamic than he was in his Ryan Sidebottom days, according to a statistic I just made up but might actually be true. Alan Hutton still exists Berbatov isn&apos;t the only player whose good form after signing for Tottenham was not sustained, but who has been thoroughly redeemed by a goalscoring appearance at the weekend. The other one, though, is still at Tottenham. While he has clearly suffered from injuries since his \u00a39m move from Rangers in 2008, I must admit to being a bit bemused by Hutton&apos;s collapse from grace at White Hart Lane. Here is a bright, threatening attacking full-back with the added bonus of physical height and power, but at the end of last season he was playing on loan at Sunderland while Harry Redknapp \u2013 to take one fairly disastrous visit to Old Trafford as an example \u2013 tried to shoehorn the likes of Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto and Wilson Palacios into the right-back spot. Now, though, Hutton is back. &quot;I want to see him push on; I want to see him have a great time here because he&apos;s capable of doing that,&quot; said Harry Redknapp after Hutton, a half-time substitute, won a penalty and scored in stoppage time as Spurs beat Wolves 3-1. &quot;I&apos;m not just saying this. There is a player there; there&apos;s a real player there. He&apos;s quick, he&apos;s aggressive, he&apos;s strong. He switches off defensively at times, that&apos;s what&apos;s cost him, but if he concentrates and wants to work on that side of his game, be can be top drawer. There&apos;s no doubt about that.&quot; Welcome back, Mr Hutton. Football has downgraded Yom Kippur There was a measure of surprise when Avram Grant decided to miss West Ham&apos;s match on Saturday to attend Synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. This is hardly the first time this particular festival has impacted on a sporting career \u2013 Eitan Friedlander and Shimshon Brockman would almost certainly have won a sailing medal at the 1988 Olympics rather than finishing fourth had they not skipped the race that fell on Yom Kippur \u2013 but it is interesting that nobody thought of the clash sooner. Towards the end of the 1960s, when the fixture list was compiled by Douglas Flower using a computer called KDF 9 (it filled an entire room), Arsenal \u2013 whose Jewish following is as strong as Tottenham&apos;s if a little less well-known \u2013 used to ask the Football League to avoid scheduling any matchon Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) or the key dates of Passover. In 1988, when Coventry City tried to reschedule a postponed fixture at Tottenham Hotspur for 20 September, the evening of Yom Kippur, Spurs simply refused. This year, they hosted Wolves without a whisper. Perhaps Ronny Rosenthal is responsible for the apparent downgrading of the festival, though his decision to play for Liverpool on Yom Kippur in 1992 \u2013 a 4-1 League Cup trouncing of Chesterfield \u2013 provoked something of a storm in his native Israel, which Grant would no doubt remember. Four years later Celta Vigo moved the kick-off of their La Liga game against Real Betis forward by an hour to give their midfielder Haim Revivo time to complete the match and get home before the festival started. When Bob Paisley brought the Israeli defender Avi Cohen to Liverpool from Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1979 he was apparently asked how observant the new signing was. &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; he asked. &quot;If he&apos;s orthodox he can&apos;t play on Saturdays,&quot; said the reporter. &quot;That&apos;s all right then,&quot; answered Paisley. &quot;I&apos;ve got 10 others like him.&quot; As it turned out Cohen could play on Saturdays, just not terribly well.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-20T13:43:59Z", "title": "Five things we learned from the Premier League this weekend | Simon Burnton", "sentences": ["When Bob Paisley brought the Israeli defender Avi Cohen to Liverpool from Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1979 he was apparently asked how observant the new signing was."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/sep/20/five-things-learned-premier-league"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel"], "article": "The housing project currently under construction\u00a0in Almon offers enticingly priced, spacious family homes with a garden and a view.\u00a0The surrounding neighbourhood, also known as Anatot, sits on a ridge overlooking the\u00a0Judean hills, near Jerusalem, a blaze of cultivated greenery in the parched landscape. Residents have a relaxed air, and newcomers who\u00a0have recently relocated from Jerusalem wish\u00a0they&apos;d made the move years ago. If I were a\u00a0prospective house-buyer, I&apos;d be charmed. But I\u00a0would not be looking here \u2013 because Almon is in\u00a0the occupied West Bank. It is a Jewish settlement with a population of around 1,000, established in the early 80s. Like all\u00a0Jewish settlements in the Palestinian West Bank, Almon is illegal according to international law. But its residents do not fit the headline-grabbing stereotypes of fanatical settlers, motivated by a\u00a0national-religious drive to claim land. There is a\u00a0marked paucity of Israeli flags and\u00a0no settler-slogan banners bedeck the streets. If the West Bank became part of an autonomous Palestinian state, residents of Almon would be unlikely to put up a fight, as the ideological settler movement has sworn to do. Instead, they would pack up and move back to Israel. The settlement movement began almost immediately after Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza, seized as the spoils of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Settlers were initially ideological but, by the 80s, the rightwing government that came to power realised that greater numbers of, perhaps less politically-motivated, Israelis would have to be enticed on to Palestinian land. Israel has always argued that settlements are a strategic and military asset. Former prime minister Ariel Sharon \u2013 one of the settler movement&apos;s biggest supporters \u2013 summed up Israel&apos;s approach in 1998 when he said of the occupied territories: &quot;Everyone there should move, should run, should grab more hills, expand more territory. Everything that&apos;s grabbed will be in our hands. Everything we don&apos;t grab will be in their hands.&quot; Yet in 2007, when the Israeli organisation Peace\u00a0Now polled settlers about their motivations for living where they do, 77% cited &quot;quality of life&quot;, suggesting that economic factors\u00a0and proximity to Israeli cities were primary considerations. That percentage can be\u00a0split into two camps: there is the rapidly expanding, low-income, ultra-Orthodox community, which, priced out of Jerusalem, has migrated to nearby settlements such as Modin Illit and Beitar Illit; then there are secular or mixed community settlements, such as Almon. These are often located close to the Green Line, the internationally recognised border between Israel and the Palestinian West Bank. And they exist primarily because the state wants them to. In Jerusalem \u2013 just as in the rest of Israel \u2013 decades of state planning has priced people out of\u00a0the city and into settlements in Palestinian East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Meanwhile, ideologically-motivated budgeting has resulted in\u00a0enticements and benefits for Israelis who live on occupied Palestinian land. Settlements, and the resources, infrastructure and military might\u00a0required to keep them going, are a major impediment to negotiations to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Under international pressure, for the past 10 months, Israel\u00a0has operated a partial freeze on settlement construction. However, the incentives still offered to\u00a0Israelis to live on Palestinian land are so considerable that, leaving politics aside, it would\u00a0be silly not to take advantage of them. To find out how easy it would be to buy a settlement home on Palestinian land in the midst\u00a0of this supposed freeze, I pose as an Israeli buyer, looking for a reasonably priced property for myself, my fictitious husband and the family we&apos;re planning. Walking into a Jerusalem estate agency with an imaginary spend of \u00a3200,000, a\u00a0realistic sum for an average Jerusalem couple, it\u00a0comes as no surprise when the agent says, &quot;With that sort of budget, you need to get beyond\u00a0the city.&quot; I&apos;ve already checked the housing market online and seen that the price for a home in West Jerusalem \u2013 four bedrooms across around 100 square metres \u2013 can start at around \u00a3400,000. Jerusalem&apos;s housing problem is blamed variously on its lack of high-rise housing (in part because many observant Jews do not use lifts on Saturdays); on environmentalists, who have prevented the city&apos;s expansion to the west (the only direction within Israel&apos;s borders); and on the &quot;ghost town&quot; effect in well-heeled parts of the city, where foreign Jewish buyers have snapped up second homes, pushing up the prices. The housing market is under such stress that, last year, Jerusalem&apos;s mayor wrote to absentee home-owners, asking them to rent out or sell up. The agent suggests Pisgat Ze&apos;ev or Neve Yaakov, both in East Jerusalem. Though these areas are defined as settlements by the international community, Israel views them as neighbourhoods of Jerusalem and has prioritised rapid Jewish development here, at the expense of affordable housing in West Jerusalem. However, at \u00a3250,000 for around 120 square metres, these houses might still be too pricey. I certainly can&apos;t afford a decent-sized property in the plusher Ramot or Gilo \u2013 also settlements, or\u00a0&quot;neighbourhoods&quot;, within Jerusalem&apos;s municipal boundaries. So the estate agent suggests Givat Ze&apos;ev, a secular settlement a 10-minute drive north-east of Jerusalem. The agent doesn&apos;t currently have homes to view there, but properties in this settlement \u2013 and many others \u2013 are advertised online under the category &quot;Jerusalem and surrounding area&quot;. A\u00a0quick call to each settlement&apos;s secretariat would provide me with agents&apos; phone numbers, and sometimes the numbers of private sellers, too. Givat Ze&apos;ev is a pretty settlement of 10,000 residents living in semi-detached homes on leafy,\u00a0winding streets. It is spacious and organised, with shops, schools and health services. Everything about its planning is designed to make you feel as\u00a0though you&apos;re in a\u00a0satellite of Jerusalem \u2013 there\u00a0are no demarcation lines, no checkpoints back into the city, and the Palestinian villages, if\u00a0visible, are behind a wall. Like so many settlements that hug the Green Line, Givat Ze&apos;ev is on the Israeli side of the separation barrier that cuts into the West Bank for\u00a0around 80% of its path. The barrier route runs,\u00a0in some places, up to 12 miles deep into the\u00a0West Bank, but settlements on the Israeli side\u00a0of it are, broadly speaking, &quot;consensus settlements&quot; \u2013 ones that Israelis assume will be conceded to the Jewish state in peace negotiations with the Palestinians. At Givat Ze&apos;ev there are plenty of large, affordable houses for sale, but the only new properties are on a recently-finished ultra-Orthodox project. I ask residents about new secular housing, but their response is, &quot;Don&apos;t you read the news?&quot; They&apos;re referring to the current 10-month freeze, but in August, Peace Now found that building on at least 600 settlement housing units had begun during that period, in more than 60 different settlements. Of those, it says, at least 492 were in direct violation of the freeze. My search for affordable, secular housing leads me, eventually, to Almon. It&apos;s a short drive east of\u00a0Jerusalem, and I&apos;ve had to cross an Israeli checkpoint, but it&apos;s specifically for settler use \u2013 a\u00a0nod, the &quot;right&quot; appearance and Israeli number plates get me waved through. Outside, a\u00a0billboard\u00a0advertises the number of the contractor, who confirms that 70 units are under construction at the site. The four-bedroom houses vary in size from 130 to 140 square metres, with gardens of up to 70 square metres, and they are shifting fast. The settlement is not officially exempt from the construction freeze, but Palestinian constructors are currently working on\u00a0the site and homes could be ready within a\u00a0year. The starting price is \u00a3175,150. It is staggeringly cheaper than an equivalent property on the Israeli side of the Green Line, because it is on Palestinian land, confiscated by\u00a0Israel. There are no market forces to dictate land\u00a0value here, as there would be in Tel Aviv or\u00a0West Jerusalem. Instead, the Israeli housing ministry regulates prices, keeping them low to\u00a0attract settlement. Campaigners say the contractor will also have received considerable state subsidies for connecting new settlement buildings to water and electricity mains \u2013 another\u00a0saving that&apos;s passed on to me, the buyer. Calculating my hypothetical mortgage allowance gives me yet more incentive to live across the Green Line. All Israelis qualify for a state allowance, an add-on to the mortgage lent by the bank, but with more favourable repayment terms. Points are added to your basic state allowance if you have children, have served in the army, or if you are a new Jewish migrant. Then there is a\u00a0top-up if you live in areas defined as &quot;national priority zones&quot;, which include some under-populated parts of Israel and all settlements. For a new property in Almon, I&apos;d get almost \u00a311,600 as a special allowance. But the allowances rise sharply for Israeli couples who pick homes in the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Betar Illit, near Jerusalem, or in Ariel, around 25km east\u00a0of the Green Line, or in Kiryat Arba, a hardline settlement near Hebron. For\u00a0each of those, I&apos;d get a total allowance of around \u00a340,200. When I ask, the housing ministry says\u00a0that state subsidies vary according to the &quot;security threat assessments&quot; pertinent to each area, adding that properties on the Israeli border with Lebanon qualify for similar amounts. Israeli settlements expert Dror Etkes describes how, at times, mortgages given in the West Bank have &quot;included loans which, after a period of time, turned into grants&quot;. The Israeli human rights group B&apos;Tselem reports that, between 1997\u00a0and 2002, the state put 419m shekels (around \u00a372m) into state-subsidised &quot;association mortgages&quot; for 1,800 apartments, most of them in the West Bank. The state comptroller, investigating these payments, found they were not included in the housing ministry&apos;s budget. Responding to queries over this funding, the ministry said it was not intended for &quot;the entire public&quot; and that announcing it would have caused &quot;unnecessary confusion&quot;. The veteran Israeli journalist and author Danny\u00a0Rubinstein remembers a time in the late 80s when contractors offered free cars to those who bought settlement homes. Meir Margalit, a\u00a0Jerusalem council member for the leftwing Meretz party, claims that at around the same time, Israelis invested in settlement property, left\u00a0uninhabited, in the knowledge that at some point the state would offer compensation to evacuate it. He says the practice was &quot;an open secret among settlers&quot;. Today, on top of my mortgage incentive, I&apos;d\u00a0get\u00a0free nursery care for my children from the\u00a0age of three, instead of five, as I would in Israel. Settlement schools are better funded, health services are allocated more state funds. I&apos;d\u00a0no longer get a\u00a07% discount on income tax \u2013 that incentive was scrapped in 2003; I&apos;d pay lower\u00a0local taxes, but my local council would be\u00a0twice as flush as those inside Israel, because of\u00a0a\u00a0central government funding bias. In 2006, the\u00a0Adva Centre, an Israeli policy analysis organisation, found settlers pay 60% of the national average in local tax. There are currently more than 200 settlements,\u00a0including West Bank outposts and neighbourhoods in annexed East Jerusalem, and\u00a0half a million Israelis live on the Palestinian side of the Green Line. B&apos;Tselem says it is impossible to calculate the\u00a0total state spend in settlement benefits, because &quot;government ministries obscure documentation of the moneys\u00a0in their budgets that are directed to the\u00a0settlements&quot;. But\u00a0Peace Now estimates that\u00a0settlements cost Israel $556m\u00a0(around \u00a3355m) a year \u2013 and it is clear that this cost is keenly felt by\u00a0those living within Israel, since the\u00a0state seems to prioritise settlements at their\u00a0expense. Responding to international pressure, in 2008 the Israeli government debated a plan to offer settlers cash to leave the West Bank, a move designed to target economic settlers rather than\u00a0ideological ones. The proposal \u2013 backed by then prime minister Ehud Olmert \u2013 couldn&apos;t get\u00a0through government. Yet there are currently thought to be lists of settlers who have expressed interest in leaving the West Bank, if compensated. For as long as Israel has occupied Palestinian lands, there has been a dominant force within government that has kept the settlements project going. Driven by a mix of national-religious conviction, expansionist politics and military tactics, the settlements project has wholly controlled state agenda. B&apos;Tselem describes the project as one of Israel&apos;s main national enterprises. State efforts to pull Israelis over the Green Line have been so forceful that, as Rubinstein puts it, &quot;You could say it was a bribe on a national scale.&quot; Israel has always played up the pain of dismantling the settlements. Yet as Israeli journalist Akiva Eldar writes in Lords Of The Land: The War For Israel&apos;s Settlements In The Occupied Territories, the &quot;elixir of life&quot; for these settlements is their infrastructure: the electricity, water pipes and military forces that guard them. Remove these, &quot;and this project collapses like a house of cards&quot;. Today, Eldar describes Israel&apos;s purported inability to do so as &quot;a myth perpetrated by the government to make us believe that it is impossible&quot;. How hard would it really be to divert funds from the occupied West Bank back into Israel, thus encouraging settlers to move back \u2013 especially from somewhere like Almon, where residents have already said they will relocate if\u00a0political realities dictate that they should? One man who has lived there for 20 years says\u00a0of the settlement, &quot;It is not fanatic in a\u00a0religious sense and not fanatic politically, either.&quot; Other residents agree. &quot;We came here because we were looking for a nice, peaceful place\u00a0near Jerusalem,&quot; says one woman, who still\u00a0votes for the Israeli Labour party. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to annoy anyone, and we are not ideological\u2026 The settler movement does not represent us.&quot; The problem, as Rubinstein points out, is that\u00a0what starts off as economics can eventually become ideological. &quot;When you move [to the settlements],&quot; he says, &quot;you can&apos;t say, &apos;Well, I\u00a0went there because I&apos;m greedy.&apos; You change your political opinion.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T23:03:12Z", "title": "'We were looking for a nice, peaceful place near Jerusalem'", "sentences": ["There are no market forces to dictate land\u00a0value here, as there would be in Tel Aviv or\u00a0West Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/25/west-bank-settlers"}, {"tags": ["Social history", "Russia", "Europe"], "article": "Moshe Lewin, who has died aged 88, was one of the foremost scholars of Soviet history. Misha Levin, as he was more familiarly known, was a vibrant and creative intellectual whose work, expressed in a language and style distinctively his own, and informed by his life experiences, made a major contribution to the field of social history. His magisterial work Russian Peasants and Soviet Power (1968) explores the clash between the world of the peasants and the priorities of an industrialising state in the late 1920s that had little sympathy or comprehension of the peasants&apos; outlook. Lewin retained a strong admiration for the founder of the Bolshevik state, and his book Lenin&apos;s Last Struggle (1968) outlined Lenin&apos;s ultimately forlorn attempt to create a self-regulating dictatorship that could undertake a project of socialist modernisation, while retaining some measure of popular consent. An ardent anti-Stalinist, Lewin was interested in the forces that nurtured state despotism. He believed that within Bolshevism, there lay the basis of a more humane, democratic form of socialism. His sympathies lay with Nikolai Bukharin and the rightists in the Communist party, whom he saw as having a greater understanding of the peasant masses than the Trotskyist left. He saw Bukharin&apos;s ideas as relevant to the renewal of the Soviet system in the post-Stalin era. His book Political Undercurrents in Soviet Economic Debates: From Bukharin to the Modern Reformers (1974) proved prescient. However, the political rehabilitation of Bukharin under Gorbachev in 1989 proved a brief spring and the dream of a socialist renaissance was soon swept aside. The rich collection of essays in The Making of the Soviet System (1985) encapsulates much of his thinking. The terms he coined to capture the encounter between the old and new \u2013 &quot;quicksand society&quot;, &quot;ruralisation of the towns&quot;, &quot;peasantisation of the working class&quot; \u2013 entered the language of scholarly debate. He believed in the role of the historian as a commentator on the past and the present. His book The Gorbachev Phenomenon: A Historical Interpretation (1988) analysed the reformist movement of the 1980s in terms of the emergence of a new, more educated society challenging the old order of bureaucratic authoritarianism. In Russia/USSR/Russia: The Drive and Drift of a Superstate (1995) and The Soviet Century (2005), he depicted the Stalinist system as a form of &quot;bureaucratic absolutism&quot; that came to outlive its function. Lewin was born in Vilnius, a region disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Russian-Jewish parents who died in the Holocaust. In June 1941 he escaped the advancing German army by clambering on to the back of a Soviet army lorry. He worked on collective farms, and then was employed as a furnace operator. In the summer of 1943 he enlisted in the Soviet army and spent the rest of the war in a school for officers. In 1946 he returned to Poland, but soon after emigrated to France. Five years later he settled in Israel, and worked first on a kibbutz and then as a journalist. He studied at Tel Aviv University, from where he received his BA in 1961. He completed his doctorate on the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture at the Sorbonne in Paris. Intellectually he was profoundly influenced by the Annales school of history, with its focus on the autonomy of social processes and their development in the longue dur\u00e9e (long term). He served briefly as a senior research fellow at Columbia University in New York City, and from 1968 to 1978 held a research post at the Centre for Russian and East European Studies at Birmingham University. He then returned to the US and took up a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until he retired in 1995. He seized the opportunities of the opening of the Soviet archives under Gorbachev. Always lively and provocative, he was an intellectual who spoke to a wider public. He had a considerable reputation in France, was a regular correspondent for Le Monde Diplomatique, and spent his final years in Paris. Those who knew him remember a battered cherub with a ready smile and a puckish sense of humour who exuded a youthful vitality and zest for life, and was a gregarious raconteur. \u2022 Moshe Lewin, historian, born 7 November 1921; died 14 August 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-09-27T17:29:31Z", "title": "Moshe Lewin obituary", "sentences": ["He studied at Tel Aviv University, from where he received his BA in 1961."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/27/moshe-lewin-obituary"}, {"tags": ["Internazionale", "Football", "Barcelona", "Rubin Kazan", "FC Copenhagen", "Panathinaikos", "Schalke", "Benfica", "Lyon", "Hapoel Tel Aviv", "Werder Bremen", "Sport", "Samuel Eto'o"], "article": "Internazionale, who face Tottenham in their next Champions League game, scored four past Werder Bremen without reply at San Siro with Samuel Eto&apos;o grabbing a hat-trick.

Further goals arrived after 27 and 81 minutes and Eto&apos;o also set up Wesley Sneijder for the third goal in the 34th minute.

According to statistics released by B&apos;Tselem, the Israeli human rights organisation, 6,371 Palestinians and 1,083 Israelis were killed during hostilities in the last decade, but on top of the list of casualties is the unquantifiable toll taken on the psyches of ordinary citizens throughout the region. Each generation has its own battle which shapes its political outlook: the second intifada joins a 60-year-old list, spanning the Lebanon war of the 1980s, the six-day war of 1967, all the way to the war of independence in 1948. Young Israelis and Palestinians who grew up in the shadow of the second intifada will be the soldiers, politicians and voters of the coming decades, and their future decisions will owe much to the effect the violence had on their formative years. Almost every Israeli knows someone killed during the conflict, whether in uniform during their compulsory service in the IDF or as a civilian during the wave of terror attacks by Palestinian militants. Dismissing their harrowing and horrific experiences, as many outsiders tend to do in their rush to lay all blame for the conflict at Israelis&apos; feet, is both unfair and unwise, given that Israelis have as much right to live in peace and security as their neighbours. Likewise, assuming that Palestinians&apos; resistance to Israeli occupation is born out of an inherent hatred for Jews, rather than being a direct and understandable reaction to decades of oppression is a dishonest stance to take. Especially during periods of intense conflict \u2013 such as the years following the September 2000 uprising \u2013 life for ordinary Palestinians has been a cycle of trauma, violence and aggression, leading inevitably to another generation devoted to resisting their occupiers and fighting tooth and nail for freedom. The tentacles of the intifada spread far further than Israeli and Palestinian soil, drawing in supporters and opponents from around the world, as was the case with me during my previous life in England. As I watched the second intifada unfold on the television news from the comfort of my London home, I felt the piercing stare of an Israeli Lord Kitchener penetrate the veneer of contentment behind which I dwelt. My country needed me, I knew, and with every bus that exploded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the feeling grew stronger that I should be playing my part in defending my people from the murderous militants who strove to destroy them. Watching impotently from the sidelines as the country went up in flames during 2002 was not an option I could bear much longer, and the belief grew that I too could &quot;do something&quot; for my people, linking me historically to the warriors of King David&apos;s army and all who came in between. And so it was that, in November 2004, I found myself in a barracks on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, struggling to pull on eight-holed combat boots and staring wide-eyed at my olive-clad reflection in the mirror of an army changing room. Within a matter of months, I would be on my first tour of duty in the heart of the West Bank, just another foot-soldier in the regiments of Israeli infantry, doing my damnedest to convince myself that this was the only way to ensure the survival of the Jewish people in their minuscule Mediterranean refuge. I was by no means alone in believing fighting fire with fire was the only way to defend Israel from its enemies: scores of foreign volunteers join the IDF each year with the same thoughts in mind, not to mention the thousands of native-born Israelis conscripted annually and taught to believe the only way to win peace is through power and conquest. Right or wrong (and it took me years to realise it was wrong), such irons are forged in the white heat of extreme hostilities such as the second intifada \u2013 and the price is still being paid by citizens on both sides. Similarly, of the dozens of Palestinians my age who I&apos;ve met and interviewed over the last four years, almost all speak of a mirror-image desire to fight for their country in the same way my peers and I took up arms for ours. Watching the continuing expropriation of their land, witnessing the daily humiliations suffered by their elders and betters at the hands of teenage soldiers, burying wave after wave of dead militants and civilians alike \u2013 regardless of the political decisions behind both sides&apos; intransigence, it would take superhuman strength not to be devastatingly affected by such brutal experiences. As part of the presentation of the 10-year anniversary statistics, B&apos;Tselem&apos;s executive director commented:  &quot;Palestinian and Israeli civilians have paid a terrible price due to the conflict. At the close of the decade, we hope to start a new chapter, in which both sides do all they can to adhere to their obligations and protect civilians from the impact of hostilities.&quot;   Her statement makes for an inoffensive and tamely upbeat soundbite, but there is little real likelihood of rapprochement any time soon. Given that the prospects for peace today are as bleak as they were a decade ago, it is almost inevitable that the cycle will continue long into the future, affecting untold numbers of Israelis and Palestinians for generations to come. This latest milestone only serves to remind all connected parties \u2013 young and old, Jewish and Muslim, rightwing or leftwing \u2013 that the only variables now are time and place. The conflict is embedded far too deeply for cosmetic actions to have any real, lasting effect at ground level. The best that can be hoped for is a delay until the outbreak of the next intifada. That it will erupt at some point is all but set in stone. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-10-01T08:30:00Z", "title": "The second intifada, 10 years on | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["My country needed me, I knew, and with every bus that exploded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the feeling grew stronger that I should be playing my part in defending my people from the murderous militants who strove to destroy them.", "And so it was that, in November 2004, I found myself in a barracks on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, struggling to pull on eight-holed combat boots and staring wide-eyed at my olive-clad reflection in the mirror of an army changing room."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/01/israel-palestine-intifada-10-years-on"}, {"tags": ["The Guardian", "National newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Media", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Archaeology", "Science"], "article": "Few places in the world are more difficult to report from than the Middle East. It is not just the physical danger that can face journalists. The unresolved religious and territorial conflicts that characterise the area are bitter, and have origins that reach through the centuries and spread out around the globe today. Passion, conviction and absolute belief confront the reporter on every side. One of the problems at the heart of the region&apos;s troubles is the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and among the most contested issues of that conflict is the future of East Jerusalem. In its south-east corner lies the Old City and the Temple Mount (as Jews and Christians know it) or al-Haram al-Sharif (as Muslims know it). This platform of land is a holy site of great importance for the world&apos;s Jews and Muslims. The first and second temples built here by the Jews were destroyed by the Babylonians and the Romans respectively. On the site now are the al-Aqsa mosque and the Islamic shrine on the pinnacle, the Dome of the Rock. It is a constant source of tension for Israeli-Palestinian relations. On 27 May this area was the setting for a feature the Guardian ran in G2, examining the lives of the Palestinian residents in Silwan, a community that lies along the southern flank of the Old City, and the effect on them and their homes of a series of archaeological digs that are being undertaken to look for the remains of Ir David, the City of David. The Israelis believe that it lies beneath the Wadi Helweh neighbourhood in Silwan. The article reported on the actions of Elad, a Jewish group that has dug a number of tunnels in the area to look for the remains of the City of David. Its work is supported by the Israeli government and is in conflict with many of the residents, who say their houses are sinking into the earth because of the excavations. The Palestinians fear that the tunnels \u2013 originating in Silwan \u2013 either go under the al-Aqsa mosque or are intended to, undermining the mosque&apos;s foundations. In the 2,500-word feature was a sentence that examined Elad&apos;s intentions: &quot;Elad set up a two-pronged strategy: to strengthen Israel&apos;s &apos;connection to Jerusalem&apos; they started to dig \u2013 under Silwan and into the land under the al-Aqsa mosque \u2013 for the biblical City of David and to create the Ir David tourist site.&quot; We have received only one complaint about the feature, contending that the sentence above is inaccurate: that the tunnels don&apos;t go under the mosque. Initially I felt that the sentence referred to the tunnels entering the land under the platform on which the mosque stands. The complainant objected to that interpretation and I agreed to look at it again. As part of that review I consulted former Jerusalem correspondents, two non-profit organisations that work with both communities, Emek Shaveh and Ir Amim, and Professor Israel Finkelstein, a leading archaeologist from Tel Aviv University. All believe the diggings are near the Temple Mount, but not under it. Daniel Seidemann is a founder of Ir Amim, the goal of which is a &quot;more sustainable and equitable city&quot;. Ir Amim produced a 47-page report last year \u2013 Shady Dealings in Silwan \u2013 looking at the issues in that part of Jerusalem. Seidemann said: &quot;There is massive tunnelling under Silwan leading towards the Temple Mount, there is massive tunnelling under Palestinian housing adjacent to the Mount, but there is no indication that it is under the Temple Mount, although public scrutiny is difficult.&quot; Finkelstein said: &quot;There is no excavation under the Temple Mount as far as I know. There are now five archaeological projects in the City of David: one is far from the Temple Mount at the southern tip of the City of David ridge; three are located about 250 metres or so away from the southern wall of the Temple platform. One is closer, about 75 metres or so, but has reached bedrock so there is no way to dig under the Temple Mount.&quot; I think there is ambiguity in the disputed sentence in the feature \u2013 the author agrees \u2013 and today a clarification has been published in the Corrections and clarification column. It took a long time \u2013 too long \u2013 to reach that conclusion, which I regret. And the decision will not settle any wider argument. Some may wonder why a few metres either way matters, or requires so much attention.

There is also the commonplace sociological assumption that while there might be a renewed interest in spirituality, a market in flaky &quot;new age&quot; explorations, and the attraction of extremist religious movements, &quot;mainstream&quot; religion has had its day. It is said that the four driving forces behind religious behaviour are compassion and a powerful sense of justice; a search for life&apos;s interpretative keys; the quest for transcendence; and institutional belonging and identity. It is certainly true that the latter is increasingly losing traction in Europe. There are multiple reasons. Not least is that in individualist cultures people prefer to construct identities and be &quot;socialised&quot; through \u2013 what they believe to be \u2013 their own efforts, the degree to which dress conformity is constructed by a canny clothes industry notwithstanding. Religious institutions are, on the whole, bad at accommodating these impulses. Uncontrolled developments from below can spell trouble. And whether in hierarchical or flat structures, sometimes they do. It might have been thought that the growing interfaith movement would have added to this erosion of fixed religious identities. For surely people of different faiths mixing and working together will undermine core beliefs and narratives? This is often the hidden fear. At root this may derive from the same old deep identity anxiety as the fear of miscegenation. But, ironically, if the experience of the Faiths Act programme of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation is anything to go by, interfaith action seems to have the opposite effect. In this fellowship programme 30 young people from different faiths are trained and paired together for social action. Many hundreds put themselves forward for the rigorous selection procedure. Whether Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist or Christian, those chosen were all committed to their faith and at ease with their \u2013 multiple \u2013 identities. One Muslim woman did once say that sometimes she wished she could be &quot;just me&quot; not &quot;the Muslim woman&quot;. Perhaps, not coincidentally, she was one of the most pious in her practice of prayer as well as sure of her identity. For those on the fellowship programme, a year spent on training and working together in different faith communities for the UN millennium development goals had one expected and one unexpected consequence. Deep and probably lasting friendships developed. But, in addition, most fellows felt a need to deepen their understanding of their own faith after making the journey into understanding another. The journey brought them back keen to &quot;drink from their own wells&quot;. That was a little counterintuitive, but made a great deal of sense. So my recommendation for the Ayatollah Kashanis of today, for those who fret about &quot;them&quot; falling away, while rarely actually talking to &quot;them&quot;, is to encourage some serious interfaith action, not to be fearful of it. There is quite enough fear in Europe already. \u2022 Applications to the Faiths Act Fellowship 2011/12 are currently open", "publicationDate": "2010-10-07T08:00:02Z", "title": "Multi-faith moan about youth is unjustified | Ian Linden", "sentences": ["You could have pirated the conversation and replayed it in Tel Aviv, Cairo or Galway without anyone noticing."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/oct/07/multi-faith-moan-youth-religion"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Eurovision", "Music", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "For a high-profile singer and actress with a three-album deal and a leading role in a forthcoming Israeli film, Mira Awad is unusually preoccupied with questions of identity. Tonight she will receive a human rights award from the New Israel Fund at the Bloomsbury Ballroom in London, along with the Israeli-Jewish singing star, Noa. But not everybody will be celebrating back home. As a Palestinian citizen of Israel, Awad is a member of a minority within the Jewish state that, while nominally equal, faces discrimination and challenges from both sides about loyalty and identity. The very reason for the award \u2013 her decision to represent Israel with Noa in the 2009 Eurovision Song contest \u2013 provoked a storm of controversy. &quot;Each side wants me to align myself with them,&quot; she says in her small Tel Aviv flat. &quot;Israelis would like me to show alliance with the Israeli state, to prove my loyalty. On the other side, I have to prove my loyalty to the Palestinians who ask if I have forgotten my father was kicked out of his village in 1948. &quot;I&apos;m tired of being cornered all the time, of having to explain myself. Most of the time I&apos;m making both sides unhappy because I don&apos;t do what they want. But I don&apos;t live in a black-and-white world. This place is very complicated.&quot; The collaboration between the two artists, which goes back 10 years, has been condemned as much as welcomed. During the 2008-09 three-week war on Gaza, Israel announced that its entry into last year&apos;s Eurovision competition would be sung by Noa and Awad. &quot;I didn&apos;t know if I wanted to represent this country,&quot; says Awad. &quot;I was very angry, [the war] was so devastating.&quot; A petition against Awad&apos;s participation, organised by Palestinian and Israeli leftists, called on the singer to withdraw. &quot;They said I couldn&apos;t represent a country that was killing my own people, that performing would give a green light to the killing of children in Gaza.&quot; After much thought, Awad decided to go ahead. Having made coexistence and dialogue the hallmark of her beliefs, she felt that she &quot;didn&apos;t want to walk out and slam the door. You can&apos;t solve anything when each is in his bunker.&quot; But there was another factor: the recent elevation of right-wing politician Avigdor Lieberman to the government. He had campaigned on the slogan &quot;no loyalty, no citizenship&quot;, in reference to Israel&apos;s Arab population. &quot;He meant me,&quot; says Awad. &quot;Suddenly I felt the importance of nailing my existence to the wall in a way no one could question. I am an Israeli citizen \u2013 and I&apos;m here to stay. Eurovision was my way of saying you [Lieberman] are not going to decide who is a citizen of this country. I was here before you.&quot; (Lieberman emigrated to Israel from Moldova in 1978 at the age of 20.) Awad feels proud of her decision, despite the censure. &quot;It opened a big window. People now listen to ideas of coexistence and dialogue.&quot; She had never considered the question of her identity while growing up in a Christian family in an Israeli-Arab village in Galilee. But as an unconventional teenager, the daughter of a Palestinian doctor and a Bulgarian mother, she faced tensions within her community. &quot;At 17, I had a bald head, a nose piercing and I was in a rock band, which was unusual. I was criticised for the way I looked and behaved, for being &apos;out on the loose&apos;, for the people I associated with.&quot; The environment, she says, was not particularly conservative or repressive, &quot;but certain things were expected. The criticism made trouble with my family. People went to my father and said your daughter is smoking cigarettes and drinking beers.&quot; Was that true? &quot;Of course,&quot; she says, laughing. &quot;My father would have preferred if I had gone with the stream and not against it, but eventually he understood and we&apos;re great friends. But this was my first fight \u2013 for my own opinions, my own way of life, my own vision, the things I want for myself.&quot; Awad studied English literature and fine art at university in Haifa, a city with a large Israeli-Arab population, but after two years she moved to Tel Aviv to focus on music. &quot;I moved into Israeli society. Then I understood the complexity of being a Palestinian in Israel, having that very rich Palestinian identity, but also feeling that you belong here. You&apos;re part of this country, but also an outsider.&quot; She encountered little overt racism. &quot;Because I don&apos;t fit the stereotype, I&apos;m not dark-skinned, I was mistaken for &apos;one of us&apos;. But people, little by little, expose their thoughts and they discover that, hey, after all they are racist.&quot; Despite her strong views, Awad says she doesn&apos;t write explicitly political songs. &quot;Even those that reflect a situation or something I saw on the news, I would write in emotional terms.&quot; She is recording the first of three albums in a deal signed with Sony, singing mostly in Arabic. She describes one of her songs, Our Relationship. &quot;You can understand it in terms of a relationship between two people, or between two peoples. Our problem is a relationship one \u2013 mistrust, fear, doubt.&quot; Awad is well known in Israel as an actress as well as a musician, but she won&apos;t be drawn on the details of her forthcoming film, only saying that she will be playing a Jewish character. She has previously played a Jewish settler and an ultra-Orthodox Jew on stage. &quot;I think I&apos;m the first Arab actress to have done that. I made it a purpose. I wanted to be treated as an actress, not an Arab actress, not be imprisoned inside that.&quot; Awad will donate tonight&apos;s award money to Kayan, a Haifa charity that aims to empower Arab women. &quot;We are a society that is still run by patriarchal rules,&quot; she says. &quot;The father decides for the whole family, and then the husband decides. Women must have the power to choose differently, whether it&apos;s a career, hobbies or a sexual life, if that&apos;s what they want.&quot; However, she rejects the notion that she is a role model for young Palestinian women, saying some people disagree with the choices she has made. &quot;Each and every person must have the freedom to make their own choices.&quot; She believes firmly in the value of small changes. &quot;I think things have got better in the past 15 years. There is more openness to the duality of this state&apos;s story, the pain and loss on both sides. I think, today, ears are open to our side of the story.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-10-09T14:20:16Z", "title": "Mira Awad: Israel's Palestinian singing star caught between worlds", "sentences": ["&quot;Each side wants me to align myself with them,&quot; she says in her small Tel Aviv flat.", "But this was my first fight \u2013 for my own opinions, my own way of life, my own vision, the things I want for myself.&quot; Awad studied English literature and fine art at university in Haifa, a city with a large Israeli-Arab population, but after two years she moved to Tel Aviv to focus on music."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/09/mira-awad-israel-palestinian-star"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Human rights", "Global economy", "Middle East and North Africa", "Business", "World news"], "article": "What can be said for the state of international law when international organisations such as the OECD find themselves unable to prevent a member country from bringing its unlawful practice into the life of the organisation itself? In such situations, how can law-abiding member countries avoid being drawn into acquiescence? Later this month, these questions may find answers when Israel hosts an OECD gathering in Jerusalem to discuss global tourism. The OECD is an international economic organisation of 33 countries, with the latest controversial addition to this club being Israel. The OECD explains its mission as providing &quot;a setting where governments compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and co-ordinate domestic and international policies&quot;. At minimum, one would expect the co-ordination of these &quot;international policies&quot; to remain within the bounds of international law. At Israel&apos;s invitation, the 86th session of the OECD tourism committee will take place in Jerusalem on 20 and 21 October to discuss supporting a sustainable and competitive tourism industry for the benefit of the members&apos; economies. The session will be attended by senior government officials from OECD member countries and key emerging economies. This is only the second time that the meeting has been held outside Paris. Israel will conduct itself as the host and as an OECD member based on the Israeli ministry of tourism&apos;s unlawful unilateral extension of its jurisdiction to include occupied East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and touristic sites and businesses in those parts of the West Bank reserved for Israeli settlement. Israel&apos;s ministry of tourism website clearly lists tourist sites in occupied territory, such as the Dome of the Rock and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, as Israeli sites. The ministry&apos;s websites also publicise settlement-based tourist services licensed by the ministry and receiving Israeli state financial support under the ministry&apos;s auspices. They present maps that depict the entire territory of historic Palestine west of the Jordan river, as well as the Syrian Golan, as territory of Israel that falls under Israel&apos;s national tourism-related and cultural heritage-related responsibility. Despite OECD efforts to the contrary, photographs of touristic sites in occupied territory have been incorporated in a website that Israel has constructed under OECD auspices. Last month, the Right to Enter campaign \u2013 a grassroots campaign for the freedom of movement to/from and within the occupied Palestinian territories, for which we volunteer \u2013 wrote to each OECD member to explain the situation and the harm that will be done by allowing such Israeli practice under OECD auspices, and by acquiescing to Israel&apos;s insistence on basing its participation in the OECD on its illegal acts of annexation and settlement in occupied territory. All OECD member countries refuse to recognise Israel&apos;s illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and have therefore insisted in keeping their embassies in Tel Aviv instead of Israel&apos;s self-proclaimed &quot;unified&quot; capital. They presumably would not want to be drawn into acts or omissions that would imply that Israeli practice resulting from the very acts of annexation and settlement they condemn as internationally unlawful can be considered legitimate under the OECD&apos;s auspices. It remains to be seen how they will manage to avoid such missteps. It is hardly encouraging that during the runup to the tourism meeting web pages bearing the OECD emblem continue to advertise touristic and cultural heritage sites in the occupied Palestinian territories as Israeli. It is difficult to overlook the fact that Israel has been permitted to base its performance of its obligations and conduct its participation in OECD activities on its own policies of settlement and annexation, notwithstanding the duty of the OECD and its member countries not to recognise these Israeli practices as lawful or give them effect within the OECD. Countries planning to attend include Spain, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. For those countries that decide to attend, the devil will be in the details. The proficiency of their delegates at identifying and preventing the importation of Israel&apos;s violations of international law into the proceedings and surrounding events will be sorely tested. It can make no sense for world leaders to allow themselves to be drawn progressively into acquiescing to Israel&apos;s serious and persistent violations of international law while continuing to demand that Palestinians respect and place their confidence in international law after 62 years of dispossession and 43 years of military occupation. Yet Israel has become a habitual violator and has also become highly proficient at dragging other states along with it. If the OECD and its member countries cannot be expected to effectively resist this pull, who can be expected to hold the line? Who is left to defend the normative foundations of the just and peaceful world order that states and international organisations like the OECD regularly proclaim their resolve to promote? \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T11:00:00Z", "title": "Can the OECD stand up to Israel? | Sam Bahour and Charles Shamas", "sentences": ["All OECD member countries refuse to recognise Israel&apos;s illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and have therefore insisted in keeping their embassies in Tel Aviv instead of Israel&apos;s self-proclaimed &quot;unified&quot; capital."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/12/israel-oecd-tourism-summit"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Yossi Benayoun has admitted his surprise and dismay that Chelsea&apos;s medical staff &quot;missed&quot; detecting the seriousness of an achilles injury after the Israel international was tonight ruled out for up to six months.

Benayoun had been dogged by a tendon problem since the beginning of the season, with his club under the impression that it was treatable with careful management, only for scans at Tel Aviv&apos;s Assuta hospital to reveal a more disturbing reality. &quot;The truth is that this entire situation is very strange,&quot; Benayoun said. &quot;I had three MRIs and three ultrasounds and they all said that there was no problem, and it was just a small tear. &quot;I came to Israel ready to play and they told me it was a big tear. Chelsea were sure it was something small. They have compared all the images and they do not understand how they missed it. They said it is unusual to have such a big tear and not be in terrible pain. Even now I am not in pain but I cannot take one step by myself until I undergo surgery.&quot; Benayoun has not played since apparently tearing a calf muscle in the Carling Cup defeat to Newcastle last month, though he was permitted to travel to Israel \u2013 via a visit to Marijana Kovacevic, whose treatments include the use of fluids from a cow&apos;s placenta, in Belgrade \u2013 to join up with the national squad.

The young Dutch defender Jeffrey Bruma, who has been suffering from a tight hamstring which led to his being omitted from the Holland under-21s squad in midweek, is due to join the rest of the first-team squad today and could be asked to partner Branislav Ivanovic at centre-half at Villa Park.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T19:08:04Z", "title": "Yossi Benayoun perplexed by Chelsea's failure to spot torn achilles", "sentences": ["Benayoun had been dogged by a tendon problem since the beginning of the season, with his club under the impression that it was treatable with careful management, only for scans at Tel Aviv&apos;s Assuta hospital to reveal a more disturbing reality."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/13/yossi-benayoun-chelsea-achilles-injury"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "John Terry", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2010-11"], "article": "Carlo Ancelotti has been forced to revise his recently implemented policy of only selecting John Terry when the centre-half is fully fit and will play his captain at Aston Villa tomorrow after untimely injuries left his squad severely depleted. Terry was ruled out of England&apos;s Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro in midweek after falling awkwardly in training last Friday, and suffering spasms and bruising to his back. He has not been able to train fully at Cobham since returning to the Premier League champions, but will be asked to play at Villa Park. Ancelotti is without the services of Alex, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba, and wary of the hosts&apos; threat in the air. Ancelotti said only last month that Terry, who turns 30 in December, has &quot;to be realistic&quot; and rest when suffering from even minor injuries to prolong his career for club and country, yet necessity has forced the Italian&apos;s hand. &quot;This is a different moment,&quot; the Chelsea manager said. &quot;He is not 100%, no. He had a problem with his back and tried to train, and it wasn&apos;t perfect. I&apos;ll ask him if he&apos;s fit to play, but he is in my team at the moment. But Villa are dangerous from set pieces because they have good jumpers. Missing Alex and Drogba is a blow, so we have to find solutions.&quot; The centre-half, who is still suffering from bruising to his lower back, will be required to travel to Moscow with the squad on Sunday ahead of Tuesday&apos;s awkward Champions League tie against Spartak, on an artificial pitch at the Luzhniki Stadium, where Chelsea will need his experience off the pitch even if he is not risked on it. Drogba, who has been suffering from a fever this week that has prevented him from training, will miss that trip, while Lampard is still at least two weeks away from a return as he continues his rehabilitation after a groin operation. Ancelotti named his side for tomorrow&apos;s trip to Villa \u2013 where Chelsea have won only once in 12 visits in all competitions \u2013 with his options limited. Alex and Salomon Kalou remain unavailable with thigh complaints, while Daniel Sturridge has suffered a knock to his ankle. Ga\u00ebl Kakuta will start the game as the champions attempt to maintain their early season lead at the summit. Drogba&apos;s absence comes as a surprise, though Ancelotti remains convinced he still has the attacking talent to maintain his team&apos;s momentum. &quot;Didier&apos;s been on antibiotics but will need to train next week to be fit,&quot; Ancelotti said. &quot;I&apos;m surprised that we have five points more than [Manchester] United after only seven games, but it&apos;ll be a long season.

The 30-year-old had been released, complete with the Chelsea doctor&apos;s report and independent scan results, under instruction not to train or play in his country&apos;s Euro 2012 qualifiers against Croatia and Greece as he was still recovering from the calf injury sustained in the Carling Cup defeat to Newcastle last month. However, Benayoun underwent a scan at Tel Aviv&apos;s Assuta hospital late on 5 October, with the national team doctor, Mark Rosnovsky, duly confirming that he was suffering from a serious tear to his tendon. He will undergo surgery in Finland on Monday before a lengthy period of rehabilitation. Chelsea will speak with the Israeli Football Federation to try to ascertain when the injury occurred. &quot;When he left this club to go to Israel, his achilles tendon did not have a problem,&quot; Ancelotti said. &quot;I trust my doctor at this club, and we are sure.

You want to get a panorama of the stage but not be looking down \u2013 unless it&apos;s dance, when\u00a0sitting towards the middle of the first circle means you can see the patterns and how the whole thing comes together. Alan Davey, chief executive, Arts Council England What is the optimum way to appreciate architecture? Walking is the only way. You want a good mix of weather and a day off. Manchester is a great place for this: it can be sunny, but always rains a little bit, so you&apos;re forced inside occasionally. You&apos;ve got to push yourself, break some rules and go to places you&apos;re not allowed. You can&apos;t appreciate architecture until you&apos;ve been told off for going to a room you&apos;re\u00a0not supposed to. Tim\u00a0Abrahams,\u00a0associate editor, Blueprint magazine Which works withstand repeated viewings? A great work is more than a one-liner. Personally, I would plump for anything\u00a0by C\u00e9zanne. His composition, the light, the beauty and intelligence \u2013 he was an extraordinary artist and always pushing the form. Will\u00a0Gompertz, BBC\u00a0arts editor Is it ever OK to heckle at a live performance? Not unless you enjoy being humiliated in public \u2013 always remember that, if you heckle, the comedian is the one\u00a0with the microphone. And if you\u00a0don&apos;t mind being picked on, sit\u00a0in\u00a0the front rows. Shappi Khorsandi, comedian How much should I trust reviews? The simple answer is that it depends what they&apos;re saying and who&apos;s saying it. Evelyn Waugh said that reading reviews is &quot;like sitting in a railway carriage and hearing a fellow traveller pointing out objects of interest and getting them all wrong&quot;. Mostly true, but some theatre critics do have a gift for describing a performance and giving an account of how the audience\u00a0responded. Others, following editorial policy, record merely whether the show is a hit or a miss. Others still are prescriptive: they write about the play or production or performance they would like to have seen, rather than the one they did. In short, they write about themselves rather than the event. If the overwhelming bulk of reviews are bad, it&apos;s foolish not to concede that you have a failure \u2013 but that&apos;s not the same as conceding that you&apos;ve done bad work. Richard Eyre, theatre director Is a theatre programme ever worth the money? A good programme adds to the pleasure\u00a0of an evening. It should tell you all you need to know about the background to the play and the writer. Best value in London: National Theatre programmes, which are pocket\u00a0encyclopedias; and Royal Court ones, where the programme is the play-text. Michael Billington, Guardian\u00a0theatre critic Which venues have the best and worst acoustics? I don&apos;t really care about a venue&apos;s acoustics; if I wanted a perfect sonic experience, I&apos;d stay at home and listen through my Grado headphones. Live rock isn&apos;t about a perfect sonic experience: if a band&apos;s powerful enough, they can overcome anything a venue throws at them. I always thought Alexandra Palace in London had terrible acoustics until I\u00a0saw Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds there: they sounded magnificent. Likewise, Brixton Academy has swallowed bands that weren&apos;t ready to play a venue that size (such as the Strokes); but REM and Coldplay, bands obviously used to playing bigger\u00a0places, sounded great there. Alexis Petridis, Guardian rock and pop\u00a0critic Should I read the caption to an artwork before looking at it \u2013 or after?  Do both: before, because you get an understanding of where an artist is coming from; and after, because the work can make a more sense. A lot of conceptual art is about the ideas, so it makes sense to get a framework. Ekow Eshun, outgoing artistic director, ICA Sometimes captions illuminate, but often they are dull, or try to tell you what to think. Generally, I ignore them. Use your eyes. Adrian Searle, Guardian art critic Artists use titles to encrypt or deceive as much as to assist the audience in reading their work. It depends on the artist. Ryan Gander, artist How do I get the perfect cinema experience? Choose your film carefully. And make sure you sit in the reclining seats, which cost a bit more. They&apos;re definitely worth it. I go in the afternoon: you have the whole cinema to yourself. Charlotte Rampling, actor Which performance of a show is the one to catch? Halfway through the run \u2013 when the cast is relaxed, but not bored. Not on press nights and not on Saturday nights, when their heads are too caught up with &quot;important people&quot; watching. Midweek matinees and Monday nights are best; the actors are less worried and enjoy it more. Rory Kinnear, actor Where can I see the most innovative new work? Try the Kaai or Kunstenfestival in Brussels, Hebbel Theatre in Berlin, PS\u00a0122 in New York, Frascati in Amsterdam, BIT in Bergen. In the UK, there&apos;s the National Review of Live Art in Glasgow or the Nuffield Theatre in Lancaster.  Tim Etchells, Forced Entertainment theatre troupe How can I tell if an actor doesn&apos;t know his lines? Copious sweating, stuttering and uncertainty. It&apos;s like being on a plane when the pilots aren&apos;t sure what they&apos;re doing. It&apos;s not always that actors don&apos;t know the lines, more a momentary lapse in concentration. Lyn Gardner, Guardian theatre critic What should I wear to the opera? Halfway between what you&apos;d wear for the ballet and what you&apos;d wear to a black tie party. If the ballet is a pale cashmere sweater and sparkly skirt, and black tie is a strapless LBD, the opera is perhaps a slinky but not skintight silk dress. You should have something of the night about you, but not in a sleazy way. For men? You can&apos;t go wrong with a dark, slim suit. Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardian fashion\u00a0editor Do critics ever consider the value for money a show offers? No. On that basis you would say that a five-hour epic that&apos;s truly ghastly must be of more value than Samuel Beckett&apos;s Breath, which lasts 30 seconds. One might be aware, when reviewing something in the West End, that people will be asked to pay \u00a350 or more, but on the whole critics don&apos;t account for that at all. Lyn Gardner \u00a0Is it worth buying tickets for preview performances? If it&apos;s the easiest way of getting tickets, it&apos;s well worth it. It&apos;s great to see something before reviewers, so you can judge for yourself. Alan Davey Not the first one. It&apos;s going to be shaky and awkward. Roy Williams, playwright What&apos;s the best way to enjoy an exhibition? Rain is always useful; it&apos;s the perfect weather for introspection. And mid-afternoon, midweek \u2013 when it&apos;s always nice and quiet. Jennifer Higgie, co-editor, Frieze magazine Is there a way to buy a ticket to a sold-out show? Yes. Shows sell out months in advance and people change their mind. Be flexible, always call the box office, and go for the returns. In plenty of West End theatres, if you arrive an hour before curtain-up, you can get house seats at a fraction of the normal price. Tania Harrison, arts curator, Latitude festival Is it worth taking children to the theatre? Children enjoy the attendant things with theatre: the ice-cream, lights going down, the magic of it. Any good production can make that come alive and it&apos;s probably more important to see how their tastes develop. The worst way is to force it, and insist they see Shakespeare, or enjoy Tennessee Williams. Children don&apos;t have to buy into the hegemony of what is good. Rory Kinnear Where can I find the next big thing in pop? The weekly indie club White Heat in London&apos;s Soho has uncovered its fair share of alternative stars: Klaxons, the Horrors and Bloc Party all played there before they had record deals. Krissi Murison, editor, NME What&apos;s the best destination for a culture-stuffed holiday? London, Paris and New York remain amazing places to visit for sheer complexity and intensity. Rio de Janeiro has one of the most dynamic art scenes in the world, as do Mumbai, Dehli, Beijing, Shanghai, Beirut, Cairo and Tel Aviv. Besides the great European capitals, Glasgow, Oslo and Stockholm offer a true polyphony. Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator, Serpentine gallery, London Should I research an artist or play before seeing their show? Never read the play first if it&apos;s new, and always see the work before getting the context. Try to find out what it means to you first before reading up on it. Judith\u00a0Knight, director of ArtsAdmin Where can I spot the art stars of tomorrow? Simple: go to art-school degree shows. Both the BA and MA ones at St Martin&apos;s, Wimbledon, Chelsea and Glasgow will be packed with dealers, but you get a good sense of what&apos;s happening in art and which trends are emerging. Ekow Eshun How long should I spend looking at a single painting? There is no &quot;should&quot; about it. Look for as long as you like. Sometimes a glance is sufficient, an hour not long enough. One might return to works over years, or even decades, and they will continue to offer new insights. The\u00a0work itself might not change, but you do. Adrian Searle Some works might seem off-putting or even dull, but with persistence you might find them profoundly satisfying. Go to a museum to learn, not to consume. Jonathan Jones, Guardian art critic Do any arts venue cafes or restaurants offer decent food? Theatre and museum restaurants rarely offer good value, but some do have other attractions. The Whistler murals at Tate Britain&apos;s dining room are an attraction, and the wines there are famously impressive. Tate Modern&apos;s seventh-floor dining room has impressive City views. And the Wallace Collection&apos;s restaurant has a fantastic atrium setting. But one always ends up thinking: if only the food lived up to the surroundings. Richard Harden, co-editor of Harden&apos;s London Restaurants Should I attempt to see an artist&apos;s entire oeuvre?  It&apos;s impossible to see everything, but often one can fully experience an artist through just one artwork, or by exploring a single aspect of that artist. I&apos;ve always had the dream to see all the works of Vermeer. There are only a little over 70 works and an exhibition of all of them would be extraordinary, a\u00a0real epiphany. Hans Ulrich Obrist Which museum has the best gift shop? The Baltic&apos;s gift shop is probably the\u00a0best shop in Newcastle or Gateshead, let alone the best art or museum store. The Tate and V&amp;A also do it well. The National Gallery offers print-on-demand reproductions for any picture in the building on canvas: plus posters and greeting cards are all popular.

Leigh said he was not prepared to take part in the &quot;great masters&quot; programme at the Sam Spiegel Film &amp; Television School in Jerusalem. In a letter to school director Renen Schorr, he cited several of Israel&apos;s policies, including the oath, which would require non-Jews seeking Israeli citizenship to pledge allegiance to Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot;. &quot;As you know, I have always had serious misgivings about coming, but I allowed myself to be persuaded by your sincerity and your commitment,&quot; Leigh wrote. &quot;And it is because of those special qualities of yours that I am especially sorry to have to let you down. But I have absolutely no choice. I cannot come, I do not want to come, and I am not coming. &quot;Eight weeks after our lunch, the Israeli attack on the flotilla took place.

I still had not faced up to the prospect of pulling out until a few weeks ago, but the resumption of the illegal building on the West Bank made me start to consider it seriously. And now we have the Loyalty Oath. &quot;This is the last straw \u2013 quite apart from the ongoing criminal blockade of Gaza, not to mention the endless shooting of innocent people there, including juveniles ...&quot; Schorr responded with his own letter, in which he cited Sam Spiegel&apos;s record of working with Palestinian film-makers and said the school should not be punished for the actions of the Israeli government. &quot;We agreed to convene a press conference where you had an open platform to express your sharp objections to Israeli policy, should you have desired,&quot; he said. &quot;The reverberation of the words you spoke here \u2013 from Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jenin \u2013 would have been heard so much differently. &quot;Here, too, you were presented with the genuine opportunity to speak to hearts and minds, and have a direct influence upon public awareness and opinion. To touch the future. To try to change the realities. Yet now you have chosen to stay distant.&quot; A number of film-makers and actors have chosen to boycott Israel film festivals and other events in recent years over the country&apos;s political actions.

It started with Dortmund&apos;s 2-1 away win at K\u00f6ln on Friday night, a full-on affair that left everybody involved slightly disorientated. For Borussia, it was a case of (altitude-induced) nosebleed: their seventh win in a row catapulted them to the top of the table past Mainz (1-0 losers at home to Hamburg), an unfamiliar position they haven&apos;t enjoyed for 3,087 long days, since they won the 2001-02 season. In his elation, Kevin Gro\u00dfkreutz channelled both Martin Luther King and Enrico, the frighteningly unfunny clown from 1980s Austrian TV kids show &quot;AmDamDes&quot; (catchphrase: &quot;Soll ich sagen? Ich sage nicht&quot; - should I say it? I won&apos;t say) in the same breath. &quot;We dream about the championship, but we don&apos;t talk about,&quot; said the 22-year-old international. It&apos;s a clever ploy, that. Manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp quickly warmed to the theme and took not talking about the Meisterschaft to the next level. &quot;We are not talking about the Meisterschaft, I couldn&apos;t care less about the table,&quot; insisted the 43-year-old. &quot;I have 0.0% interest in the table. Anyone talking about winning the league now has no idea about football,&quot; added sporting director Michael Zorc. But the most eloquent non-discussion of BVB&apos;s title credentials came from Hans-Joachim Watzke. &quot;Being top after eight games means nothing,&quot; said Borussia CEO. &quot;It&apos;s totally unrealistic to talk about the championship. We are not ready to burden our seven, eight players who aren&apos;t even 23 years old yet with that kind of baggage. Setbacks are guaranteed to happen.&quot; In fact, dreamers and realists were proven right in roughly equal measure by the thrilling contest in the RheinEnergieStadion. Dortmund, unperturbed by idiots who had shattered a glass window of the team bus with a brick before kick-off, completely dominated their opponents with high-tempo, slick attacking football from the get-go and took the well-deserved lead (Blaszczykowski, 20&apos;). Plenty more excellent chances came and went without before the break. K\u00f6ln, plagued by internal rifts \u2013 dropped goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon had left the team hotel the night before the match in protest, Lukas Podolski had given a highly critical interview \u2013 were nowhere. In the second half, however, Dortmund tried to conserve a bit of energy. They relied on counter-attacks but didn&apos;t execute them properly. With the crowd waking up, the home side started believing. Borussia came under immense pressure, even the formidable centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels suddenly looked shaky. Podolski&apos;s fine equaliser arrived late but totally deserved. &quot;We gave them too much space,&quot; conceded Turkish midfielder Nuri Sahin later. Last season, Dortmund often took unnecessary risks after going one up and ended up with nothing. This year, the plan was to play more rationally. &quot;We have worked on that in the summer,&quot; Klopp said. Friday night suggested that much more work will be needed. &quot;This team are not good at administrating [a game], they always want to create,&quot; said Watzke. &quot;Full throttle is what they do best.&quot; Dortmund&apos;s reaction to the equaliser bore that out. They flooded forward again, with &quot;greed and passion&quot;, the will to win was greater than the fear of losing the game. It was fitting and especially sweet that Sahin, their best player of the season so far, scored the last-minute winner: Podolski had provoked him with &quot;3-0&quot; gestures (in reference to Germany&apos;s win over Turkey) after the equaliser. Sahin, who is now showing the very Cesc-like qualities that had Ars\u00e8ne Wenger track him as a teenager, celebrated his goal right under the nose of the Germany striker. Both were booked for their troubles but made up after the final whistle. Dortmund&apos;s squad depth makes them a more realistic contender than Mainz to indeed go all the way. A prolonged excursion in the Europa League might still come to hurt their domestic ambitions come spring, however, especially if they don&apos;t manage to slow down a little. Sahin told Ruhr Nachrichten how assistant coach Zeljko Buvac had tried to calm them down during the recent win over Kaiserslautern. &quot;When we were 3-0 up, he asked us to pace ourselves. Next second, Hummels is rushing forward as if there&apos;s no tomorrow. How was I supposed to stop him?&quot; The game finished 5-0. Kloppo&apos;s boys might yet hit the wall at some stage but in the meantime, it looks as if greed is indeed good in this particular remake. &quot;None of us has won any significant titles, of course we&apos;re hungry,&quot; said Hummels. Expect more talk of not talking about the championship in weeks to come and quite a bit of dreaming, too. Borussia top, Schalke going down and Bayern nowhere: it&apos;s the stuff black and yellow fantasies are made of. Talking points \u2022 You don&apos;t need a degree in sabermetrics to understand the strong correlation between wages and performance in professional football - more equals more, generally speaking. In Bremen, however, they seem to have discovered a different dynamic. Following some poor results, only 50% of September&apos;s wages were paid out to the players. Sporting director Klaus Allofs didn&apos;t officially confirm employing the legally dubious tactic that is widely used in Serie A but has never been seen in the Bundesliga before. &quot;We have taken measures that helped the team develop,&quot; he said cryptically. Seven points in October, including three against unfortunate Freiburg on Saturday, seem to have vindicated the populist policy but it&apos;s questionable how much impact the move has really had on the players. After speaking to the German PFA, they all knew that Bremen could at worst delay the payment of the wages for a few weeks, not dock them altogether. Next month&apos;s pay-cheque will compensate them in full. &quot;Allofs seemed embarrassed that he could only throw cotton wool (at the players) instead of putting them into the thumbscrews he seeked,&quot; wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. No wonder Marko Arnautovic told reporters that the story was &quot;never an issue&quot; after the 2-1 win over Robin Dutt&apos;s team. \u2022 Another under-performing club took a more traditional approach: Stuttgart fired their Swiss manager Christian Gross before the 2-2 draw with fellow strugglers Schalke 04. The Swabians were apparently unwilling to wait for their customary second half of the season rally under a new manager and thus pulled the plug a little earlier than usual. Former player Jens Keller, who swiftly stabbed Gross in the back last week (&quot;he never listened to my ideas&quot;) was put in charge on a trial basis. His side attacked the mostly shambolic Royal Blues with renewed gusto and were unfortunate to suffer another costly refereeing mistake. A probably decisive strike from Cacau that would have made it 2-0 to the visitors was wrongly ruled offside. &quot;As of now, we&apos;re in a relegation fight,&quot; said Schalke&apos;s defender Christoph Metzelder. Suddenly, Wednesday&apos;s Champions League game against Hapoel Tel Aviv seems little more than an unwelcome distraction. \u2022 Saturday saw Steve McClaren&apos;s most impressive Bundesliga performance to date \u2013 before the game. The Wolfsburg manager spoke rather excellent German in the pre-match interview. His team were also extremely fluid, at least until 20 minutes from time, when Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Simon Rolfes was brought on in the Volkswagenarena. The German international who missed the World Cup with a knee injury, turned the 2-0 deficit (goals from the divine Diego and Grafite) into a spectacular 3-2 win with two assists and an 82nd minute winner. It was the third time Wolves lost a match late on after leading comfortably. The Englishman blamed &quot;two crazy minutes&quot; and silly mistakes from keeper Marwin Hitz and defender Makoto Hasebe for the turn-around. Bild dubbed him &quot;Steve McSiege-weg&quot; (Steve McWinsGone) but it&apos;s unlikely that this nickname will catch on. \u2022 On the face of it, being stuck in a Chilean mine for months and nearly dying doesn&apos;t really compare with the plight of being Europe&apos;s most expensive bench-warming striker. But that didn&apos;t stop Bayern Munich&apos;s Mario Gomez ascribing his hat-trick against Hannover to fate. &quot;When I heard that there was a Mario Gomez among the men and that 33 of them were saved, I had a good feeling, I knew it wasn&apos;t a coincidence,&quot; said the 25-year-old who wears the, wait for it, No33 shirt. At one stage of his post-match interview, the international claimed he had 33 text messages on his mobile, too, but then retreated from reading too much into &quot;Chilean mumbo jumbo&quot;. His 63-year-old namesake sent some good wishes nevertheless. &quot;I&apos;d like to come to Germany&quot;, he (allegedly) told Bild: &quot;I&apos;m no competition for him. He has to get the ball in, I only wanted to get out.&quot; Louis van Gaal, who had been more than happy to send the miner/striker to Liverpool on loan in August, has promised to stick with Gomez the Younger for Tuesday&apos;s CL match with Cluj. \u2022 Thomas Tuchel bemoaned &quot;a lack of discipline&quot; and &quot;too much wild play&quot; after his team&apos;s first defeat of the season. Hamburg&apos;s late winner in the Bruchwegstadion (Paolo Guerrero struck after Ze Roberto stole the ball in the box in the 89th minute) saw a decent Mainz lose their lead at the top and the chance to set a new Bundesliga record with eight opening wins. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed but our world won&apos;t collapse,\u00e6 said the coach. He would have managed to bear the hype a little longer, he added, but perhaps the defeat came at a good time. With Leverkusen and Dortmund up next, the Mainz players might be grateful that &quot;the media circus&quot; (Tuchel) has temporarily moved on.

A young mother of two girls with another on the way, Ahmoud says recent moves by the Israeli government are making it increasingly obvious that the Arabs are not welcome in their own country. &quot;I feel like my life is not in my hands,&quot; said 24-year-old Ahmoud, who lives in Umm al-Fahm, a mountain-ridge town of some 43,000 inhabitants in northern Israel. &quot;The government decides how I live and where I live. We exist in fear, from one day to the next.&quot; Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, famously referred to Arab citizens of Israel, who make up a fifth of the population, as a &quot;demographic bomb&quot; in 2003. His cabinet recently passed a new citizens bill that, if approved, will require all non-Jewish migrants to pledge loyalty to Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot; \u2013 although, apparently in response to international pressure, the law may now be amended to apply to all new migrants, including Jews. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) points to a string of other laws in the pipeline that would require individuals from parliamentarians to film crews to swear their allegiance. During the latest round of peace talks, Netanyahu reiterated that the Palestinian Authority should recognise Israel as a Jewish state \u2013 again signalling the preference for an ethno-religious Israel rather than a state for all its citizens. Just weeks ago, Israeli forces staged a training exercise to test the state&apos;s response to a potential revolt among its Arab citizens if a peace agreement involved their forced transfer to a new Palestinian state. In a comprehensive security drill, forces practised anti-riot tactics and established two detention centres to accommodate prisoners. Israel&apos;s extreme-right foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has ratcheted up talk of a population exchange with the Palestinian Authority, whereby illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank would become part of Israel while Arab towns such as Umm al-Fahm, in the northern area bordering the West Bank, would be turned over to a new Palestinian state. Today in Umm al-Fahm, where the loyalty oath is referred to as &quot;Lieberman&apos;s law&quot;, there is a sense of living inside a paradox. &quot;On the one hand, the state is saying to us that, as Arabs, we are a danger and not welcome here,&quot; said Said Abu Shakra, the director of Umm al-Fahm&apos;s art gallery. &quot;But on the other hand, we are constantly asked to prove our loyalty to the state.&quot; While supportive of the Palestinian struggle for statehood, this population - which identifies itself as Palestinian-Arab or Palestinian-Israeli - has repeatedly indicated its wish to retain Israeli citizenship. Its struggle is for equality. &quot;Where else would I go? My life, my children, my future is here,&quot; said one 28-year-old mother of two, who did not wish to be named. &quot;I don&apos;t have another place, but what can we do to stop it if they [Jewish Israelis] are the strong ones?&quot; Residents of Umm al-Fahm, which is thought to date back to 1265, talk of family roots in the area stretching back hundreds of years. &quot;We find ourselves thinking about these things now,&quot; 50-year-old lawyer Adnan Asad said of a possible population exchange. &quot;I think, if you do transfer us, just do it when the kids are still young so that they might have a change to adapt. We&apos;re making jokes about what we&apos;ll sell when we become the street traders from the Palestinian state that stand at Israeli junctions.&quot; Recent developments have drawn protest from some Israelis who say they are alarmed by their government&apos;s &quot;anti-democratic&quot; and &quot;fascist&quot; legislation. ACRI has asked the prime minister to make clear that there are no transfer plans on the negotiating table, and l ast weekend, thousands demonstrated agaisnt the policies in Tel Aviv. Speaking at the protest, Knesset member Dov Khenin, of the leftwing Arab-Jewish party Hadash, warned: &quot;The population transfer has turned from a nightmare into an operational plan.&quot; In Umm al-Fahm, Israel&apos;s second largest Arab town, residents believe the policies aren&apos;t just bad for the Arab minority but for the entire Israeli population. Abu Shakra said he had worked to further dialogue between Jews and Arabs in Israel in Israel for 15 years \u2013 but that the government now seemed intent on making this untenable. &quot;They are looking for ways to provoke conflict, not to create dialogue or equality,&quot; he said. &quot;After 60 years, it is time they embraced the Arab population and understood that if things are not good for Arabs in Israel, they won&apos;t be good for anyone.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-10-19T17:37:52Z", "title": "Israeli-Arabs fear for their future", "sentences": ["ACRI has asked the prime minister to make clear that there are no transfer plans on the negotiating table, and l ast weekend, thousands demonstrated agaisnt the policies in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/19/israeli-arabs-palestinian-state"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "With the olive harvest in full swing across the West Bank, reports are flooding in of settler attacks on Palestinian farmers trying to gather their crops. Acts of arson, sabotage and theft all make for great copy, and rightly so: the atrocities committed by Israeli extremists in the name of nationalism and religion must be condemned. However, focusing solely on the settler violence paints a distorted picture during the two-month-long harvest. At the same time as settler vandals pillage the property of their Palestinian neighbours, hundreds of Israeli volunteers gather in solidarity with the farmers every week to assist them in their work. These selfless individuals cannot single-handedly right the wrongs of the occupation or bring back to life the Palestinians&apos; scorched and uprooted trees, but they can \u2013 and do \u2013 offer a vital alternative to seeing all Israelis as vicious, racist thugs. Organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights (RHR) and Humans without Borders (HWB) tirelessly organise groups of Israelis and internationals to aid the farmers, and in doing so break down suspicion and distrust on both sides of the border. I accompanied a group of HWB volunteers on Friday to see firsthand the way in which Jews and Arabs come together under a banner of peaceful coexistence, and was more heartened by the experience than any other I&apos;ve had in Israel/Palestine in a long time. There was no hidden agenda \u2013 just a simple, stated aim of providing free labour for farmers near Qalqilya who, due to military orders, can&apos;t do an honest day&apos;s work in their own fields. Their olive groves are out of bounds, thanks to the route of the separation wall that bisects their land in typically heartless fashion, and the army would grant only three members of the family permission to cross the fence to access their crops \u2013 far too few to get the job done. Into the breach stepped the HWB group, made up of 20 young Israelis; some native-born, others immigrants from the UK, America and Australia. Meeting at an ungodly hour at Arlozorov train station in Tel Aviv, they had given up their weekend to perform the ultimate mitzvah (commandment): love thy neighbour \u2013 though religion was far from the prime motive for the majority of the volunteers. Instead, their own brand of Zionism \u2013 one which promotes, rather than tramples on, the human rights of all inhabitants of the region \u2013 was the catalyst for their quest. They worked for hours in the scorching heat, completing endless cycles of laying down tarpaulins, raking the fruit free from the sagging branches, bagging up the fallen olives and moving on to the next tree in the line. Despite working alongside the farmer and two of his sons, the focus was on the harvesting rather than turning the day into a mutual love-in between Israelis and Palestinians; such dialogue-heavy events might have their slot in the activist calendar, but this was neither the time nor the place. After all, time is money to the farmers, and getting the olives to market as fast as possible can be the difference between the family business sinking or swimming from one year to the next. As the group sat down to break bread with their Palestinian hosts after six straight hours in the field, the relief was palpable on the farmers&apos; faces; they expressed their gratitude both verbally and via the banquet laid out for the volunteers, recognising the difference the extra hands on deck had made to their task. For the Israelis present, the day was not about proving their self-righteousness to either themselves or others, but rather an opportunity to both remind themselves of the effects of the occupation on ordinary Palestinians as well as to humanise the &quot;unseen other&quot; by way of such everyday interaction. While higher-octane events such as violent anti-wall protests in Bil&apos;in and Nil&apos;in are more attractive to some, seemingly mundane actions such as olive-picking provide far more clement conditions for true peaceful solidarity between the two sides to flourish. For every door that the hilltop hooligans slam shut between Israelis and Palestinians, another one is opened by the likes of RHR and HWB. Their efforts are worth their weight in gold, both for the practical assistance they provide, but also for the opportunities for mutual understanding and discovery that they offer all who participate, Jew and Arab alike. The activists&apos; efforts are as much the true face of Israeli interaction with Palestinian farmers as those of the settlers. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-10-28T09:00:00Z", "title": "The olive groves where peaceful solidarity grows | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Meeting at an ungodly hour at Arlozorov train station in Tel Aviv, they had given up their weekend to perform the ultimate mitzvah (commandment): love thy neighbour \u2013 though religion was far from the prime motive for the majority of the volunteers."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/28/olive-harvest-west-bank-volunteering"}, {"tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Housing benefit", "Communities", "Housing", "Society", "Boris Johnson", "London", "London politics", "Social housing", "Benefits"], "article": "No problem spotting the moral from today&apos;s YouTube story about the Swiss couple who were insulted in a local tongue while renewing their wedding vows in the Maldives: don&apos;t go near a contract in a language you don&apos;t understand. Nearer to home, is our coalition making the same mistake with its package of spending cuts, which seem to be unravelling in lively ways? After all, it&apos;s what overpriced investment bankers did when they chopped up sub-prime debt and sold it on in shiny wrapping paper. When mayor of London Boris Johnson, a media-savvy rascal, uses a disgracefully emotive phrase like &quot;social cleansing&quot; to describe changes to housing benefit changes we can be sure ministers have a problem. As for the abolition of top-rate child benefit, even the FT carries a page one story today about the reform \u2013 small change to the Pink &apos;Un&apos;s readers \u2013 because it threatens husbands with fines if their wives are less than frank about claiming the cash. Teething trouble? Probably, though ministers who want to simplify tax and benefits seem to be busy doing just the opposite. At least FT readers \u2013 cover price \u00a32 a day \u2013 understand these irritating requirements and can afford the loss. Housing benefit reform looks rather trickier. The Guardian is full of alarm again today, alarm more gently reflected in other papers thanks to Boris&apos;s colourful intervention: &quot;We will not accept a kind of Kosovo-style social cleansing of London \u2026 On my watch you are not going to see thousands of families evicted from the place where they have put down roots.&quot; Good for him, says me. Except that using the Kosovo analogy, even when one feels strongly, is impossible to justify. Ken Livingstone, Johnson&apos;s predecessor, committed the same casual gaffe when Tory Wandsworth started decanting its poorer residents to nearby Merton. But the term &quot;cleansing&quot; \u2013 usually &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; \u2013 around the world has come to mean terror and even death. Whatever happens in London as the coalition&apos;s policy unfolds \u2013 or unravels \u2013 it will not be ethnic cleansing. Coalition social housing policy seems to start from a reasonable position. Ministers want to build more affordable homes \u2013 though ex-housing minister Nick Raynsford nailed David Cameron yesterday for misrepresenting Labour&apos;s record \u2013 and need to generate some savings, \u00a32.5bn to be precise, to help pay for it. They have a point, as do their tabloid allies, in suggesting that a system that can pay over \u00a350,000 a year in extreme cases to house families in London is in need of reform. But councils do not fork out such money (they reclaim it from the DWP) just for fun. They have statutory duties towards the homeless and they are administering a scheme which was created by the last Tory government in 1992. In the old days, housing subsidies went into bricks and mortar. Under the 1992 Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act, the subsidies were redirected at people. It was a well-intentioned reform; they usually are. But attempts to reform or at least contain it failed. It cost around \u00a312bn a year by the time Tony Blair came to power, \u00a321bn now. Why so? Do you suppose it has something to do with Britain&apos;s overheated housing market, a prime cause of the credit bubble that helped bring down the banking system that fed it, propped up by Asian savings bearing low interest costs? Yes. China now has the same trouble incidentally, as Japan did before its 90s crash. So reports today that average UK house prices are down \u00a32,376 are good news \u2013 provided they don&apos;t suddenly collapse as they have in many parts of the US. That would cause real trouble. But we are where we are. House prices have been allowed to rise too far, with the result that landlords need to charge more to cover their own costs. The taxpayer has created many multi-millionaire landlords out of housing benefit, and successive governments have tried to cap it. As for councils \u2013 housing associations too \u2013 they are tempted to see both valuable land and stock as a way of easing their own financial problems that coalition cuts are about to make much worse. It is a vicious circle. When Mayor Boris says he doesn&apos;t want to see poor families driven out of London&apos;s richer boroughs, he&apos;s right. The rich \u2013 and the merely comfortably off \u2013 need people to service their needs, from waiters and cleaners to nurses and teachers \u2013 and mixed neighbourhoods are an attractive part of the answer, socially healthy too. Alas, the attractively mixed neighbourhood of one decade rapidly becomes the stiflingly rich and exclusive neighbourhood of the next. Chelsea was for the poor and for bohemians before the second world war. Islington&apos;s lovely 18th and 19th century houses were once run-down and neglected, well into the 1970s. Ditto Notting Hill, where I once lived in Portobello Road \u2013 but fled because I could see what was coming. Watch out, Hackney! In those days, councils and housing associations provided subsidised housing for poorer citizens, gradually driving out slum landlords like Peter Rachman in Notting Hill, one of the villains of the age. The W11 postal district is now so cosmopolitan and chic that most of David Cameron&apos;s so-called &quot;Notting Hill set&quot; actually lives further up the hill in more downmarket W10, Notting Dale and suchlike. I think he did himself until he moved to No 10. That Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant romcom of the same name won&apos;t have helped. Alas, the Thatcher government stopped councils, especially Labour ones, building more and more housing \u2013 admittedly some of it the wrong sort in the wrong places. It also passed the responsibility over to &quot;third arm&quot; non-profit housing associations, deemed to be better run and more responsive, though as they got bigger in consequence of government policy and mergers they became less so. In rich Westminster, Dame Shirley Porter was later found to be decanting poorer tenants to other boroughs to improve Tory prospects of holding marginal wards. Naughty Shirley skulked in Tel Aviv for a number of years. In any case, Thatcher and Michael Heseltine had also begun the process of selling council houses and flats to tenants at spectacular discounts. Much to be said for it too, a rare chance for life-changing social mobility for many, though others got shafted buying duff stuff they couldn&apos;t sell on. It would have been fine if councils were allowed to use the proceeds of those sales to build more homes, even better ones for low-income tenants. But they were blocked there too until recently. In office, Labour made its housing priority rehabilitating older homes, neglected in the tough 80s. So the shortage \u2013 which underpins our overheated UK market \u2013 was further exacerbated. The housing minister, Grant Shapps, tipped by the Daily Mail as the next PM (so that&apos;s him finished) promises transitional money to ease problems and prevent families ending up on the street as an estimated 82,000 such families (17,000 on Whitehall estimates) are eased out of high-rent areas in central London to cheaper neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the capital. Market forces have, of course, been doing this for a long time anyway. On buses and trains, early in the morning and late at night, there are plenty of service industry workers making long journeys to and from home. Whether or not the coalition&apos;s plans to increase their numbers will lower or increase job opportunities seems doubtful. I don&apos;t dispute Shapps&apos;s sincerity; he&apos;s a smart fellow too. He thinks the proposed \u00a3400-per-week cap will push down rents. Well, it might do that too. But the law of unintended consequences sometimes goes its own merry way. If I were David Cameron I&apos;d worry about Boris aligning himself \u2013 yet again \u2013 on the other side of the argument. Who was it who said the mayor has it in him to become Britain&apos;s Berlusconi, the populist chancer with a winning gag for every escapade?

Gili Shem Tov, an openly-gay anchor on one of Israel&apos;s main TV channels, made a female dance partner a condition of competing in the show, which pairs celebrities with professional dancers. Based on the UK&apos;s Strictly Come Dancing, the Israeli show is now in its sixth series. &quot;This is my way of life and this is my agenda, and I wanted to express it,&quot; she told a press conference today at television studios in Newe Ilan, near Jerusalem. &quot;If even just a few people become more tolerant and open-minded as a\u00a0result, then I have achieved something.&quot; Shem Tov, who lives with her partner and their son, said most reaction had been positive, although a few people had said a family programme watched by children should not show two women dancing together. &quot;I don&apos;t understand that,&quot; she said. &quot;I have a child myself.&quot; To her, it was a natural thing to do. Her partner, she said, was proud and excited &quot;and said I have a lot of courage&quot;. Milman, who has appeared in every series of the show, was equally enthusiastic about the debut. &quot;Everyone knows that Israel has a lot of extremes,&quot; she said. &quot;When we go on\u00a0primetime TV as a couple, we&apos;re showing everyone can love everyone. &quot;It&apos;s about respecting the way of life of other people, even if it&apos;s not your way of life.&quot; Milman, who is heterosexual, said the pair had to &quot;change the rules&quot; to make their dance routine work. &quot;In a &apos;normal&apos; couple, the man must show his masculinity and the female is very sensual.&quot; The two women would focus on their &quot;mutualism&quot;, she said, while &quot;still showing the emotions of love and hate, seduction and rejection in the language of movement&quot;. The programme&apos;s makers consulted the BBC, owners of the format, on whether there had been a same-sex couple competing in any of the 36 countries where versions of the show have been broadcast. &quot;They said we would be the first,&quot; said the executive producer, Assaf Gil. There were no ideological objections to a same-sex couple, he said. &quot;We came to the conclusion it would be fascinating and interesting.&quot; Israel has a thriving gay scene, based mostly in the liberal, secular and cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv.

Redacted some 1,500 years ago in the Jewish diaspora&apos;s largest community, on the banks of the Euphrates, the Talmud provided the backbone of Jewish civilization and was a major factor in the survival of this exiled, wandering people. A potpourri of legal discussions, legends, stories, and sundry commentaries on biblical texts, it was the central pillar of Jewish education right up to the modern era. The problem is that much of it is written in a form of demotic Aramaic, a language that the majority of Jews have long ceased to understand, let alone speak \u2013 outside of a small coterie of specialist and mainly rabbinic scholars and their students. Moreover, a proper study of its 24 volumes and 5,700 folio pages takes years. Enter Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a man described by Time magazine as &quot;a mind in a millennium&quot;. An Israeli from a secular home, he was drawn to this esoteric text as a youth and determined to translate it into modern Hebrew. He was 27 when he began the project, now, 45 years later, aged 72, he has completed the last volume of his astounding undertaking. As if to explain the length of the project, he admits &quot;I am a slow writer,&quot; adding parenthetically that he has written another 13 books on Jewish philosophy and law, &quot;on the side&quot;. But it was his work on the Talmud that absorbed most of his waking hours over the past four and half decades. &quot;I was very concerned,&quot; he says, &quot;that there would be no ambiguities in the Hebrew, so I went over it many times.&quot; The result is an elegant, simple Hebrew that any Israeli or other Hebrew speaker will find crystal clear. Translations of some of these texts have also been made in English, French and Russian. Apart from the text itself Rabbi Steinsaltz added explanations, footnotes (on language, history, geography, flora and fauna and other addenda) as well as summaries of legal decisions (halacha) that derive from the discussions in the Talmud itself These expositions upset many of his more cautious, ultra-Orthodox colleagues who publicly excommunicated the work, though not the man himself. Not that his work is meant to be the final word: &quot;Quite the contrary,&quot; he says. &quot;The essence of the Talmud is an ongoing dialectic, it was never meant to be a closed book.&quot; There are wide margins provided for the student to insert his or her own comments. For Steinsaltz, the Babylonian Talmud characterises Judaism, it is &quot;the central column of Jewish civilization,&quot; he declares. But surely, I asked him, it was only studied by a small elite. That, he argues, doesn&apos;t explain its impact. &quot;I was in China,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and I met a professor there. He didn&apos;t know much about Judaism but he was amazed that this small people produced the likes of Marx, Freud and Einstein. I explained to him that though these thinkers were not religious, and indeed were products of the Enlightenment, they carried with them the influence of the Talmud and its thought processes. Each in their own way was looking for one guiding principle which would explain everything. That&apos;s very Talmudic. In fact the idea that there is one principle behind the universe originates with the Jewish people. No one else had this.&quot; Nevertheless it seemed a stretch to say that this multi-volume work has seeped into every Jew&apos;s way of life. He begs to differ. &quot;How many British play football?&quot; he asks rhetorically, before answering his own question: &quot;A tiny percentage. Yet everyone knows that football is part of the British character, part of the essence of who you are if you&apos;re British. Similarly with we Jews. Even if we don&apos;t know Talmud as such, its style of dialectical reasoning, and penetrating questions has come to characterise the Jews as a civilisation.&quot; Was this the reason that Israel was so miserable at football? I asked. He sucks on his pipe and his eyes twinkle over his hirsute face: &quot;The British don&apos;t seem to be doing too well either,&quot; he says, smiling. The celebrations will include a talk by the rabbi which will be broadcasted live via satellite to 245 Jewish communities in 55 countries. In it Rabbi Steinsaltz will encourage studies throughout the Jewish world. &quot;Our main problem today,&quot; he summarises &quot;is survival. And how can we survive without this text?&quot; Beyond the religious community, too, the Steinsaltz Talmud has had a major impact, in Israel and beyond. Dr Ruth Kalderon created two centres \u2013 in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem \u2013 where secular Israelis like herself discuss this book just as they would in a regular yeshiva. &quot;This book changed my life,&quot; says Kalderon unashamedly. &quot;Whatever I learned for my doctorate in Talmud doesn&apos;t compare with the experience of studying Rabbi Steinsaltz&apos;s text. The text is so fresh and alive, it&apos;s as if I am studying directly with him. Because of him a whole generation has been able to access their tradition directly from the source. Many of the hundreds of people that pass through our centres are artists, and many of their works now incorporate images and concepts from the Talmud, something unthinkable 20 years ago. Similarly when I lecture at Israel&apos;s National Film School, for example, and quote texts from the Talmud, it&apos;s no longer considered abnormal. Rabbi Steinsaltz has made this language part of the national discourse.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-11-06T12:00:01Z", "title": "The source of Jewish tradition | Mordechai Beck", "sentences": ["Dr Ruth Kalderon created two centres \u2013 in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem \u2013 where secular Israelis like herself discuss this book just as they would in a regular yeshiva."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/nov/06/babylonian-talmud-translation"}, {"tags": ["Liverpool", "Stuttgart", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "According to the Daily Mail Pepe Reina has &quot;dropped a shock hint&quot; \u2013 perhaps even a shock hint punted gently in his direction during a notably tense Merseyside derby \u2013 that he may be leaving Liverpool in the summer. Asked how long he intended to stay at Anfield, Reina replied &quot;at least until the end of the season&quot;, despite the fact he&apos;s on a six-year contract. He also said he wouldn&apos;t go back to Spain. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is said to be &quot;on red alert&quot;, a condition he presumably conveys by frowning wearily in a long blue padded overcoat and occasionally stroking his chin. Also in The Mail Blackburn, Liverpool and Tottenham are &quot;monitoring&quot; Stuttgart&apos;s Russian international striker Pavel Pogrebnyak, who is 6ft 2in and has scored five goals in seven games, which is apparently good enough these days. Arsenal are going to give a trial to the 16-year-old Israeli midfielder Omri Altman, described as &quot;the new Yossi Benayoun&quot;. Altman plays for Maccabi Tel Aviv and has ambitions to be quite good at West Ham for a year or so, spend five years variously injured or on the bench at assorted bigger clubs and grow a slightly lank floppy fringe. Newcastle and Liverpool are also interested. Saint-Etienne have told Liverpool that their attacking midfielder Dimitri Payet isn&apos;t for sale. Payet, if he were for sale, would cost \u00a37m.

The Daily Mirror reports the news that Ashley Cole has said he &quot;considered leaving Chelsea&quot; over the summer. &quot;There was a time in my head where I thought I needed to leave England,&quot; Cole said yesterday, raising the notion of a separate and entirely localised time zone within his own head, a kind of Ashley Cole-centred universe that The Mill detects \u2013 after extensive gibbering in front of a blackboard in the style employed in American films starring Russell Crowe or some similar great reeking slab of cured ham to denote eccentric genius \u2013 indicates either (a) the existence of parallel universes accessed through the use of a &quot;flux capacitor&quot;; or (b) a case of terminal egomania. The Mill isn&apos;t sure which. Michael Ballack has suggested that Bastian Schweinsteiger should move to Manchester United or Real Madrid in the summer. &quot;He has presence, authority, personality, performance and goals \u2013 he has everything,&quot; Ballack sighed, standing alone in the desert on his vast and trunkless legs of stone and watching a 2002 DVD of Michael Ballack: third best player in the world. &quot;Look on my works ye mighty and despair!&quot; he added, inside his head. Fulham want to sign Luke Young again, perhaps for \u00a32m. Steve Bruce thinks Harry Redknapp will be the next England manager. And Birmingham are still down on their hands and knees clicking their fingers, talking in a high-pitched voice and periodically trying to grab a spitting, clawing Sebastian Larsson roughly round the neck in order to march him inside and make him sign a new contract. Blackburn Rovers are also keen. Swansea midfielder Mark Gower has signed a new one-year contract. And Edgar Davids has finally taken off his sunglasses and had a really good look at West Norwood and the surrounding areas. &quot;I have decided that my journey as a player at Crystal Palace has come to an end,&quot; he announced yesterday. Joey Barton reckons Fabio Capello must pick &quot;Wildman Andy Carroll&quot;. &quot;Hopefully they will stop worrying about the Goody Two Shoes image which the sponsors want for England,&quot; baddy two shoes Barton sighed, bundling a whole raft of issues including assault, drunkenness, more assault and other Things That Are Bad (but the mention of which might give the Mill&apos;s top legal team heebie-jeebies) together under the banner of things that boring people avoid doing simply to suck up to sponsors \u2013 rather than to avoid breaking the law or ruining other people&apos;s lives or due to some basic sense of right and wrong.

He is now in a vegetative state in the respiratory rehabilitation unit in Sheba medical centre, near Tel Aviv. The former hawkish Likud leader \u2013 who went on to form the centrist Kadima party \u2013 will be moved to Sycamore Ranch, his vast farm in the western Negev, not far from the Gaza strip. The ranch, where his wife is buried, was known as the beloved retreat of the man widely despised in the Arab world for his role in the massacres at Sabra and Chatila refugee camps outside Beirut in 1982.

The family and hospital officials have declined to comment on Sharon&apos;s exact condition. Gissin said the former prime minister was breathing independently and not attached to a respirator. However, he added that Sharon occasionally needed an oxygen mask.

Zeev Rotstein, head of Sheba medical centre, will meet the Sharon family tomorrow to &quot;hear their wishes&quot;, a spokesman for the hospital said. &quot;We as a hospital will do everything to help them with their plans,&quot; he said. The centre issued a statement last night saying hospital staff had begun talking to the family about his release almost two years ago. It added that &quot;the preparations for Mr Sharon&apos;s return to his home are being made by his family&quot; but that the hospital would assist. The hospital said it would provide training for private nurses and the other people needed. Doctors who had been treating Sharon would also offer technical and medical assistance if needed.

Iain Duncan Smith says he recognises it in the world of welfare and benefits. He&apos;s on the case. But it applies just as much to the issue of errant diplomats and their tendency, when caught breaking our laws, to claim diplomatic immunity. We know that staff from the Saudi Arabian mission have been suspected of human trafficking and sexual assault. Nigerian diplomatic staff were accused of actual bodily harm, and untouchables from more than 10 different embassies were caught drink-driving. But following confirmation from Hammersmith and Fulham council that a diplomat&apos;s son in London (Brunei, as you ask) escaped a \u00a375 litter fine yesterday by doggedly claiming such immunity, perhaps people will see the current system as the pantomime it is. \u2022 Because for every action, there is a reaction. And it does seem that the parliamentary commissioner&apos;s reporting of the former Labour minister Denis MacShane to the police about his expenses have scuppered the MP&apos;s hopes of replacing Francis Campbell as the UK ambassador to the Holy See. It seemed far-fetched that the Con-Dems would smile on our Denis in any case. An appointment with Insp Knacker appears to settle things. So, who? Nothing definite, but it is said that there is a liking within the Foreign Office for the claims of former Conservative party chairman Michael Ancram. The grandee claimed \u00a398.58 for the cost of repairing his swimming pool boiler, but he did subsequently pay it back. In relative terms, he&apos;s a safe pair of hands. \u2022 On the subject of policing, let&apos;s away to Scotland Yard where Boris Johnson and his acolytes in the capital say they have firm hands on the tiller. And that could be right. Perhaps that&apos;s why the stewardship of the Met is in such crisis. Where to start? Should it be the kettling-of-protesters scandal at last year&apos;s G20 protests? Or the fact of police involvement immediately prior to the death of Ian Tomlinson? Or the criticism by MPs that followed the policing of the demonstration by Tamils last year, by which time, we were told, the lessons about how to police public order events had been learned. Or should it be the latest farrago, the student demo that was allowed to get so out of hand that the foyer of the governing political party was trashed by hotheads? A thought occurs. That last commissioner, Ian Blair. The one Boris got rid of to bring &quot;new leadership&quot;. Was he so bad? \u2022 Yes, it&apos;s two days after the day of shame in central London, and, as the footage of the violence is examined again and again, people react with their different perspectives. It was totally &quot;unacceptable&quot;, says David Cameron from China. The &quot;Hijacking of a very middle class protest&quot;, says the Daily Mail. In academia itself, they have their own take. &quot;Kicking in that window was the hardest work some of my students have done all year,&quot; our man at the lectern said. \u2022 And after the annual squall about the rights and wrongs and &quot;poppy fascism&quot;, the 11th hour arrived. Once again, the nation remembered them. And the silence was particularly welcomed yesterday at the Daily Mail. For this was perhaps the only point when the phones stopped ringing with readers complaining about the unfortunate subject matter in the paper&apos;s Garfield cartoon. &quot;If you squish me, I shall become famous,&quot; said a character, an ant, in the first frame. &quot;They will hold an annual remembrance in my honour, you fat slob,&quot; it said in the second. The third was the best, or the worst, depending on your point of view. &quot;Does anyone here know why we celebrate &apos;National Stupid Day&apos;?&quot; said the text. \u2022 Finally, this is simple.

Sharon, one of the most prominent figures in Israeli history, is currently in a state of &quot;minimal consciousness&quot;, doctors who treated him said. He suffered a stroke in January 2006. &quot;We hope that being at home helps his recuperation, but we don&apos;t expect any dramatic improvement considering his clinical trajectory in the last five years,&quot; Shlomo Noi, the director of rehabilitation at the Sheba medical centre, near Tel Aviv, said. The 82-year-old Sharon has been treated at the centre. &quot;He still needs a ventilator the majority of the time,&quot; Noi added. &quot;The patient responds to sensorial and motor stimulation. Blinking an eye is an example of the responses he is able to emit. His condition can not be described as full unconsciousness.&quot;. Another medical source said that, when Sharon hears music, he sometimes opens one eye. His sons, Omri and Gilad, arrived at the medical centre during the early hours of today. At 6.30am, Sharon was driven from the building in an intensive care ambulance. An hour later, he was at Sycamore Ranch, his farm in the south of Israel not far from the Gaza Strip. The former minister of defence and architect of Israel&apos;s 1982 Lebanon invasion is due to spend 48 hours at the ranch before being returned to hospital. Doctors and relatives will follow the same procedure for three or four weekends. If everything goes well, Sharon will be permanently discharged. Earlier in the week, the Knesset \u2013 the Israeli parliament \u2013 approved 1.6m Israeli shekels (\u00a3272,284) in annual funding for his treatment. The hospital has been trying to convince the former Likud leader&apos;s family to return him home for almost two years. Initially, one medical source suggested there had been family disagreements over how to proceed. Sharon&apos;s sons also feared that their father would not receive the required attention outside the hospital. But this week they decided it was time to take him home once arrangements at the ranch had been finalised. Nurses and paramedic personnel have received the required training. &quot;For months, they&apos;ve been learning how to adjust the ventilator to the patient, how to follow up his kidney function, his urination and his metabolic balance,&quot; Noi said. He refused to comment on how Sharon is fed in order to respect his privacy. Despite being away from public life for five years, Sharon still captures the imagination of ordinary Israelis. &quot;The course of his life is the course of Israeli history,&quot; Ari Shavit, an Israeli columnist who knows the former prime minister, said. &quot;The old Sharon was extreme, but he managed to reinvent himself. He became the incarnation of the new Israeli centre and a bipartisan, and that is why a huge majority of Israelis could identify with him. &quot;Israelis long for Sharon. There is a feeling that there is no proper leadership [now]. He was the last leader who embodied a kind of &apos;fathership&apos;.&quot; However, Israel&apos;s far right is not included in the &quot;huge majority&quot; Shavit refers to. It felt betrayed when Sharon ordered the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, leading some ultra-nationalists to brand his current condition as divine punishment.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-12T14:32:00Z", "title": "Ariel Sharon taken home from Israeli hospital nearly five years after stroke", "sentences": ["&quot;We hope that being at home helps his recuperation, but we don&apos;t expect any dramatic improvement considering his clinical trajectory in the last five years,&quot; Shlomo Noi, the director of rehabilitation at the Sheba medical centre, near Tel Aviv, said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/12/israel-ariel-sharon-taken-home"}, {"tags": ["Middle East peace talks", "Middle East and North Africa", "Hamas", "Israel"], "article": "A senior Israeli intelligence official has warned of the dangers of renewed attacks on Israel by Hamas militants based in the West Bank and a wave of violence from Jewish extremists, both of whom were trying to derail peace negotiations. Security services were concerned about violence from hardline settlers in the West Bank against Palestinians and Israeli security forces, the source said. &quot;This is a big danger. So far it is not terror attacks but we know that it can come very fast to terror attacks.&quot; Settler violence has stepped up over recent months, including attacks on mosques and the destruction of Palestinian olive groves. Some actions against Palestinians have been dubbed &quot;price-tag&quot; operations, in retaliation for the Israeli government&apos;s freeze on settlement construction. A renewed moratorium on building in West Bank settlements, which could be agreed by the Israeli security cabinet this week, and progress in peace talks would provoke further attacks by Jewish extremists, warned the source, whose briefing was on condition of anonymity. At the same time, Hamas was making &quot;big efforts to rebuild its infrastructure in the West Bank to carry out attacks in Israel. This is a very dangerous development we are facing,&quot; he said. According to intelligence gleaned from the interrogation of militants arrested after the shooting of four settlers near Hebron on the eve of the opening of peace talks in Washington in September, Hamas was &quot;planning a wave of very big attacks in Israel in order to foil the peace process&quot;. Israeli intelligence also had evidence that Hamas was behind recent rockets fired from Egypt on the Red Sea resorts of Eilat in Israel and Aqaba in Jordan. The past four years has seen a steep decline in attacks, attributed to the separation barrier built in much of the West Bank, a security crackdown by the Palestinian Authority and doubts among Palestinian militants about the costs of armed struggle. In Gaza, the source said, Hamas was more constrained after the three-week war in 2008-9, although it was making &quot;very big efforts to build up military capabilities&quot; by smuggling weapons from Egypt through tunnels under the southern border of the Gaza Strip. It possesses rockets with a reach of up to 50 miles, capable of hitting Tel Aviv, he said. Egypt should be making more effort to prevent weapons being transported through the tunnels, he said. &quot;Egypt is a sovereign state with a peace agreement with Israel. It is not doing enough to stop the smuggling of weapons. &quot;We can show photos of Egyptian soldiers located less than 20 metres from the opening of a tunnel, and the tunnel is operating under his eyes, under his control, and nobody is doing anything about it. &quot;Egypt could stop all smuggling of weapons in 24 hours if it wanted to, but there is not enough motivation.&quot; He blamed corruption among Egyptian security forces in the Sinai. There was no possibility of reconciliation between Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Fatah, dominant in the West Bank, in the next few years, the source said. &quot;Hamas will not allow Fatah back to the Gaza Strip, Fatah will not allow Hamas back to the West Bank. Even though they share the same Palestinian identity, they are in many aspects two peoples. It will be very hard to unite them into one people and one state. This is one of the biggest problems of the peace process.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-11-15T12:29:53Z", "title": "New wave of violence threatens peace, Israeli official warns", "sentences": ["It possesses rockets with a reach of up to 50 miles, capable of hitting Tel Aviv, he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/15/israel-peace-talks-violence"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Action and adventure", "Gaza flotilla", "Gaza", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Turkey", "Europe"], "article": "He is known as the Turkish James Bond, a seemingly invincible special forces agent who has taken on the country&apos;s enemies time and time again in a series of TV shows and movies.

The latest Alemdar film, titled The Valley of the Wolves \u2013 Palestine, is due to hit cinemas on 28 January. It portrays its hero leading a revenge attack against the Israeli commandos involved in the raid on a flotilla of activists heading for Gaza in May which led to the deaths of nine people. In a trailer for the film, Alemdar is asked what he is doing in Israel. He replies that he is in fact in Palestine.

Turkey says ties cannot return to normal until Israel offers an apology for the attack and provides compensation for its victims. Israel, meanwhile, is concerned that Turkey is moving closer to Iran. The Valley of the Wolves series and films have a cult following in Turkey, but have been sharply criticised at home and abroad for nurturing nationalism, racial hatred and violence. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor declined to comment on the trailer or the forthcoming film yesterday.

Pedro completed the scoring with another excellent finish to give Barcelona the sort of smooth qualification they wanted ahead of Monday&apos;s league clash with Real Madrid.

Roberto Soldado scored twice, while Juan Mata, Aritz Aduriz, Joaquin and Alejandro Dominguez added the rest against a poor Bursaspor side, who scored their first goal of the group in the 68th minute, when Pablo Batalla made it 5-1. The Spaniards, three points behind United, will win the group if they win at Old Trafford on 7 December. &quot;The objective obviously was to qualify for the last 16, but we want to do it as first in the group,&quot; the Valencia coach, Unai Emery, said. &quot;We have the chance to do it in a memorable setting and against a side who beat us here at the Mestalla.

Nezar Hindawi, 56, is a Jordanian serving what is believed to be the longest specified prison term imposed by an English court, having been found guilty of attempting to plant a primed bomb on an El-Al aircraft with 375 people on board flying to Tel Aviv in 1986. He concealed the Semtex explosive in the luggage of his pregnant Irish fiancee, Anne Murphy, without her knowledge, and did not accompany her on to the flight. An Israeli security guard at check-in was suspicious of a pregnant young woman travelling alone and searched her bag. Hindawi became eligible to be considered for parole in 2001 after serving one third of his sentence. However, an application for his case to be reviewed by the parole board was denied by the then home secretary, David Blunkett, and has been the subject of appeals ever since. At the high court today, Hindawi&apos;s counsel, Tim Owen QC, said the decision not to release his client by the then justice secretary, Jack Straw, in November 2009, now adopted by his successor, Ken Clarke, was irrational and unlawful. He told Lord Justice Thomas and Mrs Justice Nicola Davies that the secretary of state had been &quot;implacably opposed&quot; to Hindawi&apos;s release throughout the parole process. He had argued vigorously against release, the court was told, including making written submissions before any evidence had been heard. Following the parole board&apos;s recommendation, he moved from being a party to the process to being the decision-maker, deciding not to release Hindawi for essentially the same reasons as he had advanced before the board, which had comprehensively rejected them. Owen said: &quot;The key issue is to what extent is the secretary of state entirely free to form his own view without in effect giving any weight at all to the views of the parole board. His approach in reality is that he is entirely free to ignore the board and can reach his own view.&quot; despite the fact...that he is not an appropriate decision-maker and lacks the expertise and independence which the parole board has.&quot; Owen told the judges: &quot;The fundamental question is ...what is the secretary of state&apos;s duty when looking at this recommendation? His case is that he attaches whatever weight he chooses, and that if it is none at all, that&apos;s OK. &quot;Our case is that, because of its complexity and the fact it was an oral hearing, this was a decision taken by an independent expert body which should have attracted the very greatest weight.&quot; Hindawi is held at Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire. won the right to a parole hearing after a long legal battle. He first became eligible for parole, after serving one third of his sentence, in April 2001. Evidence at his trial showed that the explosives, concealed in the false bottom of his fiancee&apos;s suitcase, were primed to explode at 39,000 feet over Austria, detonated by a calculator turned into a detonator which had been activated by Hindawi as he accompanied Murphy by taxi to Heathrow. He had told her that he would meet up with her in Israel, where they were to marry. It emerged that Syria was involved in the plot. GCHQ intercepted a message from its embassy in London to Syrian air force intelligence in Damascus. The embassy was also bugged, providing the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, with what he called &quot;conclusive evidence&quot;&apos; of the connection. Damascus at the time was known to be a supporter of terrorist groups. However, Four years later Britain and Syria were friends. Diplomatic relations were broken off but restored in 1990 when Syria joined the coalition against Iraq after the Kuwait invasion. when Syria&apos;s support was needed to beef up the Arab element of the coalition against Saddam Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait, which led to the first Gulf war.

Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 1. (C) Summary: Post hosted two CODELS during the week of May 25: one from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led by Senator Casey, the other from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs led by Congressman Ackerman. Both delegations met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who conveyed similar points on the Peace Process and Israel&apos;s concerns about Iran. End summary. Peace Process ------------- 2. (C) Barak began his meeting with the Casey delegation by apologizing for being late due to what he described as an &quot;internal debate&quot; at the Prime Minister&apos;s office regarding the development of a response to President Obama&apos;s upcoming speech in Cairo. He noted there are &quot;perceived gaps&quot; between the USG and the GOI regarding the Peace Process, and explained the GOI&apos;s internal debate is focused primarily on how to ensure that the U.S. and Israel &quot;trust each other.&quot; Barak expressed confidence that PM Netanyahu is sincere in wanting to &quot;seize this opportunity and move forward&quot; with the Palestinians, but alluded to members of the coalition who do not agree with this course of action. 3. (C) From his perspective, Barak told the Casey delegation that the GOI was in no position to dictate policy to the Palestinians or the USG regarding the Peace Process -- &quot;it takes two to tango, and three to negotiate,&quot; he said. Barak noted that it is the GOI&apos;s responsibility to ensure that &quot;no stone is left unturned&quot; regarding the Peace Process; if efforts to achieve peace ultimately fail, then the GOI must be able to state that every effort was pursued. He said he personally had no objection to &quot;two states for two nations,&quot; and panned Arab arguments for a bi-national state in Israel. Barak said Israel envisions &quot;two peoples living side by side in peace and good neighborliness&quot; as the final goal. 4. (C) With the Ackerman delegation, Barak focused on the need for a regional approach to the peace process. He supports a regional initiative for peace and cooperation for the entire Middle East region to be launched by Israel. He stressed as well the need to build trust and convince the U.S. administration that the new Israeli government is &quot;serious in its efforts toward peace.&quot; 5. (C) Barak commented on political developments in the West Bank and Gaza in both meetings. He said the GOI continues to review its policy, and then added that the Palestinian Authority has much to accomplish in terms of law enforcement, a functioning judiciary, and regaining control of Gaza before a &quot;balanced&quot; Palestinian state can be created. He has been extremely impressed with the work of U.S. Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton training PA security forces, and commended Salam Fayyad&apos;s concrete, practical approach. 6. (C) Barak made clear in these meetings that he feels the Palestinian Authority is weak and lacks self-confidence, and that Gen. Dayton&apos;s training helps bolster confidence. He explained that the GOI had consulted with Egypt and Fatah prior to Operation Cast Lead, asking if they were willing to assume control of Gaza once Israel defeated Hamas. Not surprisingly, Barak said, the GOI received negative answers from both. He stressed the importance of continued consultations with both Egypt and Fatah -- as well as the NGO community -- regarding Gaza reconstruction, and to avoid publicly linking any resolution in Gaza to the release of kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Iran/North Korea ---------------- 7. (C) In his meeting with CODEL Casey, Barak said the GOI believes its &quot;keystone&quot; relations with the USG remain strong. He described the integral role the USG plays in preserving Israel&apos;s Qualitative Military Edge (QME), especially when faced with threats posed by Iran, Hizballah, and Hamas. He noted that the GOI&apos;s positions on Iran are well known, and described North Korea&apos;s recent nuclear test as a &quot;second wake-up call&quot; (the first being the AQ Khan network). Barak asked rhetorically how a lack of firm response to North Korea would be interpreted by Iran&apos;s leadership, speculating the USG would be viewed as a &quot;paper tiger.&quot; 8. (C) In both meetings, Barak said &quot;no option should be removed from the table&quot; when confronting Iran and North Korea; engagement will only work in conjunction with a credible military option, he said. Barak said he was TEL AVIV 00001177 002 OF 002 personally skeptical that engagement would lead to an acceptable resolution, and argued in favor of a paradigm shift to confront the triple threat posed by nuclear proliferation, Islamic extremist terrorism, and rogue/failing states. He said a strategic partnership with China, Russia, India, and the EU is essential in facing these threats. Barak argued that failure to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran would result in a nuclear arms race in the region as Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia look to acquire nuclear weapons. 9. (C) When asked if the USG and GOI have fundamental differences of opinion when assessing Iran&apos;s nuclear program, Barak said we share the same intelligence, but acknowledged differences in analysis. He suggested that the USG view is similar to presenting evidence in a criminal court case in which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. As such, USG standards are tougher -- especially following the failure to find WMD in Iraq -- while end-products such as the 2007 NIE unintentionally take on a softer tone as a result. Barak said the fate of the region and the world rests on our ability to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons -- as such, the standards for determining guilt should be lower as the costs are higher. 10. (C) In both meetings, Barak described Iranians as &quot;chess, not backgammon players.&quot; As such, Iran will attempt to avoid any hook to hang accusations on, and look to Pakistan and North Korea as models to emulate in terms of acquiring nuclear weapons while defying the international community. He doubted Tehran would opt for an open, relatively low-threshold test like the recent one in North Korea. Rather, Iran will seek ways to bypass the NPT while ensuring its program is redundant and well-protected to prevent an irreparable military strike. Barak estimated a window between 6 and 18 months from now in which stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable. After that, he said, any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage. He also expressed concern that should Iran develop nuclear capabilities, other rogue states and/or terrorist groups would not be far behind. Pakistan -------- 11. (C) Barak reinforced his message regarding Pakistan in both meetings. He described Pakistan as his &quot;private nightmare,&quot; suggesting the world might wake up one morning &quot;with everything changed&quot; following a potential Islamic extremist takeover. When asked if the use of force on Iran might backfire with moderate Muslims in Pakistan, thereby exacerbating the situation, Barak acknowledged Iran and Pakistan are interconnected, but disagreed with a causal chain. To the contrary, he argued that if the United States had directly confronted North Korea in recent years, others would be less inclined to pursue nuclear weapons programs. By avoiding confrontation with Iran, Barak argued, the U.S. faces a perception of weakness in the region. 12. (U) CODELS Casey and Ackerman did not have the opportunity to clear this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:13:34Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Ehud Barak sets deadline to resolve Iran nuclear ambitions", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/209599"}, {"tags": ["United Nations", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Uganda", "Rwanda", "Burundi", "World Health Organization", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Burkina Faso", "Chad", "Mali", "Mauritania", "Niger", "Senegal", "Bulgaria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Ban Ki-moon", "Europe", "Africa"], "article": "Washington is running a secret intelligence campaign targeted at the leadership of the United Nations, including the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon and the permanent security council representatives from China, Russia, France and the UK. A classified directive which appears to blur the line between diplomacy and spying was issued to US diplomats under Hillary Clinton&apos;s name in July 2009, demanding forensic technical details about the communications systems used by top UN officials, including passwords and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It called for detailed biometric information &quot;on key UN officials, to include undersecretaries, heads of specialised agencies and their chief advisers, top SYG [secretary general] aides, heads of peace operations and political field missions, including force commanders&quot; as well as intelligence on Ban&apos;s &quot;management and decision-making style and his influence on the secretariat&quot;. A parallel intelligence directive sent to diplomats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi said biometric data included DNA, fingerprints and iris scans. Washington also wanted credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers for UN figures and &quot;biographic and biometric information on UN Security Council permanent representatives&quot;. The secret &quot;national human intelligence collection directive&quot; was sent to US missions at the UN in New York, Vienna and Rome; 33 embassies and consulates, including those in London, Paris and Moscow. The operation targeted at the UN appears to have involved all of Washington&apos;s main intelligence agencies. The CIA&apos;s clandestine service, the US Secret Service and the FBI were included in the &quot;reporting and collection needs&quot; cable alongside the state department under the heading &quot;collection requirements and tasking&quot;. The leak of the directive is likely to spark questions about the legality of the operation and about whether state department diplomats are expected to spy. The level of technical and personal detail demanded about the UN top team&apos;s communication systems could be seen as laying the groundwork for surveillance or hacking operations. It requested &quot;current technical specifications, physical layout and planned upgrades to telecommunications infrastructure and information systems, networks and technologies used by top officials and their support staff&quot;, as well as details on private networks used for official communication, &quot;to include upgrades, security measures, passwords, personal encryption keys and virtual private network versions used&quot;. The UN has previously asserted that bugging the secretary general is illegal, citing the 1946 UN convention on privileges and immunities which states: &quot;The premises of the United Nations shall be inviolable. The property and assets of the United Nations, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action&quot;. The 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which covers the UN, also states that &quot;the official correspondence of the mission shall be inviolable&quot;. The emergence of the directive also risks undermining political trust between the UN leadership and the US, which is the former&apos;s biggest paying member, supplying almost a quarter of its budget \u2013 more than $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) this year. Washington wanted intelligence on the contentious issue of the &quot;relationship or funding between UN personnel and/or missions and terrorist organisations&quot; and links between the UN Relief and Works Agency in the Middle East, and Hamas and Hezbollah. It also wanted to know about plans by UN special rapporteurs to press for potentially embarrassing investigations into the US treatment of detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and &quot;details of friction&quot; between the agencies co-ordinating UN humanitarian operations, evidence of corruption inside UNAids, the joint UN programme on HIV, and in international health organisations, including the World Health Organisation (WHO). It even called for &quot;biographic and biometric&quot; information on Dr Margaret Chan, the director general of WHO, as well as details of her personality, role, effectiveness, management style and influence. The UN is not the only target. The cables reveal that since 2008 the state department has issued at least nine directives to embassies around the world which set forth &quot;a list of priorities intended to guide participating US government agencies as they allocate resources and update plans to collect information&quot;. They are packed with detailed orders and while embassy staff are particularly encouraged to assist in compiling biographic information, the directive on the mineral and oil-rich Great Lakes region of Africa also requested detailed military intelligence, including weapons markings and plans of army bases. A directive on &quot;Palestinian issues&quot; sent to Cairo, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Amman, Damascus and Riyadh demanded the exact travel plans and vehicles used by leading members of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, without explaining why. In one directive that would test the initiative, never mind moral and legal scruples, of any diplomat, Washington ordered staff in the DRC, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to obtain biometric information of leading figures in business, politics, intelligence, military, religion and in key ethnic groups. Fingerprints and photographs are collected as part of embassies&apos; consular and visa operations, but it is harder to see how diplomats could justify obtaining DNA samples and iris scans. Again in central Africa, embassy officials were ordered to gather details about countries&apos; military relations with China, Libya, North Korea, Iran and Russia. Washington assigned high priority to intelligence on the &quot;transfer of strategic materials such as uranium&quot;, and &quot;details of arms acquisitions and arms sales by government or insurgents, including negotiations, contracts, deliveries, terms of sale, quantity and quality of equipment, and price and payment terms&quot;. The directives, signed simply &quot;Clinton&quot; or &quot;Rice&quot;, referring to the current and former secretaries of state, Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, form a central plank of America&apos;s intelligence effort and reveal how Washington is using its 11,500-strong foreign service to glean highly sensitive information on both allies and enemies. They are compliant with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework, which is approved by the president, and issued by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence who oversees the CIA, the Defence Intelligence Agency, FBI and 13 other intelligence agencies. Washington circulated to its Middle Eastern embassies a request for what was effectively a counter-intelligence operation against Mukhabarat, the Palestinian Authority&apos;s secret service, and Istikhbarat, its military intelligence. The directive asked for an assessment of the foreign agencies&apos; &quot;signals intercept capabilities and targets, decryption capabilities, intercept sites and collection hardware, and intercept operation successes&quot; and information of their &quot;efforts to illicitly collect classified, sensitive, commercial proprietary or protected technology information from US companies or government agencies&quot;. Missions in Israel, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt were asked to gather biometric information &quot;on key Palestinian Authority and Hamas leaders and representatives, to include the young guard inside Gaza, the West Bank&quot;, as well as evidence of collusion between the PA security forces and terror groups. Taken together, the directives provide a vivid snapshot of America&apos;s perception of foreign threats which are often dazzlingly interconnected. Paraguayan drug traffickers were suspected of supporting Hezbollah and al-Qaida, while Latin American cocaine barons were linked to criminal networks in the desert states of west Africa, who were in turn linked to Islamist terrorists in the Middle East and Asia. High on the list of requests in an April 2009 directive covering the Saharan west African countries, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, was information about the activities of fighters returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Information was wanted on &quot;indications that international terrorist groups are seeking to take advantage of political, ethnic, tribal or religious conflict&quot;. Diplomats were told to find out about the links between drug traffickers in the region to Latin American cocaine cartels, as well as terrorist or insurgent groups&apos; income derived from the drugs trade. Sometimes the directives appear linked to forthcoming diplomatic obligations of the secretary of state. In a cable to the embassy in Sofia last June, five months before Clinton hosted Bulgaria&apos;s foreign minister in Washington, the first request was about government corruption and the links between organised crime groups and &quot;government and foreign entities, drug and human trafficking, credit card fraud, and computer-related crimes, including child pornography&quot;. Washington also wanted to know about &quot;corruption among senior officials, including off-budget financial flows in support of senior leaders \u2026 details about defence industry, including plans and efforts to co-operate with foreign nations and actors. Weapon system development programmes, firms and facilities. Types, production rates, and factory markings of major weapon systems&quot;. Top tips for dealing with defectors and turncoats One cable offered a detailed and practical guide for embassies on how to handle possible defectors, known as &quot;walk-ins&quot;, who turned up at embassies offering to switch sides. It called for them to be treated with considerable care because they &quot;may be sources of invaluable intelligence&quot;. &quot;Walk-ins may exhibit nervous or anxious behaviour, particularly because access controls and host nation security forces around many of our diplomatic posts make it difficult for walk-ins to approach our facilities discreetly,&quot; it warned. &quot;All briefings should also stress the importance of not drawing attention to the walk-in or alerting host nation security personnel.&quot; Embassy staff should immediately copy the person&apos;s identification papers or passport, in case they got cold feet and ran off, it said. A walk-in who possessed any object that appeared potentially dangerous should be denied access even if the item was presented &quot;as evidence of some intelligence he offers, eg, red mercury [a possibly bogus chemical which has been claimed to be a component of nuclear weapons] presented as proof of plutonium enrichment&quot;.\u2009", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:07Z", "title": "US diplomats spied on UN leadership", "sentences": ["A directive on &quot;Palestinian issues&quot; sent to Cairo, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Amman, Damascus and Riyadh demanded the exact travel plans and vehicles used by leading members of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, without explaining why."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-spying-un"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "Ariel Sharon", "Nuclear weapons", "The Mossad", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)", "European Union", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news"], "article": "Thursday, 17 March 2005, 14:58S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 001593 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 03/14/2015 TAGS PARM, PREL, MNUC, KNNP, EU, IR, IS, GOI EXTERNAL SUBJECT: C-NE4-01083: ISRAELI INTENTIONS REGARDING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMREF: STATE 26053Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 1. (S) SUMMARY: Israel sees Iran as the primary threat to its security and sees the enrichment cycle as the &quot;point of no return&quot; for Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons program. The GOI believes that diplomatic pressure with teeth, such as sanctions, can affect Iranian behavior, and is lobbying the EU-3 and IAEA on details of a permanent suspension agreement. The Israelis support a unified international front but are concerned that the USG may move toward the EU position. Despite the GOI&apos;s focus on the diplomatic track, public and private speculation about possible Israeli air strikes continues. In weighing the military options, the GOI is aware of significant differences from its successful strike against Iraq&apos;s nuclear program in 1981, including an uncertain and dispersed target set, the presence of coalition forces in Iraq and the Gulf, Iranian capabilities to retaliate through Hizballah and terrorism, and the changed strategic environment. END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ---------- The Iranian Threat, &quot;Point of No Return,&quot; and Timelines --------------------------------------------- ---------- 2. (S) PM Sharon calls Iran &quot;the main threat to Israel&quot; and has recently expressed concern that some states are &quot;getting used to&quot; the idea of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. Other senior Israeli officials echo this, cautioning that Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons program poses what Mossad Chief Meir Dagan calls an &quot;existential threat&quot; that alters the strategic balance in the region. 3. (C) In a meeting with congressional visitors in December, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz described operation of the enrichment cycle as the &quot;point of no return&quot; for the Iranian program, a view shared by many senior GOI officials. Mossad Chief Dagan went a step further, saying that the Iranian program will be unstoppable once it no longer requires outside assistance to complete the enrichment process. At the technical level, the director for external affairs at the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) told poloff that the critical step would be Iran&apos;s operation of a centrifuge enrichment cascade. 4. (S) GOI officials have given different timelines for when they believe Iran will have full enrichment capability. In February, PM Sharon told the Secretary that he believes there is still time remaining to pressure Iran, but that the window of opportunity is closing quickly. DefMin Mofaz cautioned that Iran is &quot;less than one year away,&quot; while the head of research in military intelligence estimated that Iran would reach this point by early 2007. Technical experts at the IAEC predicted that Iran would have enrichment capability within six months of the end of the suspension agreement. A few GOI officials admitted informally that these estimates need to be taken with caution. The head of the MFA&apos;s strategic affairs division recalled that GOI assessments from 1993 predicted that Iran would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 at the latest. -------------------------------------------- Focus on Diplomacy and Concern with the EU-3 -------------------------------------------- 5. (S) In the near term, Israel is focused on maintaining diplomatic pressure on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and EU-3. Sharon defines diplomatic pressure to include UNSC sanctions, e.g. on Iran&apos;s airlines and trade, as noted below. President Katsav has said that Tehran is &quot;very conscious of international opinion.&quot; Other MFA and NSC officials point to the current suspension and to Iranian reaction to the Mykonos case as proof that diplomatic pressure can affect decision-making in Tehran. 6. (S) The Israelis often express disappointment with EU-3 efforts, but see no real alternative at this time. PM Sharon told reporters on March 10 that Iran uses the negotiations to &quot;play for time.&quot; In private, Sharon, his Cabinet, and military leaders have all complained that the Europeans are &quot;too soft.&quot; Similarly, President Katsav has cautioned that Iran will &quot;cheat&quot; on any commitments it makes. MFA staff told poloff that they do not believe that the EU-3 effort will be successful in obtaining a permanent suspension or that the Europeans will support effective sanctions against Iran. 7. (C) GOI technical experts said they have been lobbying the Europeans and IAEA on several issues. First, the GOI would like a clearer and more detailed listing of all activities covered by the suspension, along with timelines for each step. Second, they want more robust verification measures and greater focus on Iran&apos;s denial of access to IAEA inspectors. Third, the Israelis insist that any final agreement must be endorsed by the UNSC to ensure that noncompliance will be dealt with at an appropriate level. Fourth, Israel is pushing the EU-3 to define benchmarks that would signal a failure of the process, and to identify the concrete consequences of such failure. 8. (C) According to the IAEC, the GOI has urged the Europeans to examine bilateral or EU sanctions with small, but noticeable, economic impacts. After telling the press on March 10 that &quot;it would probably not be advisable to impose an oil embargo on Iran,&quot; PM Sharon advocated trade and flight restrictions. Lower-level GOI officials said these steps could include restrictions on Iranians studying in Europe, limitations on travel by Iranian scientific personnel, and suspension of landing privileges for Iranian airlines within the EU. The goal, according to the deputy NSA for foreign affairs, is unified pressure from the EU, Russia, and U.S. for a &quot;complete, full, verifiable cessation of the fuel cycle program.&quot; In the short term, this means a full suspension of all enrichment, reprocessing, heavy-water-reactor construction, and related R&amp;D activities. --------------------------------------------- -- Israeli Preference for USG and UNSC Involvement --------------------------------------------- -- 9. (C) In light of their uneasiness with EU-3 efforts, the Israelis are hoping for robust U.S. involvement and action by the UNSC. PM Sharon has urged the EU-3 to continue its efforts, but also stressed the importance of preparing to take Iran to the UNSC. In a meeting with a CoDel on December 12, DefMin Mofaz pushed for the U.S. to take the lead with the Europeans and pursue all diplomatic solutions, including sanctions. President Katsav asked the Secretary not to &quot;wait for the Europeans.&quot; 10. (C) This desire for U.S. activity is amplified by the extremely limited options open to Israel on the diplomatic front. The IAEC&apos;s director for non-proliferation admitted that the GOI sees &quot;little we can do&quot; to increase pressure on Iran as long as Tehran abides by the suspension agreement. The MFA&apos;s office director for the Gulf states said that Israel would maintain its low-profile diplomatic activities, such as supplying IAEA members with intelligence material related to the Iranian program. She said the MFA believes that any overt Israeli pressure would backfire, leading to a surge of Arab support for Iran and focusing attention on Israel&apos;s own nuclear activities. 11. (C) Following the recent announcements on Iran by the President and the Secretary, several Israeli officials asked if the USG is shifting its policy on Iran. The deputy NSA for foreign affairs acknowledged that the U.S. move is probably necessary to build international consensus for taking Iran to the UNSC. At the same time, he expressed concern that the USG would be influenced by what he called the EU&apos;s habit of granting concessions to Iran prior to full compliance. Mid-level staffers at the NSC and IAEC were also disquieted by U.S. press reports claiming that the USG is re-examining its position on Hizballah. ------------------------------------------ The Military Option: Bushehr is not Osirak ------------------------------------------ 12. (S) Despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts, Israeli officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible military options. In public, PM Sharon has stressed the importance of the &quot;political and economic&quot; track. During a recent discussion with a visiting USG official, IDF Deputy Chief of Staff (and CoS-designate) Major General Dani Haloutz similarly said &quot;we don&apos;t want to go there.&quot; In February, President Katsav told the Secretary that &quot;the military option is not necessary -- bring the issue to the Security Council.&quot; 13. (S) Public speculation about possible military strikes usually focuses on the differences from the Israeli Air Force&apos;s attack on Iraq&apos;s Osirak reactor in 1981. In private, GOI officials have acknowledged that several factors would make any attack against Iran a much more difficult mission. A senior military intelligence official told the Embassy that the GOI does not know where all of the targets are located and said that any attack would only delay, not end, the Iranian program. The MFA&apos;s office director for the Gulf states noted that potential target sites are well dispersed throughout the country, with several located in built-up civilian areas. The IAEC stressed the importance of Russian assistance in restraining Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions and said that any attack on Bushehr would likely result in Russian casualties and endanger Moscow&apos;s cooperation. 14. (C) MFA contacts said that the distance to the targets and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and the Gulf raise additional complications. An Israeli assault would necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in Iraq, they maintained, leaving the USG open to retaliation throughout the Islamic world, especially in Iraq. MFA and NSC officials acknowledged that any attack would also elicit a strong response from Arab states and the Palestinians, effectively freezing the peace process. 15. (C) The Israelis realize that Iran would use any military strike as an excuse to cease cooperation with the EU-3 and the IAEA. In addition, the GOI is acutely aware of Iran&apos;s ability to retaliate, both militarily and through attacks by its regional surrogates. PM Sharon has claimed that Hizballah has 11,000 rockets (and possibly UAVs) capable of reaching Israel from launching sites in Lebanon. The MFA&apos;s office director for the Gulf states said that she believed that Iran would retaliate by inciting terrorist groups in Israel and the Occupied Territories. 16. (C) Current USG, EU-3, and IAEA focus on Iran also creates a situation that differs from 1981, when the Israelis felt that the international community was ignoring the Iraqi threat. Israelis hope that the others will solve the Iranian problem for them, or as Vice PM Shimon Peres has said, &quot;I do not think that the matter of Iran needs to be turned into an Israeli problem -- it is a matter of concern for the whole world.&quot; --------------------------------------------- -- Comment: Diplomatic Solution Preferred, but ... --------------------------------------------- -- 17. (S) COMMENT: The Israelis are focusing on diplomatic channels in the IAEA and EU-3, and appear to have very real concerns about the feasibility of military strikes against the Iranian nuclear program. Nevertheless, the GOI has shown time and again that it will act militarily if it believes that its security is threatened, and the IDF is most certainly keeping contingency plans up to date. The Israeli press reported that in February PM Sharon&apos;s Security Cabinet had given &quot;initial authorization&quot; for an attack on Iran. The press reports cited an unnamed &quot;Israeli security source,&quot; who claimed that the USG would &quot;authorize&quot; an Israeli attack. Post notes that it may not be possible to detect preparations for any military strike. Air defense operations would pose nearly perfect cover for civil defense and Air Force activities preceding any attack. Due to both the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the GOI&apos;s near inability to prevent leaks, any attack order would be closely held, probably even from many members of PM Sharon&apos;s Cabinet. 18. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The GOI knows that we share its interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, we should expect continued Israeli lobbying at the highest levels urging the USG to ensure that the EU-3 effort is on track and backed by a solid international front. We will also hear Israeli concerns that the U.S. position may move toward the EU stance. At the same time, we should recognize that Israeli intelligence briefings will understandably focus on worst-case scenarios and may not match current USG assessments. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** KURTZER", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:11Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Israel sees Iran's uranium enrichment as 'point of no return'", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/29037"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The Mossad", "Iran", "Iraq", "Nuclear weapons", "Lebanon", "Saudi Arabia", "Syria", "Sudan", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "Africa"], "article": "Thursday, 17 March 2005, 10:32S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 001580 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 03/15/2010 TAGS PGOV, PREL, KWBG, IR, IS, COUNTERTERRORISM, GOI EXTERNAL SUBJECT: MOSSAD CHIEF TO CODEL CORZINE: SOME FOREIGN FIGHTERS BEGINNING TO LEAVE IRAQClassified By: Pol/C Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer for reasons 1.4(b) an d (d). 1. (S) Summary: Mossad Chief Meir Dagan told CODEL Corzine March 13 that Israeli and U.S. thinking on Iran largely tracks, adding that he believes the EU dialogue with Iran will ultimately fail. Dagan said that Israel has evidence that some foreign fighters have returned home from Iraq, perhaps indicating that the tide may be starting to turn in the U.S. battle against the insurgency there. He worried however, that these militants&apos; countries of origin -- in particular Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria and Sudan -- are ill-equipped to control the returning jihadis, who might then pose a threat to stability in the region and, ultimately, to Israel. End Summary. ---- Iran ---- 2. (C) Senator Jon Corzine, accompanied by Senate staff member Evan Gottesman, the Ambassador, Pol/Res and Poloff (notetaker), met with Mossad Chief Meir Dagan March 13. Acknowledging that there are at times differences in analysis of the facts, Dagan stressed that it is similarities rather than differences that are at the heart of the GOI-U.S. intelligence relationship, particularly on Iran. The facts themselves are not in dispute, Dagan continued, adding that the U.S. and Israeli assessments of Iran&apos;s intentions and plans are largely in accord. Iran has decided to go nuclear, Dagan said, and nothing will stop it. Dagan predicted that the EU dialogue with Iran will not succeed and that the issue of Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions would eventually go to the UN Security Council. ------------------------------------- Iraq - Foreign Fighters Heading Home? ------------------------------------- 3. (S) In response to the Senator&apos;s question, Dagan said that the tide may be starting to turn in Iraq with regard to foreign militant activity. Dagan said Israel has evidence that foreign fighters originating from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Syria and Yemen have arrived back in their home countries, and he assumes that some had returned to Saudi Arabia as well. Dagan predicted that, as with men who fought in Afghanistan during the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s, these returning militants would stay in touch with each other, forming a network based on their common experiences in Iraq. 4. (S) Stressing that Israel has no assets in Iraq other than a friendly relationship with the Kurds, Dagan said that Israel&apos;s interest is more in the impact the jihadis from, for example, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, will have once they return to their countries of origin. Although he predicts Egypt and Jordan will &quot;do all right,&quot; Dagan said he is less confident that governments in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria, and Sudan are sufficiently well-equipped to face down the domestic challenge these returning militants will pose. The combination of their military training and the absence of strong governments willing and able to confront these men could have a devastating impact on Israel by causing chaos in their home countries, he added. Dagan predicted that these jihadis will have less of a direct impact on Palestinians, because Palestinians are already well aware of militant views and opinions via Internet chat rooms. Furthermore, Dagan said he feels that most Palestinians are not searching for &quot;foreign flags,&quot; such as al-Qaeda, under which to rally, because those inclined to do so are already being well-mobilized under existing groups in the West Bank and Gaza. ------- Lebanon ------- 5. (C) Dagan opined that Hizballah will never make the transition to a purely political party in Lebanon, since the organization remains very dependent on its jihadi orientation. Noting that even the recent Hizaballah-sponsored march in Beirut has not deterred the Lebanese from pressing for a full Syrian withdrawal, Dagan advised the U.S. to remain firm in its demand for a complete pullout, and attributed the willingness of the Lebanese people to rise up to U.S. action in Iraq. --------------------------------------------- ------------- Essential to Use All Assets in the Fight Against Terrorism --------------------------------------------- ------------- 6. (C) Dagan said it is essential to combine all types of intelligence assets, rather than relying exclusively on human intelligence or signal intercepts, to counter terrorist threats. Terrorist organizations have been seeking to obtain WMD as a matter of course and, unlike countries that wish to acquire these weapons as a deterrent, non-state actors would be more inclined to actually use them, in Dagan&apos;s opinion. Asked about the relationship between illicit activities such as narcotic or arms trafficking and terrorism, Dagan confirmed that terrorist organizations try to fund their activities by criminal means, adding that credit card fraud and counterfeiting are also methods favored by these groups. Weapons originating from Yemen and Sudan are smuggled into the territories through Egypt for sale, as well as for use by militants, Dagan said. 7. (U) CODEL Corzine did not have an opportunity to clear this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** KURTZER", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:12Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Mossad says US and Israel agree on Iran", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/29006"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Israel", "The Mossad", "Nuclear weapons", "Lebanon", "Gaza", "Syria", "Hamas", "Egypt", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "Africa"], "article": "Wednesday, 18 November 2009, 14:34S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 002502 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 11/18/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PTER, KWBG, EG, IR, SA, LE, IS SUBJECT: 40TH JPMG: NEA REGIONAL DISCUSSION (PART 3 OF 4) Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 1. (S) Summary: As part of the 40th Joint Political Military Group (JPMG), U.S. and GOI counterparts discussed security issues in the Near East region. GOI officials expressed support for the P5 plus 1 engagement process with Iran, but doubted the process would lead to any change in Iranian behavior -- Iran will use the engagement process as an opportunity to continue its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro stressed that engagement with Tehran was not &quot;open ended&quot;; the United States is preparing sanctions in the event engagement does not prove successful. GOI interlocutors continued to express concerns regarding U.S. support of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF); U.S. participants reiterated U.S. support of the LAF as a counterweight to Hizballah. A/S Shapiro noted NEA, with PM participation and support, plans to brief the GOI on the U.S. policy regarding Lebanon in the near future. In a continuation from the JPMG Executive Session, GOI interlocutors made the argument that U.S. arms transfers in the region could potentially arm future enemies of Israel. GOI officials expressed frustration over the Goldstone Report; U.S. officials advocated sharing lessons learned regarding confronting terrorists in civilian-populated areas. GOI officials noted improved counter-smuggling efforts from Egypt regarding arms transfers to Gaza via the Sinai. However, they argued that Egypt can and should do more to prevent the flow of arms. U.S. delegation members also briefed on U.S. policy in Iraq, and expressed concerns about the current situation in Yemen. This is the third of four cables (septels) reporting on the JPMG.

(S) MOD Director General Pinchas Buchris began the plenary, stating this was &quot;perhaps the most important JPMG to date.&quot; He pointed to the threat of a nuclear Iran, and expressed hope that U.S. leadership will find a way to stop Iran. Otherwise, a nuclear-armed Iran will &quot;impact the stability of the world,&quot; Buchris said. A/S Shapiro described this 40th JPMG as a key forum and the primary mechanism in the political-military dialogue between the United States and Israel. He said the United States wants to &quot;re-energize&quot; the JPMG, with the goal to &quot;bring back strategic elements&quot; into the discussion. A/S Shapiro highlighted the importance of mutual understanding and transparent dialogue. Iran ---- 4. (S) MOD Political-Military Director Amos Gilad presented a strategic overview. He began with Iran, reciting President Obama&apos;s statement made during a visit to Israel prior to becoming president that the United States would not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Gilad said Israel concurs, and described current dialogue with Iran as the &quot;most sensitive stage&quot; and Iran&apos;s &quot;last chance.&quot; He said Iran remains determined to TEL AVIV 00002502 002 OF 004 reach the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; which he described as &quot;intolerable.&quot; He quoted former President and Ahmadinejad opponent Rafsanjani as saying Iran &quot;only needs one bomb for Israel,&quot; implying that Iran will continue to threaten Israel regardless of its leadership. 5. (S) A/S Shapiro noted that the United States shares Israel&apos;s concerns that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. He said that the United States is beginning with engagement, but at the same time is preparing tougher measures should engagement fail. A/S Shapiro stressed that engagement was not &quot;open ended&quot; -- the United States needs to see concrete steps and tangible results from the P5 1 talks. He noted concerns over the Qom facility; if Iran does not respond to engagement, then the United States will move toward stronger steps such as sanctions. DASD Kahl reiterated that it is not our intention to allow Iran to &quot;run out the clock,&quot; and noted that engagement also serves to build international consensus on sanctions. MFA Deputy Director for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar argued that the United States must present a clearer message to the Europeans on what is expected of them regarding sanctions. 6. (S) A representative from Mossad said Tehran understands that by reacting positively to engagement, Iran can continue to &quot;play for time&quot; and avoid sanctions while pursuing its strategic objective to obtain a military nuclear capability. From Mossad&apos;s perspective, there is no reason to believe Iran will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 2010-2011, Iran will have the technological capability to build a nuclear weapon -- essentially reducing the question of weaponizing to a political decision. Mossad said Iran&apos;s main crisis is in the political sphere -- the current regime is weaker than prior to the elections, but does not face significant risk as its security apparatus remains loyal, while the opposition lacks a charismatic leader. The goal of the regime, therefore, is to calm down the domestic political environment -- Khamenei realizes the frustration demonstrated following the elections has not disappeared. BG Smith asked if Khamenei&apos;s death might change the political landscape; Mossad noted no information to suggest a change in Khamenei&apos;s health, while those surrounding him appear more loyal than ever. 7. (S) Mossad believes Iran wants to become a regional hegemon, and is dictating its agenda by using Hamas and Hizballah as force multipliers. In that respect, Iran is very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to its proxies. Mossad said Tehran also understands the effort to split Syria from Iran&apos;s influence, and is working hard to deepen its relationship with Syria as a result. DASD Kahl argued that Iran is weaker regionally today than in recent years. He noted progress in Iraq, the results of the recent Lebanese elections, and outreach to Syria as signs of a weaker Iran. DASD Kahl also noted increased U.S. credibility in the Muslim world, while the crackdown following the Iranian elections exposed the current regime as brutal to the region and in Europe. Hizballah/Lebanon/Syria ----------------------- 8. (S) Gilad addressed threats posed by &quot;Hizballahstan&quot; and &quot;Hamastan,&quot; noting that Hizballah/Hamas-Syria-Iran cooperation has strengthened. He noted that rockets from Lebanon can now cover the entire territory of Israel, while ballistic missiles -- although not new -- remain Israel&apos;s most serious threat with adversaries having the capability to target Israeli citizens and major cities. IDF J5 Col Shimon Arad noted four main trends in Lebanon: 1) internal political deadlock since the elections; 2) Hizballah&apos;s growing military capabilities; 3) Lebanon as a volatile military arena; and 4) Lebanon&apos;s susceptibility to outside influences, including Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. He recommended improved US.-Israel coordination, and called for an exchange of views. Arad also recommended creating Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) deconfliction measures, demanding improved LAF performance, and exerting greater pressure on Syria and smuggling. Finally, he called for sanctions on the Iranian Republican Guard Corps (IRGC), trilateral meetings with the Lebanese and UNIFIL to deter Hizballah, and bolstering UNIFIL by extending Gen. Graziano&apos;s tour for an additional six months. 9. (S) A/S Shapiro acknowledged the GOI&apos;s desire for specifics regarding U.S. policy on Lebanon, and hoped to invite GOI representatives to Washington in the near future for a full brief led by NEA, with PM participation and support. He cited the need to provide an alternative to Hizballah, which explains U.S. goals to strengthen the LAF as a counterweight. DASD Kahl argued that any LAF cooperation TEL AVIV 00002502 003 OF 004 with Hizballah is pragmatic given the LAF&apos;s current weakness. He noted that U.S. assistance has been temporarily put on hold since there is still no Lebanese government. Kahl also argued that prospects for better relations with Damascus depend on Syrian desires for better relations with the United States and the return of the Golan Heights. Arad argued that more must be done to weaken radicals and cease smuggling. Gilad said the GOI cannot envision a government in Lebanon without Hizballah, and said the LAF will come to the defense of Hizballah if attacked by Israel -- thus, a strengthened LAF hurts Israel. QME --- 10. (S) Turning to U.S. regional arms transfers, Gilad suggested Qualitative Military Edge (QME) as a &quot;codename&quot; for potential threats against Israel. Israel currently enjoys peace with regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates -- but the future is uncertain, and each of these regimes faces the potential for change, he argued. U.S. weapons -- &quot;the best in the world&quot; -- level the playing field by reducing the need for training -- and could ultimately aid a future enemy of Israel, Gilad said. A/S Shapiro stressed the importance of transparency -- while there may be differences between Israel and the United States in terms of a regional assessment, the key is to ensure that there are no surprises, he said. Peace Process ------------- 11. (S) Gilad described the Middle East peace process as a &quot;pillar&quot; of Israeli security. He quoted PM Netanyahu and President Peres that Israel remains sincerely committed to peace. Gilad noted however, that the re-launching of negotiations is complicated by the split in Palestinian leadership. He said a weak and corrupt PA had lost Gaza despite Israeli warnings. Gilad said 2010 will prove pivotal with Palestinian elections looming and Egyptian mediation efforts to broker reconciliation between Hamas and the PA having failed. That said, he noted that Israeli-PA security and economic cooperation in the West Bank continues to improve as Jenin and Nablus flourish, and described Palestinian security forces as the &quot;good guys.&quot; NEA/IPA Director Tom Goldberger said Special Envoy Sen. Mitchell continues his mission, and noted that Egyptian reconciliation efforts were meant to strengthen the PA, not weaken it. Goldstone Report ---------------- 12. (S) Gilad addressed Israel&apos;s immediate neighbors within the context of the Goldstone Report. He said Israel has checked &quot;all the details&quot; of the report, and have concluded that the report&apos;s accusations are &quot;baseless.&quot; Buchris said the report sets a bad precedent for countries trying to protect its citizens from terrorists; he noted 300,000 phone calls from the IDF to houses in Gaza ahead of strikes in the effort to prevent civilian casualties -- &quot;no other country has taken such steps,&quot; Buchris argued. A/S Shapiro highlighted strong U.S. opposition to the report&apos;s referral to the UN Security Council, noting the report&apos;s biased mandate. 13. (S) Gilad said Israel only entered Gaza after Hamas violated the ceasefire or &quot;tahdiya,&quot; which many Israelis felt was &quot;humiliating&quot; and left Defense Minister Barak open to criticism. Gilad characterized Operation Cast Lead as a success that accounted for humanitarian issues; the IDF showed restraint in the operation because Israel did not want to re-occupy Gaza. DASD Kahl advocated sharing perspectives and lessons learned on strategic communication to more effectively confront terrorists in civilian-populated areas. NSC Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Prem Kumar noted continued UNSC interest in the Goldstone Report, and asked Israel to inform the United States on any additional efforts or investigations the GOI was taking to help deflect any further damage from the report. Egypt/Counter-Smuggling ----------------------- 14. (S) Gilad said Israel was frustrated by its Arab neighbors -- including specifically Egypt -- for supporting the Goldstone Report, which complicates the peace process. Israel continues to benefit from good security cooperation with Jordan, he said. Gilad argued that Egypt could stop smuggling into Gaza &quot;completely,&quot; and questioned whether Egypt should be judged by its efforts or results. Gilad TEL AVIV 00002502 004 OF 004 stressed the latter, and argued Egypt can do more on counter-smuggling. Finally, he noted Israeli concerns that Egypt continues to prepare for a potential future military confrontation with Israel, while no Egyptian military officers visit Israel. 15. (S) A/S Shapiro outlined U.S. military assistance to strengthen Egyptian border security, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and civil defense efforts. He said the United States is working with Egypt to improve regional security efforts, such as counter-smuggling. Regarding the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, A/S Shapiro stressed efforts to improve energy security and counter-terrorism, while bolstering the capabilities of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the face of the Iranian threat. Finally, he noted U.S. withdrawal from the Anatolian Eagle exercise following the Turkish decision to suspend the IDF&apos;s participation. A/S Shapiro said the United States has been delivering the message that Turkey must improve its relationship with Israel. 16. (S) PM Counter-Piracy Coordinator Maggi briefed on the counter smuggling technical discussion meeting (septel). He cited the importance of working with Israel&apos;s neighbors -- including especially Egypt and Turkey -- to prevent Iranian weapons from entering Gaza. Maggi said more pressure should be applied in the EU and UN to gain more latitude -- and possibly further action from the EU. He said tracking cash flows, and increasing prosecutions and incarcerations were important, with the ultimate goal of increasing cooperation and momentum. Goldberger said Egypt sees Hamas as a national security threat, and added that Egypt had closed 200 tunnels since the beginning of 2009. 17. (S) Goldberger noted Egyptian domestic political sensitivities, and questioned whether more commercial and humanitarian goods could be allowed through the Gaza border crossings. Gilad strongly stated that there were no limits on commercial goods through the border crossings. Goldberger asked about construction materiel like cement; Gilad said the GOI would not allow Hamas to build bunkers -- goods such as cement or iron would not be allowed because of their military applications. He also argued that smuggling is a lucrative business for all involved, including the Egyptian government, and said the best way to stop the smuggling was to increase arrests and incarcerations. Goldberger mentioned U.S. economic and development assistance efforts in Sinai. He noted that most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on Israeli intelligence; additional information/intelligence from the GOI would ensure greater cooperation. Bar raised prosecuting shipping companies complicit in arms transfers to Gaza; A/S Shapiro said he would take that back to Washington for further consideration. Iraq/Yemen ---------- 18. (S) On Iraq, DASD Kahl noted there are currently 125,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq, which will be reduced to 50,000 soldiers by September 1, 2010 with complete U.S. troop withdrawal by the end of 2011. He noted the U.S. goal of establishing a long-term strategic relationship with a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq. A/S Shapiro and DASD Kahl briefed the GOI on U.S. efforts to assist the Iraqi military to complete its counterinsurgency force, transition the military to a force that can defend its borders, and align the Iraqi military more closely to the United States. 19. (S) DASD Kahl pointed to the growing threat (al Qaida, al Houthi insurgency, and southern secessionists) in Yemen. He said the United States is attempting to prevent Yemen from heading toward an &quot;Afghanistan-type scenario&quot; with general lawlessness and increased ungoverned spaces. BG Smith noted that al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) continues to fester in North and sub-Saharan Africa. He said Egypt is actively involved in countering AQIM with 3,800 soldiers in Sudan -- this should be encouraged and expanded. 20. (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared on this cable.

Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 1. (S) Summary: Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro met with a number of GOI officials on July 22-23 to stress the importance of the U.S.-Israeli political-military relationship, and to discuss among other issues Israel&apos;s Qualitative Military Edge (QME). GOI interlocutors continued to press for the opportunity to review the QME report prior to its submission to Congress, and presented an official response to a U.S. non-paper on potential arms transfers to Arab countries. In that respect, the MOD proposed technical discussions in Washington on August 3 to further discuss GOI concerns over the potential F-15SA transfer to Saudi Arabia. GOI officials continued to express reservations regarding U.S. arms transfers to Lebanon, and requested the opportunity to further discuss U.S. strategy and intentions with respect to the Lebanese Armed Forces. GOI interlocutors raised continued concerns over the Iranian nuclear weapons program, noting that any policy of engagement be done in conjunction with tougher sanctions and for a finite period of time before turning to other &quot;options on the table.&quot; Other issues raised by GOI officials included the Peace Process, Israel&apos;s export control system, and potential Israeli exports to China. Both sides agreed in principle to the next session of the Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) in October or early November in Israel. End summary. 2. (SBU) On July 22, A/S Shapiro met with MOD Director General Pinchas Buchris, MOD Political-Military Director Amos Gilad, Defense Export Control Directorate Chief Eli Pincu, and participated in a roundtable discussion led by J5 Strategic Division Chief Brigadier General Yossi Heymann. At the MFA on July 23, A/S Shapiro met with Director General Yossi Gal and participated in a roundtable discussion led by Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar and Export Control Director Roey Gilad. A/S Shapiro also participated in a strategic tour of Israel, and visited Israeli defense company Plasan-Sasa. U.S.-Israeli Relationship ------------------------- 3. (SBU) A/S Shapiro stressed the importance of the U.S-Israeli political-military relationship, noting the significance of visiting Israel on his first overseas trip in his capacity as Assistant Secretary for the Political-Military Affairs Bureau. GOI interlocutors appreciated the opportunity to resume dialogue on this important aspect of the U.S.-Israeli relationship. MOD DG Buchris noted the two still relatively new administrations in the United States and Israel, and the importance of limiting the number of misunderstandings in the future. Qualitative Military Edge ------------------------- 4. (S) GOI officials reiterated the importance of maintaining Israel&apos;s Qualitative Military Edge (QME). They said that Israel understands U.S. policy intentions to arm moderate Arab states in the region to counter the Iranian threat, and prefers such sales originate from the United States instead of other countries like Russia or China. However, Israel continues to stress the importance of identifying potential risks that may become future threats or adversaries, and for this reason maintains several objections as indicated in the official GOI response to the QME non-paper on potential U.S. arms sales to the region (ref e-mail to PM/RSAT separately). 5. (S) GOI officials also expressed continued interest in reviewing the QME report prior to its submission to Congress. A/S Shapiro reiterated that the report was based on an assessment from the intelligence community, and therefore not releasable to the GOI. He referenced previous points made to the Israeli embassy in Washington regarding the report, and welcomed any comments the GOI might have -- although such comments should be delivered as soon as possible as the report is already overdue. Israeli interlocutors appreciated the classified nature of the report, but also made clear it was difficult to comment on the report&apos;s results without reviewing its content or intelligence assessment. In that respect, Buchris and other GOI officials requested that the QME process be reviewed in light of future QME reports. 6. (S) GOI interlocutors attempted to make the argument that moderate Arab countries could in the future become adversaries -- and that this should be taken into account in the QME process. During a roundtable discussion led by the MFA&apos;s Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar, the MFA&apos;s Center for Policy Research gave intelligence briefs on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon to further support the argument that these countries could become future foes. Policy Research Center interlocutors reviewed succession concerns in both Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Bar argued that a perceived closure in the capability gap between Israel and Arab states, coupled with a nuclear-armed Iran, could compel moderate Arab states to reassess the notion that Israel was a fixture in the region. 7. (S) Typically frank, MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad was not certain how much longer Egyptian President Mubarak would live, and questioned whether his son Gamal was ready to assume command. Gilad said the Egyptian military led by Defense Minister Tantawi continues to train and exercise as if &quot;Israel was its only enemy.&quot; He added that there were disturbing signs on the Egyptian streets, as women are dressed more conservatively, and that peace with Israel &quot;is too thin, too superficial.&quot; On Saudi Arabia, Gilad said that King Abdullah does not hate Israel, but his chief priority is the survival of the regime. 8. (S) The GOI official response to the arms transfer non-paper includes several objections, such as the potential transfer of systems for the F-15SA to Saudi Arabia, including the Enhanced Paveway II, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, and AESA radar. Buchris said the GOI is ready to establish a working group to discuss the F-15SA transfer, and proposed an Israeli technical team accompany BG Heymann to Washington (in town for a missile defense meeting) on August 3 to discuss the issue further. Buchris said the sale of the F-15SA was not the problem, but rather the weapons systems included on the planes and the location of the planes in Saudi Arabia. Lebanon ------- 9. (S) The GOI remains concerned about U.S. arms transfers to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), and has requested the opportunity to discuss further U.S. intentions regarding the LAF. A/S Shapiro said the results of the Lebanese elections represented a turning point, and rejection of Hizballah and its Iranian sponsors. The need to build up Lebanese institutions, including the army, was now more important than ever, he argued. A/S Shapiro said the LAF has thus far demonstrated a solid record of accounting for U.S. systems transferred to Lebanon. 10. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the elections in Lebanon were positive, but countered that Hizballah&apos;s influence remains strong. He argued that items such as the Cessna Caravan and the Raven unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) lack sufficient mitigation measures, which creates the potential for an incident along the Israel-Lebanese border. Amos Gilad said the GOI does not believe the LAF will attack Israel. However, given the ties between Hizballah and the LAF, he was certain the IDF would eventually face the LAF in any conflict with Hizballah. 11. (S) Analysts from the MFA&apos;s Center for Policy Research argued there has been no dramatic change in the political arena despite the March 14 coalition&apos;s significant victory in the elections. They said the fragile political situation in Lebanon is currently stable, but Hizballah still possesses an unofficial veto over policy. Long term prospects will be tested by the Hariri Tribunal and Hizballah&apos;s desire for a reprisal to the 2008 Mughniyeh assassination. MFA Policy Research analysts further argued that the LAF faces tremendous pressure following the recent explosion of a Hizballah arms cache near the Lebanese-Israeli border. MFA DG Yossi Gal noted that UNIFIL had been prevented from investigating the explosion, and raised the recent crossing by Lebanese citizens into Israeli territory to plant Lebanese and Hizballah flags. He said French and Italian delegations had praised the GOI&apos;s restraint in these cases. 12. (S) A/S Shapiro asked if the election results might be the result in part of a backlash in the Christian community against Hizballah; the Policy Research analysts countered that the results were indicative of several factors, including the influx of Saudi money and an unstable opposition camp. They agreed that Hizballah leader Nasrallah might be a bit chastened following the elections, as suggested by A/S Shapiro, but that Hizballah continues to try and undermine the March 14 coalition. 13. (S) During the MOD roundtable discussion, BG Heymann also acknowledged the positive results of the elections. However, he feared the outcome did not represent the real power of the Shi&apos;ites in Lebanon. He agreed that moderates and the LAF must be strengthened, but expressed deep concerns about ongoing cooperation between Hizballah and the LAF. He also said that such aid to Lebanon be paired with efforts to halt smuggling and directly weaken Hizballah. 14. (S) BG Heymann also cited concerns regarding mitigation measures for the Caravan and Raven in order to prevent an &quot;accidental engagement&quot; by the IAF. Overall, he was skeptical that these systems would benefit the LAF, and said the GOI would appreciate a more in-depth conversation regarding U.S. intentions and overarching strategy with respect to the LAF. Heymann suggested further talks to coincide with the August 3rd F-15 technical discussion in Washington; MFA DDG Bar echoed this request. A/S Shapiro offered to take that back to Washington for review. If it proved too difficult on short notice to bring together interagency experts to discuss US intentions with the LAF, A/S Shapiro suggested it be included in the Joint Political Military Group talks later in the fall. Iran ---- 15. (S) Iran&apos;s pursuit of nuclear weapons remains the GOI&apos;s primary focus. Buchris stated bluntly that it was not clear to him where U.S. policy was heading with regard to Iran. In separate meetings, Buchris and Amos Gilad said that Israel&apos;s preeminent priority is to prevent Iran&apos;s nuclear weapons program, which if realized would cause a nuclear arms race across the Middle East as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt pursue similar programs in response. Gilad was skeptical that engagement would work, noting Iranian desires to &quot;establish a new empire&quot; and pointing to Iranian support for Hizballah and &quot;Hamastan.&quot; Buchris added that the United States&apos; desire to engage with Iran should be accompanied by tough sanctions, and only pursued for a finite period of time; MFA DG Gal concurred. Alluding to a potential military strike, Buchris said &quot;all options must remain on the table,&quot; and acknowledged that part of his job was insuring Israel was ready to employ such an option, no matter how undesirable it may be. 16. (S) A/S Shapiro made clear that a nuclear armed Iran was unacceptable to the United States. He referenced Secretary Clinton&apos;s July 15 foreign policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations, noting the offer of engagement with Iran -- but reinforcing that such an offer is not indefinite. A/S Shapiro argued that an Iranian rejection of our offer to engage will only help bolster international support for increased sanctions. He also pointed to the uncertain situation following the Iranian elections -- it was unclear at this point how the regime in Tehran will react to our offer of engagement. That said, he repeated that the engagement offer was not unlimited, noting that the United States will reassess its engagement strategy with Iran later this fall. 17. (S) A/S Shapiro cited a commonality of interests with the Gulf States, which also view Iran as the preeminent threat -- we should take advantage of this commonality, he said. During the J5 roundtable discussion, IDF interlocutors expressed skepticism that proposed military assistance to the Gulf would help against Iran, as some of the systems slated for delivery are not designed to counter the threats, nuclear and asymmetrical, posed by Iran. A/S Shapiro agreed that assistance to Gulf states should not diminish Israel&apos;s QME, but argued that it sends a signal to those countries (as well as Iran) that they have strong allies in the West. It also helps convince these regimes that their best interests lie with the moderate camp rather than with Iran. 18. (S) Buchris said the lack of an appointed U.S. special envoy focusing on Iran suggested the United States did not believe Iran was a priority. A/S Shapiro reassured Buchris that Iran was a top priority as President Obama and Secretary Clinton are intensely focused on Iran. The fact that Tehran has not responded to our offer of engagement makes a special envoy responsible for negotiations not as important, A/S Shapiro said -- in any case, much of the discussion will be behind the scenes. 19. (S) Buchris referenced a press report from Secretary Clinton&apos;s trip to Jakarta in which she said the United States would consider providing a defense umbrella for moderate Arab countries in the Middle East should Iran acquire a nuclear weapon. Buchris argued that such a statement already conceded the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran. MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar also raised the Secretary&apos;s Jakarta statement; A/S Shapiro stated that the Secretary&apos;s comments did not indicate a new policy approach, but were meant as a deterrent factor toward Iran&apos;s nuclear weapons ambitions -- not as a concession -- and that journalists covering the trip attempted to make more out of the statement than was intended. 20. (S) Amos Gilad referenced Russia&apos;s potential sale of the S-300 missile system to Iran, noting that Russian interlocutors initially denied the S-300 contract with Iran, and then later admitted it had been signed but added that the system would not be delivered for political reasons. However, Gilad said the Russians would reassess this political calculation should the United States continue to pursue missile defense plans in Poland and the Czech Republic. He speculated that the Iranians would continue to put pressure on Russia to sell the system rather than pursue alternative Chinese systems. He said the Russians appear committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but he personally had doubts about their intelligence capabilities following their lack of knowledge regarding the Syrian nuclear project. Peace Process ------------- 21. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority was doing a &quot;good job&quot; in the West Bank, noting respect for Palestinian Security Forces (PASF) as they take more control of security -- giving them the chance to succeed was important, Buchris said. He also commended the work of United States Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton in training the PASF. That said, Buchris argued the way ahead would be difficult, given the divide between Hamas and Fatah. Reconciliation talks between the two have stalled -- Amos Gilad said both sides are &quot;more interested in swallowing one another&quot; than negotiating. Behind the scenes discussions with Hamas by European countries and even U.S. visitors have not helped the situation, Buchris said. A/S Shapiro deferred to Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell&apos;s efforts, but noted Secretary Clinton&apos;s point that a stronger PA will offer an alternative to Hamas. He also stressed Secretary Clinton&apos;s remarks during her July 15 speech that the United States will not engage with Hamas unless it has accepted the Quartet principles. Export Control -------------- 22. (C) MOD Defense Export Control Directorate (DECD) Chief Eli Pincu reviewed the export control system, emphasizing an improved process, but also acknowledging the potential for improvement. He gave a brief presentation regarding Israeli export controls, including enhanced legislation, cross-ministry coordination, enhanced enforcement, and increased industry outreach and training. He noted 780 registered exporters in Israel; for 2009, 31,373 marketing licenses had thus far been issued, with 1,198 denials and 219 returned without action. MFA Export Control Director Roey Gilad stressed the partnership between the MOD and MFA on export licenses, and explained the system&apos;s dispute resolution mechanism in the event the MFA and MOD disagree on a particular case. 23. (C) Both Pincu and Roey Gilad noted that the GOI continues to seek assistance in closing export control loopholes, including brokering. Pincu noted that brokering had been included in the Defense Export Control Act, but that accompanying implementation legislation had not yet entered in to force. Pincu said the GOI had consulted with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan on its brokering laws, and planned to raise it during the annual defense export control working group to be held in Washington in October. Roey Gilad and other DECD officials also hope to travel to Washington in the near future to further discuss brokering issues. China ----- 24. (C) MFA Export Control Director Roey Gilad reiterated that the GOI in no way desires to compromise U.S. national interests with respect to exports to China. He noted, however, that the U.S. Department of Commerce created in 2007 a list of exemptions for certain items if sent to validated end users in China. Gilad questioned whether the same exemptions might be possible for Israel. As it currently stands, the GOI must pursue any export to China through the bilateral statement of understanding with the United States. While the statement calls for expeditious resolution of any requests to export to China, it often takes up to 80 days to obtain approval. By that time, Gilad said, China has often found the item through another supplier. Moreover, the Israeli export control system requires a 20-working day turn-around on all export license requests -- which is not possible, given the length of time required to obtain an answer from the United States. A/S Shapiro offered to raise the issue in Washington. JPMG ---- 25. (SBU) A/S Shapiro suggested the next session of the Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) convene shortly after the Jewish holidays, most likely in October or early November. GOI officials agreed in principle, and will look at the calendar and propose dates. 26. (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared this cable. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:39Z", "title": "US embassy cables: US pressed to maintain Israel's 'qualitative military edge'", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/218775"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Barack Obama", "Israel", "The Mossad", "Nuclear weapons", "US news", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US national security", "US foreign policy", "The US embassy cables"], "article": "Wednesday, 10 December 2008, 08:10S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 002760 SIPDIS TREASURY FOR LEVEY, S. ATHENS FOR PURCELL, A. EO 12958 DECL: 12/10/2018 TAGS KTFN, EFIN, ECON, KWBG, IR, IS SUBJECT: U/S LEVEY REASSURES GOI THAT NO MOMENTUM WILL BE LOST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR FINANCEClassified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) ------- SUMMARY ------- 1.(S) In a visit to Israel on 16-17 November, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Stuart A. Levey, reassured GOI officials that no momentum would be lost in USG efforts to combat terrorist financing or to pressure Iran during the transition to a new US administration in January. In meetings with Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, Mossad Director Meir Dagan, National Security Council Chairman Dani Arditi, and others, U/S Levey emphasized recent U.S. designations against the Union of Good, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and the recent revocation of Iran&apos;s &quot;U-Turn&quot; license. In response to GOI officials&apos; pressure to have the U.S. designate the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Levey underscored the importance of international, multilateral concurrence for such an effort to be a success. 2.(S) Israeli officials were keen to outline an &quot;escalation&quot; in CBI programs that they believed pose a danger to the international financial system. Several key Israeli officials identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI, as a key figure in masterminding new ways to help the Iranian commercial and banking sectors circumvent sanctions. Levey promised to continue pushing the Gulf states on adopting stronger regulation until the last day of his appointment. 3.(S) Mossad Chief Meir Dagan informed Levey that sanctions were beginning to have a negative effect on Iran&apos;s regime. NSC Chairman Arditi also told him that the PA was performing well in its renewed fight against terror finance in the West Bank. END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ----- GOI CONCERNED ABOUT COUNTER TERROR FINANCE POLICY CONTINUITY --------------------------------------------- ----- 4.(S) National Security Council (NCS) Chairman, Dani Arditi, in a November 16 meeting with U/S Stuart Levey, asked whether Levey thought his efforts would continue into the next U.S. administration. Even though he said he planned to resign as required in January, Levey told Arditi that he believed the Obama team would be committed to continuing the ambitious program against terrorism finance that he has shepherded over the last several years. Saying counter- terrorism finance was not a partisan issue in the U.S., Levey subsequently confirmed these sentiments to Foreign Minister (FM) Tzipi Livni and Mossad Director Meir Dagan in separate meetings that occurred on the following day, November 17. ---------------------- IRAN/NON-PROLIFERATION ---------------------- 5.(S) On November 16, Levey outlined for Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar, and Senior Deputy Director General Yossi Gal positive developments in the Iran effort. He told them that Treasury had been very successful in curtailing business with Iran by most &quot;major players&quot;. Levey said that expanding the non-proliferation strategy into insurance, and putting pressure on Iran&apos;s oil refining capacity and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) industry were next steps being pursued. He also reported that the recent IRISL designation has been unusually effective. CBI&apos;s Reza Raei Masterminds New Methods --------------------------------------- 6.(S) During their November 16 meeting, Arditi told Levey that the Israeli intelligence community has continued to see an escalation in CBI efforts to help designated Iranian commercial banks circumvent international and U.S. sanctions. The NSC Chairman presented several recent examples of CBI behavior that he characterized as unusual for a central bank. Arditi identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI for Foreign Exchange Affairs, as the mastermind of these new TEL AVIV 00002760 002 OF 004 efforts. 7.(S) Meir Dagan subsequently told Levey that the CBI had engineered a way for the UN-designated Iranian bank Sepah to conduct foreign business transactions through use of the Iranian Postal Bank. Bank Melli, a USG-designated bank, had also purchased shares in investment funds as a way to escape the effects of the sanctions, according to Dagan. Using these methods, Melli and Sepah have been able to fabricate a method of providing correspondent-like banking services to designated Iranian banks that find it increasingly difficult to deal in foreign currency. Arditi named the &quot;Persia Equity Fund&quot; as one such financial instrument being used by Melli. Levey commented that any such investment fund or financial instrument could be listed as a derivative designation of Melli if enough evidence could be shown linking the two organizations. Levey told Meir Dagan that he was in favor of pursuing a designation of Raei if GOI allegations were accurate. No International Support for Designation of the CBI --------------------------------------------- ------ 8.(S) Arditi and subsequently, Dagan, asked Levey whether the USG was considering a designation of the CBI. Although Treasury had looked into the possibility, said Levey, a designation of the CBI would be ineffective without a multilateral effort. International support for such an effort simply did not yet exist, Levey explained. He told Dagan that we need to build support by sharing info about the CBI&apos;s illicit conduct, similar to the support we built for cutting off the U-turn license. Levey said that it would be better to focus on limiting other central and commercial banks&apos; business with the CBI. Noting that the banking industry relies heavily on reputation, Levey told Arditi that the right strategy is to continue exposing the illicit activities of Iranian banks and banking officials. European Banks&apos; Business with Iran ---------------------------------- 9.(S) MFA interlocutors revisited the progress of European banks in non-proliferation efforts. In a November 16 meeting with Yossi Gal, Senior Deputy Director General, and Alon Bar, Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs, Gal raised concerns that Italy and Germany were falling short in their commitment to enforce sanctions within their banking sectors. Gal told Levey that the MFA was planning a visit to Italy in December, but was unsure whether its attempt to persuade the politicians would filter down to action within the bureaucracy. Gal expressed the same concern about the banking sector in Germany, saying that resistance from the bureaucracy and the private sector often undermined attempts by political figures to improve German regulation. Bar and Gal encouraged Levey to join the GOI in pressing the governments and banking sectors of Germany and Italy to do more. Cautious Optimism on Gulf States -------------------------------- 10.(S) On the status of UAE efforts to stem Iranian finance, Levey told Gal and Bar that he was optimistic about the country&apos;s efforts. Among other examples, he mentioned that the UAE had decreased the number of visas it was issuing to Iranian nationals and that Emirati ministers were receptive to his requests for increased banking regulation. 11.(S) FM Livni told Levey that Israel continues to encourage the Gulf states to more publicly outline their actions against Iranian finance within their banking sectors despite the countries&apos; reasons for keeping such actions secretive. She asked Levey to join in this effort. Levey affirmed that the USG was encouraging sanctions in all sectors and posited that the Iranians were beginning to feel the pressure. Livni asked if the declining price of oil was becoming leverage in the efforts to thwart Iranian financial efforts. Levey said that it was and that the Iranian private sector was becoming more vocal in its criticisms of the government. 12.(S) Levey outlined for his GOI interlocutors recent TEL AVIV 00002760 003 OF 004 efforts by Treasury to broaden its sanctioning of Iran to the shipping, insurance, and reinsurance industries. He cited the designation of IRISL as a positive first step and mentioned that Treasury had found willing partners in Europe and the UK to further efforts in this area. Effect of Sanctions on Iran --------------------------- 13.(S) Dagan told Levey that the economic problems Iran is experiencing as a result of sanctions are encouraging debate within the regime. He said that in order to preserve the revolution, some key figures have begun to consider the need for change. The pressure is on, Dagan said, but he could not estimate when Iran would hit the brink. He noted that the lower cost of oil at the moment would likely prompt Iran to increase its production, thereby encouraging more business through the CBI. With oil prices low everywhere, however, Dagan and Levey agreed that Iran was a less attractive place for investment. Levey told Dagan that the present low oil prices provide a critical opportunity to convince other members of the international community to apply more pressure. 14.(S) Livni asked Levey if there was a risk of Iran regaining a foothold in certain markets as a result of the world financial crisis. Levey said that the market turmoil has worked to the USG&apos;s advantage: the crisis has made financial institutions even more risk-averse, thereby lessening Iran&apos;s attractiveness even further. Additionally, while Iran&apos;s banks are isolated, its economy is not. U.S. Engagement with Iran ------------------------- 15.(S) FM Livni asked Levey during their November 17 meeting why the USG was considering a rapprochement with Iran through a U.S. Interests section in Tehran. She questioned whether the tactic would have a net positive outcome when measured against the negative perceptions such a move would be bound to create. Levey told Livni that this was a question better posed to the State Department, but that her concern was the central issue being debated by policy makers in Washington. In Levey&apos;s previous meeting with MFA officials Bar and Gal, he said that engagement with Iran would not work without leverage, indicating that sanctions would need to be in place no matter what the USG decides to do. --------------------------------------------- ------------- STEMMING PALESTINIAN TERROR FINANCE: GOI PLEASED WITH PA&apos;S PROGRESS --------------------------------------------- ------------- 16.(S) Levey told Arditi that Treasury&apos;s recent designation of the &quot;Union of Good&quot; was proof of the USG&apos;s commitment to continue to work against Hamas and Palestinian terrorists. Levey said, however, that while the USG supported efforts at thwarting terrorism in the territories, the USG wished to keep humanitarian goods flowing to the needy within the population. 17.(S) Arditi told Levey that Palestinian Authority (PA) efforts at stemming terrorism within the territories were going quite well. He said the PA&apos;s positive efforts &quot;surprised&quot; his staff and that he &quot;never thought&quot; the PA would do so well. Levey said that Treasury coordinated with Prime Minister Fayyad on the Union of Good designation and was pleased to hear that PA efforts were held in high regard by the GOI. 18.(S) When Levey inquired about efforts to prevent correspondent banking relations in Gaza from being severed, Arditi said that the Postal Bank &quot;was on the agenda&quot;. Arditi lamented that the services provided by the Postal Bank would not be as good because of its small size and limited capacity. He expressed his hope that the central bank governor would be able to delay the commercial banks&apos; decision to end their relationship with the Palestinians until a permanent solution was ensured. 19.(S) This cable has been cleared by Under Secretary Stuart TEL AVIV 00002760 004 OF 004 Levey. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:53Z", "title": "US embassy cables: US treasury pledges Obama will pressure Iran", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/182122"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The Mossad", "Iran", "US military", "Pakistan", "Turkey", "Saudi Arabia", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "Europe"], "article": "Friday, 31 August 2007, 12:45S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 TEL AVIV 002652 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 08/24/2017 TAGS PREL, PTER, MARR, MASS, KNNP, UNSC, PK, IR, IZ, ZP, JO, EG, RS, CH, LE, SY, IS SUBJECT: U/S BURNS&apos; AUGUST 17 MEETING WITH ISRAELI MOSSAD CHIEF MEIR DAGANClassified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones. Reasons: 1.4 (b)(d). ------- SUMMARY ------- 1. (S) In an August 17 meeting, Israeli Mossad Chief Meir Dagan thanked Under Secretary Burns for America&apos;s support of Israel as evidenced by the previous day&apos;s signing of an MOU that provides Israel with USD 30 billion in security assistance from 2008-2018. Dagan provided his assessment of the Middle East region, Pakistan and Turkey, stressing Israel&apos;s (a) concern for President Musharraf&apos;s well-being, (b) view that Iran can be forced to change its behavior, and (c) sense that Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are unstable with unclear futures ahead of them. Dagan probed for more detail about U.S. military assistance to the Gulf states, and -- while signaling agreement with the U.S. approach to the Gulf states vis-a-vis Iran -- cautioned that they may not be able to absorb significant military assistance. Dagan reviewed Israel&apos;s five-pillar strategy concerning Iran&apos;s nuclear program, stressed that Iran is economically vulnerable, and pressed for more activity with Iran&apos;s minority groups aimed at regime change. Dagan urged caution in providing assistance to the Siniora government in Lebanon, noting Syrian and Iranian efforts to topple the GOL. 2. (S) Under Secretary Burns cited the MOU as tangible evidence of the USG&apos;s commitment to Israel, and stressed that the U.S. would support all of its friends -- Arabs included -- in the Middle East, and will remain engaged in the region for the long term. He described U.S. efforts to support the Musharraf and Karzai governments as they face opposition from Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and explained that the Gulf Security Dialogue is meant to bolster Gulf states facing threats from Iran. The Under Secretary reviewed U.S. efforts to isolate Iran and increase pressure on it, stressing that the U.S. is currently focused on the diplomatic track. He shared USG thinking about the Siniora government in Lebanon, and urged that the U.S. and Israel continue to consult on Lebanon. END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------------- THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE MOU AND ISRAEL&apos;S QME -------------------------------------------- 3. (S) Dagan observed that the signing of the MOU on security assistance could not have come at a better time, and stressed that Israel appreciated America&apos;s support. The Under Secretary agreed about the timing, noting that the U.S., Israel and like-minded countries were facing multiple threats around the world, and that the Middle East is a very dangerous region. He said that the MOU serves as a concrete reminder that the U.S. stands by its long-term security commitments to its friends, and is ready to help them with their needs. The Under Secretary noted that the Middle East is now at the heart of American interests. Because Egypt also plays a vital role in the region, the U.S. would also renew its security assistance commitment to that country. U.S. relations with the Gulf states were longstanding, and America would stay true to those friendships, as well. The Under Secretary stressed that the USG is committed to Israel&apos;s QME. He noted that the majority of systems and equipment that the U.S. would sell to Egypt and other Arab partners would replace items that had been sold to those countries in the past. ------------------------------------------- DAGAN REVIEWS MIDDLE EAST, PAKISTAN, TURKEY ------------------------------------------- 4. (S) Assessing the region, Dagan said Israel sees itself in the middle of a rapidly changing environment, in which the fate of one Middle Eastern country is connected to another. Dagan then said he was concerned about how long Pakistani President Musharraf would survive: &quot;He is facing a serious problem with the militants. Pakistan&apos;s nuclear capability could end up in the hands of an Islamic regime.&quot; Turning to Iran, Dagan observed that it is in a transition period. There is debate among the leadership between Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad and their respective supporters. Instability in Iran is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic minorities. This, Dagan said, presents unique opportunities, and Israelis and Americans might see a change in Iran in TEL AVIV 00002652 002 OF 005 their lifetimes. As for Iraq, it may end up a weak, federal state comprised of three cantons or entities, one each belonging to the Kurds, Sunnis and Shias. 5. (S) Dagan said that the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia are concerned about the growing importance of Iran and its influence on them. They are taking precautions, trying to increase their own military defensive capabilities. Referring to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan warned that these countries would not be able to cope with the amount of weapons systems they intend to acquire: &quot;They do not use the weapons effectively.&quot; 6. (S) Dagan said that Jordan has successfully faced down threats from the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and that Egypt is struggling with the question of who will replace President Mubarak. He said he sees no hope for the Palestinians, and that Israel looks at Syria and Lebanon, and sees only instability. Further afield, it looks at Turkey and sees Islamists gaining momentum there. The question, he asked, is how long Turkey&apos;s military -- viewing itself as the defender of Turkey&apos;s secular identity -- will remain quiet. 7. (S) If Israel&apos;s neighborhood were not unstable enough, Dagan observed, it did not help that Russia is playing a &quot;very negative role&quot; in the region. He observed that all of these challenges have to be addressed globally -- they could not be dealt with individually. Returning to Jordan as an example, he noted that the more than one million Iraqi refugees in Jordan were changing Jordanian society, and forcing it into a new relationship with Saudi Arabia. This is evidenced by Saudi King Abdullah&apos;s recent visit to Jordan, which implies greater understanding between the Jordanians and the Saudis. ---------------------------------------- DISCUSSION OF THE GULF SECURITY DIALOGUE ---------------------------------------- 8. (S) Turning to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan said that enhancing the capabilities of the Gulf states &quot;is the right direction to go,&quot; especially as they are afraid of Iran. Such a U.S. commitment will be a stabilizing factor in the region. Dagan clarified that he would not oppose U.S. security assistance to America&apos;s Arab partners. He expressed concern, nevertheless, about the current policies of those partners -- especially with regards to Syria and Iran. Dagan added that if those countries must choose between buying defensive systems from the U.S. or France, then he would prefer they buy systems from the U.S., as this would bring them closer to the U.S. 9. (S) Dagan observed that the challenge facing the U.S. now is how to unite the Gulf states under a shared policy, and pointed to Qatar as the weakest link in the chain, trying to play all sides. Under Secretary Burns replied that the U.S. is trying to get Qatar and its neighbors to look at issues from a regional perspective, and to focus on threats in a unified way. Acting PM Assistant Secretary Mull expressed understanding for Israel&apos;s frustration with how the region looked, but stressed nevertheless that if America did not engage the Gulf states through the GSD, the situation would become much worse. It is critical to get the Gulf states focused on the Iran threat, and to adopt a regional approach to countering it. Encouraging and supporting their counterproliferation efforts would be crucial. Dagan said he agreed with this approach, stressing that the threat of radical Islam is real. --------------------------------------------- ---- IRAN: DAGAN REVIEWS ISRAEL&apos;S FIVE PILLAR STRATEGY --------------------------------------------- ---- 10. (S) Dagan led discussion on Iran by pointing out that the U.S. and Israel have different timetables concerning when Iran is likely to acquire a nuclear capability. He clarified that the Israel Atomic Energy Commission&apos;s (IAEC) timetable is purely technical in nature, while the Mossad&apos;s considers other factors, including the regime&apos;s determination to succeed. While Dagan acknowledged that there is still time to &quot;resolve&quot; the Iran nuclear crisis, he stressed that Iran is making a great effort to achieve a nuclear capability: &quot;The threat is obvious, even if we have a different timetable. If we want to postpone their acquisition of a TEL AVIV 00002652 003 OF 005 nuclear capability, then we have to invest time and effort ourselves.&quot; 11. (S) Dagan described how the Israeli strategy consists of five pillars: A) Political Approach: Dagan praised efforts to bring Iran before the UNSC, and signaled his agreement with the pursuit of a third sanctions resolution. He acknowledged that pressure on Iran is building up, but said this approach alone will not resolve the crisis. He stressed that the timetable for political action is different than the nuclear project&apos;s timetable. B) Covert Measures: Dagan and the Under Secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting. C) Counterproliferation: Dagan underscored the need to prevent know-how and technology from making their way to Iran, and said that more can be done in this area. D) Sanctions: Dagan said that the biggest successes had so far been in this area. Three Iranian banks are on the verge of collapse. The financial sanctions are having a nationwide impact. Iran&apos;s regime can no longer just deal with the bankers themselves. E) Force Regime Change: Dagan said that more should be done to foment regime change in Iran, possibly with the support of student democracy movements, and ethnic groups (e.g., Azeris, Kurds, Baluchs) opposed to the ruling regime. 12. (S) Dagan clarified that the U.S., Israel and like-minded countries must push on all five pillars at the same time. Some are bearing fruit now; others would bear fruit in due time, especially if more attention were placed on them. Dagan urged more attention on regime change, asserting that more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic minorities in Iran. He said he was sure that Israel and the U.S. could &quot;change the ruling regime in Iran, and its attitude towards backing terror regimes.&quot; He added, &quot;We could also get them to delay their nuclear project. Iran could become a normal state.&quot; 13. (S) Dagan stressed that Iran has weak spots that can be exploited. According to his information, unemployment exceeds 30 percent nationwide, with some towns and villages experiencing 50 percent unemployment, especially among 17-30 year olds. Inflation averages more than 40 percent, and people are criticizing the government for investing in and sponsoring Hamas, saying that they government should invest in Iran itself. &quot;The economy is hurting,&quot; he said, &quot;and this is provoking a real crisis among Iran&apos;s leaders.&quot; He added that Iran&apos;s minorities are &quot;raising their heads, and are tempted to resort to violence.&quot; 14. (S) Dagan suggested that more could be done to get the Europeans to take a tougher stand against Iran. Under Secretary Burns agreed, and suggested that Israel could help SIPDIS by reaching out to the Europeans. Dagan said that Israel is already doing this, and would continue to do so. Dagan reiterated the need to strike at Iran&apos;s heart by engaging with its people directly. Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts are important, but more radio transmissions in Farsi are needed. Coordination with the Gulf states is helpful, but the U.S. should also coordinate with Azerbaijan and countries to the north of Iran, to put pressure on Iran. Russia, he said, would be annoyed, but it would be fitting, as Russia appears bent on showing the U.S. that it cannot act globally without considering Russia. 15. (S) Under Secretary Burns stressed that the USG is focused on Iran not only because of its nuclear program, but also because it supports terrorism and Shiite militias in Iraq. The U.S. approach is currently focused on the diplomatic track and increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions. Work in the UNSC helps to define the Iranian nuclear threat as one that affects international security, and not just that of Israel. While UNSC members Russia, China and Qatar will water down efforts to increase pressure on Iran, it is still worthwhile to push for a third sanctions resolution. In the meantime, the U.S. will encourage the Europeans, Japan and South Korea to implement unilateral sanctions against Iran outside the UNSC framework. The U.S. TEL AVIV 00002652 004 OF 005 will continue to encourage banks and financial institutions to slow down their operations in Iran and financially isolate it. Regarding military pressure, the Under Secretary noted that the U.S. has deployed 1-2 carrier battle groups in the Gulf over the last six months, and that President Bush has stated that he will interrupt Iran&apos;s activity in Iraq. As for outreach to the Iranian people, the VOA is now broadcasting programs in Farsi, and the USG is trying to get more Iranian students to visit the U.S. to promote people-to-people relations. ----------------------------------------- PAKISTAN: ISRAEL WORRIED ABOUT MUSHARRAF ----------------------------------------- 16. (S) On Pakistan, Dagan said that President Musharraf is losing control, and that some of his coalition partners could threaten him in the future. The key question, Dagan said, is whether Musharraf retains his commander-in-chief role in addition to his role as president. If not, he will have problems. Dagan observed that there has been an increase in the number of attempts on Musharraf&apos;s life, and wondered whether he will survive the next few years. Under Secretary Burns replied that South Asia has assumed vital importance in American foreign policy since September 11. The U.S. is committed to denying Afghanistan as a safe-haven for Taliban and Al-Qaeda activity. The USG will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf, and is seeking to boost his military defensive capabilities. At the same time, the U.S. is encouraging Pakistan and Afghanistan to work with each other militarily. Turning to India, Under Secretary Burns noted that U.S.-Indian economic cooperation is growing, and that the USG is working effectively to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan. ----------------------------- LEBANON: DAGAN URGES CAUTION ----------------------------- 17. (S) Dagan urged caution with respect to Lebanon, noting that the results of efforts there to bolster the Siniora government would impact Syria and Iraq. The U.S. and Israel, he said, are on the edge of achieving something in Lebanon, and so cannot afford to drop their guard. What is necessary is finding the right way to support PM Siniora. &quot;He is a courageous man,&quot; Dagan said. Syria, Iran and Hizballah are working hard against him. Dagan noted that much of what is animating the leadership of Lebanon to take on Syria is personal: &quot;Hariri, Jumblat and others had their parents executed by the Syrians.&quot; This anti-Syrian sentiment has forged an alliance based on personal and national interests. Siniora has worked well with the situation, but Dagan suggested that the odds are against him. Under Secretary Burns replied that the U.S. is trying to give PM Siniora as much support as possible, and that we would continue to consult closely with Israel on Lebanon. He noted that he would return to Israel in October. -------------------- MEETING PARTICIPANTS -------------------- 18, (SBU) Accompanying Under Secretary Burns in the meeting were: -- Ambassador Richard H.

Cretz for reasons 1.4 (B/D). 1. (S) SUMMARY: Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (AFHSC), met Mossad Director Meir Dagan on July 12 for a general discussion of regional security threats. On the Iranian nuclear program, Dagan proved surprisingly optimistic about the effects of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and their impact on Iranian elites. On most other fronts, however, Dagan expressed deep skepticism regarding any near-term solutions. Dagan believes that the Syrians were emboldened by the Second Lebanon War, and argued for a concerted international effort to enforce UNSC resolutions in Lebanon as a means of removing Syria from Iranian influence. In Dagan&apos;s personal opinion, present attempts to prop up the government of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad will fail, and &quot;an entirely new approach&quot; with the Palestinians is required. Dagan and Townsend surveyed political developments in North Africa, Turkey, and the Gulf, and shared concerns about Pakistan&apos;s ability to withstand the challenge of Islamic radicals. END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------- Financial Sanctions Offer Hope on Iran -------------------------------------- 2. (S) Mossad Director Meir Dagan began his two-hour meeting with Townsend by expressing satisfaction with sanctions against Iran. Dagan said UNSC Resolutions 1737 and 1747 caught the Iranians off-guard, and were having an impact on the Iranian elite and financial community. The resolutions had been particularly successful through their indirect consequences, explained Dagan, by stigmatizing Iranian businesses and discouraging risk-averse Europeans from being connected with Iran. Dagan praised ongoing GOI-USG cooperation on this front, and added that domestic economic problems were creating additional pressure on the regime. 3. (S) With regard to their nuclear program, Dagan said the Iranians are attempting to convey a &quot;false presentation&quot; that they have mastered the uranium enrichment process. The reality is that they are not there yet, said Dagan, and they are paying a heavy political price (sanctions) for something they have yet to achieve. Dagan noted growing antipathy in Russia towards Iran and its nuclear program, and said the Iranians were shocked by Russian statements accusing them of supporting terrorism against the United States. In Dagan&apos;s view, there is no ideological conflict within the Iranian leadership (all wish to see the destruction of Israel), but there is a growing divide on tactics with some supporting a retaliatory position against the West and others favoring new policies of moderation. Recognizing the growing strength of the moderate camp, Dagan said that the militant followers of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are now trying to target supporters of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as spies. --------------------------------------------- - Gulf States Await Action (From Others) on Iran --------------------------------------------- - 4. (S) According to Dagan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States all fear Iran, but want someone else &quot;to do the job for them.&quot; Townsend and Dagan discussed the current state of affairs in the Saudi royal court, where the Mossad Chief accused Foreign Minister Saud bin Faysal of playing a &quot;very negative role.&quot; He also pointed to the recent visit of the Saudi King Abdullah to Jordan as a historical first and turning point for relations between the two countries. Townsend agreed, and said that the Saudi king has a sense of urgency on the political front. Dagan characterized Qatar as &quot;a real problem,&quot; and accused Sheikh Hamid of &quot;annoying everyone.&quot; In his view, Qatar is trying to play all sides -- Syria, Iran, Hamas -- in an effort to achieve security and some degree of independence. &quot;I think you should remove your bases from there...seriously,&quot; said Dagan. &quot;They have confidence only because of the U.S. presence.&quot; Dagan predicted, with some humor, that al-Jazeera would be the next cause of war in the Middle East as some Arab leaders (specifically Saudi Arabia) are willing to take drastic steps to shut down the channel, and hold Sheikh Hamid personally responsible for its provocations. ---------------------------- Syria Taking Dangerous Risks ---------------------------- TEL AVIV 00002280 002 OF 003 5. (S) Dagan echoed other reports that Syria expects an Israeli attack this summer, and has raised its level of readiness. Despite the fact that Israel has no intention of attacking, said Dagan, the Syrians are likely to retaliate over even the smallest incident, which could lead to quick escalation. Dagan believes that Syria&apos;s strategic alliance with Iran and Hizballah has not changed, and that Assad views these policies as both &quot;successful and just.&quot; There is a tendency to assume that Syria can be separated from Iran, said Dagan, and that this offers the key to weakening Hizballah. Dagan argued that the opposite is true: by enforcing UN resolutions on Lebanon and increasing efforts to disarm Hizballah, the international community can remove the glue that binds Iran and Syria. Enforcing the resolutions would put additional pressure on Assad, who fears being tried for the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri above all else. The advantage of such an approach, continued Dagan, is that the legal ground is already in place for action by the UNSC. This credible threat could sufficiently frighten Syria away from Iran and towards more natural allies in the Arab League. --------------------------------------------- Deep Pessimism on Relations With Palestinians --------------------------------------------- 6. (S) Departing from official GOI policy, Dagan expressed his personal opinion that after more than a decade of trying to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians, &quot;nothing will be achieved.&quot; Only Israeli military operations against Hamas in the West Bank prevent them from expanding control beyond Gaza, lamented Dagan, without which Fatah would fall within one month and Abbas would join his &quot;mysteriously wealthy&quot; son in Qatar. Offering what he believed to be a conservative estimate, Dagan said that USD 6 billion had been invested in the Palestinian Authority since 1994. &quot;What did it accomplish, other than adding a few more people to the Fortune 500?&quot; asked Dagan. Although he expressed his personal faith in Salam Fayyad, Dagan said that the Palestinian Prime Minister had no power base. Fatah as a party would have to completely reorganize itself in order to regain credibility, argued Dagan, but instead they have turned once again to the &quot;old guard.&quot; The Mossad Chief suggested that a completely new approach was required, but did not provide Townsend any additional details. -------------------------------------- Pakistan...and Other Regional Concerns -------------------------------------- 7. (S) Townsend and Dagan then embarked on an informal tour of the region, comparing notes on countries critical to combating terrorism. Dagan characterized a Pakistan ruled by radical Islamists with a nuclear arsenal at their disposal as his biggest nightmare. Al-Qaeda and other &quot;Global Jihad&quot; groups could not be relied upon to behave rationally once in possession of nuclear weapons, said Dagan, as they do not care about the well being of states or their image in the media. &quot;We have to keep (President Pervez) Musharaf in power,&quot; said Dagan. In North Africa, Dagan contended that Qaddafi needs to be pushed more in order to put Libya on the right track. Qaddafi faces little domestic pressure, said Dagan, but has traditionally responded to outside threats and runs foreign policy based on his emotions. The only reason Qaddafi moderated his position to begin with, said Dagan, was that he feared that he was &quot;in the crosshairs&quot; for regime change. Dagan viewed the situation in Algeria as more serious, with the south of the country becoming increasingly dangerous and the leadership uncertain as it faces radical Islamic forces. Morocco is coping better with these issues &quot;in spite of the king,&quot; said Dagan, who appears to take little interest in governing. In Turkey, Dagan said that Islamists there are not of the same cloth as others in the region, but he does fear that they are slowly breaking down the secular character of the state and could become more radical over time. Dagan argued that if the Turkish military received more direct support from the United States, it would be better able to prevent the rise of Islamists. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** TEL AVIV 00002280 003 OF 003 CRETZ", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:15:05Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Mossad chief wants to 'detach' Syria from Iran", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/116742"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Ehud Olmert", "Palestinian territories", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "US foreign policy", "The US embassy cables", "US news"], "article": "Monday, 08 January 2007, 16:38S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 000064 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/05/2017 TAGS PREL, PTER, PGOV, IS, KWBG SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE SECRETARY&apos;S JANUARY 13-15 VISIT TO ISRAELClassified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S) Madam Secretary, internal tensions among GOI leaders have intensified since your last visit and have reached the point that there appears to be little coordination or even dialogue among the key decision makers. Therefore, we will need to be sensitive to perceptions that we are favoring one faction over another. The divisions at the top here are part of an increasingly gloomy public mood, with a new corruption allegations making headlines virtually daily, and a growing sense of political failure despite Israel&apos;s strong economy and a sustained success rate in thwarting suicide attacks. Prime Minister Olmert&apos;s approval ratings were only 23 percent in the latest poll, and Israeli interlocutors across the political spectrum are speaking openly of a crisis of public confidence in the country&apos;s leadership at a time when Israelis feel an urgent need for strong leadership to face the threats from Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hizballah. OPTIMISM ERODING ---------------- 2. (S) The year 2007 has started off badly for Israelis. The good feeling generated by PM Olmert&apos;s long-delayed December 23 summit meeting with Abu Mazen quickly dissipated under the weight of reports of a new settlement in the Jordan Valley (now suspended by Peretz), continued Qassam rocket attacks on Sderot and neighboring kibbutzim, foot-dragging on both sides in implementing the transfer of tax revenues, lack of progress on the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, and the unpleasant atmospherics of the January 4 Olmert-Mubarak summit, which was overshadowed by a botched IDF daylight raid in the center of Ramallah in which four Palestinians were killed. 3. (S) The Ramallah operation, which was authorized by the IDF&apos;s West Bank commander without informing the Minister of Defense, served as a stark reminder of the lack of coordination between Israel&apos;s military and its civilian leadership. When it comes to Israel&apos;s strategy for dealing with Palestinians, it increasingly seems that military is military, civilian is civilian and never the twain shall meet! Despite Olmert&apos;s belated embrace of Abu Mazen as a peace partner, there is growing concern that moderate Arab willingness to maintain the embargo on Hamas may be eroding, and that Fatah may fail to muster the popular support it will need to depose Hamas, whether at the ballot box or in the streets. Meanwhile, the upcoming release of the results of the Winograd Commission&apos;s investigation of the Lebanon war hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of Olmert, Defense Minister Peretz, and IDF Chief of General Staff Halutz. Peretz and Halutz have both publicly stated that they will resign if the Commission holds them responsible for serious errors in the conduct of the war, but Olmert has refrained from public comments. Olmert is also awaiting the results of several separate investigations involving corruption allegations, any one of which could further damage him severely, if not force his resignation. 4. (S) While Israeli anxiety over a possible dramatic shift of U.S. policy as a result of the Iraq Study Group&apos;s report has been allayed by statements by you and the President, there continues to be deep uneasiness here that the Baker-Hamilton recommendations reflect the shape of things to come in U.S. policy. Israelis recognize that U.S. public support for the Iraq war is eroding and are following with interest the President&apos;s upcoming articulation of the revamped policy, but they are deeply concerned that Israeli-Palestinian issues not become linked in American minds to creating a more propitious regional environment for whatever steps we decide to take to address the deteriorating situation in Iraq. 5. (S) Iran&apos;s nuclear program continues to cause great anxiety in Israel. Given their history, Israelis across the political spectrum take very seriously Ahmadinejad&apos;s threats to wipe Israel off the map. Olmert has been quite clear in his public comments that Israel cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran, a position stated even more emphatically by opposition leader Netanyahu, who compares today&apos;s Iran to Nazi Germany in 1938. Despite the worst-case assessments of Israeli intelligence, however, there is a range of views about what action Israel should take. The MFA and some of the think tank Iran experts appear increasingly inclined to state that military action must be a last resort and are taking a new interests in other forms of pressure, including but not limited to sanctions, that could force Iran to abandon its military nuclear program. The IDF, however, srikes us as more inclined than ever to look toward a military strike, whether launched by Israel or by us, as the only way to destroy or even delay Iran&apos;s plans. Thoughtful TEL AVIV 00000064 002 OF 003 Israeli analysts point out that even if a nuclear-armed Iran did not immediately launch a strike on the Israeli heartland, the very fact that Iran possesses nuclear weapons would completely transform the Middle East strategic environment in ways that would make Israel&apos;s long-term survival as a democratic Jewish state increasingly problematic. That concern is most intensively reflected in open talk by those who say they do not want their children and grandchildren growing up in an Israel threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. LIVNI RISING ------------ 6. (C) FM Tzipi Livni is frustrated by Olmert&apos;s continued refusal to coordinate closely, and -- perhaps with an eye on polls showing her popularity at over double the level of the Prime Minister -- suggested to a Ha&apos;aretz interviewer in late December that she would challenge Olmert for the prime ministership if he continued not to give her his full backing. In the same interview, Livni provided an outline of her thinking, but not a detailed plan, on the way ahead with the Arabs, including negotiating an interim agreement with the Palestinians in which the separation barrier would serve as the border, and refusing to engage with Syria unless Asad takes steps to end support for terrorism and distances himself from Iran. Livni&apos;s policy adviser has confirmed to us that she has engaged in her own discrete discussions with Palestinians, but very much in an exploratory mode. Livni told Senators Kerry and Dodd that she doubted that a final status agreement could be reached with Abu Mazen, and therefore the emphasis should be on reforming Fatah so that it could beat Hamas at the polls. MFA officials tell us that Livni is also focused on the need to keep Hamas isolated. She and her senior staff have repeatedly expressed concern that some EU member-states are wobbly on this point. Meanwhile, Livni is keenly aware that unlike Olmert, she has little to fear from the Winograd Commission report (nor is she tainted by the corruption allegations that dog Olmert). Her incipient bid to take Olmert&apos;s place could become more serious once the report&apos;s preliminary conclusions are released next month. SHIFTING VIEWS ON SYRIA ----------------------- 7. (S) Olmert and Livni agree that negotiations with Syria would be a trap that Damascus would use to end the international pressure on it and to gain a freer hand in Lebanon. While they see public relations downsides to dismissing Syrian peace overtures out of hand, they continue to insist that no negotiations will be possible until Syria reduces its support for terrorism and/or takes direct steps to secure the release of Israeli prisoners held by Hamas and Hizballah. Olmert and Livni are supported in that view by Mossad chief Dagan, who takes a dim view of Syrian intentions. A significant part of the security establishment, however, appears to be reaching the conclusion that it is in Israel&apos;s interest to test Asad&apos;s intentions -- possibly through the use of a back channel contact -- and to seek to wean him away from Tehran. They are joined in that view by Defense Minister Peretz, much of the Labor Party and the Israeli left, who argue that Israel cannot afford to refuse to at least explore Asad&apos;s offer to negotiate, often comparing that stance to Golda Meir&apos;s much-criticized decision to spurn Sadat&apos;s offer to negotiate, which then led to the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Press reports January 5 stated that the defense establishment had recommended to Olmert that he open an exploratory channel to Damascus in two months, a timeline reportedly linked to the completion of reviews of U.S. policy toward Iraq and the Middle East, as well as to clearer indications of Abu Mazen&apos;s intentions and capabilities vis a vis Hamas. PERETZ-OLMERT TENSIONS ---------------------- 8. (C) According to leaks from a recent Labor Party leadership meeting, Amir Peretz said that he feels completely disconnected from Olmert. Ever since Peretz&apos; telephone conversation with Abu Mazen which infuriated Olmert, the two reportedly barely speak to each other. Television news reports on January 4 trumpeted rumors that Olmert had decided to remove Peretz as Defense Minister and replace him with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has already announced plans to challenge Peretz for the Labor Party&apos;s leadership in late May primaries. Even though the Prime Minister&apos;s Office almost immediately denied the reports, there is little doubt here that someone in the PMO was behind them. While much of the Labor Party feels that Peretz has been a failure, both as Defense Minister and as Party Secretary General, and Peretz&apos; popularity with the general public has hit rock bottom, Labor TEL AVIV 00000064 003 OF 003 members widely condemned the media trial balloon, which they saw as an unacceptable attempt by Olmert&apos;s advisers to intervene in their party&apos;s leadership contest. In any event, the incident is yet another indication of the intense degree of personal rancor and dysfunction prevailing at the top of the GOI. PERETZ AND SNEH OUR AMA PARTNERS -------------------------------- 9. (C) Notwithstanding the GOI&apos;s internal discord, there is some good news in our efforts to nudge the GOI toward improvements in Palestinian quality of life issues. Despite his political woes, Peretz has proven himself a serious partner in our efforts to implement the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA) and more generally in a slow but steady push by the MOD to force a reluctant IDF to accept steps to reduce barriers to Palestinian movement and to revive the Palestinian economy. Deputy Defense Minister Efraim Sneh, who will likely accompany Peretz to your meeting, has emerged as the point man for these efforts. Sneh shares Peretz&apos; conviction that Israel&apos;s security stranglehold on the Palestinians is &quot;winning the battle but losing the war,&quot; but Sneh, who in a decades-long career served as a military governor of the West Bank, commanded an elite combat unit, and took part in the famed Entebbe raid, also has both an intimate knowledge of the Palestinians and a combat commander&apos;s credibility with the IDF that Peretz sorely lacks. Your meeting with Peretz provides an opportunity to express appreciation for his and Sneh&apos;s efforts and to encourage them in their struggle to bring recalcitrant elements in the IDF to heel. The more progress we can achieve with them on AMA implementation now, the easier it will be to achieve meaningful results with both parties in the coming year. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:15:06Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Israeli optimism erodes in face of regional enemies", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the State Department&apos;s Classified SIPRNET website."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/91784"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "Saudi Arabia", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US military", "The US embassy cables", "US national security", "US news"], "article": "Wednesday, 18 November 2009, 14:30S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 002500 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 11/17/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PTER, EG, CH, IR, RU, SA, LE, TU, IS SUBJECT: 40TH JOINT POLITICAL-MILITARY GROUP: EXECUTIVE SESSION (PART 1 OF 4)Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 1. (S) Summary: During the Executive Session of the 40th Joint Political Military Group (JPMG), U.S. and Israeli counterparts continued discussion on the creation of four new Qualitative Military Edge (QME) working groups. GOI interlocutors continued to raise concerns regarding the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia. Both sides agreed that continued pressure be applied to Iran, especially following the disclosure of the nuclear facility in Qom. GOI participants expressed concern regarding Chinese and Russian cooperation with respect to enhanced Iranian sanctions. The GOI also raised dual citizenship concerns with respect to access to sensitive technology, and noted from its perspective Turkey&apos;s disturbing change of course toward Syria and Iran -- and away from Israel. This is the first in four cables (septels) reporting on the JPMG. End summary. 2.

(S) The Executive Session continued discussion from the September 30 Qualitative Military Edge (QME) meeting in Washington. Both sides presented their primary points of contact for the four newly proposed working groups focusing on previous agreements, mitigation measures for the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia, technical mitigation issues, and intelligence/policy. Agreement was reached to begin working on the details of each working group&apos;s meeting schedule and timeline. 4. (S) The GOI continued to express concern over the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia. U.S. participants noted that the USG is unable to provide more detailed information about the sale until Saudi Arabia officially sends a Letter of Request (LOR). The GOI expressed additional concerns about stationing these new aircraft at Tabuk airfield in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia -- close to the Israeli border. U.S. participants stated the USG understanding that this should not be an issue, as the Saudis are considering stationing new Typhoon aircraft at Tabuk. The GOI also raised AMRAAM sales to Jordan; U.S. participants explained that the new C-7 AMRAAM is an export version with capabilities similar to the C-5 version -- and therefore provides little to no increase in capabilities. Iran, China and Russia ---------------------- 5. (S) Both sides expressed concern over the recent revelation regarding Iran&apos;s nuclear facility at Qom, and agreed that increased pressure should be applied directly and internationally against Iran in order to better determine Tehran&apos;s motives and next steps. Both sides agreed that the facility at Qom should be inspected immediately. One member of the Israeli delegation expressed the opinion that some consideration be given to &quot;shutting Qom operations down completely&quot; to prevent further progress on obtaining a nuclear weapon. That said, the GOI argued that the international community not become bogged down on the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) and Qom, thereby diverting focus from TEL AVIV 00002500 002 OF 002 the bigger issue of Iran&apos;s nuclear program. 6. (S) Several questions were raised about China&apos;s position on Iran&apos;s efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon. Both sides agreed that continued engagement with China and Russia is needed -- as well as building a consensus in Europe. The USG speculated, and the GOI concurred, that China will follow Moscow&apos;s lead. USG participants argued that China would seek to avoid an international confrontation over Iran. The GOI described 2010 as a critical year -- if the Iranians continue to protect and harden their nuclear sites, it will be more difficult to target and damage them. Both sides then discussed the upcoming delivery of GBU-28 bunker busting bombs to Israel, noting that the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the USG is helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran. 7. (S) The GOI made the case for &quot;crippling sanctions&quot;; cooperation between the United States, Europe, Russia and China will be necessary in order for these sanctions to be effective. U.S. participants stressed the USG position that any discussions with Iran on this subject be finite; the USG will continue to monitor whether negotiations are making progress. The GOI stated that it is not convinced the Iranians will negotiate in good faith unless there are visible and clear threats. U.S. delegation members described eight lanes of sanctions, and outlined a plan to &quot;pivot to apply appropriate pressure&quot; on those points and tracks that have the most impact. U.S. participants concurred that 2010 is a critical year -- but the continued application of pressure is vital. 8. (S) Regarding Russia, the GOI was not confident that Moscow will be helpful in any Iranian sanctions effort -- GOI participants opined that Russia is considered a &quot;mystery&quot; with respect to their views on Iran. The GOI raised the Russian S-300 sale to Iran, noting that the transfer is still pending. GOI participants argued that Moscow seeks a return to superpower status, but there are contradictory trends regarding Russia&apos;s internal condition. Dual Citizenship Issues ----------------------- 9. (S) The GOI raised the issue of dual citizenship within the context of access to sensitive technology. U.S. participants acknowledged Israeli concerns, noting that the issue is being worked at the highest levels of the USG to reach consensus on how to proceed. The GOI recommended obtaining a waiver similar to the relationship from which Canada or Australia benefit. Turkey ------ 10. (S) The GOI raised the current direction the Government of Turkey has taken toward Syria and Iran -- and away from Israel. Israeli participants argued that Turkey has been supportive of Hamas in Gaza while pursuing a more &quot;Islamic&quot; direction with the goal of becoming a regional superpower. The GOI argued that the Turkish military is losing its ability to influence government decisions and strategic direction. After this past year, GOI participants said they have a &quot;bad feeling&quot; about Turkey. The GOI noted that the Israel Air Force (IAF) Commander in the past wanted to speak to the Turkish Air Force Commander, but his Turkish counterpart declined. 11.

WEXLER DISCUSSES IRAN WITH IDF INTELLIGENCE CHIEF YADLINClassified By: DCM Luis G, Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S) Representative Robert Wexler (D, Florida), accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Rogin and DCM Moreno, met with Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Chief, MG Amos Yadlin, on Sunday 10 May 2009. MG Yadlin focused his discussion on the preparations for the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu to the United States and the Iranian nuclear program. MG Yadlin informed Rep. Wexler that the PM was preparing intensely for his upcoming visit to Washington. In addition to hours of policy review, the PM had been provided significant amounts of intelligence from the IDI and Mossad on Iran&apos;s nuclear program. The intelligence presented included assessments of the current status of the Iranian program; timelines, effects of sanctions; views of the international community; and outcomes of engagement. The differences that exist between the intelligence community in interpretations of the Iranian nuclear program as well as the relationship between Iran and the Palestinians were also presented. MG Yadlin indicated that the IDF had presented its information last week, leaving the cabinet on Friday 08 May 2009 to consider policy options and how information will be presented during the upcoming visit to Washington. Although no direct feedback was provided, MG Yadlin opined that the PM appears determined on Iran. 2. (S) Rep. Wexler asked MG Yadlin to expand on the differences in the interpretations of the intelligence. MG Yadlin explained that until 2003, Iran had violated the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty by having a weaponization group and although Iran could show civilian uses for a missile program and a fissile program, there was no justification for a weaponization group. He went on to say that Iran halted its program in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq, but reinvigorated the program in 2005. He expressed that some in the US agree with this and others do not. He went on to explain that Israel is not in a position to underestimate Iran and be surprised like the US was on 11 September 2001. 3. (S) MG Yadlin explained that Israel tries to be more precise than the US in estimating Iran&apos;s intentions and timeline for obtaining a nuclear bomb. Iran is in the position of wanting to pay only a minimum cost for its current program. It does not want to be North Korea or what Iraq was before 2003. Iran intends to keep resolutions and sanctions at a certain manageable level and continue to produce low enriched uranium until there is enough for several bombs. MG Yadlin stated that Iran could decide to produce a bomb by 2010, but Iran is waiting for the right time in the future and that there are some who will always doubt it despite the evidence. 4. (S) Rep. Wexler then asked about the prospect of engagement. MG Yadlin said he does not oppose engagement, and in fact gave a speech approximately six months ago expressing that Israel needed to find a way to find positives in engagement. He feels there needs to be an agreed upon deadline; a measure for success or failure; and a plan B if engagement does not work in order for engagement to have any chance. He also expressed strongly that engagement should have already started. MG Yadlin outlined four possible outcomes of engagement. Two good outcomes would be the Iranian nuclear program stopped or a failure of engagement that allows Russia and China to see the US made all efforts to prevent the program diplomatically and allows for greater cooperation in the future. Two bad outcomes would be Iran playing for time with no claim of failure on the part of engagement or a bad bargain that still allows Iran to obtain a nuclear bomb even if in a longer timeline. Rep. Wexler went on to discuss that there is a third good option in that the President may have better leverage with the American public to support action if engagement efforts are attempted and failed. Rep Wexler recommended that the Israeli people need to consider the US perspective and public opinion. MG Yadlin responded that he is not recommending the US enter a third front, but it has to be understood that Israel sees things differently and that Israel has to be ready and can not remove the military option from the table. Rep Wexler stated that he expected Israel would be pleasantly surprised by the President&apos;s acceptance of all possible options in regards to Iran. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:15:11Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Israel 'can't afford to be wrong about Iran'", "sentences": ["********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/206775"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The Mossad", "Iran", "The US embassy cables", "Nuclear weapons", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Israel regarded 2010 as a &quot;critical year&quot; for tackling Iran&apos;s alleged quest for nuclear weapons and has warned the United States that time is running out to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb. Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, told American congressmen in June 2009 there was a window of &quot;between six and 18 months from now in which stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable&quot;. After that, Barak said \u2013 in a striking admission recorded in a confidential state department document \u2013 &quot;any military solution would result in unacceptable collateral damage&quot;. Barak&apos;s comments were one of many occasions in the last five years when Israeli leaders and officials have hammered home the message to the US that Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions pose an existential threat to Israel. Israel is widely believed to have an extensive nuclear arsenal but under its policy of ambiguity it has never been avowed. Unlike Iran it has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. Israel saw 2010 as a pivotal year. &quot;If the Iranians continue to protect and harden their nuclear sites it will be more difficult to target and damage them,&quot; the US embassy reported Israeli defence officials as saying in November 2009. In a discussion of the upcoming delivery of GBU-28 bunker-busting bombs to Israel it was noted that the transfer &quot;should be handled quietly to avoid allegations that the US government was helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran&quot;. Secret cables originating from the US embassy in Tel Aviv record the head of the Mossad secret service, Meir Dagan \u2013 along with senior military men and diplomats \u2013 repeatedly explaining to US visitors Israel&apos;s concerns and strategy for confronting Iran, including a readiness to take military action. By late 2009 the Mossad&apos;s view was that &quot;there is no reason to believe Iran will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 2010-2011, Iran will have the technological capability to build a nuclear weapon \u2013 essentially reducing the question of weaponising to a political decision&quot;. Dagan told a US politician in March 2005: &quot;Iran has decided to go nuclear and nothing will stop it.&quot; Israel and the US sometimes differed in their analysis, the Mossad chief conceded, but the facts themselves were &quot;not in dispute&quot;. US officials repeatedly expressed concern about conflicting assessments by their Israeli counterparts, some of whom admitted their own estimates should be treated with caution: one diplomat noted that Israeli assessments from 1993 onwards had predicted Iran would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 at the latest. &quot;We should recognise that Israeli intelligence briefings will understandably focus on worst-case scenarios and may not match current US government assessments,&quot; commented the US ambassador, Daniel Kurtzer. By the end of 2009 the view from Israeli military intelligence was that by 2012 Iran would be able to build one nuclear weapon within weeks and an arsenal in six months. &quot;It is unclear if the Israelis firmly believe this or are using worst-case estimates to raise greater urgency from the United States,&quot; a US diplomat responded. General Amos Yadlin, Israel&apos;s military intelligence chief, acknowledged differences with the US but said to a visiting congressman in summer 2009: &quot;Israel is not in a position to underestimate Iran and be surprised like the US was on 11 September 2001.&quot; The director general of the Israeli defence ministry said around the same time: &quot;All options must remain on the table.&quot; The official &quot;acknowledged that part of his job was ensuring Israel was ready to employ such an option, no matter how undesirable it may be&quot;. The Tel Aviv embassy has been sharply aware of differing views within Israel, noting in 2007 an increasing sense from diplomats and thinktank experts on Iran that military action must be a last resort. &quot;The IDF [Israel Defence Forces], however, strikes us as more inclined than ever to look toward a military strike, whether launched by Israel or by us, as the only way to destroy or even delay Iran&apos;s plans,&quot; it reported. Dagan, an army general appointed to head the Mossad by Ariel Sharon, was seen by American officials as a pessimist on the Iranian nuclear issue. But a White House interlocutor found him &quot;surprisingly optimistic&quot; in mid-2007 about the effect of two UN sanctions resolutions in &quot;stigmatising Iranian businesses and discouraging risk-averse Europeans from being connected with Iran&quot;. Shortly afterwards the Mossad chief briefed Nicholas Burns, then US under-secretary of state, on Israel&apos;s five-part strategy: \u2022 Bring Iran before the UN security council to pursue a third sanctions resolution; \u2022 &quot;Covert measures: Dagan and the under-secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting&quot;; \u2022 Counter-proliferation: prevent know-how and technology from making their way to Iran; \u2022 Sanctions \u2013 the biggest success so far. Three Iranian banks were on the verge of collapse. Financial sanctions were having a nationwide impact. \u2022 Regime change. Israel believed more should be done to foment this, possibly with the support of student democracy movements and ethnic groups such as the Azeris, Kurds and Baluchs. State department cables show Israel was sceptical about the effect of political pressure on Iran, especially by the EU. But it was maintaining &quot;low-profile diplomatic activities such as supplying IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] members with intelligence material related to the Iranian program&quot;. Israel&apos;s foreign ministry feared &quot;any overt Israeli pressure would backfire, leading to a surge of Arab support for Iran and focusing attention on Israel&apos;s own nuclear activities&quot; \u2013 a rare reference to a highly sensitive issue. In 2005 US diplomats were told by a senior military intelligence official that Israel did not know where all Iranian nuclear targets were located and that any attack would only delay, not end, the programme. Potential targets were well dispersed throughout the country, with several in built-up civilian areas. Public speculation about possible strikes focused on the differences from the Israeli attack on Iraq&apos;s Osirak reactor in 1981. &quot;In private,&quot; the US embassy reported, &quot;government officials have acknowledged that several factors would make any attack against Iran a much more difficult mission.&quot; It added: &quot;It may not be possible to detect preparations for any military strike. Air defence operations would pose nearly perfect cover for civil defence and air force activities preceding any attack. Due to both the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the government of Israel&apos;s near inability to prevent leaks, any attack order would be closely held.&quot; Dagan encouraged and commended US efforts to put pressure on Iranian banking facilities, forcing a move to banks in the Gulf states and the far east, and Swiss and Japanese banks forgoing business with Iran. The Mossad was keeping up pressure on this front, he revealed in 2006. By late 2008 the Mossad assessed that the economic problems Iran was experiencing as a result of sanctions were encouraging debate within the Iranian regime. &quot;The pressure is on,&quot; Dagan told the US treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Stuart Levey. &quot;But he could not estimate when Iran would hit the brink.&quot; Optimism on this front had faded by late 2009, when Tehran appeared to have regained full control after the popular unrest that followed that summer&apos;s disputed presidential elections. Amos Gilad, the influential political-military director of Israel&apos;s defence ministry, told a high-level US delegation that efforts to persuade Tehran to comply with international demands were its &quot;last chance&quot;. But Iran remained determined to reach the &quot;nuclear option&quot;, which Gilad described as intolerable. Iran, in the view of a Mossad representative at the meeting, could continue to &quot;play for time&quot; while pursuing its strategic objective to obtain a military nuclear capability. &quot;From Mossad&apos;s perspective there is no reason to believe Iran will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 2010-2011, Iran will have the technological capability to build a nuclear weapon \u2013 essentially reducing the question of weaponising to a political decision,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:20:28Z", "title": "Israel primed to attack a nuclear Iran", "sentences": ["Secret cables originating from the US embassy in Tel Aviv record the head of the Mossad secret service, Meir Dagan \u2013 along with senior military men and diplomats \u2013 repeatedly explaining to US visitors Israel&apos;s concerns and strategy for confronting Iran, including a readiness to take military action.", "The Tel Aviv embassy has been sharply aware of differing views within Israel, noting in 2007 an increasing sense from diplomats and thinktank experts on Iran that military action must be a last resort."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/israel-primed-attack-nuclear-iran"}, {"tags": ["The US embassy cables", "US news", "US foreign policy", "United Nations", "Saudi Arabia", "Iran", "Hillary Clinton", "North Korea", "WikiLeaks", "Press freedom", "Pakistan", "Italy", "Asia Pacific"], "article": " 7.15am:   Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available, in searchable format, to the public ... Everywhere there&apos;s a US post, there&apos;s a diplomatic scandal that will be revealed ... It&apos;s beautiful, and horrifying.  So wrote Bradley Manning, the 22-year-old former intelligence analyst, suspected of being behind the leak of more than 250,000 dispatches from US embassies around the world.  The first batch of those cables were released last night, so this is the morning for diplomatic heart attacks. And there will be more to come over the coming days. The focus of today&apos;s cables are the revelations of Saudi Arabia&apos;s desire to attack Iran; and details of US diplomats being ordered to spy on the United Nations leadership. Later today the Guardian will publish more details about what the cables say on North Korea.  The Guardian&apos;s editor, Alan Rusbridger, will be online at 4pm to take questions on the paper&apos;s decision to cover this story. Meanwhile, David Leigh tells the story of how the 250,000 cables were leaked, and an editor&apos;s note explains the Guardian&apos;s decisions on which cables to publish, which to redact and which to keep secret. Four other international media organisations which have also been working with WikiLeaks on the disclosures, the New York Times, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Der Spiegel, have been explaining their own approaches to the cables.  There has been a hostile response to the leaks from politicians around the world. You can follow the initial reaction in last night&apos;s live blog. US Republican representative Peter King, a member of the House homeland security committee said WikiLeaks should be treated as a terrorist organisation. Republican senator Lindsey Graham warned that &quot;WikiLeaks could have blood on their hands&quot;. Italy&apos;s foreign minister Franco Frattini described the leaks as the 9/11 of world diplomacy. US diplomats have been frantically trying to contain the damage.  Washington&apos;s new ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, published an article today in a Pakistan&apos;s English-language paper, the News, which aims to pre-empt unflattering references to the Pakistani government and its military.  Declan Walsh, our correspondent in Pakistan, writes:       Munter offers a coded half-apology for the content of the Pakistan files. &quot;Of course, even a solid relationship will have its ups and downs,&quot; he says, adding later that: &quot;Honest dialogue \u2013 within governments and between them \u2013 is part of the basic bargain of international relations; we couldn&apos;t maintain peace, security, and international stability without it. I&apos;m sure that Pakistan&apos;s ambassadors to the United States would say the same thing.&quot;  The cables likely to trouble Munter, which include allegations that the military is colluding with militant groups and unflattering pen portraits of leading politicians, were written by his predecessor Anne Patterson, a sharp, well-regarded diplomat who left Islamabad a few months ago. The Pakistan files are due to be published in the coming days.   7.23am: The UN has responded to evidence in cables that the US instructed its diplomats to spy on the UN leadership, including secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. In a carefully-worded three-point statement sent to the Guardian, spokesman Farhan Haq refused to address specifics, but he pointedly reminded the US that the UN is supposed to be treated as inviolable. Haq said:  1. The UN is not in a position to comment on the authenticity of the document purporting to request information-gathering activities on UN officials and activities. 2. The UN is by its very nature a transparent organisation that makes a great deal of information about its activities available to the public and member states. UN officials regularly meet representatives of member states to brief them on UN activities. 3. The UN Charter, the Headquarters Agreement and the 1946 Convention contain provisions relating to the privileges and immunities of the Organization. The UN relies on the adherence by member states to these various undertakings.   7.38am: Cables to be released in the coming days are expected to further strain US relations with Hamid Karzai&apos;s government in Afghanistan. In a teaser of what&apos;s to come, the New York Times says it will detail more US suspicions of corruption in the regime.     Gen Stanley McChrystal and US diplomat Karl Eikenberry appear together  at the House armed services committee. Gerald Herbert/AP    The US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, issued this statement in an attempt to placate Karzai and his government ahead of the leaks.   The owners of the WikiLeaks website claim to possess some 250,000 classified documents, many of which have been released to the media. These documents were purportedly downloaded from US Defence Department computers and appear to contain US diplomatic personnel&apos;s assessments of policies, negotiations, and leaders from countries around the world, including Afghanistan, as well as reports of private conversations with people inside and outside other governments. Whatever WikiLeaks&apos; motives are in publishing these documents, releasing them poses real risks to real people. We deeply regret the disclosure of information that was intended to be confidential. And we condemn it. For our part, the United States Government is committed to maintaining the security of our diplomatic communications and is taking steps to make sure they are kept in confidence. We are moving aggressively to make sure this kind of breach does not happen again. It is important to be clear that diplomatic personnel&apos;s internal reports do not represent a government&apos;s final determination of official foreign policy. In the United States, they are just one of many elements that shape our policies, which are ultimately set by the President and the Secretary of State. When it comes to Afghanistan, our policy has been made clear by President Obama in his speech on December 1, 2009 at West Point and again at the NATO Lisbon Summit just a few days ago. The United States is absolutely committed to building and strengthening a long-term partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan Government. Our shared goals do not change based on the release of purported diplomatic reporting from the past. Secretary Clinton and I have spoken with President Karzai and we are all committed, along with President Obama, to looking forward and focusing on those issues that are key to the success of the Afghan people and the security of the American people.   7.51am: Iraq&apos;s foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari, has joined in the international condemnation of the leaks, according to AP. He refused to discuss specifics, but called the leaks &quot;unhelpful and untimely&quot;.  8.00am: The Australian government has launched a &quot;whole-of-government&quot; investigation into WikiLeaks, whose founder Julian Assange, is an Australian citizen. Asked if Assange&apos;s passport would be removed, Australia&apos;s attorney general Robert McClelland said: &quot;We&apos;re waiting for advice from the agencies as to appropriate course of actions that may be taken in response.&quot;  8.09am: Iran&apos;s state-funded broadcaster Press TV has an interesting take on the revelations that Arab states want to attack Iran to thwart its nuclear programme. The cables revealed that Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah was recorded as having &quot;frequently exhorted the US to attack Iran to put an end to its nuclear weapons programme&quot;, one cable stated. &quot;He told you [Americans] to cut off the head of the snake,&quot; the cables state. Press TV&apos;s headline asks: &quot;Saudi king playing into US hands?&quot; It adds: &quot;Analysts believe the recent document release is a scenario carefully orchestrated by US intelligence agencies to deflect attention from the United States&apos; domestic problems, upset the situation in the region and lay the groundwork for military action against Iran.&quot;  8.30am: Britain&apos;s former ambassador to the United States, Sir Christopher Meyer, says it wrong to interpret the cables as a US instruction to spy on the UN. &quot;I think you have overwritten the story,&quot; Meyer told Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in an exchange on the Today programme. &quot;The story of Hillary Clinton ordering US diplomats to spy on members of the UN like Ban Ki-moon, is a serious misinterpretation,&quot; he said.  Rusbridger responded: &quot;We have different notions of what constitutes spying. If you go for the biometrical details, credit card numbers and passwords to private emails addresses, I call that spying.&quot; Rusbridger added: &quot;The diplomats that I have spoken to are astonished that this material was shared on a system which could be accessed by 2.5 million users.&quot;  Meyer also played down the leaks and said they wouldn&apos;t make any difference to the way diplomats behaved. &quot;So far on policy I don&apos;t see any revelations. What I do see is more embarrassment than damage. I&apos;m slightly underwhelmed by the content so far, although the fact and the size of the leak does raise very big issues about how you keep things confidential.&quot; But Meyer admitted that he didn&apos;t know that Saudi Arabia wanted to attack Iran.  8.43am: In another teaser of what&apos;s to come the New York Times said the cables reveal a &quot;dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel&quot;. It reports:  Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, &quot;if the local media got word of the fuel removal, &apos;they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons,&apos; he argued&quot;.  Pakistan has criticised the release of the cables. &quot;We condemn the irresponsible disclosure of sensitive official documents,&quot; its foreign ministry spokesman, Abdul Basit, said today.  8.59am: &quot;It&apos;s a bombshell,&quot; says the historian Timothy Garton-Ash in a Guardian video on the released of the cables. &quot;It&apos;s the most extraordinary window into how American diplomacy works.&quot; If you are new to the story the video provides an excellent primer on how the cables were leaked, how the Guardian handled them, and what the first batch of leaks contain.    \t \t \t \t \t     9.09am: Silvio Berlusconi laughed when told the content of the cables, according to Italian newspaper reports this morning, doubtless basedon a briefing by senior government officials, writes our Rome correspondent John Hooper.     John Hooper tiny Photograph: Guardian    The cables include a a senior US diplomat&apos;s assessment of the billionaire politician as &quot;feckless, vain and ineffective as a modern European leader&quot;. Even if Berlusconi did not take the leak seriously, others in Italy did. The prosecution service in Rome said it would be looking at the documents to see if their publication violated Italian official secrecy legislation.  The announcement followed a suggestion from Berlusconi&apos;s foreign minister, Franco Frattini, that the judiciary should take action. Italy was perhaps the country in which the impending release of the cables was viewed with greatest \u2013 or, at least, most obvious \u2013 alarm by the government. Frattini described the leaks as &quot;the 9/11 of world diplomacy&quot;. The head of his party in the lower house of parliament, Fabrizio Cicchitto, said the documents were representative of a newform of &quot;media terrorism&quot;.  9.21am: Establishment scorn for the leaks is summed up in a post on the Economist&apos;s Diplomacy in America blog. It dismisses them as gossip.  At this point, what WikiLeaks is doing seems like tattling: telling Sally what Billy said to Jane. It&apos;s sometimes possible that Sally really ought to know what Billy said to Jane, if Billy were engaged in some morally culpable deception. But in general, we frown on gossips. If there&apos;s something particularly damning in the diplomatic cables WikiLeaks has gotten a hold of, the organisation should bring together a board of experienced people with different perspectives to review the merits of releasing that particular cable. But simply grabbing as many diplomatic cables as you can get your hands on and making them public is not a socially worthy activity.   9.31am: Don&apos;t confuse WikiLeaks and Wikipedia. Larry Sanger, the co-founder of Wikipedia, strongly condemned the whistle-blowing site for releasing the cables.      In a tweet yesterday he wrote: &quot;@wikileaks Speaking as Wikipedia&apos;s co-founder, I consider you enemies of the U.S.--not just the government, but the people.&quot;  10.01am: The leak of the cables has divided newspaper commentators in the UK.  Writing in the Times Libby Purves says she is on the side &quot;horrified Washington diplomats&quot; [paywall].  The loose-lipped internet has done the world many favours, but there is a strong possibility that this latest release will do it none at all. If diplomats no longer dare to send undiplomatic, unvarnished truths to their governments on encrypted cables, the world&apos;s peace will be in more danger. Not less.  The Telegraph devotes lots of space to the revelations, but its deputy editor Benedict Brogan says they contain no surprises.  Effective diplomacy involves all the transgressions WikiLeaks is exposing. Embarrassment is just the consequence of exposure. Perhaps the more sophisticated response is to stand firm, to assume a degree of worldiness from those involved in the world of diplomacy (who will for example enjoy seeing the US Secretary of State squirming about her UN spying operation, but only because theirs hasn&apos;t been exposed as well), and to accept that occasional embarrassment is an occupational hazard in a 21st century marked by vast quantities of information circulating in all too accessible digital form.  But John Kampfner, chief executive of the Index on Censorship, provides a stout defence of free speech and WikiLeaks in the Independent.  The mainstream media in the UK are serial offenders. Newspapers that have no compunction about invasions of privacy or about shrill comment devote precious little time or energy to challenging authority through rigorous investigative journalism. Most political &quot;scoops&quot; are merely stories planted by politicians on pliant lobby hacks. Editors and senior journalists are habitually invited into MI5 and MI6 for briefings. These are affable occasions, often over lunch. There is no harm in that. What tends to happen, however, is that journalists are tickled pink by the attention. They love being invited to the &quot;D-notice&quot; committee to discuss how they can all behave &quot;responsibly&quot;. It makes them feel important. Many suspend their critical faculties as a result. Far from being &quot;feral beasts&quot;, to use Tony Blair&apos;s phrase, the British media are overly respectful of authority. Newspapers and broadcasters tend to be suspicious of those who do not play the game, people like Mr Assange who are awkward outsiders. Some editors are quite happy to help the authorities in their denunciations of him, partly out of revenge for not being in his inner circle. Rather than throwing stones, newspapers should be asking themselves why they did not have the wherewithal to hold truth to power.   10.18am: Like the Saudis, Tony Blair is also keen to use force to end Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. Blair&apos;s former spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, says the cables could open the way for a tougher stance against Tehran. In a new blogpost he writes:  I was left with the impression that anyone in the US system pushing for a hardening of the policy position vis a vis Iran would be able to build a lot of support for such a move. Fascinating too the view of Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak last year that if Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions were not checked soon, they would be developed to such an extent that a military response would be impossible because of collateral damage. Part of me thought that was just the Israelis doing their usual thing of trying to push the US harder than they want to go. Another part of me thought &apos;holy shit!&apos;   10.28am: The Saudi Gazette reports the leaks without mentioning Saudi Arabia&apos;s desire to attack Iran.  There has been no word from Saudi officials on the disclosures.  10.46am: So far the media in Iran has glossed over Arab aggression towards Tehran and focused instead on what the cables suggest about America&apos;s role in the post-election unrest last year, writes Saeed Kamali Dehghan.      An Iran watcher in Turkmenistan sent out a cable in June 2009, at the height of the post election turmoil, in which a prominent Iranian source is quoted condemning Ahmadinejad&apos;s victory as a &quot;coup d&apos;etat&quot; engineered by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  The source says opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi gained 26 million votes, 61% of the total, against &quot;a maximum of 4 to 5 million&quot; for Ahmadinejad. Alef.ir, a website affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards, said the cables showed &quot;America does not trust its agents in Iran&quot;.  In another article Alef.ir talks of &quot;America&apos;s post-election co-operation with Iranian post election rioters&quot;. &quot;The interesting parts of this documents are those which show that the rioters in the aftermath of the election are linked to the American diplomatic service and they have been consulted by them. For example an American contact in Ashghabad said: &quot;If they are mobilised and if the protesters &apos;shut down the country&apos; and don&apos;t go to work then the regime is forced to think again.&quot;   11.04am: Former Pakistani spy chief Hameed Gul has seized on the cables indicating a US desire to block Pakistan&apos;s nuclear programme, writes Saeed Shah.  Gul condemned as a fraud the first batch of WikiLeaks documents earlier this year, which reported that he remained active in directing the Afghan insurgency.  But speaking to the Guardian about the latest leak, he said: &quot;This confirms that the Americans haven&apos;t given up their pursuit, to try to snatch Pakistan&apos;s nuclear capability.&quot; Many in Pakistan sincerely believe that Washington&apos;s real plan for Pakistan is to somehow take away its nuclear weapons. The WikiLeaks cable from the then US ambassador in Islamabad, sent only last year, played directly to those fears. &quot;If the local media got word of the fuel removal, they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons,&quot; US ambassador Anne Patterson said in one cable, according to the New York Times.   11.28am: Der Speigel, one of the five media organisations including the Guardian to have had access to the cables, has a new roundup of the reaction. It says one of the few countries which may stand to benefit from the revelations appears to be Israel.   &quot;These (disclosures) don&apos;t hurt Israel at all -- perhaps the opposite,&quot; Giora Eiland, a former national security adviser to ex-prime ministers Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert, told Israeli radio. &quot;If there is something on the Iranian issue that, in my opinion, happens to help Israel, it is that these leaks show that Arab countries like Saudi Arabia are far more interested in Iran than they are in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;  It also quotes US senator Joseph Lieberman, chair of the Senate homeland security committee, calling for WikiLeaks to be shut down.  By disseminating these materials, WikiLeaks is putting at risk the lives and the freedom of countless Americans and non-Americans around the world. It is an outrageous, reckless and despicable action.   11.34am: The Chinese media has been banned from reporting the revelations, according to Al Jazeera English&apos;s correspondent in China, Melissa Chan.  11.39am: Downing Street has condemned WikiLeaks in a briefing with lobby journalists. It also said it expects several more days of disclosures, according to a tweet from the BBC&apos;s Laura Kuenssberg. Downing Street said the leaks had been damaging to national security, she told BBC News.  12.03pm: There&apos;s been lots of reaction all over the world so it&apos;s high time for a summary.      \u2022 Senior US politicians have launched a series of scathing attacks against WikiLeaks. US Republican congressman Peter King, a member of the House homeland security committee, said WikiLeaks should be treated as a terrorist organisation (7.15am). Senator Joseph Lieberman, chair of the Senate homeland security committee, said the leaks had put lives at risk.\u2022 Washington&apos;s new ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, offered a semi-apology for the cables in a newspaper article (7.15am). &quot;Of course, even a solid relationship will have its ups and downs,&quot; he wrote.\u2022 The UN pointedly reminded the US that the UN is supposed to be treated as inviolable, after the cables showed diplomats had been ordered to spy on the UN leadership (7.23am). Britain&apos;s former ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, said it was wrong to interpret the cables as an order to spy, a point challenged by Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger (8.30am).\u2022 Governments across the world have been taking action to contain the damage. Australia has launched an investigation on WikiLeaks, China has ordered local media not to report the revelations, and Downing Street says the leaks have damaged national security.\u2022 The Iranian media has glossed over the disclosure that several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, wanted to attack Tehran. It has focused instead on the suggestion of a US role in the post-election unrest last year. Saudi Arabia has stayed quiet.\u2022 Silvio Berlusconi laughed when he was told about the cables (9.09am).       12.47pm: Breaking news from Tehran: The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed the cables as US mischief making. He said the disclosure that Arab states wanted to attack Iran was not a genuine leak, but part of a US campaign of psychological warfare. More follows soon...  12.54pm: Here&apos;s more from Ahmadinejad:   Regional countries are all friends with each other. Such mischief will have no impact on the relations of countries. Some part of the American government produced these documents. We don&apos;t think this information was leaked. We think it was organised to be released on a regular basis and they are pursuing political goals.  The state news agency IRNA quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that the cables were not credible.  12.59pm: State-controlled Press TV has more from Ahmadinejad&apos;s press conference, where he claimed the cables about Iran were deliberately leaked by the US.  In response to a question by Press TV over the whistleblower website&apos;s &quot;leaks&quot;, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said, &quot;Let me first correct you. The material was not leaked, but rather released in an organised way.&quot;  &quot;The US administration released them and based on them they pass judgment \u2026 [The documents] have no legal value and will not have the political effect they seek,&quot; the Iranian chief executive added at the press briefing in Tehran.  Ahmadinejad stressed that the WikiLeaks &quot;game&quot; is &quot;not worth commenting upon and that no one would waste their time reviewing them&quot;.    1.22pm: Craig Murray, the political activist and former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, claims the British also tried to spy on the UN.  In a longer version of an article he posted on the Guardian&apos;s Comment is free website, he writes:  It is no surprise that US diplomats are complicit in spying on senior UN staff. The British do it too, and a very brave woman, Katherine Gunn, was sacked for trying to stop it. While the cables released so far contain nothing that will shock informed observers, one real impact will be the information available to the Arab peoples on how far they are betrayed by their US puppet leaders.   1.30pm: The French government described the leaks as an attack on democracy. Government spokesman and budget minister Fran\u00e7ois Baroin said France was made aware of the cables before their release and pledged to support the United States, a Nato ally, in defending diplomatic secrecy.  Speaking to Europe 1 Radio he said:  &quot;We are very supportive of the American administration in its efforts to avoid what not only damages countries&apos; authority and the quality of their services, but also endangers men and women working to defend their country.&quot; &quot;Authority and democratic sovereignty are threatened by such practices ... If there was such a thing as a French WikiLeaks, we would have to be inflexible (in dealing with it),&quot; he added.  1.38pm: In Iran it is not just Ahmadinejad who is claiming that leaks about Iran were a deliberate ploy by the Americans, writes Saeed Kamali Dehghan.      In a blogpost written before the president&apos;s press conference, Amin Alef, a prominent opposition blogger in Iran, wrote: &quot;It is possible that this leak of information is deliberate, so that the decision makers inside Iran can see that they are not only confronted by the US. The cables show that the US has played a role in holding back those who want to see a military strike against Iran.&quot;  1.51pm: The Guardian got hold of the cables from WikiLeaks and then deliberately shared them with the New York Times, according to a blogpost on the US news site the Cutline.  David Leigh, the Guardian&apos;s investigations executive editor, told The Cutline in an email that &quot;we got the cables from WL&quot; \u2013 meaning WikiLeaks \u2013 and &quot;we gave a copy to the NYT&quot;. It&apos;s not everyday that a newspaper gives valuable source material to a competitor. But Leigh explained in a second email that British law &quot;might have stopped us through injunctions [gag orders] if we were on our own.&quot;   2.15pm: The cables portray the US in a positive light on Iran, according to the BBC&apos;s world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds.   What the documents show in fact is not that the US secretly wants to go to war with Iran but that it has resisted pressure to do so from Israel and Arab leaders acting out of a coincidental common interest. This is very much in line with President Barack Obama&apos;s public diplomacy, which is to engage with Iran and, if necessary, to impose sanctions to try to get it to stop its nuclear activities. This it has done and the documents agree. The damage in this case is that the US has not protected the Gulf Arab leaders from having their opinion that Iran should be attacked made public. Yet for the rest of the world this is actually very important information. It might even give Iran pause for reflection.  But the spying disclosure are much more problematic for the Americans, he argues:  On the evidence so far there is really only one secret operation that appears to have been blown. That is an effort by US diplomats at the UN to get personal details (passwords and even frequent flyer numbers) about senior UN staff and permanent representatives on the Security Council. That indeed might come as something of a shock to the British ambassador there. He might have felt that his country&apos;s claimed &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US protected him. Not so, it appears.   2.27pm: The White House has just ordered all US agencies to review safeguards on classified information, according to AP. A security review is already underway at the US state department, it&apos;s spokesman told the Guardian.  2.47pm: The respected Middle East analyst Juan Cole says one of the cables is particularly revealing about fears in Israel of Jewish emigration if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.  The cable shed light on the thinking of high Israeli officials about why Israel cannot, as many US analysts have suggested, just live with an Iranian bomb if one is achieved. They believe that such a development would create a psychological nervousness in the Israeli public that would likely doom it as a Jewish state. What is being implicitly referred to is the expectation that if the Middle East turns even more dangerous for Israelis, such that they lose their status as the sole nuclear regional superpower, then Israeli Jews may well simply emigrate in large numbers. Over time, this development would ensure that Palestinian-Israelis, now over 20% of the population, become a plurality and even a majority.   3.09pm: The state department has just postponed a press conference with secretary of state Hillary Clinton. It was due to begin nowish, but it has been delayed until 6pm, our time.  3.16pm: Max Boot, senior fellow at the US foreign affairs thinktank the Council on Foreign Relations is appalled.  The WikiLeaks files only fill in details about what has generally already been known. Those details have the potential to cause acute embarrassment \u2014 or even end the lives of \u2014 those who have communicated with American soldiers or officials, but they do little to help the general public to understand what&apos;s going on...This is journalism as pure vandalism. If I were responsible, I would feel shame and embarrassment. But apparently, those healthy emotions are in short supply these days.   3.42pm: John Kornblum, former US ambassador in Berlin, tells Der Spiegel that the leaks will lead to less information sharing with the US.  Other governments will at first be cautious about sharing too much information with the United States. But perhaps reading the released telegrams will also help us all better to understand how difficult and frustrating diplomacy can be, why secrecy is necessary. Diplomats, like politicians and journalists, are also human. They too love to exchange gossip.  Richar Haass, president of Council on Foreign Relations makes a similar point.  The longer term damage may be more real. Foreign governments may think twice before sharing their secrets or even their candid judgments with American counterparts lest they read about them on the Internet. And American diplomats may be less less willing to commit their thoughts to paper. Such reticence will deprive policymakers of an important source of information and make decision making more ad hoc and less systematic that it needs to be.  But don&apos;t belief the US rhetoric about the risk of endangering lives, writes Nancy Youssef for McClatchy Newspapers.  Despite similar warnings ahead of the previous two massive releases of classified US intelligence reports by the website, US officials concede that they have no evidence to date that the documents led to anyone&apos;s death.   3.50pm: More tough-talking from the US authorities, this time from attorney general Eric Holder. He said there is an &quot;active and ongoing criminal investigation&quot; into the leaks.       3.52pm: The media commentator Roy Greenslade rounds-up the British press reaction to the disclosure. None of the UK front pages are quite as succinct as the New York post (left). It is one of the Washington-based Newseum&apos;s top ten front pages today.  4.02pm: Reuters has more on that security crackdown ordered by the US government. The new procedures would ensure &quot;that users do not have broader access than is necessary to do their jobs effectively, as well as implementation of restrictions on usage of, and removal media capabilities from, classified government directives,&quot; according to a directive from the Office of Management and Budget.      That&apos;s enough from me. Richard Adams, from our Washington office, is poised to take over. Thanks for all your comments. There&apos;ll be more from me tomorrow.       4.10pm: Thank you Matthew and good morning from Washington, where the latest WikiLeaks disclosures are the talk of the town \u2013 although the Washington Post rather bizarrely chose this headline for the front page splash in its print edition: Cables reveal intricacies of US diplomacy  4.20pm: A quick survey of the US cable news networks this morning suggests that Fox News is giving WikiLeaks the most airtime, especially over the revelations involving Iran and North Korea, which appears to be red meat to several of its commentators.      'This is not sabre-rattling': US attorney-general Eric Holder questioned about Wikileaks. Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP    4.28pm: More on Eric Holder, the US attorney-general, has just given a press conference (on an FBI sting that arrested a possible terrorist in Portland), during which he was asked about the investigation into the source of the WikiLeaks content. Holder said that &quot;there is an active, ongoing criminal investigation&quot; into the leaking of classified material and, more ominously, that some members of the media have not acted responsibly and will face &quot;real consequences&quot;. &quot;This is not sabre-rattling,&quot; he said, adding:  &quot;To the extent that we can find anybody who was involved in the breaking of American law, who put at risk the assets and the people I have described, they will be held responsible, they will be held accountable. &quot;To the extent that there are gaps in our laws, we will move to close those gaps, which is not to say that anybody at this point, because of their citizenship or residence, is not a target or a subject of an investigation that is ongoing.&quot;   4.34pm: The chorus of voices demanding some sort of retribution against WikiLeaks is coming most loudly from the Republicans and their allies. Earlier we mentioned New York congressman Peter King saying WikiLeaks should be treated as a terrorist organisation, and now Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the senior Republican on the House intelligence committee, called the release very damaging, telling AP:  &quot;The catastrophic issue here is just a breakdown in trust,&quot; [Hoekstra] said, adding that many other countries \u2013 allies and foes alike \u2013 are likely to ask, &apos;Can the United States be trusted? Can the United States keep a secret?&apos;&quot;   But foreign policy hawk Senator Joe Lieberman has walked back some of the more full-blooded rhetoric, arguing that designating WikiLeaks as a terrorist organisation would be a mistake:  &quot;Normally we reserve that designation for groups that fit the traditional definition of terrorism, which is that they are using violence to achieve a political end... While it&apos;s true that what WikiLeaks did may result in damage to some people ... it&apos;s not al-Qaida.&quot;  But Lieberman still supports shutting the site down, saying: &quot;It&apos;s a terrible thing that they, that WikiLeaks did. I hope we are doing everything we can to take down their website.&quot;  4.47pm: Fox News&apos;s London correspondent just did a round-up of the media coverage of WikiLeaks in the UK \u2013 and held up the front pages of the Times and the Independent. Bah.  5pm GMT: Waiting on a press conference by President Obama, to announce the details of what is expected to be a two-year pay freeze for US government employees, and it&apos;s possible he&apos;ll have something to say about the WikiLeaks cables, although he&apos;s not expected to take any questions. Otherwise, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, will be talking to the media at 12.30pm ET, and Hillary Clinton will be speaking on WikiLeaks from the State Department in Foggy Bottom at 1pm ET. OK, here&apos;s Obama, and first up a quip about his bust lip from Friday&apos;s basketball game. No one laughs.  5.10pm GMT: Obama is now speaking about the US&apos;s fiscal position and economy, and then announces the aforementioned pay freeze:  &quot;Today I&apos;m proposing a two-year pay freeze for all civilian Federal employees.... I want to be clear that this freeze does not apply to the men and women of our armed forces.&quot;  A few journalists shout &quot;Any reactions to WikiLeaks?&quot; as Obama walks off, but there&apos;s no response.  5.16pm GMT: If we had one of those red siren things that the Drudge Report has, it would be flashing here: stand by for incoming hot news.  5.22pm GMT: Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian&apos;s editor, is answering questions from readers about the WikiLeaks cables right here.      Prince Andrew spoke 'cockily' at a business brunch in Kyrgyzstan, a secret embassy cable claimed Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA    5.30pm GMT: A string of outrageous comments and asides by Prince Andrew appears in the leaked diplomatic cables \u2013 here&apos;s the latest from the Guardian&apos;s WikiLeaks coverage now online: &quot;Prince Andrew launched a scathing attack on British anti-corruption investigators, journalists and the French during an &apos;astonishingly candid&apos; performance at an official engagement that shocked a US diplomat.&quot;  Tatiana Gfoeller, Washington&apos;s ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, recorded in a secret cable that Andrew spoke &quot;cockily&quot; at the brunch with British and Canadian business people, leading a discussion that &quot;verged on the rude&quot;.  But the good news is that Prince Andrew was prepared to speak up in praise of British geography teachers. According to the cable from Gfoeller:  &quot;[O]ne British businessman noted that despite the &apos;overwhelming might of the American economy compared to ours&apos; the amount of American and British investment in Kyrgyzstan was similar. Snapped the duke: &apos;No surprise there. The Americans don&apos;t understand geography. Never have. In the UK, we have the best geography teachers in the world!&apos;&quot;  Here&apos;s a link to the original diplomatic cable.  5.45pm GMT: At last Sarah Palin speaks on the WikiLeaks revelations \u2013 well, she tweets on the subject. And being Sarah Palin, it&apos;s mainly about her:      &quot;Inexplicable: I recently won in court to stop my book America by Heart from being leaked, but US Govt can&apos;t stop Wikileaks&apos; treasonous act?&quot; Well, one is under the jurisdiction of the United States&apos; government and laws, and one isn&apos;t. Apart from that, inexplicable. But top marks for using this unlikely subject to plug your own book.  5.55pm GMT: Hillary Clinton is about to start speaking at the State department on the WikiLeaks US diplomatic cables \u2013 a tricky one for her to deal with since many of the cables from Washington go out under her name (even if she never laid eyes on them). It seems Clinton has been making a lot of late night phone calls to various heads of state.  6.14pm GMT: Hillary Clinton speaking now, saying that the WikiLeaks cable leaks imperils lives and US diplomatic efforts. Arguing that the revelations hurts diplomacy, Clinton said:  &quot;So let&apos;s be clear: this disclosure is not just an attack on America&apos;s foreign policy interests, it is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity. I am confident that the partnerships that the Obama administration has worked so hard to build will withstand this challenge.&quot; &quot;I will not comment on or confirm what are alleged to be stolen state department cables. But I can say that the US deeply regrets the disclosure of any information that was intended to be confidential, including private discussions between counter-parts or diplomats&apos; personal assesments or observations. I want to make clear that our official foreign policy is not set in these messages but here in Washington.&quot;   6.20pm GMT: Secretary Clinton still talking, saying that the US government was tightening its internal security &quot;so that this kind of breech does not and cannot happen again&quot;:  &quot;I would also add to the American people and to our friends and partners I want you to know that we are taking aggressive steps to hold responsible those who stole this information.&quot;  Clinton also raised the spectre of the cables exposing individuals to danger, saying:  &quot;US diplomats meet with local human rights workers, journalists, religious leaders and others outside of governments that offer their own candid insights... Revealing that person&apos;s identity could have serious repercussions: imprisonment, torture, even death.&quot;  Clinton went on to explain: &quot;Some may mistakenly applaud those responsible, so I want to set the record straight: there is nothing laudable about endangering innocent people and there is nothing brave about sabotaging the peaceful relations between nations on which our common security depends.&quot;  6.26pm GMT: Hillary Clinton is still pushing back against the fact of the leaks, and says she won&apos;t address individual topics raised by the &quot;stolen cables&quot; which she says were released &quot;without regard for the consequences&quot; for the entire international community. Disclosures such as these &quot;tear at the fabric of proper, responsible government&quot;, according to the secretary of state:  &quot;Every country, including the United States, must be able to have candid conversations about the people and nations with whom they deal. And every country, including the United States, must be able to have honest, private dialogue with other countries about issues of common concern. I know that diplomats around the world share this view... We count on the space of trust that confidentiality provides. When someone breaches that trust, we are all worse off.&quot;  Now there are questions from journalists.  6.30pm GMT: Asked if she&apos;s embarrassed by the leaks, Clinton waffles somewhat, before replying: &quot;It is imperative that we have candid reporting.... I think this is well understood in the diplomatic community as part of the give and take.&quot; Despite saying that she wouldn&apos;t discuss individual issues raised by the &quot;alleged stolen cables&quot;, Secretary Clinton can&apos;t resist taking the bait when asked about Iran, and uses the cables to make a point:  &quot;It should not be a surprise to anyone that Iran is a source of great concern... If anything, any of the comments that are being reported on, allegedly, from the cables, confirm the fact that Iran poses a very serious threat in the eyes of many of her neighbours and a serious concern far beyond the region. That is why the international community came together to pass the strongest possible sanctions against Iran.... If anyone reading the stories about these alleged cables thinks carefully, they will conclude that the concern about Iran is well founded and widely shared.&quot;  That&apos;s it, Clinton wraps it up after just two questions, and we&apos;ll have the report of the Guardian&apos;s Ewen MacAskill \u2013 who was at the Foggy Bottom briefing \u2013 to follow shortly.  6.46pm GMT: And now we go over to the White House briefing room, where Robert Gibbs is telling journalists how terrible these WikiLeaks cable disclosures are. &quot;The stealing of classified information and its dissemination is a crime,&quot; says Gibbs, having noted that President Obama &quot;was, as an understatement, not pleased with this information becoming public&quot;. And being the White House press corps, the next question is some Washington inside baseball about a meeting between Obama and Republican leaders tomorrow.  6.54pm GMT: Now the New York York Times editor Bill Kellher is answering questions online \u2013 and his batch of answers includes this nugget:  The London newspaper, The Guardian, gave us a copy of the archive, because they considered it a continuation of our collaboration on earlier WikiLeaks disclosures. (The Guardian initially asked us not to reveal that they were our source, but the paper&apos;s editor said on Sunday night that he was no longer concerned about anonymity.)   7.15pm GMT: The WikiLeaks cables have been studied intently in Israel, and so far it appears to be one country where the nation&apos;s diplomats haven&apos;t been dismayed or embarrassed by the leaks. Aluf Benn, one of Israel&apos;s leading columnists, writes in Ha&apos;aretz that the country&apos;s diplomats and leaders appear to have been saying in private the same things they have been saying in public:  The secret documents sent by the US Embassy in Tel Aviv show that the heads of the Israeli intelligence apparatus and the defense establishment refer to the same talking points when briefing American bureaucrats and congressional delegations as they do when speaking to journalists and Knesset members.... Thus Israel has no reason to be embarrassed by the leak, because there are no large gaps between what it said domestically and what it said for public consumption.   7.26pm GMT: The Guardian&apos;s John Hooper reports from Rome on the reaction to the US embassy cables and the mentions of Italy prime minister Silvio Berlusconi:     John Hooper tiny Photograph: Guardian    Silvio Berlusconi may \u2013 as earlier reported \u2013 have had a good old laugh about the WikiLeaks revelations when first told of their contents. But by this afternoon, his smile had vanished. On a visit to Libya, Italy&apos;s colourful prime minister flatly denied attending &quot;wild parties&quot;, as alleged by the US embassy in Rome, and said he had no interest in the opinions of &quot;third or fourth rank&quot; diplomats. In fact, the most damaging assessment of Italy&apos;s colourful prime minister came from the then US charge d&apos;affaires. Berlusconi asked reporters accompanying him to reflect on who might be paying the young women who have claimed to attend his parties, at least one of which is alleged to have ended in an erotic game known to participants as &quot;Bunga Bunga&quot;. The billionaire politician gave a rather different account of his social life, saying that &quot;Once a month, I give dinners in my houses where everything takes place in a proper, dignified and elegant fashion.&quot; Referring to a cable that described Berlusconi as often exhausted by parties that lasted into the early hours of the morning, the prime minister&apos;s lawyer, Niccolo Ghedini, said: &quot;If there were tiredness \u2013 and that isn&apos;t the way it is \u2013 then it could only be a corollary of the very intense political and governmental activity&quot;. Berlusconi&apos;s foreign minister, Franco Frattini, who yesterday described the release as a diplomatic 9/11, kept up his barrage of apocalyptic criticism today. &quot;WikiLeaks&quot;, he declared &quot;wants to destroy the world.&quot;       7.36pm GMT: Sarah Palin isn&apos;t the only person who can use Twitter to make a point about WikiLeaks. Here&apos;s a round-up of some of the more recent Twitterific responses. Susan Rice, the US&apos;s ambassador to the UN, tweets:  Our diplomats are just that, diplomats. I applaud their great skill and integrity. #cablegate  The Observer&apos;s Paul Harris:  Hillary Clinton says #wikileaks undermines US diplomacy. No, what undermines it is trying to steal Ban Ki Moon&apos;s frequent flyer number  Republican strategist and former Bush White House speechwriter Joshua Trevi\u00f1o:  I&apos;m not saying Julian Assange should be tormented by the world&apos;s bounty hunters until he meets death or justice. But I&apos;m not not saying it.  Christine O&apos;Donnell \u2013 remember her? \u2013 is still tweeting away:  Some may cringe when I say this but Hillary - You Go Girl! She&apos;s no Reagan yet her verbal lashing against wikileak is tough- watch out Obama!   8pm GMT: The Wall Street Journal reveals that it was offered a look at the US embassy cables by WikiLeaks but says it turned it down:  In a strategy aimed at raising its profile, WikiLeaks has been teaming up with news organizations on its leaks. Last week it offered The Wall Street Journal access to a portion of the documents it possesses if the Journal signed a confidentiality agreement. The Journal declined. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to agree to a set of pre-conditions related to the disclosure of the Wikileaks documents without even being given a broad understanding of what these documents contained,&quot; a spokeswoman for the paper said.   8.04pm GMT: Fox News&apos;s website asks its readers: &quot;Do You Think WikiLeaks Is a Terrorist Organization?&quot; And it seems that 68% of them do. &quot;This is not a scientific poll,&quot; the site warns.      Sarah Palin is beginning a 13-state book tour that may also mark the unofficial start of a 2012 presidential campaign. Photograph: Sara D Davis/Getty Images    8.28pm GMT: Hold the front page, Sarah Palin has written a Facebook post about the WikiLeaks affair. Basically, it&apos;s all the Obama administration&apos;s fault:  First and foremost, what steps were taken to stop Wikileaks director Julian Assange from distributing this highly sensitive classified material especially after he had already published material not once but twice in the previous months? Assange is not a &apos;journalist,&apos; any more than the &apos;editor&apos; of al Qaeda&apos;s new English-language magazine Inspire is a &apos;journalist.&apos; He is an anti-American operative with blood on his hands. His past posting of classified documents revealed the identity of more than 100 Afghan sources to the Taliban. Why was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders?  Palin does raise a good point:  Most importantly, serious questions must also be asked of the US intelligence system. How was it possible that a 22-year-old Private First Class could get unrestricted access to so much highly sensitive information? And how was it possible that he could copy and distribute these files without anyone noticing that security was compromised?              8.48pm GMT: The Guardian&apos;s Ewen MacAskill was at Hillary Clinton&apos;s press briefing this afternoon and has filed his piece, including this fascinating glimpse:  Although she started the press conference with a smile and even managed a joke during it \u2013 saying one of her foreign colleagues said she should see what they say privately about her \u2013 she looked tired after days talking to counterparts around the world, warning them of what might be coming and trying to soothe hurt feelings.   9.02pm GMT: The website Salon has a good round-up of the Top 10 most important WikiLeaks revelations \u2013 and it has another good piece about the Bush administration pressuring Germany not to prosecute CIA officials involved with torture and extraordinary rendition.      Private Bradley Manning: did he do it? Photograph: AP    9.24pm GMT: So how did Bradley Manning (allegedly) manage to get hold of so many classified documents, as Sarah Palin asked earlier? Here with the answer is the excellent Marc Ambinder, now at the National Journal, with a thorough must-read:  So how did Manning allegedly manage to get access to the diplomatic cables? They&apos;re transmitted via email in PDF form on a State Department network called ClassNet, but they&apos;re stored in PST form on servers and are searchable. If Manning&apos;s unit needed to know whether Iranian proxies had acquired some new weapon, the information might be contained within a diplomatic cable. All any analyst has to do is to download a PST file with the cables, unpack them, SNAP them up or down to a computer that is capable of interacting with a thumb drive or a burnable CD, and then erase the server logs that would have provided investigators with a road map of the analyst&apos;s activities. But analysts routinely download and access large files, so such behavior would not have been seen as unusual.  PST, PDF, thumb files, it&apos;s all very simple.  9.34pm GMT: The Guardian&apos;s Simon Tisdall has the US embassy cables revealing that China is ready to cut off North Korea \u2013 something with huge implications and possibly, after the UN spying charges, the biggest story to emerge so far from the WikiLeaks files:  China has signalled its readiness to accept Korean reunification and is privately distancing itself from the North Korean regime, according to leaked US embassy cables that reveal senior Beijing figures regard their official ally as a &quot;spoiled child&quot;.  The cables also reveal:  In highly sensitive discussions in February this year, the-then South Korean vice-foreign minister, Chun Yung-woo, told a US ambassador, Kathleen Stephens, that younger generation Chinese Communist party leaders no longer regarded North Korea as a useful or reliable ally and would not risk renewed armed conflict on the peninsula, according to a secret cable to Washington.   9.41pm GMT: The New York Times has an excellent round-up of all its coverage of the US embassy cables in its State&apos;s Secrets cache.  9.57pm GMT: A cute piece from Wired&apos;s Danger Room blog, which finds that several countries, including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, really want to buy Predator drones from the US. But there&apos;s a waiting list \u2013 and that upsets some people.  10.16pm GMT: Michael Calderone of The Cutline blog finds the Washington Post&apos;s editor Marcus Brauchli puzzled as to why the WikiLeakers don&apos;t offer his paper some of the good stuff:  &quot;You&apos;ll have to ask WikiLeaks or the consortium of media companies cooperating with them,&quot; Brauchli said in an email. &quot;There&apos;s certainly not a better platform for national-security and diplomatic news&quot;.   10.22pm GMT: I&apos;ve just seen Steve Bell&apos;s cartoon for tomorrow&apos;s Guardian \u2013 and it is very, very good indeed.  10.44pm: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has a long interview with Forbes \u2013 and warns that the next target will be a major US bank. Here&apos;s Andy Greenberg of Forbes:  In a rare interview, Assange tells Forbes that the release of Pentagon and State Department documents are just the beginning. His next target: big business. Early next year, Julian Assange says, a major American bank will suddenly find itself turned inside out. Tens of thousands of its internal documents will be exposed on Wikileaks.org with no polite requests for executives&apos; response or other forewarnings. The data dump will lay bare the finance firm&apos;s secrets on the Web for every customer, every competitor, every regulator to examine and pass judgment on.  The full interview with Assange is here.  11pm GMT: My colleague Oliver Burkeman alerts us to the thoughts of Rush Limbaugh, who is fascinated by the Wikileaks saga and what it tells us, according to the transcript of his syndicated radio show today:  Frankly, I find what&apos;s in this stuff interesting. I think it&apos;s more interesting than the news the networks come up with each and every day. Give me more of this stuff. For example, we have learned that the Saudis, our friends the Saudis, they&apos;re all ticked off at us because we won&apos;t go take out Iran.  Later, Rush responds to his listeners:  People in the email asked: &quot;Why do you like these leaked cables so much, Rush?&quot; Because they don&apos;t lie in diplomatic cables. The odds are that what we&apos;re getting here is the raw truth. People don&apos;t lie in these cables. These are not trumped up speeches, they&apos;re not written for the teleprompter. You don&apos;t write your cable on the teleprompter before you send it off. You write it up. I mean this stuff is better than People magazine. Well, people in the Clinton administration lied to their diaries, but for the most part people are not gonna lie to their diplomatic cables.   11.05pm GMT: More from Rush Limbaugh:  I hate the word Wiki. I know what it means. Wiki is a website where anybody can add to it, WikiLeaks, Wikipedia, Wiki, it does not sound like a manly word. Wiki. I think of candles. Wiki. Wiki. And then you look at this waif, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, and it just all kinda goes together, just does.   11.25pm GMT: Strangest story to come out of the WikiLeaks cables so far? That the US State Department asked its diplomats if Argentina&apos;s president Cristina Kirchner was on medication to calm herself down. The Guardian&apos;s Rory Carroll reports:  Clinton asked diplomats a series of questions in December last year which could infuriate Kirchner and sabotage a recent rapprochement between Argentina and America. In a section headed &quot;mental state and health&quot; she asked how the first lady-turned president was managing &quot;her nerves and anxiety&quot; in a blunt tone which suggested US concerns. &quot;How does stress affect her behaviour toward advisers and/or her decision-making? What steps does Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner or her advisers/handlers take in helping her deal with stress? Is she taking any medications?&quot;  That must be some of the &quot;conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity&quot; that Clinton highlighted in her attack on WikiLeaks this afternoon.  11.41pm GMT: Not surprisingly, El Pais leads its site with the revelation that the US State Department wanted to know about Argentina&apos;s Cristina Kirchner&apos;s mental health \u2013 and is able to flesh out the leaked cable with further background (in Spanish), placing the blame on the US&apos;s chief diplomat in the region, assistant secretary of state Arturo Valenzuela:  La demanda de informaci\u00f3n sobre la personalidad de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner se produjo poco despu\u00e9s de la visita del nuevo secretario de Estado adjunto para Am\u00e9rica, Arturo Valenzuela, a Buenos Aires (15 de diciembre de 2009), que se desarroll\u00f3 de forma poco afortunada.  El Pais also highlights some intriguing details in the cables about Argentina and Bolivia.  12 midnight GMT: Time to wrap things up for the evening. There will be plenty more to come tomorrow both in the Guardian and elsewhere, including the New York Times. \u2022 Full Guardian coverage \u2022 Full New York Times coverage The last word goes to the Guardian&apos;s Steve Bell.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-29T07:00:00Z", "title": "WikiLeaks US embassy cables: as it happened", "sentences": ["Aluf Benn, one of Israel&apos;s leading columnists, writes in Ha&apos;aretz that the country&apos;s diplomats and leaders appear to have been saying in private the same things they have been saying in public:  The secret documents sent by the US Embassy in Tel Aviv show that the heads of the Israeli intelligence apparatus and the defense establishment refer to the same talking points when briefing American bureaucrats and congressional delegations as they do when speaking to journalists and Knesset members...."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-us-embassy-cables-live-updates"}, {"tags": ["The US embassy cables", "World news", "US news", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "WikiLeaks"], "article": "Gary Younge: &apos;Leaks reveal how tight room for manoeuvre can be&apos;      The behind-the-scenes revelations about American diplomacy really only shock three groups of people. The first is those who believe the US is a force for unalloyed good in the world with a foreign policy rooted in principle rather than pragmatism. Even after the past nine years the number of those in that category is higher than many would think. For them, the problem with the US invading Iraq was not that it broke international law on a false pretext, leaving thousands dead or displaced, but that it lost. The lesson they have drawn is not that the US needs to adopt more subtle methods than bombing, torturing and invading but that not all of the world is ready for freedom. Last month, during the final debate between the Colorado Senatorial candidates, Republican, Ken Buck, said: &quot;It&apos;s a fundamental mistake to assume that a people as backward as the Afghans are going to be able to build the industrialised nation and the democracy that it takes to be able to achieve what we would consider a western-style democracy.&quot; The second group is those who believe that the US can call the shots unilaterally and need not care about whatever anyone else thinks. This has long been acknowledged by the country&apos;s intelligence forces. &quot;Owing to the relative decline of its economic and, to a lesser extent, military power, the US will no longer have the same flexibility in choosing among as many policy options,&quot; concluded the National Intelligence Council (which co-ordinates analysis from all US intelligence agencies) in early 2009. The leaks reveal, among other things, just how tight the room for manoeuvre can be in the current period. They show the US attempting to trade a presidential visit to Slovenia in return for the Slovenes taking a Guant\u00e1namo prisoner and expose its inability to prevent Syrians arming Hezbollah in Lebanon. These first two may appear like straw men. But in the domestic political arena it is a bold national politician who insists that the US is anything but unrivalled in might and morality. And after the Republican victories in the mid-term elections, they will now need to be bolder still. But, finally, the third group: those on the left, who mistook American diplomacy for acts of either unalloyed evil or delusion. News of America resisting calls from the Arab world to bomb Iran simply show it is more than capable of a rational appraisal in global affairs. The diplomats in question, charged with looking after their national interests, understand that such an attack would not be in the country&apos;s interests in the region. These were probably the same diplomats who desperately tried to dissuade George Bush from invading Iraq. The state department, lest we forget, voiced internal opposition to the war and predicted many of the things that went wrong. If anything, what the leaks tell us is, in light of recent events, is that we should not confuse America&apos;s domestic politics with its diplomatic engagements; nor should we assume that its foreign and military actions are necessarily guided by its diplomatic assessments. Seumas Milne: &apos;Global mobilisation of US power against Iran is an ominous thread&apos;      The relentless global mobilisation of US power against Iran \u2013 and of Washington-backed Arab autocracies and dictatorships for an American attack on Tehran \u2013 is an ominous thread that runs through thousands of the leaked state department WikiLeaks cables published in the Guardian. Not only do they underline the danger represented by the threat of aggression against Iran over its nuclear programme, which of course Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes only; but the repeated private demands by the Saudi king Abdullah to &quot;cut off the head of the snake&quot; \u2013 backed up by Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain (and, of course, Israel) \u2013 also serve to drive home the utterly unrepresentative nature of the client Arab regimes that underpin western power in the Middle East. While the Arab rulers fear Iran and want the US to attack it, the majority of their people support Iran&apos;s nuclear programme and believe it would be &quot;positive&quot; for the region if Iran did develop nuclear weapons \u2013 according to the most recent poll carried out by the US Zogby polling organisation and Maryland University in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and other pro-western Arab states. Asked which countries threatened their security, 88% replied Israel, 77% the US and just 10% Iran. No doubt Saudi and Egyptian leaders will be more careful about what they say to American ambassadors in future. But then they&apos;re not the only ones. Now it&apos;s emerged from the WikiLeaks cables that Hillary Clinton has instructed US embassy staff around the world to spy on UN staff and leaders, as well as a wide range of political, business and religious figures, down to their biometric and credit card details. Plenty of others who meet US diplomats are likely to keep a closer eye on their pockets. Craig Murray: &apos;The best policy advice is not shielded from peer review&apos;     Former ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray  before speaking about the moral issues concerning euthanasia, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival 2008.  Edinburgh, Scotland, UK  12/8/08 COPYRIGHT PHOTO BY MURDO MACLEOD All Rights Reserved Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The securitocracy has been out in force in the media, attacking WikiLeaks and repeating their well-worn mantra: government secrecy is essential to keep us all safe. It is seriously argued that ambassadors will not in future give candid advice if there is a chance that that advice might become public. In the past 12 hours I have heard this remarkable proposition put forward on five different television networks, without anybody challenging it. I was wearily familiar with these pro-secrecy arguments in more than 20 years as a British diplomat, six of them in the senior management structure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Put it another way and the cracks start to appear. The best advice is advice you would not be prepared to defend in public. Really? Why? In today&apos;s globalised world, embassies are not a unique source of expertise. Often, expatriate, academic and commercial organisations are a lot better informed. The best policy advice is not advice that is shielded from peer review. What the establishment mean is that ambassadors should be free to recommend things that the general public would view with deep opprobrium, without any danger of being found out. But should they really be allowed to do that, in a democracy? I have never understood why it is felt that behaviours that would be considered reprehensible in private or even commercial life \u2013 like lying, or saying one thing to one person and the opposite to another person \u2013 should be considered acceptable, or even praiseworthy, in diplomacy. When ambassador to Uzbekistan, I was rebuked by the then head of the diplomatic service for reporting to London by unclassified email the details of dreadful human rights abuses by the Uzbek government. The FCO were concerned that the Uzbeks, who were intercepting our communications, would discover that I disapproved of their human rights violations. This might endanger the Uzbek alliance with British forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. For the FCO, diplomacy is synonymous with duplicity. Among British diplomats, this belief that their profession exempts them from the normal constraints of decent behaviour amounts to a cult of Machiavellianism, a pride in their own amorality. It is reinforced by their narrow social origins \u2013 still in 2010, 80% of British ambassadors went to private schools. As a group, they view themselves as ultra-intelligent Nietzschean supermen, above normal morality. Some web commenters have noted that the released diplomatic cables reflect the US&apos;s political agenda, and there is even a wedge of the blogosphere suggesting that WikiLeaks is therefore a CIA front. This is nonsense. Of course the documents reflect the US view \u2013 they are official US government communications. What they show is something I witnessed personally, that diplomats as a class very seldom tell unpalatable truths to politicians, but rather report and reinforce what their masters want to hear, in the hope of receiving preferment. There is therefore a huge amount about Iran&apos;s putative nuclear arsenal and an exaggeration of Iran&apos;s warhead delivery capability. But there is nothing about Israel&apos;s massive nuclear arsenal. That is not because WikiLeaks has censored criticism of Israel. It is because any US diplomat who made an honest and open assessment of Israeli crimes would very quickly be an unemployed ex-diplomat. \u2022 Craig Murray is a political activist and former ambassador to Uzbekistan Richard Norton-Taylor: &apos;Most diplomats and spies will see the leaks as embarrassing more than anything else&apos;      An ambassador is a man of virtue sent abroad to lie for his country. To lie, but not to spy, a much more dangerous activity, as the 16th century wit who penned the well-known adage would have known only too well. The WikiLeaks cables suggest the lines between diplomacy and spying have become blurred. &quot;The intelligence community relies on state [department] reporting officers for much of the biographical information collected wordwide,&quot; says one of cables. What appears to have shocked most journalist commentators is the apparently brazen and unembarrassed request for detailed personal information, including credit card numbers and frequent flyer account numbers, of senior UN officials. Will the US ever learn? Shortly before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, a conscientious GCHQ translator, Katharine Gun, leaked a memo from the National Security Agency urging the British to help bug the phones of the UN. It caused a storm in the media. Intelligence agencies and diplomats eager for recognition demand more and more information; the question is, is it useful. The irony is that these 250,000 or so cables, subjected to varying degrees of classification (but not the highest, there are no intelligence agency cables here) were distributed to 2.5 million people because of the failure to share relevant information before the 9/11 attacks. US agencies are flooded with information as it is \u2013 what good would it really achieve getting the flyer accounts of a UN official? One test is to consider whether the information in the cables contain such information which could \u2013 or should \u2013 change US policy. Elements in the Iranian, Russian and Chinese regimes, will make use of these leaks. But in the end, most diplomats and spies will see them as simply embarrassing, hugely so but embarrassing more than anything else. The work of US diplomats will prove more difficult, perhaps for a long time to come. The real spies are likely to carry on, calmly, and hidden, as before. Juan Cole: &apos;The yield of the documents is actually thin&apos;      The WikiLeaks revelation that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia repeatedly urged Washington to &quot;cut off the head of the snake&quot; and launch a surgical air strike on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities sounds more sensational than it actually is. The elderly monarch risked nothing by his urgings, which put all the onus, and the possible backlash, on the United States. It is no secret that the Sunni Arab leaders in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf have been alarmed by the rise of Iran as a regional power. That rise has taken place for three reasons. First, the worrisome deterioration in the condition of stateless Palestinians under rightwing governments of Israel since 2001, and that country&apos;s increasing belligerence toward neighbours, as with the 2006 Lebanon war, have inflamed passions throughout the region, allowing Iran to position itself as a champion of the weak. Second, the Bush administration destroyed the Sunni Arabs&apos; bulwark against Iran, the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and brought pro-Iranian Shias to power in Baghdad. Third, Iran has made progress in its nuclear enrichment program. There is no evidence that the Iranians have a nuclear weapons program, but even for Iran to possess the knowledge of how to close the fuel cycle and enrich to the level needed for a bomb would change the power equation in the Middle East. This development would give Iran the &quot;Japan option&quot; of at any time going for broke to put together a warhead. The aged Saudi monarch has been pursuing an unrealistic policy of trying to put the big blue Iranian genie back in its lantern. But note that King Abdullah has also hosted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Riyadh and has kept a dialogue going with Tehran, buttering his bread on both sides. Riyadh is not alone in its hysteria. But although Arab officials like Prince Turki al-Kabir of the Saudi foreign ministry threaten the US with a nuclear arms race if Iran gets a warhead, there is no reason to take such assertions as more than a way to put pressure on the Pentagon to do the bidding of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. If the US is wise, it will avoid being stampeded into yet another ruinous Middle Eastern war based on exaggerated fears about alleged weapons programs. Israel already has a nuclear arsenal, which is what is fuelling the current arms race in the region, and if Arab states don&apos;t care enough about Tel Aviv&apos;s nuclear weapons to seek atomic bombs themselves, it is hard to see how Iran&apos;s civilian research program could induce them to do so. Despite the breathless headlines they generated, the yield of the documents is actually thin. The most populous and militarily most important Arab state, Egypt, appears not to have been among those urging military action. There is no sign in the diplomatic cables of any practical steps toward an Arab attack on Iran, no evidence of logistical or military preparations. At most there is high-level gossip in Arab capitals that something should be done, and by someone else. In any case, if this is the anti-Iranian Arab axis, Tehran can sleep peacefully at night. \u2022 Juan Cole is the Richard P Mitchell collegiate professor of history at the University of Michigan and author of Engaging the Muslim World Abbas Edalat and Phil Wilayto: &apos;Iran&apos;s independent stance is hugely popular among Arabs&apos;  The latest batch of WikiLeaks revelations give the impression that it is the Arab states that are most energetically pressuring the US to attack Iran. That&apos;s definitely putting the cart before the horse. In the first place, the Arab governments mentioned as being hostile to Iran \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 are all undemocratic, unpopular regimes that depend on US support to stay in power. As such, they seem to have absorbed the US claims that Iran is the region&apos;s greatest threat to peace. A completely different view, however, is held by these governments&apos; own subjects, among whom Iran&apos;s independent stance is hugely popular. According to a recent poll that asked Arab people in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates to name two countries they thought were the greatest threat to the region, 88% stated Israel, 77% stated the US and only 10% mentioned Iran. Of course, no Arab country has the military capability of launching a serious attack against Iran. Only Israel has that ability in the region, but Israel is dependent for its continued existence on its $3bn in annual US subsidies and its US-supplied diplomatic firewall in the UN security council. There is almost no way Israel could attack Iran unless it had first been given a green light from Washington or because it had calculated the US would have no choice but to back it up with military force. Without a doubt, Iran does represent a threat to US imperial interests. Iran takes no orders from Washington, its natural resources are off-limits to Western corporations and it has no love for the corrupt, pro-Western governments that dominate the region. As such, it represents an obstacle to US hegemony.  To demonise Iran, the US has for eight years promoted the myth of an Iranian nuclear weapons programme, much as it demonised Iraq through its false charges about weapons of mass destruction. And while this myth has formed the basis for four sets of UN sanctions against Iran, the US has never provided the first shred of proof and its &quot;evidence&quot; of Iran&apos;s nuclear weapons studies has now been shown to be simply a fabrication.  No, the principal threat to Iran remains the United States, which for years, prodded by nuclear-armed Israel, has declared that &quot;all options are on the table.&quot; On 5 December, Iran is scheduled to begin revived negotiations with the five permanent UN security council members, plus Germany. This would be an ideal time for Washington to make the following declaration: that it will not attack Iran, will not allow an attack by Israel, will end all sanctions against Iran, will recognise Iran&apos;s right under the UN&apos;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to pursue peaceful nuclear power, will return Iran&apos;s nuclear file from the UN Security Council to the IAEA in exchange for Iran&apos;s stated pledge to allow the intrusive inspections of the IAEA&apos;s Additional Protocol and will agree to discuss all outstanding differences in a spirit of mutual respect. \u2022 Abbas Edalat is founder of the Campaign Against Sanctions &amp; Military Intervention in Iran.

I was on my first trip to the region, back in the early 90s, in\u00a0the Syrian capital of Damascus. After a nice chat, my taxi driver must have decided I wasn&apos;t Mukhabarat or in another way spying for the many intelligence agencies in\u00a0the country, and told me about a political prisoner who complains about the harsh torture he has to endure. His torturers burst out laughing: &quot;Where do you think you are, Sweden?&quot; The political prisoner returns to his cell very angry, and complains to the other inmates about this disrespectful answer. The inmates burst out laughing: &quot;Where do you think you are, Sweden?&quot; A pretty lame joke, I admit, but I was in a state of confusion. Arabs who tell jokes\u2026 From Hollywood to CNN, I had come to know Arabs as oversexed oil sheikhs, tenacious warriors, mad terrorists, crazy crowds chanting &quot;death to&quot; something, and as interchangeable wailing victims. To encounter Arabs as ordinary people who trade sarcastic jokes. That was new. Anthropologists think of a good joke as a successful virus. If it catches on, it may tell you something valuable about the host&apos;s immune system. Most jokes I picked up in the Arab world dealt with the stupidity of the dictator and his entourage, and on the supposed easy morals of the dictator&apos;s partner. The two strands come together in this one from the time Arafat was still around: A Palestinian policeman is patrolling the beach\u00a0of Gaza at night when he stumbles on a\u00a0couple making out. He is about to arrest them\u00a0when he realises it is Arafat and his wife Suha. &quot;So sorry, rayyis,&quot; the policeman fumbles as\u00a0he tries to get away as fast as he can. But Arafat\u00a0is\u00a0adamant: &quot;Arrest me! I have just launched\u00a0an\u00a0anti-corruption campaign and\u00a0that&apos;s\u00a0how the\u00a0rule\u00a0of law works \u2013 no special\u00a0cases.&quot; Reluctantly, the policeman takes Arafat and Suha to the station where the Palestinian leader receives a 100 shekel fine. Suha\u00a0must pay 200. &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; asks Arafat. Comes the answer: &quot;For you it was a first offence.&quot; People in the Arab world have to be careful about telling such jokes, and also about laughing at them. You need to make sure the joker is not in\u00a0fact an agent provocateur for the secret service.\u00a0But people joke anyway, and this resilience is a great thing to watch, whether the joke is good or bad. I have always felt that the foreign pages of a good newspaper should feature a jokes section from all over the world as a humanising counterweight to all the reports that stress the differences between there and here. Jokes make you realise: of course, these are people like me. They have to survive in very different circumstances, but they are people all the same. A\u00a0reporter friend who works in Afghanistan tells me that underneath their burqas Afghan women trade very cruel jokes about the size of the male reproductive organ of the Taliban. But not all jokes are about sex or the ineptitude of the leadership. Each country has its region to pick on, the way people in my native Holland take it out on the Belgians, and vice versa. Egyptians make fun of people from the south who get portrayed as proud and backward. Syrians make jokes at the expense of people from the city of Homs, in Baghdad it&apos;s the Dulaymi people from the Anbar province, and Palestinians laugh about inhabitants of Hebron, who are said to be stupid and out of their depth. That is perhaps the most striking thing about humour in the Middle East. Most of the time the joke is not on the enemy. As far as I could tell, Palestinians rarely make fun of Jewish settlers, nor the other way around. Instead, people seem to prefer irony, and my favourite joke is an example: Two Israelis are sitting on the beach in Tel Aviv, reading. One has got a quality newspaper, the other an antisemitic rag. &quot;Why on earth are you reading that?&quot; one asks. &quot;I used to read a\u00a0quality paper like you,&quot; the other sighs, &quot;but I couldn&apos;t handle it any more \u2013 the rockets from Gaza and Hezbollah getting stronger every day and the Iranian nuclear programme and the suffering economy and growing antisemitism across Europe\u2026&quot; He points to the antisemitic rag. &quot;Now\u00a0I read this and I feel much better. Turns out\u00a0there&apos;s actually a Jewish global conspiracy and we control the entire world.&quot; Uruguay The rest of South America takes the\u00a0piss out of vain, metrosexual Argentinian men. I&apos;ve heard it all\u00a0over, but it&apos;s most popular in Uruguay: A girl meets an Argentinian man on the street\u00a0and asks him for a light. He pats his trousers, chest and back pockets. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he says, &quot;I don&apos;t have one but, wow, do I have a great\u00a0body or what?&quot; Rory Carroll Norway For Norwegians, it&apos;s the Swedes. The\u00a0Swedes were for centuries the\u00a0wealthier and more successful Scandinavian sibling, but with the discovery of North Sea oil in the late 1960s, the\u00a0tables turned: A Norwegian lorry driver was transporting a load of penguins to the aquarium in Bergen. In the middle of a mountain pass, his lorry broke down, and while he was standing by the side of the road, a\u00a0Swedish lorry driver pulled over. The Swede asked if he could help, and the Norwegian asked if he could take the penguins to the aquarium. The next day, the Norwegian made it to Bergen. At the first stop light, he caught sight of the Swede standing at the junction with the penguins in a row behind him, waiting on the light. &quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; the Norwegian asked. &quot;You were supposed to take those penguins to the aquarium.&quot; The Swede replied, &quot;That was yesterday. Today I&apos;m taking them to the movies.&quot; Ian MacDougall US This generic regional joke works for anywhere: &quot;Why wasn&apos;t Jesus born in West Virginia? Because God couldn&apos;t find three wise men and a\u00a0virgin.&quot; Oliver Burkeman Pakistan Most current jokes around here centre on President Zardari, who has\u00a0an unenviable reputation for corruption: Robber: &quot;Give me all your money.&quot; Zardari: &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; Robber: &quot;No.&quot; Zardari: &quot;I am Asif Ali Zardari, president of\u00a0Pakistan.&quot; Robber: &quot;OK, give me all my\u00a0money.&quot;Declan Walsh Mexico The classic one many Mexicans tell is about a\u00a0Mexican fisherman walking up the beach with a\u00a0bucket full of crabs: &quot;You&apos;d better put a lid or a net on that or they&apos;ll get out,&quot; a passing gringo says. &quot;Oh, don&apos;t worry,&quot; says the fisherman. &quot;They&apos;re Mexican crabs. If one of them tries to crawl up\u00a0the\u00a0side, the rest will pull it back down.&quot; Johanna Tuckman Iceland A Norwegian, a Faroese and an Icelander are about to be executed. Each one gets a final wish.\u00a0The Faroese asks for a final feast of sour shark and dried whalemeat for everyone. The Icelander asks to be allowed to compose an epic\u00a0poem in the old style about how cruelly he\u00a0is\u00a0being treated and about how great Iceland is.\u00a0The Norwegian thinks for a while, and then says: &quot;Can I be executed before the poem is read\u00a0and the food is served?&quot; Valur Gunnarsson  Nigeria A man dies and goes to hell. Once there, he finds that there is a different hell for each country, so he tries to seek out the least painful one. At the door to German Hell, he is\u00a0told: &quot;First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they\u00a0lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the German devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day.&quot; He does not like the sound of that, so he checks out American Hell, Russian Hell and many more. They are all similarly gruesome. However, at Nigerian Hell a long line of people is waiting to get\u00a0in. Amazed, he asks, &quot;What do they do here?&quot; He is told: &quot;First they put you in an electric chair for an hour. Then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. Then the Nigerian devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day.&quot; &quot;But that&apos;s the same as the others,&quot; says the man. &quot;Why are so many people waiting to get in?&quot; &quot;Because of the power cuts, the electric chair does not work. The nails were paid for but never supplied, so the bed is comfortable. And the Nigerian devil used to be a civil servant, so he comes in, signs his time sheet and goes back home for private business.&quot; Tolu Ogunlesi Colombia The joke I like reflects the dark humour of Colombians about their situation. With the second-highest rate of internally displaced people\u00a0in\u00a0the world, and being the most unequal\u00a0country in South America, many people\u00a0beg or sell goods at traffic lights: Have you heard the mayor&apos;s new jobs plan?

A\u00a0policeman pulls him over and asks, &quot;Sir, have you been drinking?&quot; Van der Merwe decides to admit it: &quot;Yes, I have.&quot; &quot;Did you know,&quot; the cop says, &quot;that at the last traffic roundabout, your wife fell out of the car?&quot; &quot;Oh, thank God,&quot; says Van der Merwe. &quot;I thought I&apos;d gone deaf.&quot; David Smith Australia Two Aussies are adrift in a lifeboat. While rummaging through the boat&apos;s provisions, one\u00a0of\u00a0them finds an old lamp. He rubs it\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0genie appears. The genie grants\u00a0them one wish only. Without giving it much thought, the lamp finder\u00a0says, &quot;Turn the ocean into VB\u00a0Beer!&quot;     Illustration by John Holcroft for the Guardian    The genie claps his hands with a deafening crash, and the entire sea turns into beer. The genie disappears and only the gentle\u00a0lapping of\u00a0beer on the hull breaks the stillness as the two men consider their circumstances. The second Aussie turns to the first and says, &quot;Nice going, mate!

So many inventions! Such landscapes! He bought a box of matches and sent them to his wife, Maria, back in Portugal. Months later he received a letter: &quot;Joao, I loved the presents, thanks. But the box of matches didn&apos;t work quite like you said they would.&quot; Surprised, Joao replied that day: &quot;Maria, I can&apos;t understand it! I tested them all before I sent them.&quot; Tom Phillips France     Illustration by John Holcroft for the Guardian    The French joke about the Belgians as the English mock the Irish: A Belgian puts a coin in a vending machine and gets a Coca-Cola. He\u00a0puts a second coin in and gets a\u00a0second Coca-Cola. He puts a third coin in\u2026 and so on. A Frenchman standing behind him waiting says, &quot;You certainly like Coca-Cola.&quot; &quot;Why stop playing when I&apos;m winning,&quot; replies the Belgian. Kim Willsher Italy Italians tell jokes about their carabinieri military policemen, who have a flame emblem on the front of their hats. More jokes are told about them\u00a0in Italy than about any ethnic or\u00a0regional group. Many carabinieri traditionally hail from\u00a0the south, so there is a dose of northern prejudice in there. The carabinieri also represent\u00a0the Italian state, which is often a\u00a0laughing stock: Why did the carabinieri design the flame leaning to the left? So they don&apos;t burn their hands when\u00a0they salute.

The American puts\u00a0his arm out of the window and recoils: &quot;Sheesh, it&apos;s hot out there. Must be somewhere over the tropics.&quot; The Japanese puts his hand out\u00a0and quickly pulls it back in, saying, &quot;Too cold\u00a0for me \u2013 my guess is it&apos;s the South Pole.&quot; The\u00a0Bangladeshi puts his hand outside and keeps\u00a0it there for a while before bringing it inside\u00a0and settling back into his seat. &quot;Gulistan,\u00a0Dhaka,&quot; he says.

Xan\u00a0Rice Congo This one is about how Congo&apos;s elite\u00a0has underdeveloped this vast, poor, mineral-rich country: A Congolese minister visited a Cuban minister, who invited him to his stunning mansion. The\u00a0Congolese minister asked how he&apos;d done it.\u00a0The Cuban minister took the Congolese minister to the window and pointed outside to\u00a0a\u00a0sparkling strip of tarmac. &quot;You see that road?\u00a0Well, my ministry oversaw it. And I\u00a0took 10% for myself.&quot; The Congolese minister nodded thoughtfully. Years later, the Cuban minister paid a return visit. The Congolese minister couldn&apos;t wait to\u00a0greet him\u00a0and take him to his mansion, which\u00a0was\u00a0even more sumptuous than the one\u00a0he\u00a0had visited years before. &quot;Wow, how did\u00a0you\u00a0do this?&quot; asked the Cuban minister. The\u00a0Congolese minister took him to the window\u00a0and\u00a0pointed out\u00a0at the overgrown scrubland\u00a0that\u00a0filled the view: &quot;I commissioned a\u00a0road, too\u00a0\u2013 100%!&quot; Katrina Manson Iran Jokes in Iran are about ethnic minorities like Turks and Abadani.

Kate Connolly New Zealand An Australian rugby fan, a South African rugby fan\u00a0and a New Zealand rugby fan are all in Saudi Arabia, sharing a smuggled crate of booze when Saudi police rush in and arrest them. The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia, so for consuming the booze they are all sentenced to death. However, after\u00a0many months and with the help of good\u00a0lawyers, they are able successfully to appeal their sentences down to life imprisonment. By a stroke of luck, it was a\u00a0Saudi national holiday the day their trial finished, and the benevolent sheikh decided they could be released after receiving just 20 lashes. As they were preparing for their punishment, the sheikh announced, &quot;It&apos;s my first wife&apos;s birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.&quot; The South African was first. He thought for a while, then said, &quot;Please tie a pillow to my back.&quot; This was done, but the pillow lasted only 10 lashes before the whip went through. When the punishment was done, the South African had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain. The Australian was next up. After watching the South African&apos;s horror, he said smugly, &quot;Please fix\u00a0two pillows to my back.&quot; But even two pillows could take only 15 lashes before the whip went through and the Australian was soon led away whimpering loudly (as they do). The New Zealander was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the sheikh turned to him and said, &quot;You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest. For this, you may have two wishes!&quot; &quot;Thank you, your most royal and merciful highness,&quot; the Kiwi replied. &quot;In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20 lashes but 100 lashes.&quot; &quot;Not only are you an honourable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave,&quot; the sheikh said with an admiring look on his face. &quot;If\u00a0100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it.

Bumper-to-bumper traffic, much of it stationary, the acrid steam of a thousand exhausts hanging in the cold winter air. If you wanted to kill someone, this would be the moment to do it: when they are stuck in their cars \u2013 sitting targets. At 7.40am last Monday, in north Tehran&apos;s Aghdasieh district, a motorcycle threaded its way through the long lines of cars on Artesh Boulevard. It edged up to a silver Peugeot 405, hesitating alongside for moment, before moving off into the maze of vehicles. A few seconds later there was a bang from the side of the Peugeot, as a small bomb stuck on to the window detonated, killing one of the men inside. The driver and a woman passenger were wounded. At the same time, a few kilometres to the west, an identical attack was under way. A motorcycle came up beside another Peugeot and then moved on, but this time a man immediately jumped out of the car, ran around to let a woman out on the other side, and both of them managed to scramble a couple of metres from the car before the bomb went off. They were bloodied, but survived. The dead man was Majid Shahriari, a senior Iranian nuclear scientist. The head of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, Ali Akbar Salehi, who attended his funeral, said Shahriari had been &quot;in charge of one of the great projects&quot; at Iran&apos;s atomic energy agency \u2013 a project he did not describe any further. The wounded man, Fereydoun Abbasi, was a 52-year-old nuclear scientist working for Iran&apos;s defence ministry, one of &quot;Iran&apos;s few experts on fissile isotopes and the ministry&apos;s laser expert&quot;. He is also named in a UN security council sanctions resolution as working on &quot;banned nuclear activities&quot; with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the scientist suspected by inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency of running Iran&apos;s secret nuclear weapons programme. The wives of both scientists were wounded in the attacks. The attacks had clear echoes of the unsolved assassination in January this year of one of their colleagues, particle physicist Masoud Alimohammadi. He was killed in north Tehran on his way to work, at about the same time of the morning, by a bomb strapped to a motorcycle. After his death, to the surprise of many of his students, it was reported that he also had links with Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. If there were any doubts after Alimohammadi&apos;s killing back in January, there could be none after last week&apos;s double attack. Someone is trying to kill nuclear scientists linked to Iran&apos;s defence establishment \u2013 the people most likely to be involved in the covert side of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, the making of nuclear weapons. In the febrile atmosphere of Iranian underground politics, speculation quickly spread that the dark forces of the state were at work against would-be dissidents, leakers or defectors, but those rumours quickly evaporated. The Islamic Republic has many other ways of taking people it suspects out of circulation. It has little to gain by sacrificing the nation&apos;s must strategic asset \u2013 its nuclear know-how, the teachers of a new generation of atomic scientists. After last week, that new generation must be wondering whether to change career. The Tehran regime itself had little doubt over who was to blame. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad quickly pointed the finger at &quot;western governments and the Zionist regime&quot;. Ahmadinejad blames almost every national setback on the same culprits, but in this case there were no snorts of derision from the security analysts and intelligence experts in the west, but rather murmurs of assent. There is general agreement that the nature of the simultaneous attacks was too sophisticated to be entirely home-grown \u2013 the work of the handful of groups who harry the Islamic Republic around its ethnic edges, like the Sunni Jundullah group, the Kurdish rebels in the north-east, or the People&apos;s Mujahedin (which has vowed to give up violence to win removal from the US state department&apos;s list of terrorist organisations). The assassination had the hallmark of well-practised professionals. The explosives were shaped to focus the blast and fire a hail of projectiles into the car at an individual target, with minimal &quot;collateral damage&quot;. The targets were obviously carefully chosen and the attack would have required weeks of surveillance. So even if local assassins were involved, the questions of who trained and funded them and assigned the targets would remain. Time magazine last week claimed to have been given details of the attack from &quot;a western intelligence expert with knowledge of the operation&quot; and asserted that it &quot;carried the signature of Israel&apos;s Mossad&quot;. It is certainly true that, while the discovery of any involvement in the killings of civilian scientists would be career-endingly embarrassing for the CIA or MI6, the Mossad is known for such exploits. It is widely believed to have killed scientists working on Iraq&apos;s nuclear programme in the 1980s. The outgoing Mossad director, Meir Dagan, has stepped up the use of assassinations against Israel&apos;s enemies, and has won plaudits for doing so. The Israel Hayom news website remarked on the occasion of Dagan&apos;s retirement: &quot;[He] will be leaving an organisation that is far sharper and more operational than the organisation he received, and all of the accusations from Tehran yesterday are a good indication of that. Iran will be the focal point for the next Mossad director, too.&quot; If it does indeed turn out that the Mossad was involved, the bloodshed in the middle of Tehran represents a bloody episode in a secret war over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme that has been under way for years. It has come at a time when diplomacy is at a standstill. Officials from six major powers \u2013 the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany \u2013 are due to meet Iranian chief negotiator Saeed Jalili in Geneva tomorrow for the first time in more than a year. But expectations are low. Iran has shown no interest in complying with UN demands to cease the enrichment of uranium, despite four sets of sanctions. Tehran has also turned down a deal to swap some of its stock of low-enriched uranium for ready-made fuel rods it urgently needs for a medical research reactor. Military action has been contemplated for years, in Washington and Tel Aviv, but both have concluded that air strikes on nuclear sites would have an uncertain and far from fatal impact on Iran&apos;s programme, would unleash years of unpredictable, painful reprisals, and would probably spur Tehran on in the quest to develop nuclear weapons. The Pentagon has contingency plans, but there is no real likelihood of the US starting a third war in the region any time soon. Israel is another matter. Israeli officials say they are well aware of the downsides of military action, but they insist that none compares with the &quot;existential threat&quot; posed to their country by a nuclear-armed Iran. Without giving a green light, the US has supplied the tools Israel would need to do the job. One of the US cables made public by WikiLeaks describes a meeting of a US-Israeli joint political military group in November last year. It said: &quot;The GOI [Government of Israel] described 2010 as a critical year \u2013 if the Iranians continue to protect and harden their nuclear sites, it will be more difficult to target and damage them. Both sides then discussed the upcoming delivery of bunker-busting bombs to Israel, noting that the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the US is helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran.&quot; The bombs duly arrived a few months later. The WikiLeaks cables also underpin a prediction made by western military officials earlier this year, that if Israel flew above Saudi Arabia to reach Iranian targets Saudi radar operators would somehow &quot;fail to see them&quot;. Yet Israel has hesitated. It is not the first time a year it deemed &quot;crucial&quot; has come and gone. Iran has now accumulated 3,000kg of low-enriched uranium \u2013 enough for two weapons, if further enriched. And this year Iranian scientists have stepped up the level of enrichment they are working on to 20%, which in terms of the technical obstacles that need to be overcome, is well on the way to 90% weapons-grade purity. With each milestone passed, Iran has flaunted its achievements, yet Israel&apos;s sword has remained sheathed. It is clear that war is the last resort. Given diplomacy&apos;s ineffectiveness and the unknowable but terrible consequences of air strikes, it is easy to see why covert action is the least bad option; most of the successes and failures in this war will remain unsung, but some have made news. In September last year, Barack Obama announced the discovery of a secret enrichment plant burrowed into a mountain near the city of Qom. It had been under satellite surveillance for some time. Western officials say that it was information from defectors and agents on the ground that confirmed the nature of the facility. Iran subsequently allowed IAEA inspectors into the site, but withheld blueprints which would have given away more of its ultimate purpose. In June 2009, an Iranian nuclear scientist called Shahram Amiri disappeared while making the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Three months later, the Iranian government claimed he was being held by the US \u2013 a claim echoed by several western reports that Amiri had defected and was living somewhere in America under a new identity. However, in July this year the scientist turned up at the Iranian interests section of the Pakistani embassy, claiming he had been held against his will and wanted to go home. Amiri returned to a hero&apos;s welcome in Iran, while back in the US he has been portrayed as a defector who lost his nerve. Ahmadinejad admitted last week that Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment plant had been affected by the Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted the industrial management software that Iran uses to run its centrifuges. Like most computer viruses and worms, Stuxnet does not bear fingerprints, but a western military source recently told the Observer that it was an Israeli creation. Ahmadinejad claimed that the damage caused by Stuxnet had been overcome, but the enrichment programme clearly has major problems that cannot be easily fixed. The IAEA reported last week that enrichment ceased altogether in mid-November. The centrifuges at the Natanz plant continued to spin, but no uranium gas was fed into them, a very rare stoppage that suggested there was a fault in the system. The main centrifuge the Iranians are using, known as the P-1, is rudimentary and outdated and prone to crash, so that may be part of the problem. But the US, Israel and other western spy agencies have also spent years slipping faulty parts into black market consignments of equipment heading to Iran \u2013 each designed to wreak havoc inside the delicate machinery requirement for enrichment. Last week&apos;s events suggest that, as Iran continues to built up its stock of enriched uranium despite such difficulties, finesse is giving way to more brutal methods in this secret war. Its first victim may have been Ardeshir Hassanpour, another top nuclear scientist, who co-founded Iran&apos;s nuclear technology centre in Isfahan. Officially, Hassanpour died from radiation poisoning in 2007. But some reports, yet to be confirmed, claimed he was killed by the Mossad. If that is true, the toll so far is three scientists dead, one wounded. The front line in the war of Iran&apos;s nuclear project is not where most expected it to be drawn \u2013 at the enrichment plant in Natanz, or the mountain cavern at Qom, or the Revolutionary Guard bases where Iran tests its missiles. Instead it runs through university faculties and the leafy suburbs of north Tehran where Iran&apos;s academic elite make their homes. It is a covert war, with very high stakes, in which civilians are the primary targets, and Majid Shahriari is unlikely to be the last victim.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-05T00:07:46Z", "title": "Covert war against Iran's nuclear aims takes chilling turn", "sentences": ["Military action has been contemplated for years, in Washington and Tel Aviv, but both have concluded that air strikes on nuclear sites would have an uncertain and far from fatal impact on Iran&apos;s programme, would unleash years of unpredictable, painful reprisals, and would probably spur Tehran on in the quest to develop nuclear weapons."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/05/iran-nuclear-experts-killings"}, {"tags": ["The Mossad", "Iran", "Nuclear weapons"], "article": "Saeed Kamali Dehghan, The Guardian&apos;s Iran correspondent in exile, has pointed me towards this Wikileaks cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv.

State department cables released by WikiLeaks show that Sudan was warned by the US in January 2009 not to allow the delivery of unspecified Iranian arms that were expected to be passed to Hamas in the Gaza Strip around the time of Israel&apos;s Cast Lead offensive, in which 1,400 Palestinians were killed. US diplomats were instructed to express &quot;exceptional concern&quot; to the Khartoum authorities. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Chad were informed of the alleged Iranian plans and warned that any weapons deliveries would be in breach of UN resolutions banning Iranian arms exports. Sudan&apos;s foreign minister told a US official his government&apos;s formal response would be that it was not permitting the import of weapons from Iran \u2013 only to be told that &quot;a simple regurgitation of Sudan&apos;s previous denial would be unfortunate&quot;. Months later the media reported that in mid-January Israeli planes mounted a long-range bombing attack on an arms convoy in Sudan&apos;s Red Sea province. The Sharq al-Awsat newspaper quoted a US official as saying Sudan had been warned in advance about the shipment. State department documents record that Khartoum then privately accused the US of carrying out two air attacks in eastern Sudan: one in January 2009, with 43 dead and 17 vehicles destroyed, and another on 20 February, with 45 dead and 14 vehicles destroyed. &quot;We assume that the planes that attacked us are your planes,&quot; a senior Sudanese official said. The US embassy in Khartoum then sought clarification from Washington. &quot;Should this potentially explosive story somehow leak to the sensationalistic Sudanese press,&quot; the cable said, &quot;it could very well turn our security situation here from bad to worse.&quot; Explaining the political background to the confrontation, the head of Sudan&apos;s intelligence and security service, Salah Ghosh, told US diplomats of his government&apos;s frustration over Washington&apos;s support for Israel during the Gaza war. US actions would &quot;calamitously increase support for violent extremism and [push] Hamas into an alliance with Iran&quot;, he warned. In March 2009, Jordan and Egypt were informed by the US of new Iranian plans to ship a cargo of &quot;lethal military equipment&quot; to Syria with onward transfer to Sudan and then to Hamas. Host nations were requested to require that the flights land for inspection or deny them overflight rights. It is not known whether any deliveries went ahead. In April Egypt&apos;s interior minister, General Habib al-Adly, was described in US cables as being behind the dismantling of a Hezbollah cell in Sinai as well as &quot;steps to disrupt the flow of Iranian-supplied arms from Sudan through Egypt to Gaza&quot;. At the end of that month Egypt&apos;s intelligence chief, General Omar Soleiman, told US officials Egypt was &quot;succeeding&quot; in preventing Iran from funnelling financial support to Hamas. &quot;Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they interfere in Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran, adding that EGIS [Egyptian intelligence service] had already begun recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria,&quot; Soleiman said. In June Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s prime minister, told US officials there was &quot;a steady flow of Iranian weapons to Gaza through Sudan or Syria and then by sea&quot;, though &quot;Egypt&apos;s performance in stopping the tunnels [into Gaza] improved after Cairo understood that the Iranian arms pipeline is a direct threat to Egypt as well&quot;. Iran, a Mossad representative told a US delegation in late 2009, &quot;is very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to its proxies&quot;. It was widely reported in February 2010 that Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas official who was assassinated in Dubai by suspected Mossad agents, had been the key weapons procurement link between the Palestinian organisation and Iran. Only rarely do the US cables show evidence of direct Israeli requests to the US to block arms deliveries, probably because they would be highly classified. But in one bilateral meeting in Tel Aviv in 2009 a senior state department official noted &quot;most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on Israeli intelligence. Additional information/intelligence from the government of Israel would ensure greater co-operation&quot;. In February 2010 Israeli military intelligence informed the US that Syria &quot;intended to imminently transfer&quot; Scud-D ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, warning of a &quot;new level of concern&quot; on the northern border if the transfer went ahead. The Israelis requested that any demarche be delivered before the arrival in Washington of their defence minister, Ehud Barak, to avoid the impression &quot;that the US and Israel collaborated to uncover and thwart the transfer&quot;. Three days later the US warned Syria that it would be a &quot;strategic miscalculation&quot; to provide the Lebanese group with these weapons. President Assad was informed of US concerns by the undersecretary of state, William Burns. But the Syrian leader &quot;bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to Hezbollah \u2026 despite disturbing and weighty evidence to the contrary&quot;. Syria&apos;s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Miqdad, countered that the message showed that &quot;the US has not come to a mature position [that would enable it] to differentiate between its own interests and Israel&apos;s&quot;. But US allies in the west and the Arab world were told bluntly: &quot;These are US concerns. We are not carrying somebody else&apos;s &apos;water&apos; on this issue&quot; \u2013 a clear reference to Israel. Evidence of earlier US interest in blocking arms deliveries to Hezbollah and Hamas can be seen in secret cables dating from June 2006. Jordan&apos;s general intelligence directorate chief, General Muhammad Dahabi, told the assistant secretary of state, David Welch, that he had recently met the head of Iran&apos;s foreign intelligence service, who complained that Jordan had publicised Hamas attempts to smuggle weapons via Jordan to the West Bank. Dahabi later told the Americans that Jordan had refused a Syrian request for an overflight involving a suspected weapons shipment to Hezbollah, triggering an angry complaint from Damascus. In July 2007 Dahabi told a US delegation: &quot;Syria is the very lung through which al-Qaida breathes&quot;. Syrian spy chief tells allThe US and Syria are at odds over Hamas, Hezbollah and, until recently, foreign jihadis in Iraq. So it was a surprise for the state department&apos;s top counter-terrorism official when the head of one of Syria&apos;s secret services turned up at a meeting in Damascus this year \u2013 and proceeded to describe his methods. General Ali Mamlouk, director of the general intelligence department, told Daniel Benjamin that Syria had been more successful than the US and other countries in fighting terrorism because &quot;we are practical and not theoretical&quot;, according to a leaked embassy cable. The trick was to infiltrate terrorist groups. &quot;In principle, we don&apos;t attack or kill them immediately. Instead, we embed ourselves in them and only at the opportune moment do we move.&quot; As a result scores of terrorists had been detained and hundreds prevented from entering Iraq, though some were still slipping through. &quot;By all means we will continue to do all this, but if we start co-operation with you it will lead to better results and we can better protect our interests,&quot; Mamlouk concluded.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-06T21:30:00Z", "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Sudan warned to block Iranian arms bound for Gaza", "sentences": ["But in one bilateral meeting in Tel Aviv in 2009 a senior state department official noted &quot;most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on Israeli intelligence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/06/wikileaks-sudan-iranian-arms-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US foreign policy", "Arms trade", "Lebanon", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "Hezbollah"], "article": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 14:45S E C R E T TEL AVIV 000414 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2025 TAGS PREL, PTER, MASS, SY, LE, IS SUBJECT: ISRAELI OFFICIALS REQUEST USG DEMARCHE SYRIA ON POSSIBLE MISSILE TRANSFER TO HIZBALLAHREF: IIR 6-849-9075-10Classified By: Luis G.

Feltman for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph four. Summary ------- 2. (S) We previously demarched Britain, France, and Turkey on our increasing concerns over Syria&apos;s continued provision of advanced weapons to Hizballah (Ref A). In London, Paris and Ankara the demarches were taken seriously and all governments pledged to raise their concern with Syrian officials. French diplomats noted that they routinely deliver the same message to the Syrians, but that Damascus denies involvement. This issue now needs to be reinforced with these governments and brought to the attention of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar. Under Secretary Burns visited Damascus on February 17 and stressed U.S. concerns about weapons transfers to Hizballah directly with Syrian President Bashar Asad, who bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to Hizballah. In light of disturbing and weighty evidence to the contrary -- that Syria currently provides Hizballah with advanced ballistic missiles and other weaponry -- we want France, Britain, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar to make a renewed push to echo our concerns with Syria, given that Syria continues to ignore warnings that its transfers of advanced surface-to-surface and surface-to-air weapons to Hizballah could jeopardize prospects for an agreement with Israel or spark a conflict significantly more destructive than the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war. Syria&apos;s actions clearly jeopardize regional stability and could risk drawing Damascus into any future war between Israel and Hizballah. 3. (S) The Syrian leadership views military support to Hizballah as integral to Syria&apos;s security and as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with Israel over the return of the Golan Heights, as well as a possible stick to bring the Israelis back to the table. While our commitment to principled engagement with Syria -- as demonstrated by Under Secretary Burns&apos; recent visit -- remains strong, we must enlist additional French, British, Turkish, Saudi, Jordanian, and Qatari support to help dissuade Syria from expanding its ties to Hizballah any further, especially via the transfer of additional sophisticated weaponry. Objectives ---------- 4. (S/REL FRANCE, BRITAIN, TURKEY, SAUDI ARABIA, JORDAN, AND QATAR) Drawing on paragraphs 2 and 3 for context, we request that Embassies in Paris, London, Ankara, Riyadh, Amman, and Doha pursue the following objectives with senior French, British, Turkish, Saudi, Jordanian, and Qatari officials at the highest appropriate levels. -- Highlight that Under Secretary Burns visited Damascus on February 17 as part of our ongoing engagement with Syria. Reiterate our commitment to sustained, principled engagement with Syria. We plan to continue our dialogue with Syria and look forward to the arrival of our new ambassador in Damascus once the confirmation process is complete. -- Stress that in addition to discussing bilateral issues of mutual interest, Under Secretary Burns conveyed to President Asad a number of our priority concerns with Syria, specifically cross-border weapons smuggling into Lebanon destined for Hizballah. -- Note that in response, Asad claimed that Syria could not be Israel&apos;s policeman and that he knew of no new weapons systems being smuggled from Syria to Hizballah. -- Underscore that, contrary to President Asad&apos;s statements, we are aware of current Syrian efforts to supply ballistic missiles to Hizballah. -- We also note President Asad&apos;s recent comments -- during a February 25 joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart -- that support for Hizballah was a &quot;moral and legal duty.&quot; -- Express deep concern that Syria&apos;s expanding military ties to Hizballah, including the supply of ballistic missiles to Hizballah, jeopardize regional prospects for peace and stability. Specifically, Syrian transfers of increasingly sophisticated weaponry risk renewed conflict between Israel and Hizballah that may expand, unlike in 2006, into Syria. -- Convey that arms shipments to Hizballah -- especially ballistic missiles -- increasingly undermine Israel&apos;s confidence in Syria&apos;s willingness and ability to deliver peace and diminish the value of an eventual Syrian-Israeli accord, as Hizballah will not return the weapons it has already received. -- Underscore that the next report on Security Council resolution 1701 will be discussed on March 12. Full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701, including the arms embargo and weapons-free zone, remains a priority for the United States. In light of the upcoming report, it is especially important to stress that Syria&apos;s actions constitute serious violations of Security Council resolution 1701 -- which will be taken seriously by the international community -- and belie its claims to respect Lebanon&apos;s sovereignty. -- Express our appreciation for your host government&apos;s support on the critical issue of Syrian weapons transfers to Hizballah and note that we hope to continue our cooperation to prevent serious miscalculations by the Syrian government. -- Share the following S/REL FRANCE, BRITAIN, TURKEY, SAUDI ARABIA, JORDAN, QATAR text verbatim: (Begin releasable text.) We would like to convey to you that we have information indicating that Syria is providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to Hizballah, including from its own military stocks. For example, we assess that Syria has provided or will provided guided short range ballistic missiles to Hizballah that could target two-thirds of Israel, including Tel Aviv, from launch sites north of the Litani. Our information also indicates that Syria has made advanced surface to air missile systems available to Hizballah and has probably provided training on these systems to Hizballah personnel. (End releasable text.) -- Urge France, Britain, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar to raise these concerns once again in their dialogue with senior Syrian officials. We do not want to undermine our collective outreach to Syria. However, we are increasingly concerned that the Syrian government is making a strategic miscalculation by incorrectly assuming that increasing Hizballah&apos;s military capability concomitantly bolsters Syria&apos;s security and strength at the negotiating table with Israel, when the opposite is more likely to be true. -- Syria&apos;s desire for a deterrent against Israeli military action -- presumably a motivation for the transfer of ballistic missiles to Hizballah -- is not producing a stable deterrent because there are no mechanisms to prevent unanticipated escalation. Not having control over Hizballah&apos;s missiles increases the risk of this danger. -- Emphasize that Syria&apos;s actions risk derailing our common efforts to bring peace to the region. -- Note that we are raising our concerns with Syrian officials in Damascus and with the Syrian Ambassador here in Washington. -- Also note our continuing strong commitment and support to the full implementation of resolutions 1747 and 1701, encouraging France, Britain, and Turkey to stress their continuing support for the full implementation of resolution 1701 -- in its entirety (including the arms embargo and weapons free zone) -- with senior Syrian officials. -- These are U.S. concerns. We are not carrying somebody else&apos;s &quot;water&quot; on this issue. -- (For Turkey) Express that we greatly appreciate Turkey&apos;s continued efforts to combat weapons smuggling. As conveyed by Under Secretary Burns when he was in Ankara on February 18, we urge Turkey to use its close ties with Damascus to underscore the repercussions that Syria&apos;s continued provision of weapons to Hizballah has for regional stability and the broader goal of Middle East peace. We hope that Turkey will leverage its influence with Syria on this crucial issue. Reporting Deadline ------------------ 5.

US reports from February 2008, revealed by WikiLeaks, described how the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was shocked when Imad Mughniyeh was murdered by a sophisticated bomb planted in his car. Mughniyeh, a founder member of the militant Lebanese Shia movement, was wanted by the US, Israel, France and other governments. Hezbollah is backed by Iran and Syria. &quot;Syrian military intelligence and general intelligence directorate officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security that resulted in Mughniyeh&apos;s death,&quot; the US embassy reported. Saudi Arabia&apos;s ambassador to Lebanon, the well-connected Abdel Aziz Khoja, told US diplomats in Beirut that Hezbollah believed the Syrians were responsible for the Damascus killing. No Syrian official was present at Mughniyeh&apos;s funeral in Beirut&apos;s southern suburbs the following day. Iran was represented by its foreign minister, who, the Saudi envoy said, had come to calm down Hezbollah and keep it from taking action against Syria. Another rumour, Khoja said, was that Syria and Israel had made a deal to allow Mughniyeh to be killed, an Israeli objective. No one has ever claimed responsibility for the assassination, though Israel has been widely blamed for it. US diplomats reported that the killing led to tensions between Syria and Iran, perhaps because Tehran shared Khoja&apos;s suspicion of Syrian complicity in the affair. It took more than a year for Syrian-Iranian relations to improve, with a low-profile visit to Damascus in late 2009 by the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard&apos;s (IRGC) elite al-Quds force, Qassem Suleimani, described by a Lebanese source as being at &quot;the business end&quot; of Hezbollah&apos;s military activities. US officials speculated that Soleimani&apos;s long absence was &quot;perhaps a reflection of lingering tensions between Iran and Syria that erupted after the assassination of Mughniyeh&quot;. Both the US and Israel say explicitly that they want to weaken the links between Iran and its main Arab ally, Syria. Mughniyeh, linked to the kidnappings of western hostages in the 1980s, was a controversial and shadowy figure whose influence reaches beyond the grave. In 2006 the Lebanese defence minister, Elias Murr, told US diplomats that Mughniyeh was &quot;very active in Beirut&quot;, hinting that he was involved in a spate of murders of Lebanese politicians who were hostile to Syria. According to Murr, Mughniyeh was working with the IRGC on the one hand and the Syrian intelligence supremo (and President Assad&apos;s brother-in-law) Asef Shawkat on the other. In recent weeks tensions have again mounted in Lebanon over expectations that the special UN tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of the former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri will indict Hezbollah officials. The group has warned all Lebanese people to boycott the tribunal. Syria was widely blamed for the killing but has always denied involvement. In January this year, state department cables show, Israeli officials expressed concern to the UN co-ordinator for Lebanon that Hezbollah would &quot;act on its standing threat to retaliate for the death of Imad Mughniyeh&quot;. Israel had previously warned that &quot;the next round of fighting with Hezbollah would likely involve rockets falling on Tel Aviv, and if this happens Israel will respond harshly throughout Lebanon.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T21:30:11Z", "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Syria stunned by Hezbollah assassination", "sentences": ["Israel had previously warned that &quot;the next round of fighting with Hezbollah would likely involve rockets falling on Tel Aviv, and if this happens Israel will respond harshly throughout Lebanon.&quot;"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-syria-hezbollah-assassination"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Lebanon", "Syria", "Iran", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Thursday, 18 June 2009, 08:49S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 TEL AVIV 001324 SIPDIS DEPT FOR S/SEMEP EO 12958 DECL: 06/18/2019 TAGS PREL, LE, SY, UN, IS SUBJECT: GOI DISCUSSES LEBANON AND SYRIA WITH HOF Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno, reason 1.4 (b) a nd (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY. On June 10, Fred Hof, Special Advisor for Regional Affairs in the office of Special Envoy Mitchell, held a series of meetings with GOI officials from the MFA and MOD to discuss the situation in Lebanon and Syria and the possibilities for progress towards opening negotiations with each. The Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism over the election results in Lebanon, but did not believe they would lead to major changes in the power balance in Lebanon, or serious reduction of Hizballah influence. However, both Amos Gilad, Pol-Mil Director in the MOD and Nimrod Barkan, Director of the MFA Political Research Division (INR equivalent), told Hof that the Lebanese election results took Syria by surprise, and were a blow for Syrian President Asad. The officials were split over the prospects for Israeli peace with Syria. Alon Ushpiz, Chief of Staff for the MFA Director General, believes Syria is only interested in a process that gives it international legitimacy. However, in a separate meeting, Gilad called Syrian/Iran ties a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot; which could possibly be broken with a peace agreement with Israel and incentives from the United States. On Ghajar and Sheba&apos;a, there was consensus within the GOI that Ghajar can be resolved, but doing so will not have much utility, while Israeli will only agree to discuss Sheba&apos;a within the context of Syria. End Summary. ---------------------------- Lebanon Elections Hurt Syria ---------------------------- 2. (C) The Israeli officials said that it is too soon to tell what the results of the elections in Lebanon will really mean. Nimrod Barkan told Hof that he does not see the elections as damaging for Hizballah, as their popularity among the Shia remained solid. He added that if Hizballah could maintain its blocking third within the GOL as established in the Doha Agreement, the Lebanese government would remain paralyzed. In another meeting, Amos Gilad assessed that the elections results were largely due to huge amounts of Saudi Arabian money and the Maronite Patriarch throwing his support to March 14, and not because of a fundamental shift in Lebanese society. 3. (C) On the other hand, both Gilad and Barkan agreed that the elections were a blow to Syria, which was completely caught off-guard by the results. The Syrian presidential advisors on Lebanon, they said, are now in trouble. Barkan explained that the Syrians were so convinced the pro-Syrian March 8 would win the elections that they thought they could minimize their interference and still win. They wanted to appease France and the United States, and not irritate Saudi Arabia, and thought they could do so at no cost. In this way, Barkan said, French and American actions and rhetoric in support of March 14 were productive. --------------------------------------------- ------- Hizballah Still Planning to Avenge Mughniyah&apos;s Death --------------------------------------------- ------- 4. (S) Barkan emphasized that Hizballah still plans on avenging the death of Hizballah operations chief Imad Mughniyah, and that Israel has already thwarted two terror attacks in third countries. Barkan said Israel has very sensitive intelligence that Hizballah has completed operational planning for a third attack outside Israel, but so far Nasrallah has not decided whether to give the order to carry it out, despite Iranian pressure to launch the attack. Barkan said he had personally drafted the MFA&apos;s post-Lebanon election statement, which included a warning the GOL that Israel will hold them responsible for any attacks &quot;emanating from Lebanon&quot; and not just attacks from Lebanon. Gilad also told Hof that Hizballah had shown restraint in the face of Iranian pressure due to the elections, especially during the Gaza operation. Barkan and Gilad both emphasized that they did not know if Hizballah&apos;s calculus would change post-election. Gilad warned Hof that the next round of fighting with Hizballah would likely involve rockets falling on Tel Aviv, and if this happens Israel will respond harshly throughout Lebanon. ------------------------------------ Can Syria Separate Itself from Iran? ------------------------------------ 5. (C) Hof also held a meeting with senior MFA staff, including Deputy Director General for Coordination (Director General Chief of Staff) Alon Ushpiz, Minister Lieberman&apos;s Chief of Staff Naor Gilon, and Deputy Minister Ayalon&apos;s Chief TEL AVIV 00001324 002 OF 003 of Staff David Siegel. Ushpiz asked Hof if the United States really sought peace with Syria in the near term, or if it saw Israeli engagement with Syria as a way to put pressure on the Palestinian track, create space in the Arab world, and gain influence with Syria. Hof replied that all of those goals could be pursued simultaneously, including peace. During the proximity talks in Turkey conducted under the Olmert government, Ushpiz said that President Bush gave PM Olmert the approval to hold talks through Turkey, but said the United States would not get involved, so Israel went as far as it could. Israel was also unsure about proceeding because, they said, the GOI remained skeptical regarding Syria&apos;s intentions to withdraw itself from its alliance with Iran in exchange for peace. 6. (C) Amos Gilad, on the other hand, told Hof that the GOI defense establishment assesses that Syria may be serious about removing itself from Iran and withdrawing support for Hizballah in exchange for reconciliation with the West, especially the U.S., and the return of the Golan Heights. Gilad asserted that peace with Syria is critical to achieving Israel-Palestinian peace due to Syria&apos;s ability to support spoilers. Therefore, he asserted, it was worth it for Israel to make the attempt. In the talks through Turkish mediation, however, Gilad said that Israel had been too forthcoming about its security requirements, and too enthusiastic, and Syria was not ready. He also noted that Israeli security requirements with Syria had changed radically since the last talks in 2000, as Israel no longer fears a Syrian surprise armor attack across the Golan but rather is concerned about Syrian missile attacks on Israeli cities, so those issues would need to be renegotiated. 7. (S) Negotiations with Syria may succeed, Gilad said, because Iran was a marriage of convenience for Syria. He believes Syria would much rather be close to their fellow Arabs and the rest of the international community, if given the chance. Gilad stressed that both the Iranians and the Arab Sunnis despise the ruling Alawite minority in Syria - he recalled that Sadat used to call the Alawites &quot;pagans&quot; - and said the Iranians would like to get rid of the Asad regime at the appropriate time. Gilad noted that Syria did not inform Iran of its nuclear reactor, which was built entirely with North Korean assistance, and did not notify Iran in advance of its proximity talks with Israel. In addition, he said, the Golan Heights have remained Israel&apos;s quietest front, evidence that Syria can uphold its commitments as long its commitments are clear. 8. (C) While Syria may want peace, Gilad cautioned that it may be impossible for Syria to extricate itself from Iran and Hizballah, even if it tried. Hizballah is now an integral part of Syria&apos;s defense concept, and is a more effective fighting force than the Syrian army. But in the end, Gilad stated, Israel only has two choices with Syria: war or peace. --------------------------------------------- ----- Hof: Small Steps Needed Towards Talks with Lebanon --------------------------------------------- ----- 9. (C) Turning to the prospects for moving toward peace with Lebanon, Barkan and Gilad separately told Hof that the GOI had examined the question of renewing the 1949 armistice commission, at the USG&apos;s suggestion, and there were many questions, including some basic legal questions posed by MFA lawyers. Hof replied that much of the armistice agreement is obsolete, but the armistice allows for mutually agreed modifications, and recognition of its basic legitimacy among the Lebanese, and the fact that it is mentioned in the Taif Agreement, could create cover for talks. 10. (C) Hof suggested an incremental strategy for Lebanon, expanding existing, low-level mil-mil trilateral contacts with UNIFIL gradually until they eventually can encompass some political progress. Small steps were needed because the Lebanese people&apos;s attitude toward Israel had hardened over the past 30 years, Hof explained, and we need to get them back to seeing peace with Israel as a realistic prospect. 11. (C) Gilad, Barkan, and the senior MFA officials separately told Hof that Israel was ready to move forward with resolving the issue of the northern end of the village of Ghajar, but doubted that resolving the issue would lead to real progress and risked boosting Hizballah. Hof replied that Ghajar can be an important step as long as any Israeli public message is carefully calibrated to emphasize that Israel is fulfilling its 1701 obligations, and that other parties should do the same, and not as a benefit to the Lebanese moderates. It is a small step, Hof said, but the kind of small step needed in this process. TEL AVIV 00001324 003 OF 003 12. (C) On Sheba&apos;a Farms, all the GOI officials separately repeated the long-standing position that Sheba&apos;a must be resolved in the context of Syria and not Lebanon. Sheba&apos;a, they said, was simply a pretext for Hizballah&apos;s claim to represent &quot;resistance to occupation,&quot; and if it were resolved Hizballah would simply find another pretext. Hof agreed that it was a pretext, but thought it would be useful to make Hizballah publicly shift their pretext. Issues like the seven Lebanese villages in northern Israel, Hof explained, are not taken seriously in Lebanese society, but the Lebanese claim to Sheba&apos;a Farms is. Forcing Hizballah to shift its excuse for retaining an armed force could help expose them to Lebanese society as Iranian surrogates willing to fight to the last Lebanese. 13. (U) Fred Hof has cleared this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T21:30:13Z", "title": "US embassy cables: Israel warns of reprisals against Lebanon in case of  rocket attacks", "sentences": ["Gilad warned Hof that the next round of fighting with Hizballah would likely involve rockets falling on Tel Aviv, and if this happens Israel will respond harshly throughout Lebanon.", "********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212752"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "More than 50 of Israel&apos;s leading rabbis have issued a religious decree forbidding Jews from renting or selling homes or land to non-Jews \u2013 namely, Arabs, migrant workers and African refugees. The letter was signed by rabbis across the country (many of whom are employed by the state as municipal religious leaders) and urged Jews to first warn and then &quot;ostracise&quot; fellow Jews who disobey the edict. It&apos;s just the latest wave in a rising tide of religious fascism. In Safed, less than two months ago, more than a dozen rabbis urged Jewish landlords to refrain from renting to Arab college students. This summer, a group of Tel Aviv rabbis signed a letter instructing Jews not to rent to &quot;infiltrators&quot; \u2013 the state&apos;s word for African refugees, most of whom have escaped genocide in Sudan or a brutal dictatorship in Eritrea. Ten estate agents answered the call. And, in November, the municipality of Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, launched a campaign to rid the area of migrant workers and African refugees. By the end of the month, officials \u2013 government employees \u2013 were going door to door telling foreigners they had to leave. The latest move, first publicised on Tuesday on Ynet&apos;s Hebrew site, is the largest step that Israel&apos;s religious community has taken against non-Jews. And it is, perhaps, the most alarming. Rabbis from all over the country signed the proclamation. And they didn&apos;t try to hide their intentions. &quot;We don&apos;t need to help Arabs set down roots in Israel,&quot; one remarked to Haaretz. &quot;Racism originated in the Torah,&quot; another said. For argument&apos;s sake, let&apos;s set aside the fact that the Palestinians had roots here long before the state of Israel existed. Let&apos;s pretend that they are &quot;strangers&quot; in this land, as these rabbis would surely claim. And let&apos;s turn to the same Torah that this group of rabbis is using as an excuse for racism and incitement. In Exodus, we are commanded not to expel others but to remember our exile in Egypt and to care for the strangers among us. And, again for argument&apos;s sake, I&apos;m going to set aside my many objections to Zionism and go to another root \u2013 Herzl, the founding father of the movement. What did he say about non-Jews? In his book Der Judenstaat, The Jewish State, Herzl wrote that &quot;we should accord \u2026 honourable protection and equality&quot; to &quot;men of other creeds and different nationalities&quot; because &quot;we have learnt toleration in Europe&quot;. Tuesday&apos;s proclamation \u2013 an act of state-sanctioned racism \u2013 shows that certain Jewish people have forgotten their history. The decree was an open declaration of war. It&apos;s a strike against the soul of Judaism. And if the religious fascists win, what will we be left with? A country that is Jewish in numbers but not in spirit. It could be argued that those who signed the proclamation \u2013 a group of men who are distorting Judaism to the point that I refuse to acknowledge them as rabbis \u2013 are extremists, that they don&apos;t represent the majority. Even if that is true, it doesn&apos;t change the fact that many are government employees. And, so far, the state has done nothing to put them in check. Israel is handing the reins over to religious fascists \u2013 men who say Jews shouldn&apos;t rent to Arabs, migrant workers, or African refugees; settlers who build illegally and imperil any hope for peace and Palestinian sovereignty. It&apos;s an ominous sign for the future. What&apos;s next? Will they find a way to claim that those of us who speak out, people like me, are no longer Jews? Will we then be subject to religious decrees that ban employers from hiring us and demand that landlords evict us?\u00a0 \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2010-12-08T13:02:58Z", "title": "Israeli rabbis' racist decree strikes at the soul of Judaism | Mya Guarnieri", "sentences": ["This summer, a group of Tel Aviv rabbis signed a letter instructing Jews not to rent to &quot;infiltrators&quot; \u2013 the state&apos;s word for African refugees, most of whom have escaped genocide in Sudan or a brutal dictatorship in Eritrea.", "And, in November, the municipality of Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, launched a campaign to rid the area of migrant workers and African refugees."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/08/israeli-rabbis-houses-arabs-judaism"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Pope Benedict XVI", "Egypt", "Eritrea", "Refugees", "Human rights", "Torture", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Christianity", "Africa", "The papacy"], "article": "On Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI called for prayer for &quot;the victims of traffickers and criminals, such as the drama of the hostages, Eritreans and of other nationalities, in the Sinai desert&quot;. By doing so, he lifted the lid on years of international indifference to the plight of thousands of people fleeing a variety of human rights crises in the Horn of Africa, who fall victim to highly organised and brutal gangs of Bedouin people-traffickers in Sudan, Libya and Egypt, but have been dismissed as economic migrants who, in the eyes of some, almost deserved their fate. The pope was referring to more than 250 people, some of whom have been held in purpose-built containers for more than a month by Bedouin people-traffickers in an area close to the Israeli border. Their captors, who are demanding payment of up to $8,000 a person for their release, are subjecting them to the most appalling abuse. They are bound by chains around their ankles, deprived of adequate food, given salty drinking water and tortured using extreme methods including branding, electric shocks and &quot;whipping rituals&quot;, in order to force friends and families abroad, who are contacted by satellite telephone as the torture is occurring, to make these payments. In addition, women are held separately and subjected to sustained, systematic rape by numerous assailants. Among this group are at least 80 Eritreans fleeing severe religious and political repression, who would be regarded as genuine refugees under UNHCR eligibility guidelines. There were more. However, three men were shot dead after their families confirmed they could not meet the payments. Following this incident, four others who do not have friends or family abroad were informed their kidneys would be harvested in lieu of payment. Like thousands of their fellow citizens, some of these Eritreans initially crossed the Sahara on foot, entering Sudan illegally, since leaving Eritrea legally requires an exit permit. However, others put their lives into the hands of traffickers from the Rashaida nomadic tribe, which straddles the border of these two countries. It is at that point that extortion begins and some female refugees start to suffer abuse. &quot;Women are raped before being taken across the border. You either agree or you don&apos;t cross,&quot; said one young woman, who spoke to me in the third person to distance herself from the pain of her experience. With her young son in tow, she had taken what she thought would be a safer route into Ethiopia, circumventing the heavily mined and extensively patrolled border between the two countries. &quot;Then before the Ethiopian border, two of the women were taken away. We don&apos;t know what happened to them.&quot; The close ties between the Sudanese and Eritrean governments, characterised by periodic roundups and returns of refugees, mean they fall easy prey to agents of Bedouin traffickers who promise access to Europe \u2013 Italy via Libya \u2013 or to Israel via Egypt, countries symbolising &quot;safety&quot;. However, the route to Europe has become increasingly difficult and in Libya refugees face imprisonment, possible forced return and severe societal abuse on racial grounds. Consequently, with help from friends and family, they pay $2,000 for a route into Israel that will by-pass Egyptian border guards, who so far this year have shot dead around 30 Africans as they attempted the crossing into Israel. However, instead of safe passage to Israel, the refugees find themselves in this desert detention centre, where they are abused in the most dehumanising manner in order to extort ever-increasing payments. Some are released and transferred across the border after payment has been made to the traffickers&apos; representatives in Eritrea, Sudan or Tel Aviv. Unfortunately, these severely traumatised people find no real relief in Israel, where Eritreans make up 60% of the 31,000 new African arrivals, and where a four-pronged plan to stem such arrivals has been presented to the Knesset that includes opening discussions with the repressive Eritrean regime for their return. Others meet a different fate. In June, Eritrean refugees were among 10 Africans reportedly murdered by traffickers after being held for more than two months. The pope&apos;s intervention has prompted international action and a reluctant Egyptian government is finally being forced to address the suffering of these hostages. Egypt had previously denied knowing the whereabouts of the detention camps \u2013 rather disingenuously, considering they are situated near one of the most sensitive international borders. With the help of some of the hostages, the Italian NGOs Everyone Group and Agenzia Habeshia have identified this area, informed appropriate authorities and have now filed criminal charges in Cairo against named traffickers. However, only sustained, high-level pressure on the government of Egypt will ensure a definitive end to the hostages&apos; ordeal, and the arrest and prosecution of members of these trafficking syndicates.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-09T10:00:01Z", "title": "The pope lifts the lid on Sinai's tortured Eritrean refugees | Khataza Gondwe", "sentences": ["Some are released and transferred across the border after payment has been made to the traffickers&apos; representatives in Eritrea, Sudan or Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/09/pope-sinai-torture-african-refugees"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Culture", "World music", "Pop and rock"], "article": "The day Ofra Haza died was actually the second time Israel had been plunged into a state of mourning for her. Thirteen years earlier, in February 1987, a Cessna aircraft carrying the most celebrated Israeli pop star of her generation had hit the side of a mountain on the border of Israel and Jordan. In the hours it took rescuers to find Haza and her entourage, Israeli newspapers assumed the worst. &quot;We lay there in the desert,&quot; remembers Haza&apos;s manager Bezalel Aloni, who was also on the plane. &quot;Ofra said that whatever happened next would be God&apos;s will. The day after that was like a national holiday. There was such jubilation.&quot; For many Israelis, it was hard to detect &quot;God&apos;s will&quot; in the manner of Haza&apos;s eventual passing. Ten years ago, the news that she had died, aged 42, as a result of Aids-related illness, belied everything Israel thought it knew about her. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, she was almost a wholesome mirror image of the kind of star Madonna was in the west. &quot;She kept a clean image,&quot; remembers Isthar Ashdoth, a producer and musician who worked with her. &quot;You never saw a picture of her with a man or any dirty gossip. For her, it was all about the voice.&quot; She had been entertaining audiences ever since she wandered into Aloni&apos;s orbit, aged just 11. Both Haza and Aloni came from the poor Hatikva district of Tel Aviv. She was the youngest of eight children, born to a generation of Yemeni Jews whose ancient way of life changed when their entire population was airlifted to the newly founded Israel. &quot;She became part of my family along with my wife and two sons,&quot; says Aloni. &quot;I wrote plays \u2026 I wanted to be a member of the Israeli parliament. I was not a songwriter, but I started writing songs for her, and \u2013 like a miracle! \u2013 they became hits.&quot; By 1983, when Haza represented Israel in the Eurovision song contest in Munich, she had enjoyed a string of Aloni-penned hits in her own country, but there was little to suggest she wanted to do anything other than match the success of the western pop stars who were ubiquitous on Israeli radio. However, Haza&apos;s next album was conceived as a thank you to her family \u2013 an album of devotional poems and secular street songs passed down from her Yemeni forebears. When Haza sang them, she sounded like a woman who was mainlining the hardships of centuries. Whatever status Yemenite Songs has gone on to accrue, the original reception meted out to it was bewilderment. Wally Brill, who would later work as a producer for Haza, attempts to put the album into context: &quot;There has always been a sort of chav culture in Israel. The notion of Ofra\u00a0becoming this poster girl of world music was surreal. It&apos;s on a par with Cheryl\u00a0Cole deciding that her next album\u00a0will be comprised of Northumbrian fishing shanties.&quot; While Israel scratched its head, visiting British pirate DJ Grant Goddard happened upon one of Haza&apos;s new songs and proceeded to set off a remarkable domino effect. Over at the offices of the London indie label GlobeStyle, Ben Mandelson heard the song and set about finding out more. &quot;We contacted her label in Israel and said this is an amazing record. Can we release it? And they said, &apos;Are you sure? But what about all the Eurovision stuff,\u00a0all the great pop stuff?&apos; And we said, &apos;No\u00a0thank you. We&apos;d like the Yemenite one, please.&apos;&quot; Hearing Im Nin&apos;Alu on John Peel&apos;s show, emerging DJs Coldcut sampled it for their remix of Eric B &amp; Rakim&apos;s hit Paid in Full. Then, when the identity of the voice became known, Im Nin&apos;Alu itself became a Top 20 hit. As Haza&apos;s stock rose, Aloni was keen to ensure his charge received treatment commensurate to her new status. After signing with Sire in America, he recalls, &quot;We changed our conditions to fly first class, and to always have a hotel suite, like a star.&quot; If Yemenite Songs \u2013 an album that cost \u00a35,000 to record \u2013 had become a worldwide hit, then there was no telling where its major-label successor would propel her. But Shaday, recorded in unfocused sessions in Somerset and Paris, with Brill producing, appeared to a muted reception. Subsequent albums, recorded with rock-school LA sessioneers, cost far more to make than Yemenite Songs, yet sold a fraction of that record. Still, Haza had reason to believe her star was in the ascendant. In Hollywood, she was asked to voice Yocheved, mother of Moses, in The Prince of Egypt and sing the film&apos;s keynote song, Deliver Us. When composer Hans Zimmer introduced Haza to the film&apos;s three directors, they modelled the character on her. Having resisted the overtures of men for all of her adult life, Haza advanced towards her 40th year unsure who she would settle down with. When she met and fell in love with Tel Aviv businessman Doron Ashkenazi, her professional relationship with Aloni came to an end, causing her former svengali to question Ashkenazi and his motives for pursuing Haza. At this point, the only help for which Haza was reaching out was musical. In mid-1999, Roger Armstrong, the soft-spoken Irish head of Ace records \u2013 GlobeStyle&apos;s parent company \u2013 received a phone call from her. &quot;It was unusual for her to call me. Normally, it would be Bezalel, but of course, he was no longer there.&quot; With some trepidation, Armstrong agreed to meet Haza in a London hotel where she would play him some new songs. &quot;Boy were they good. They just sparkled. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was hearing.&quot; Craig Leon, who produced those demos, agrees. &quot;She was writing her own stuff. She&apos;d said that this was what she had always been longing to do, but no one would let her.&quot; The new recordings never got released: Haza died before a deal could be done. Within hours of the news of Haza&apos;s death, the recriminations began. Many Israelis believed Ashkenazi \u2013 who died following a drug overdose in April 2001 \u2013 infected Haza with the Aids virus. His family have never revealed whether he, too, had Aids, but, for the first time, Craig Leon relays new information. Ashkenazi, he says, told him Haza became infected from a blood transfusion in a Turkish hospital after suffering a miscarriage. And what of those final recordings? Aloni insists they shouldn&apos;t appear \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s best for people to remember her in a good way, not in a crying way&quot; \u2013 but he appears to have no legal claim over them. Craig Leon, himself unsure of their status, picks up a CD and plays me three of them. Barely adorned by instrumentation and piercingly beautiful, you can hear these songs in either of two ways. As liturgies to new love from a woman who has finally found her soulmate, or as cries of fathomless sadness from a place too dark to imagine.

Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Morocco have all tried to stem the flow of Wiki-revelations, whether the subject is corruption, authoritarianism or simply the embarrassment of having private exchanges with American interlocutors enter the public domain. There is certainly an appetite for reading state secrets. Stories about the business interests of the king of Morocco and the nepotism of the unpopular president of Tunisia \u2013 both countries normally attract little interest in Britain - generated heavy traffic on the Guardian website. But Le Monde, whose Francophone audience cares far more about the Maghreb, found its print edition banned from Morocco. Spain&apos;s El Pais, another of the five media partners in the WikiLeaks enterprise, was banned too. So was Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the independent London-based pan-Arab daily which has been following up on the stories from the start. Elaph, a Saudi-run website, was mysteriously hacked when it ran a piece about King Abdullah&apos;s sensational calls on the US to attack Iran to destroy its nuclear programme. Lebanon&apos;s Al-Akhbar , a leftist and pro-Hizbullah paper, pulled off quite a trick: it somehow obtained unauthorised leaks from the WikiLeaks cache, posting 250 US cables from eight Arab countries on its website \u2013 only to find that it was cyber-attacked (and replaced by a shimmering pink Saudi girl chat room) when it published one of two devastatingly frank documents about President Ben Ali of Tunisia, who reinforced his country&apos;s reputation as the most internet-unfriendly in the region. &quot;This is a professional job,&quot; said publisher Hassan Khalil, &quot;not the work of some geek sitting in his bedroom.&quot; In Arab countries where the media is state-controlled and even privately owned outlets exercise self-censorship to stay within well-defined red lines, outright censorship is usually a last resort. So in Egypt, for example, there was little coverage of WikiLeaked material about the presidential succession, the role of the army and Hosni Mubarak&apos;s hostility to Hamas \u2013 all highly sensitive issues, though the independent Al-Masry Al-Youm did run some cables that were passed on by Al-Akhbar in Beirut. In Syria, where newspapers are state-controlled, and the only privately owned paper is owned by a wealthy and powerful regime crony, one official insisted there was nothing discomfiting in WikiLeaks because &quot;what we say behind closed doors is exactly the same as what we advocate publicly&quot;. That&apos;s true enough when it comes to fierce hostility to any criticism of Syria&apos;s domestic affairs and its support for the &quot;resistance&quot; in Lebanon and Palestine. But the cables did show President Bashar al-Assad bluntly denying all knowledge of Scud missile deliveries to Hezbollah in the face of what the Americans called &quot;disturbing and weighty evidence to the contrary&quot;. Pro-western Jordan escaped serious embarrassment but Yemen&apos;s government faced awkward questions in parliament about its private admission of lying about US air strikes against al-Qaida \u2013 as well as concern that President Ali Abdullah Saleh&apos;s fondness for whisky would give ammunition to his Islamist critics. No one knew quite what to make of a document showing he had asked the Saudi air force to target the HQ of a senior Yemeni army commander. Overall, Arab reactions to the WikiLeaks flood have been a mixture of the dismissive and the fascinated. Some wondered why there are so few damaging revelations about Israel \u2013 giving rise to at least one conspiracy theory about collusion between Julian Assange and Binyamin Netanyahu. Others were disgusted if not really surprised at evidence of double-talk by the leaders who are quoted in the cables. In many cases, it is striking to see the contrast between well-informed, warts-and-all American assessments of the Arab autocracies and the limited efforts made by the US to promote democracy and human rights. Standing back to survey the big picture as the WikiLeaks effect fades in the Middle East, there are two other striking conclusions: one is the enormous scale of the US effort to contain Iran and its friends. The other \u2013 related \u2013 one is the sheer intimacy of US links to Israel. The much-remarked dearth of documents about the Palestinian issue reflects still relatively low US priorities, a lack of contact with Hamas-ruled Gaza, and ties with Israel that are conducted through secure defence and intelligence channels or directly with the White House. The US embassy in Tel Aviv is an inadequate prism through which to view a genuinely special relationship. No wonder that Netanyahu, unlike many Arab leaders, hasn&apos;t been too bothered by what WikiLeaks told us.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-17T15:27:37Z", "title": "How Arab governments tried to silence WikiLeaks", "sentences": ["The US embassy in Tel Aviv is an inadequate prism through which to view a genuinely special relationship."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/arab-governments-silenced-wikileaks"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Palestine holidays", "Israel", "World news", "Travel"], "article": "Dawn Lawrence pulls her wheeled suitcase up and down the narrow, cobbled streets of Bethlehem. Shouts of &quot;welcome, welcome&quot; ring out as she passes shopkeepers standing in the doors of their stores selling carved wooden biblical figures. Lawrence pays no attention to them. She has a mission: finding a place to spend the night in this Palestinian town, amid an unprecedented tourist boom. &quot;I believe in God, and he told me to come to see the place where Jesus was born,&quot; says Lawrence, 49, now in the reception of a third hotel. This is the first visit to Bethlehem for the British pilgrim, who recently worked as a missionary in the Philippines. Unlike most of her fellow tourists, Lawrence has decided to stay for several nights. Also, unlike others, she is not scared of travelling by herself in the Middle East conflict zone. &quot;I am trusting God,&quot; she says. Opposite the cemetery that sits behind the Church of the Nativity, Lawrence finds a haven. A hotel receptionist offers her a single bed for \u00a352 a night, but only until Christmas Eve. Outside, Manger Square \u2013 the heart of the city and the site of the Church of the Nativity \u2013 bustles with activity. A couple of municipal employees load a van with dozens of plastic Christmas trees. Other workers hammer at a stage where bands will perform. Crowds of families and university students wander across the square, carrying their Christmas shopping. Meanwhile, the local youngsters kill time in the sun-bathed terraces, tourist-watching and smoking narguile, the Arab water pipe. This is today&apos;s scene. But not so long ago Bethlehem was a city under curfew, where only Israeli soldiers and armed Palestinian militants dared take to the streets. Where only humanitarian workers and the most committed pilgrims had the courage to venture. But a radical improvement in the security situation over the past few years, after the end of the second intifada, has reversed the trend and allowed tourists to pour in. The problem, say the authorities, is that Bethlehem&apos;s boom is not a very profitable one \u2013 at least not for many Palestinians. Most visitors spend too little time and cash in a city where the constraints of the Israeli occupation have dramatically diminished sources of employment, apart from tourism. The majority of visitors come by bus, spend a couple of hours in the church and then return to Israel, where they spend most of their holiday money. &quot;It is true that this is a record year and that we have never received so many tourists in Bethlehem. The problem is that we only get 10% of the tourist revenues. The rest stays in Israel,&quot; complains Palestinian tourism minister Khouloud Daibes. A total of 1.4 million people have visited Jesus&apos;s birthplace this year, a 60% increase compared with last year. According to the minister, 70%-80% of this year&apos;s tourists are one-day visitors. The fate of Bethlehem as a tourist destination is inevitably linked to Israel. There is no Palestinian airport, which means visitors either have to land in Tel Aviv or arrive from Jordan and cross an Israeli-controlled border. Daibes says one of the consequences is that Israeli operators dominate the tourist itineraries. &quot;There is a big demand to visit Palestine as part of Holy Land trips, but there is also a very aggressive promotional strategy by the Israelis to shorten the stay of tourists in Bethlehem,&quot; says Daibes. &quot;The guides tell them that this is not a safe place and take them back to Jerusalem as fast as possible. The fact that the government does not allow Israeli citizens to enter Palestinian towns, along with the checkpoints and the restrictions of movement also increases the feeling of insecurity.&quot; Rafi Ben-Hur, deputy director general of the Israeli ministry of tourism, strongly rejects the criticism. &quot;We don&apos;t know what kind of campaign she is talking about. We do a lot to promote Bethlehem. I believe in collaboration with the Palestinians. It&apos;s in our mutual interest.&quot; He adds that the two sides have launched a pilot project in which they have granted 200 permits for Israeli guides to work in Bethlehem and walk the clients into the hotels. Paradoxically, Bethlehem suffers from having both too few and too many tourists. The volatile political situation means that, so far, hardly any big international chains have decided to build hotels in the city. Meanwhile, as Lawrence found out today, family businesses are struggling to meet the demand at peak times such as Christmas. &quot;We are still waiting for a breakthrough in infrastructure investment,&quot; says Ben-Hur. Along with the establishment of law and order on the West Bank, the arrival of Russian tourists is another driver of the Bethlehem boom. Indeed, the inflow of Russians is one of the few collateral benefits of Israel&apos;s control of the tourist flux to the occupied Palestinian territories. In September 2008, the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, finally managed to push through a visa exemption for Russians travelling to Israel. The move triggered a massive rise in visitors not only to Israel but also to places of pilgrimage such as Bethlehem. Almost a quarter of visitors to Bethlehem this year have been Russian. In response, the Palestinian government has embarked on an ambitious programme to teach Russian to local guides and is attending tourism fairs in Moscow three times a year. Next month, a Russian museum and guest house will be inaugurated in Jericho, which is nearby. Back in Manger Square, at the door of the Nativity church, Anya Stonlake, a Russian contemporary art dealer who lives in London, is chatting to two priests with whom she and her family are travelling. Stonlake, a Russian Orthodox woman who covers her head to go into the church, explains the visa issue &quot;makes a big difference, because there are many other countries where visas are required for the Russians, so it suddenly became very easy to come here&quot;. Minutes after Stonlake&apos;s family leaves, one of several recent VIP visitors drops in on the church. Lithuanian prime minister Andrius Kubilius and his entourage arrive in a fleet of black Mercedes, creating a stir among the local children, who decide to play policemen and remove steel barriers to make room for the convoy. Life in Bethlehem has long revolved around Manger Square. Coffee houses, falafel stands, traditional sweetshops and the local market are all working at full speed. The souvenir shops have a less certain income. While the owners of the stores that receive the tourist buses from Israel become millionaires, those that are not on the same circuit struggle to survive. &quot;The guides don&apos;t give freedom to the tourists to walk around because they think we Palestinians are dangerous people,&quot; says Angela Giacaman, who sells figures her brother carves from olive wood. &quot;They go from the bus to the church and from there to a prearranged shop where the agents get a 40% commission. They treat the tourists like flocks of sheep. They even tell them which toilet to go to,&quot; she adds. Rami Kassis realised 15 years ago that there are many tourists who don&apos;t feel comfortable with this cattle- herding approach, even in conflict zones like the Middle East. He founded his Alternative Tourism Group: &quot;Our focus is not to show the religious or historic sites. We try to show the other side of Palestine and to facilitate contacts with the local population, NGOs, refugees from the camps\u2026 there are many people who want to learn about our reality,&quot; he says. For most &quot;alternative&quot; tourists, the main attraction is the 8m wall on three sides of Bethlehem. The wall is covered with graffiti, often consisting of political slogans left by tourists and activists from around the world. &quot;Tear down this wall&quot;, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; and &quot;Give me freedom&quot; share concrete surface with large pieces by British graffiti artist Banksy. Israel says it built the barrier to prevent the entry of suicide bombers into the country, while Palestinians bitterly complain of being cut off from Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank. Only those Palestinians who have been granted permits can cross the wall through a checkpoint. The majority of the permit holders are Palestinian builders, many of whom lay bricks in the Jewish settlements. Musa, a Spaniard from Barcelona, is busy redecorating a section of the wall with brightly coloured sprays. She arrived the day before with a group of female artists who plan to spend a week in Bethlehem. &quot;I had read about the wall, but you only realise what it means once you see it. People here are encircled like in a fish bowl,&quot; she says. A few yards from Musa, Palestinian workers cross the checkpoint on their way home after spending the day on an Israeli building site. They carry empty lunch boxes and look tired. Their home town is experiencing a tourist boom, but they do not seem to notice.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-26T00:05:56Z", "title": "The Holy Land is on a tourism high", "sentences": ["There is no Palestinian airport, which means visitors either have to land in Tel Aviv or arrive from Jordan and cross an Israeli-controlled border."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/26/bethlehem-tourism-boom-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Protest", "World news"], "article": "The prominent Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak was todaysentenced to three months in prison by a Tel Aviv court for taking part in a bicycle demonstration against the blockade of Gaza almost three years ago. Human rights activists condemned the prison term, saying it was an unusually harsh punishment for a charge that usually results in a non-custodial sentence. Pollak, 28, is one of the founders of a leftwing Israeli group called Anarchists against the Wall, which demonstrates with Palestinian activists in the occupied territories. In January 2008, he participated, along with 30 others, in a &quot;critical mass bicycle ride&quot; through Tel Aviv. During the demonstration, police arrested Pollak but allowed the rest of the activists to continue with the protest, his lawyer said. Pollak remained defiant after sentencing. &quot;I have no doubt that what we did was right and, if anything, not sufficient considering what is being done in our name,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;If I have to go to prison to resist the occupation, I\u00a0will do it gladly.&quot; Pollak described his sentence as &quot;part of the general deterioration in the right to dissent from the general Israeli discourse regarding the occupation&quot;. His lawyer, Gaby Lasky, who defends many activists arrested while protesting against Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank, said the sentence was unusual. &quot;It is not common that someone found guilty of illegal assembly will be sent to prison,&quot; said Lasky, who has worked in this field for eight years. &quot;We are in the midst of a high wave of detentions of activists,&quot; she added. &quot;The criminalisation of leftwing demonstrations is a policy these days&quot;. An official at the court of first instance in Tel Aviv, who asked to remain anonymous, said it was extremely rare for judges to hand down a jail sentence in an illegal assembly case. The official pointed out, however, that Pollak had three previous convictions, including one for &quot;distraction of order and vandalism&quot;, and a three-month suspended sentence for demonstrating against the West Bank separation barrier. The Israeli police and the ministry of justice declined to comment. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel criticised the sentence. &quot;Placing Pollak behind bars because of his participation in the critical mass bike ride is an extreme punishment and an unusually harsh measurement,&quot; Dan Yakir, the organisation&apos;s chief legal adviser, said in a statement. &quot;The entire affair raises suspicion that Pollak was personally targeted because of his views in an attempt to silence him and prevent him from partaking in various acts of protest.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-12-27T17:08:30Z", "title": "Israeli activist imprisoned for protest against Gaza blockade", "sentences": ["The prominent Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak was todaysentenced to three months in prison by a Tel Aviv court for taking part in a bicycle demonstration against the blockade of Gaza almost three years ago.", "In January 2008, he participated, along with 30 others, in a &quot;critical mass bicycle ride&quot; through Tel Aviv.", "An official at the court of first instance in Tel Aviv, who asked to remain anonymous, said it was extremely rare for judges to hand down a jail sentence in an illegal assembly case."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/27/israeli-activist-imprisoned-demonstration-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Judaism", "Religion"], "article": "A letter signed by the wives of 27 prominent Israeli rabbis urging Jewish women not to date or work with Arab men has drawn a furious reaction from politicians and religious leaders. Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, said the petition was &quot;part of a wave of racism, which threatens to carry Israeli society away to dark and dangerous places&quot;. The letter follows the release of a document by dozens of rabbis this month which ruled that Israeli Jews should not let or sell their properties to Arabs. The ruling, signed by some of the most prominent religious leaders in the country, was condemned by the Israeli government, including the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. However, a poll published this week revealed significant support for the rabbis&apos; position among the Israeli Jewish population. The letter, by a group of influential wives from the Lehava organisation, states that Israeli Jewish girls should not mingle with gentiles. To that end, the &quot;daughters of Israel&quot; \u2013 as the letter refers to the young women \u2013 should also avoid places such as supermarkets and workplaces frequented by non-Jewish men. &quot;There are quite a few Arab workers who give themselves Hebrew names. Yusef turns into Yosef, Samir turns into Sami, and Awabad turns into Ami. They ask to be close to you, try to find favour with you, and give you all the attention in world \u2026 [but] the moment you are in their hands, in their village, under their control, everything changes,&quot; the letter states, according to translations published in the Israeli press. Lehava has launched initiatives in the past to fight against the &quot;assimilation&quot; of Jews. It organised a demonstration this month in which hundreds of supporters protested against the presence of Arab citizens in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv. Rabbi Mauricio Balter, the president of the Rabbinical Assembly of Masroti, the Conservative Judaism movement in Israel, condemned the letter, saying it was &quot;contrary to Judaism&quot; and showed a &quot;touch of racism and xenophobia&quot;. He added: &quot;Although in Judaism we promote marriage between Jews, we do not consider it a problem working with or having friends who are non-Jews.&quot; The conservative movement is the second-largest in world Judaism but represents only a minority of Jews living in Israel. A poll published this week showed 44% of Israeli Jews support the rabbis&apos; ruling this month banning the renting of apartments to non-Jews. The survey, by the Truman Institute of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah, also revealed that 48% opposed such a ban.

Political leaders and analysts praised the ruling, saying it showed that the law applied to everyone, including the president. But many expressed shame and embarrassment that a former head of state had been found guilty of such serious offences. Iranian-born Katsav, 65, abandoned a plea bargain two years ago that could have kept him out of jail, saying he wanted to prove his innocence. The panel of judges on the Tel Aviv district court said, however, that he had lied in his account of the events. The sexual offences took place during Katsav&apos;s terms as president and as minister of tourism. Complainant A accused him of raping her on two occasions, while complainants H and L accused him of sexual harassment. The verdict confirmed all the three accusations. Katsav was acquitted only of charges that he had harassed a witness. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said it was &quot;a sad day for the state of Israel and its residents&quot;. He added: &quot;Today the court conveyed two clear-cut messages, that all are equal before the law and that every woman has exclusive rights to her body&quot;. Under Israeli law, rape is punishable by a minimum of four and a maximum of 16 years in prison. Katsav was also charged with obstruction of justice. Although the full verdict has still not been disclosed, his lawyers announced that they would appeal to the supreme court. Leon Amiras, the deputy chairman of the Israeli Bar Association said: &quot;Even if they appeal, I would not expect any substantial change in the sentencing.&quot; He added: &quot;Legal experts calculate he could end up spending 10 years in prison.&quot; The rightwing former president has portrayed himself as a victim of ethnic discrimination. Israeli political life has long been dominated by Jews of European origin, while Katsav and many of his supporters are of Middle Eastern origin. Katsav became the eighth president of Israel in 2000 and was forced to resign in disgrace in July 2007, after the accusations emerged in 2006. The judge, George Karra, who read the core part of the verdict at the Tel Aviv court, said Katsav started harassing A, a former worker in the ministry of tourism, when she rejected his sexual propositions. &quot;No basis was found to the claim that the relations took place with her agreement,&quot; he said. The court added that Katsav&apos;s version was &quot;riddled with lies&quot;. The panel of three judges believed witnesses who confirmed A&apos;s version of events. &quot;All the testimonies based on what A said contradict the defendant&apos;s claims that this was an invention born of emotion.&quot; &quot;Seven years ago I first met Moshe Katsav and I hope today marks the end of the seven worst years of my life,&quot; said A in a statement after the verdict. The judges also said Katsav had manipulated and withheld information by presenting edited tapes as evidence that A had not been raped. Katsav attended the reading of the verdict accompanied by his lawyer, his son and his brother, but not his wife, the Israeli press reported. Katsav&apos;s son Boaz said in a statement: &quot;This is a hard day for the family. We will continue to be proud of our father, the eighth president of the state of Israel. Let the people of Israel know, throughout the generations, that this trial does not belong to Israel&apos;s ethics, when judges decide based on their feelings.&quot; Outside court, women&apos;s rights groups cheered. However, in Kiryat Malachi, Katsav&apos;s hometown, some neighbours voiced anger at the verdict, and said they still supported the former president. Rami Atia told a reporter for the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth: &quot;Katsav was slaughtered in public. How can it be that the woman remembered to file a complaint after seven years? It&apos;s a sad day for Kiryat Malachi, but I&apos;ll continue to support Katsav, because I know for a fact that he&apos;s not guilty.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-12-30T09:21:00Z", "title": "Israeli court convicts former president of rape", "sentences": ["The panel of judges on the Tel Aviv district court said, however, that he had lied in his account of the events.", "The judge, George Karra, who read the core part of the verdict at the Tel Aviv court, said Katsav started harassing A, a former worker in the ministry of tourism, when she rejected his sexual propositions."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/israeli-court-convicts-former-president-rape"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Liverpool", "Rangers", "Aston Villa", "Kenny Dalglish", "Bolton Wanderers", "West Bromwich Albion"], "article": "The former Liverpool defender Avi Cohen, who has died from injuries sustained in a\u00a0motorcycle accident, aged 54, was the first Israeli footballer to play for an English club in the top division. Cohen scored one of Liverpool&apos;s goals \u2013 as well as an own goal at the Kop end \u2013 in the decisive 4-1 victory over Aston Villa that won them the League championship in May 1980. Cohen&apos;s goal, scored with a low, angled right-foot shot, also had a special relevance as the only one he scored for Liverpool during his two years at\u00a0Anfield. Avraham Cohen was born in Cairo. He\u00a0spent several seasons at the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv before he attracted the interest of the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley. The 6ft 1in leftback joined Liverpool in the summer of\u00a01979 for a fee of \u00a3200,000 and made his debut that September. His powers as a defender were perhaps outweighed by his personal charm. &quot;He quickly integrated himself into the football club when he joined us and spent a lot of time learning English, which really made him popular,&quot; said his former team-mate Kenny Dalglish. &quot;He was well liked by all the lads and although he didn&apos;t spend a long time at the club, he left his mark.&quot; Such was Liverpool&apos;s strength in those years, it was difficult for Cohen to find a place in the side. He caused controversy when he decided to play for Liverpool against Southampton in September 1980 on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. The Israeli press gave Cohen a torrid time and, to add to the furore, he gave away a goal in the game with a\u00a0weak pass. After 24 appearances for Liverpool, Cohen returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1981. He later spent a season in Glasgow with Rangers (1987-88) under the management of another former Liverpool player, Graeme Souness, and had stints at Sheffield United and Huddersfield Town. He made 64 international appearances for Israel and captained the national side 33 times. After playing for the Israeli team Maccabi Netanya, he became the club&apos;s manager and subsequently took charge of other Israeli clubs, including Maccabi Herzliya. He had recently served as the head of the Israeli Football Players&apos; Association. Cohen&apos;s son Tamir is also an Israeli international and plays for Bolton Wanderers. After scoring in the Boxing Day match against West Bromwich Albion, his Bolton clubmate Johan Elmander held up a shirt inscribed: &quot;Get\u00a0well soon Avi Cohen.&quot; He is survived by his wife and three children. \u2022 Avraham Cohen, footballer and manager, born 14 November 1956; died 29 December 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-12-30T18:30:13Z", "title": "Avi Cohen obituary", "sentences": ["He\u00a0spent several seasons at the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv before he attracted the interest of the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley.", "After 24 appearances for Liverpool, Cohen returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1981."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/dec/30/avi-cohen-obituary"}], "docs": 228, "sentences": 312}
