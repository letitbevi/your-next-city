Airline staff queued up to go on strike, collapsed travel companies left clients stranded around the world, and holiday bookings wobbled as consumer confidence dipped. Mother Nature intervened in April as Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano spewed its innards across a\u00a0considerable chunk of the northern hemisphere, costing the airline industry $1.7bn in lost revenue. Then, predictably, Britain&apos;s transport system froze to a standstill as the snow arrived in December. But there are reasons to be cheerful in 2011. TripAdvisor&apos;s annual Travel Trends survey \u2013 which sampled 6,000 users \u2013 has revealed that Brits are hesitantly positive about their travelling prospects, with one in 10 planning to holiday more often this year. The Great British &quot;staycation&quot; also looks to be on the wane, with just 38% of those surveyed planning to stay at home for their holiday compared with 45% last year. Voluntourism and adventure travel are set to rise in popularity, our appetite for the Middle East is expected to grow apace with new flights to the region, and long-haul travel is fighting its way back against the dominance of European city breaks and mid-haul sun-seeking. 1. EasyJet enters Jordan     Photograph: PA    Spearheaded by the emergence of Dubai as one of the world&apos;s busiest flight hubs (the airport&apos;s capacity surpassed JFK last September), and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council&apos;s prediction that the region&apos;s tourist growth will outstrip any other in 2011, British holidaymakers are expected to pour into the Middle East. Having entered the region with its first flights to Tel Aviv in 2009, easyJet is adding Jordan to its portfolio, with flights into Amman scheduled to begin in March, from a lead-in price of \u00a3105.98 return.

Trailblazing in Nepal     Photograph: Rex Features    A recent TUI study reported British travellers are more likely to book an adventure travel trip over the next three years. For those looking to sate their inner explorer this year, a groundbreaking new trail in Nepal should do the job. Australian Robin Boustead has spent 152 days traversing a series of routes winding beneath the world&apos;s highest peaks over the past few years, meticulously mapping the Great Himalayan Trail (thegreathimalayatrail.org) \u2013 the first continuous trail across the Nepalese Himalayan arc from Kanchenjunga on the eastern border, through the foothills of Everest, concluding on the Tibetan border in the west. The inaugural public expedition, led by Boustead himself, begins in February and will cost an eye-watering \u00a320,500 for the entire trip. But World Expeditions has broken the trail down into a handful of sections that can be &quot;hopped&quot; on to from \u00a32,350 for 18 days.Details worldexpeditions.co.uk 3. Airbnb in Asia     Photograph: Alamy    Airbnb.com, the peer-to-peer B&amp;B network that invites tourists into locals&apos; spare bedrooms and apartments, grew phenomenally last year and has set its sights on Asia in 2011. While the network \u2013 and similar networks such as iStopOver and Crashpadder \u2013 has developed huge bases in Europe and North America (the site boasts more than 4,000 listings in New York), a promotional drive has seen the company&apos;s portfolio in Asia increase significantly. Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul have seen notable additions, but Shanghai (pictured)\u2013 helped by its large expat community \u2013 is leading the pack with a tenfold increase in the second half of last year, including sleek modern apartments in the French Concession, where the majority of the new additions are clustered.Details Shanghai rooms from \u00a36.40 per night (airbnb.com) 4.

But a Google experiment in Portland, Oregon, is seeing the technology rolled out to hundreds of caf\u00e9s and restaurants in the city in the form of stickers.

Overland from Ecuador to Colombia     Photograph: Alamy    Tourism has continued to grow year on year in Colombia, with the high-end crowd setting its sights on new boutique hotels in Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn \u2013 luxury specialists Cox &amp; Kings has earmarked the country as one of its most in-demand destinations of 2011. Provincial travel in the country, however, has stuttered due to heightened tensions with neighbouring Venezuela and Ecuador. But after a two-year hiatus due to Foreign Office advice, Dragoman Overland is returning to Colombia with an epic trip across the country. The 19-day Andean and Caribbean Trails begins in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito before heading into the market town of Otavalo and then across the border into Colombia. The route takes in the old town of Popay\u00e1n and the Purac\u00e9 National Park in the south before rising up through Andean coffee plantations and the cloud forests of the Sierra Nevada foothills, then down on to the unspoilt beaches of the Tayrona National Park before finishing in the walled city of Cartagena (pictured).Details Eight departures in 2011 from 1 June, \u00a3650 plus a\u00a0kitty of \u00a3300 (dragoman.com) 6. Mid-haul Libya     Photograph: Alamy    In 2011 short-to-medium-haul winter-sun destinations outside the eurozone, such as Turkey (where easyJet is launching two flights a week into Izmir from May) and Egypt, are predicted to remain strong, with a\u00a0fringe of more adventurous travellers trying out more unusual \u2013 but equally accessible \u2013 destinations. Libya is the last north African country to open up to European tourism and has seen steady rises in visitor numbers since the recent relaxation of visa requirements, making it possible for visitors to obtain visas at the point of entry. According to the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree travel forum, Libya is targeting 1.5 million visitors a year under its 2008-12 tourism programme.Details Explore (0845 013 1537, explore.co.uk) features three itineraries, with a five-day tour of Tripoli, ancient Sabratha and Leptis Magna from \u00a3826pp including flights 7. Turin city break     Photograph: Alamy    With the continuous growth of city-break tourism expected to be one of the key drivers in the recovery of European tourism as a whole, Brits are expected to venture beyond the usual suspects for a value-for-money urban weekend in 2011. Turin will be a\u00a0good bet, with the city acting as the focal point for a line-up of events celebrating the 150th anniversary of Italian unification (Turin was the newly united Italy&apos;s first capital from 1861-64). The recently derelict Officine Grandi Riparazioni \u2013 a vast 19th-century locomotive factory in the heart of the city \u2013 will house large temporary interactive &quot;laboratory exhibitions&quot;, and more than 300 Italian masterpieces (including works by Caravaggio, Giotto, Botticelli and Da Vinci) will be on show at the newly restored Venaria Reale, a 17th-century hunting palace on the fringes of the city.Details Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Turin from Stansted, Edinburgh and East Midlands from \u00a337.98 return.

Making an eco village in Sierra Leone     John Obey beach, Sierra Leone    Voluntourism is expected to continue to be one of the fastest-growing markets in global tourism, and a brand-new venture on a remote Sierra Leone beach is one of the most intriguing projects. As the country gears up for its 50th anniversary of political freedom in April, the John Obey beach community is the newest undertaking by Tribewanted \u2013 the social experiment that saw hundreds of volunteers build a sustainable eco resort from scratch in Fiji over the past three years. The first-footers arrived in October, and work is already under way, with locals and &quot;tribe members&quot; working together to build the first mud houses in the new eco village. The perks?

News of the potentially embarrassing UK connection emerged after Israel&apos;s Shin Bet security service said it had arrested five men charged with membership of a terrorist group and arms trafficking. But the Foreign Office said today that the consulate had been informed by the Israeli authorities that the charges had &quot;no connection&quot; with the men&apos;s jobs as maintenance workers at offices in the east Jerusalem suburb of Sheikh Jarrah.

Relations between the UK and Israel are strained owing to differences over the Middle East peace process, but an FCO spokesman in London said there were no diplomatic implications to this episode. Israeli police and the Shin Bet said yesterday that two men were indicted recently on weapons charges in connection with an alleged plot by two other Palestinians to launch a rocket attack at the Teddy stadium in Jewish west Jerusalem, home to the city&apos;s Beitar football team. The Shin Bet said the consulate employees helped the two other suspects, alleged members of Hamas, who were charged in court on Sunday, to obtain guns. No rockets were found by Israeli authorities, who said the plot had been in its preliminary stages. Planning reportedly began after Israel&apos;s war on Gaza in 2008-09. The men were arrested last November but the details were only made public yesterday. The British consulate was kept informed about the case from the start.

Wouldn&apos;t want the blighters getting involved would we Eric? \u2022 Happy days for the legendary pop producer Trevor Horn, recipient of a CBE for services to music. Many will applaud the decision, and many more have noted it. These include Linda Allan, one of the duo who famously sang the career-building chorus on his first hit with the Buggles, Video Killed the Radio Star, over 30 years ago. She reprised the role during a Prince&apos;s Trust charity concert with the producer in 2004. Well done on getting the CBE, says Linda. And is there any chance that after all these years we \u2013 the backing singers \u2013 might at last receive some royalties? Both backing singers have also, we learn, lodged a claim with the music licensing authorities relating to the more recent sampled use of the song by the US artist will.i.am. They live in hope. But alas, Trevor tells us, it isn&apos;t that straightforward. &quot;I don&apos;t own the copyright to Video Killed the Radio Star,&quot; he says. &quot;Island/Universal own the rights to the record and the song.&quot; Linda&apos;s &quot;beautiful&quot; contribution is not in doubt, he adds, but &quot;when we recorded the track, she was paid a session fee by Island Records&quot;. The will.i.am sample is also a tricky issue. &quot;The section of Video Killed the Radio Star it samples is the &apos;oh-a oh&apos; vocal riff from the first verse,&quot; says Trevor. Another backing singer altogether did that bit. Nonsense, says Linda. Thirty-two years ago, but still so many loose ends. Might there be time to sort it all out before he goes to see the Queen? \u2022 Happy days too for Paul Scriven, the leader of Sheffield city council. True, he failed to get elected to parliament in May. And yes, it is the case that the city missed out on much-needed jobs when Nick Clegg and his Con-Dem compadres cancelled the Labour government&apos;s loan to the giant firm Forgemasters. But you can&apos;t have everything. And everyone agrees that Scriven does look jolly good in the music video he mimed to drum up business for his friend, the owner of a local hotel. Scriven didn&apos;t get paid for his role in the training video. It was just a favour, he says. But his portrayal of a tired, harassed businessman, shirt hanging out, embraced by female receptionists, definitely shows some talent. So many people in the city will soon be looking for alternative careers. For Scriven, that&apos;s not a problem. \u2022 Where goes London, there goes the nation. Thus the question for Labour&apos;s strategists is clear. How can Ken Livingstone depose Boris Johnson? It won&apos;t be easy. For all his faults, the blond one has a steady humour and remarkably healthy poll ratings. Still, Livingstone, after a scratchy end to his last mayoral term, is doing his best to be affable; he has got himself a dog. The Labour candidate told listeners to his LBC phone-in show that the labrador puppy was to be called Cuba.

The exchange, a protected source told US diplomats, came when the Iranian president took what it calls a &quot;surprisingly liberal posture&quot; in a January 2010 meeting to discuss the next steps on dealing with the opposition protests. Ahmadinejad suggested more personal and social freedoms, including freedom of the press, in order to help diffuse the situation.  According to source, Ahmedinejad&apos;s statements infuriated Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali Jafari, who exclaimed &quot;You are wrong! (In fact) it is YOU who created this mess! And now you say give more freedom to the press?!&quot; Source said that Jafari then slapped Ahmedinejad in the face, causing an uproar and an immediate call for a break in the meeting, which was never resumed  \u2022 Norway&apos;s Aftenposten was leaked the cables last month and has been publishing. One cable revealed that Berry Smutny, the CEO of Germany&apos;s leading satellite manufacturer, had told US diplomats he believed France was responsible for more industrial espionage in Germany than either Russia or China.  Smutny frankly said &quot;France is the evil empire stealing technology and Germany knows this&quot;, but Germany&apos;s decentralized government is not willing to do much about it. Going on at length of his despise of the French, Smutny said French IPR [intellectual property rights] espionage is so bad that the total damage done to the German economy is greater than that inflicted by China or Russia  The meeting was part of a well-documented effort to get the US interested in a proposed German network of reconnaissance satellites, despite strong opposition from France.  The cables have caused a stir, as the Foreign Policy blog puts it, since Germany&apos;s BND spy agency said the satellites &quot;would be operated by a &apos;commercial entity&apos; created specifically for this purpose, but with tasking managed/controlled/coordinated by BND.&quot; DLR, Germany&apos;s aerospace agency, has denied this is a spy satellite system; it said the purpose was to &quot;transmit data for public services, for example for crisis management in natural catastrophes.&quot; \u2022\u00a0And - in case you missed it - here is a Newsweek.com gallery of how Julian Assange spent Christmas.

The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the death of Jawaher Abu Rahma last weekend as an &quot;Israeli crime carried out by the occupation army against our helpless nation&quot;. In contrast, unnamed Israeli military sources told Yedioth Ahronoth, a mass circulation newspaper: &quot;This is the new Muhammad al-Dura story and an attempt to delegitimise Israel.&quot; Al-Dura was the 12-year-old boy shot dead in Gaza in 2000 while cowering behind his father, who tried to shield him during a gunbattle between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants. Images of the terrified boy became a symbol of the Second Intifada. Abu Rahma, 36, died on Saturday after collapsing as she watched a protest against Israel&apos;s separation barrier in Bil&apos;in. Youths had begun throwing stones at soldiers who responded by firing CS gas canisters. According to witnesses, Abu Rahma began vomiting, convulsing and foaming at the mouth. She died in hospital in Ramallah the next day. Her death has afforded extra potency as it followed that of her brother, Bassem, who was killed 20 months earlier after being hit by a high-velocity teargas projectile during a similar protest. Another brother, Ashraf, was injured in the foot in July 2008 in the village of Na&apos;alin after an Israeli soldier fired a rubber-coated steel bullet at point-blank range. The incident was captured on video. The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, branded Abu Rahma&apos;s death a &quot;war crime&quot;. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening, at which 11 activists were arrested. The Israeli Defence Force opened an investigation into Abu Rahma&apos;s death. But on Monday, during anonymous briefings to Israeli journalists, military sources questioned accounts from the family, witnesses and the medical authorities. &quot;We did not kill her, there is no proof,&quot; senior officers in the IDF Central Command told Yedioth Ahronoth. &quot;This entire story is very strange. The Palestinian reports are full of contradictions. The medical reports were fabricated and withheld from us. We believe she suffered from cancer and that she took unusually high doses of medication.&quot; The military sources suggested Abu Rahma may not have been present at the protest and that she suffered from a pre-existing condition likely to have caused her death. The family&apos;s supporters issued a detailed rebuttal of the IDF claims, backed by documentation, and said the military was waging a smear campaign. None of the witnesses to the incident claimed Abu Rahma took part in Friday&apos;s demonstration, but that she had watched from a distance. Her mother, Soubhiya, has said she was with her daughter on a hill at the edge of the village when they were enveloped in teargas. &quot;Soon after that she vomited and collapsed,&quot; she said in a statement to the Popular Struggle Co-ordination Committee. &quot;We took her to the nearest road, and from there she was evacuated by ambulance to the hospital where she remained until her death. &quot; Islam Abu Rahma, a family member who was with Jawaher, also gave testimony: &quot;The wind moved the gas in our direction, making our eyes itch and tear up. After that [Jawaher] began to cough and foam at the mouth. Soon after that she became weak and lay down on the ground \u2026 She became terribly weak, vomited violently and foamed at the mouth. She was having difficulty breathing and lost her sense of direction.&quot; The IDF has questioned the hospital records concerning Abu Rahma&apos;s treatment. One medical report said a blood sample was taken at 2.45pm, but a separate form said she was only admitted at 3.20pm, they said. According to the family, the sample was taken in the hospital emergency room before her admission shortly afterwards to intensive care. The military&apos;s claims that Abu Rahma was suffering from asthma and leukaemia, which could have caused or contributed to her death, have been vigorously disputed. Mohammed Eidh, the director of the Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah where Abu Rahma was taken, said she &quot;died from lung failure caused by teargas inhalation, leading to a heart attack&quot;. An official report, signed by Eidh and two other doctors, logged her symptoms and vital signs following &quot;unknown gas inhalation&quot;. She had &quot;no history of chronic disease&quot;, it said. Abu Rahma&apos;s family and doctors said she recently had an inner-ear infection, for which she was given a CT scan, the results of which were normal. The IDF said the gas used in last Friday&apos;s demonstration was identical to that used in previous protests, and is considered non-lethal in an open-air environment. According to Mohammed Khatib, a member of Bil&apos;in&apos;s Popular Co-ordinating Committee which organises the weekly protests against the barrier, the Israeli army was &quot;trying to evade its responsibility for Jawaher&apos;s death with lies and invented narratives that have no basis&quot;. Michael Sfard, an Israeli lawyer representing the Abu Rahma family, said the IDF had committed a &quot;cowardly act by anonymously spreading lies without any evidence&quot;. He said he had no confidence that an internal military inquiry, based solely on the testimony of soldiers, would establish the truth of the circumstances of Abu Rahma&apos;s death. &quot;This is a proven way to whitewash what happened.&quot; The IDF issued an official statement on Wednesday saying the inquiry into Abu Rahma&apos;s death had yet to be completed. It added: &quot;The initial information raises questions as to the reliability of Palestinian reports. The medical reports received from the Palestinians also raise many questions and doubts. A number of scenarios have been posited, among them the possibility that Abu Rahma&apos;s death was entirely unrelated to the demonstration last Friday.&quot; An army spokesman told the Guardian: &quot;There&apos;s something weird about the whole situation and there are many questions about the circumstances of her death.&quot; He said he had &quot;no idea&quot; how long the inquiry would take &quot;but we hope for answers as soon as possible&quot;. Twelve-year-old martyr On 30 September 2000, on the second day of the second intifada, Muhammad al-Dura, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, was caught up in gunfire in the Gaza Strip and killed as he cowered against a wall. His father, Jamal, who was also struck by several bullets, tried to protect his son as they sought cover. The shooting and the child&apos;s evident distress were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for a French TV station, and were broadcast around the world. At the end of the clip, Dura is seen slumped over his father&apos;s legs. The Arab world hailed the boy as a martyr. His image appeared on stamps and streets were named after him. The Israeli army initially apologised for the killing, but then backtracked after conducting a controversial investigation in which it cleared itself and blamed Palestinian gunfire for the deaths. Despite claims by some pro-Israel groups that the child is still alive and the incident was staged by the Palestinians, Dura&apos;s death remains an abiding symbol in the Arab world and beyond.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-06T17:44:36Z", "title": "Israeli military and Palestinians clash over death of West Bank woman", "sentences": ["Hundreds of people joined a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening, at which 11 activists were arrested."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/06/abu-rahma-teargas-death-west-bank"}, {"tags": ["Glee", "Television", "Comedy", "US television", "Comedy"], "article": "As the sun rises each morning, millions of Gleeks awake, yawn, and feel their jazz hands twitch. In the Buckinghamshire town of Amersham, the Glee version of Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos; rings out around Neil Kitchin-Wilson&apos;s bedroom, the distinctive alarm launching a day that will likely involve avid viewing, listening and rehearsals, before finishing with a triumphant performance in the tribute act, the Glee Club, that has taken him from Leeds to Edinburgh to Limerick. The Glee Club performed at a notoriously ferocious student night where they were warned to watch out for booing and bottle-throwing. They needn&apos;t have worried. The response was rapturous. &quot;When we did Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos; the crowd was actually singing the backing vocals,&quot; says Kitchin-Wilson, laughing. &quot;We thought: surely you can&apos;t know all of this? Surely you can&apos;t be as obsessed as us?&quot; You don&apos;t have to look hard to find Glee fans: a high kick in a built-up area is sure to hit one or two. The story of bright-eyed, bubble-haired teacher Will Schuester and his efforts to mould a group of fabulous but troubled teenagers into a show choir has been so successful it has attracted comparisons to Beatlemania. Millions of songs from the musical comedy have been downloaded since its 2009 debut, extra dates have had to be added to the cast&apos;s British stadium tour this summer, and the stars have performed at the White House and on Oprah. There is a glut of Glee merchandise in the works \u2013 karaoke machines, board games, clothing \u2013 and the first Glee novel was published last August. It isn&apos;t only a marketing machine. Glee \u2013 which returns to UK screens for a second series on Monday \u2013 has also achieved a rare feat for a TV show: influencing real lives. The fans are famously devoted (more than 10 million throng on the show&apos;s Facebook page) and they have taken up its entreaty to sing and dance their way through life. Show choirs have started all over the world, and there have been Glee flash mobs \u2013 bursts of formation dancing \u2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Tel Aviv, Rome, Madrid, Brighton. Glee&apos;s tone has been compared to US comedies such as Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives \u2013 shows built on extreme irony, ridiculous plotting, crazed innuendo and camp. Enter this world, and you&apos;re asked to believe that Schuester could fail to notice, for months, that his wife&apos;s &quot;pregnancy&quot; is just a cushion stuffed up her jumper. It&apos;s a world in which a student admits to her school counsellor that she tried to be bulimic, &quot;but I don&apos;t have a gag reflex&quot; and is told: &quot;When you&apos;re older, that will turn out to be a\u00a0gift.&quot; Perhaps most importantly, Glee is a world where Sue Sylvester can thrive. Played by Jane Lynch, Sylvester is an amalgam of every PE teacher anyone was ever tormented by, an icon of frightful, amassed power. She is a woman who starts almost every other sentence with the phrase &quot;you think this is hard?&quot; before adding &quot;try waterboarding&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m passing a gallstone as we speak. That&apos;s hard!&quot; The kids who join the Glee club at William McKinley high school in Lima, Ohio, all feel lost. There&apos;s the dignified and dramatic Kurt Hummel, who was thrown into a bin by bullies in the first episode \u2013 but only after he&apos;d insisted on removing his designer jacket. There&apos;s the belting, lightly bruised bravado of Mercedes Jones, who made her feelings clear when she declared: &quot;I&apos;m Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 I ain&apos;t no Kelly Rowland.&quot; There&apos;s Quinn Fabray, head cheerleader and president of the school&apos;s celibacy club \u2013 until she got pregnant. &quot;I wanted to talk about the underdog element in society,&quot; co-creator Ryan Murphy has said, &quot;the pregnant girl, the gay kid, the kid in a wheelchair, the African-American girl who&apos;s one of five black kids in their school. I wanted to give voices to people who don&apos;t have voices.&quot; The genius of basing a show on misfits is, of course, that everyone has, at some point, felt out of place, misunderstood, under-appreciated. Egan Orion, who organised a Glee flashmob in Seattle last April, says that what makes the characters so affecting is that &quot;they&apos;re all uncomfortable in their own skin and trying to find their way in the world, and that resonates with people \u2013 and not just young people. That sense of being the awkward kid pervades our whole lives. Glee makes people feel there&apos;s a place for them.&quot; Not only does Glee promise a place for misfits, it suggests they can be heroic. At the heart of the show is Rachel Berry who is, as Sue Sylvester says, &quot;the kind of girl who wants things too badly&quot;. In many ways, her yearning makes her monstrous. But it also makes her highly recognisable. Is there any quality more fundamental to adolescence \u2013 with its quarries of unrequited love and solitary self doubt \u2013 than yearning? When I go to a London hotel to meet Chris Colfer, who plays Kurt, and Amber Riley, who plays Mercedes, there is a crowd of teenage fans gathered outside, notable for their stripey jumpers, smudged eyeliner and barely contained devotion. Colfer and Riley seem very similar to their characters, if just a bit more confident, and a bit more exhausted. (Riley keeps yawning, which doesn&apos;t seem surprising when Colfer tells me they work 16\u00a0hours a day, Monday to Friday \u2013 and then do press and photo shoots at the\u00a0weekend.) Both claim to have been teenage misfits to some degree. Riley says that, in high school, &quot;I didn&apos;t really fit in anywhere, and I didn&apos;t know why. But I just wanted to get through it. I didn&apos;t really care about having friends \u2013 I have a huge family, so they were my friends \u2013 and I just kept my head down, stayed out of trouble, did my work, and graduated.&quot; She&apos;s now in her mid-20s and has appeared in small roles in other TV programmes, but Colfer, just 20, was cast in Glee straight out of high school. He says he was &quot;a Rachel Berry, definitely, at school . . . and a complete social llama. I wasn&apos;t really a horse, but I wasn&apos;t really a goat. I\u00a0mean, I was kind of a camel, but I\u00a0didn&apos;t really fit in with anything.&quot; He pauses, to clarify: &quot;I wasn&apos;t spitting and crapping all over the place like a llama.&quot; Colfer says he had a good idea the show would be successful on reading the script, &quot;because I was one of those kids. I was a total theatre, performing arts nerd, so I was so happy to read about kids that were just like me.&quot; Being in a school choir used to be &quot;very stupid and sad&quot;, he says. &quot;Now, because of the show, it&apos;s not, which kind of makes me bitter. Now it&apos;s the cool thing, and I feel like, &apos;well, you&apos;re welcome America! You&apos;re welcome world!&apos;&quot; Glee has managed to make show choirs cool, partly because of the music chosen by Murphy, which includes everything from 70s hits by Kiss and Queen, to tracks by Lady Gaga, a whole episode based around Madonna songs, and heartfelt numbers from musicals such as Gypsy and Dreamgirls. Suzanne Gardner, who runs the website Gleeks United from her home in Toronto, and recently published Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;: The Unofficial Guide to Glee, says: &quot;The blend has always been perfect. There are so few times where I&apos;ve thought, &apos;maybe that wasn&apos;t the right song for that spot.&apos;&quot; But it&apos;s not just the song choices that are clever \u2013 it&apos;s the way the show uses them. It&apos;s only when they&apos;re singing that the characters are really able to be themselves. When Rachel sings Don&apos;t Rain on My Parade or Mercedes tears through And I Am Telling You I&apos;m Not Going, their self-consciousness is stripped away completely. The most lacerating example is Colfer&apos;s performance of Rose&apos;s Turn from Gypsy. During the first series, Kurt comes out to his father \u2013 and when his father then opts to take one of his classmates to watch baseball instead of him we can almost see the pain throbbing through Kurt&apos;s skin. He stands in the school corridor, eyes misting, lips quivering. &quot;All that work and what did it get me?&quot; he sings softly, voice tight with the bitterness of rejection. The next moment he&apos;s on stage. &quot;I\u00a0had a dream,&quot; he sings, softening for a second, &quot;I dreamed it for you, Dad, it wasn&apos;t for me, Dad.&quot;Kurt starts spitting the words. &quot;Well \u2013 someone tell me, when is it my turn? Don&apos;t I get a dream for myself? Starting now it&apos;s going to be MY TURN \u2013 gangway, world, get off of my runway!&quot; The curtain goes up, and his name is spelt out in lights. &quot;Starting now, I bat a thousand, this time boys, I&apos;m taking the bows and \u2013 everything&apos;s coming up Kurt!&quot; His shoulders roll, feet kick the air. &quot;For me!&quot; he spits. &quot;For me!&quot; he stretches out the final word, arms open, energy spent. It&apos;s this moment that sums up Glee&apos;s appeal: it&apos;s funny, but there&apos;s a genuine point to that humour. It&apos;s a shield, a defence, a wall for emotion to come crashing through. No wonder Gleeks&apos; jazz hands are twitching at the thought of the second series. \u2022 Glee returns on Monday, 9pm on E4", "publicationDate": "2011-01-06T20:30:01Z", "title": "Glad to be Glee", "sentences": ["Show choirs have started all over the world, and there have been Glee flash mobs \u2013 bursts of formation dancing \u2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Tel Aviv, Rome, Madrid, Brighton."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/06/glee-chris-colfer-amber-riley"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East peace talks", "Mahmoud Abbas", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "The Mossad", "Tony Blair"], "article": "I had a longish break in the UK over Christmas and New Year, and had some catching up to do when I got back earlier this week.

But in this place nothing stands still. So settlement building is booming, there has been an increase in the number of rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel, and \u2013 in the absence of anyone else&apos;s Plan B \u2013 the Palestinians are pursuing their own.     U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during a joint press availability with Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez Merizalde Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images    A resolution condemning settlement building is expected to go to the UN security council this month. The wording of the resolution is based on statements of US policy made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (pictured left) \u2013 which should make it awkward for the Americans to veto. Further down the line could be a UN security council resolution recognising a Palestinian state \u2013 a step taken recently by Brazil and Argentina, with Uruguay to follow. Meanwhile, ultra-right foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman did come up with what he calls his Plan B: namely, forget a peace agreement any time soon, and blame the Palestinians.  This was followed by respected Haaretz columnist Aluf Benn declaring &quot;it&apos;s over&quot; for Bibi.  Some can now distinctly hear the drums of war, in Gaza, Lebanon or Iran. War is always more likely in a vacuum, which is what we seem to have now, despite Middle East envoy Tony Blair&apos;s insistence that the next few weeks could see the talks brought back from the dead. We shall see. The priapic ex-president Former president Moshe Katsav was found guilty on two counts of rape. Some have since called for him to be pardoned rather than face the &quot;humiliation&quot; of a jail sentence. Women&apos;s rights groups are not impressed by that argument.

His conviction activated an earlier suspended sentence. I asked him this week if he would be taking a pile of books to jail to while away the time; he said prisoners were allowed only scriptures. No longer Pals There appears to be a serious rupture at the top of the Palestinian faction Fatah, with former security commander Mohammed Dahlan denying he planned to stage a coup against President Mahmoud Abbas. A dispute between the two has been rumbling for a while, and Abbas has now set up an inquiry into the coup claims. Many believe Abbas to be a lame duck president; inevitably people are jockeying for position in whatever, or whoever, follows. One for the birds The Saudi authorities arrested a vulture, which they claimed was a Mossad spy after they found a GPS transmitter and a tag from Tel Aviv university attached to the bird.

Abu Rahmah, a leader of protests against Israel&apos;s separation barrier in the village of Bil&apos;in, was convicted in August of incitement and organising illegal demonstrations. This was criticised by Cathy Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, who described him as a &quot;human rights defender committed to non-violent protest against the route of the Israeli separation barrier&quot;. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa also condemned the conviction. Abu Rahmah was due to be released in November, but military prosecutors argued for him to be detained until their appeal for a longer sentence could be heard.

The young man, identified as Majid Jamali-Fash, said last night that he was hired by Israel and trained at a military base outside Tel Aviv before being dispatched to Iran as a part of network ordered to kill Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, a Tehran University particle physicist. Mohammadi was blown up outside his house last January when a remote-control bomb that had been attached to a motorcycle parked on the street detonated in a northern suburb of Tehran. Jamali-Fash claimed that he was briefed about Mohammadi in Israel and was given detailed instructions of the assassination plot &quot;in a military camp situated in the highway between Tel Aviv to Jerusalem&quot;. &quot;Two new Iranian-made motorbikes were there [In Israel] \u2026 They told me where to go, where to stop, who to call and how to do things back in Iran,&quot; he said. At the time of the assassination, it was not immediately clear whether Mohammadi was involved in Iran&apos;s nuclear activities, and speculation was rife over the reasons for his killing when it emerged that he was a supporter of the Iranian opposition. But later it was revealed that he was a member of an Iranian team at the Sesame Council, a joint project involving different countries including Israel which runs a particle accelerator in Jordan. According to the Iranian intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, who said Iran had uncovered a US-backed Israeli operation and arrested Mohammadi&apos;s assassins, Jamali-Fash was not the only one linked to Mossad. Speaking to reporters in Tehran, he said: &quot;More than 10 people were arrested in connection with different networks.&quot; He did not give any further information about the arrests. &quot;The intelligence system of the Islamic Republic of Iran has achieved a remarkable triumph and intelligence supremacy over the Zionist regime&apos;s [Israeli&apos;s] espionage system and we succeeded in identifying enemy&apos;s elements,&quot; Moslehi was quoted by the semi-official Fars news agency as saying. Moslehi&apos;s remarks came after Iran&apos;s intelligence ministry said that Mossad was behind the assassination of Mohammadi and accused &quot;certain neighbouring countries&quot; of co-operation with the Israeli intelligence service. &quot;The regional and neighbouring countries that have interactions with Israel should pay attention that any facility they provide to the Zionist regime is considered against the region and the Islamic Republic,&quot; Moslehi warned. In November, bomb attacks in Tehran killed Majid Shahriari, a prominent nuclear scientist, and wounded Fereidoun Abbasi, a nuclear physicist. Iran has also admitted in recent months that its uranium enrichment plant was affected by the Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted the industrial management software that Iran uses to run its centrifuges. All of these incidents have led to speculation last week by the former Israeli intelligence chief Meir Dagan that Iran would be unlikely to build a nuclear bomb before 2015. Some analysts believe that the sophistication of the assassinations and the Stuxnet worm are indications that Israel might be behind the covert campaign. Iran also signalled today that it would negotiate with six world powers over its nuclear programme on 21 and 22 January in Istanbul. Iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful and says that western countries, especially the US and Israel, are trying to prevent it from progressing technologically.

The move has sparked calls from Jewish settler groups and their supporters for a counter-boycott. The lucrative contracts are conditional on the firms agreeing to eschew &quot;products of the territories&quot; in line with the Palestinian Authority&apos;s boycott of goods and services from settlements. The companies have signed agreements with Bayti, a Palestinian-Qatari group building a new city in the West Bank intended to become a hub for the technology industry and house 40,000 people. The \u00a3850m Rawabi project is a sign of the West Bank&apos;s flourishing economy. Israeli politicians and settlement supporters have condemned the contracts. Dozens of members of the Knesset (parliament) have called for the government to boycott Israeli companies that have signed the Rawabi deals, a demand backed by the Knesset&apos;s economics committee. &quot;Anyone building Rawabi should know that they won&apos;t build Tel Aviv,&quot; the rightwing pro-settler Knesset member Aryeh Eldad said. The Land of Israel Lobby, headed by Eldad, said in a statement: &quot;This is shameful and shocking collaboration with Palestinian economic terrorism.&quot; The companies had &quot;sold their Zionist souls for a deal with the enemy&quot;. Bashar Masri, Bayti&apos;s managing director, said the clause was not new, adding: &quot;I have been insisting on this for three years at least. I always put this in as a condition up front. Someone has decided to make an issue of this now. &quot;It&apos;s the norm that we don&apos;t support the aggressor, those who take our land and make our lives miserable.&quot; He said he expected &quot;a whole lot more&quot; Israeli companies to agree to the clause in order to win contracts with Bayti. &quot;None of the people who have already signed have backed out, despite the threats of the radicals,&quot; he said. The Samaria Settlers&apos; Committee this week offered a 500 shekel (\u00a390) reward to anyone disclosing the identity of companies involved. Two companies have been named in the Israeli media. One, Ytong, which makes concrete blocks, denied it had agreed to boycott settlement products. &quot;Ytong is not a partner to this boycott or any other,&quot; the firm said in a statement. Another, Teldor Cables, has a factory in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a report in Israeli daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. The Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, has vigorously promoted a boycott of settlement produce in the West Bank, with shops ordered not to stock such goods. The implementation of a law banning Palestinians from working in settlements has been delayed as alternative employment has not yet been found. An estimated 21,000 Palestinians work in construction, agriculture or industry in Jewish settlements. The boycott movement has attracted support in other countries. Israel accuses its backers of trying to delegitimise the Jewish state. An attempt by Masri to buy land from an Israeli company in East Jerusalem to build housing for Palestinians foundered this week after a campaign to block it. The Jewish settlement of Nof Zion has been in financial difficulty for some time. &quot;It&apos;s in the heart of East Jerusalem, surrounded by thousands of Palestinian homes,&quot; Masri said. &quot;But [the campaigners] wanted to block land going from a Jewish owner to a Palestinian owner.

When the adults finish their performance, the young listeners slide off their chairs, extract a variety of instruments from their cases and take over the stage. Over the next half hour, the room is filled with the sound of pieces by Bach, Scarlatti and Tielman Susato, a 16th-century Flemish composer. This scene might be unexceptional in a comfortable conservatory in Europe or North America, but this is a bare, unheated room in Jalazone, a Palestinian refugee camp near the West Bank town of Ramallah. Here, in a neighbourhood that lacks a basic sewage system and where night military incursions are commonplace, the presence of violins, flutes and cellos feels almost revolutionary. They \u2013 and the young musicians who play them \u2013 are part of the al-Kamandjati camp&apos;s orchestra. &quot;This is fun. I like it when I come here,&quot; says Hala, a nine-year-old girl who is difficult to separate from her flute. Like the other children gathered in the Jalazone youth centre, Hala attends music lessons twice a week. She learns musical theory and practises her instrument. Ibrahim, 14, prefers the guitar. He has been playing the instrument for three years, admitting that &quot;at the beginning it was difficult&quot;. &quot;Here the students not only learn music,&quot; says Iad Jaradat, a field supervisor with al-Kamandjati. &quot;They also learn to have dreams and to express themselves. They learn to listen, to respect the teacher and to appreciate other cultures and other kinds of music.&quot; Ramzi Aburedwan, 31, is the soul of the project, which he founded. Himself a refugee from the al-Amari camp near Ramallah, Aburedwan says: &quot;As a kid, I was deprived of any access to music and I wanted to change that.&quot; Aburedwan was eight years old when he became a poster boy for the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, after being photographed with his hands full of stones, ready to throw them at the Israeli soldiers. But his life changed dramatically. When he was 16 some foreigners organised a music workshop in Ramallah. They did not want the project to be too elitist, so they asked around for a refugee child to make the initiative look more diverse. Someone mentioned a motivated young refugee who worked as a newspaper boy on the streets. That boy was Aburedwan. &quot;When I first saw the viola, I fell in love with the instrument,&quot; he recalls. His career as a musician soon took off, eventually leading him to France. &quot;There I discovered that it was possible to play music in the churches. I realised that even if we had no concert halls in the Palestinian villages, we had a church in almost all of them.&quot; In 2002, Aburedwan started al-Kamandjati, which is today supported by several international donors. The association organises festivals, sends Palestinian children to study music abroad and teaches music to hundreds of children all over the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon. However, the path has been full of obstacles. &quot;The Israelis keep on making it difficult for us,&quot; complains Aburedwan. He says the instruments of three German musicians have been confiscated at Tel Aviv airport. Peter Solski, 44, teaches at al-Kamandjati. He also lectures at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University and started coming to the West Bank 15 years ago. He says: &quot;The talent of the Palestinian children is similar to that of the American pupils. The difference is that the kids here learn faster because they are hungrier and because they have fewer distractions.&quot; Clemency Burton-Hill, a British violinist playing at the annual baroque festival, says teaching in the West Bank &quot;is an incredibly humbling experience&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve seen kids that had to sit for hours in a checkpoint in order to attend one violin lesson,&quot; she says at al-Kamandjati&apos;s offices in Ramallah. A few kilometres away, in Jalazone camp, the children&apos;s concert is over. The young artists have celebrated their musical exploits with glasses of raspberry juice and small pastries filled with cheese. It is time to go home, along the dusty, unlit alleys of the refugee camp, with their instruments proudly clasped in their arms.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-14T17:05:56Z", "title": "Palestinian children's orchestra inspires youngsters at refugee camp", "sentences": ["He says the instruments of three German musicians have been confiscated at Tel Aviv airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/14/palestinian-refugee-camp-children-orchestra"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "On 12 December 2008, Izzeldin Abuelaish, a doctor from Gaza, took his six daughters and two sons on a day out. The family rose early, packed a picnic and, at 7am, climbed into his old Subaru and headed out. Gaza is not big \u2013 just 25 miles long, and nine miles across at its widest \u2013 but the situation being what it is, it can take time to move around and Abuelaish was determined that they make the most of the hours ahead. Twelve weeks earlier, Nadia, his wife of 21 years, had died suddenly of leukaemia and ever since, every day had dawned black. It was his intention, that sunny winter morning, to shine a little light on them, to give his brood some respite, however brief, from their grief. Their first stop was a surprise. Unbeknown to his family, Abuelaish had recently bought a small olive grove, about an acre in size. Separated from the urban sprawl by a 10ft-high fence, it was &quot;a utopia, a little piece of Shangri-La&quot;. The smaller ones, delighted to discover this new place, ran among the olive, fig and apricot trees, before finally settling down to eat their falafel sandwiches beneath a bower of vines. As they did so, the family talked. Abuelaish had been offered a job in Toronto, Canada, and he wanted to know how the children, who had never known anywhere other than Gaza, would feel about this. (Good, as it turned out. &quot;I want to fly, daddy,&quot; said his daughter, Aya.) The family discussion over, they headed to the beach, where the children dashed over the dunes, chased the surf, and wrote their names in the sand. Abuelaish cherished their laughter, the way they mimicked and teased one another. For the first time in many days, his spirits lifted. &quot;We are getting there,&quot; he remembers thinking. &quot;They will be okay. Together, we can do this.&quot; In Gaza, though, a man may take nothing for granted. On 27 December, Israel launched an air strike against the Gaza Strip, a response to the firing of Qassam rockets into Israeli border towns by Hamas. This was followed, on 3 January 2009, by a ground invasion. For the next three weeks, Gaza was a war zone. It was impossible even to leave the house. Was Abuelaish frightened for his family? Of course, he was. &quot;But we were prepared. I filled two small suitcases with precious things: passports, certificates. I told each of the children what would happen in a case of emergency. Because the shelling was everywhere. No one was without risk.&quot; All the same, he refused to consider the possibility that anyone in his family would be hurt. Apart from anything else, they were not involved. No weapons in the Abuelaish basement, no Hamas militia on the roof. &quot;Could we fight the most advanced military in the world? No. We had only our muscles, our blood.&quot; He trusted in God and, though he does not spell it out, in a kind of magical thinking. Don&apos;t think about it, and it will not happen. He also made himself useful. For the duration of the war, the Israeli government allowed no journalists to enter Gaza; they could only gather on the border, and listen to the shelling. But Abuelaish knew plenty of Israelis \u2013 thanks to his work as an infertility specialist, he had worked in several Israeli hospitals \u2013 and among his many friends on the other side was Shlomi Eldar, a reporter for Israel&apos;s Channel 10. Eldar began calling Abuelaish late every afternoon to ask what had happened during the course of the day. Live on air, his friend would then describe the scene \u2013 from the vantage point of his living room window, he could see entire neighbourhoods being obliterated \u2013 for the benefit of viewers of the evening news show. Abuelaish knew that his audience was not likely to be particularly sympathetic to his point of view. Most Israelis believed the Gazans had brought this crisis on themselves. He also knew that there was a chance that someone on his own side would take against his addressing Israel, and that this might involve reprisals against his family, but he kept taking the calls. &quot;With my voice in their ears, the Israelis couldn&apos;t entirely ignore the cost to the Palestinians of their military action.&quot; The next days were dreadful. On 13 January, the air was so full of debris and dust, it was hard to tell day from night. On 14 January, a tank rolled up outside their front door, and only after a hysterical phone call to Shlomi \u2013 who, horrified, called the Israeli defence force to ask if they knew that they were aiming their guns at the house of a doctor with no connections to Hamas \u2013 did it finally move on. Their home was starting to feel crowded. Abuelaish&apos;s second eldest daughter, Dalal, 19, was at her aunt&apos;s house, but his other children \u2013 Bessan, 20, Shatha, 17, Mayar, 15, Aya, 14, Mohammed, 12, Raffah, nine and Abdallah, six \u2013 were all with Abuelaish. So, too, was his brother Shehab and his daughter, Noor. In the apartment below was another brother, Atta, and his family; in the apartment above, his brother Nasser&apos;s family. Between the three apartments, there was much coming and going: there was comfort in crowding together. But supplies of food and water were running low. There was talk of a ceasefire, and Abuelaish tried to reassure his children that it must surely happen soon. Privately, though, he was worried. Rumours of a ceasefire often signal the last violent bombardment of a conflict. Could the worst be yet to come? On 16 January, after a lunch of duck with rice \u2013 Shehab had taken the risk of heading out to the backyard to grab the birds \u2013 and a phone call to Dalal, whom everyone was missing, the family drifted out of the dining room. The girls, meanwhile \u2013 Shatha, Mayar, Aya and their cousin Noor \u2013 went into their bedroom to read and do their homework until it was time for the family again to huddle together on the dining room floor (no one slept in their own beds; they were considered too close to the buildings&apos; outer walls for safety). Nine-year-old Raffah was in the kitchen, with Bessan. Mohammed was in the hall. Abdallah, the baby of the family, was on his father&apos;s shoulders. Abuelaish was trying to distract the boy; the situation \u2013 his family&apos;s imprisonment in their own home \u2013 was incomprehensible to him. Suddenly, there was a monstrous explosion: &quot;a thundering, fulminating sound,&quot; says Abuelaish, that penetrated his body, almost as if it were coming from within him. There was a blinding flash, and then it was pitch dark. Dust everywhere, the struggle to breathe, the sound of a child screaming: these are the things he remembers, and always will. In the next few moments, it dawned on him that a shell had hit his daughters&apos; bedroom. He ran towards it. &quot;I saw everything,&quot; he says. &quot;My children in parts. A decapitated head. And Shatha in front of me, with her eye on her cheek.&quot; The room was now a heaped mess of school books, dolls and body parts. Mayar, Aya, and his niece, Noor, were dead, their limbs strewn about the place as carelessly as their toys. Shatha was bleeding profusely from her hand, one finger hanging by a thread. Then came a second blast. This took Bessan. Ghaida, his brother Atta&apos;s daughter, who had run up the stairs from their apartment towards the noise, lay on the floor, wounds all over her body. Abuelaish looked at all this, and inside him, something stirred. A desire to fight pushed his shock, which should have been so paralysing, out of the way with unexpected force. &quot;I thought: what can I do? And I started moving, fast. I thought of Shatha. I didn&apos;t want her to be blind, to lose her fingers. I didn&apos;t want that. Then I looked at my son. He has lost his sisters. Now what is he going to do? How can I protect him? Is he going to be an extremist, to be crazy, to hate the world?&quot; These thoughts, he insists, are not retrospective. Truly. His brain was working overtime. &quot;I started to think. What can I do for those who are living?&quot; Abuelaish remembered that, though there might be soldiers outside his door, though it would undoubtedly take a long time for an ambulance to push its way through the dangerous, pot-holed streets, he still had a powerful connection to the outside world. He pulled out his phone, and called Shlomi Eldar. Eldar was in a Channel 10 studio in Tel Aviv, sitting behind a desk with another news pundit. He saw Abuelaish&apos;s name come up on the screen of his phone, but he didn&apos;t answer the first call. The show was live, after all. Then, just as an interview with the foreign minister Tzipi Livni was about to begin, his phone flashed again. This time \u2013 to this day, he doesn&apos;t know why \u2013 he answered. Livni could wait. I have since watched what happened next on YouTube at least a dozen times, and all I can tell you is that it never grows any less powerful. Eldar holds his mobile up to the camera, so the audience at home can see it. He also puts it on speakerphone so that the voice on the other end is clearly audible. On the line, a man is weeping. &quot;My God, my God,&quot; he says, over and over. &quot;What have we done? What have we done?&quot; The expression on Eldar&apos;s face is terrible. It is clear that he is struggling not to cry. &quot;Tell me where you are,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;ll send an ambulance to your house.&quot; Abuelaish seems not to hear this. &quot;I wanted to try to save them,&quot; he says. &quot;But they died, Shlomi.&quot; This goes on for several minutes until, finally, Eldar, ashen, tight-lipped, excuses himself, pulls his microphone from his shirt, and exits the studio. &quot;I can&apos;t hang up this conversation,&quot; he says. Outside the studio, on another line, Eldar rang the administrator of the Erez checkpoint. Open the border, he told him. Let the ambulances we&apos;ve called through. The idea was that the Israeli ambulance teams would meet their Palestinian counterparts at the border, so that Shatha, Ghaida and his brother Nasser, who had also been injured, could be transferred to an Israeli hospital (Gazan hospitals are simply not well enough equipped for most emergency work). Meanwhile, someone else had the foresight to dispatch a camera team to the border, too \u2013 which is how, a little while later, television viewers in Israel came to see Abuelaish first kissing a heavily-bandaged Shatha, who is by now on a stretcher, and then directing the paramedics as they put her inside an ambulance. I&apos;ve watched this several times, too. The first action is so tender, the second so determined. Though it seems not to make any sense at all, amid the chaos and the flash of camera lights, you already glimpse in Abuelaish the qualities on which, in the coming days, people were to remark admiringly, and with some amazement, again and again: his calmness, his stoicism and, above all, his dignity.     Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish, with his son Abdallah, 6, feels the strain in the aftermath of the Israeli air strikes against the Gaza Strip.  Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP Photo    In Toronto, it is far too many degrees below freezing for anyone&apos;s comfort and when I arrive at his suburban house, Abuelaish is, somewhat inexpertly, shovelling snow. &quot;You don&apos;t get this in Gaza,&quot; he says, with a smile. The job done \u2013 well, sort of \u2013 we go inside. &quot;Welcome,&quot; he murmurs, extending an arm. &quot;Welcome.&quot; The house smells faintly of za&apos;atar, the thyme and sumac mixture Palestinians claim as their national dish and, on a side-table, stands a model of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. But otherwise, this could be the house of just about any Canadian family: flat-screen television, computer, gleaming fitted kitchen. From upstairs comes the reassuring sound of children bickering. Everything is very normal, and very safe: about as far away from Gaza as it is possible to be. Abuelaish is now a professor in global health at the University of Toronto. What does it feel like to be here? Another beaming smile. &quot;It&apos;s not such a change,&quot; he says. &quot;We just think: why can&apos;t it be like this in Gaza? Why not? I hope that when we go back to Gaza, this is the feeling the children will take with them.&quot; So they will return? &quot;Of course, eventually.&quot; Is the family homesick? &quot;Yes. We are so far from our beloved ones, from the graves: my mother, my wife, my daughters. But we are also great! The children are great! Talk to them, you&apos;ll see.&quot; His daughter Raffah appears. She is very pretty. &quot;I&apos;m the second youngest,&quot; she says. Her father gazes at her adoringly. &quot;It&apos;s true what people say,&quot; he murmurs. And what do people say? &quot;That time is a great healer. And faith helps. It&apos;s a great asset; it&apos;s a blessing from God, and it helps you.&quot; Right from the start, he tells me, it was his children that reminded him of this. &quot;When I called my friend [Shlomi Eldar] and I was screaming, my son Mohammed said to me: &apos;Why are you crying? You must be happy.&apos; &apos;Happy for what?&apos; I asked. &apos;Because my sisters are with their mum,&apos; he told me. It came as a message: this 12-year-old boy telling me to move forward. I was saved, and now it was my job to save others. I could have been killed, too, so very easily, and then no one would have known our story.&quot; This is his mission: to tell his family&apos;s story and, in doing so, prove to the world that not every Palestinian is motivated only by revenge \u2013 and he embarked on it right away, as soon as Shatha was out of surgery. The morning after he and Shatha arrived at the hospital, Zeev Rotstein, the director of the Sheba Medical Centre, a hospital where Abuelaish had once taught, organised a press conference, and asked him to speak. Abuelaish told the journalists that, inside the hospital, all were equal. Why, he asked, could this not also be the case outside? About halfway through, however, he was interrupted, in full view of the television cameras, by a screaming woman, her face contorted with rage: Levana Stern, an Israeli mother of three soldiers. She blamed the victim. &quot;Who knows what you had in your house?&quot; she shouted. &quot;No one is saying anything about that.&quot; Abuelaish, pale now, put his head in his hands. &quot;They don&apos;t want to know the truth,&quot; he said. This is the only time most people have ever seen him look anything like close to defeated. It must have been a horrifying moment. But, amazingly, it didn&apos;t change anything. &quot;Actually, it was good,&quot; he says to me, now. &quot;She was one Israeli, only one. Others started to open their eyes. Hundreds of people from all over the Holy Land, people I didn&apos;t know, sent messages to me. They were awakened. And that&apos;s when I understood: this tragedy will do some good.&quot; Hours later, Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, announced a unilateral ceasefire. &quot;So, we saved lives. I told the children: your sisters&apos; blood wasn&apos;t wasted. We sacrificed them for others. There was a reason.&quot; Encouraged, he determined to keep going. During the two years since the shelling of his home, he has travelled the world, always giving, in essence, the same speech: I refuse to hate, he tells his distinguished audiences, and I do not believe in revenge; hatred is an illness, and the enemy of peace. His stance has won him humanitarian awards around the world, and a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it has also, appallingly, led to claims that he is cashing in on his loss, a point of view to which I can only say: weren&apos;t there people who said the same about Otto Frank? So far, the Israeli government has neither compensated Abuelaish, nor apologised to him. &quot;Actually, for me, it&apos;s not a question of compensation,&quot; he says. &quot;But an apology? Yes. That would be good. The truth is the shortest way in life. It&apos;s not shameful to apologise. If I did something wrong to you, and I said sorry, I would be highly valued by you, and in the eyes of others. I wish they would have the moral courage.&quot; He has been told that there exists a statute of limitations on the issue of compensation and apology of two years. Two years! &quot;There is no statute of limitation for our loved ones. It&apos;s insane. For me, it&apos;s now. It&apos;s now, and it will always be now. It will never leave me, so long as I am breathing.&quot; He sees his daughters in waking dreams: they move, they smile. They live with him still, spiritually. &quot;Believe me, even as I speak to you, I see them.&quot; Though he makes no sound, he has begun to weep: huge tears, that he makes no effort to wipe away. The pity of it is, he could not even bury his daughters. The Qur&apos;an says that the dead must be buried quickly, and getting a permit to travel back into Gaza from Israel, where he was still watching over Shatha, Ghaida and his brother, would have taken too long. Nor were Bessan, Mayar and Aya permitted to be buried beside their mother; the family was told by Israeli soldiers that, at the present time, no one was allowed into the Jabalia camp cemetery. Did the doctors save Shatha&apos;s eye? &quot;Yes, but not its sight.&quot; And her hand? &quot;She is able to use it, but with some difficulty.&quot; Where is she now? He smiles. &quot;She&apos;s upstairs, studying,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted her to talk to you, but she apologises: she did not know you were coming, and so she is not ready to show herself.&quot; A pause. He is grinning, now. &quot;She is a very good student, believe me. Just a few weeks after the attack, you know, she got 95% in her final high-school grades. Now she&apos;s studying computer engineering at the University of Toronto. She&apos;s amazing.&quot; This is true. But my hunch is that she is also a chip off the old block. Izzeldin Abuelaish&apos;s childhood was, as he puts it in his new book, spent &quot;in the shadow of a promise&quot;. We&apos;ll go back soon, said his parents. Maybe in two weeks, maybe a little longer. The Abuelaish family is from Houg, a village near Sderot, the Israeli border town now so mercilessly plagued by Qassam rockets. The family was a large and prominent one, and Abuelaish&apos;s grandfather, Moustafa, was the village head. In 1948, however, when the State of Israel was created, Moustafa decided that it would be wise for the family to leave; he had heard rumours of attacks on Arabs elsewhere and, though he didn&apos;t know if these stories were true, he decided to run. Gaza, a designated safe area, was not far from Houg, so that was where they went. Today, the Abuelaish family farm is owned by Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli general and prime minister, who now lies in a coma in an Israeli hospital. At the Jabalia refugee camp, where Abuelaish was born in 1955, life was hard. Until he was 10, the family, which eventually numbered 11, lived in a single room only 10ft square. Water was delivered by the United Nations; the children were usually barefoot, flea-bitten and hungry. When Abuelaish was five, one of his newborn siblings \u2013 there always seemed to be a newborn \u2013 was killed in a terrible accident. His brother Nasser had been messing around and, trying to escape his mother&apos;s slap, had accidentally jumped into the dish bucket which doubled as a cradle at night, crushing his tiny sister. The child was buried the next day, and no one ever mentioned it again. As the eldest son, Abuelaish was expected to contribute to the family&apos;s meagre finances as soon as he was capable, and by the time he was 12, he had no choice but to combine school with part-time work. He sold milk rations to other desperate families, and he loaded fertiliser on to farm trucks, rising at four o&apos;clock every morning to start. Life was a grind, punctuated by more misery: in 1967, came the six-day war, after which Israel assumed full control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; when Abuelaish was 15, his family home was unaccountably bulldozed under orders from Ariel Sharon. There were, he writes, two ways young men could respond to all this. Some became political. Abuelaish&apos;s brother, Noor, joined Fatah, Palestine&apos;s biggest political party, and went on to do a stint inside an Israeli prison (after his release, he went to Lebanon; the family has not heard from him since 1983). Others invested everything they had in education. This was what Abuelaish chose. He worked, and worked, and he was rewarded: a scholarship to study medicine in Cairo; a postgraduate qualification in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of London; and a masters degree in public health at Harvard. Right from the beginning, he was determined never to generalise when it came to Israel. It was easy to despise an individual: a particularly difficult soldier at the border; the Jewish mother who accused him \u2013 a highly qualified Arab doctor \u2013 of trying to murder her baby. Ditto the policies that made life in Gaza so difficult. But it was not acceptable, he felt and still feels, to allow these feelings to transmute into hatred for an entire people. Besides, he had so many Israeli friends. As a teenager, he had worked on an Israeli moshav, where he was never treated with anything other than kindness by its owners. As a doctor, he had been employed by several Israeli hospitals, helping Israeli women with fertility problems. At the time of the shelling of his home in 2008, he was working full-time at the Gertner Institute, a renowned centre for the study of health policy and epidemiology in Tel Hashomer, near Ramat Gan. During the long \u2013 they sometimes felt endless! \u2013 journeys between Gaza and Israel, he learned, not hatred, but a patience and a humility that have seen him through a great deal. Impossible to get ideas above your station when you spend as much time as any taxi driver, farmer or waiter standing at the border checkpoints. On one occasion, Abuelaish arrived at the Israeli hospital where he was working, only to find that he had left his briefcase behind accidentally at the crossing. By the time he had driven the 27 miles back, it had been blown up by the soldiers. It took him two months to replace the documents \u2013 those all important travel permits \u2013 that had been destroyed. Tell him that you wish more people were able to be so clear-sighted, though, and he will only admonish you. &quot;I am not exceptional,&quot; he says. &quot;You think the same, don&apos;t you?&quot; But it&apos;s easy for me, I say; I don&apos;t live in Gaza or, for that matter, in Sderot. &quot;Well, in the case of the Palestinians, we need to make them ready to listen. You didn&apos;t do this interview out in the street in the cold, or in the middle of the night. You came with your tape recorder, and you were prepared, and you listened. It&apos;s the same with Gaza. People are hungry, and sick. If we made sure they were not hungry, or sick, they would be in a position to listen. Who can help them? The Israeli side. Their sickness, their hunger, affects the Israelis. Return my life to me, and I will show you how much I appreciate that life.&quot; Nevertheless, I am in awe of his extraordinary optimism. Even from the safety of my sofa at home in London, I can&apos;t feel optimistic about the situation in Israel/Palestine. &quot;But that&apos;s not true,&quot; he says. &quot;Why did you come to see me? Because you feel optimistic about this interview. And that&apos;s great! This small spark of hope\u2026 maybe we can turn it into a big fire.&quot; There is talk of another war in the region right now; the borders are more tense than they have been for many months. Does this worry him? &quot;I think that nothing is impossible. But I also think there are alternatives. If this situation was a patient of mine, I would not necessarily be suggesting surgery.&quot; His main anxiety, he says, is the refusal of the Israeli government to stop building settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. &quot;It&apos;s such a small thing: just to freeze it for a few months. The world is begging them! But if we can&apos;t even make this happen\u2026&quot; What does peace look like? &quot;I can say only that there will never be peace when it works only for one side, and that maybe peace cannot be imposed but must come by choice. It looks to me as though Palestinians and Israelis are sailing in the same boat, and what&apos;s dangerous for one is dangerous for the other. They are like conjoined twins! We need a two-state solution which gives security and dignity to both.&quot; Meanwhile, in Canada, his work goes on. Abuelaish has established a charitable foundation, Daughters for Life, which he hopes will support the education of girls. &quot;Because I am determined that my daughters&apos; names will not only be written on their gravestones, but on the doors of institutions, and other good places.&quot; The week after we meet will be the second anniversary of their deaths. For the first anniversary, he returned to his house in Gaza, now finally rebuilt. He needed to be there. But this year, he will stay at home in Canada. &quot;We will sit together as a family, and we will talk about them, and pray for them, and look at photographs. Those precious, lovely souls. They were combatants for humanity, and for peace, and their loss was unjust. But we will remember them with holy deeds and noble words, and we will keep their memory alive until we see them again. As long as I am living, they will speak to me, and to others.&quot; For a moment, he closes his eyes. &quot;For as long as I am breathing, they are breathing with me.&quot; The silence that follows is broken only by the sound of Raffah. The cartoon she is watching has made her laugh, and like wildfire, it spreads: first to me, and then to her father. This is the saddest story I have ever had to write, but it is not only that. It is also a story of hope and, as Izzeldin Abuelaish has already told me more than once, we are none of us anything without that.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-16T00:05:32Z", "title": "Gaza doctor Izzeldin Abuelaish | interview", "sentences": ["Eldar was in a Channel 10 studio in Tel Aviv, sitting behind a desk with another news pundit."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/16/gaza-doctor-izzeldin-abuelaish-interview"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "UK news", "Susannah York"], "article": " Susannah York, the British actress whose gamine looks and demure persona made her an icon of the swinging 60s, has died at the age of 72. She passed away yesterday following a long battle with bone marrow\u00a0cancer. York won acclaim for her roles in They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They? \u2013 the 1969 film role for which she was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe \u2013 as well as A Man For All Seasons in 1966 and as the feisty section officer who took on Kenneth More in the stirring second world war epic Battle of Britain in 1969. She also had an extensive and critically acclaimed stage career, which included roles in The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs and Henry James&apos;s play Appearances, and continued to act late into her life. She was also a children&apos;s author, penning two fantasy novels. Her son, actor Orlando Wells, yesterday described her as &quot;an absolutely fantastic mother, who was very down to earth&quot;. &quot;She loved nothing more than cooking a good Sunday roast and sitting around a fire of a winter&apos;s evening. In some senses, she was quite a home girl. Both Sasha [his sister] and I feel incredibly lucky to have her as a mother,&quot; he said. Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard also played tribute to York, recalling his first meeting at the dawn of the 1960s with a woman who was to win a legion of male admirers. &quot;I remember back in 1961, when I was a young journalist, I interviewed her for a magazine for her film The Greengage Summer, and I still remember how completely charmed I was. &quot;She was so pleasant to me \u2013 she even let me interview her at home as long as I promised not to write that, because journalists weren&apos;t normally allowed to go to her home. I still think of her with great\u00a0affection.&quot; Born Susannah Yolande Fletcher in London in January 1939, her father was a merchant banker and her mother the daughter of a diplomat. Her parents divorced when she was five and after her mother remarried a Scottish businessman the family moved to Scotland. After training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she won the Ronson award for most promising student, York began her film career in 1960 when she appeared in Tunes of Glory, co-starring with Alec Guinness and John Mills. In the same year she met and married Michael Wells, with whom she had two children, before they divorced in 1976. The 1960s proved to be a golden period for her, during which she was to become one of the decade&apos;s most memorable faces. A string of successes culminated in her best-known role, starring with Jane Fonda in the Sydney Pollack-directed They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They?, for which she won a Bafta and an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Critics also praised her performance as Childie, the young lesbian in Robert Aldrich&apos;s film adaptation of Frank Marcus&apos;s hit play The Killing of Sister George (1968), a role that was said to have demonstrated her versatility. Acclaim for her work continued into the 1970s, when she went on to appear with Glenda Jackson in The Maids (1975), and in Zee and Co (1972). Her stage career underwent a particular rejuvenation in the 1990s when she played Gertrude and Mistress Ford in the RSC&apos;s productions of Hamlet and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Outside of the world of drama, York was also politically active and supported causes ranging from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament to the campaign to free Mordechai Vanunu, who was imprisoned after blowing the whistle on Israel&apos;s nuclear arms programme. York showed the rebellious streak that was a feature of her life when, performing The Loves of Shakespeare&apos;s Women in Tel Aviv in 2007, she dedicated the performance to Vanunu. However, she spoke of the utmost importance of family to her life in a 2008 interview. &quot;Seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend.

Under the banner of the &quot;Democratic Camp&quot;, a coalition of organisations and prominent individuals, the marchers heard speakers lambast the Israeli government, singling out the rightwing foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who is seen as threatening Israel&apos;s democracy. But there was also strong criticism of the Labour party for being a partner in Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s coalition government. Labour had allowed &quot;the existence of the most racist coalition in the history of Israel&quot;, Nitzan Horowitz, a member of the Knesset for the leftwing Meretz party, told the crowd. &quot;No member of the Labour party can claim to have clean hands. You are members of the most extreme government \u2026 For what have you betrayed your principles? For a few ministers&apos; chairs?&quot; The organisers of the march and rally hoped it would signal the beginning of the revival of Israel&apos;s left and a fightback against the dominance of the right. Around 20,000 people attended the rally according to the organisers; the police said there were 10,000 present. The galvanising issue was the recent approval by the Knesset of a bill to set up a parliamentary investigation into the funding of civil and human rights groups. It has been seen by opponents across the political spectrum as a fundamental attack on democracy and reminiscent of a McCarthyite witch-hunt. Following the vote, the opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, said an evil wind was blowing across Israel. Some in the crowd on Saturday evening held placards saying &quot;Investigate me too&quot;. Speakers at the rally cited other recent moves including a call by rabbis to ban Jews from selling or renting property to Arabs, a parliamentary vote in favour of a &quot;loyalty oath&quot; to be taken by new Israeli citizens, and the jailing of the activist Jonathan Pollack after taking part in a bicycle protest. Addressing the rally, Meir Sheetrit of the centre-right Kadima party said legislation to investigate rights groups would be &quot;taking a brick out of the wall of democracy&quot;. Avraham Burg, a former Knesset speaker and a driving force behind the embryonic Democratic Camp, told the Guardian the situation was &quot;an emergency&quot;. &quot;Israel is not a democracy any more. Technically it is, but the foundations of democracy \u2013 liberty, equality \u2013 are under threat. The rabbinical fatwas and political harassment are red lights.

This is the launching pad for the future political generation of Israel&quot;. Protesters held placards reading &quot;Jews and Arabs will not be enemies&quot; and &quot;We will fight the regime of darkness&quot;, and both Israeli and Palestinian flags were waved.

While the West Ham United manager waits to be put out of his misery at Upton Park, his reluctance to name the senior club executives he claims have it in for him could ensure he gets his four-year contract paid up in full \u2013 thought to be worth at least \u00a35m. Perhaps his refusal to speak out against the owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, or the vice\u2011chairman, Karren Brady, derives from studying the fate of his immediate predecessor, Gianfranco Zola. Despite avoiding relegation the Italian was sacked at the close of last season for &quot;breach of contract&quot;, the owners citing an apparently innocuous response from Zola to Sullivan&apos;s declaration that every player but Scott Parker was for sale. This followed a long and attritional campaign of public criticism of the team from Sullivan and Gold. Grant did not emerge for his usual chat after goals from Arsenal&apos;s Robin van Persie (twice) and Theo Walcott handed his side an 11th league defeat of a troubled season. The message was that the Israeli was reluctant to field yet more questions regarding his future, having woken on Saturday morning to media reports that claimed he would lose his job whatever the result at home against Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s team. Yet Grant might have decided to pass up the first chance to offer his views regarding his treatment by Sullivan, Gold and Brady. How long Grant remains piloting West Ham is moot as Martin O&apos;Neill was last night locked in talks about whether to succeed him. The former Aston Villa manager was first sounded out by a West Ham executive last week. The sack is apparently inevitable for Grant and it could be a shrewd move to keep his own counsel to avoid giving any reason why he should not receive every penny he is due. The 55-year-old former Chelsea, Portsmouth, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa and Israel head coach did not accrue nearly four decades&apos; experience in an often treacherous industry without learning a few lessons. Zola&apos;s tenure as manager ended when, despite retaining West Ham&apos;s Premier League status, Gold and Sullivan marched him out in May, framing his removal as a disciplinary matter. Following a 3-1 home defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in late March, Sullivan had published an open letter on the club&apos;s website that described the side as &quot;shambolic&quot;, among other things. An exasperated Zola responded to this by asking: &quot;What the hell is going on? Jesus Christ.&quot; When in late April Sullivan declared the fire sale of virtually all the club&apos;s players, Zola&apos;s reply was: &quot;If I was Mark Noble or Robert Green or Valon Behrami, I wouldn&apos;t be very pleased to hear that I was for sale. What can I say to that?&quot; That prompted his dismissal by Sullivan and Gold in hope that they might avoid paying Zola \u00a31.9m in compensation. The case was settled in June and it is understood that Zola, with the backing of the League Managers Association, received all he was demanding. &quot;I prefer to talk about football rather than answer questions about other things around, especially when I am not the man you need to be asking,&quot; Grant said on Saturday. &quot;I had two choices and chose to focus on the football. Rumours on the day of a game do not help. It does not matter where the rumours came from. I still want to focus on the thing I can control and this is the team. &quot;[Around] other teams there is a lot of quiet, so that has helped [them] but I think we have dealt with it all very well. If we do the right thing, there will be a bright future here and not just in the cup.&quot; West Ham take a 2-1 lead into the Carling Cup semi-final with Birmingham City next week. The chances of Grant being in charge appear remote. But, if O&apos;Neill declines the job and Sullivan, Gold and Brady continue their reluctance to sack Grant, this impasse could run and run.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-17T07:01:03Z", "title": "Avram Grant's silence could be worth \u00a35m in West Ham payoff battle", "sentences": ["The 55-year-old former Chelsea, Portsmouth, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa and Israel head coach did not accrue nearly four decades&apos; experience in an often treacherous industry without learning a few lessons."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/17/avram-grant-west-ham-united-arsenal"}, {"tags": ["Linda Grant", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"], "article": "Linda Grant believes she is one of the most fortunate human beings ever to have lived, and her new novel, We Had It So Good, sets out to distil the essence of her gilded generation, the transatlantic baby boomers, nurtured from birth on postwar optimism and the belief they could and would remake the world. &quot;It&apos;s time for us to take a long, hard look at ourselves, I think that&apos;s what it&apos;s about, I think the jury is out on my generation,&quot; she says in the first-floor sitting-room of her north London house, where she lives on her own. A mural on one wall depicts the Bay of Naples, with a paperback copy of her first novel, The Cast Iron Shore, perched on the trompe l&apos;oeil balustrades. Grant explains how the design was a cost-based compromise with a friend who makes his living painting murals for the Sultan of Brunei. Grant has friends who started off in bedsits and now own multimillion pound homes in Islington, just like Stephen (BBC producer) and Andrea (psychotherapist) in her new book. &quot;They are typical of a metropolitan elite that votes Labour, that was against the Iraq war, I&apos;m certain they would have voted Lib Dem last time. They are people I could very easily imagine knowing; I love them very much,&quot; she says. But just because her own life choices have not paid off quite so handsomely \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m not going to be like one of these people with their final salary pension schemes&quot; \u2013 does not mean Grant missed out. &quot;It&apos;s partly to do with my age,&quot; she explains. &quot;I&apos;m 59. It&apos;s really difficult to think of any bad thing which has happened to me which is the result of external forces, the forces of history I mean, not the things that could happen to you at any time \u2013 illness, bad relationships, that kind of thing. I don&apos;t believe I have been adversely affected in any way by the forces of history. Perhaps the death of the book will be the thing . . . &quot; Then again, last summer her agent told her she got her career as a novelist going just in time. &quot;I&apos;d be happy if I could manage to keep this going for another five or 10 years, to be absolutely honest,&quot; she says. Grant&apos;s highly praised first novel, The Cast Iron Shore, which drew an ambitious arc across the 20th century and from Liverpool to the north-western US, came out 15 years ago, when she was 45. Since then she has published regularly: When I Lived in Modern Times, her second novel, won the Orange prize for its passionate portrayal of life in the new land of Israel. It was followed by Still Here, which took her back to Liverpool for a middle-aged romance. In The Clothes on Their Backs she moved the action to a small flat in central London, where Vivien grows up the only daughter of ultra-cautious Jewish parents, and discovers new, thrilling and finally tragic possibilities through her slum-landlord uncle. Some of the characters and ideas in the new novel will be familiar to Grant&apos;s readers. Stephen&apos;s father Simon is an east European Jew with a tale to tell. His job is looking after the furs of Hollywood royalty in a cold storage facility, fur \u2013 along with other luxurious and designer clothing \u2013 being a firm Grant favourite. But We Had It So Good stands apart from Grant&apos;s previous novels, mainly because unlike them it is not written in the voice of a Jewish or part-Jewish first-person narrator. Instead she adopts the third person and, for the first time, concentrates mainly on a male character. Although Stephen&apos;s father is Jewish, as is brought home to him violently after 9/11 when he becomes addicted to scouring the internet for extremist material (&quot;What was it about the Jews, Stephen wondered, hunched over his computer, that seemed to drive everybody else completely crazy?&quot;), his wife Andrea is not. Nor is her friend Grace, and the social milieu in which the novel is set is a metropolitan London one of private schools and dinner parties \u2013 one or two, the namedropper Stephen informs us, with Tony and Cherie Blair. Linda Grant was born in Liverpool, the first child of Benny Ginsberg and Rose Haft (the couple changed the family name to Grant in the early 1950s). Both her parents hailed from large clans of immigrants: her mother&apos;s family were from Kiev, her father&apos;s from Russian-occupied Poland. Despite numerous uncles and aunts nearby, the family tree grew in unstable ground. In the memoir she wrote about her mother&apos;s dementia, Remind Me Who I Am, Again, Grant describes how information withheld for decades suddenly began to emerge as Rose&apos;s illness short-circuited the barriers she had kept up all her life. Antisemitism loomed large in their stories about the past, and neither of her parents ever shook off what Grant describes as a paranoid, insular mindset. When her sister cleared out their mother&apos;s flat and discovered a vile anonymous letter sent when her father applied for naturalisation as a British citizen in 1948, documentary evidence of something they were right to be afraid of came almost as a relief \u2013 &quot;irrefutable proof of something, at last&quot;, Grant wrote. Grant&apos;s aspirational, snobbish mother tended to airbrush out of the picture her own impoverished start \u2013 her father was a cobbler who repaired and sold the shoes of the newly dead \u2013 preferring to ally herself with her grander, suburban in-laws. Grant&apos;s father, a small businessman, manufactured and sold hairdressing products. But neither set of relatives was good enough for Linda, who was sent aged seven to a girls&apos; private school in order to equip herself for marriage to a Jewish solicitor, but ended up becoming something else. &quot;I was embarrassed by my parents,&quot; she says. &quot;I thought they had nothing of interest to say or contribute to anything. My real crime was not understanding that they were interesting, and I have been trying to make it up to them for being so indescribably blas\u00e9, so genuinely uninterested and dismissive.&quot; Grant was 16 in 1967 and describes the year of Sgt Pepper as a watershed. Her parents knew Brian Epstein&apos;s parents and girls in the sixth form knew the Beatles (or said they did), and she would go to the Cavern at lunchtimes and to pubs after O-level revision to listen to the Liverpool poets. It was the year too of her first trip to Israel, where she spent two dreadful months on a kibbutz, and &quot;all these things came together very intensely, causing this total rupture between me and my parents, an absolute definitive rupture, so there wasn&apos;t any negotiation. I was going to go my own way.&quot; She rejected religion, and the &quot;densely Jewish&quot; atmosphere and &quot;very Jewish food regime&quot; of her parents&apos; household, in which Marmite, honey and marmalade were treated as alien substances. After A-levels she spent a year working for Oxfam and hanging out with students in Oxford, then went to York to study English. Then she went abroad, to the US and Canada. For a long time, she hardly looked back. But like Stephen, the flawed hero of her new novel, who makes the same journey in reverse, travelling from California to his Rhodes scholarship in Oxford on a cruise ship with a young Bill Clinton, Grant sees herself as having been tracked down by her past. Her father died when she was 32 and around the same time she began thinking differently about the attitudes that shaped her. Partly this came out of her difficulties in writing. Though she had assumed from childhood that she would one day be a novelist, for years she could not find a voice. &quot;I wasn&apos;t part of any kind of Jewish world. Being from Liverpool was really important but I wasn&apos;t working class and the whole Liverpool identity was a working-class identity. If I tried to write in a neutral English voice it didn&apos;t feel like me at all, I felt completely alienated. I didn&apos;t really know what to do.&quot; Instead she made her living as a journalist on the Guardian. She says now she &quot;hated every single second&quot; writing her weekly column; &quot;I\u00a0would cringe when I saw it.&quot; But she loved being sent abroad to research features and interview people whose stories stay with her and still find their way into her fiction. It was with one such piece of reportage, rejected by newspapers as unsuitable, that she finally made the leap into fiction, adding a character to the Vietnamese street scene she had created and thereby turning it into a section of her\u00a0first novel. Grant has continued to write and to publish non-fiction, doing fashion journalism to boost her income and bringing out collections of essays on two of her favourite subjects: clothes and Israel. She takes the former seriously, a discipline learned from her fashion-conscious mother and, one can&apos;t help but feel, kept up in her honour. The effect can be over the top. In The Thoughtful Dresser she writes of feeling &quot;in love&quot; with items of clothing, describing herself at one point as &quot;close to divinity&quot; in an Armani coat (though this is a joke). But not everyone admires her taste: an acerbic review by\u00a0Lynn Barber criticised the book for\u00a0linking fashion to the Holocaust. Her writing about the Middle East has proved more controversial, and she has locked horns in the past with critics of Israel, for example attacking plans for a cultural boycott. It is only by taking in something of her belated identification with her parents&apos; lost world that it is possible to make sense of the joy with which she greeted her own discovery of Israel in the 1990s. Her infatuation was obvious \u2013 Tel Aviv, she wrote, &quot;was warm when I arrived, the sun as sweet as honey when I woke in the mornings and lay in bed, and felt flooded with the same warm happiness.&quot; When she talks about Israel, her pride and pleasure at being able to refer to conversations with the likes of David Grossman and Aharon Appelfeld are obvious. She thinks now her forays into writing about the politics of the region were unwise. &quot;I usually got it wrong, or was foolish, or whatever,&quot; she says. &quot;I\u00a0really am not a political analyst.&quot; But she says her views have never changed: &quot;it was always two-state solution, back to the 1967 borders, division of Jerusalem, I mean all blindingly obvious, completely standard stuff&quot;. Her problem, she believes, was her timing. &quot;As most other writers were becoming interested in the Palestinian story, I was with horrible timing becoming really interested in the Israeli story. Most people had passed through that 20 or 30 years earlier, I started to get interested at the time of maximum uncoolness. Do I regret that? It certainly didn&apos;t make my life any easier.&quot; Her original plan for the new novel was that one of the main characters would be badly injured in the 7/7 bombings. When a friend&apos;s son was paralysed in the Mumbai attacks she changed tack, wary of exploiting what she knew from real life. But despite this fraught subject matter, and the whole backstory of Stephen and his friends, Oxford rebels who took drugs and lived in a grotty squat, Grant says she &quot;wasn&apos;t remotely interested in having any message, the postwar Labour politics are very much what I subscribe to, I sort of think that&apos;s taken as read&quot;. When I suggest that the new novel&apos;s portrait of the baby boomers is a deeply pessimistic one, that its depiction of inevitable failure and compromise seems to rubbish the progressive aspirations of a generation, to suggest that the grand 60s ideals were little more than hot air, the vanity project of some rather vain and silly students, Grant is having none of it. &quot;I tend to be more optimistic than pessimistic myself,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s about my generation&apos;s arrogance, that&apos;s what it&apos;s about. It became obvious to me that the generation who changed the world were my parents&apos; generation, and not only in terms of the second world war, but if you look at all the social legislation of the 60s \u2013 abortion, homosexual law reform, equal pay \u2013 it wasn&apos;t done by my generation, it was done by people who were adults. We were the beneficiaries.&quot; Again, the key is her parents. &quot;For me what&apos;s most important is this sense that we don&apos;t know our parents, we don&apos;t understand our parents, we don&apos;t believe in our parents. It really is a novel rooted in character.&quot; Out of the ideas swirling around university campuses circa 1970 (&quot;it was so crackers, it really was&quot;), the only one Grant saves from the scrapheap is feminism. A clever, popular girl in the year above her at school left to have a baby, and her downfall made a lasting impression. Birth control, Grant says, changed everything, particularly for women like her who knew they wanted to have sex but not children. Her first book was about the sexual revolution, and she describes the pill as &quot;part of my great luck&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m a daydreamer,&quot; she says. &quot;I was an only child until I was eight and I just used to spend all my time lying on the bed reading, in another world, and I feel like I&apos;m the same person now. I&apos;m not shy, not reclusive, not any of those things, but the idea of a day in front of me when I have nothing to do, is just, oh what pleasure!&quot; She works at her living room table for a couple of hours each morning, and then lies on the sofa. &quot;I start as soon as possible after I wake up because that&apos;s when you&apos;re as close as possible to the dream state, to the unconscious, and I really like my unconscious. I&apos;m a really hectic dreamer, I never wake up not out of a dream and there&apos;s loads going on, lots of action, big blockbuster dreams, they&apos;re all major enterprises.&quot; And if she finds these dreams more preoccupying than the dreams of political change, social justice and environmental action still cherished by some of her contemporaries, and more rewarding too than the wealth enjoyed by others of her class and generation, Grant is making no apology about it. Fittingly enough, as she has devoted her life to it, Grant seems to have more faith in art than in politics. Marianne, Stephen and Andrea&apos;s daughter and in some ways the new book&apos;s most appealing character, is a photographer, first of war and later of dogs, while Grace, definitely its least appealing personality, is briefly a gardener in what Grant says is her favourite chapter. &quot;When she&apos;s chasing after the revolution, you know, she&apos;s doing something that isn&apos;t real,&quot; she says. &quot;But when she describes helping those people make the temporary gardens in New York, that to me is far more real than all the nonsense of the politics. That&apos;s when she&apos;s closest to something that I find much more moving, this idea that somebody would fly in the face of nature and make a garden out of something that isn&apos;t going to survive. That is much closer to the core of the politics of the book, though not stated explicitly. Sometimes the things which are most significant to other people are the things which are transitory, which have no lasting effect, and which aren&apos;t actually meant to change the world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-01-17T08:00:01Z", "title": "Linda Grant: a life in writing", "sentences": ["Her infatuation was obvious \u2013 Tel Aviv, she wrote, &quot;was warm when I arrived, the sun as sweet as honey when I woke in the mornings and lay in bed, and felt flooded with the same warm happiness.&quot; When she talks about Israel, her pride and pleasure at being able to refer to conversations with the likes of David Grossman and Aharon Appelfeld are obvious."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/17/linda-grant-interview-life-writing"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Middle East peace talks", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, claimed today that his coalition government had been strengthened after a day of political upheaval in which Ehud Barak quit the Labour party to form a new faction and three Labour ministers resigned from the cabinet. Barak, defence minister and Labour leader, acted after weeks of pressure from party colleagues over his continued support for Netanyahu&apos;s rightwing government. Four other Labour members of the Knesset (parliament) joined Barak&apos;s faction, called Atzmaut, or Independence, which will remain in the coalition. Their departure leaves eight Labour MKs, who will now be outside the coalition. Despite the realignment, Netanyahu&apos;s government will still command a small parliamentary majority, 66 seats out of 120. But he will be even more reliant on the far right without Labour&apos;s support. &quot;The government has grown much stronger today, in its governance, in its stability \u2013 and this is important for Israel,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;The whole world knows, and the Palestinians know, that this government will be around for the next few years and that it is with this government that they should negotiate for peace.&quot; Barak said Atzmaut will be &quot;centrist, Zionist and democratic&quot;. He told reporters that he had reached the conclusion that a situation &quot;where there were in essence two Labour factions had to stop&quot;. Senior ministers had called on Barak, a former prime minister, to instigate Labour&apos;s withdrawal in protest at the collapse of Middle East peace negotiations. He was castigated during a large pro-democracy rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday. Isaac Herzog, one of the Labour ministers who quit, is expected to stand for the party leadership. He welcomed Barak&apos;s move, saying it would pave the way for &quot;a renewal of the party and its return to social action and true vision&quot;. He added: &quot;The time has come to stop lying to ourselves and leave the government which has brought us to a dead end and forced upon us Avigdor Lieberman and his party with its unacceptable\u00a0racist discourse which threatens our democracy.&quot; Lieberman is foreign minister and\u00a0leader of the rightwing Yisrael Beiteinu party. Avishay Braverman, another departing minister and likely Labour leadership contender, said: &quot;The crisis gives us a chance to rebuild a strong movement. The Labour movement is on a new path.&quot; The third minister to quit, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said he believed the party would now return to its former glory. At the last elections, almost two years ago, Labour \u2013 once considered the natural party of government \u2013 won only 13 seats.

All of them were breaking the law. The party consisted of around 20 mostly middle-aged Israeli women, slightly fewer and younger Palestinian women and a handful of the latter&apos;s children. The Palestinians were from villages in the West Bank and therefore forbidden entry into Israel without proper permits. The Israeli women had illegally brought them across checkpoints for a day out \u2013 a journey that is both just a few miles and an impossible distance. This wasn&apos;t the first occasion; there have been previous trips to Tel Aviv and Jaffa and to the zoo in Jerusalem. For many of the Palestinians, it is their first trip across the Green Line into Israel. Earlier trips have been described by Ilana Hammerman, one of the organisers, in the Israeli paper Haaretz, and by Rachel Shabi in the Guardian last September. But in recent weeks, the Israelis \u2013 who describe themselves as &quot;women who disobey&quot; \u2013 have begun to be questioned individually by the police about their actions. Some see this as part of a bigger picture of intolerance and harassment of groups and individuals supporting co-existence, civil and human rights, and opposing Israel&apos;s occupation of Palestinian land. Many civil and human rights groups and politicians across the spectrum here detect a growing campaign against those challenging the &quot;norm&quot; of occupation. That, on a small and individual scale, is what these disobedient women are doing. Two weeks ago, Nitza Aminov was questioned for an hour by police who took her fingerprints and photograph for their records. She refused to answer their questions. She told me that more women have been told to expect visits from the police this week. Another, Meira, said police intimidation would not deter her from taking part in illegal days out. &quot;If we have to sit in jail as a result, we&apos;ll sit in jail.&quot; Hammerman has been questioned a few times, the first three months ago. &quot;I&apos;ve been public about challenging the law, acting in an illegal way,&quot; she told me. The risks are greater for the Palestinian women, who are likely to face a harsh punishment if discovered illegally in Israel.  One of them, Fida \u2013 who by lunchtime had replaced the headscarf she had removed to get through the checkpoint \u2013 was not afraid of getting caught. &quot;The Jewish people don&apos;t scare me \u2013 this is normal,&quot; she said.

But Middle Eastern migrants, labelled as &quot;Mizrahi&quot; [eastern] Jews were disproportionately dumped in development towns along Israel&apos;s borders; north, near Lebanon; south, near the Gaza strip; and east along the Green Line between Israel and the occupied West Bank. These towns \u2013 remote, underfunded, characterised by factory lines and vocational schools \u2013 were historically disadvantaged, creating a deep-seated resentment for residents. Mizrahim living in development towns today recall arriving in Israel during the 1950s and being bundled off to these remote places, then just tent and shack cities; taken by night, so they wouldn&apos;t see where they were going, and told that their new home was &quot;minutes&quot; from Tel Aviv or Haifa. Shilo&apos;s novel is a rare view of this world, sandwiched between two shades of animosity: the Lebanese rockets on one side and European-Israeli scorn on the other. She has lived here herself, during Israel&apos;s first war with Lebanon. When this prize-winning debut was published in Israel, as &quot;No Gnomes Shall Appear&quot;, one reviewer described it as &quot;untranslatable&quot;, since it would first have to be decoded from its Mizrahi border-town vernacular into standard Hebrew. Thankfully, the street style is not entirely lost in translation: it remains in the syntax and phraseology and the peppering of speech with Arabic words. And the ethnic issue is palpable throughout this account. It&apos;s there in the nursery school where the falafel king&apos;s widow, Simona, works, whose director tells staff they&apos;d better not talk &quot;Moroccan&quot; (Arabic), since the kids might pick it up. It is there when male characters say they are better off trying to find a wife overseas \u2013 because abroad, nobody says &quot;you look Moroccan&quot; or &quot;where in Israel are you from?&quot; It&apos;s there in the bleak factory where Simona&apos;s son Kobi works, and when he visits a better-heeled part of Israel and sees what a &quot;real&quot; house looks like. And it is painfully present when Simona claims that the only way to secure some dignity for her kids is to be hit by a Katyusha rocket, since &quot;whoever manages to be killed by Arabs is honoured like a king&quot;. When those rocket attacks are described, we see the crowded horror \u2013 but there isn&apos;t a sense of victimology or justification for Israel&apos;s deadly militarism. It is not fumes of hatred that rise up amid the blind fear caused by such attacks \u2013 a collective &quot;fear-monster&quot; spawned by the rockets and shame at the screaming and trampling that they cause. Meanwhile, the few Arab citizens of Israel (Palestinian families who stayed in Israel after its creation in 1948) in this novel are agents of calm and care; when Kobi has an emotional collapse, after years of being a premature adult following his dad&apos;s death, he ends up unintentionally seeking refuge with an Israeli Arab colleague, whose home is a haven for the troubled son. But at its core this story \u2013 which so struck the Israeli novelist David Grossman that he mentored it into publication \u2013 is a beautifully drawn account of a family collapsing under an unbearable loss, straining against the weight of a perverse secret \u2013 a lie that one of the family narrators explains has &quot;itself become a family member . . . no-one made it up; it was just born from itself&quot;. Pivoted on a death, this novel becomes a life-affirming story of love \u2013 a cluttered, clumsy family love that colours the characters and wills them into keeping on and moving forward. And it is this driving emotion that ultimately makes Shilo&apos;s first novel so readable and so engaging.

It was from an old soldier, who had found Warriors moving, and wanted to thank its director. At the end of the letter, though, was a line \u2013 thrown out more in hope than expectation \u2013 that caught Kosminsky&apos;s eye. &quot;You should do a film about the British soldiers who were in Palestine,&quot; it said. &quot;No one remembers us.&quot; As psychological bullets go, this one was well aimed. Kosminsky is nothing if not in the business of remembering. The kind of things that governments like to forget are his stock in trade. Down the years, he has made films on a variety of uncomfortable subjects, from the activities of the police in Northern Ireland (Shoot to Kill) and New Labour control-freakery (The Project), to British-born Muslim suicide bombers (Britz) and the suicide of Dr David Kelly (The Government Inspector), each one trailing controversy \u2013 if not always a sudden bout of recovered memory on the part of the establishment \u2013 in its wake. The soldier&apos;s letter was duly passed to Kosminsky&apos;s researchers, who began interviewing veterans. Between 1945 and 1948, some 100,000 soldiers served in the British-controlled Mandate of Palestine. Kosminsky&apos;s team spoke to around 80; he found the men&apos;s stories to be both gripping and moving, so he carried on, wading next through letters, diaries, memoirs and history books. Slowly, a theme began to emerge. &quot;The thing that came out most strongly,&quot; he says, &quot;was that the men all arrived in Palestine feeling incredibly pro-Jewish. A few of them had helped to liberate the [concentration] camps, so they had seen what had happened [to the Jews] with their own eyes. And everyone had heard the stories and seen the newsreels. &quot;When Jewish refugees arrived in Palestine off the boats, and were caged and beaten by British forces [the British placed strict limitations on Jewish immigration to Palestine], many soldiers didn&apos;t like it all. They knew what these people had been through. Over time, though, the soldiers&apos; attitudes changed. Some of this was just the usual British support for the underdog; there&apos;s no question that by 1948 [when Israel declared itself an independent state] the Arabs were perceived as that. But also, if you&apos;re being attacked on a daily basis [by the Jewish resistance], if you&apos;re under constant threat of kidnap, if you&apos;re confined to barracks behind a lot of razor wire, your feelings are bound to change.&quot; Kosminsky&apos;s first idea was to make a drama about a British soldier who would exemplify this shift. &quot;I suppose it started out as standard Kosminsky fare, which was pointing the finger at Britain. First of all, these men don&apos;t have a memorial; they&apos;re forgotten. It&apos;s only recently that they were allowed to march to the Cenotaph. When they came back to Britain, no one wanted to know; pulling out of Palestine was a terrible humiliation, a total defeat. Second, we were the colonial power in Palestine and, as in so many other examples of our retreat from Empire, we left it totally fucked up. Chaos. We washed our hands of it. I wanted to say: if you think the Israeli-Palestinian situation is not our problem, think again. We were there, we left, and 60 years later, it is still a problem.&quot; The trouble was, something else kept nagging away at him. &quot;The more I read their stories, the more I began to be struck by some odd parallels,&quot; he says. &quot;For instance, if there&apos;s a suicide bombing in Israel, usually the Israeli Defence Force immediately goes [to the West Bank or Gaza] and blows up the house of the bomber. I&apos;d always assumed this tactic had been invented in the modern era. But in the veterans&apos; interviews, they described doing exactly the same thing. When a member of Etzel [the Israeli name for Irgun, the Zionist paramilitary group that operated in the Mandate of Palestine from 1931 until 1948] or Lehi [better known as the Stern Gang, another militant Zionist group] attacked them, the British would find the family home and dynamite it.&quot; On the other side stood the Irgun, as ruthless as any 21st-century terrorist organisation. When the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which served as the British Mandatory authorities&apos; headquarters, was bombed in July 1946, 91 people died, many of them civilians. &quot;They were extremely effective. You only have to compare the attack on the King David to something like the Brighton Bomb [in which the IRA killed five people] to see that. There&apos;s a moving memoir by the colonial secretary, who survived. He spent a week attending the funerals of his friends, became unhinged and had to be invalided out. He lost his reason.&quot; Somewhere along the line, Kosminsky decided that his film would need to tell two stories: one set in the Mandate of Palestine, the other in Israel, 2011. Eleven years later and the result of all this research and ambition is shortly to be screened on Channel 4. Was it worth it? I think it would have been worth it if it had taken him twice as long. The Promise, which will be screened in four parts, and runs to some seven and a half hours, is the best thing you are likely to see on television this year, if not this decade. It is not only that it is so exciting, moving, and full of exquisite performances; it&apos;s also that the extraordinary detail and thoughtfulness of it \u2013 the sheer scale of the canvas on which its director works \u2013 subtly imparts so many emotional and factual truths that you feel your own allegiances, whatever they may be, suddenly shifting uneasily, sometimes on a minute-by-minute basis. Revelatory is an overused word, but The Promise is exactly that: the power of its storytelling will open eyes more effectively than any leaked document, any piece of rhetoric, any news bulletin. The series begins in Britain, where a student, Erin (Claire Foy), is helping to clear out her elderly grandfather&apos;s house. On a dusty shelf, she finds his diary, an account of his experiences as a sergeant, first at Bergen-Belsen and then in Palestine. Erin has a friend, Eliza, who has an Israeli passport, and who must shortly fly out to Tel Aviv to do her military service. Erin, wilful and increasingly intrigued by her grandfather&apos;s spidery handwriting, decides to take up a nervous Eliza&apos;s invitation to stay with her well-to-do Israeli family while her friend embarks on her military training. Thereafter, Kosminsky tells us two stories: there is Len (Christian Cooke), Erin&apos;s grandfather, who will find himself and his men constantly under attack by the Irgun, but who will also have life-changing relationships with both a young Jewish woman, Clara, and a Palestinian man, Hassan, who works as a tea-wallah in his barracks; and there is Erin, whose stay in Israel turns into something rather more than a gap-year adventure, thanks to Paul, Eliza&apos;s peace activist brother, and to the diary, whose central secret will lead her to embark on an extraordinary quest. It is Erin who will honour, on behalf of her dying grandfather, the promise of the series&apos; title. It could so easily have been clunky, all this flipping backwards and forwards. But Kosminsky flicks between the two periods boldly, unself-consciously, as if all the silted history between them was nothing more than a couple of bits of lint, to be brushed off a lapel. Over the course of a long career (he celebrates 30 years in television this year) Kosminsky has become adept at turning one country into another: &quot;I used the Czech Republic for Bosnia, Kenya for Somalia, Ghana for Liberia, Morocco for Iraq, India for Pakistan and Leeds for Northern Ireland.&quot; This time, though, there was no faking it. &quot;Israel looks like nowhere else: the Bauhaus architecture in Tel Aviv, the physiognomy of its people, who come from all over the world, and most of all the Wall [separating Israel from the Palestinian territories]. I knew I couldn&apos;t recreate those things. The trouble was, it is virtually unknown for a British TV crew to shoot in Israel. We were starting from zero.&quot; Was it difficult? In person, Kosminsky is adorably mild-mannered; it&apos;s almost impossible to imagine him sitting in a director&apos;s chair, shouting into a loud-hailer. &quot;It wasn&apos;t without its problems,&quot; he says, softly. &quot;Every time we applied to shoot in a public building, permission was always denied, and no reason was ever given.&quot; Undaunted, he pressed on. Acre, a city in northern Israel, doubled as Hebron, in the West Bank; Jisr al-Zarka, Israel&apos;s poorest Arab village, stood service as Gaza; an Israeli border checkpoint was built from scratch. Kosminsky&apos;s crew was largely Israeli, and he was struck by how their demeanour would change in certain places. &quot;In East Jerusalem, for instance, they would be very subdued. I had not realised what a big deal it would be. I spoke to one of them, and he said: &apos;We just don&apos;t come here. I&apos;ve only been here once in my life, and that was as a child.&apos;&quot; Sometimes there were difficulties with actors, too. Although there are many celebrated examples of cross-casting in Israeli and Palestinian films, Kosminsky was determined that Israelis would be played only by Israelis, and Arabs only by Arabs (a decision that paid incredible dividends: the Israeli actor, Itay Tiran, who plays Paul, and Ali Suliman, who plays Hassan, both turn in great performances). &quot;There&apos;s a scene in which an Israeli soldier uses a Palestinian girl as a human shield. We had documentary examples of this and, in the week we were shooting, an Israeli soldier was found guilty in court of doing precisely that. Nobody could deny it occurred, but the actor I cast to play my commander pulled out during rehearsals. I don&apos;t think he had realised that the woman opposite him from whom he had to take the child would be Palestinian. &apos;I know these things happen,&apos; he said. &apos;But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean I want to portray it.&apos;&quot; How much of the Mandate-era story could be said to be true? &quot;The vast majority of it,&quot; says Kosminsky. Were two British intelligence officers kidnapped, tortured and lynched by the Irgun? Yes. In 1947, Sergeant Clifford Martin and Sergeant Mervyn Paice, both British military policemen, were kept in an airless hole in the ground for 18 days, and then hanged. Were young Jewish women paid as hostesses in city hospitality clubs for the purposes of propagandising about Israel to British officers? Yes. And for these women, old ladies now, the stigma still remains; somewhat ironically, Zionists accused them of fraternising with the enemy. Did British soldiers go AWOL, joining both Arab and Israeli fighters in the months leading up to Israel&apos;s declaration of independence? Yes. At one point, the only two tanks in the possession of the fledgling Israeli army were courtesy of defectors (the incentive was not always ideological; Haganah, another Jewish paramilitary group, offered huge sums of cash to defectors who brought military hardware with them). For the sake of drama, there are elisions. But critics will struggle if they accuse Kosminsky of exaggeration. Although he grew up in an atheist household in Stanmore, north London, Kosminsky is, as he puts it &quot;racially Jewish&quot;; his paternal grandfather came to Britain, aged three, as a refugee from pogroms in Poland. So it&apos;s striking that, before making The Promise, he had never been to Israel (and even more amazing when you consider his globe-trotting career; when he made the documentary Afghantsi for Yorkshire Television in 1988, about the experiences of Russian soldiers in the Afghan war, he rode in a Soviet tank as it rolled out of Kabul). How did it strike him? &quot;I didn&apos;t have too many preconceptions. I tried to look at it through the eyes of Erin, who is based on my daughters. Tel Aviv, where I lived during the shoot, is a beach town, a party town. They call it the bubble. This is very personal, but people weren&apos;t at all like the Jews I knew growing up, who tended to be intellectual, wanted to discuss things into the ground. This was the opposite. It was brash, almost nihilistic. But I felt detached, mostly. I was there to do a job. I never felt part of the place.&quot; Did he have no sense at all of homecoming? He smiles. &quot;No! Although maybe that&apos;s a deficiency in me. There is a part of me that feels British, and a part of me that doesn&apos;t; but the truth is, the battle between them is one-sided. I&apos;m very, very proud to call myself British. I&apos;m proud of being a Jew, too, but it&apos;s not who I am. I wasn&apos;t thinking: the Jewish sanctuary! I was thinking: I&apos;m homesick.&quot; I would describe The Promise as the work of a film-maker at his zenith, if that didn&apos;t suggest that he might now be on his way back down. But his progress to this point has not been without its trials. Kosminsky, who read chemistry at Oxford (in the fullness of time, his Communist father, who started out sewing pockets for Savile Row tailors, sent his son to Haberdashers&apos; Aske&apos;s, a public school, with Oxford in mind) likes to describe the moment he decided on his future career: during a holiday, he was watching Ken Loach&apos;s Days of Hope, a television series about the British Labour movement. In a scene in an Irish pub, a group of British soldiers grew ever more dangerously rowdy until the teenage girl they had been baiting stood on a chair and sang a song about missing Ireland, at which point they morphed into just another group of homesick squaddies. Kosminsky felt the power of Loach&apos;s work. This was what he wanted to do. A BBC traineeship followed, but when he was fired as a script editor \u2013 long story \u2013 he moved to Yorkshire Television. There, he began working on documentaries and later on what we now call factual drama, it having occurred to him that certain subjects \u2013 like Northern Ireland, where people were too terrified to be interviewed \u2013 could only be effectively tackled with the help of fiction. When he was fired from YTV, he set up his own production company, and bagged himself a &quot;first look&quot; deal at the BBC, where Warriors won several awards. In 2003, he left the BBC and struck a similar deal with Channel 4. Why? &quot;I spent a long time trying to make it work at the BBC, but then three projects I developed over many years were canned, which made me pretty cross.&quot; According to Kosminsky, film-makers like him no longer see &quot;that flash of mischief&quot; in the eyes of commissioning editors when they turn up at the BBC to pitch ideas. Does he see it at Channel 4? (It seems hard to believe at the home of wall-to-wall Come Dine With Me and obesity freak shows.) He laughs. There&apos;s always dross around. &quot;When I was a trainee at the BBC, my main preoccupation was moaning to Alasdair Milne [the then director general] about a show called Blankety Blank. In Channel 4, I found my natural home.&quot; Maybe so. But I can&apos;t help but worry. I hope the new regime at Channel 4 understands what it&apos;s got in Kosminsky. I hope they cherish him. Whatever The Promise makes you think or feel about Israel, it is a beautiful and peerless example of what television can still do when it tries.

The 280-page report of the Turkel Commission broadly endorsed the Israeli military and government versions of events on 31 May. Witnesses on board the lead ship, the Mavi Marmara, on which nine Turkish activists were killed, vigorously contested the Israeli accounts. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister of Turkey whose relations with Israel reached breaking point after the raid, today rejected the conclusions of the commission, saying it had &quot;no value or credibility&quot;. The report found that Israeli naval commandos were met with violence when they boarded the Mavi Marmara. It identified a key group of about 100 &quot;IHH activists&quot; \u2013 referring to a Turkish organisation that Israel accuses of having links to Hamas, the Islamist organisation that runs Gaza. &quot;The IHH activists carried out the violence on board the Mavi Marmara by arming themselves with a wide array of weapons, including iron bars, axes, clubs, slingshots, knives and metal objects. These weapons were capable of causing death or serious injury,&quot; the report said. The IHH activists used firearms against the soldiers, it added. &quot;Overall, the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] personnel acted professionally in the face of extensive and unanticipated violence,&quot; it concluded. It said the IDF&apos;s interception and capture of the vessels in the flotilla conformed with international law. The military&apos;s use of force also complied with international law in 127 cases, said the report. There were six cases that were inconclusive. Activists on board the vessels said the Israeli military initiated the violence and used disproportionate force in the ensuing battle. The commission also found that Israel&apos;s naval blockade of Gaza, which the flotilla was attempting to breach, was primarily for security reasons and was imposed lawfully. It added that it did not &quot;constitute &apos;collective punishment&apos; of the population of the Gaza Strip&quot;. &quot;Israel is complying with the humanitarian obligations imposed on the blockading party, including the prohibition of starving the civilian population or preventing the supply of objects essential for survival,&quot; said the report. Gisha, an Tel Aviv-based rights organisation, said in a statement that &quot;a primary goal of the restrictions, as declared by Israel, was to paralyse the economy in Gaza and prevent its residents from leading normal lives&quot;. It challenged the commission&apos;s conclusion that restrictions were justified for military reasons. Israel eased its blockade on Gaza under international pressure in the aftermath of the flotilla raid. However there are still severe restrictions on the import of construction materials, exports and freedom of movement. After the report&apos;s publication, the Turkish foreign ministry said: &quot;Israel&apos;s attack against the humanitarian aid convoy, which violated both wartime and peacetime international law, has also trampled all international principles, rules and norms with the manner in which it was conducted.&quot; Sarah Colbourne, of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, who was on the Marvi Marmara, said: &quot;The facts are simple, the Marvi Marmara was carrying essential humanitarian aid like baby milk to the besieged people of Gaza. There were no guns or weapons on board the boat, we were in international waters, when over 300 bullets rained down on us.&quot; Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said: &quot;Israel acted in justifiable self-defence. Our soldiers acted to protect themselves and to protect their country. Then as now, Iran seeks to smuggle lethal weaponry to Hamas in Gaza.&quot; The conclusions of the commission, headed by retired supreme court judge Yaakov Turkel, were endorsed by two international observers, who were appointed after claims that an internal Israeli investigation into the flotilla raid would not be objective. Former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble and Brigadier-General Ken Watkin of Canada said in a letter accompanying the report that the commission was independent and rigorous. Israel intercepted the flotilla in international waters, claiming that the boats could be carrying arms or materials that could be used by militants. The nine casualties were all Turkish citizens, who between them sustained 30 bullet wounds. Although Israel rebuffed calls for an international investigation, it faced criticism over its choice of commissioners, with critics saying the outcome of the inquiry would be a whitewash. The Turkel commission will continue to investigate the political decision-making process in the runup to the raid. A second report is expected later this year. Among those who gave evidence to the commission were Netanyahu, the defence minister, Ehud Barak, and army chief Gabi Ashkenazi. The commission was barred from questioning soldiers.

JONES&apos; FIRST MEETINGS IN ISRAEL Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S) Summary. Special Envoy for Middle East Security, retired General James L. Jones, met with Prime Minister Olmert, Defense Minister Barak, IDF Chief of General Staff Ashkenazi and members of the General Staff, Foreign Minister Livni, and Israel Security Agency head Diskin December 18. In all of his meetings, General Jones described his mandate as developing a security plan to address the needs that will arise from the establishment of a Palestinian state, factoring in the equities of Israel and other regional partners. He made clear that he will not be involved in monitoring the implementation of Phase One of the Roadmap, as has been reported repeatedly in the Israeli press. Barak and PM Olmert set the tone, offering full cooperation and support for Jones&apos; work. In each meeting, the Israelis described their concerns about the security impact of a two-state solution on Israel due to Israel&apos;s small size and population, the heavy concentration of Israel&apos;s population and economic centers along the narrow coastal plain, their lack of confidence in the Palestinians&apos; security capabilities, and the range of regional threats Israel faces. At the same time, most of them reiterated their support for an agreement with the Palestinians and progress toward a two-state solution. FM Livni emphasized that she did not look at security issues with a view to finding an excuse not to move forward. Rather, she felt it essential to look at security issues so that implementation of the two state vision could be done &quot;the right way.&quot; General Jones indicated that this was an introductory visit and that he plans to return to discuss the issues in greater detail following the January visit of President Bush. Olmert indicated that he and Barak planned to assign a senior IDF defense expert, probably MG Ido Nechushtan, to serve as a liaison to General Jones. DAO will report in detail in their channels the strategic threats briefing provided by MG Nechushtan to General Jones. End Summary. BARAK: CONSIDER THE REGIONAL THREATS ------------------------------------- 2. (S) General Jones&apos; GOI meetings began with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who was joined by IDF Chief of General Staff Gabi Ashkenazi and most of the MOD and IDF senior staff. General Jones was accompanied by the Ambassador, Army Attache, and PolCouns. After introducing the MOD and IDF senior staff and explaining their responsibilities, Barak observed that seen from a narrow focus on Israel and the Palestinians, Israel appears to be much the stronger party, but once the focus is expanded to cover the array of regional threats to Israel, Israel is the party that is threatened with extinction. The role of the IDF, he said, is to prevent that from happening. The triad of nuclear proliferation, Islamist terrorism, and rogue states poses a gathering threat. The IDF is engaged in daily clashes with Palestinian terror organizations, some of which are guided from Syria and supported by Iran. Hizballah and Syria have growing ground-to-ground missile capabilities directed against Israel, but Israel had just dealt with an even more serious threat from Syria. On Iran, Barak said Israel differs with the latest National Intelligence Estimate, but he did not elaborate. 3. (S) Turning to the negotiations with the Palestinians, Barak said there would only be minor modifications of the 1967 borders. Israel would need to retain the settlement blocs around Jerusalem and in the northern West Bank, but give up the other settlements. Since the Palestinian border would only be nine miles from the sea, Israel&apos;s security margin would require that the Palestinian state be demilitarized. Israel would retain control of the air space, as well as military access to the Jordan Valley for years to come. Gaza would have to be part of any solution, he noted, it could not be left as a separate entity for which the Palestinian government was not responsible. 4. (C) General Jones reviewed his military career, including a number of visits to Israel and interactions with the IDF. He noted that since retiring as NATO Supreme Commander and USEUCOM Commander in February, he had worked on a project involving the national security implications of energy issues for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as writing a report for the Congress on the Iraqi security services. Secretary Rice had then asked him to come back part-time to develop a security plan for a Palestinian state that would take account of regional equities. He stressed that monitoring the Roadmap is not in his mandate. Barak offered the MOD&apos;s full support, noting that he would be clear about Israel&apos;s security needs. IDF BRIEFING ------------ 5. (S) IDF J-5 MG Ido Nechushtan, IDF Deputy Chief of Staff MG Dan Harel, and Israel Defense Intelligence head Amos Yadlin escorted General Jones, the Ambassador, Defense Attache, and PolCouns to the helopad on the roof of the Ministry of Defense tower in downtown Tel Aviv. Nechushtan pointed out the topographical vulnerabilities of greater Tel Aviv and Israel&apos;s coastal plain vis a vis the nearby ridges of the West Bank. At a follow-on briefing, Nechushtan stressed the security challenges posed by a Palestinian state. Unlike the Olso process, a peace agreement would not replace security, but security arrangements would ensure peace. Israel&apos;s security requirements would need to be addressed from the beginning of the process since Israel had no response time or strategic depth. Israel&apos;s coastal strip includes seventy percent of Israel&apos;s population and eighty percent of its GDP, and a Palestinian state would be immediately adjacent. In order to compensate for this increased risk, a Palestinian state would have to be completely demilitarized, with Israel in control of Palestine&apos;s air space and land borders. There would need to be special security arrangements to protect Jerusalem and Ben Gurion Airport. Israel would also retain security control of the Jordan Valley, while maintaining early warning and intelligence gathering sites on the tops of the West Bank hills. The land link between the West Bank and Gaza would have to be under Israeli control as well. 6. (S) IDI Chief Yadlin dismissed the PA&apos;s security capabilities, saying it would take a minimum of three to five years before the Palestinians could assume security responsibility for the West Bank. Terror organizations in the West Bank are highly motivated but their capabilities are limited due to the daily actions of the IDF and Shin Bet. Chief of General Staff Ashkenazi stressed that the Annapolis process must put security first. Most Israelis now believe in a two-state solution, he said, it was not even particularly controversial. The problem was security, he said, citing statistics that suicide bombers from the West Bank had killed 220 Israelis and wounded 1320 in 2002, but had not killed or wounded any Israelis in 2007 due to IDF action in 2002-03 to clean out the West Bank and build the fence. If Israel handed over security responsibility to the PA today, it would all start again. The burden must be on the PA to prove that it can take over. 7. (C) Noting the Marine Corps&apos; counter-insurgency doctrine of not making more enemies and not harming the civilian population, General Jones asked whether the IDF&apos;s concept included economic development, reconstruction, and education and training. Nechushtan said these elements were linked to security. Tony Blair understood that and coordinated the security element for his projects. The MOD had reviewed Blair&apos;s projects and approved them. The problem here was to prepare for what will be needed once the PA is independent. Yadlin pointed out that if Qassam rockets were put in the West Bank, they could do much more damage than those fired from Gaza. MG Harel recalled that he had commanded the September 2005 evacuation of Gaza. At the time he had expected there would be peace, but instead terrorists had fired about 3,000 rockets at Israel since the withdrawal. OLMERT: A LONG WAY TO GO ON THE GROUND --------------------------------------- 8. (C) The Ambassador and PolCouns accompanied General Jones to his meeting with Prime Minister Olmert in the PM&apos;s private office. The Prime Minister&apos;s Chief of Staff Yoram Turbowicz and Foreign Policy Adviser Shalom Tourgeman joined Olmert. General Jones reviewed his official visits and professional contacts with Israel since 1981 to Olmert&apos;s evident satisfaction. Olmert commented that he understood that Jones would not be the one to judge Roadmap performance, but rather he would be looking at security issues in light of the emergence of a Palestinian state, factoring in Jordanian and Israeli equities. Olmert called this an important mission due to the dominant influence of the U.S. It would be demanding and time consuming. 9. (C) The Prime Minister commented he was less pessimistic than most Israelis, but even so that he did not think a solution with the Palestinians was as close as Secretary Rice would like. There was still a &quot;long way to go&quot; on the ground, he said. During a visit to the IDF Central Command on the West Bank ten days prior, the commanders had told Olmert that cooperation with the PA security forces was improving, as was the West Bank economy and quality of life. But responsibility for counter-terrorism operations remained fully in Israeli hands, PA security forces were only performing civil law enforcement. If the IDF withdrew, Hamas would take over. 10. (S) Olmert said he was impressed by the extent of international support for the PA, as demonstrated by over USD 7 billion in pledges at the Paris donors&apos; conference. Nonetheless, the question of how it would be transferred remained. Olmert said he had heard that the Saudi assistance would only go to projects, which he said he would be happy to see. The problem was that he did not see the PA developing the &quot;iron fist&quot; they would need to kick the terrorist organizations out of the West Bank. Gaza was lost to Hamas and Abbas had no plans for taking it back. The PA says the Palestinian state must include Gaza but they do not want to take responsibility for it. 11. (S) Olmert cautioned Jones that he must understand many layers of language in the Arab world. For example, in their one-on-one meetings, President Abbas always asks Olmert to take tougher actions against Hamas and its Gaza leadership. But when the IDF carries out operations in Gaza that kill terrorists, Saeb Erekat writes a letter to the UN complaining about it. Olmert said that the Palestinians say one thing to Secretary Rice and then ask him to do the opposite. SIPDIS 12. (S) After expressing satisfaction at IDF operations in Gaza the previous day that had killed ten members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including the head of the PIJ military wing in Gaza, Olmert asked Jones how he expected to work with the MOD and IDF. Jones replied that he would work openly with them. This was only an introductory visit, but he would return after the President&apos;s visit and return regularly, working with a small staff. Olmert said he would ask Barak to assign a senior &quot;defense intellectual&quot; to liaise with Jones, most likely MG Nechushtan. Turbowicz commented that they were there to help Jones in every way. Olmert reiterated that point, saying he wanted Jones to succeed. The GOI wanted to move forward with the Palestinians, and both sides were in need of General Jones&apos; advice. ISA DISKIN: READY TO PROVIDE FOCUSED SECURITY BRIEFS --------------------------------------------- ------- 13. (S) General Jones discussed his security mission with ISA Director Yuval Diskin, and emphasized that while he was not a stranger to Israel, he had worked principally with the IDF. Diskin described Shin Bet&apos;s mandate and activities in Israel and the territories, and the complicated reality of Israel&apos;s security environment. He underscored the problems posed by smuggling of weaponry across the Philadelphi corridor (between Egypt and Gaza) and stressed it was only part of a larger smuggling network: &quot;Explosives come from Africa via the Sudan-Egypt-Suez-Sinai route, or via the Red Sea.&quot; Bedouin tribes provide the &quot;Arab conductivity&quot; between Egypt and Jordan (via Israel). People, too, are smuggled across the Sinai, from Eritrea, Somalia and Darfur (Sudan), Diskin added. He contrasted the laxity of Egyptian security control at Suez, which he said could easily be a chokepoint for GOE efforts to control smuggling, and in the Sinai with the seriousness of the Jordanians. Diskin stressed the strategic importance of Jordan, and the need for Israel to take account Jordanian interests. 14. (S) Diskin said Israel&apos;s main threat came from the West Bank, and that the security zone, especially in the northern West Bank, had been critical to Israel&apos;s success in countering that threat. Diskin underscored how Israel&apos;s &quot;opportunity to control movement&quot; in the West Bank contributed to Israel&apos;s security. He described how the number of Israeli victims had peaked in 2002, and had tapered off since the construction of the separation barrier and Operation Defensive Shield in 2002. Diskin reported that while 1100 Israelis had been killed since 2000, yet only ten Israeli civilians and soldiers had been killed by Palestinians in 2007 (in Israel or the territories). Israeli control of passages and the movement of persons between the West Bank and Jordan or between Israel and Gaza provides security. 15. (S) In response to Gen. Jones&apos; question about the extent of Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, Diskin, who said he has been closely involved with Palestinian affairs since 1993, noted that even in the worst of times, Shin Bet had maintained contacts with Palestinian security services. He singled out the new Palestinian military intelligence chief in the West Bank as one of the only new faces, and one who was somewhat more serious than the others had been. (Diskin cited the Palestinian response to terrorism in 1996 as the only time when PA security forces proved to be serious and effective.) Diskin assessed that the Palestinian security establishment is &quot;broken, not professional, reactive rather than proactive.&quot; Their establishment lacks a &quot;circle of enforcement&quot; (intelligence gathering, investigation, arrest and interrogation, and trial in a court of law). Instead, during the 1997-2000 period, the Palestinian Preventive Security Organization and the General Intelligence typically &quot;completed Israeli operations in areas where they were &apos;sovereign.&apos;&quot; 16. (S) On training (of Palestinian security forces), Diskin said he preferred that there be one trainer, not several. DCM Moreno noted that all of the next 700 Palestinian trainees would be trained in Jordan. On Gaza, Diskin said the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) operatives killed on December 17-18 &quot;were only part of the problem,&quot; Diskin did not think Israel could stand the status quo for many months, or risk importing the Gaza reality to the West Bank. A Gaza-like rocket threat in the West Bank would endanger Israeli industry and population centers. &quot;That&apos;s why the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are not connected,&quot; Diskin concluded. LIVNI: EAGER TO DISCUSS SECURITY WITH U.S., THEN PA --------------------------------------------- ------- 17. (C) Gen. Jones recalled his familiarity with Israel and the IDF, his frequent training missions in Israel, and his encouragement of military-military contacts between NATO and Israel in the framework of the NATO Mediterranean dialogue. He discussed his mission with FM Livni, highlighting that the paper he envisioned as the outcome would apply more to future realities rather than the present situation on the ground. He stressed that he did not have Road map or referee in his job description, and asked Livni for her perspective. 18. (S) FM Livni characterized security as the most important core issue, one that has yet to be addressed: &quot;Two states living side by side in peace in security has not been translated into an understanding.&quot; She traced the path that she had taken from ideological attachment (to the idea of Greater Israel) to the need for two states so as to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and to preserve Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Livni stressed the importance of Israel and the U.S. (and eventually Israel and the Palestinians) coming to such an understanding as to the meaning of living side by side with a Palestinian state in peace and security. &quot;The word security is just too vague; it is not a real plan. We need you (Gen. Jones): your mandate and mission is crucial to the process.&quot; She said that Israel has its own ideas regarding the region, alliances, and, like Diskin, acknowledged the importance of strategic allies such as Jordan. Livni felt it critical that security issues needed to be addressed soon, as the political negotiations with the Palestinians are now getting under way. &quot;I would like to be in a position, as Israel&apos;s negotiator, to share many of our security concerns (with the U.S.).&quot; As negotiator, she said she would need to represent Israel&apos;s security needs in negotiations with the Palestinians and underscored her close collaboration with the Ministry of Defense. 19. (S) Livni outlined a number of the strategic challenges and questions Israel faced, and said Israel was looking for answers to &quot;strategic questions&quot; with a view to finding ways to implement policy. She hoped to turn first to Gen. Jones, as &quot;it will not be easy on the bilateral (Israeli-Palestinian track) to get to understandings.&quot; -- Where does Gaza lead us? Is it a strategic threat? Is the Gaza Strip part of a Palestinian state? -- The Philadelphi corridor is a Palestinian and Israeli security concern, and, while there are mutual interests, there will be areas of difference between the current PA and the GOI. -- Should Israel support a seaport or airport for the Palestinians, now, or even in the future? (No, in her view). -- Will the formation of a Palestinian state resolve some security challenges, or create new problems for Israel? -- Would the Palestinian state be demilitarized? How would connections between a Palestinian state and other states, particularly the Jordan Valley be controlled? Would there be a passage between Gaza and the West Bank? -- Abbas embraced the French idea of an international force in the region in his remarks in Paris. Are such forces willing to fight Hamas house-to-house? She doubted it. -- Does it make sense for Israel to support economic projects in the West Bank when some joint ventures actually create security problems for Israel? Is there an organized plan? What does Palestinian capacity-building mean? -- Will Palestinians chose Fatah in the future? -- Iran poses a traditional &quot;20th century&quot; type of threat to Israel, but other, non-state actors, in places such as Lebanon are posing new threats. 20. (S) Livni emphasized that she did not look at security issues with a view to finding an excuse not to move forward. Rather, she felt it essential to look at security issues so that implementation of the two state vision could be done &quot;the right way.&quot; She underscored that when it comes to security, the idea is not to bridge gaps but to clarify what needs to be done to achieve security. Gen. Jones concurred, adding that &quot;I&apos;m not a negotiator or a mediator.&quot; He told Livni that he would return by the end of January with a small team, and &quot;won&apos;t be silent&quot; in the meantime. Gen. Jones also clarified that his job description would require him to look at the &quot;equities of the region with regard to security issues, primarily vis a vis Israel and the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan.&quot; 21. (U) General Jones did not clear this cable.

They reveal that our previous government, led by Ehud Olmert as prime minister and Tzipi Livni as foreign minister, discussed a detailed partition plan involving serious give and take with its Palestinian interlocutors. Alas, the Palestine papers also reveal the lack of political will to conclude the deal, shown by the wide gaps over substantive positions, and both sides&apos; leaning towards fruitless debating, rather than seeking a compromise. The first batch of papers gives a detailed account, partly verbatim, of the Annapolis process that lasted from November 2007 to late 2008. While the contents and maps of Olmert&apos;s proposal to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, have been published before, now, for the first time, we get a glimpse of the Palestinian counter-proposal on borders, security, and Jerusalem. The details indicate that Annapolis was the most serious attempt so far at reaching an Israeli-Palestinian deal. Mocked upon its inception as an empty drill of powerless leaders, Annapolis saw both sides&apos; leaders put all outstanding issues on the table and offer solutions. The mechanism of quiet talks below the media radar and low expectations allowed for more progress than the high-expectation, media-event conferences of Camp David vintage. The Bush administration, and particularly Condoleezza Rice, deserves more credit that it usually gets for its contribution to Middle East peacemaking. Rather than &quot;shrugging it off,&quot; as the myth goes, or simply serving as Israel&apos;s diplomatic shield, the Bush team facilitated the removal of 25 Israeli settlements from Gaza and the West Bank in 2005, and pushed for a final-status deal in Annapolis. To be sure, Rice is less than pushy in her leaked conversations with Livni and the Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qurei. Perhaps a more assertive US approach could narrow the gaps. Both sides&apos; positions on territory \u2013 the basic element of any deal \u2013 show agreement on the principle of an independent Palestine within the 1967 borders, amended through territorial swaps to compensate the Palestinians for West Bank settlements annexed to Israel. Their agreement marks an Israeli victory. The fathers of Israel&apos;s settlement enterprise, like Moshe Dayan, envisaged border changes through settlement building. However grudgingly, the Palestinians now propose a new border, which incorporates the largest settlements near the old Green Line into Israel. This is particularly true in East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians accepted the principle of ethnic partition among neighbourhoods. Thus most settlers would remain on the Israeli side, and Israel could expand its perilous &quot;narrow waists&quot; around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Here agreement ends. The Palestinians refused to acknowledge the annexation of major settlements \u2013 Ma&apos;ale Adumim, Ariel, Efrata, Givat Ze&apos;ev, and Har Homa (in south Jerusalem) \u2013 that carve up the West Bank into loosely connected Palestinian enclaves. But these areas, especially Ma&apos;ale Adumim and Ariel, have been enshrined in the Israeli political catechism as &quot;parts of Israel for ever&quot; \u2013 and Livni duly expressed this position to the Palestinians&apos; chagrin. While the disputed areas are relatively small in acreage, disagreement over them can kill the deal. The security clauses invoked similar differences. What Israel considers as necessary measures to protect its citizens, such as border and airspace controls, the Palestinians view as occupation in disguise. The Palestinian negotiators cited their fear of Hamas and other adversaries who may exploit any compromise to embarrass and weaken Abbas. Interestingly, Livni did not use similar arguments of political disability. But in effect each side was trying to export its civil war to the other. Evacuating more and bigger settlements would only deepen the inevitable domestic crisis in Israel, while swallowing Ma&apos;ale Adumim and Ariel could undermine the legitimacy of any Palestinian government. That&apos;s why the Palestinians never bought Livni&apos;s suggestions that they should accept less than their aspirations. Unlike the Irish, who took the British offer, established their republic in the south and left Ulster to the future, the Palestinians insist on fulfilling what they consider as their &quot;rights&quot;. Was peace within reach and a major opportunity missed? The political odds were against it, with Bush&apos;s lame-duck presidency reaching its end and Olmert&apos;s downfall over corruption allegations, followed by Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. There was not enough political capital around to fuel a compromise. But despite the principle that &quot;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot;, nothing is forgotten either. The papers, especially the leaked maps, will serve as the starting point for future negotiations. Moreover, they undermine the &quot;no partner&quot; doctrine of Israel&apos;s current leadership trio: Binyamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak and Avigdor Lieberman. While falling short of accepting Israel&apos;s positions, Abbas and Qurei have not simply pocketed Olmert&apos;s proposals and walked away, as Israel argues. They negotiated in earnest. Notwithstanding his anger at their publication, the papers give Abbas a strong hand in his diplomatic jiujitsu match with Netanyahu. If he can stand by his proposals in the face of adversaries and detractors, Abbas will show his political courage \u2013 and prove to be the partner we seek.  \u2022 Comments on this article will be open for 24 hours ", "publicationDate": "2011-01-25T09:00:12Z", "title": "The Palestine papers help Abbas in the diplomatic jiujitsu | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["Thus most settlers would remain on the Israeli side, and Israel could expand its perilous &quot;narrow waists&quot; around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/25/palestine-papers-abbas-partner-peace"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Gaza", "The Palestine papers", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Hassan al-Madhoun got a martyr&apos;s funeral \u2013 his body borne aloft on a stretcher, blood seeping through the bandages swathing his head as masked men fired machine-gun volleys into the air and crowds called for revenge. Madhoun&apos;s life ended in Gaza&apos;s Jabaliya refugee camp on 1 November 2005 when the car he was travelling in with another Palestinian fighter was incinerated by a missile fired from an Israeli drone, its operators clearly aware of the identity of their target. Ten other people were wounded by the blast. Behind the killing, leaked documents from the Palestine papers reveal, lay extensive clandestine collaboration between the Israel&apos;s army and secret service and the Palestinian Authority (PA) \u2013 uneasy allies in a shadowy war against common enemies \u2013which has grown still closer in the years since. Madhoun, 32, was a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, part of Yasser Arafat&apos;s Fatah movement still loyal to the idea of armed struggle against Israel and refusing to accept the new Fatah and Palestinian Authority leadership&apos;s strategy of peaceful negotiations. Fawzi Abu al-Qarea, who died in the car with him, was a member of Fatah&apos;s bitter rival Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement. Handwritten notes in Arabic record Israel&apos;s defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, asking the PA interior minister, Nasser Yousef, to assassinate Madhoun. Madhoun&apos;s whereabouts were known to Israel and to Rashid Abu Shabak, a Fatah veteran and head of the PLO&apos;s Preventive Security Organisation in the Gaza Strip, which Israel was preparing to evacuate unilaterally that August. &quot;We know his address ... Why don&apos;t you kill him?&quot; Mofaz asked in a meeting in Tel Aviv earlier that summer. The defence minister alleged Madhoun was planning to attack one of the crossing points from Gaza into Israel. &quot;He is not Hamas and you can kill him.&quot; Yousef, apparently reluctant, replied laconically that &quot;instructions&quot; had been given, but then complained: &quot;The environment is not easy, our capabilities are limited, and you haven&apos;t offered anything.&quot; In the event, Madhoun died at the hands of Israeli forces in retaliation for a suicide bombing carried out by another Palestinian group, Islamic Jihad, which killed five Israelis in an open-air market in the northern town of Hadera on 26 October. Israeli officials told the media that Madhoun was behind an incident in which a Gazan woman was arrested with an explosives belt as she tried to cross into Israel. She allegedly confessed to having been ordered to blow herself up at the Beersheba hospital where she was being treated. Madhoun had also, according to the army, played a role in a suicide bombing that claimed 10 victims in Ashdod in 2004. &quot;Israel had asked the PA several times to arrest him,&quot; Ha&apos;aretz reported, &quot;but in vain.&quot; There is no evidence that the PA played a direct role in Madhoun&apos;s death, but the Mofaz-Yousef meeting and documents from the Palestine papers and WikiLeaks give a revealing insight into the intimate intelligence and security co-operation between the two sides. Strikingly, the head of the Shin Bet security service reported after Madhoun&apos;s killing that his replacement as al-Aqsa leader was heavily influenced by Hamas. The PA, formally committed to fighting violence against Israel, condemned Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups which mounted attacks, but also condemned Israel when it took military action against them. Saeb Erekat, the PLO chief negotiator, compared the Jabaliya drone strike to &quot;pouring fuel on a fire&quot;. The then foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, said of the &quot;targeted assassination&quot; policy: &quot;It is not our goal to continue this activity. It can end immediately. It&apos;s all up to Abu Mazen [PA president, Mahmoud Abbas]. If Abu Mazen takes the strategic decision which he still refuses to take and acts against the infrastructure of terror ... [our activity] in Gaza will end the same day.&quot; Privately, Yuval Diskin, the Shin Bet chief, complained at the end of November 2005 that co-operation with his Palestinian counterparts against Hamas had been &quot;useless&quot; . &quot;We have to do the most to help Fatah,&quot; he said. Nearly a year later, none of the main Palestinian security chiefs, including theveteran security strongman Mohammed Dahlan and Tawfiq Tirawi, head of general intelligence, were capable of providing leadership in Gaza and the West Bank, Israelis officials insisted. Diskin told the US security coordinator, Lieutenant General Keith Dayton, that Tirawi was &quot;motivated, cruel and decisive, but has no standing in Gaza&quot;. He said Dahlan&apos;s Preventative Security Organisation was under pressure from Hamas. &quot;If he sees personal benefit in helping President Abbas, he will do so, because when he wants to, he knows how to pull the strings in Gaza.&quot; Israel&apos;s approach was to urge the PA to arrest or kill wanted people but to act itself if it did not. In one meeting Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defence official, named a suspect and said: &quot;We gave the name to Dahlan and he refused to act. So we took him by force.&quot; PA leaders repeatedly assured both the Israelis and Americans in private that they were committed to fighting terrorism, especially after the Hamas takeover of Gaza in the summer of 2007. The shock of that defeat galvanised US-led efforts to overhaul the PA security apparatus. The aim was to simplify the chain of command to reduce the rivalries of competing agencies and improve performance. By 2008, Israeli leaders were much more confident about co-operation from PA security. &quot;In the West Bank,&quot; Israel&apos;s foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, remarked in March 2008, &quot;the situation is more under control due to the fact that we are there ... and working together&quot;. Hazem Atallah, the PA police chief, boasted that newly trained National Security Force units had fired back when attacked in Qabatya, in the northern West Bank. &quot;That is the way, they have to learn to respect the authority of the Palestinian security forces,&quot; he said. &quot;I understand human rights, but this is not Switzerland.&quot; Amos Gilad responded: &quot;I agree \u2013 freedom is not chaos.&quot; Israel&apos;s chief of staff, General Gabi Ashkenazi, was said to be &quot;no longer sceptical about the utility of co-operation with the PA on security matters&quot;. In September 2009, Erekat, told a US official, David Hale: &quot;We have had to kill Palestinians to establish one authority, one gun and the rule of law. We have even killed our own people to maintain order and the rule of law.&quot; Earlier that year, it had reported privately to George Mitchell the extent of its crackdown on Hamas and others in the West Bank: 3,700 &quot;members of armed groups&quot; had been arrested: 4,700 individuals had been &quot;summoned for questioning&quot; and more than 1,100 weapons had been confiscated.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-25T20:00:04Z", "title": "Israel asked Palestinian Authority to kill al-Aqsa commander", "sentences": ["&quot;We know his address ...

Kurtzer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 1. (S) Summary: Israel suffered three attacks within the span of one hour in an effort to break the calm (&quot;tahdiya&quot;) and derail the impending disengagement, according to Brigadier General Eitan Dangot, Military Secretary to Defense Minister Mofaz, who met with the Ambassador and Acting DATT on July 13. Hizballah fired at the IDF post at Rosh Hanikra, causing no injuries. A PIJ member drove a truck laden with gas canisters into the Shavei Shomron settlement, injuring only himself. A PIJ suicide bomber detonated an explosive charge outside a Netanya mall, killing four and wounding 91 Israelis. As a result the IDF resumed operations against PIJ in the West Bank in efforts to prevent future terror attacks on Israel, as well as to stop the increasing violence prior to the disengagement. As disengagement approaches, Dangot explained, the potential negative impact of successful attacks increases, particularly in its effect on domestic public opinion and support. Dangot provided a summary of the July 12 Security Cabinet meeting, and noted that additional meetings are scheduled to take place this month. The Prime Minister expressed his vision that the disengagement would result in the end of the military occupation of Gaza. The cabinet approved an MoD request to solicit the international community for funding for crossing facilities; and the cabinet agreed that areas evacuated within the northern West Bank would remain classified as &quot;area C&quot; for the near term. End summary. ------------- PIJ CAMPAIGN? ------------- 2. (S) Dangot provided a brief summary of the July 12 attacks. Dangot stated that all three attacks took place within the span of one hour, and were likely linked. PIJ, he stated, is attempting to provoke a strong Israeli response in efforts to destroy the &quot;tahdiya&quot; or calm. On July 12: -- A gunman fired several rounds at the IDF position at Rosh Hanikra. The IDF did not respond, he stated, and no one was injured in the attack. The IDF noted that Hizballah had vacated posts along the southern border with Israel prior to the attack, suggesting the link to Hizballah. -- A Palestinian drove a small pickup truck loaded with gas canisters into the Shavei Shomron settlement. The driver had waited for someone to exit the settlement and drove through the open gate. He detonated the explosive device near the settlement&apos;s kindergarten, which was no longer in session. The Palestinian was severely burned; there were no other casualties. The IDF, Dangot stated, believes that wanted PIJ leader Louis Saadi or his deputy was involved in planning the attack. -- A suicide bomber detonated an explosive charge near a mall in Netanya, killing four Israelis, severely wounding at least six others, and causing a total of 91 to seek medical treatment. PIJ claimed responsibility for the attack. The IDF believes that Tulkarm area PIJ commander Louay Saadi was behind the attack. Saadi, who masterminded the Stage Club attack in Tel Aviv on 25 February, is in hiding. Saadi&apos;s cell operates in the Tulkarm area, including the villages of Atil, Ilar and Saida. 3. (S) Dangot stated that PIJ-sponsored attacks are increasing. In Gaza, the IDF has tracked PIJ connected incidents for the past weeks and has noted a marked increase in mortar, Qassam rocket, explosive charge and shooting attack against Israelis. These attacks, he explained, are not the work of breakaway PIJ cells, but part of a campaign orchestrated by the PIJ headquarters in Damascus. Damascus is pushing the field to conduct attacks against Israel, said Dangot. ----------- PA Inaction ----------- 4. (S) The IDF received a number of indications that Saadi was planning terror attacks, and passed Saadi&apos;s name to the PA several months ago. The GOI requested that PA Minister of Interior Nasir Yusif arrest him. To date, said Dangot, the PA has taken little action against the organization. In Tulkarm, eleven PIJ fugitives declined to sign a declaration ending terror attacks and refused to surrender their weapons to the PA. In response, the PA centralized them in Tulkarm and provided them shelter at night. Moreover, Dangot noted that Mahmud Abbas failed to clearly blame PIJ, during his condemnation of yesterday&apos;s terror attack. ---------------- Time Running Out ---------------- 5. (S) As disengagement approaches, Dangot explained, the potential negative impact of successful attacks increases, particularly in its effect on domestic public opinion and support. Moreover, such attacks decrease Israel&apos;s maneuver space, and make risk-taking in security areas more difficult, as in the case of Bethlehem, with its close proximity to Jerusalem. Finally, the IDF does not want to begin disengagement under the back-drop of increasing violence. 6. (S) During discussions on transferring security responsibility, the IDF warned the PA that it would reenter areas transferred to PA security responsibility if the Palestinians failed to control attacks on Israelis emanating from them. As a result, the GOI decided last night to take action against the PIJ, acting where the PA does not. Early on July 13, the IDF temporarily reentered Tulkarm, and began a series of arrests. During the initial stages of the operation, PA security forces fired on, and lightly wounded, two soldiers. When returning fire, the IDF killed two PA security forces members. ------------------------ Security Cabinet Meeting ------------------------ 7. (S) Dangot provided a summary of the previous day&apos;s Security Cabinet meeting, stating the group would hold two or three more meetings on disengagement issues over the next month. During the July 12 discussions, the Prime Minister explained his vision that disengagement would mean the end of the military occupation in Gaza. Once completed, there would be no symbols of military occupation, including IDF presence on the Philadelphi Strip. 8. (S) The Security Cabinet discussed potential security arrangements concerning the ports ) sea, air, and land ) but no decisions were made. It was clear, Dangot stated, that the IDF would, over time, leave the Philadelphi Strip, following assessment of the effectiveness of the Egyptian border deployment, and the effectiveness of the PA security forces in combating smuggling and cross-border attacks. Dangot stated that Egypt and Israel are still discussing the &quot;responsibility&quot; clause, which is holding up agreement on the deployment of border guards. 9. (S) The Security Cabinet looked also at several options concerning the Rafah crossing ) leave it as is, shift cargo operations to Nitsana, or move to Kerem Shalom. No decisions were made. Dangot stated that the GOI would look at third party supervision of customs and security arrangements, using a staged or incremental approach that would help build mutual confidence and trust. 10. (S) The Prime Minister intends to cancel the military government in Gaza, Dangott said, but needs a task force from Justice, Defense and others to explore new legal rulings on how to proceed with the Palestinians. Concerning the passage issue, the Security Cabinet agreed to an interim solution of using truck convoys between Gaza and the West Bank for door-to-door delivery of cargo in some areas. A similar system, using busses to transport people could also be adopted. Dangot added that details were not examined; a team is needed to study possible long-term solutions such as a train, sunken road, tunnel, etc. 11. (S) MoD Director-General Amos Yaron briefed the Security Cabinet on the 3-4 terminals in Gaza and some 38 crossing points for the West Bank, receiving Cabinet permission to solicit funding, estimated at some 500 million USD initially, from the international community. The cabinet also decided that the Gaza borders would be based on the 1994 map, and would include the territorial exchanges made in 1949-50. 12. (S) Concerning the West Bank, the Security Cabinet decided that there would be no change of status for the four areas containing the evacuated settlements for the time being. These areas would remain classified as &quot;C&quot; zones. However, the GOI would continue to coordinate issues with the PA concerning road construction or other issues. The Ambassador suggested that Israel carefully examine its position on Rafah and the Philadelphi Strip, to ensure that it had an executable exit strategy. 13. (S) Comment: Israel Defense Intelligence assesses that the Damascus PIJ headquarters is behind the Tuesday attacks, but continues to sift through information in search of a &quot;smoking gun.&quot; Dangot was careful to explain that renewed IDF operations would continue in the West Bank, but indicated that operations in the Gaza strip would be restrained in efforts not to fuel a new spiral of violence. Nonetheless, expanded operations against PIJ risk accidental killings of bystanders, which would surely fuel a new round of violence.

He dismissed the extensive concessions offered by Palestinian negotiators, revealed in the documents, saying they were insignificant compared to the &quot;core of the conflict \u2013 our right to exist&quot;. The Palestinians&apos; refusal to recognise Israel as &quot;the nation state of the Jewish people&quot; was preventing a peace settlement, he said.

We&apos;re not ready to start with issues in which we give [ground] and do not get anything.&quot; Ya&apos;alon, a member of Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party and a former military chief of staff, said that without recognition, the Israelis could not &quot;solve the conflict, we have to manage it&quot;. The issue of refugees was central to the question of recognition, said Ya&apos;alon. Palestinians saw the occupation as beginning in 1948 with the birth of the state of Israel, he said, rather than in 1967, and wrongly believed they could return to Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv, Haifa and Acre. &quot;Our position is not even one refugee is going to be settled in Israel.

Further disclosures about negotiations between the two sides are expected this weekend with the serialisation of the former prime minister Ehud Olmert&apos;s memoirs in the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth. In the last year of his premiership, Olmert offered a deal to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, covering borders, Jerusalem and refugees. According to a preview in today&apos;s Yedioth, Olmert says in his memoirs: &quot;Never before had any Israeli prime minister presented such a crystallised and detailed position about resolving the conflict as was presented to him on that day. For the first time since the negotiations began, I was very tense. For the first time since I had become prime minister, I truly felt the weight of Jewish history on my shoulders &quot;Abu Mazen said that he could not decide and that he needed time. I told him that he was making an historic mistake. &apos;Give me the map so that I can consult with my colleagues,&apos; he said to me. &apos;No,&apos; I replied. &apos;Take the pen and sign now. You&apos;ll never get an offer that is more fair or more just. Don&apos;t hesitate. This is hard for me too, but we don&apos;t have an option of not resolving [the conflict].&apos;&quot; The deal was never signed. The Palestinians later claimed that an agreement struck with a lame duck Israeli prime minister would have been worthless. Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, today named an American and a Briton in connection with the leak of the documents. He said the Palestinian Authority wanted to question Clayton Swisher, a former state department official and now a reporter for al-Jazeera, and Alastair Crooke, a former British intelligence officer.

Attempts at defiance have been abundant in the recent history of the Arabs, many of them in Palestine, but unlike those, the Tunisian example was successful: it widened people&apos;s imagination, changed their perception, increased their self-confidence and showed them how fragile their tyrants were. Revolutions travel, and in the Arab world they travel faster: after the first world war, a wave of revolutions swept through the region: Egypt in 1919, Iraq in 1920, Syria in 1925, a guerrilla war in Palestine from 1922-35 and a full-scale popular revolt from 1936-39. After the loss of Palestine to the Zionist movement in 1948, Arab leaders who were perceived to be incompetent and complicit were punished. This time there were political assassinations and military coups: 1949 Lebanon and Syria, 1951 Jordan, 1952 Egypt and 1958 Iraq. More recently, when the Lebanese resistance was able to defeat Israel and force it to withdraw under fire in May 2000, the second Palestinian intifada began a few months later. Despite the difference in performance, Gaza 2008 was a replay of Lebanon 2006. In both wars, Israel killed many civilians but was unable to achieve any of its political goals. But Tunisia was a first in the Arab world, in that it was a non-violent, persistent and eventually successful people&apos;s revolution against a native tyrant allied with the west. The other events were either directed against a colonial power or were military coups, leaving the Arab rulers and their colonial allies with the impression that occupation by proxy was immune to popular anger. It also was a first in that it showed how ordinary people can be quite good in the art of government. Street committees were formed to prevent looting, some cities formed their own governing bodies to fill the vacuum after the fall of the regime \u2013 such bodies were democratic in the rawest sense of the word, legitimate and efficient. Now the wave is coming. I will venture to say that the Egyptian regime has already fallen: it might take some time, but the fear, the perception that the regime is invincible has gone once and for all. All this is followed quite closely in Palestine; any future intifada will not be directed only against the occupation, but also against any Palestinian entity that co-operates with the occupation. Tunisia sent out the message that client regimes fall \u2013 that if we can drive the empires out, we will surely be able to drive out their vassals. As I write, demonstrations rage in the streets of Cairo: everyone knows that if they stay at home, they will be compromising the safety of those in the streets, as well as their own freedom.

Montefiore takes the history of the old city from its beginnings as a fortified village through every conquest or occupation \u2013 Canaanite, Israelite, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, Ummayad, Abassid, Fatimid, Seljuk, Crusader, Saracen, Tatar, Mamluk, Ottoman, British, Jordanian and finally Israeli. Rival places of worship were destroyed and new ones constructed with the stones of earlier buildings, thus making Jerusalem the most complicated archaeological site in the world. Populations were slaughtered or sold into slavery, then later replaced by new waves of immigration. Montefiore&apos;s book, packed with fascinating and often grisly detail, is a gripping account of war, betrayal, looting, rape, massacre, sadistic torture, fanaticism, feuds, persecution, corruption, hypocrisy and\u00a0spirituality. Before going back to the earliest times and King David, Montefiore begins with the sack of Jerusalem and the\u00a0destruction of the Temple in AD70\u00a0by Titus. Jerusalem was packed with refugees and pilgrims for Passover. After his victory, 500 Jews a day were crucified until the Romans ran out of wood. Some survivors were sold into slavery; many others were held back to\u00a0die in the circus, fighting each other or wild animals. Titus&apos;s destruction of Jerusalem did not start the diaspora \u2013 there were large Jewish communities already in Babylon, Parthia, Egypt and Cyprus \u2013 but it certainly focused yearning on the lost city and the destroyed Temple. And not all Jews were banished. Sixty years after Titus, Emperor Hadrian faced another, far better-led Jewish revolt. In fact the Jewish population was to rise and fall over the following centuries, depending on the whims of the conquerors and on outside events, such as the expulsion of the Jews from Spain at the end of the 15th century. With the decision of Emperor Constantine in the fourth century to impose Christianity on both the eastern and western empires, Judaism faced a new challenge. Empress Helena remodelled the ruins of Jerusalem with churches, including that of the Holy Sepulchre. The city became a centre of Christian pilgrimage. No one could have predicted that Constantine&apos;s nephew, Julian the Apostate, would reverse the process. To the astonished joy of the Jews, he set out to rebuild the Temple. But on his death the new emperor, Theodosius, raised Christianity again and banned the Jews from Jerusalem. In the seventh century, Islam, the third monotheistic religion, was also drawn to Jerusalem. Muhammad, who revered the Bible and saw Moses and Jesus as prophets, believed, like Jews and Christians, that Jerusalem would be the site of the Last Judgment, or &quot;the Hour&quot;. The Christians surrendered Jerusalem without a fight, and the Jews especially welcomed the tolerance of their new masters. All admired the celestial beauty of the Dome of the Rock soon dominating the city skyline. Yet for the Jews, its position on the Temple Mount meant that they could not rebuild the Temple of Solomon. The easygoing Umayyad dynasty was replaced in a massacre by the austere Abassids, who lost interest in Jerusalem just at the time when Christian Europe, led by Charlemagne, looked towards the holy city. It was not, however, until the end of the 11th century, following the persecutions of\u00a0Caliph Hakim and the massacre of pilgrims, that Christian kings began to\u00a0think of reconquering Jerusalem. Their timing was fortunate, for the caliphate had been battered by the Seljuk Turkmen and fragmented. In\u00a01099, the first Crusader army took Jerusalem with appalling slaughter. Their knights &quot;rode in blood up to their\u00a0bridles&quot;, recounted an enthusiastic chronicler. The city stank for six months afterwards. The Kingdom of Jerusalem, with fluctuating fortunes, lasted until Guy de Lusignan, the husband of Queen Sibylla, marched out in 1187 towards Galilee led by the True Cross to fight the great Saladin. Thirst and Armenian archers did for his mighty cavalry. Jerusalem soon fell, and those of its population who could not afford a ransom were sold into slavery or the harem. Other crusades followed. In 1228, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen reached the Holy Land and exploited the divisions among Saladin&apos;s descendants. After secret negotiations with the Sultan Kamil, he occupied Jerusalem, but gave the Muslims complete rights over the Temple Mount. His tolerance, enforced by the leader of the Teutonic Knights, Hermann von Salza, was a rare event in Jerusalem&apos;s history. (Bizarrely, Heinrich Himmler later named Waffen-SS formations after both Hohenstaufen and Salza.) But in 1244, Christian Jerusalem fell for the last time until General Allenby&apos;s army defeated the Ottoman Turks in 1917. By the time of the first world war, both Jewish and Arab nationalism had begun to develop. The Jews suffered from rising antisemitism in Russia and western Europe, while the Arabs grew restive under the yoke of the Ottoman empire. The necessities of war in the Middle East encouraged the British to make promises to the Arabs that they had little intention of keeping, while philo-semitism in Lloyd George&apos;s cabinet led to the Balfour Declaration, raising Zionist aspirations. Even before their betrayal by the British at the Versailles conference, the Arabs had become alarmed at the scale of Jewish immigration. Tel Aviv had been founded on the coast in 1909, and two years later came the first kibbutz. Zionists persuaded themselves that Palestinian Arab and Jew could live happily alongside each other. But the secular and socialist idealists of the first waves of immigrants were very different from the hardliners who came later. Lloyd George decided to carve up the Middle East, taking Palestine for Britain while giving Syria to France. The British, especially the urbane governor Sir Ronald Storrs, believed that they could persuade Zionists and Arabs to live together. But in 1920 riots broke out in Jerusalem when 60,000 Arabs protested against the Balfour Declaration. Shooting broke out when a secretly raised Jewish defence force tried to protect the Jewish quarter. A cycle of mutual fear and violence was bound to develop. Arabs stoned Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall. And by 1936, three years after Hitler&apos;s rise to power, there were 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem, with only 60,000 Christians and Muslim Arabs. In 1936, British police cornered and shot down a cell of armed fundamentalist Arabs in the Judaean hills. The Arab revolt began. The grand mufti of Jerusalem backed it, splitting the Arab community, and fled abroad where he\u00a0later sought support from Hitler. Jewish paramilitary groups fought back. Neville Chamberlain reversed the\u00a0Balfour Declaration as the British struggled to control Palestine. With opportunities for a settlement missed, largely through an Arab rejection of a separate Jewish state, the situation became impossible. Zionist paramilitaries fought a vicious guerrilla campaign against British troops, and at\u00a0the end of the war an unstoppable flood of Jewish refugees arrived from European camps. Clement Attlee found that turning to the United States provided little comfort. American Baptists and Evangelicals were strongly pro-Zionist, to say nothing of the increasingly vocal Jewish community. President Truman insisted that another 100,000 Jews should immediately be granted entry. Britain gave up the mandate in despair, and the first Arab-Israeli war immediately ensued. Montefiore&apos;s narrative is remarkably objective when considering his own family&apos;s close links with Jewish Jerusalem. One might quibble with certain details, but overall it is a reliable and compelling account, with many interesting points. Britain&apos;s biblical enthusiasm in the 19th century was soon far surpassed in the US. Since then, messianic Christianity has intensified. American fundamentalist Christians, excited since 1967 that Jerusalem was again Jewish, believe that the &quot;second coming&quot; is now imminent. Some have even been trying to breed an unblemished red heifer for sacrifice according to the prophecy. Now that the peace process appears to have finally collapsed, Montefiore&apos;s book indicates that the Jerusalem syndrome of the comparatively few may well affect us all. Antony Beevor&apos;s books include D-Day: The Battle for Normandy (Penguin).", "publicationDate": "2011-01-29T00:05:00Z", "title": "Jerusalem: The Biography by Simon Sebag Montefiore \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv had been founded on the coast in 1909, and two years later came the first kibbutz."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/29/jerusalem-biography-simon-sebag-montefiore-review"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Linguistics", "Israel"], "article": "If there is one field that has not waited for the global market before dispersing worldwide it must be knowledge. People from all backgrounds have been sharing and disseminating learning for ages. Among their number, one particular category \u2013 translators \u2013 stands out, for without them such exchanges could not happen. In her latest film Nurith Aviv focuses on\u00a0these passionate bridge-builders, men and women who shun the limelight to spread the written word. Aviv was born in Israel and started working as a lead camera operator in 1969. Since 1989 she has devoted all her time to documentaries and in the last 10 years she has concentrated on written and spoken Hebrew, and all it involves beyond the reach of linguistics. The first part of this project, completed in 2004, was Misafa Lesafa: From Language to Language. In it she talked to academics, writers and artists who, as is commonplace in a country with so many immigrants, had plenty to say about being bilingual and belonging to two cultures. This was followed, in 2008, by Langue Sacr\u00e9e, Langue Parl\u00e9e (sacred language, spoken language), which analysed the ambivalence of Hebrew, a modern vernacular reconstructed on the basis of a language that had long been set aside for study of the scriptures. One of the principal merits of the first two parts of this trilogy was to remind us how much language, and consequently its speakers, are coloured by strangeness and open to outside influences: in short, language is both a crucible of meanings and a challenge to purity. Traduire (translate), which rounds off the project, continues this fine endeavour. Aviv talks to various Hebrew translators, modest titans labouring to open up new routes for a language that is historically, theologically and politically loaded. More than 2,000 years after the first attempt (the Septuagint, the Hellenic Greek translation of the Old Testament by Jews in Alexandria), Hebrew translation is still a major challenge. Our admiration for those who engage in this task is all the greater. In Brest, France, Sandrick Le Maguer is working on the Midrash (a Jewish commentary on biblical texts) in an effort to throw new light on the Gospel. In Boston, Massachusetts, Angel Saenz-Badillos is investigating the Iberian sources of medieval poets of the Spanish golden age. In Malakoff, west of Paris, Itskhok Niborski is compiling a dictionary of Hebrew idioms in Yiddish. Meanwhile in Tel Aviv, Sivan Beskin is trying to translate the work of the poet Lea Goldberg (1911-1970), a native of Lithuania, back into her mother tongue. Aviv films these encounters carefully, taking time to listen to each translator in the half-light of their offices, bringing surprisingly passionate ideas to the surface. In Barcelona, Manuel Forcano, who has translated the poet Yehuda Amichai (1924\u20112000) into Catalan, acknowledges that the writer has influenced his own poetry. In Acre, Ala Hlehel, the Palestinian translator of the playwright Hanoch Levin (1943-99), explains how he must &quot;murder the language of the father&quot; to render the concise Hebrew wording into flowery classical Arabic. Traduire, a polyglot exploration of the flesh of language, finds room in its erudite enterprise to explore sensibilities.

In the\u00a0first reel, the world watches with awe as the\u00a0streets of a distant capital fill with the young and the angry, brave enough to shake their fist at a hated dictator. In the second, the statues fall, the tyrant flees and\u00a0all hail a triumph for democracy. But in the final reel there&apos;s a twist: the original street rebels are pushed aside, replaced by a tyranny just as ruthless as the one it toppled \u2013 and much more menacing to its neighbours. That&apos;s the movie famously screened in Tehran in 1979 and which Israelis fear\u00a0they are watching again in Cairo in 2011. One senior Israeli official told me: &quot;You can&apos;t watch the scenes of all these young people demanding their freedom and not get excited.&quot; But at the same time, a\u00a0question keeps nagging: &quot;Where&apos;s this heading?&quot; The answer Israelis dread is a replay of the Iranian revolution. They recall that the Tehran crowds which won western hearts 31 years ago also looked secular and modern \u2013 only to be rapidly displaced by a dictatorship of the ayatollahs. Israel&apos;s Egypt-watchers fret that the country&apos;s secular opposition parties are small, comprised of intellectuals with little grassroots support. Only the Muslim Brotherhood has the resources and organisation to take control. If the current regime topples, they expect the Islamists to take its place. To understand why that prospect chills the blood of Israel&apos;s policymakers, it&apos;s worth recalling a few nuggets of geography and recent history. Egypt looms over Israel from the south, dwarfing it in size and population: 80 million Egyptians outnumber Israelis by\u00a0more than 11 to one. It is the most populous Arab nation and the de facto leader of the Arab world. If Egypt shakes, Israel trembles. Perhaps the key strategic event in Israel&apos;s 63-year history was the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. At a stroke, what had been a battle between Israel and the entire Arab world \u2013 the &quot;Arab-Israeli conflict&quot; \u2013 was reduced to the more manageable dispute between Palestinians and Israelis. For 30\u00a0years, Israel has not had to worry about its southern flank. Just look at Israeli defence spending. When Egypt was still the enemy, defence accounted for nearly 30% of Israeli GDP, driving the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Now it stands at just 8%. So here&apos;s the scenario making Israeli heads throb. Hosni Mubarak leaves, replaced eventually by forces dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood. They hold elections \u2013 but they are of the &quot;one man, one vote, one time&quot; variety. Among the new regime&apos;s first moves is tearing up the Israel treaty \u2013 heeding the demands of those in Tahrir Square reportedly chanting for Mubarak to &quot;go back home to Tel Aviv&quot;. No longer will Egyptian forces police the tunnels that run under the border with Gaza: instead Hamas will be allowed to import as much weaponry as it wants, including from Iran. Nor will Cairo play intermediary between Israel and Hamas (useful until Egypt-Hamas relations all but broke down recently). Suddenly the map will look very different, with Israel facing what one analyst calls Islamist &quot;encirclement: Hezbollah from the north (in Lebanon), Hamas from the west (in Gaza) and the\u00a0Muslim Brotherhood from the south\u00a0(in Sinai).&quot; If that scenario doesn&apos;t sound gloomy enough, Israel will have lost something even deeper. Beyond all the talk of borders and buffer zones, what Israel craves is recognition of its legitimacy \u2013 starting with acceptance of its existence. The 1979 treaty provided that, signalling an acknowledgement \u2013 grudging, maybe; cold, perhaps \u2013 that Israel was in the Middle East to stay. If Egypt were to annul that accord, the strategic bedrock of Israeli security and its sense of itself in the region will have been pulled away. This is what the Israeli official who spoke to me of a &quot;game-changer&quot; has in mind. Suddenly, Jordan would stand alone as the sole Arab state that formally recognises Israel \u2013 and judging by King Abdullah&apos;s hasty sacking of his prime minister today under popular pressure, that hardly seems a reliable foundation. Lacking the cover once provided by Egypt, the Palestinian Authority would be increasingly isolated in its policy of dialogue with Israel. Small wonder then that Israel&apos;s preachers of realpolitik are left concluding that democracy is fine in theory, but\u00a0not, when it comes to the Arab world, in practice. As former foreign minister Moshe Arens puts it: &quot;Peace you make with dictators.&quot; Only a tyrant, he argues, can deliver the two essentials of any peace deal with Israel: a promise to terminate the conflict and a guarantee of security, with no armed attacks from his territory. If Arens is right, then Israel is left hoping either for Mubarak to stay on or, at most, for his strongman-in-waiting, Omar Suleiman, to take over. But that is\u00a0not just bleak in principle \u2013 putting Israel on the wrong side of a democratic wave it should welcome \u2013 it doesn&apos;t make pragmatic sense. For surely the events of recent days, in Tunisia, Jordan, Yemen as well as Egypt, have shown that no dictatorship is truly sustainable, not for ever. And if those regimes can&apos;t last, then nor can any peace made with them. Sure, the peace accord with Anwar Sadat and then Mubarak brought great benefits \u2013 but how much bigger a prize would be an Israeli peace with the Egyptian people, one underpinned by their genuine consent? That, and that alone, would be a treaty to last. The cynics will dismiss such talk as naive and Pollyanna-ish, the stuff of leftist daydreams. But it was the former Soviet dissident turned Israeli politician \u2013 and no leftist \u2013 Natan Sharansky, who long argued that peace depended on an Arab shift to democracy. Or listen to the former deputy chief of\u00a0mission in Israel&apos;s Cairo embassy, Ruth Wasserman Lande. She agrees that Israel is right to be concerned by the upheaval in Egypt, that it should remain vigilant, &quot;with seven eyes in the back of\u00a0its head&quot;. But she also urges Israelis to listen to the protesters with &quot;open eyes and an open heart&quot;. Doom is not inevitable. She notes the historic rejection by the Egyptian public of Islamist violence, a trend that dates back to the 1920s. Even now, jihadists who have mounted attacks on foreign tourists have won little popular support. She recalls the joint Israeli-Egyptian Qualified Industrial Zones established in 2005. They provoked protests \u2013 not by Egyptians angry at collusion with the enemy, but by jobless Egyptians furious at being excluded from the scheme. Show Egyptians that peace with Israel brings tangible benefits and they&apos;ll support it. Is Lande naive? &quot;I lived alone in Cairo for three years as a Jew and a woman and an Israeli diplomat. It&apos;s hard for me to be naive about Egypt.&quot; For now, as Israelis watch their neighbour, fear is outstripping hope. But another reaction is possible. It would acknowledge that peace with Arab rulers alone could never last, that one day Israel will have to make peace with the peoples it lives among. That day may not be coming soon \u2013 but that truth just got a whole lot harder to avoid.", "publicationDate": "2011-02-01T20:30:00Z", "title": "When Egypt shakes, it should be no surprise that Israel trembles | Jonathan Freedland", "sentences": ["Among the new regime&apos;s first moves is tearing up the Israel treaty \u2013 heeding the demands of those in Tahrir Square reportedly chanting for Mubarak to &quot;go back home to Tel Aviv&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/01/egypt-israel-democracy-arab-world-peace"}, {"tags": ["Installation", "Art", "Art and design", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "Keren Cytter creates short DIY films at a breakneck speed. Using only what she has to hand, the young Berlin-based Israeli writes, shoots and edits each project herself, sometimes in a matter of weeks, casting friends in starring roles and using their apartments and local neighbourhood for sets. She&apos;s shown her films at major art spaces everywhere from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles but, long before they get installed in galleries, her films are swiftly posted on YouTube. While the look is pure home movie, Cytter&apos;s work is anything but unthoughtful. Authors such as Samuel Beckett or Julio Cort\u00e1zar influence some of her stories, featuring amateur actors deadpanning their way through intricate, poetic scripts. Frequently, however, her plots hinge on the stuff of soap opera and classic French film: love, sex and relationships. Cytter&apos;s latest work, Avalanche, is structured around concepts relating to the conscious and unconscious mind, and illustrates just how elaborate her homespun films can be. This four-part piece begins as a simple camera demo video, but as the cameraman shows us what the lens can do, different dramas are brought into focus and mixed together. There&apos;s a love triangle where a wannabe film star and her amours discuss Russian literature and Lonely Planet, arguing and flirting as they walk along. Anxiety dominates. Later, a guy wearing a giant disco ball recalls humiliating childhood piano lessons; his trauma is revoiced by a group in a restaurant. Why we like her: Screened as a short film, Cytter&apos;s The Coat is a murder story of sorts involving a beautiful woman and two sudoku-obsessed brothers. This relatively simple premise delivers a dreamland of fragmented encounters, with visual tricks including split screens, floating numbers and kaleidoscopic effects. Pen-pusher: When Cytter&apos;s not making films, she writes. Her four novels include Yesterday&apos;s Sunset and the brilliantly titled The Man Who Climbed the Stairs of Life and Found Out That They Were Cinema Seats.

The departures board says our flight to Cairo is cancelled. The woman at the ticket office is unsympathetic; she thinks we are insane to be trying to get to Cairo.The only other option is an El Al flight at 8pm. We&apos;re told this one will depart as every seat on the return leg tonight is booked by Israelis desperate to get out of Egypt. We settle down for an 11-hour wait. At the boarding gate, it&apos;s clear that there are only around a dozen people on the outward leg to Cairo \u2013 all journalists bar one, an EU official going to assess the situation in Cairo for staff based there. We land around 10.30pm and are told by a cheery airport official that there will be no problem getting into the city centre tonight, everything is &quot;normal&quot;. A cruel joke? The curfew means no taxis will take us downtown or indeed anywhere. We persuade a shuttle bus driver to drop us at an airport hotel. In the lobby, there are chaotic scenes: luggage piled up, people either milling about aimlessly or sleeping on every available chair and floor space. We decide to try the next-door hotel. The scene here is similar but not quite as bad; there are no rooms available, but the doorman says he might be able to find rooms at another hotel in half an hour. We go to the bar. An hour later, we cut our losses and find a corner of the lobby. But before we can lay down on the carpet to try to sleep, a group of stranded Brits want to tell us every detail of their abortive holiday. It is an extraordinary tale, but I am swaying on my feet, desperate to shut my eyes.  Monday January 31 We wake up early, having slept fitfully. The curfew lifts at 8am, no chance of any transport until then. Eventually we get one taxi back to the airport terminal, then another into the centre of Cairo. The road is punctuated by army tanks and armoured personnel carriers. I wonder why the vehicles are painted yellow instead of the standard green until I try to find a more accurate description of the colour. Sand yellow. Ah yes, that&apos;s why. There is almost no traffic on the roads: the journey from the airport takes around 40 minutes, in contrast to a more standard two hours according to one of my fellow passengers. Smog lies over the city. It is my first visit to Cairo.  I check into the Marriott although the rest of the Guardian team are in another hotel, closer to Tahrir Square. I take a cab over there \u2013 a stupid mistake as what is a 15 minute walk becomes a 45 minute car ride as the driver takes a circuitous route to avoid roadblocks and vigilantes. Peter Beaumont and Jack Shenker are there, on the 19th floor in a room that looks a bit like a war zone itself. They give me a debrief on the latest situation and some useful phone numbers; then they are off to report stories. I head to Tahrir Square. It&apos;s an amazing spectacle \u2013 thousands of people gathering with home-made signs and one message: Mubarak must go. The protesters are good-humoured and relaxed; everyone is keen to speak to a western reporter. I feel fine about wandering around on my own, tweeting, doing phone interviews with Matt Weaver, our live blogger in London, and filling my notebook. People are eloquent about the reasons for their uprising. Many speak of economic hardship, lack of democracy, the desire for freedom. One of the most memorable comments in a day, a week, of memorable conversations comes from a guy who tells me he has come &quot;to fight the fear inside me&quot;. The curfew starts at 3pm but no one takes any notice \u2013 in fact more and more people are coming into the square. There is no military or police presence in the square itself, and the soldiers a block back are friendly. Eventually I head back to file a piece. There is no internet of course, so the choice is dictating my copy down the phone or faxing it over to the office. I choose the former. This is what it was like before the internet. It&apos;s not just getting the copy to London \u2013 I can&apos;t find anything out. &quot;Now I&apos;m here, you know a million times more than me what&apos;s happening,&quot; I joke to Dave Munk, deputy foreign editor. Except I&apos;m not joking. Tuesday February 1     Alexandria protests turn violent as anti-government demonstrators clash with Mubrark supporters. Photograph: AP    I decide to leave for Alexandria, Egypt&apos;s second biggest city, and the scene of some of the worst violence the previous Friday. I find a driver willing to take me \u2013 it&apos;s not clear whether the roads are open, although I am in touch with Channel 4&apos;s Lindsey Hilsum who made the journey the previous day without hitch. I call the hotel where Lindsey and other journalists are staying. &quot;Are you a reporter?&quot; the guy on reception asks. When I say yes, he refuses me a room, saying there has been trouble at the hotel over journalists staying there. I make a reservation elsewhere. The three-hour trip is uneventful, though there are army checkpoints and roadblocks on the way into Alex. I check into my eerily locked and deserted hotel and head out immediately, despite the hotel security guys trying to stop me. Today is the &quot;million man march&quot; day and I&apos;m not going to watch from my hotel balcony. The area around the Ibrahim mosque fills up quickly. It&apos;s a carnival atmosphere, people are cheerful and happy to talk \u2013 this is easy reporting. There are incredible sights and sounds: people praying on the pavement; a man in army fatigues being carried shoulder-high through the cheering crowd; tens of thousands of people singing the national anthem. Then the crowd moves off, and I go with it. No one seems to know the destination. All the side streets are guarded by citizen-vigilantes bearing sticks, iron bars and even knives. There was a lot of looting and violence last week. Eventually I peel off, needing to go back to the hotel to write a story. It&apos;s about 5pm and getting dark, and I realise the only way back is to walk. Despite - or because of - the citizen-vigilantes, it&apos;s not frightening; at least, not until I realise I&apos;m lost in a city under curfew. I try to flag down the occasional passing taxi but they are all completely full. At the next citizen-checkpoint, I ask for directions. It&apos;s not safe for you to be on the streets, they say, we will find someone to take to your hotel. They are stopping all cars anyway to check the occupants. When they find one with a spare seat, they tell the driver to take me. Later someone asked me if it had been wise to get into a car with an unknown person in a city on the brink of revolution. I didn&apos;t really have much choice. Wednesday February 2     More clashes in Alexandria: Reuters    I need to change hotels; I want to be with other journalists. I go to the hotel I tried to get into 24 hours previously and they give me a room, but plead with me to be discreet and not take pictures or use recording equipment in or near the hotel. Time for the streets again. I go the mosque, and immediately it feels different. There were reports overnight of violence in Alex; 12 people have been injured in clashes I&apos;m told. Today there is a smaller number of anti-regime protesters, but there is a fightback by Mubarak supporters. Furious arguments, complete with finger-jabbing and shoving, break out everywhere; the mood is ugly. Anti-regime protesters repeatedly tell me that the pro-Mubarak people are paid agents of the state. Then people begin to question me \u2013 who am I? Where am I from? What news organisation do I represent? Every time I try to interview someone, an angry crowd forms around me. Ramy, a tall and friendly student, appoints himself my protector but nevertheless I feel the need to move out of the thick crowd. This is not like the previous days; I begin to feel uncomfortable about being alone. Confrontations between supporters and opponents of the regime continue through the day; and although the threat of violence is palpable, it never seems to be quite realised. It&apos;s only later, back at the hotel, that I learn the full extent of the street battles and bloodshed in Cairo. The internet comes back to life later in the evening. I want to kiss my laptop screen. Thursday February 4 I&apos;m keen to try to get back to Cairo \u2013 that&apos;s where the main action is and I&apos;d rather be with the Guardian team there. But I have no idea whether the roads are open, and my editors want me to stay; it&apos;s good to have a perspective from outside the capital, they say, and we have enough people in Cairo. I hook up with a local fixer and we head off to speak to people for a piece my editors have asked for on the mood among students, traditionally the forefront of any uprising. All the universities in Alex have been closed \u2013 locked and guarded \u2013 for more than a week, so we go first to coffee shops in quiet back streets. It&apos;s a mixed picture; away from the protests, most of the students I speak to are worried and frightened and to varying degrees feel it&apos;s time to scale back or halt the protests. All say their economic prospects are dim and this is the reason for the protests. But in the square in front of the mosque, students are adamant they must keep going until Mubarak is toppled. It&apos;s even harder today to speak to anyone without being surrounded by angry people. They are now saying journalists are Israeli spies, and that my fixer is also a Zionist. I am shoved in the shoulder by a man yelling in my face. My fixer tells me the Egyptian state TV has told viewers to beware of Israeli spies masquerading as western journalists. I become acutely conscious that I have an Israeli work permit in my passport, and business cards identifying me as the Guardian&apos;s Jerusalem correspondent. This is not good \u2013 we retreat to the hotel. There we meet up with the Channel 4 team again, who have just had a very threatening situation in a residential street. They feel the hotel is now a target \u2013 it has been mobbed by protesters several times, looking for western journalists. Two NPR reporters were surrounded on the street by an angry crowd who then followed them back to the hotel. The security guys are getting very, very twitchy. The Channel 4 team are decamping to an apartment which they are using as their bureau. They invite me to go with them, and I gratefully accept. But the apartment&apos;s owner vetoes this plan. He knows his property could also become a target. Reports filter through from Cairo of journalists being intimidated, detained and beaten up. I call my editors for advice; they feel it&apos;s time to get out and book me on a flight from Alex to Amman the following day. Friday February 4 The &quot;Day of Departure&quot; turns out to be mine, not Mubarak&apos;s. I meet two Danish TV guys in the hotel lobby. They arrived in Alex the previous evening. Coming into the city, their car was surrounded by 60-70 people brandishing knives and sticks and trying to drag them out of the car. They got away, but are very shaken up and have also decided to leave. We go to the airport together. My trip home \u2013 Alex to Amman, then Amman to Tel Aviv \u2013 takes 10 hours despite being in the air for only around 120 minutes. I feel very ambivalent about leaving. It had become almost impossible to do any proper reporting and in any case the focus, rightly, was on Cairo. But I now have a huge attachment to the story, and I keep thinking about the extraordinary people I met and the amazing things I saw, both in Cairo and Alexandria. It&apos;s hard to know how this is going to pan out, but it&apos;s impossible to be indifferent.\u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 12 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-02-06T08:44:00Z", "title": "Egypt notebook", "sentences": ["My trip home \u2013 Alex to Amman, then Amman to Tel Aviv \u2013 takes 10 hours despite being in the air for only around 120 minutes."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/feb/06/egypt"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Middle East peace talks", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "A former Israeli soldier is facing a long prison sentence after admitting that she passed thousands of classified military documents to a newspaper reporter. Anat Kam, 24, has been under house arrest since she was charged in January 2010 with espionage and intent to harm state security with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In a plea bargain, that charge was dropped when she admitted to collecting and passing on secret information. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors are reportedly asking for about nine years. Among the documents leaked by Kam to the Haaretz reporter Uri Blau were papers showing that Israeli military and security officials had authorised the killing of Palestinian militants in operations where they could have instead been arrested. Kam made copies of 2,000 documents, including 700 marked top secret, during her national service as a clerk in the office of a top Israeli general. Blau published an investigation revealing the content of the documents in November 2008. The assassinations contravened an Israeli high court judgment which ruled that militants must be arrested where possible. Blau&apos;s article was approved by the military censor, and Kam was not arrested for more than a year after publication. The Haaretz journalist remained in London, where he was at the time of Kam&apos;s arrest, for many months, fearing he would face prosecution if he returned to Israel. He flew back in October after his lawyers struck a deal with the Shin Bet security service under which he returned the documents. After Kam&apos;s arrest, the Israeli authorities imposed a gagging order on the reporting of the case, which was lifted last April. Kam admitted the lesser charge of possession and distribution of classified information at Tel Aviv district court.

Ferguson has negotiated an agreement with the Serbian football association so that the club captain, Nemanja Vidic, is not involved in the game against Israel in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and can concentrate on facing Carlos Tevez at Old Trafford. Ferdinand has been ruled out because of the calf injury he suffered in the warm-up before the 2-1 defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday and Jonny Evans has become the latest United player to withdraw from international duty. He cited a sore ankle for not taking any part in Northern Ireland&apos;s friendly against Scotland. Chris Smalling had already withdrawn from the England Under-21 game against Italy because of an unspecified injury described only as a &quot;knock&quot;. As it stands, that means Vidic is the only fit centre-half at the club apart from Wes Brown, who is now effectively fifth choice and considered leaving Old Trafford in the January transfer window. However, it is understood the withdrawals are based on precautionary reasons, United taking a better-safe-than-sorry policy ahead of a match that could go a long way to determining whether they win a record 19th championship. Ferguson has said Ferdinand will miss two to three weeks and was concerned about the possibility of losing Smalling or Evans in a round of friendlies that represents a source of extreme irritation for the United manager at this stage of the season. As well as issues involving his defence, Ferguson also has misgivings about whether Javier Hern\u00e1ndez will be able to take part against Roberto Mancini&apos;s team. The Mexican is in Atlanta to play in a friendly against Bosnia, which kicks off at 1am English time on Thursday, and his plane back to Manchester does not arrive until 9am on Friday. The concern at Old Trafford is that a long flight directly after a match, the jet lag and stiffening up of joints might mean the striker is not in a suitable condition to play in a Saturday lunchtime game. City do not have the same problem because Bosnia agreed to allow the club&apos;s new \u00a327m signing, Edin Dzeko, a week to prepare for the derby rather than take a tiring round trip to the United States. Similarly, Argentina have not included Tevez in their get-together in Geneva for a game against Portugal.

Unfortunately, the foreign secretary is appealing against every instinct in the Israeli body politic, which is to dig in deeper in the face of uncertainty on its southern flank. At the Munich security conference, the Israeli national security advisor, Uzi Arad, warned an audience of western officials and diplomats that the Muslim Brotherhood was better organised than Egypt&apos;s secular opposition groups and was, therefore, likely to come out on top in a post-Mubarak world. The &quot;belligerent&quot; language that Hague is talking about refers to Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s vow to &quot;reinforce the might of the state of Israel&quot;, which means reorienting the Israeli Defence Force so that it once again faces south after three decades of peace. The regional uncertainty is also being used by the Netanyahu government as a reason not to give ground on the substantial issues blocking progress on peace with the Palestinians, such as the continuing growth of West Bank settlements. However, Israel showed little inclination to stop building even when the region was relatively tranquil. It abandoned its moratorium on settlement-building last September, when there was no sign of any challenge to Hosni Murabak&apos;s reign. Writing in Foreign Policy earlier this month, Daniel Levy, of the New America Foundation, described the president as a &quot;key facilitator of Israel&apos;s agenda in the region \u2013 partly due to his support for the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty but primarily centred around his maintenance of a &apos;go-nowhere&apos; peace process that helps shield Israel from international criticism while giving Egypt the appearance of being a useful ally to the US.&quot; Mubarak, Levy argued, also made himself useful by helping to isolate Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas and &quot;playing host to the occasional peace gala in order to maintain the fiction that all of this &apos;peace processing&apos; might lead somewhere&quot;. The truth was that it was going nowhere since the end of the moratorium on settlements and Washington&apos;s acquiescence in that Israeli move. It is Hague&apos;s expression of frustration with the Obama administration, however diplomatically phrased, that is perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of his interviews on Wednesday. It reflects a widespread belief in Europe that Washington has dropped the ball on the peace process. By default, leadership has switched to the Quartet (the EU, UN, US and Russia), which will meet Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in the next few weeks. The trouble is that, in Israeli eyes, the Quartet dilutes US pressure rather than amplifies it. The foreign secretary&apos;s intervention is unlikely to change any of this, but it comes at a time when he is personally under attack at home for what his critics say is a lack of clarity in the coalition&apos;s foreign policy. The headline writers are giving in to the inevitable temptation of rhyming Hague with vague. A recent column in the Times complained: &quot;We should not exaggerate the importance of the British intervention but our view would matter, if only we had one.&quot; They might not go down well in Tel Aviv and Washington, but Hague&apos;s remarks do at least represent a distinct British view.", "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T15:47:00Z", "title": "William Hague's call to revive Middle East peace process faces obduracy", "sentences": ["A recent column in the Times complained: &quot;We should not exaggerate the importance of the British intervention but our view would matter, if only we had one.&quot; They might not go down well in Tel Aviv and Washington, but Hague&apos;s remarks do at least represent a distinct British view."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/09/william-hague-middle-east-peace-process"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US foreign policy"], "article": "Hosni Mubarak&apos;s dramatic departure marks the end of an era for Egypt and the Middle East. Thirty years of his rule has left a deep impression on his country&apos;s domestic affairs and external relations. Without him, much could change on many fronts \u2014 at home and across the region. Egyptian politics, like all politics, are local, and what happens next depends crucially on the readiness of the military establishment to oversee what Barack Obama has called a genuine transition to democracy, in line with the thunderous demands of the now triumphant protestors massed in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square. It was always likely that the army, the most powerful player in Egyptian politics since the 1952 revolution, would step in as the guardian of stability. The US, Israel and most other Arab regimes will most likely welcome that, keeping their qualms to themselves. So, for the moment, will many ordinary Egyptians \u2013 but only if it is the prelude to far-reaching change. Rule by the military can only be temporary. Mubarak&apos;s exit, the dissolution of what is seen as an illegitimate parliament, constitutional reforms and abolition of the emergency laws are all non-negotiable. If those reforms are achieved, then Egypt will have witnessed a real revolution \u2013 beyond the removal of a stubborn 82-year-old president long past his sell-by date. It seems clear from the events of recent days \u2013 especially the confusion and contradictory messages on Thursday \u2014 that the army is divided. If it moves solely to protect its own privileged position, and that of the big businessmen who have done so well out of their links with the regime \u2013 then the system will not open up, at least not without large-scale repression and bloodshed. Mubarak&apos;s replacement by the armed forces will mean a resumption of the talks that began earlier this week on constitutional and other changes, though they were pronounced dead almost before they began. With good will it should be possible to amend or rewrite the constitution to allow the election of a new parliament and president. It could, however, all still take months to agree, risking impatience in the streets and new unrest. Egypt&apos;s extraordinary change matters first for Egypt&apos;s 82 million people. But what happens in the Arab world&apos;s most populous country matters for many millions of other Arabs, who also suffer from unemployment, inequality, corruption and unresponsive, unaccountable governments \u2013 and share the language in which it is being covered in media such as al-Jazeera and social networking sites that official censors cannot easily block. Other authoritarian regimes, shocked first by the uprising in Tunisia and now in Egypt, have been trying to pre-empt trouble by promises of reform, sacking ministers, maintaining subsidies or raising wages to buy off critics and defuse tensions. The symptoms are visible from Yemen to Jordan, from Algeria to Syria. Egypt&apos;s political future also matters enormously to the US \u2013 thus the importance of the policy pronouncements from Washington since the crisis began, shown again by Obama&apos;s renewed call on for an &quot;orderly and genuine transition&quot; to the post-Mubarak era. In the 1960s and 1970s, Egypt was a Soviet client, but it changed sides in 1979 by signing a taboo-breaking peace treaty with Israel, after four wars that cost it thousands of lives. First under Anwar Sadat, and then under Mubarak, the relationship with the US blossomed to one of high-level strategic co-operation, so much so that Egyptian forces took part in the liberation of Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion in 1990. Egypt remains a vital asset in allowing US military overflights, as the guardian of the strategically vital Suez canal, and a loyal ally in the regional confrontation with Iran. Mubarak has played a key role in supporting the western-backed Palestinian Authority and containing the Islamist movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, not least because of its affinity with the banned Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 whose likely future role in a freer Egyptian political system is a key and much-discussed issue both at home and abroad. The events of the last 18 days have forced Obama to shift away from stability to embracing if not promoting democracy \u2013 to the evident discomfort of other conservative Arab friends, especially the Saudis. Jordan and Yemen share those concerns \u2013 fearing that unconditional US support for them may now also wane. Israel has also let it be known in no uncertain terms that it prefers stability as the best guarantor of the peace treaty and as a barrier to Isalmist power and hinted that an Iranian-type revolution may be unfolding on the banks of the Nile. But any realistic appraisal would conclude that the Egyptian military and security establishment as currently constituted has no interest in undermining its strategic relationships with either Washington or Tel Aviv \u2013 the latter in particular deeply unpopular with the mass of Egyptians.

The film had been due for a handful of low-key screenings until someone stole it from the director&apos;s office 10 days ago and suddenly everybody wanted to see it. In fairness, it was always an interesting proposition. With a budget of just \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3336,000), the director, Cyril Tuschi, claimed to have secured something no media organisation in the world had managed: an on-camera interview conducted through the bars of the dock during Khodorkovsky&apos;s second trial in Moscow last year. Oddly, the interview itself is one of the less gripping scenes in the 113-minute documentary. It is remarkable only for the chipper attitude of the prisoner, who laughs at the charges against him \u2013 where on earth could he have hidden the 2bn barrels of oil he was alleged to have stolen, he asks Tuschi. A more compelling interviewee is Dmitry Gololbov, former deputy head of the legal department of Khodorkovsky&apos;s oil firm Yukos. He seems furious with his former boss. &quot;I spit on him,&quot; he says, suggesting Khodorkovsky effectively wrote his own sentence. &quot;He was one of the oligarchs who created the whole judicial system he is in right now.&quot; Christian Michel, who advised Khodorkovsky in the early years of his wealth creation, even suggests the oligarch, eyeing a political career in opposition to Putin, wanted to go to jail &quot;to redeem himself&quot; in the eyes of the Russian people. It would be in his character, said Michel, to &quot;play this sort of gambit \u2013 to sacrifice his queen in order to win the end game&quot;. Tuschi takes a tour of the compound where the Yukos executives used to live just outside Moscow, walled in from the outside world. What he discovers, years after Khodorkovsky was sent to Siberia and his executives fled abroad, suggests that all believe they will be back there before long. Despite the 50-space garage lying empty, the grounds are kept spick and span and the concierge reveals he regularly buys new tins of food for the bunker hidden under the complex. Despite his claim of objectivity, Tuschi speaks to more of Khodorkovsky&apos;s friends than foes. Those on his side include his mother, Marina, his ex-wife, and his eldest son, Pavel, who lives in exile in the US \u2013 as well as ex-Yukos highfliers Leonid Nevzlin and Mikhail Brudno, both now hiding from Interpol in Tel Aviv. It&apos;s therefore no surprise that most people will leave the cinema thinking the baddie of the piece is not the man who plundered Russia&apos;s resources for his own personal gain, but villainous old Vladimir Putin. Unsurprisingly, the Russian prime minister declined to be interviewed. But he crops up in newsreel footage throughout the film, including a famous televised press meeting he held with Russia&apos;s richest men in February 2003, when Khodorkovsky, already flirting with opposition politics, brings up the topic of corruption. The look Putin gives him! It&apos;s a death stare that says: you, my friend, will soon be sleeping with the carp at the bottom of the Volga (or failing that, a gulag six time zones away from Moscow). \u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2011 to remove a repeated reference to Khodorkovsky&apos;s mother. The original also said that the film had been due for a single screening in a remote east Berlin cinema.

MANAMA 660 B. MANAMA 628 C. MANAMA 651Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (C) Jeff, you will arrive in Bahrain at a time of introspection for the Bahraini regime as this year&apos;s IISS Manama Dialogue coincides with the tenth anniversary of King Hamad&apos;s accession to the throne, on December 17, 1999. During those ten years, the political and security situation has improved considerably. Our challenge is to help the Bahrainis keep things moving in the right direction, a task made considerably easier by a forward-looking and sympathetic leadership. --------------------------- TEN YEARS OF TRANSFORMATION --------------------------- 2. (C) Following the death of his father, Emir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa in 1999, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa inherited a country torn by sectarian violence and accustomed to dealing with the Shia majority 5nderclass as a policing problem. He quickly embarked on a program of reform and reconciliation with Bahrain&apos;s Shia: he allowed exiles to return home, abolished the State Security Courts, and restored the parliament suspended since 1975. King Hamad understands that political stability is also tied to economic prosperity, and has undertaken far-reaching economic reforms intended to increase Bahrain&apos;s competitiveness, productivity and living standards. The result is that the Bahrain of today is a far cry from the Bahrain of the 1990s. Political parties operate freely and are preparing for a third parliamentary election cycle in 2010 (ref A). Street protests are significantly fewer and less violent. Perhaps most tellingly, the leader of the mainstream Shia Wifaq party has told us unequivocally that Wifaq will continue to engage in parliamentary politics because he believes there is more to gain in the long run by participating than by boycotting. ------------------------------------ REGIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY ------------------------------------ 3. (C) A graduate of the Mons Officer Cadet School and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, King Hamad takes a leading role in directing Bahrain&apos;s security policy, and carries the title of Supreme Commander. During his three decades as Crown Prince, he personally built the Bahrain Defense Force from the ground up, relying heavily on U.S. equipment and training. King Hamad believes that the peace and prosperity of the Gulf is a result of U.S. protection and friendship. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain and two U.S. Patriot batteries are also stationed here. Bahrain&apos;s leaders are thus strong and outspoken proponents of a close and enduring security relationship between the United States and the region. 4. (C) Bahrain was designated a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2002, and King Hamad believes it is important that Bahrain do its part in support of regional security. In March 2008, Bahrain became the first Arab country to take command of CTF-152, one of the coalition&apos;s naval task forces in the Persian Gulf. They have also deployed as part of the CTF-151 anti-piracy mission in the Arabian Sea. On December 16, King Hamad will personally see off a company of Bahraini Special Security Forces, who will be departing to serve as part of coalition operations in Afghanistan. This activism marks Bahrain as a leader among GCC states and has encouraged others such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia to become more involved. 5. (C) King Hamad views an activist foreign policy as essential for a small state like Bahrain that wants its interests to be considered in the region. He chose the forward-leaning Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa as his foreign minister. In June, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa penned a Washington Post op-ed in which he called on Arab leaders to engage with the Israeli people in support of the Arab Peace Initiative. Shortly thereafter, Bahraini officials traveled to Tel Aviv to bring back several Bahrainis who had been aboard a relief ship that was taken into Israeli custody when it tried to enter Gaza. Even modest steps in the direction of Israel set off criticism from local media and from members of parliament decrying &quot;normalization.&quot; Recently, MPs in the elected (and Islamist-dominated) lower house voted to criminalize any contact with Israel or Israeli citizens (ref B) even though most recognized that the (appointed) upper house will ensure the bill never becomes law. 6. (C) Bahrain was one of the first Gulf states to reopen its embassy in Baghdad, and, while wary of the Maliki government, has reached out to Iraq politically and economically. Bahraini airlines now fly regularly to several Iraqi cities. The King has established a relationship with Sayyid Ammar Al Hakim, chairman of the Supreme Islamic Council in Iraq. During Hakim&apos;s recent visit to Bahrain (ref C), King Hamad asked for his support in channeling the energies of Bahraini Shia in a positive direction, and told Hakim that he would do what he could to get the Saudis to engage with Iraq. Bahrain maintains correct relations with Iran, but has no illusions about the threat it poses to the region. Bahrain quietly supports international pressure on Iran, and consulting with the leadership will ensure that we maintain that support. ---------------- POLITICAL VISION ---------------- 7. (C) King Hamad understands that Bahrain cannot prosper if he rules by repression. Bahrain&apos;s civil society is active and is engaged with Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) programming. There is more religious freedom in Bahrain than in most neighboring countries; Sunni and Shia mosques stand alongside Christian churches and Hindu temples. The National Charter (e.g., constitution) won approval in a 2000 referendum and restored the parliament that had been suspended in 1975. Two election cycles have seen the integration of the Shia opposition into the political process. While a Shia rejectionist fringe continues to boycott the process, their influence remains limited as the mainstream Wifaq party has shown an ability to work with the government to achieve results for its constituents. Discrimination against Shia persists, however, and the government has sought to deflect criticism by engaging with Wifaq and focusing more public spending on housing and social welfare projects. So long as Wifaq remains convinced of the benefits of political participation, the long-term outlook for Bahrain&apos;s stability is good. ------------------------ COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ------------------------ 8. (S) The 2004 withdrawal of U.S. Navy dependents represented the nadir in our counterterrorism relationship. Since then, the government has enacted a tough, new CT law and has used it to obtain several convictions against Al Qaeda financiers and facilitators. Much of that success is connected to the King&apos;s installation of new, more capable leadership at both the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Bahrain National Security Agency (BNSA) in 2006 and 2008, respectively. BNSA routinely shares high-quality intel and seeks out joint operations opportunities. MOI has proven itself highly capable of maintaining internal security. The U.S. is contributing to the CT mission through the provision of a coastal radar system via Section 1206 funding that will give Bahrain (and the U.S. Navy) a 360 degree field of vision around the island. --------------- ECONOMIC VISION --------------- 9. (C) Unlike its neighbors, Bahrain is not blessed with abundant oil and gas, and so has diversified its economy, establishing itself as the world&apos;s leading center for Islamic banking and finance. This sector generates just over one quarter of domestic GDP. Bahrain also boasts a strong regional tourism sector that accounts for a significant portion of GDP. The country produces approximately 35,000 barrels/day of oil, which is all refined locally, and 1.2 billion standard cubic feet/day of gas, which is all consumed domestically. In order to maintain economic growth, Bahrain must find additional sources of energy. The government has sought cheap gas from both Saudi Arabia and Qatar to no avail, and is currently engaged in slow-rolling talks with Iran. Contacts have asserted that discussions with Iran are aimed at getting the Saudis and Qataris off the dime. 10. (C) Bahrain has also expressed long-term interest in nuclear power, and in March, 2008 signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. on civilian nuclear cooperation. It has joined the IAEA and has deposited its Safeguards Agreement with that organization. The Government of Bahrain has formed an inter-ministerial committee to study the use of nuclear energy for power generation, and although the GOB recognizes that they do not have the resources to develop or operate a nuclear reactor on their own, they need the power and are interested in moving forward, ideally with an American commercial partner. 11. (U) In August 2006, the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement entered into force -- the culmination of a multiyear effort to open and reform Bahrain&apos;s economy. (In 2009, the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal ranked Bahrain as the freest economy in the Middle East, and the 16th freest in the world). Since the FTA went into effect, total bilateral trade has increased more than 25%. Bahrain recently rolled out its &quot;Economic Vision 2030&quot; plan, a statement of the GOB&apos;s aspirations for Bahrain&apos;s economy, government and society. The plan establishes broad goals of economic diversification and the construction of a strong middle-class as the basis for Bahrain&apos;s future. ---------------- LEADERSHIP STYLE ---------------- 12. (C) King Hamad is personable and engaging. He rules as something of a &quot;corporate king,&quot; giving direction and letting his top people manage the government. He has overseen the development of strong institutions with the restoration of parliament, the formation of a legal political opposition, and a dynamic press. He is gradually shifting power from his uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, who remains the head of the government, to his son, the Crown Prince. Crown Prince Salman received his high school education at the DOD school in Bahrain and earned a BA from American University in 1985. He is very Western in his approach and is closely identified with the reformist camp within the ruling family - particularly with respect to economic and labor reforms designed to combat corruption and modernize Bahrain&apos;s economic base. King Hamad is committed to fighting corruption and prefers doing business with American firms because they are transparent. U.S. companies have won major contracts in the past two years, including: Gulf Air&apos;s purchase of 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, a USD 5 billion joint-venture with Occidental Petroleum to revitalize the Awali field, and well over USD 300 million in Foreign Military Sales. ----------------------- HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFORM ----------------------- 13. (C) Internally, the acquittal of ten Shia men in October on charges of killing a Pakistani policeman in April 2008 has served to lower sectarian tensions. Local media reported that the presiding judge explained that the defendants&apos; claims that they confessed under duress had influenced his verdict. Despite this, the GOB&apos;s overall record on human rights remains positive on the whole. Allegations of private and government discrimination against Shia persist, but the democratic reforms of the past ten years have radically changed the political space. The mainstream Shia opposition, Wifaq, remains committed to the political process and the parliamentary experiment has been largely successful (ref A). Shia rejectionist groups Haq and Wafa&apos; inspire the youths who occasionally clash with police, but have not seriously threatened Wifaq&apos;s hold on the Shia street. 14. (C) Bahrain remains on the Tier Two Watchlist for human trafficking, but has enacted an anti-trafficking law and achieved one conviction. The government is also pursuing labor market reforms aimed at eliminating the sponsorship system. On August 1, it introduced labor mobility - allowing foreign workers to change jobs without obtaining prior permission from the current employer. G/TIP Ambassador CdeBaca&apos;s told GOB officials during his November 12 visit that they needed to focus on prosecution and victim identification. The Justice Minister noted during their meeting that Bahrain had prosecuted 280 trafficking-related crimes over the past year. 15. (C) Deputy Special Envoy for Middle East Peace Hale will have just met with the Foreign Minister on December 5 to brief him on recent developments.

The president has alienated everybody: not only Mubarak&apos;s cronies in the military, but also the youthful crowds in the streets of Cairo. Whoever ultimately wins, Obama loses. And the alienation doesn&apos;t end there. America&apos;s two closest friends in the region\u2014Israel and Saudi Arabia\u2014are both disgusted. The Saudis, who dread all manifestations of revolution, are appalled at Washington&apos;s failure to resolutely prop up Mubarak. The Israelis, meanwhile, are dismayed by the administration&apos;s apparent cluelessness. Last week, while other commentators ran around Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square, hyperventilating about what they saw as an Arab 1989, I flew to Tel Aviv for the annual Herzliya security conference. The consensus among the assembled experts on the Middle East? A colossal failure of American foreign policy. This failure was not the result of bad luck. It was the predictable consequence of the Obama administration&apos;s lack of any kind of coherent grand strategy, a deficit about which more than a few veterans of U.S. foreign policy making have long worried. The president himself is not wholly to blame. Although cosmopolitan by both birth and upbringing, Obama was an unusually parochial politician prior to his election, judging by his scant public pronouncements on foreign-policy issues.  This is kind of over the top, no? First of all, the Herzliya conference isn&apos;t a Peace Corps meeting; it&apos;s a pretty strongly neoconnish and right-leaning gathering, to varying degrees of seriousness; the closing night speaker this year, reports Matt Duss in The Nation, who attended, was none other than Haley Barbour. So of course the prevailing opinion there was bound to be that Obama had handled it disastrously. Then he launches into this whole comparison of Obama to Bismarck, noting that Bismarck immediately declared himself on the right side of history, no waffling about. All right. I haven&apos;t read my German unification history for a good 25 years, I admit, so I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a lot I&apos;m forgetting, but there is the fundamental fact that Bismarck was supporting the forces for German nationalism that were right there in central Europe and united by a culture and a language, whereas...what? Obama is supposed to be able to do the same with a country a third of the way around the world? It just seems silly. I&apos;ve written thousands of columns over the years. I know how it goes. Sometimes you get a bee in your bonnet and you let it rip. Every once in a great while you hit what we Americans call a tape-measure shot (please explain, someone). But time generally instructs that you should let those columns sit for a day and read them over once you&apos;ve calmed down. Oh yes, and then there&apos;s the part where Obama and Hillary ought to be acting more like Kissinger. Would that be the Cambodia Kissinger? Chile? East Timor? Or the one who lengthened the Vietnam war in Paris? Ferguson wants &quot;grand strategy,&quot; you see. Hey, he&apos;s Niall Ferguson. I&apos;m just me. But what if we live in a post-grand strategy age? Grand strategies (by which he means realpolitik, mainly) ensured stability, chiefly. Stability is good. But so are other things, and we are now in an age, quite unlike the 1970s, when the peoples of the developing world want more: freedom, opportunity, economic self-determination. The world can&apos;t be contained in the old Kennan sense these days, and should not be. I stand by what I said last week, and what both the Economist and Clive Crook say. Obama handled Egypt fine. The outcome, so far, is a positive one. The US didn&apos;t mess that up. Ferguson voices the frustrations of the Cairo protesters, the Israelis and the Saudis. But it&apos;s impossible that any US position could have satisfied all those players. You do the best you can.

He will refer to &quot;a strand of nihilism which is closing off the future here&quot;, he told the Guardian shortly after his arrival in Israel for the ceremony. His attendance has drawn bitter criticism from supporters of the Palestinian cause. The author took part in the weekly protest in Sheikh Jarrah, an area of East Jerusalem which has seen Jewish settlers evict Palestinian residents to take over their homes and establish hardline footholds in the Arab part of the city. In the company of the celebrated Israeli author David Grossman, McEwan spoke to activists who told him they appreciated his presence. &quot;The welcome I had from various strands of the Israeli peace movement completely vindicated my decision to come,&quot; he said. &quot;They feel the tide is running against them. I feel it&apos;s very important to support that important hope and conscience. It was very stirring.&quot; McEwan attempted to get close to the homes from which long-term Palestinian residents have been expelled by settlers but was prevented by Israeli security forces. &quot;But I got a good sense of how Palestinian families are waiting to be evicted,&quot; he said, adding they faced a &quot;relentless tide&quot;. He said he intended to &quot;make my own thoughts clear&quot; when accepting the prize from Jerusalem&apos;s mayor, Nir Barkat, an enthusiastic advocate of expanding the Jewish presence in the east of the city. East Jerusalem was occupied and later annexed by Israel in 1967 in a move illegal under international law and not recognised by most of the international community. Settlement building and expansion there has been a key issue blocking peace negotiations. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. McEwan said he planned to make further visits to East Jerusalem and the West Bank during his stay. Earlier, at a press conference in Tel Aviv, the author described Israel as a &quot;country with true democracy of opinion&quot; and defended his decision to receive the award, saying it was &quot;much more useful to come and engage and keep speaking&quot; than to freeze out or boycott Israel over its occupation of the Palestinian territories. &quot;I am very conscious of being in a country with a true democracy of opinion,&quot; he said. &quot;I am perfectly aware that you cannot isolate [literature] but I take it as a bad sign when politics permeates every corner of life. I don&apos;t feel I endorse every corner of Israel&apos;s domestic or foreign policy \u2026 but I feel it&apos;s right to engage with it.&quot; He said it was a great honour to be awarded the prize, to be presented at the opening of Jerusalem&apos;s International Book Fair, pointing to past recipients as &quot;writers and philosophers of such distinction&quot;. &quot;Like most people, I want Israel to flourish. I&apos;m very concerned that things have reached such a stalemate politically. It seems to me to be a rather depressing time politically to come here \u2013 but that makes it all the more urgent to keep talking.&quot; McEwan faced calls in the UK to reject the prize in protest at Israel&apos;s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories. In a letter to the Guardian last month, British Writers in Support of Palestine said the writer&apos;s acceptance of an award in recognition of individual freedom in society was &quot;a cruel joke and a propaganda tool for the Israeli state&quot;. The author responded at the time by saying that despite his opposition to illegal settlements, he was in favour of &quot;dialogue, engagement, and looking for ways in which literature \u2026 can reach across political divides&quot;. On Friday, he said it was a &quot;fatal error to confuse people with their governments&quot;. He had spent the past few weeks &quot;camped out in front of my television set&quot; watching the pro-democracy protests in Egypt and other countries in the region. He felt exhilarated by what he saw, and was struck by the swift collapse of the &quot;social contract \u2013 how people feel bold enough to withdraw their consent. Crowds aren&apos;t usually wise, but [the Egyptian protesters&apos;] restraint under pressure was heroic.&quot; But he warned that &quot;the story was still unfolding&quot;. Referring to the bloody response of the Bahrain regime to protests, he said: &quot;Egypt has raised the game for the tyrant \u2013 they know they&apos;ve got to get in quick and hold everyone down.&quot; He added: &quot;For every moment of exhilaration on the street, there is a Robespierre in waiting.&quot; He hoped the Israeli government would &quot;welcome the spread of democracy rather than be too distrusting. Netanyahu said Israel must hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Hoping for the best is not enough, maybe [Israel] should be agitating for the best.&quot; Israel, he suggested, should harness its creativity in other spheres to the peace process. &quot;Politics is too bunker. Israel needs to summon up the creative energy of its scientists, musicians, writers and artists and extend it into politics.&quot; He paid tribute to contemporary Israeli novelists such as Grossman, Amos Oz and AB Yehoshua, who &quot;had made a huge impact around the world&quot;. McEwan declined to discuss his next novel, saying only it was &quot;slightly more historical, meaning it&apos;s set in 1972&quot; than his latest book, Solar, about climate change. He hoped the award of the Jerusalem prize was not a valedictory on his career, &quot;especially as I&apos;m half way through my next novel. I feel like Mrs Thatcher: I will go on and on.&quot; Prize controversies The literary prize suggests a rarefied world, but it can also be a contentious one. Launched in 1996 to counter a perceived overlooking of women authors by existing literary awards, it was the Orange prize&apos;s very raison d&apos;\u00eatre that attracted ire. Amid widespread chuntering about it being discriminatory, Germaine Greer, pictured, complained that someone would soon found a prize for writers with red hair, while Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the Lemon prize. Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins wasn&apos;t happy either. &quot;The Orange prize is a blot on Britain&apos;s literary landscape,&quot; he wrote after its launch. In 2005 he expanded: &quot;I&apos;m amazed, frankly, that it&apos;s lasted so long. It validates all those men in the Garrick who refuse to admit women.&quot; The Booker prize The pre-eminent book award, the Booker prize, has also had brushes with notoriety. In 1972 John Berger used his acceptance speech to trot out the usual platitudes. Instead Berger launched a stinging attack on the prize itself, drawing attention to the fact the sponsors, Booker-McConnell, had acquired much of their wealth from 130 years of trading in the Caribbean. &quot;The modern poverty of the Caribbean is the direct result of this and similar exploitation,&quot; he said. Berger donated half his \u00a35,000 prize money to the Black Panthers \u2013 &quot;the black movement with the socialist and revolutionary perspective that I find myself most in agreement with in this country&quot;.

The absurd, if much vaunted, neocon notion that Arabs or Muslims were hostile to democracy has disappeared like parchment in fire. Those who promoted such ideas appear to the most unhappy: Israel and its lobbyists in Euro-America; the arms industry, hurriedly trying to sell as much while it can (the British prime minister acting as a merchant of death at the Abu Dhabi arms fair); and the beleaguered rulers of Saudi Arabia, wondering whether the disease will spread to their tyrannical kingdom. Until now they have provided refuge to many a despot, but when the time comes where will the royal family seek refuge? They must be aware that their patrons will dump them without ceremony and claim they always favoured democracy. If there is a comparison to be made with Europe it is 1848, when the revolutionary upheavals left only Britain and Spain untouched \u2013 even though Queen Victoria, thinking of the Chartists, feared otherwise. Writing to her besieged nephew on the Belgian throne, she expressing sympathy but wondered whether &quot;we will all be slain in our beds&quot;. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown or bejewelled headgear, and has billions stored in foreign banks. Like Europeans in 1848 the Arab people are fighting against foreign domination (82% of Egyptians, a recent opinion poll revealed, have a &quot;negative view of the US&quot;); against the violation of their democratic rights; against an elite blinded by its own illegitimate wealth \u2013 and in favour of economic justice. This is different from the first wave of Arab nationalism, which was concerned principally with driving the remnants of the British empire out of the region. The Egyptians under Nasser nationalised the Suez canal and were invaded by Britain, France and Israel \u2013 but that was without Washington&apos;s permission, and the three were thus compelled to withdraw. Cairo was triumphant. The pro-British monarchy was toppled by the 1958 revolution in Iraq, radicals took power in Damascus, a senior Saudi prince attempted a palace coup and fled to Cairo when it failed, armed struggles erupted in Yemen and Oman, and there was much talk of an Arab nation with three concurrent capitals. One side effect was an eccentric coup in Libya that brought a young, semi-literate officer, Muammar Gaddafi, to power. His Saudi enemies have always insisted that the coup was masterminded by British intelligence, just like the one that propelled Idi Amin to power in Uganda. Gaddafi&apos;s professed nationalism, modernism and radicalism were all for show, like his ghosted science-fiction short stories. It never extended to his own people. Despite the oil wealth he refused to educate Libyans, or provide them with a health service or subsidised housing, squandering money on absurdist projects abroad \u2013 one of which was to divert a British plane carrying socialist and communist Sudanese oppositionists and handing them over to fellow dictator Gaafar Nimeiry in Sudan to be hanged, thus wrecking the possibility of any radical change in that country, with dire consequences, as we witness every day. At home he maintained a rigid tribal structure, thinking he could divide and buy tribes to stay in power. But no longer. Israel&apos;s 1967 lightning war and victory sounded the death knell of Arab nationalism. Internecine conflicts in Syria and Iraq led to the victory of rightwing Ba&apos;athists blessed by Washington. After Nasser&apos;s death and his successor Saadat&apos;s pyrrhic victory against Israel in 1973, Egypt&apos;s military elite decided to cut its losses, accepted annual billion-dollar subsidies from the US and do a deal with Tel Aviv. In return its dictator was honoured as a statesman by Euro-America, as was Saddam Hussein for a long time. If only they had left him to be removed by his people instead of by an ugly and destructive war and occupation, over a million dead and 5 million orphaned children. The Arab revolutions, triggered by the economic crisis, have mobilised mass movements, but not every aspect of life has been called into question. Social, political and religious rights are becoming the subject of fierce controversy in Tunisia, but not elsewhere yet. No new political parties have emerged, an indication that the electoral battles to come will be contests between Arab liberalism and conservatism in the shape of the Muslim Brotherhood, modelling itself on Islamists in power in Turkey and Indonesia, and ensconced in the embrace of the US. American hegemony in the region has been dented but not destroyed. The post-despot regimes are likely to be more independent, with a democratic system that is fresh and subversive and, hopefully, new constitutions enshrining social and political needs. But the military in Egypt and Tunisia will ensure nothing rash happens. The big worry for Euro-America is Bahrain. If its rulers are removed it will be difficult to prevent a democratic upheaval in Saudi Arabia. Can Washington afford to let that happen? Or will it deploy armed force to keep the Wahhabi kleptocrats in power? A few decades ago the great Iraqi poet Mudhafar al-Nawab, angered by a gathering of despots described as an\u00a0Arab Summit, lost his cool: \u2026 Mubarik, Mubarik, Wealth and good health Fax the news to the UN. Camp after Camp and David, Father of all your Camps.

Most cases occur in the huge space that lies between genocidal calls against Jews and opposition to Israeli policy. For example, a recent speaker was advertised as talking about the &quot;Zionist lobby&quot; in the US, but repeatedly referred to &quot;the Jewish lobby&quot;, affording it conspiratorial power and reach. Week after week, students are subjected to tirades from resident and visiting academics who equate Zionism with racism, apartheid and sometimes even Nazi Germany \u2013 this, when most Jewish students are indeed Zionists, in the only real sense of the word, believing in the Jewish right to a state. Sometimes, visiting speakers are permitted to advocate or excuse terrorism, including suicide bombings, so long as Israel and Israeli civilians are to be the target, doubtless leaving their audiences to contemplate as and when such terrorism might be permitted in Britain also. Universities UK claim that this is about freedom of speech, but this is at best disingenuous. Put simply, if a speaker is in line with prevailing political orthodoxy, then they will be afforded the benefit of doubt and be permitted to speak. If a speaker contradicts that orthodoxy, then they will often be run off the campus. Ultimately, it is mob rule, as the Universities UK report itself demonstrates with its final sentence, &quot;permission [for meetings] may be withdrawn if adequate arrangements cannot be made to ensure that good order is maintained&quot;.

The liberal interventionists are back. As insurrection and repression has split Libya in two and the death toll has mounted, the old Bush-and-Blair battle-cries have returned to haunt us. The same western leaders who happily armed and did business with the Gaddafi regime until a fortnight ago have now slapped sanctions on the discarded autocrat and blithely referred him to the international criminal court the United States won&apos;t recognise. While American and British politicians have ramped up talk of a no-fly zone, US warships have been sent to the Mediterranean, a stockpile of chemical weapons has been duly discovered, special forces have been in action, Italy has ditched a non-aggression treaty with Tripoli and a full-scale western military intervention in yet another Arab country is suddenly a serious prospect. Egged on by his neoconservative lieutenants, David Cameron went furthest. Fresh from his tour selling arms to Gulf despots, the British prime minister talked excitedly about arming Libyan rebels, and only staged a hasty retreat when he found himself running ahead of the US administration. But neither American caution nor UN security council opposition should obscure the fact that there is now a serious danger of western armed action in Libya. Unlike in the rest of the region, we are no longer talking mainly about the security forces confronting demonstrators but a split in the heart of the regime and the military, with large areas of the country in the hands of an armed opposition. With Colonel Gaddafi and his loyalists\u00a0showing every sign of digging in, the likelihood must be of intensified conflict \u2013 with all the heightened pretexts that would offer for outside interference, from humanitarian crises to threats to oil supplies. But any such intervention would risk\u00a0disaster and be a knife at the heart\u00a0of the revolutionary process now sweeping the Arab world. Military action is needed, US and British politicians claim, because Gaddafi is &quot;killing his own people&quot;. Hundreds have certainly died, but that&apos;s hard to take seriously as\u00a0the principal motivation. When more than 300 people were killed by Hosni Mubarak&apos;s security forces in a couple of weeks, Washington initially called for &quot;restraint on both sides&quot;. In Iraq, 50,000 US occupation troops protect a government which last Friday killed 29 peaceful demonstrators demanding reform. In Bahrain, home of the US fifth fleet, the regime has been shooting and gassing protesters with British-supplied equipment for weeks. The &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; invoked by those demanding intervention in Libya is applied so selectively that the word hypocrisy doesn&apos;t do it justice. And the idea that states which are themselves responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands in illegal wars, occupations and interventions in the last decade, along with mass imprisonment without trial, torture and kidnapping, should be authorised by international institutions to prevent killings in other countries is simply preposterous. The barefaced cheek of William Hague&apos;s insistence that there would be a &quot;day of reckoning&quot; for the Libyan regime if it committed crimes or atrocities took some beating. The reality is that the western powers which have backed authoritarian kleptocrats across the Middle East for decades now face a loss of power in the most strategically sensitive region of the world as a result of the Arab uprisings and the prospect of representative governments. They are evidently determined to appropriate the revolutionary process wherever possible, limiting it to cosmetic change that allows continued control of the region. In Libya, the disintegration of the regime offers a crucial opening. Even more important, unlike Tunisia and Egypt, it has the strategic prize of the largest oil reserves in Africa. Of course the Gaddafi regime has moved a long way from the days when it took over the country&apos;s oil, kicked out foreign bases and funded the African National Congress at a time when the US and Britain branded Nelson Mandela a terrorist. Along with repression, corruption and a failure to deliver to ordinary Libyans, the regime has long since bent the knee to western power, as Tony Blair and his friends were so keen to celebrate, ditching old allies and nuclear ambitions while offering privatised pickings and contracts to western banks, arms and oil corporations such as BP. Now the prospect of the regime&apos;s fall offers the chance for much closer involvement \u2013 western intelligence has had its fingers in parts of the\u00a0Libyan opposition for years \u2013 when other states\u00a0seem in danger of spinning out of\u00a0the imperial orbit. But Libya has a compelling history of foreign occupation and resistance. Up to a third of the population are estimated to have died under Italian colonial rule. Those calling for western military action in Libya seem brazenly untroubled by the fact that throughout the Arab\u00a0world,\u00a0foreign intervention, occupation and support for dictatorship is regarded as central to the problems of\u00a0the region. Inextricably tied up with the demand for democratic freedoms is a profound desire for independence and\u00a0self-determination. That is clear in reaction on the ground in Libya to the threat of outside intervention. As one of the rebel military leaders in Benghazi, General Ahmad Gatroni, said this week, the US should &quot;take care of its own people, we can look\u00a0after ourselves&quot;. No-fly zones, backed by some other opposition figures, would involve a military attack on Libya&apos;s air defences and, judging from the Iraqi experience, be highly unlikely to halt regime helicopter or ground operations. They would risk expanding military conflict and strengthening Gaddafi&apos;s hand by allowing the regime to burnish its anti-imperialist credentials. Military intervention wouldn&apos;t just be a threat to Libya and its people, but to the ownership of what has been until now an entirely organic, homegrown democratic movement across the region. The embattled US-backed Yemeni president Ali Abdallah Saleh claimed on Tuesday that the region-wide protest movement was &quot;managed by Tel Aviv and under the supervision of Washington&quot;. That is easily dismissed as a hallucinogenic fantasy now. It would seem less so if the US and Britain were arming the Libyan opposition.

That apartheid government imposed a cultural blockade, so to speak, on certain songs, including mine. Twenty-five years later, in 2005, Palestinian children participating in a West Bank festival used the song to protest against Israel&apos;s wall around the West Bank. They sang: &quot;We don&apos;t need no occupation! We don&apos;t need no racist wall!&quot; At the time, I hadn&apos;t seen firsthand what they were singing about. A year later I was contracted to perform in Tel Aviv. Palestinians from a movement advocating an academic and cultural boycott of Israel\u00a0urged me to reconsider. I had already spoken out against the wall, but\u00a0I was unsure whether a cultural boycott was the right\u00a0way to go. The Palestinian advocates of a boycott asked that I visit the occupied\u00a0Palestinian territory to see the wall for myself before I made up my mind. I agreed. Under the protection of the United Nations I visited Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw that day. The wall is an appalling edifice to behold. It is policed by young Israeli soldiers who treated me, a casual observer from another world, with disdainful aggression. If it could be like that for me, a foreigner, a visitor, imagine what it must be like for the Palestinians, for the underclass, for the passbook carriers. I knew then that my conscience would not allow me to walk away from that wall, from the fate of the Palestinians I met: people whose lives are crushed daily by Israel&apos;s occupation. In solidarity, and somewhat impotently, I wrote on their wall that day: &quot;We don&apos;t need no thought control.&quot; Realising at that point that my presence on a Tel Aviv stage would inadvertently legitimise the oppression I had seen, I cancelled my gig at the stadium in Tel Aviv and moved it to Neve Shalom, an agricultural community devoted to growing chick peas and also, admirably, to co-operation between different faiths, where Muslim, Christian and Jew work side by side in harmony. Against all expectations it was to become the biggest music event in the short history of Israel. Some 60,000 fans battled traffic jams to attend. It was extraordinarily moving for us, and at the end of the gig I was moved to exhort the young people gathered there to demand of their government that they attempt to make peace with their neighbours and respect the civil rights of Palestinians living in Israel. Sadly, in the intervening years the\u00a0Israeli government has made no\u00a0attempt to implement legislation that would grant rights to Israeli Arabs equal to those enjoyed by Israeli Jews, and the wall has grown, inexorably, illegally annexing more and more of\u00a0the\u00a0West Bank. For the people of Gaza, locked in a virtual prison behind the wall of Israel&apos;s illegal blockade, it means another set of injustices. It means that children go to sleep hungry, many chronically malnourished. It means that fathers and mothers, unable to work in a decimated economy, have no means to support their families. It means that university students with scholarships to study abroad must watch the opportunity of a\u00a0lifetime slip away because they are not\u00a0allowed to travel. In my view, the abhorrent and draconian control that Israel wields over the besieged Palestinians in Gaza and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank (including East Jerusalem), coupled with its denial of the rights of refugees to return to their homes in Israel, demands that fair-minded people around the world support the Palestinians in their civil, nonviolent resistance. Where governments refuse to act people must, with whatever peaceful means are at their disposal. For me this means declaring an intention to stand in solidarity, not only with the people of Palestine but also with the many thousands of Israelis who disagree with their government&apos;s policies, by joining the campaign of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel. My conviction is born in the idea that all people deserve basic human rights. This is not an attack on the people of Israel. This is, however, a plea to my colleagues in the music industry, and also to artists in other disciplines, to join this cultural boycott. Artists were right to refuse to play in South Africa&apos;s Sun City resort until apartheid fell and white people and black people enjoyed equal rights. And we are right to refuse to play in Israel until the day comes \u2013 and it surely will come \u2013 when the wall of occupation falls and Palestinians live alongside Israelis in the\u00a0peace, freedom, justice and dignity that they all deserve.", "publicationDate": "2011-03-11T21:30:00Z", "title": "Tear down this Israeli wall | Roger Waters", "sentences": ["A year later I was contracted to perform in Tel Aviv.", "In solidarity, and somewhat impotently, I wrote on their wall that day: &quot;We don&apos;t need no thought control.&quot; Realising at that point that my presence on a Tel Aviv stage would inadvertently legitimise the oppression I had seen, I cancelled my gig at the stadium in Tel Aviv and moved it to Neve Shalom, an agricultural community devoted to growing chick peas and also, admirably, to co-operation between different faiths, where Muslim, Christian and Jew work side by side in harmony."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/cultural-boycott-west-bank-wall"}, {"tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Blogging", "Indie"], "article": " To download all 36 songs in one file click here  ARGENTINA   : Zonaindie Utopians - Pepe Le Pew Utopians is a garage rock band led by singer Barbi Recanati. They usually sound like a wild rampage of 70s-like guitar riffs and distortions, especially on their new album Freak. This song is the exception - an intimate acoustic ballad with Spanish lyrics inspired by a cartoon character.   AUSTRALIA  : Who The Bloody Hell Are They? Seekae - Gnor Seekae's new album +Dome is out on March 25 and I\u2019m super excited since their previous album, The Sound Of Trees Falling On People, is one of my favourite Australian albums of all time. When I say \"I'm super excited\", I am talking on your behalf \u2013 I already have a copy of the album and can confirm that it is fantastic. Gnor, the first 'official' single from the album (presumably because 2010 single Blood Bank features an updated and better mix here), is one of the closest songs to the sound of their debut, making it a good jumping-off point for people looking to get enveloped by their 'ghetto ambiance' all over again.  BRAZIL  : Meio Desligado Nuda - Maruimstad Preparing to release their first album in the coming months, Nuda is a promising band that mixes regional Brazilian rhythms with alternative rock and experimentation. Maruimstad expresses the most exciting facet of the band and shows their ability to innovate while pleasing from the first listen.  CANADA : I(Heart)Music Meligrove Band - Heart Attack Looking for power-pop perfection? Then look no further than Meligrove Band's Shimmering Lights. It's one of those albums from which you could pick a song at random - be it Heart Attack, Bones Attack!!! or any of the other eight tracks without the word \"Attack\" in the title - and you'd be guaranteed to come away listening to one of catchiest tunes you're ever likely to hear.  CHILE : Super 45 Prehist\u00f6ricos - Como Las Piedras Prehist\u00f6ricos formed during the summer of 2010, when actors Tom\u00e4s Preuss and Jessica Romo merged their musical ideas to create a collection of acoustic songs about teenage love. Their debut album La Orquesta Oc\u00falta (\"The Hidden Orchestra\") - released last October and available for free download here - received great reviews, focused mainly on the bright and naive nature of their repertoire. Mentioned in many Latin American media 'best of the year' lists, this duo are one of the highlights from a growing list of Chilean pop bands.  CHINA : Wooozy Omnipotent Youth Society - The Less Than Omnipotent Comedy Formed in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, in the late 90s, Omnipotent Youth Society take their influences from the Blind Melon sort of alternative American bands in the 90s, as well as jazz, blues and psychedelic noise. They released their debut album last year, which has been highly praised by critics and fans.  COLOMBIA  : Colombia Urbana Two Flow - Como Te Llamas Two Flow is a duo consisting of Charly and Fabio, singers from Barranquilla. Como Te Llamas is a collaboration with Punto G, a tropical band from the same city, and was named the No.1 song of the Barranquilla carnival. This combination of tropical and urban flavors have made Como Te Llamas a hit on the radio and in discoth\u00e8ques.  DENMARK : All Scandinavian Powersolo - I Love You But I Hate You It's 10 years since the release of \"donkey-punk\" duo Powersolo's debut album, Lemon Half Moon. To mark the occasion, Kim Kix and The Atomic Child (aka the Railthin Brothers aka Kim and Bo Jeppesen) have released their fifth album, Buzz Human. It's a generally great and always entertaining mash of psychobilly, 60s garage rock, punk, psychedelia, utter madness and catchy hooks.  ENGLAND : The Guardian Music Blog AlunaGeorge - Disobey  Aluna Francis is the one with the impossibly high, breathy-girly vocals and George Reid is the one responsible for the electronic production that seems to be as steeped in pop mores as it is aware of dubstep and R&B techniques. Imagine a 21st century Dollar if they\u2019d formed in the shadows of FWD>>, if you can picture such an exciting proposition. Disobey is a final mix exclusive, so now you can make your own minds up about the duo described variously in our New Band Of The Day column as \"fabulous\" and \"itchily glitchy\".  ESTONIA : Popop Kosmofon - Kvasar Kosmofon is a spaceship built in 2008 and commanded by Martin Laksberg, Rasmus Lill and Marten Kuningas. They listen in their secret laboratory to Sirius and examine neutron stars to open a new dimension to the music of outermost depths of space. Kosmofon's works are the memoirs of heroic astronauts and announcements of thousands and millions of light years formatted into progressive electronic music.  FINLAND : Glue Blackbird - Did I Say That I Loved You? Captain Cougar's Jussi Pet\u00e4j\u00e4 discovered Jenna-Miia Kaivosoja one night while watching TV singing competition Idols. Impressed by her performance of Dolly Parton's Jolene, they started collaborating and making real music. Now with the addition of keyboardist Matias Tyni, they have formed Blackbird to create a surprising combination of folk and bubblegum pop. If this first song is a good indication, their debut album due out in the summer will be catchy, cheesy and fun.  FRANCE : Yet You're Fired Young Michelin - Les Copains Young Michelin is a four-piece band led by Romain Guerret, an accomplished solo artist who made two albums under the name Dondolo. Signed to American label Holiday Records, they are trying to merge their 90s English indie-pop influences with the use of French language. Inspired by The Wake, The Field Mice and labels such as Sarah Records, they aim to make music that is simple and honest, and succeed brilliantly, as this instrumental shows.  GERMANY : Blogpartei Silent Portraits - Mama Music recorded in one take always has the charm of authenticity. And music recorded with lo-fi equipment in a bedroom can have wonderful results. As you listen to Silent Portraits, you feel the raw energy behind these sketches. Imperfect, powerful and benign, Maxi's voice and reverbed guitar create a warm and somewhat melancholic soundscape reminiscent of PJ Harvey or Becky Lee. You can download the other songs of this unsigned Berlin-based artist via MySpace or Bandcamp.  GREECE : Mouxlaloulouda Zebra Tracks - Isabelle Creeps Zebra Tracks collect their darkest impulses and put them on stark display. The single Bicycles / Isabelle Creeps brims with their vehement energy and constitutes an intriguing step in the evolution of their simple, yet oddly affecting, and certainly promising sound. A start-to-finish rush of invigorating riffs and pointed narratives that heightens with repeated exposure. A thrilling, incontrovertible evidence of their bright future.  ICELAND : Icelandic Music Maffia Ikea Satan  - The Wait The trio Ikea Satan plays satanic blues-metal. Unnar Kolka drums, P\u00e9tur \u00dalfur plays guitar and sings, and Hannes \u00de\u00f3r plays bass. The Wait is taken from their three-song Sound Of The Planet EP, released last year on Icelandic label Ching Ching Bling Bling.  INDIA : Indiecision Bombay Bassment - Hip-Hop [Never Be The Same] Mumbai electro rockers Bombay Bassment have lofty ambitions. Their brand of hip-hop meets drum 'n bass meets funk takes on established conventions of those genres - a careful mix of curated samples, some pro MC chops and an affinity to bass-driven melodies. Hip-Hop [Never Be The Same] puts those ambitions front and center. This is a band that's sure-footed and ready to, as cliched as it may sound, \"make it to the top\". We're certain they have the chops to do just that.  INDONESIA : Deathrockstar Amazing In Bed - Circle Amazing In Bed never stop growing as they keep making music with new approaches and refuse to take notice of critics. And now, even if we are able to trace the roots of their garage-punk songs, we still understand and recognize them as Amazing In Bed.  IRELAND : Nialler9 We Are Losers - Cheerleader The brainchild of Gavin Elsted, who has been joined by members of Super Extra Bonus Party and Grand Pocket Orchestra, We Are Losers have been directing shafts of sunshine lo-fi indie-rock into ear canals for the past six months. Cheerleader is a fine example of what the band do best. Catchy choruses, a hint of 50s pop, handclaps and happy melodies.  ISRAEL : Metal Israel Sonne Adam - We Who Worship The Black Jens Prueter, head of A&R at Century Media Europe, puts it best: \"We are proud to sign a young band from Tel Aviv, Israel that knows the meaning of death unfortunately better than most of us. Sonne Adam mix the old doom/death of early Paradise Lost and technical insanity of early Morbid Angel with a fresh passion and raw energy that reminds me of the hunger and dedication I heard 20 years ago, without sounding retro.\" Black Sabbath dirges mix with rabid speed to create an aural monstrosity. Check them out.  ITALY : Polaroid Casa Del Mirto - Faces Let's put aside the obvious comparisons to Washed Out and Neon Indian. Yes, you can call Casa Del Mirto 'chillwave' or 'glo-fi', but I feel the songs have a different mood, something more intimate, melancholic and familiar. Not to mention those gorgeously brilliant sounds. Casa Del Mirto is the project of Marco Ricci, from Trento. His new album, 1979, is out now on Mashhh! Records.  MEXICO : Red Bull PanameriKa To\u00f1o Tranquilino - Candyflip Hipekinetik is the solo album of To\u00f1o Tranquilino (drummer of stoner rock band Yokozuna), in which he explores many other forms of making music. Its sound tastefully blends 60s Brazilian psychedelia and heartfelt folk songs, led by a jazz-influenced piano. Candyflip stands out on the introspective 12-piece set, as a cathartic moment in his captivating relief which eventually becomes a self-discovery quest.  NETHERLANDS : Unfold Amsterdam Blues Brother Castro - Walk In The Park Few Amsterdam rock 'n' roll bands play with the same swagger and passion as Blues Brother Castro. Be it onstage or on record, their sound is typically raunchy guitars, waves of energy and savage calls. From beneath their well-worn 90s indie overcoat emerges elements reminiscent of Rob Tyner's howl, Ron Asheton's growl and even James Brown's scowl. It's been almost five years since they\u2019ve had new songs to showcase, but their third album, Out On The Beach, will be released via Excelsior Recordings on April 4.  NEW ZEALAND : Einstein Music Journal Orchestra Of Spheres - Boltzmann Brain Otherworldly psych and alien trance unite in Orchestra Of Spheres' hypnotic jams. The group has been entrancing audiences in their native Wellington and further afield for years, and never fail to leave jaws hanging at their free-spirited but tightly-wound motorik dance. Live, they're a spectacle of concept costumes, handmade instruments including a cake tin guitar and rack of keyboard foot pedals played by hand, and look as though an alien troupe descended the stage. Boltzmann Brain will induce in you their contagious mystic madness.  NORWAY : Birds Sometimes Dance Sandra Kolstad - The Devil Sandra Kolstad is a young woman who will release her debut album, Crux, in the spring. There's already quite a buzz around her here in Norway and this summer she'll play one of our biggest festivals, \u00d8ya. Her music is characteristic, peculiar electro-pop with a finesse that many other artists lack. Maybe it's her education in classical piano, maybe it's her gift at writing. I don't know, but I can hear hints of another great artist who masters both classical and indie, Owen Pallett, as well as traces of Fever Ray, Jenny Hval/Rockettothesky and maybe Dirty Projectors.  PERU : SoTB Futuro Incierto - Fue Ayer Futuro Incierto is one of the most symbolic Peruvian hardcore bands. Fronted by Pedro Allemant, their 20 years of melodic punk are proof of the musical experience they have gained. For their most recent record, Ego, some problems arose that forced them to re-record the content, yet it resulted in the best album of their career. In this work, the songs delve deep into personal themes, mature feelings and the conflicts caused by ego.  PORTUGAL : Posso Ouvir Um Disco? Mazgani - Beggar's Hands Shahryar Mazgani was born in Iran but moved to Portugal when he was just five. In 2005, Mazgani was considered one of the 20 best new European acts by French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. He has three albums and 2010's Song Of Distance, where this month's track is taken from, was acclaimed by the Portuguese media as one of the best rock records of the year.  ROMANIA : Babylon Noise Robin And The Backstabbers - Soare Cu Dinti Robin And The Backstabbers made their debut almost a year ago in Bucharest. The guys mix indie with what they call 'melodramatic pop' and the result is an upbeat nostalgic sound that gets to you in the best ways. They have released two singles, both very well received by the public and underground radio stations. This is their third one and, by the sound of it, I'm sure it's going to be another success.  SCOTLAND : The Pop Cop Little Eskimos - Start It Up You'd never guess that Little Eskimos' anthemic debut album Are You Still With Us? (available on Bandcamp) is the work of just one man - chief songwriter Kevin Harper played all the instruments and recorded it himself before getting a band together. Little Eskimos clearly owe a huge debt to the West Coast slacker rock sound, and the infectious Start It Up will leave you counting the days until their second album comes out in the summer. Keep up with them on Facebook in the meantime.  SINGAPORE : I'm Waking Up To... Caracal - Bears Brazen smatterings of post-hardcore and hard rock are the name of Caracal's game, something they do exceptionally well. There are shades of Underoath, Fugazi and mewithoutYou all over their straight-shooting, swashbuckler of an album, Bear. Shark. Wolf. Even if the music's genre isn't your cup of tea, one thing you can never fault this young band on is how proudly they wear their hearts on the sleeves, beating loudly for all the world to sit up and take notice.  SOUTH AFRICA : Musical Mover & Shaker! aKING - The Runaround When aKING embarked on their new album in 2010, they were ready to explore and venture into new territory. The Runaround, the first single from the band's third studio album The Red Blooded Years, shows off their formula of acoustic rock, distinctive vocals and riffs. There are also new sounds and influences that have crept in, with a distinct 80s feel shining through on many of the new tracks. The change has taken aKING to new heights.  SOUTH KOREA : Indieful ROK J Rabbit - aMorejo Super-lovely duo J Rabbit has been gathering a bit of attention since November last year when they first started posting music on YouTube via friendz.net. In March, the two girls released their first album, It's Spring, and they are now hoping it can provide their audience with delight and fresh energy. Supported by an acoustic guitar, aMorejo is a sweet song with lyrics that'll stick even if you can't understand the words.  SPAIN  : Musikorner Oso Leone - Rebellion Formed in Majorca, Oso Leone started to make their name at Levi's Unfamous Music Awards contest, in which they were finalists. They didn't win, but they were chosen as the supporting band for These New Puritans' Spanish tour and later signed to Foehn Records, home of Spanish indie acts such as Emilio Jos\u00e9 and Marina Gallardo. Using structures similar to Vic Chesnutt's, echoes of Americana and contemporary folk go hand in hand on their music and show that the boys are just a breath away from success.  SWEDEN : Swedesplease Impo & The Tents - Bubblegum Machine Punk-inspired garage rock from Stockholm's Impo & The Tents. Not much else to say about something so simple and forceful.  SWITZERLAND : 78s Cryptonites - Hey Kidz The two blokes behind Cryptonites surely do not intend to diminish the power of any superheroes. On the contrary, their objective is to strengthen young kids with their electrifying sound. With their new EP Hey Kidz in stock, these two sound manipulators might just accomplish their mission because the four-track material is a bona fide crowd pleaser. The centerpiece Hey Kidz is the heart and soul of the release on Freakz Me Out.  UNITED STATES : I Guess I'm Floating Cloud Nothings - Understand At All Cloud Nothings has it all: DIY bedroom charm, memorable melodies and jangly guitar work lost somewhere in an era of grunge and punk rock. This solo project from the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, packs a punch live too \u2013 something I plan on seeing for myself this month.  VENEZUELA  : M\u00fasica y M\u00e1s Planeador - El Regreso Planeador is a rock band with influences of folk, country and blues formed in Anzo\u00e1tegui in 2006. After playing at major festivals around the country, they finally released their first album in April 2010, which launched the single El Regreso. It has remained on the playlist of several radio stations with the video rotated on MTV Latin America. They are currently working on their second studio album.

Given our northern location and climate, we were never particularly spoiled agriculturally, though happily, potatoes and cabbage prospered. Publicly, the GDR seemed a gastronomic desert. Privately, it was totally different. Schnapps was self-made in the shed and rabbits were reared at home. But Berlin was a culinary wasteland. Tasty food in restaurants was scarce. And while there have been Greek and Italian restaurants around every corner for decades with their tzatziki, feta salad and spaghetti carbonara, for the masses, gastronomic culture meant mostly one thing: grabbing something fast, cheap and mostly rich in meat and carbohydrates. In urban areas this tended towards the d\u00f6ner kebab and currywurst. German menus have long been dominated by roasts, flour-based sauces and filling side dishes. Every region would boast a speciality unknown even 100 miles away. It&apos;s a Western European myth that we eat sauerkraut with everything. Though it is often served with roast pork and also goes nicely with bratwurst - and blaukraut (red cabbage) is served during the harvest in autumn and winter - that is pretty much it for us and the kraut. After the fall of the Berlin wall, eating out changed. Along with the wave of American chains, coffee to go, sushi shops, sandwiches and the usual fast food, came new forms of soups, pasta and Asian snacks. Next to the d\u00f6ner and currywurst imbiss, you may now find a falafel shop. Suddenly there were proper restaurants that wouldn&apos;t be out of place in New York, Tel Aviv or London. Design is now as important as the eating concept, wild herbs, well hung meat, cooking with entrails or special letters. The classic typically German restaurant is hard to find these days.  With my Berlin restaurant, Das Speisezimmer I try to run a responsible and sustainable kitchen using small and local producers, unusual and heritage varieties of vegetables. Jerusalem artichokes, Japanese potato and Linumer veal are as important as renewable energy and recycled paper for the menus. Others are trying their hand at molecular gastronomy and particularly expensive caviar. These days you can also find vegetarian food in nearly all cities. German society is paradoxical: we are putting more expensive oil in our cars than our bodies, while insisting on no GM crops. Groceries in Germany are among the cheapest in Europe; a loaded plate is too often seen as a sign of quality. But a lot is happening in the German food scene thanks to regional producers who have moved away from the agricultural industry and an ever growing community for whom food is more than just fuel. Foodies who are interested in the origin of the meat and vegetables they eat, who have banned stock cubes and ready-made sauces from their kitchens and celebrate with outstandingly cooked five-course meals in a restaurant. \u2022 Sarah Wiener is one of Germany&apos;s top chefs and restaurateurs", "publicationDate": "2011-03-18T13:01:00Z", "title": "New Europe: Sauerkraut with everything?", "sentences": ["Suddenly there were proper restaurants that wouldn&apos;t be out of place in New York, Tel Aviv or London."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/18/german-food-sarah-wiener"}, {"tags": ["Art", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "Photography", "Painting", "Installation", "Sculpture", "Chantal Joffe"], "article": "Chantal Joffe, London The women Chantal Joffe paints are often literally and metaphorically wide-eyed. While Joffe has taken painterly inspiration from the likes of Alice Neel, Picasso and Degas, her models&apos; origins tend to be fashion-magazine spreads, though she has also worked from her own photos of the backstage areas of catwalk shows. Her latest series transforms the stuff of glossy magazine fantasy to pay homage to her own idealised women. Drawing on the various histories of her artistic heroines, the paintings are fictional portraits inspired by everyone from spooky poet Emily Dickinson to abstract expressionist painter Lee Krasner and theorist Susan Sontag \u2013 though the models she uses bear no physical resemblance to these icon references. Joffe&apos;s palette is sombre \u2013 swathes of black, dark blue and earth colours \u2013 against which her women look eerily pale. Victoria Miro, N1, Sat to 21 Apr Skye Sherwin Philip Taaffe, Dublin The abstract and semi-abstract paintings of the renowned American artist Philip Taaffe go against several of modernism&apos;s aesthetic rules: they unashamedly use decoration, patterning, symmetry and charming colour combinations. According to the attitudes of so many of his American colleagues, Taaffe&apos;s work could so easily be dismissed as not much more than painterly pleasantries. What&apos;s more, the obvious debt his work pays to the elaborate designs of traditional Islamic architecture and eastern European textiles could be taken as exotic cultural exploitation. Yet anyone who comes face to face with a significant Taaffe show such as this is likely to be enchanted, even if at times reluctantly so. Irish Museum Of Modern Art, Wed to 12 Jun  Robert Clark Dirt: The Filthy Reality Of Everyday Life, London Obsessive grime-busters beware. This show is dedicated to the &quot;little animals of the microbial world&quot;, as the Anthony van Leewenhoek&apos;s put it, or dirt to the rest of us. Its history of muck begins with cleanliness-fixated domestic life in 17th-century Holland, moving on to the slums and pest-houses that crowded the streets of Victorian London, through to contemporary Delhi and, lastly, an American landfill site of the future. There&apos;s also some filthy-minded contemporary art: Igor Eskinja has made a Turkish rug from dust, suitable quarry perhaps for Susan Collis&apos;s jewelled broom. Other highlights include videos by Bruce Nauman and Mierle Ukeles, plus a new commission from Serena Korda. Wellcome Collection, NW1, Thu to 31 Aug SS Ant Macari, Sunderland A carved hole cut into a specially constructed partition wall appears to trace the outline of the elevated figure of God in Michelangelo&apos;s Sistine Chapel ceiling. Step through, and you get to Ant Macari&apos;s mysteriously titled exhibition \u2013 Get out and troop the shape of the void. With all his cross-references between symbols, cosmic diagrams and mathematical quandaries, it can be hard to tell whether Macari is being deeply earnest or, well, having us on. Here&apos;s a &quot;welcoming committee&quot; using casts of the artist&apos;s hands, each holding a &quot;harmonograph&quot; drawing of the universe. In the next room there&apos;s a Zen garden where the rocks have been replaced by monitors playing videos of the artist engaged in rituals such as brushing his teeth. After all, all that heady spirituality would be a bit much without a healthy grounding in banal absurdities. NGCA, Thu to 18 Jun RC Monika Kinley: A Life In Art, Plymouth Collector, curator and erstwhile art dealer, Monika Kinley is well known as an aficionado of outsider art. However, as this autobiographical exhibition demonstrates, her interests are wide-ranging: Paula Rego and Jack Smith rank among the canonical names here, though the outsider artists whose work also features are no less noteworthy, something that&apos;s partly down to the diligence of both Kinley and her late partner, Victor Musgrave, who co-curated the Hayward gallery&apos;s seminal outsider art exhibition of 1979. Henry Darger&apos;s obsessive drawings of little girls or Madge Gill&apos;s detailed images, which she believed were guided by a spirit called Myrninerest, are key examples. Plymouth Arts Centre, to 1 May SS Guy Ben-Ner, Sheffield Guy Ben-Ner makes deceptively simple videos which make all kinds of furtive references to the history of cinema, documentary film, classical literature and theatre. Drop The Monkey, a &quot;live film&quot;, was created over 25 trips between his native Tel Aviv and his girlfriend&apos;s Berlin home. Tourist Trap (aka Spies) makes use of similar unsophisticated techniques as the artist invites various tourists to shoot individual episodes of a half-scripted half-improvised storyline. The culturally reflective references accumulate incongruously: Tourist Trap&apos;s 12 protagonists apparently refer to the &quot;12 spies&quot; sent by Moses, against God&apos;s express wishes, to scout Israel, resulting in 40 years in the wildness. Site Gallery, to 14 May RC Syd Barrett: Art And Letters, London This show promises a truly unique glimpse into the private creative world of prog rock&apos;s great, troubled genius: Syd Barrett, the mastermind behind early Pink Floyd, who crash-landed as a drugs casualty, living out the remainder of his days in relative obscurity. Love letters to girlfriends back in his hometown, Cambridge, have a heartbreaking, boyish innocence; tales of art-school days and even his debut recording session are surrounded by doodles depicting cartoon cats, stickmen, boats and musical equipment. His expressionist paintings, with surrealist leanings, feature everything from tribesmen to a tortoise. There&apos;s also previously unseen childhood snaps and photos by Mick Rock, which had previously been thought lost. Idea Generation Gallery, E2, to 10 Apr SS Flatpack Festival, Birmingham The now annual Flatpack Festival is certainly an unorthodox collection of films, with a distinct spirit of irreverent mischief underlying its electric mix of screenings, performances and talks. So you get everything from the proto-sauciness of Mae West&apos;s 1933 She Done Him Wrong through to the YBA Gillian Wearing&apos;s first film Self Made, for which she typically placed an ad in a local paper saying, &quot;Would you like to be in a film? You can play yourself or a fictional character. Call Gillian.&quot; There&apos;s a moody orchestration of strobes and smoke by Film Ficciones, with a live soundtrack by Pram. There&apos;s the cult 1992 feature In Bed With Chris Needham, an adolescent tantrum/rant against just about everything grown-up. And there&apos;s Mutant Girls Squad, a recent offering from Sushi Typhoons, in which a gang of rebel angels includes a girl who can summon a chainsaw at will. Out of her bum. You get the picture.

In La Peste (The Plague), the French-Algerian author and philosopher explored through allegory the deep-seated malaise that he believed shaped and determined the human condition. At its core, society \u2013 and the body politic \u2013 was rotten and absurd. From Libya to Egypt to Yemen, millions have come to recognise this diseased reality, and are trying valiantly to change it. Syria is the latest Middle Eastern government to succumb to what might be termed &quot;regime-itis&quot;, a metaphorical contagion, both liberating and deadly, that spreads faster than the time it takes a secret policeman to pick up his truncheon. In eerie succession, one after another, autocrats and despots across the region are coming down with freedom flu. Like a virus, it spreads, from mouth to mouth and hand to hand, allowing prior immunity to none. There is no cure. The symptoms presented by Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime in Damascus fit this diagnosis. What began as a prank by a group of children in the southern city of Deraa, spraying anti-government graffiti on walls, has escalated into large-scale protests, echoing across the country. The regime is trying repression and on Wednesday, at least 37 people were killed. But this only sparked even bigger demonstrations. Assad is also trying concessions, including the possible relaxation of emergency laws and media controls. But so far, at least, nothing works. More and more people appear to be overcoming the &quot;fear factor&quot; that has kept Syrian society in check during what the Guardian&apos;s former Middle East correspondent, David Hirst, has called 51 years of &quot;republican monarchy&quot;. As their numbers increase, the opposition&apos;s demands grow proportionately in ambition and scale. This is what happened in Egypt and in Libya, and is happening now in Yemen. Next up, if he runs true to form, Assad will sack his interior minister or perhaps the whole government. Through spokesmen, the president is already denying personal responsibility for the killings. When he gives an interview to Christiane Amanpour, promising reform, it will be a certain sign his time is up. Except calmer heads say Syria is not there yet, and perhaps never will be, for a host of prosaically unrevolutionary reasons. Syria is approaching &quot;a defining moment for its leadership&quot;, the independent International Crisis Group (ICG) warned. &quot;There are only two options. One involves an immediate and inevitably risky political initiative that might convince Syrians the regime is willing to undertake dramatic change. The other entails escalating repression, which has every chance of leading to a bloody and ignominious end,&quot; it said. But like other analysts, the ICG suggested Assad, said to be relatively popular with the public, could yet survive the maelstrom: &quot;A window of opportunity still exists to change these dynamics, although it is fast closing \u2026 A broad range of citizens \u2013 including members of the security apparatus \u2013 is desperately waiting for [Assad] to take the lead and propose, before it is too late, an alternative to spiralling confrontation.&quot; This alternative should include a transparent investigation into the Deraa killings, the release of all political prisoners, and a timetable for constitutional reform, it said. Assad may have to move fast, for political vultures are already circling. Without naming names, the regime is blaming outsiders for fomenting the unrest. While that is unlikely, old foes in Baghdad, Riyadh and Beirut would not shed many tears should Assad stumble. That goes for Washington, too. Speaking in Tel Aviv on Thursday, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, urged an Egyptian-style army mutiny. Gates said: &quot;I would say that what the Syrian government is confronting is in fact the same challenge that faces so many governments across the region, and that is the unmet political and economic grievances of their people. Some are dealing with it better than others. I&apos;ve just come from Egypt, where the Egyptian army stood on the sidelines and allowed people to demonstrate and in fact empowered a revolution. The Syrians might take a lesson from that.&quot; Syria&apos;s Kurds and Sunnis who resent the Alawi minority&apos;s ascendancy might also welcome a shakeup. And Steven Cook, of the US Council on Foreign Relations, was quick to highlight possible external benefits. &quot;If a new, decent government emerged in Syria, it would alter the regional balance [and] improve the prospects for regional peace,&quot; Cook said \u2013 meaning Israel-Palestine. In theory, a democratic Damascus would be bad news for Hezbollah and Iran, and thus good news for the west. But there are plenty of pragmatic and strategic reasons to fear the unpredictable consequences of revolution in Syria, too \u2013 not least instability on the borders of Israel and Iraq and the precedent it might set for Saudi Arabia, the west&apos;s oil pump, already struggling with freedom flu. If Syria, far more important in the scale of things than Libya, descended into civil strife or even civil war, wrong-footed western powers might have another powerful reason to regret their distracting rush to war with Muammar Gaddafi.", "publicationDate": "2011-03-25T17:30:00Z", "title": "Syria's Bashar al-Assad has been struck by freedom flu | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["Speaking in Tel Aviv on Thursday, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, urged an Egyptian-style army mutiny."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/25/syria-bashar-al-assad-freedom"}, {"tags": ["Libya", "United Nations", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Africa"], "article": "United States | Russia | China | Israel | Iran | Egypt | Arab states | Germany | Italy | France | Turkey | India  | Canada | Venezuela | Africa  United States The conflict in Libya has fractured the United States. The air strikes have seen an outpouring of criticism against Barack Obama from his Republican critics. Opponents of the Iraq war may raise an eyebrow, but Republican leaders have criticised Obama for not clearly stating a mission goal and for risking getting US troops involved in a protracted conflict in a Muslim country. &quot;Nine days into this military intervention, Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question: what does success in Libya look like?&quot; said the Republican House leader, John Boehner. But Republicans have been joined by some Democrats, especially on the left of the party. They are worried about the effect of another military intervention on an already stretched army and a stuttering economy. They also say Obama&apos;s actions in ordering the strikes without consulting Congress remind them too much of President George W Bush. Dennis Kucinich, a liberal Ohio congressman, is organising moves with some Republicans to try to cut federal funding for the conflict. &quot;There is no question the president exceeded his constitutionally authorised authority,&quot; he told Fox News. Other concerns have been raised over the prospect of arming the Libyan rebels and fears over who makes up the Libyan opposition. The result has been a public left divided and confused. Some 47% of Americans said the US was doing the wrong thing by fighting in Libya, according to a Quinninpiac poll. But at the same time 65% said they supported the use of military force to protect civilians. Paul Harris New York Russia Moscow&apos;s reaction to Operation Odyssey Dawn has exposed a split in Russia&apos;s ruling elite. While the Kremlin abstained in the UN security council vote, Vladimir Putin, the prime minster, took a hawkish stance last week, saying the resolution was &quot;defective and flawed&quot; and resembled &quot;a medieval call for the Crusades&quot;. The same day, Dmitry Medvedev, who as president is responsible for setting the country&apos;s foreign policy, appeared to slap down his political ally when he said it was &quot;inadmissible to use expressions like the Crusades that, in essence, can lead to a clash of civilisations&quot;. Russia&apos;s former ambassador to Tripoli has since stirred up the argument, saying the failure to protect billions of dollars of Russian business contracts in Libya &quot;can be considered a betrayal of Russia&apos;s interests&quot;. Both Russia&apos;s parliament and the defence minister, Anatoly Serdyukov, have called for a ceasefire. For its part, the foreign ministry has kept faith with Medvedev&apos;s line: insisting that protecting civilian lives should be Nato&apos;s &quot;overriding priority&quot; while stressing that Gaddafi&apos;s future is an issue for Libyans alone. Meanwhile, a survey of Russians by the VTsIOM polling agency published last week found that 62% of respondents were against foreign intervention in Libya. Dmitry Babich, an analyst with the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency, summed up a common view when he wrote that &quot;liberal-optimists&quot; in the west were obsessed with toppling tyrants while giving little thought to the consequences. Tom Parfitt Moscow China China abstained in the security council vote despite its doctrinal opposition to interference in other countries&apos; domestic affairs, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman citing &quot;the concerns and stances of Arab countries and the African Union&quot;. But Beijing voiced &quot;regret&quot; at the strikes as soon as they began and within two days had strengthened its criticism, expressing deep concern. &quot;The original intent of the resolution was to protect the security of the Libyan people. We oppose the wanton use of armed force causing even more civilian casualties and an even bigger humanitarian disaster,&quot; said foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. State media have attacked the western allies for hypocrisy and accused them of acting from self-interest, particularly as the debate about the resolution&apos;s scope has developed. An editorial in the Global Times, a popular nationalist tabloid, complained this week: &quot;Although Libya had announced a ceasefire and was willing to talk to the opposition forces, western countries still carried on the air raids, after making the UN pass their smartly designed no-fly zone resolution ... Although it is under the name of &apos;protecting human rights and civilians&apos;, it is for their own economic and political interest.&quot; The People&apos;s Daily, the official Communist party newspaper, said in another commentary: &quot;The air raids clearly go against the original goal of protecting civilians in Libya. There has been a long history of western countries having double standards.&quot; Tania Branigan Beijing Israel The country \u2013 its people and its government \u2013 view events in Libya with alarm. If the Middle Eastern status quo pre-Tunisia was not ideal, it was stable and clear. Now there has been rapid change which has left everyone feeling insecure. Haaretz noted in its editorial on Wednesday that military intervention may transform the Facebook revolution into the Tomahawk revolution and undermine the legitimacy of civilian movements elsewhere in the Middle East. Many see the western intervention as further evidence of international hypocrisy, which would condemn Israel for airstrikes on an Arab country but not Nato. Other commentators see the intervention as a further example of western naivete and argue that Arabs are incapable of being democratic so western intervention can only bring about a different kind of autocratic regime. The Israeli government is more concerned about the indirect consequences of the intervention in Libya. First, officials say they believe they will come under increased diplomatic pressure to move forward with the Palestinian peace process as European counties try to demonstrate their actions in Libya are not anti-Arab or anti-Muslim. Second, Israel is concerned that a Libya-style popular uprising does not occur in Syria and Jordan. It is symbolic of Israel&apos;s confusion that it is fearful of the fall of its enemy, Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria and sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah. Shlomo Bron, a defence analyst at Tel Aviv University, said: &quot;We have not had any special problems with Gaddafi and so it does not matter who comes after him. Israel is more concerned with the countries with whom it shares a border or those who have a strategic capacity to harm Israel such as Iran.&quot; Conal Urquhart Jerusalem Iran Tehran has condemned the US-led military intervention in Libya despite supporting the revolt against Gaddafi. The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has accused western governments of attempting to gain control over Libya&apos;s oil but voiced support for the anti-Gaddafi rebels. &quot;They claim they want to defend the people by carrying out military operations or by entering Libya ... You did not come to defend the people, you&apos;ve come after Libya&apos;s oil,&quot; he said in a live television broadcast in the holy city of Mashhad in east of Iran. &quot;Iran condemns the military action in Libya.&quot; Iran has praised the pro-democracy movements in the Arab world but it has found itself in a peculiar situation with the unrest in Syria, an ally, where, by contrast, it has supported the regime. At the same time, several officials in Tehran have said the military intervention in Libya reflects &quot;the double standards&quot; of western governments in enforcing a no-fly zone in support of rebels while &quot;staying silent&quot; over the suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Bahrain. The opposition reaction to the intervention has also been mixed. Some have said they are worried for the lives of civilians while others have welcomed it as a means to stop Gaddafi killing Libyans. Meanwhile, Iran&apos;s Red Crescent Society has sent medical supplies and food to the Tunisian border to aid Libyan refugees. Saeed Kamali Dehghan Egypt For Egypt, the Libya crisis creates a problem on its own doorstep. So far the approach has been quietly pragmatic, with the army moving to try to help Egyptians leave but doing or saying little else publicly. Despite supporting the Arab League&apos;s initial stance in favour of a western-enforced no-fly zone, Egypt&apos;s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces \u2013 in effect governing by decree until parliamentary elections later this year \u2013 has resisted international pressure to get involved and add a sheen of &quot;Arab legitimacy&quot; to the operation. &quot;Egypt can&apos;t take part for two reasons: the fear that Gaddafi would target its citizens living in the troubled country and also because Egypt&apos;s military is concerned with administrating the internal affairs of the nation,&quot; Mohamed Abdel Salam, a national security expert, told the newspaper al-Masry al-Youm. Egypt&apos;s foreign minister has said categorically the interim government is not arming the rebels across the border, which stretches 1,000km through the Sahara up to the Mediterranean. Popular opinion remains divided, with many supporting grassroots efforts to topple Gaddafi but opposed to the involvement of the west. Last week al-Azhar \u2013 a Cairo-based university that represents the highest authority in Sunni Islam \u2013 issued a condemnation of &quot;military aggression&quot; by western countries, although it insisted that it backed the demands of the Libyan revolution. Opinion writers have also weighed in firmly against air strikes: political analyst Refaat Sayyed Ahmad has argued that the US and its allies are intervening in Libya only because that country&apos;s oil reserves are not under Washington&apos;s control and accused the Egyptian secretary-general of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, of being &quot;an agent for the west&quot;. When the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, visited Cairo recently he was attacked by pro-Gaddafi supporters and forced to abandon a planned visit to Tahrir Square. Jack Shenker Arab states In the Middle East, a personal spat between Colonel Gaddafi and the Arab League chief, Amr Moussa, has provided some entertaining diversion from difficult questions about the military action in Libya. Presumably piqued by the league&apos;s backing of intervention, Gaddafi is claiming that he had earlier bribed Moussa with the gift of a car. Moussa insists the car was given to the league and not to him personally, and has responded by calling Gaddafi &quot;a donkey&quot; and &quot;a miser&quot;. Across the Arab countries there is a lot of ambivalence about the intervention and where it might lead. The Jeddah-based Arab News hedges its bets between suspicions that &quot;western interest in Libya is driven by the oil factor&quot; and the possibility that &quot;there&apos;s some truth&quot; in Obama&apos;s claim that intervention prevented a massacre. It also thinks Obama may have broken away from the Bush era&apos;s &quot;toxic legacy&quot;. It says: &quot;This is a welcome change in the US policy, if it&apos;s indeed a change.&quot; Qatar \u2013 the first Arab country to participate in the action over Libya \u2013 attended Tuesday&apos;s conference on Libya in London. On Wednesday the pan-Arab daily Asharq Alawsat published an article written jointly by the British prime minister, David Cameron, and the Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. &quot;It must be for the Libyan people to choose the future they want,&quot; they wrote. &quot;But today, as things stand, they have little chance to determine their own destiny. That is why it is essential we continue to enforce the UN sanctions on the Gaddafi regime \u2013 and it is why the international community must do everything possible to help the Libyan people.&quot; On al-Jazeera&apos;s website political analyst Marwan Bishara considers whether a &quot;Libyan Karzai&quot; might be installed \u2013 as happened in Afghanistan \u2013 but ends by dismissing the idea. &quot;Libya isn&apos;t likely to emerge as a client state, or be led by client leadership,&quot; he says, &quot;no matter how long the Nato bombardment goes on or how long Gaddafi holds on to power.&quot; Brian Whitaker Germany Germany has been the key European country most sharply opposed to the Libyan campaign, putting it at odds with its main European partner, France. Berlin shocked its allies by abandoning the transatlantic ties with the US, Britain and France and siding with the &quot;Brics&quot; \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 in abstaining on the UN security council resolution authorising air strikes. &quot;We don&apos;t want to get involved in a civil war in north Africa,&quot; Guido Westerwelle, the foreign minister, has repeatedly stated. He publicly claims vindication for that position in the ambivalence among the Arab League. Indignant allies charge that, in making such statements, he is actively encouraging Arab resistance to the &quot;coalition&quot; \u2013 now Nato \u2013 campaign. But Westerwelle, whose political fortunes are in the pits, does not make German foreign policy. He could have been overruled by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who, not for the first time, stands accused of dithering, putting domestic politics above all else and determinedly following rather than leading public opinion. The public, the most pacifist of the big European states, is against involvement. Elite opinion worries, however, that Merkel has blown Germany&apos;s chances of obtaining a permanent security council seat and has hardened international suspicions of German isolationism and unreliability. &quot;I am ashamed,&quot; said Joschka Fischer, the former foreign minister. While her position is popular, Merkel&apos;s calculation that it would pay political dividends has backfired badly. Her Christian Democrats slumped to a historic defeat at the weekend in the prosperous south-western state of Baden-W\u00fcerttemberg. Westerwelle&apos;s liberal Free Democrats fared even worse. Merkel&apos;s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, exploited the anti-war line in Iraq in 2003 to win a surprise second term. Merkel failed at the weekend to repeat the trick. Ian Traynor Italy The prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, set the tone for his approach to the Libyan conflict by stating, as protests first flared against Colonel Gaddafi, that he would rather not &quot;bother&quot; him. Since then, Italy&apos;s foreign ministry has worked to claw back the diplomatic initiative from Berlusconi, who has previously handled relations with Libya as the result of his close ties to Gaddafi which opened the way to extensive Italian business interests in Libya. The proposal by the foreign minister, Franco Frattini, to send Gaddafi into exile in another African country found favour among allies while Italian airbases have welcomed coalition aircraft \u2013 though when the Italian air force took to the skies Berlusconi promised they were not dropping bombs. Reaction to the conflict has been mixed in Italy, with polls showing that 53% of the public oppose it and only 42% approve. Statements from rebels on how Italian businesses will be treated by a post-Gaddafi government are closely monitored, with Corriere della Sera reporting on Wednesday that &quot;with Rome, there is a cold relationship&quot;. Reports suggest Berlusconi was upset at being excluded from a video conference between the leaders of France, Germany, the US and UK before Tuesday&apos;s Libya conference in London and his publications have attacked French president Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s aggressive approach to Libya. As one Italian policeman watching France send north Africans back across the border into Italy put it: &quot;France gets the petrol and it is left to us to offer a helping hand (to migrants).&quot; Tom Kington Rome France The intervention in Libya has widespread support among the French population and political parties. The last poll carried out two days ago showed 66% of those asked supported the military operation and that most political parties, with the notable exception of the Parti Communiste, agreed. Sarkozy is currently in China where the president, Hu Jintao, criticised French involvement in the military operation, something France was trying to play down. On Wednesday the chief of staff of the French air force, Jean-Paul Palomeros, said: &quot;The air campaign in Libya is more difficult and complex than the interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo were.&quot; He said what was needed was &quot;patience&quot;. &quot;The nearer we get to urban centres the more difficult it becomes.&quot; Kim Willsher Paris Turkey Turkey has carefully watched the unfolding events, with its leaders claiming they can mediate a political end to the conflict and warning against western military action. &quot;Measures will surely be taken if civilians come under any threat. But without such a threat, a military action, a bombardment is out of question,&quot; the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said this week. Turkey is the sole Muslim member of Nato and officials have warned that the outcome of a military intervention might be similar to those in Afghanistan and Iraq, accusing countries such as France of being focused on Libya&apos;s natural resources. &quot;I wish they would look at Libya with a conscientious eye instead of an eye for oil,&quot; the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said. The media have applauded the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) for asserting itself against western countries and also its ability to negotiate with both Muammar Gaddafi and opposition forces. &quot;These steps have brought Turkey a step closer to its vision of being a country that is not influenced, but influences, that is not determined, but determines,&quot; Turkish columnist Yusuf Ergen wrote in the newspaper Today&apos;s Zaman. However, Turkey appears committed to western efforts to end the conflict. According to Davutoglu, Turkey will join a &quot;contact group&quot; that aims to help Libya during its transition process. &quot;Turkey will take part in this contact group. The shape and the functions of the group have yet to be decided, but Turkey will definitely be there.&quot; Justin Vela Istanbul India Reaction in Delhi to the launch of Operation Odyssey Dawn has been largely negative. At an official level, the last weeks have seen a reversion to a classic Indian foreign policy, analysts say. The Libyan crisis has posed New Delhi its first major challenge as a new non-permanent rotating member of the United Nations security council \u2013 a position the emerging power hopes will become permanent. However few concessions have been made to the United States, with whom relations have improved markedly in recent years, or Europe. Instead India abstained from the vote on UN resolution 1973 saying publicly that &quot;the use of force [was] totally unacceptable and must not be resorted to&quot; and expressing concern for &quot;the welfare of the civilian population and foreigners in Libya&quot;. &quot;New India appears to be following a pretty old Indian thinking,&quot; one western diplomat in Delhi said. The fence-sitting reflected the traditional axes of Indian foreign policy: non-alignment with major powers and opposition to intervention in the affairs of sovereign states, local diplomats say. The policy largely reflects public opinion. In parliament and the media, many on the right and particularly the left attacked &quot;American-led western imperialism&quot; and &quot;adventurism&quot;. Last week Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister and leader of the lower chamber in parliament, the Lok Sabha, said events in Libya were &quot;an internal affair&quot;. &quot;Nobody, no two or three countries can take a decision to change a particular regime in a third country. No external powers should interfere in it,&quot; he told MPs. An editorial in the Hindu newspaper argued that &quot;the absence of clear aims heightens the risk of an open-ended conflict, into which the foreign participants will \u2026 be drawn more and more deeply with the additional risk that the main aim becomes regime change and not civilian protection.&quot; The newspaper said that it was regrettable that Russia and China &quot;abstained instead of vetoing the resolution that has enabled this military aggression and expanding war in an already tormented region.&quot; However, press coverage has been largely sympathetic to the Libyan rebels, perhaps better reflecting views of ordinary Indians. Jason Burke Delhi Canada Politics is in turmoil in Canada. After the fall of Stephen Harper&apos;s Conservative government an election campaign is under way and the country&apos;s role in Libya is an issue. Harper has been under fire for months for spending billions of dollars on new F-35 fighter jets. Opponents have argued that in a time of economic problems worldwide such expense on defence is unnecessary. Now, however, the Canadian air force has deployed its planes to fly over Libya and some leftwing commentators have connected the dots and portrayed it as a cynical move to justify defence expense. Others, however, have said that intervention shows why Canada needs a strong military. &quot;Libya shows why Canada needs jets,&quot; read a headline in the Ottawa Citizen. As part of Nato, Canada now finds that one of its generals, Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard, has been placed in charge of the mission. Unlike in the US, however, where Obama did not consult Congress, there was a debate on Libya in the Canadian parliament. All major parties backed the UN resolution calling for intervention and supported Canadian military involvement. But as the election campaign has kicked off most politicians have preferred to keep the focus of their campaigning on domestic issues rather than the thorny territory of the Libyan conflict. &quot;The Conservative government and all three opposition parties agreed that Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi is a bad dude ... then they got back to the real business of Canadian politics: slagging one another over which party is the most dishonest,&quot; wrote Toronto Star columnist Thomas Walkom. Paul Harris Venezuela Venezuela&apos;s government has condemned the air strikes in Libya as an imperialist oil-grab against a socialist ally, reflecting President Hugo Chavez&apos;s close ties to Gaddafi. &quot;The imperialists are taking off their masks. They attack without any moral limits and invent anything to bomb and kill people to &apos;protect them&apos;,&quot; Chavez said this week. He complained of a US-backed effort to demonise him along with Libya&apos;s leader as a prelude to a military attack against Venezuela to topple its socialist experiment and control its vast oil reserves. &quot;Don&apos;t you see that there are efforts to label Chavez and Gaddafi as dictators, cruel dictators who persecute their people?&quot; When Libya&apos;s rebellion erupted Chavez&apos;s support for Gaddafi was tentative but once western planes started bombing he endorsed his ally as an embodiment of Libyan sovereignty. Venezuelan ministers and state-backed media have echoed the president&apos;s accusations that the air campaign was massacring civilians. &quot;The rebels tried last Sunday to take control of Sirte confident in the help of indiscriminate bombing of Libya&apos;s coast by the imperialist coalition led by the United States, France, the United Kingdom,&quot; said Telesur. Many opposition politicians and media outlets, in contrast, have welcomed western intervention as a legitimate effort to stop a brutal dictator slaughtering his own people. A newsreader on Globovision went so far as to accuse Gaddafi&apos;s troops of &quot;genocide&quot;. In the absence of opinion polls analysts suspect the highly polarised country has split over the bombing along pro- and anti-Chavez lines. Rory Carroll Caracas Africa South Africa&apos;s support of the UN resolution has proved hugely divisive at home. Tom Wheeler, research associate at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said the decision had set the right tone to overcome past criticism of South Africa for opposing UN sanctions on Burma and Zimbabwe. But there has been strong condemnation of the move by the influential youth league of the governing African National Congress (ANC). Its outspoken president, Julius Malema, was quoted by the Star newspaper as saying: &quot;South Africa voted in favour of imperialists, and we cannot smile about that. &quot;The ANC of Nelson Mandela would never have voted for the killing of fellow Africans imposed by our former masters ... How can they vote for the interests of the UN and the United States of America, a country which clearly wants control over oil reserves?&quot; The South African press has demanded what comes next. An editorial in the Times, under the headline &quot;Will west have to turn its guns on the Libyan rebels?&quot;, said: &quot;It&apos;s a no-brainer that, if the rebels are not persuaded to halt their advance soon, western powers, already accused by the Russians of siding with the insurgents, will have to target the anti-Gaddafi forces to save the lives of Tripoli&apos;s people. &quot;It is vital that decisive action be taken on the diplomatic front to pave the way for an early ceasefire, possibly including some sort of exit strategy for Gaddafi and his acolytes.&quot; In neighbouring Zimbabwe, the president, Robert Mugabe, has condemned African support for the UN. &quot;There is no reneging on the resolution any more, it&apos;s there, it&apos;s a mistake we made,&quot; he said. &quot;We should have never given the west, knowing they&apos;re bloody vampires of the past, all this room to go for our people in Africa and try to displace a regime.&quot; The Zimbabwean press and blogosphere have carried rumours that Mugabe&apos;s government sent troops to fight for Gaddafi and could yet provide him sanctuary if he seeks exile. Other African leaders have joined the criticism. The Ugandan leader, Yoweri Museveni, said: &quot;Using tanks and planes that are easily targeted by Mr Sarkozy&apos;s planes is not the only way of fighting. Who will be responsible for such a protracted war? It is high time we did more careful thinking.&quot; Of the Libyan rebels, he added: &quot;I would feel embarrassed to be backed by western war planes, because the quislings of foreign interests have never helped Africa.&quot; But in an open letter to Museveni in Kenya&apos;s Daily Nation newspaper, John Barri wrote: &quot;The views that you espouse for the west keeping its hands off Africa are the same that permits the daily atrocities that occur throughout Africa.&quot; David Smith Johannesburg", "publicationDate": "2011-03-30T18:10:33Z", "title": "Libya conflict: reactions around the world", "sentences": ["Shlomo Bron, a defence analyst at Tel Aviv University, said: &quot;We have not had any special problems with Gaddafi and so it does not matter who comes after him."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Sri Lanka", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "At last weekend&apos;s PEN International conference on writers in prison, a Sri Lankan journalist described how, during the Sri Lankan government&apos;s 2009 onslaught against the Tamils, the only safe way to get a report out was to switch on your mobile phone, rapidly type and send \u2013 and then, just as rapidly, switch off. And there was one other essential precaution to take if you wanted to stay alive: you had to make sure to keep on the move. If you didn&apos;t, the Sri Lankan military would use your mobile signal to fix your coordinates and bomb you. &quot;We don&apos;t need a writers in prison committee in Sri Lanka,&quot; he ended his speech, &quot;because in my country they don&apos;t put writers in prison. They just kill them.&quot; No wonder then, that Sri Lanka&apos;s Galle literary festival has come under scrutiny. A recent call by the French-based organisation Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res to boycott this year&apos;s festival was signed by a list of high-profile names that included Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy and Tariq Ali. The festival, they said, gave &quot;legitimacy to the Sri Lankan government&apos;s suppression of free speech&quot;. The festival organisers were quick to rebut this charge. Theirs was a private initiative, they said, privately funded, and, rather than suppressing speech, it provided a forum for discussion. The opening session of this year&apos;s festival, titled After Shock, was a debate about the legacy of civil wars, including Sri Lanka&apos;s. The festival organisers seemed to have won the argument: among the invitees from all over the world, South Africa&apos;s Damon Galgut was the lone boycotter. Calls for cultural boycotts such as this one pose a special challenge for me. I am, after all, the new president of English PEN, whose work is focused not only on the defence of persecuted writers but also on the expansion of cultural engagement. At the same time I am a product of my South African heritage and of an early political engagement framed by the boycotts that helped to bring down the apartheid regime. I lived through so many years of boycotting South Africa that I had to train myself out of the habit of rejecting Outspan oranges. And it wasn&apos;t only South African goods we shunned. There was rugby and cricket, with the worldwide Stop the Tour protests that hit sports-mad white South Africa where it really hurt. And there were cultural boycotts that saw actors refusing to play on segregated stages, writers refusing to go on tour, and academics refusing inter-university collaborations. When, at his inauguration as president, Nelson Mandela articulated his country&apos;s relief that it would no longer be the &quot;skunk&quot; of the world, it was a sign that these boycotts had, in their own small way, helped to make the change. So I was uneasy during a recent Radio 4 Front Row programme, when I was booked to discuss the issue of cultural engagement and boycott with the Sri Lankan writer and artist Roma Tearne. Ours was the most sisterly of debates. We started out on the Galle Festival, with Tearne arguing that, although she wouldn&apos;t stop writers from going, she would never go herself because there would be no space for open discussion. I, who had been to Galle the previous year, countered with my experience of an audience \u2013 albeit an elite audience, as is the case for most literary festivals \u2013 that was ravenous to talk politics and, in particular, to talk Sri Lankan politics. And then, inevitably, our conversation turned to Ian McEwan. McEwan had recently been awarded the Jerusalem prize, given to writers whose work deals with themes of individual freedom in society. Like Margaret Atwood, who had previously ignored appeals not to accept the Dan David prize that was given by Tel Aviv University, McEwan refused calls to boycott his prize, choosing instead to weave into his acceptance speech an acknowledgment of the injustice of the evictions, demolitions and purchases of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and to donate money to an organisation that brings together Israeli and Palestinian former fighters. As we discussed McEwan&apos;s decision, Tearne and I switched sides. She supported McEwan&apos;s decision and I demurred. To my mind, accepting a prize from Jerusalem&apos;s mayor, Nir Barkat, who has presided over the evictions, demolitions and compulsory purchases that McEwan condemned, risked normalising these policies. McEwan had struck a blow for freedom of expression, and yet, if that expression is used by others to justify the unjustifiable, how free then is it? Tearne and I are not the only ones to puzzle over the complexities of the issue. As they walked me to the lift, the show&apos;s producers said they&apos;d had trouble finding writers to discuss the subject on air, not only because writers never like criticising other writers, but because many of us find ourselves pulled in conflicting directions. The call for the Galle boycott, for example, gained strength during the Jaipur literary festival. Yet if Galle is to be boycotted because of the Sri Lankan government&apos;s abuse of human rights, then do India&apos;s actions in Kashmir make Jaipur a suitable case for boycott? Does the exploitation of workers in Dubai make its film festival a no-go area? Does Blair&apos;s decision to go to war in Iraq mean that England&apos;s many literary events should be shunned? A week tomorrow I will be debating the issue with Rachel Holmes and Romesh Gunesekera during PEN&apos;s Free the Word festival in London. The South African cultural boycott didn&apos;t happen in a vacuum. It was called for by the African National Congress, which represented the majority of South Africans, and it ran alongside a United Nations condemnation of apartheid, a worldwide protest movement and economic sanctions. That, it seems to me, is the way to go. It is easy enough to embarrass a writer \u2013 many of us feel keenly the injustices around us \u2013 into making a grand gesture.

Her black hair is cut in an uncompromising pudding bowl and her skin is as pale as an oyster shell. She looks small and delicate, almost child-like, but when she starts talking about music, she launches fluently into extended semi-philosophical monologues on the nature of art, referencing everything from film noir to Chopin. The overall effect is somewhat incongruous, like a bush-baby delivering a university lecture. &quot;My music is much easier to explain as a picture,&quot; she says, midway through one such monologue. &quot;All the arrangements, textures, all the colours and the way you mix them\u2026 It&apos;s frequencies instead of pigments.&quot; She laughs, semi-apologetic, and drinks her black coffee. &quot;I know it sounds very\u00a0pretentious.&quot; For the past 12 years Keren Ann has quietly been releasing highly acclaimed albums and building up a devoted niche fanbase. Her meticulously crafted songs, at once languorous and eerie, led to her being described as &quot;Norah Jones for Velvet Underground fans&quot;, and her eponymous 2007 album was variously hailed by critics as &quot;exquisite&quot;, &quot;spine-tingling&quot; and &quot;intoxicating&quot;. Her songs have featured in films, advertising campaigns and TV series, most notably Grey&apos;s Anatomy and Six Feet Under. (She says she turns down requests all the time: &quot;I said no to a shampoo advert recently because the visual wasn&apos;t interesting.&quot;) And yet, for all her success, the half-Dutch, half-Israeli singer has never received the mainstream recognition she deserves. Now, at 37, that seems about to change. Her sixth studio album, 101, features lyrically sophisticated songs brought to life with a staggering array of instrumentation \u2013 choirs, string sections, horns, synths and pianos \u2013 that still retains the cool, controlled, noirish style that has become her trademark. Despite the self-consciously detached sound, her subject matter has an extremely personal resonance. The friction between the two elements proves strangely addictive, if unsettling, to listen to. &quot;I only write about things I&apos;ve known or experienced,&quot; she explains. &quot;About love, loss, detachment, attachment. It will always be something I went through but I will use a narrative to make it more fun. The most important thing when you write is to be honest about what you&apos;re saying.&quot; In the four years since her last album, her father, Dan, died of cancer. &quot;The mourning started way before he died because he knew he was going,&quot; she says, her voice quiet and toneless. &quot;He died in my arms, in his sleep. I was very close to my dad but this is not a mourning record. It was very hard to lose him but there were some beautiful moments before he left\u2026 I don&apos;t do mourning music. It [the sadness] is all in the composition. I don&apos;t think I can deliver in my voice something that is sad and needy. It&apos;s not in my personality.&quot; Instead the influence of her father, a Russian-Israeli sculptor-turned-businessman, is felt in the lyrics of tracks such as &quot;You Were on Fire&quot;, which is filled with dream-like abstract imagery of a pseudo-religious experience. &quot;In that song I wanted something devoted but not necessarily religious,&quot; Keren Ann explains. &quot;I went from taking care of my father in the hospital to being in the studio, taking care of my [music] arrangements. Sometimes I had to close the doors, turn off the phone and go into the music and let it do its thing.&quot; Does she think she is melancholic? She nods, her hair quivering. &quot;What attracts me in general is melancholy in every form of art. With classical music, for me it&apos;s always been more Chopin and Ravel than Mozart\u2026 but I&apos;m not at all tortured. I have my dark moments but I don&apos;t blame the world.&quot; She smiles, her red-painted lips splitting like fruit. &quot;I would if I took a lot of drugs \u2013 you end up blaming the world for your suffering; chemicals have that effect. But luckily I&apos;d rather have good food, good wine with friends. In the studio I can be the darkest person in the world but I don&apos;t take it outside. I think that&apos;s the woman&apos;s way of doing things. They have maternal instincts but they know how to separate being the mother and the child, the dependent and the one who&apos;s in control.&quot; She says she is &quot;fully satisfied&quot; by her work and has, for the past three years, been happily married to Ross, an Israeli man with whom she &quot;definitely&quot; wants to have children. Such positivity is refreshing, especially from an artist who has spent more than a decade being plagued by the &quot;up and coming&quot; tag. &quot;I hope this album helps create a buzz,&quot; she admits. &quot;You never really know, it&apos;s just timing... I know I have true fans because otherwise I wouldn&apos;t be able to tour, but it was all kind of underground. Every musician wants more recognition. I think I&apos;m ready for it.&quot; Part of the reason it has taken so long for Keren Ann to break through is that she defies easy categorisation. The youngest of three siblings, she speaks four languages after a childhood spent in Israel, the Netherlands (where her mother, Gerda, was from) and France (where the family eventually chose to settle). The nomadic impulse has stayed with her \u2013 &quot;I have a constant need to be attached and detached from places&quot; \u2013 and she currently splits her time between New York, Paris and Tel Aviv. Her early musical experiences, too, have proved lastingly influential. &quot;Growing up, I was listening to Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen. My dad listened to crooners like Sinatra, Chet Baker and Billie Holiday. My mum listened to Serge Gainsbourg, and I was attracted to his sound, the way he recorded the drum, the bass, the strings... it became obsessive for me.&quot; After leaving school in France, she took a series of part-time jobs to make a living while she wrote music, including spells as a waitress and a maths tutor. &quot;Whenever I liked a sound, I picked up an instrument. It was kind of natural for me because I wanted to do it so much.&quot; After two years she was living off her music, writing and producing songs for other artists as well as playing guitar in a local band. It was not until she was 25 that she started her career as a singer. She still keeps other projects bubbling away \u2013 in the past two years alone she has co-produced an album for the actor Emmanuelle Seigner, written scores for the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra and composed the sound design for a French television channel. &quot;I&apos;d managed to write some catchy songs for other people,&quot; says Keren Ann. &quot;And I thought, with this album, why not try that for myself?&quot; She smiles, her big, black-ringed eyes peeping out from underneath her fringe. You have to think that, after 12 years of hard graft, Keren Ann probably deserves to ditch the &quot;up and coming&quot; label once and for all.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-02T23:02:01Z", "title": "Keren Ann: happy to be melancholy", "sentences": ["The nomadic impulse has stayed with her \u2013 &quot;I have a constant need to be attached and detached from places&quot; \u2013 and she currently splits her time between New York, Paris and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/03/keren-ann-interview-101"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Booksellers", "Books", "David Grossman", "World news"], "article": "On the edge of the busy forecourt of Jerusalem&apos;s world-famous American Colony hotel, Munther Fahmi is in his usual spot; sitting in the bookshop that has become a haven of tolerance for scholars in a bitterly divided city. For 13 years, Fahmi has lined his shelves with works of history and literature, written by Arabs, Jews and scholars from around the world. Over that time, he has created what has been described as &quot;the only decent English-language bookshop in the country&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s the most enjoyable thing I have ever done in my life. It has been such a part of the life of Jerusalem,&quot; he told the Observer. &quot;I really did not fully appreciate how much until it was under\u00a0threat.&quot; The threat is real and imminent. Fahmi is due to find out in the next few days whether the Israeli ministry of the interior will order him to leave the city where he was born because, like many Israelis and Palestinians, he spent an extended period of his life abroad and his residency lapsed. Since returning from America in the 1990s, the 56-year-old has been living in Jerusalem on a succession of temporary tourist visas, which 18 months ago the authorities warned that they would not renew. His predicament has outraged two of Israel&apos;s most celebrated novelists, Amos Oz and David Grossman, who have signed a petition asking the authorities to allow Fahmi to stay. From the British Isles, Ian McEwan, Roddy Doyle and John Banville have also offered their support. Simon Sebag Montefiore, the author of Jerusalem: The Biography, came across Fahmi and his bookshop while working in Jerusalem. &quot;For me a bookshop is a sacred place, a temple which should be above politics,&quot; he said. &quot;Some bookshops have an agenda; Munther&apos;s does not. He simply celebrates books about the Middle East, Israeli writers, Palestinian writers. He&apos;s exactly the kind of person a country needs to be staying and running this kind of business.&quot; Grossman said that Fahmi was one of many Palestinians whose residence in Jerusalem was threatened by Israeli laws. &quot;He was born in Jerusalem, he has lived most of his life in Jerusalem and his family lives in Jerusalem. What is being done to him is an outrage. It&apos;s part of an attempt to embitter the lives of Palestinians so that they leave.&quot; Fahmi was born in the Old City of Jerusalem in 1954, when it was under Jordanian military control. After the six-day war in 1967, Israel annexed east Jerusalem. Like most Arab residents, Fahmi&apos;s family chose not to acquire Israeli citizenship. Instead they were granted permanent residency. As Israeli-Palestinian tensions grew, Fahmi decided, at the age of 21, to go to business college in New York and later set up his own insurance company in St Louis, Missouri. In order to maintain his &quot;residency&quot; in Jerusalem, Fahmi returned regularly but, in 1983, pressure of work kept him in the US and his permit expired. As he possessed a US passport, it didn&apos;t seem to matter, but 10 years later times had changed. In 1993 the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, shook hands in front of the White House. Palestinians and Israelis believed that decades of strife was at an end. Munther recalled: &quot;I was so optimistic, like so many people. We thought that peace was finally here. I didn&apos;t know what I would do, I thought I would just go to Jerusalem and figure it out.&quot; Fahmi noticed how hard it was to get English-language books. Many Israeli authors who wrote in English could not sell their books in their own country. &quot;I bought a selection of books and hosted a book fair in Tel Aviv. When that succeeded I took it to the American Colony hotel and fell in love with the place,&quot; he said. He opened the shop there in 1998. The American Colony is one of the few 19th-century landmarks of Jerusalem. The building was bought from a local nobleman by American pilgrims who eventually turned it into a hotel. For years, Fahmi had travelled to Jerusalem on a three-month tourist visa, leaving before it expired. &quot;I needed to travel for work regularly so it was easy to manage,&quot; he said. The authorities appeared content to let the arrangement continue, but have recently refused to renew his visa. Last year Fahmi lost a bid to win back his residency rights. An appeal was rejected, but he was given 30 days to ask the interior ministry to stay in Jerusalem on humanitarian grounds. The ministry is now considering his request. A spokesman said: &quot;We do not just decide to cancel someone&apos;s residency. They do it. If he makes an application to the ministry for residency on humanitarian grounds, we will consider it.&quot; Avi Shlaim, professor of international relations at Oxford University, described the treatment of Jerusalem&apos;s most famous bookseller as symptomatic of the &quot;chauvinistic and intolerant&quot; behaviour of Israel&apos;s current government under Binyamin Netanyahu: &quot;Things have come to a pretty pass when a Palestinian, born in Palestine, who has a business, who has done no harm to anyone, is hounded out of his bookshop because he does not toe the party line.&quot; Now Fahmi must wait. &quot;I have made no plans. I can&apos;t envisage leaving. I have a very sick mother who depends on me. I&apos;m 56; I can&apos;t start my life all over again. I&apos;m just hoping that this government will look favourably on me,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-02T23:13:00Z", "title": "Israeli authors join campaign to keep Arab bookseller in the country", "sentences": ["&quot;I bought a selection of books and hosted a book fair in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/munther-fahmi-jerusalem-bookshop"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "An Israeli actor and peace activist who ran a drama project in a Palestinian refugee camp has been shot dead by masked men, metres from the theatre he founded. Juliano Mer Khamis, 52, had received threats for his work in Jenin in the northern West Bank but continued to divide his time between Jenin and Haifa in the north of Israel. Witnesses said he was shot five times. Mer Khamis appeared in a number of Israeli films after his first film role in the 1984 production of the John Le Carre novel The Little Drummer Girl, about Mossad&apos;s hunt for a PLO bomber. He was born to a Jewish mother and an Arab Christian father. His mother, Arna, was renowned for setting up a theatre group in Jenin during the first Intifada which started in 1987. Mer Khamis directed the film Arna&apos;s Children, which celebrated her work, which he continued after her death in 1994. His wife, Jenny, a Finn, is pregnant with twins. She heard of his death from Israeli radio. Mer Khamis&apos;s body was transported to an Israeli checkpoint, from where it was taken to Tel Aviv for a postmortem examination. While his work was widely appreciated by Palestinians, his bringing together of young men and women angered conservative Muslim elements in Jenin. In addition to threats, fire bombs were thrown at the theatre. However the project was supported by local militants. Zakaria Zubeidi, a leader of the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, frequented the theatre as a child. Kadura Musa, governor of Jenin, said: &quot;He was a Palestinian citizen of Israeli origin. An actor and an artist but most of all a true human being. We don&apos;t know why this happened, but all the people of the camp condemn the death of this son of ours whose mother also did so much for the people of Jenin.&quot; Alaa Eddin Saadi lives next to the theatre, and said that Mer Khamis was shot while in a car also carrying his one-year old son and his nanny, who was wounded in the hand. &quot;I don&apos;t think he was killed because he was Jewish.

The Israeli Peace Initiative, a two-page document, states that Israel will withdraw from the land it occupied in 1967 in both the West Bank and the Golan Heights, and pay compensation to refugees. The document has been given to Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has said he will read it with interest. The authors of the document, which will be launched at a press conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, say that it is partly inspired by the revolutions that have taken place in the Middle East. It presents an opportunity for Israelis to participate in the &quot;winds of change&quot; blowing through the Middle East, they say. &quot;We looked around at what was happening in neighbouring countries and we said to ourselves, &apos;It is about time that the Israeli public raised its voice as well.&apos; We feel this initiative can bring along many members of the public,&quot; Danny Yatom, the former head of the Israeli external security agency, Mossad, told the New York Times. The group aims to generate public support for a peace agreement that will force the Israeli government to re-engage with the Palestinians, who have suspended meetings in protest at continued settlement building in the West Bank. Palestinians see such building as an attempt to create &quot;facts on the ground&quot; that obstruct negotiations. Yaakov Perry, a former head of Shin Bet, the internal security agency, said he hoped that the plan would galvanise the Israeli government in this time of change around the Middle East. &quot;We are isolated internationally and seen to be against peace,&quot; he told the New York Times. &quot;I hope this will make a small contribution to pushing our prime minister forward. It is about time that Israel initiates something on peace.&quot; The Israeli Peace Initiative recognises the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, which was sponsored by the government of Saudi Arabia, as &quot;a historic effort made by the Arab states to reach a breakthrough and achieve peace on a regional basis&quot;. The Israeli initiative endorses the Arab statement that &quot;a military solution to the conflict will not achieve peace or provide security for the parties&quot;. The initiative lays out the framework for peace agreements between Israel, Syria and the Palestinians. It calls for a sovereign and independent Palestinian state based on the borders between Israel and Jordan in 1967 but modified to ensure territorial contiguity for the Palestinian state. Some settlements would be placed under Israeli control. Compensation would be paid to refugees and their host countries by Israel and the international community, according to the initiative, but the refugees would be able to return only to the Palestinian state, with a few exceptions who would be allowed to return to what is now Israel. The plan also calls for a road link between the West Bank and Gaza, which would cut across Israeli territory but would be under Palestinian control. It also calls for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights over five years in order to achieve peace with Syria and a peace agreement with Lebanon. Dan Meridor, the deputy prime minister, speaking at an event in Jerusalem, said he had not yet studied the document. &quot;The paradigm is clear, that is a two-state solution, but the other elements should be negotiated, not dictated,&quot; he said. Referring to the uprisings elsewhere in the Middle East, he said: &quot;Some people say that we should wait for the aftershocks to happen, for everything to settle down, but I don&apos;t believe we can wait.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-04-05T16:59:04Z", "title": "Leading Israelis push for two-state solution with new peace initiative", "sentences": ["The authors of the document, which will be launched at a press conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, say that it is partly inspired by the revolutions that have taken place in the Middle East."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/israelis-push-two-state-solution"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "The US embassy cables", "World news", "US foreign policy"], "article": "Cable dated:2009-11-18T14:32:00 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 TEL AVIV 002501SIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 11/18/2019TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, PTER, KWBG, EG, IR, LE, ISSUBJECT: 40TH JPMG: COUNTERSMUGGLING TECHNICAL DISCUSSION (PART 2 OF 4)Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 1. (S) Summary: Concurrent to the Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) Executive Session, IDF J5 and Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) officers briefed U.S. JPMG delegation members on current arms transfers and weapons smuggling into Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. IDF J5 and IDI officers first focused on arms transfers to Hizballah in Lebanon via Iran and Syria, and provided current estimates of Hizballah arms. IDF J5 and IDI officers argued that Hizballah&apos;s ultimate goal during any future conflict is to launch a massive number of missiles and rockets daily into Israeli territory, including those that can reach the Tel Aviv area. J5 and IDI also described the sophisticated smuggling routes from Iran into the Gaza Strip, arguing that Hamas is now more powerful than prior to Operation Cast Lead. IDF J5 and IDI officers noted improved countersmuggling efforts by Egypt, but stressed more must be done to curb smuggling into Gaza. This is the second of four cables (septel) reporting on the 40th Joint Political Military Group. End summary. 2. (SBU) Israeli attendees included representatives from the IDF J5, IDI, Shin Bet, and Mossad. The U.S. delegation was led by PM Coordinator for Counter Piracy Robert Maggi, and included PM/RSAT John Schwenk, OSD Israel Desk Officer Eric Lynn, J5 Israel Desk Officer LTC Alan Simms, U.S. DAO Tel Aviv Assistant Air Attache Matt Yocum, EUCOM LCDR Molly McCabe, and U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv political-military officer Jason Grubb. 3. (S) Maggi stressed the importance of and noted progress with counter-smuggling efforts into Gaza -- but also acknowledged the GOI desire to see even further progress. He said the USG was looking for practical ideas to improve counter-smuggling efforts. IDF J5 officers argued that smuggling represents a strategic challenge for the GOI, which is facing a proliferation of knowledge and capabilities that are severely limiting Israel&apos;s diplomatic options for peace. IDF J5 made the case that weapons and knowledge proliferate from state actors, which disrupts diplomatic regional efforts. IDF J5 highlighted &quot;regional faultlines,&quot; with the United States and Iran leading two opposing camps -- and countries such as China, Russia, and Qatar remaining on the sidelines with unclear intentions. 4. (S) IDI officers briefed on arms &quot;deliveries&quot; to the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, making the case with the latter that these arms transfers were done openly and should not be considered smuggling. IDI noted that since 2006, Hizballah has increased its quantity of sophisticated arms with improved range and accuracy -- these arms were acquired via Syria and Iran despite the presence of UNIFIL and Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). IDI highlighted the continued desire by Hizballah to avenge the assassination of its former military commander Imad Mughniyah, and pointed to failed attempts to do so in Azerbaijan and Egypt. Finally, IDI reviewed the arms delivery route from Syria to Lebanon via the Beqa&apos;a Valley, and then to points south through Beirut. 5. (S) IDI presented estimates of Hizballah arms in Lebanon, including a breakdown of arms south of the Litani River. According to the IDI, Hizballah possesses over 20,000 rockets, hundreds of 220 mm and 302 mm rockets, several hundred &quot;Fajr&quot; rockets, hundreds of simple anti-tank (AT) launchers with rockets and missiles, and hundreds of advanced anti-tank wire guided missiles (ATGM), dozens of SA-14, SA-7, and QW-1 anti-aircraft guns, several Ababil unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), an unknown quantity of C-802 coastal missiles and up to thousands of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). 6. (S) Given this arsenal, Maggi asked what the IDF thought Hizballah&apos;s intentions were. IDI officers opined that Hizballah was preparing for a long conflict with Israel in which it hopes to launch a massive number of rockets at Israel per day. IDI officers noted in the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Tel Aviv was left untouched -- Hizballah will try to change the equation during the next round and disrupt everyday life in Tel Aviv. A Mossad official noted that Hizballah will want to ensure it can launch rockets and missiles to the very last day of the conflict, i.e., avoid running out of munitions. He estimated that Hizballah will try to launch 400-600 rockets and missiles at Israel per day -- 100 of which will be aimed at Tel Aviv. He noted that Hizballah is looking to sustain such launches for at least two months. 7. (S) IDI then shifted focus to the Gaza Strip, describing three circles of arms smuggling: 1. arms sources and TEL AVIV 00002501 002 OF 002 financing, such as Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and unfettered arms markets such as Eritrea and Yemen, and possibly China; 2. transit areas and states such as the Red Sea, Yemen, Sudan, Syrian, Lebanon, and Libya; and finally, 3. the &quot;close circle&quot; along the Sinai-Egyptian border and Philadelphi route. Maggi asked what percentage of arms transfers occurred via land, sea and air. IDI noted that it was difficult to determine: smugglers tend to prefer the naval route -- as there are fewer obstacles -- but the last segment almost always occurred overland. IDF J5 added that land smugglers are learning from past experience and building new overland &quot;bypasses.&quot; When asked about air routes from Iran over Turkey, IDI officials indicated that Turkey has been made aware of such activity, although a Mossad representative suggested Turkey may not be entirely aware of the extent of such activity, given the IRGC&apos;s smuggling expertise. The GOI highlighted that focusing solely on the last phase of smuggling (e.g. along the Philadelphi route) would only lead to limited success, and that wider efforts were key. 8. (S) IDI also provided an analysis of weapons entering Gaza following Operation Cast Lead. IDI noted that one of the goals of Cast Lead was to damage Hamas&apos; ability to produce its own weapons. In this regard, the IDF was successful, but Hamas is reconstituting its capabilities. According to the IDI, Hamas possibly possesses a few rockets with ranges over 40 km -- perhaps as far as 60-70 km, or within range of Tel Aviv. In addition, the IDI believes Hamas possesses quality AT systems such as the Kornet PG-29 and quality anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). These weapons join an already potent arsenal including Grad rockets with ranges up to 40 km, ammonium perchlorate (APC) oxidizer for indigenous rocket production, hundreds of 120, 80 and 60 mm MBs, dozens of mortars, C5 K air-to-surface rockets, PG-7 AT rockets and launchers, SA-7 MANPADS, PKS AAA MGs and thousands of rounds of ammunition, and quality AT, such as Sagger missiles and launchers, and light anti-tank weapon (LAW) rockets. 9. (S) IDF J5 presented some basic benchmarks for possible countersmuggling solutions for Gaza. First, Egyptian national commitment is required. Other benchmarks outlined by the IDF included a clear chain of command, control of the Sinai and its inhabitants, systematic treatment of tunnel infrastructure, trial and imprisonment of smugglers, and overcoming traditional failures such as bribery and lack of coordination. IDF J5 noted that Egyptian Intelligence Minister Soliman has been supportive, while there is growing awareness on the part of Egyptian Defense Minister Tantawi -- who the IDF views as an obstacle to counter-smuggling efforts. However, IDF J5 said there is a lack of coordination between the Egyptian Army and intelligence service on counter-smuggling efforts. 10. (S) The IDF has observed a more systematic response by Egypt in recent months, including assigning guards to newly discovered tunnel entries, or even blowing up tunnels -- by IDF estimates, the Egyptian Army has collapsed 20-40 tunnels in the last 4-5 months. Nevertheless, the IDF continues to see a lack of urgency on the part of Egypt regarding smuggling into the Sinai; little attention has been paid to improving the socio-economic conditions of Bedouins primarily responsible for Sinai smuggling. While Egypt has made several key arrests -- including prominent smuggler Muhammad Sha&apos;er -- others are still at large. Finally, the IDF noted the construction of an underground barrier and sensors&apos; network -- but in many cases, the smugglers have dug deeper tunnels to avoid the network. 11. (S) The IDF J5 outlined consultations with geology and tunnel experts, whom suggested several possible solutions to the Sinai-Gaza tunneling network: constant and specific mine activity in the vicinity of the border to a depth of 20-30 meters; the use of a shock device or stun charge, or smoke at a tunnel entrance for deterrence purposes; constructing underground obstacles 90 meters deep to destabilize current tunnel infrastructure; close supervision and inspection of buildings in urban areas, in which there is a high concentration of trucks and newly built rooftops and roads; and the arrest of major smugglers -- such as Darwish Madi -- and utilization of interrogation to discover major tunnels and dismantle smuggling networks. 12.

The revelations come in a tranche of the most militarily sensitive cables from the US embassy in Tel Aviv. They have been handed over to Israeli newspapers by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The Hebrew-language paper Yediot this week announced a deal under which it will print an interview with Assange, who has recently had to defend WikiLeaks from accusations of antisemitism. The cables show intimate co-operation between US and Israeli intelligence organisations. Israel&apos;s preoccupation with Iranian nuclear ambitions is well known and the US cables detail the battering on the subject that diplomats repeatedly receive from Tel Aviv.

Egypt is the primary route for weapons and munitions into the Gaza strip, and the US has been facilitating co-operation between Israel and Egypt to tackle this for several years. On arms smuggling across the Egyptian border to Hamas in Gaza, Israeli intelligence chiefs described as &quot;supportive&quot; Omar Suleiman, who was Egypt&apos;s intelligence minister, but said defence minister Mohammed Hussein Tantawi was &quot;an obstacle&quot; in a November 2009 cable. Another cable seen by the Guardian reveals that the King of Bahrain, whose Arab state has recently been shaken by protests, has had friendly links with the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. The cables report a private talk between the then US ambassador, William Monroe, and King Hamad of Bahrain in the king&apos;s palace on 15 February 2005. Monroe reported back to Washington: &quot;He [the king] revealed that Bahrain already has contacts with Israel at the intelligence/security level (ie with Mossad) and indicated that Bahrain will be willing to move forward in other areas.&quot; The cables also shed light on Israel&apos;s assessment of Hezbollah&apos;s mounting capability to strike directly at Tel Aviv with an arsenal of more than 20,000 missiles. Israeli intelligence chiefs briefed their US counterparts during a regular Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) session on 18 November 2009 about the scale of potential Hezbollah attacks from Lebanon. Washington was told: &quot;Hezbollah possesses over 20,000 rockets ... Hezbollah was preparing for a long conflict with Israel in which it hopes to launch a massive number of rockets at Israel per day. A Mossad official estimated that Hezbollah will try to launch 400-600 rockets and missiles at Israel per day \u2013 100 of which will be aimed at Tel Aviv. He noted that Hezbollah is looking to sustain such launches for at least two months.&quot; Other cables detail regular secret talks between the US and Yuval Diskin, head of Israel&apos;s internal security agency, Shin Beth, over the role of Hamas in Gaza. On 12 November 2009 the embassy reported the views of the general responsible for Gaza and southern Israel, Major General Yoav Galant, that Hamas needed to be &quot;strong enough to enforce a ceasefire&quot;. He told the Americans: &quot;Israel&apos;s political leadership has not yet made the necessary policy choices among competing priorities: a short-term priority of wanting Hamas to be strong enough to enforce the de facto ceasefire and prevent the firing of rockets and mortars into Israel; a medium priority of preventing Hamas from consolidating its hold on Gaza; and a longer-term priority of avoiding a return of Israeli control of Gaza and full responsibility for the wellbeing of Gaza&apos;s civilian population.&quot; Galant was to be made Israel&apos;s chief of defence staff earlier this year but the appointment was cancelled due to scandal.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-07T20:00:00Z", "title": "Latest WikiLeaks cables reveal Israel's fears and alliances", "sentences": ["The revelations come in a tranche of the most militarily sensitive cables from the US embassy in Tel Aviv.", "Israel&apos;s preoccupation with Iranian nuclear ambitions is well known and the US cables detail the battering on the subject that diplomats repeatedly receive from Tel Aviv.", "Monroe reported back to Washington: &quot;He [the king] revealed that Bahrain already has contacts with Israel at the intelligence/security level (ie with Mossad) and indicated that Bahrain will be willing to move forward in other areas.&quot; The cables also shed light on Israel&apos;s assessment of Hezbollah&apos;s mounting capability to strike directly at Tel Aviv with an arsenal of more than 20,000 missiles.", "A Mossad official estimated that Hezbollah will try to launch 400-600 rockets and missiles at Israel per day \u2013 100 of which will be aimed at Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/israeli-wikileaks-cables-julian-assange"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "The US embassy cables", "World news", "US foreign policy"], "article": "S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 TEL AVIV 002473SIPDISDEPARTMENT FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY STEINBERGE.O. 12958: DECL: 11/12/2019TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, MOPS, KWBG, IS, IRSUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT OF DEPUTY SECRETARY JAMES STEINBERGClassified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) ( d) 1. (S) Summary. Israel is deceptively calm and prosperous. The security situation inside Israel is the best since the outbreak of the Second Intifada, the economy has weathered the storms of the international economic crisis, and Netanyahu&apos;s governing coalition is stable, for the time being at least. Yet outside the storm is gathering and Israelis of many different political outlooks agree on the need to seize the initiative, even while they disagree about what exactly should be done. Israelis see Iran as the primary regional threat, both due to its nuclear program and its projection of power directly into Gaza and southern Lebanon. The Israeli navy&apos;s seizure of a ship loaded with a huge shipment of Iranian arms November 3 has provided tangible proof of Iran&apos;s involvement in arming Hamas and Hizballah. Syrian intentions are also a source of concern, as Israeli analysts see Asad moving closer to Iran and Hizballah even as Syria improves its relations with the West. The sharp decline in Israel&apos;s long- standing strategic relationship with Turkey is adding a new element of instability into the picture. Prime Minister Erdogan&apos;s rhetorical support for Ahmedinejad and his dismissal of the threat posed by Iran&apos;s nuclear program is feeding the sense here of impending crisis, although the robust U.S.-Israeli security relationship is profoundly reassuring to Israeli security officials and the general public alike. Finally, the failure to re-launch Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the political crisis in the Palestinian Authority is deeply disturbing to Israelis who still believe in a two-state solution. Even GOI skeptics are worried that the lack of a political dialogue and talk of a collapse of the PA are undermining the bottom-up approach they advocate as the alternative to a final-status agreement. Netanyahu insists that he is ready to start negotiations immediately without preconditions, but he will not negotiate on the basis of former PM Olmert&apos;s offer of a year ago. The opposition Kadima Party&apos;s number two, former IDF Chief of Staff and former Minister of Defense Shaul Mofaz, has generated considerable attention with a new peace plan that is based on offering the Palestinians a state with temporary borders in the next year or two, to be followed by intensive final status negotiations. Few here believe the Palestinians will accept this idea, but it may serve to push Netanyahu toward offering a peace initiative of his own. End Summary. Calm Before the Storm? ---------------------- 2. (S) Israel in the fall of 2009 is deceptively calm on the surface. Israelis are enjoying the best security situation since the outbreak of the Second Intifada, the result of Israeli intelligence successes in destroying the suicide bombing network in the West Bank as well as good security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority&apos;s security forces. The Israeli economy has successfully weathered the world economic crisis, with only a slight uptick in unemployment and no major impact on the financial system. PM Netanyahu&apos;s center-right coalition is stable, and faces no significant challenge from the opposition Kadima Party. Netanyahu personally enjoys approval ratings over sixty percent, and appears to have benefited politically from the media obsession with reports of frictions with the U.S. Administration. Netanyahu so far has managed the more right wing elements of Likud and other rightist elements in the coalition, although tensions with the far right are likely to reemerge over peace process issues, including a temporary settlement freeze or a decision to make good on Barak&apos;s pledges to evacuate illegal outposts. There are signs of a growing split within the Labor Party, and Foreign Minister Lieberman continues to face the strong possibility of several criminal indictments for money laundering and obstruction of justice, but none of this threatens the stability of the coalition, at least not yet. The latest polls indicate that Likud would gain three seats if elections were held now. And Looming Threats ------------------- 3. (S) Despite this good news for the government, Israelis are even more anxious than normal these days. Sixty-one years after the establishment of the State of Israel, Israelis sense a growing tide in the world challenging not just the occupation of territory seized in 1967, but even against the existence of the Jewish state within any borders. The GOI&apos;s alarm and outrage over the Goldstone Report was based on their view that the report represented an attempt to deny Israel the right to react military to terrorist threats. TEL AVIV 00002473 002 OF 004 Security is indeed good and Israel&apos;s borders are generally the quietest they have been in years, but it is common knowledge that Hamas in Gaza and Hizballah in Lebanon both now possess rockets capable of hitting the greater Tel Aviv area, Israel&apos;s main population and economic center. When discussing Iran&apos;s nuclear program, sophisticated Israeli interlocutors note that the issue is not just whether a nuclear-armed Iran would launch nuclear-tipped missiles at Israel - although that possibility cannot be dismissed - but rather the regional nuclear arms race that would ensue and the impact of the resulting uncertainty on Israeli elites and foreign investors alike. Israel&apos;s remarkable high-tech economy is a great achievement, but it also makes Israel exceptionally vulnerable to a host of private decisions to live and invest elsewhere. Growing alienation among Israel&apos;s twenty-percent Arab minority and the increasing domination of Israeli Arab politics by an elite that identifies with Palestinian nationalism further complicates Israel&apos;s internal scene. 4. (S) Painstakingly constructed relations with Israel&apos;s neighbors are also fraying. Even optimists about relations with Egypt and Jordan admit that Israel enjoys peace with both regimes, but not with their people. The transformation of Michel Aoun into Hizballah&apos;s primary Lebanese ally may be the final nail in the coffin of Israel&apos;s decades-old relations with Lebanon&apos;s Maronite Christians. Finally, Israelis are deeply alarmed by the direction of Turkish foreign policy, and see Erdogan and Davutoglu as punishing Israel for the EU&apos;s rejection of Turkey while driving Israel&apos;s erstwhile strategic ally into an alternative strategic partnership with Syria and Iran. Gaza Dilemmas ------------- 5. (S) Gaza poses its own set of dilemmas. The IDF general responsible for Gaza and southern Israel, Major General Yoav Galant, recently commented to us that Israel&apos;s political leadership has not yet made the necessary policy choices among competing priorities: a short-term priority of wanting Hamas to be strong enough to enforce the de facto ceasefire and prevent the firing of rockets and mortars into Israel; a medium-priority of preventing Hamas from consolidating its hold on Gaza; and a longer-term priority of avoiding a return of Israeli control of Gaza and full responsibility for the well-being of Gaza&apos;s civilian population. Israel appears determined to maintain its current policy of allowing only humanitarian supplies and limited commercial goods into Gaza, while sealing the borders into Israel. There are indications of progress in the indirect negotiations with Hamas over the release of Gilad Shalit in return for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of them hardened terrorists,but it is difficult to predict the timing of such a deal. Shalit&apos;s release would likely result in a more lenient Israeli policy toward the Gaza crossings, but a large prisoner exchange would be played by Hamas as a major political achievement and thus further damage the standing of Abu Mazen among Palestinians. Security Cooperation with the U.S. Reassuring --------------------------------------------- 6. (S) Especially given the sense of growing threats from all directions, Israelis from the Prime Minister on down to the average citizen are deeply appreciative of the strong security and mil-mil cooperation with the U.S. The U.S.-Israeli security relationship remains strong, as indicated by the joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense exercise Juniper Cobra 10 in which over 1,400 American personnel tested Israel&apos;s defense - and U.S. support thereof - against ballistic missile threats in the region . The United States remains committed to Israel&apos;s Qualitative Military Edge (QME), and has taken a number of steps to alleviate Israeli concerns over some potential U.S arms sales to the region, including the creation of four new QME working groups to further discuss these arms transfers. These working groups will soon begin deliberations, focusing on previous arms transfer agreements, mitigation measures for the planned U.S. F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia, technical mitigation issues, and intelligence policy. 7. (S) While the United States and Israel may not agree on some U.S. arms transfers to the region, these QME working groups will ensure a transparent process so that Israel is not surprised by any U.S. potential transfer. As it does in assessing all threats, Israel approaches potential U.S. arms sales from a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; perspective in which current moderate Arab nations (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and TEL AVIV 00002473 003 OF 004 Jordan) in the region could potentially fall victim to regime change and resume hostilities against Israel. It is primarily for this reason that Israel continues to raise concerns regarding the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia, especially if the aircraft are based at Tabuk airfield near the Israeli border. We have deflected Israeli requests for additional information regarding the F-15 sale until we receive an official Letter of Request (LOR) from Saudi Arabia. 8. (S) Finally, an argument can be made that Israel has continued to raise concerns over the F-15 sale as leverage in its attempts to modify its purchase of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Israel remains highly committed to the JSF as a successor to its aging F-16 fleet, although budgetary considerations have raised some doubts how Israel will be able to afford it. Nevertheless, Israel continues to press for the inclusion of an Israeli-made electronic warfare (EW) suite, indigenous maintenance capacity, and a lower cost per aircraft into its JSF purchase plans, and has repeatedly raised these issues with SecDef. Impasse with the Palestinians ----------------------------- 9. (C) Polls show that close to seventy percent of Israeli Jews support a two-state solution, but a similar percentage do not believe that a final status agreement can be reached with the Palestinian leadership. Expressed another way, Israelis of varying political views tell us that after Abu Mazen spurned Ehud Olmert&apos;s peace offer one year ago, it became clearer than ever that there is too wide a gap between the maximum offer any Israeli prime minister could make and the minimum terms any Palestinian leader could accept and survive. Sixteen years after Oslo and the Declaration of Principles, there is a widespread conviction here that neither final status negotiations nor unilateral disengagements have worked. While some on the left conclude that the only hope is a U.S.-imposed settlement, a more widely held narrative holds that the Oslo arrangements collapsed in the violence of the Second Intifada after Arafat rejected Barak&apos;s offer at Camp David, while Sharon&apos;s unilateral disengagement from Gaza resulted in the Hamas takeover and a rain of rockets on southern Israel. Netanyahu effectively captured the public mood with his Bar Ilan University speech last June, in which he expressed support for a two-state solution, but only if the Plestinian leadership would accept Israel as the ation-state of the Jewish people and the Palestiian state would be demilitarized (and subject toa number of other security-related restrictions o its sovereignty that he did not spell out in deail in the speech but which are well known in Wahington). Palestinian PM Fayyad has recently temed Netanyahu&apos;s goal a &quot;Mickey Mouse state&quot; due to all the limitations on Palestinian sovereignty that it would appear to entail. 10. (S) Abu Mazen&apos;s stated intent not to seek another term is widely seen here as an effort to put pressure on Washington to put pressure on Israel to meet Palestinian terms for starting negotiations. Abu Mazen&apos;s statements have likely reinforced his image among Israelis as a decent man, and certainly a different breed from Arafat, but a weak and unreliable leader. Yet even some of the Israeli officials, including Avigdor Lieberman and Sylvan Shalom, who have been most skeptical about the prospects for a final status agreement in the near term, are now expressing concern at the lack of engagement with the PA and the prospects of the PA collapsing. Advocates of a bottom-up approach are finally realizing that without a political process, the security cooperation and economic development approach will become unsustainable. Netanyahu has told us that he considers Abu Mazen to be his negotiating partner, and in his latest public statements has stressed that he is not interested in negotiations for their own sake, but rather seeks a far-reaching agreement with the Palestinians, but it remains unclear to us how far Netanyahu is prepared to go. Netanyahu is interested in taking steps to strengthen Abu Mazen, but he will not agree to the total freeze on Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem that Abu Mazen insists is a requirement for engaging with Netanyahu. Israeli Choices --------------- 11. (C) Former Defense Minister and former IDF Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz generated a lot of media attention this week when he announced a peace plan that calls for establishing a Palestinian state with temporary borders on sixty percent of the West Bank, then entering final status negotiations. TEL AVIV 00002473 004 OF 004 Mofaz&apos; approach is similar to ideas that have been floated quietly over the past few months by Defense Minister Barak and President Peres, and Mofaz claims that both Barak and Peres support his plan. Mofaz&apos; plan is in part an effort to undermine the political position of his rival for Kadima party leadership, former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. Livni, presumably drawing on her experience negotiating with the Palestinians during the Olmert government, says she opposes the idea of an interim solution, but instead supports intensive final status negotiations, perhaps this time with direct U.S. involvement. Livni and Mofaz both stress that they are motivated by a sense of urgency and that time is not on Israel&apos;s side. 12. (C) Netanyahu still holds the political cards here, however, and we see no scenarios in which Livni or Mofaz become prime minister in the near future. As Mofaz told the Ambassador earlier this week, Netanyahu may wait until the Palestinian elections, if they are in fact held in January, but the initiative is in his hands. If the Palestinians continue to refuse to engage on terms that Netanyahu can accept, it is possible that Netanyahu could turn his attention to Syria. Media reports that Netanyahu asked President Sarkozy to deliver a message to Asad may turn out to be accurate, but as with the Palestinians, Netanyahu will not resume talks with Syria where they left off under Olmert, but will insist on negotiations without preconditions.

Canadian-Israeli director Simcha Jacobovici&apos;s The Nails of the Cross is the veteran investigator&apos;s second film claiming to have discovered artefacts linked to Christ. He also directed 2007&apos;s The Lost Tomb of Jesus. But experts have poured scorn on the latest findings, suggesting that the film is little more than a publicity stunt.

Days after her removal from the UK, her traffickers tracked her down to the Moldovan village where she had grown up. She was gang-raped, strung up by a rope from a tree, and forced to dig her own grave. One of her front teeth was pulled out with a pair of pliers. Shortly afterwards she was re-trafficked, first to Israel and later back to the UK. The Home Office decision last week to pay her substantial damages has raised serious questions about the way Britain treats trafficked women. The unprecedented case also opens the possibility that other individuals who have been removed from this country and subsequently found themselves exposed to danger in their home country, could attempt to sue\u00a0the Home Office for damages. The Moldovan woman was first kidnapped by traffickers when she was 14, repeatedly sold on to pimps and other traffickers, and forced to work as a prostitute for seven years in Italy, Turkey, Hungary, Romania, Israel and the UK. She told the Guardian that British police need to do much more to protect women like her and to prevent others from being trafficked into prostitution. &quot;Just look around you - see how many girls there are like me. They are coming all the time. I see them every day - in tube stations, all made up, early in the morning. Maybe for you it is difficult to see them, but I see them,&quot; said Katya (not her real name), in an interview in her solicitor&apos;s office. &quot;I think the police should work better to stop this. Why don&apos;t you shut down saunas and brothels? Then there would be no prostitutes, no pimps.&quot; The exhaustive account that Katya has given in court documents, explaining how she was targeted, captured and intimidated, reveals the sophisticated methods employed by gangs trafficking vulnerable women from eastern Europe, Africa and the far east. It also reveals the danger that these women are often exposed to when the British immigration service opts to remove them. Experienced staff at the Poppy Project, which provides specialist support for trafficking victims and which last week learned it was losing its government funding, described her story as among the most disturbing they have encountered. Katya has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, but finds therapy sessions too painful to engage with. She was living with her mother in Moldova when two older men invited her and a friend to a birthday picnic in a nearby forest. Both girls were knocked unconscious, driven to Romania, blindfolded, taken across a river in an inflatable dinghy to somewhere in Hungary, dressed in dark clothes and made to walk through the forest across the border during the night, passing through Slovenia and arriving eventually in Italy. They were sold on to two separate men. Katya worked first in a flat in Rimini and then on the streets of Milan. After some months, she managed to escape and was sheltered for a while in the Moldovan embassy there, when she discovered she was pregnant. She chose to return to her family in Moldova to have the child, but her traffickers found her, beat and raped her brother and killed the family dog as punishment for her decision to tell Italian police what happened to her. She\u00a0discovered that the friend she had been kidnapped with had been murdered by traffickers in Israel who had drugged her and thrown her off a seven-storey building. These experiences terrified her so much that for years she avoided doing anything that might upset her traffickers in case they acted on their threats to hurt her family. After she gave birth, and sent her daughter to live in relative safety with an aunt, Katya was sent to Turkey to work in a nightclub. She was later smuggled in a lorry to work in a London brothel. During her time working as a prostitute, she was given no money for her work and was not allowed to go anywhere unaccompanied in case she tried to escape. Her clients in London rarely asked about the conditions in which she was working. &quot;The clients, they&apos;re drunk, and just come and say, &apos;Give me this, that&apos;. No one asks: &apos;How are you?&apos;. Some of them asked, &apos;Why do you do this job?&apos;, but I wouldn&apos;t answer,&quot; she said, explaining that she was afraid that if she appealed to them for help, they might turn out to be friends with the trafficker. She and the other women - mainly eastern European, none of them British - never talked of their circumstances among themselves. &quot;I didn&apos;t know if the other girls were friends of the trafficker. It was dangerous to speak to the clients or the other girls. There were speakers in the flat where we lived. We didn&apos;t talk about anything. Sometimes we were locked up for weeks and weeks, not going out.&quot; The brothel, in Harrow, north-west London, was raided a few weeks after she arrived. She was arrested, but she did not reveal the full details of her enslavement to the police because the Kosovan Albanian man who had bought her told her that her family would be in danger if she said anything. Because officials did not realise Katya had been intimidated by her trafficker, they allowed him to visit her nine times when she was in detention, visits he used to intimidate her further. Although they recognised that she had been trafficked, immigration officials decided to remove her to Moldova, judging that there was no real risk to her safety. A few days after she returned home, her traffickers found her. &quot;They took me to a forest and I was beaten and raped. Then they made a noose out of rope and told me to dig my own grave as I was going to be killed,&quot; Katya&apos;s court statement reads. &quot;They tied the noose around my neck and let me hang before cutting the branch off the tree. I really believed I was going to die. They then drove me to a house where many men were staying. They were all very drunk and took turns to rape me. When I tried to resist, one man physically restrained me and pulled my front tooth out using pliers.&quot; The attack ended only when her trafficker told the men they needed to stop as Katya was to be sold in Israel. &quot;I think maybe they did not kill me because I was more valuable alive,&quot; her statement reads. Katya, now 26, is thin and pale, but dentists have replaced her tooth, and her other scars are well hidden. &quot;I didn&apos;t have too many scars or injuries as the traffickers wanted to keep me looking pretty,&quot; she said. After working in Tel Aviv for a while, Katya again escaped before being trafficked to work in a central London flat, where her pimps sold her for \u00a3150 an hour; again, she received no money. In 2007 she was detained for a second time by immigration officials, who considered returning her to Moldova, before finally granting her refugee status. Katya has been interviewed by medical and trafficking experts in preparation for the trial, all of whom found her account credible. Her legal team argued immigration solicitors should have investigated evidence that she was a victim of trafficking and that their decision to return her to Moldova, where she ran the risk of retribution and retrafficking, was a violation of her rights under article 3 (the right to freedom from torture and inhumane and degrading treatment) and article 4 (the right to freedom from slavery and servitude) of the European convention on human rights. Paul Holmes, the now retired former head of the Metropolitan police&apos;s vice unit, CO14, said in a pre-trial statement that there was already much evidence by 2003 that should have led immigration officials to identify her as a trafficking victim. He said there was &quot;friction&quot; at that time between the immigration service&apos;s desire to remove &quot;illegal entrants&quot; to the country, and his department&apos;s desire to interview potential victims and get them to testify against traffickers. &quot;Our doubt about the effectiveness of prompt removal was exacerbated by the fact that our intelligence-gathering and operational activities had highlighted the fact that in some cases, victims that had been removed were subjected to retrafficking and were being discovered for a second time in London brothels or elsewhere within weeks of their original removal,&quot; he said. Katya&apos;s case was due to open last week at the high court in London, but Home Office lawyers agreed to pay substantial, undisclosed damages the day before the scheduled start of the case. Her solicitor Harriet Wistrich, of legal firm Birnberg Peirce, said she hoped the case would highlight the dangers of unlawful removal and could prompt other claims. Wistrich said she believed the case, which has been two years in preparation, might also educate people about the reality of trafficking of women from eastern Europe. &quot;People don&apos;t believe it&apos;s happening on this scale. People don&apos;t want to believe it,&quot; she said. There is no clear data to indicate how many trafficked women may be in England and Wales, but research for\u00a0the Association of Chief Police Officers last year found clear evidence of\u00a02,600\u00a0trafficked victims and of another 9,600 &quot;vulnerable migrants&quot; who might have been trafficked. The Home Office says there have been improvements in the way immigration officials deal with trafficked women since 2003, and minister Damian Green said: &quot;The UK has become a world leader in fighting trafficking and has a strong international reputation in this field.&quot; But Sally Montier, of the Poppy Project, said the charity was still regularly helping women who were wrongly sent home and retrafficked. She warned that 21% of the women who came to the charity seeking help had already been sent home and retrafficked at least once. &quot;Worryingly, we are seeing an increase in women who have been identified as victims of trafficking but who are in the process of being removed,&quot; she said. Last week&apos;s decision to award the Salvation Army the government contract to provide support to trafficked women would lead to the loss of the expertise built up by the Poppy Project over the last eight years, she said. &quot;We are very worried that we will see more women who are not identified as having been trafficked, and who are consequently removed, so that they fall back into the cycle of trafficking and abuse.&quot; Katya&apos;s traffickers have not been arrested and she is concerned they could now target her younger sister in Moldova. She plans to stay in the UK, has signed up for computer courses and English language classes, and is doing voluntary work. Recently she succeeded in bringing her daughter to live with her, but is troubled by the possibility that she could run into the people who forced her into prostitution in London. She is sceptical about the likelihood that the Home Office decision could force officials to treat trafficking victims with more sensitivity: &quot;If the government cared it would not be closing the Poppy Project. They don&apos;t care.&quot; But she adds: &quot;I&apos;m not angry with the government. How can you be angry with the government? I&apos;m angry with my life, the things that have happened.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-04-19T07:00:04Z", "title": "Katya's story: trafficked to the UK, sent home to torture", "sentences": ["After working in Tel Aviv for a while, Katya again escaped before being trafficked to work in a central London flat, where her pimps sold her for \u00a3150 an hour; again, she received no money."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/apr/19/sex-trafficking-uk-legal-reform"}, {"tags": ["Royal wedding", "Monarchy", "Prince William", "The Duchess of Cambridge", "New York", "Weddings", "US news", "UK news"], "article": "USA It was still dark when the party began in Manhattan&apos;s Times Square.

The area was surrounded by a maze of velvet ropes designed to give off an aura of exclusivity, but TLC staffers roamed the surrounding streets eagerly pressing &quot;invites&quot; into people&apos;s hands and urging them to &quot;join the party&quot; \u2013 which never reached full capacity. Permatanned TV host Randy Fenoli \u2013 whose day job is presenting a bridal show called Say Yes to the Dress! \u2013 stood on a dais and exhorted the watching crowd to cheer as the royal family beamed down from above. Off to one side stood three couples, waiting to get married on the show, and also Colbie Caillat, a rising pop star who had been booked to give a concert. The scene was slightly surreal, especially as noise restrictions meant the sound of the wedding was not broadcast. So the crowd gazed at silent giant images and listened in on tiny headsets handed out as they entered the TLC enclosure. That off-kilter feeling suited America&apos;s reaction to the entire event. While many Americans have an interest in the royals, they are seen as part of a wider celebrity culture. The interest is mild and polite, infused with an Anglophilia that still pervades many areas of American culture. It has its limits, too. Americans generally see royals as just another set of famous people and thus, at heart, not really that different from anyone else. The American media are another matter. The royal wedding has provided newspapers, magazines and TV stations with endless opportunities for saturated coverage and they have grabbed every one. TLC had been swamping its airwaves with wedding-related programming all week. Yet a recent survey in the New York Times showed just 6% of Americans were following the event &quot;very closely&quot; and a healthy 38% were not interested at all. That might explain the eclectic mix in Times Square. There were British tourists in hats and smart suits. There were visitors from other countries, too: a family of Russians and a pair of German backpackers. And, swaying slightly as they stumbled across the scene, there were people who had been up all night and chosen the royal wedding party as their last stop. &quot;I&apos;ve been out in every gay club in New York tonight and thought this would be the perfect way to end the night,&quot; said former model Shannon Killingbeck. Her friend, student Adrian Calderon, agreed. &quot;We are slightly wasted,&quot; he confessed. Then they stared up to watch Kate Middleton enter Westminster Abbey and gave a quick and brutal takedown of her fashion choices. &quot;That dress is so mid-last century,&quot; said Calderon. &quot;And where is the train? Princess Di had a huge train!&quot; complained Killingbeck. The atmosphere was somewhat muted. The weddings of the three couples, which took place after William and Kate had tied the knot, received only half-hearted applause. A segment of the crowd left after the royal pair said, &quot;I do&quot;, not even waiting for the balcony kiss. TLC used the event to promote as many of its own shows as possible. Flyers were handed out for a cookery show called Cake Boss and so were scores of copies of Brides magazine. But the TV channel was not the only one scoring publicity. Marni Halasa, a professional skater, rolled into Times Square wearing her own wedding dress. She turned circles and handed out her own flyers. &quot;I am here to entertain the public,&quot; she said, although she did admit that the day was meant to be all about the royals. &quot;I am excited to see what she was going to wear. But I think there has been a bit of overkill,&quot; she added. Kenya The empire has not breathed its last. That is the inescapable conclusion from the minor frenzy the festivities in London created in Kenya. Television stations gave the event wall-to-wall coverage; public screenings were held; and the newspapers billed the royal wedding as front-page material. The normally staid Daily Nation ran headlines such as &quot;What Kenyan men can learn from royal wedding&quot; and &quot;Memories of Diana at royal wedding&quot;. British cultural influence has not significantly diminished in the post-colonial era. The English premier league is followed obsessively in many parts of east Africa with replica shirts on sale in many stalls and the biggest clubs enjoying fanatical support. The British Broadcasting Corporation is a factor. It remains an important source of international news with the inevitable result that local views are shaped to an extent by the things the BBC gives prominence. It was to the BBC that many television stations turned for coverage of the royal wedding. Many offices, restaurants and pubs switched on local channels beaming the BBC newsfeed on Friday. Coverage of the nuptials gave way to interviews with local wedding organisers who predicted there would soon be royal-wedding-themed nuptials in the country and explaining why they had gone to great lengths to put on public screenings. One of them, Hope Mwinzi of Raspberry Weddings Magazine said: &quot;This is the largest wedding we are going to see since Princess Diana&apos;s way back in 1981 and we felt it was important for us to help local brides share in the moment.&quot; But not everyone found the entertainment to their satisfaction. One viewer, Jack Otieno, said: &quot;I like royal funerals better.&quot; Murithi Mutiga is a reporter and columnist for the Sunday Nation in\u00a0Nairobi The Israeli view Until I arrived in London eight months ago, the only queen I&apos;d ever got close to was a big-jawed drag queen at a Tel Aviv night club. Coming from a royalty-free country such as Israel, the British monarchy always seemed like a mix of tradition and soap opera. Not only have we no royalty, we barely respect our political leaders. The closest thing we have is Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister&apos;s wife, who has the mannerisms of royalty, if not the class. The British royal family is the only royalty beloved in Israel. People in Israel aren&apos;t really sure what duties the Queen performs, but they know she drinks tea and does sideways waves. Before long, interest in the royal wedding turned into an obsession \u2013 for my Israeli readers, but mainly for me. It was not just the marriage. All the hoopla surrounding the event helped me understand what Britons feel about the royal family. Over the following months I found myself in places I never imagined. I followed the Middletons and was asked to leave their property (&quot;Just been kicked out by the parents of the future Queen,&quot; I told my editor with pride). Standing in front of Buckingham Palace as their carriage passed me by, I felt envious that the UK has such a unifying institution. Had Israel remained under the British mandate after 1948, it could all have been different: royal weddings, good football teams and the Queen instead of Shimon Peres. Never mind. As I watched Kate enter the palace gates she took a big step into royal history \u2013 and I took a small step towards becoming a true Londoner. Yaniv Halily, London correspondent for Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel&apos;s biggest daily newspaper The Swedish view When I arrived as my paper&apos;s new London correspondent, I had my prejudices. One of them was that the British were so steeped in royalty that there would be no serious questioning of the monarchy. How wrong I was! But then came the ENGAGEMENT. No Swedish government would grant the people a bank holiday for any royal event. It would be deemed far too expensive and simply not Swedish. But, as I watched on Friday, I could not help being impressed by the beauty of the pageantry. The colours, the exact movements and the timing. The Brits are undisputed champions when it comes to putting on a spectacular show and the rest of the world can only look on with rueful smiles. Dan Lucas, London correspondent of the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter The Australian view Britain is an odd country for an Australian foreign correspondent to work in for the simple reason that it is not really that foreign. One minute of research on the Mall produced Kyla Hamilton, an otherwise rational 37-year-old from Melbourne who booked air tickets to London within two hours of the announcement of the wedding date and dragged her husband, Scott, along. &quot;Scott knows there is no third person in our marriage, but there is a third family, I&apos;m afraid,&quot; she shrugged. Your royals are our royals and the future of the Windsors has been more debated in Australia than here. The issue of a republic will be revisited before too long, and next time the monarchy will tumble, so the odds are strong that William will never be king of Australia.

Balhermep, the Ba&apos;athist concept of &quot;the ruling of the people&quot;, would keep his country together. But as demonstrations in towns and villages across Syria seemed only to be spreading last week, even as the regime intensified its crackdown, that notion appeared to be unravelling. The international consequences of regime change in Syria are many and complex. The fallout will be particularly marked in Lebanon and Palestine, and there will also be impacts on the country&apos;s alliances with Iran, Turkey, and Iraq, and, perhaps most importantly, on its relationship with Israel. Damascus&apos;s influence has always been strong in these areas. Syria is vital to Hezbollah, which leads a Lebanese coalition supporting Assad. Lebanon has no land borders except with Syria on the east and north, and with Israel to the south. To the west is the Mediterranean, swimming with battleships and an international force to prevent the smuggling of weapons. Hezbollah&apos;s links with Syria are, in turn, the linchpin of the alliance between Tehran and Damascus, for the party&apos;s first loyalty is to Iran and the supreme leader of its Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The fall of the Assad regime would mean the loss of Iran&apos;s only ally in the region and thus a weakening of the clerical regime. This could boost the enthusiasm of Iranian reformers, who have been sidelined and repressed since the disputed presidential elections in Iran in 2009. Damascus also hosts at least 10 Palestinian factions, most prominently Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Analysts say that Assad&apos;s tacit support comes not from interest in Arab causes but a desire to gather cards to play against the US and Israel in negotiations to win back the Golan Heights. The late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat and his successor Mahmoud Abbas consistently complained about Syria and Iran&apos;s interference in Palestinian affairs, which has always frustrated any reconciliation between Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Fatah, which controls the West Bank. The irony is that the reconciliation process has been reinvigorated by the signing of a treaty between the two rival factions in Cairo last week. Observers have noted this d\u00e9tente was only possible due to the distractions Assad faces at home. Now that the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood is leading the opposition movement at home, Hamas is reported to be looking for a new HQ elsewhere. Further east, Iraqi governments have long accused the Assad regime of facilitating fundamentalist attacks inside Iraq and say that Damascus harbours many of the dissolved Iraqi Ba&apos;ath party&apos;s former leadership \u2013 men Baghdad would like turned over for trial. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was the first to publicly scold Assad on more than one occasion for not taking his advice to reform. Turkey has recalled its ambassador from Syria for consultations and sent its head of intelligence, Hakan Fidan, to Damascus. There is no doubt that this reflects the Turkish concern that events in its close neighbour Syria may turn into a sectarian or religious war which would have a direct impact on Turkey. That fear was expressed by the Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Friday when he warned of the possibility of a mass exodus of Syrians fleeing a potential bloodbath. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, leaders in Israel fear the fall of Assad could lead to the rise of a conservative Islamic regime. An end to the fragile stability of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967, is a particular worry. Leaking of the news that Tel Aviv fears the Golan front could erupt again came as a surprise to many in the Arab world in light of the declared enmity between Israel and the Ba&apos;ath regime. With their allies in Egypt overthrown, Israel may not welcome yet more regime change so close by. Upheaval in Syria will not only affect its immediate neighbours \u2013 it will reshape the balance of power in the Middle East more than any event in the Arab Spring thus far.

Ferguson, then at Aberdeen, was approached by the north London club as the potential successor to Don Howe in the summer of 1986. Ferguson was coaching Scotland at the World Cup in Mexico at that point and regards only a delay in his decision as putting an end to the move. The Manchester United manager has spoken for the first time about the affair in Rangers&apos; match programme for their Tuesday night meeting with Dundee United. The game marks Walter Smith&apos;s last at Ibrox as the Rangers manager; Ferguson wanted Smith to assist him had he accepted Arsenal&apos;s advances. &quot;I was offered the Arsenal job and I wanted to take Walter with me,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;I had got to know Walter well by that stage and when I took over the Scotland job in 1985 when Jock Stein sadly passed away I made Walter my assistant with the national team. &quot;I thought I would sound him out when we were on Scotland duty together. We were going to play in Israel and I didn&apos;t know that Walter was going to Rangers at that time. So while we were in Tel Aviv I told him that I had been offered the chance to go to Arsenal and I asked what he thought.&quot; As it transpired, Smith was to move to Ibrox, initially as the assistant to Graeme Souness. Ferguson said: &quot;He [Smith] was positive about it [Arsenal], saying they were a big club and that kind of thing. &quot;So I said to him: &apos;Do you fancy coming with me?&apos; Then he dropped the bombshell that he was going to Rangers. I said: &apos;When did this happen?&apos; and he told me it was a long story but he would fill me in later. &quot;Of course I later learned that Graeme Souness had been lined up to take over and Walter was going to Ibrox with him. &quot;The thing about the Arsenal offer was that they wanted an answer right away but I couldn&apos;t give them one because I was going to the World Cup in Mexico with Scotland. So the Arsenal thing fell by the wayside. Walter went to Rangers and then later that year I went to Manchester United.&quot; Ferguson explained that he had aspirations of moving south at the time of Arsenal&apos;s approach, after a highly successful time in Aberdeen. &quot;I had started to get itchy feet,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt I had achieved everything I could with Aberdeen. I was a young man and I felt the challenge of England would be good for me. &quot;Of course I was offered the Rangers job in 1983 but I just felt having done so well with Aberdeen and having such a great relationship with the chairman, Dick Donald, and vice-chairman, Chris Anderson, it would have been a kick in the teeth to them to go to Rangers. &quot;So I felt the best thing would be to go to England and I always remember Dick Donald telling me that the only club that would satisfy me was Manchester United. Amazingly I was there five or six months later and I had no inkling about it.&quot; Ferguson and Smith were to be united in 2004, when the latter assisted the former for a spell at Old Trafford. At that time Carlos Queiroz had left United for Real Madrid but was to return for the start of the following season. &quot;I knew I was going to be bringing Carlos back because he was having a hard time at [Real] Madrid,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;I explained this to Walter in the January but I felt I needed someone in that run-in, someone I could depend on. &quot;I went to Glasgow to see him and he was delighted because he wanted to work. He did a smashing job and the players loved him and, of course, we won the FA Cup that year.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-05-10T20:04:11Z", "title": "Sir Alex Ferguson rejected 1986 chance to become Arsenal manager", "sentences": ["So while we were in Tel Aviv I told him that I had been offered the chance to go to Arsenal and I asked what he thought.&quot; As it transpired, Smith was to move to Ibrox, initially as the assistant to Graeme Souness."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/10/sir-alex-ferguson-arsenal-manager"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Syria", "Lebanon"], "article": "Israeli troops opened fire on pro-Palestinian demonstrators attempting to breach its borders on three fronts, killing at least 13 people. Scores more were wounded at Israel&apos;s borders with Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Clashes also erupted in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as Palestinians commemorated Nakba Day, the anniversary marking the 1948 war in which hundreds of thousands of people became refugees after being forced out of their homes. Thousands of Palestinian refugees in Syria marched towards the village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. At least four people were killed by Israeli troops as they crossed the border, Israel Radio reported. Up to 20 were injured, according to the Israeli Magen David Adom ambulance service. A statement from the Israeli military said: &quot;Thousands of Syrian civilians breached the Israel-Syria border near the Israeli village of Majdal Shams. &quot;IDF forces opened fire in order to prevent the violent rioters from illegally infiltrating Israeli territory. A number of rioters have infiltrated and are violently rioting in the village. From initial reports there are dozens of injured that are receiving medical care in a nearby hospital.&quot; Most of the inhabitants of Majdal Shams, a large village close to the border, hold Syrian citizenship and have family on the other side of the border, from whom they are cut off. The Israeli army declared the area, which is heavily mined, a closed military zone on Sunday. Despite being occupied by Israel for 44 years, the Golan is usually calm. Syria has repeatedly demanded Israel hand back the area. A similar Nakba Day protest on the Lebanon border led to four people being killed and around 15 wounded, according to Lebanese media reports. Dozens of protesters approached the border from the Lebanese town of Maroun a-Ras. Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai, an Israeli military spokesman, said soldiers fired when demonstrators began vandalising the border fence. The army was &quot;aware&quot; of casualties on the other side, he said. Witnesses said that Israeli troops had fired across the border at protesters throwing stones from within Lebanon, a move that could have serious repercussions and prompt further cross-border incidents. UN peacekeepers on the Lebanese side of the border appealed for &quot;maximum restraint&quot; to prevent casualties. In Gaza, around 60 people were injured by shelling and machine-gun fire when protesters approached the heavily fortified Erez border crossing, according to Palestinian medical sources. Israelis living near Gaza were advised to stay inside bomb shelters. The Israeli security forces were braced for wide-scale protests on Nakba Day \u2013 the most highly charged day in the Palestinian calendar \u2013 and had deployed around 10,000 troops and police along the country&apos;s borders and in the Palestinian territories. The West Bank was subject to a 24-hour closure, with only emergency access permitted. The Israeli authorities warned that the first Nakba Day following uprisings across the region could herald riots across the Palestinian territories. In the West Bank, rubber bullets were fired at about 200 Palestinians and supporters who marched towards the Qalandia crossing on the edge of Jerusalem. There was also unrest in East Jerusalem, fuelled by the death of a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot in the stomach during clashes on Friday. He died in hospital on Saturday. In Tel Aviv, an Israeli man was killed and 17 injured when a truck ran into vehicles and pedestrians. It was not clear whether the incident was an accident or a deliberate attack. The truck&apos;s 22-year-old Israeli-Arab driver said he lost control of the vehicle due to faulty brakes.", "publicationDate": "2011-05-15T18:01:00Z", "title": "Thirteen killed as Israeli troops open fire on Nakba Day border protests", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv, an Israeli man was killed and 17 injured when a truck ran into vehicles and pedestrians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/15/israeli-troops-kill-eight-nakba-protests"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Syria", "Lebanon", "World news"], "article": "Thousands of Palestinians and their supporters were embroiled in deadly confrontations with the Israeli army as protests erupting across the Palestinian territories, Israel and its borders with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan were met with live fire, rubber bullets, stun grenades and teargas.

It is a gloomy portrait of a dislocated family struggling to survive on the margins of a society which doesn&apos;t want them and unable to return to their home. &quot;I admit I am a traitor. I sold my people. But for what?&quot; says Ibrahim. His story is not unique, and not even unusual. A report last year by the Legal Forum for the Land of Israel estimated that 6,000 Palestinian collaborators and their families have moved to Israel but not been given adequate protection or proper status, and have essentially been abandoned by the security establishment to which they passed information. In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, the author of the report, Israeli lawyer Michael Teplow, said: &quot;There are literally thousands of threatened people who have been living in Israel for more than ten years with a special [temporary] permit but who are not allowed to work and do not receive health benefits. These people go through serious mental anguish every three months when their permit has to be renewed. They never know if they might be suddenly arrested [by the Israeli authorities] and returned across the border.&quot; Collaborators and informants are shown little mercy by Palestinian security forces. There have been many documented cases of collaborators being killed by mobs or subject to summary executions. Their families are forced to disown them, and even so are usually shunned by the community. Earlier this month, a Palestinian convicted of collaborating was executed by firing squad in Gaza. Under Palestinian law, collaboration is punishable by death. Israeli military intelligence relies heavily on informants, who are often recruited by blackmail or financial inducements. Ibrahim, the central character in The Collaborator and His Family, finds it difficult to live with the choices he made. And his wife and children, who didn&apos;t make those choices, find it even harder. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 12 hours from the time of publication but may close overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-05-17T07:00:06Z", "title": "Palestinian collaborator: 'I am a traitor.

Bob Dylan will celebrate with tribute bands, original works, intellectual debates and simple singalongs to applaud a man born as Robert Allen Zimmerman in St Mary&apos;s hospital, Duluth on 24 May 1941. In New York, the BB King Blues Club hosts tribute band Highway 61 Revisited, with guests including Rolling Thunder Revue violinist Scarlet Rivera and Never Ending Tour drummer Winston Watson, recreating Dylan&apos;s greatest hits. In Hibbing, Minnesota, the town where he was raised, the annual Dylan Days festival at the weekend, with music, art and literature, will showcase the place that &quot;spurred&quot; the young Zimmerman. &quot;With Bob Dylan turning 70 we are taking a year to honour not just his accomplishments but the creativity he continues to inspire,&quot; said Aaron Brown, Dylan Days spokesman. At the University of Bristol, &quot;The Seven Ages of Dylan&quot; promises to bring forth &quot;the UK&apos;s foremost Dylan scholars&quot; to assess his continuing capacity to inspire and infuriate. &quot;No one since Kipling has given the English language as many memorable phrases as Dylan,&quot; said Craig Savage, one organiser of the academic conference. As fans prepare their celebrations, fresh details of Dylan&apos;s turbulent life at the height of his fame in the 1960s have emerged. Interviews found by the BBC reveal the singer had been addicted to heroin and contemplated suicide. Opening up to critic Robert Shelton on a private plane after a concert in March 1966 in Lincoln, Nebraska, Dylan said he kicked a heroin habit in New York. &quot;I got very, very strung out for a while, I mean really, very strung out. And I kicked the habit. I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it,&quot; he said. Shelton first wrote about Dylan in 1961, publishing the definitive biography No Direction Home, The Life and Music of Bob Dylan, in 1986. The tapes of the previously unheard recordings were found during work on a new edition published for the singer&apos;s birthday. The recordings show that weeks before his 25th birthday Dylan admitted experiencing &quot;this suicidal thing&quot;. He said: &quot;I&apos;m not the kind of cat that&apos;s going to cut off an ear if I can&apos;t do something. I&apos;m the kind of cat that would just commit suicide.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;d shoot myself in the brain if things got bad. I&apos;d jump from a window \u2026 man, I would shoot myself. You know I can think about death, man, openly.&quot; Dylan held no hope that his songwriting would &quot;get me out of the fiery furnace&quot;, adding that it was &quot;certainly not going to extend my life any and it&apos;s not going to make me happy.&quot; But parties around the globe on Tuesday will pay testimony to the happiness he has brought others. John Butt, a former broadcaster, is hosting the only event listed in India, at his home in Delhi. &quot;Bob Dylan has been a constant figure in my life since I heard The Times They Are a-Changin&apos; in 1964, and the more I listen to his music, the more it means to me,&quot; he said. Having put his living-room event on Google&apos;s map of celebrations around the world, there was a danger that half of Delhi could turn up. Butt was not worried. &quot;If they do I&apos;ll welcome them in,&quot; he said. Dylan&apos;s message had particular resonance in India, he added. &quot;Dylan was always able to express his spirituality in a profound but very idiosyncratic way and I think that is in line with the way India celebrates the diversity of its spirituality.&quot; In Norway, fans are holding a Bobfest with quasi-religious fervour. &quot;Slow Train \u2013 the gospel according to Bob Dylan&quot; is being held at the cathedral in Toensberg, 60 miles south of Oslo. Thousands of miles away at the Chatkhara restaurant in Lahore, Pakistan, &quot;local Bobsessives&quot; will come together to &quot;share mixtapes and listen to Dylan&quot;. In Tel Aviv, Israeli artists including Yuval Banai, Yali Sobol and Noam Rotem will play Dylan hits in English and Hebrew on Tuesday night at the Barby Club. Dylan plays the city in June, his first concert in Israel since 1993. Event organiser Dror Nahun said: &quot;Most of the songwriters in Israel have been influenced by Dylan, he has a huge following. Dylan is celebrated wherever there are human beings, from China to America \u2013 he knows how to touch people all over the world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-05-23T23:01:02Z", "title": "Bob Dylan at 70: fans celebrate but interview tapes reveal a dark episode", "sentences": ["In Tel Aviv, Israeli artists including Yuval Banai, Yali Sobol and Noam Rotem will play Dylan hits in English and Hebrew on Tuesday night at the Barby Club."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/24/bob-dylan-70th-birthday"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "US Congress", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama"], "article": "Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has spurned American pressure to make a significant gesture towards peace to stave off international support for a declaration of Palestinian independence by telling the US Congress that the Palestinians want a country in order to continue the conflict, not end it. Netanyahu had been under pressure from the White House to outline immediate and practical steps towards peace after Barack Obama warned him that the US was increasingly unable to shield it from growing frustration over what is seen as Israel&apos;s intransigence. But while Israeli officials had billed the speech as intended to &quot;garner major international attention&quot; and shift the ground from under the Palestinians&apos; attempts to win UN recognition for a state at a vote in September, Netanyahu remained largely uncompromising. The Israeli PM told an overwhelmingly sympathetic Congress that it is the Palestinians, led by Mahmoud Abbas, who are the main obstacle to peace. &quot;Why has peace not been achieved? Because so far the Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a Palestinian state if it meant accepting a Jewish state alongside it,&quot; he said. &quot;President Abbas must do what I have done. I have stood before my people and I have said I will accept a Palestinian state. It&apos;s time for President Abbas to stand before his people and say: I will accept a Jewish state. Those six words will change history \u2026 With those words, I will be prepared to make a far-reaching compromise.&quot; Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of grandstanding for Congress, and said his demands for an immediate recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, rather than as part of an overall peace deal, was yet another obstacle to an agreement. &quot;What came in Netanyahu&apos;s speech will not lead to peace,&quot; said Abbas&apos;s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah. Netanyahu said he recognised that a peace agreement would require Israel to give up some of the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, known to Israelis as Judea and Samaria. But he rejected the contention that Israelis had no legitimate claim to the West Bank. &quot;In Judea and Samaria, the Jewish people are not foreign occupiers,&quot; he said, to a standing ovation. &quot;We&apos;re not the British in India. We&apos;re not the Belgians in [the] Congo. This is the land of our forefathers. &quot;But there is another truth. The Palestinians share this small land with us. We seek a peace in which they will be neither Israel&apos;s subjects nor its citizens.&quot; Netanyahu repeated assertions that he was prepared to make what he called &quot;painful sacrifices&quot; that would involve a partial pullout from the West Bank while retaining control of larger Jewish settlements that he described as suburbs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. He said Israel recognised that a Palestinian state had to be large enough to be politically and economically viable, but added that Israel &quot;will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967&quot;. &quot;Israel will be generous on the size of the Palestinian state, but will be very firm on where we put the border with it,&quot; he said. Netanyahu&apos;s at times belligerent tone is not likely to persuade countries considering how to vote at the UN on Palestinian statehood, particularly European governments. He said support for any such move would undermine not further the cause of peace. &quot;The Palestinian attempt to impose a settlement through the United Nations will not bring peace. It should be forcefully opposed by all those who want to see this conflict end,&quot; said Netanyahu. &quot;Peace cannot be imposed; it must be negotiated.&quot; Netanyahu addressed the dramatic changes in his region by saying that &quot;an epic battle is now under way in the Middle East between tyranny and freedom&quot; that &quot;holds out the promise of a new dawn of freedom&quot;. But he said the world should remember how quickly the hope of freedom was snuffed out after the Iranian revolution in 1979. &quot;The Middle East stands at a fateful crossroads and I pray that the people of the region choose the path less travelled, the path of liberty,&quot; he said. Netanyahu&apos;s speech, and particularly his emphasis on no return to the 1967 borders, was not only a snub to Obama, but a recognition that he has largely outmanoeuvred the White House in recent months. At Obama&apos;s first meeting as president with Netanyahu two years ago, the US president demanded an immediate halt to settlement construction as a first step to a swift and comprehensive peace settlement. The Israeli prime minister openly defied the pressure to the alarm of some in his own country, who feared that he could not afford to alienate Washington. But the stand paid off for Netanyahu. Obama has since backed away from the demand on settlements. The resignation of Obama&apos;s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, this month marks the reemergence of a traditional and more cautious White House approach to the conflict. Mitchell had pressed the administration to outline its own plan for a peace settlement if there was no progress between the two sides, a strategy that initially won favour among senior officials keen to break the deadlock that permitted Israel to continue expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and tightening its grip on Jerusalem. In Mitchell&apos;s place has reemerged his deputy, Dennis Ross, who has served three US presidents as Middle East envoy. Ross has been criticised as being too close to Israel. His deputy at earlier negotiations, Aaron David Miller, once described him as acting as &quot;Israel&apos;s lawyer&quot;. Bassam Abu Shareef, a political adviser to the last Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has said that Mitchell quit because of the &quot;extreme bias&quot; and obstructiveness of Ross.", "publicationDate": "2011-05-24T18:35:47Z", "title": "Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu tells US: Palestinians blocking peace deal", "sentences": ["We seek a peace in which they will be neither Israel&apos;s subjects nor its citizens.&quot; Netanyahu repeated assertions that he was prepared to make what he called &quot;painful sacrifices&quot; that would involve a partial pullout from the West Bank while retaining control of larger Jewish settlements that he described as suburbs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-palestinians-congress"}, {"tags": ["World news", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel"], "article": "     In the soft golden light of a late spring evening, as yellow flowers are beginning to bloom on giant cacti, Yacoub Odeh climbs up through knee-high grass to the ruin that was his childhood home. For a man in his eighth decade, he is surprisingly nimble as he navigates ancient stones that litter the ground. But behind his light step is the weight of painful memories of a lost youth and a fading history. &quot;Here is my house,&quot; he says, sitting on the remains of a stone wall in whose crevices wild flowers and saplings cling. &quot;Now only the corners remain. Here is the taboun [outdoor oven] where my mother used to bake bread. The smell!&quot; With distant eyes, he describes an idyllic childhood in a place he calls paradise, where families helped one another and children played freely amid almond and fig trees and on the rocks around the village&apos;s natural spring. The place is Lifta, an Arab village on the north-western fringes of Jerusalem, for centuries a prosperous, bustling community built around agriculture, traditional embroidery, trade and mutual support. But since 1948, shortly before the state of Israel was declared, it has been deserted. The population, according to the Palestinian narrative of that momentous year, was expelled by advancing Jewish soldiers; the people abandoned their homes, say the Israeli history books. Lifta was one of hundreds of Arab villages taken over by the embryonic Jewish state. But it is the only one not to have been subsequently covered in the concrete and tarmac of Israeli towns and roads, or planted over with trees and shrubs to create forests, parks and picnic areas, or transformed into Israeli artists&apos; colonies. Some argue that Israel set out to erase any vestige of Palestinian roots in the new country. Now, 63 years on, the ruins of Lifta are finally facing the threat of bulldozers and concrete mixers. A long-term proposal to sell the state-owned land for the construction of luxury housing units and a boutique hotel on the site is awaiting the authorities&apos; final approval. It has caused a furore. Opponents of the plan include those who believe Lifta should be preserved as a monument to history; those who want to retain its charming environs as a rambling spot; and those \u2013 Odeh among them \u2013 who insist that one day they will return and reclaim their homes. For many Palestinians, Lifta is a symbol of the Nakba, literally the &quot;catastrophe&quot;, of 1948 in which 700,000 people were dispossessed. It embodies their longing for their land, and their bitterness at their continued refugee status. It is, wrote Palestinian author Ghada Karmi in a letter to the Los Angeles Times, &quot;a physical memory of injustice and survival&quot;. The development plan was approved by the Jerusalem municipality five years ago, but earlier this year the Israel Lands Administration \u2013 the state agency that took ownership of Lifta&apos;s land under the Israeli law governing property deemed to be abandoned \u2013 began marketing the plot to private developers. A legal challenge stayed the tender process, but a decision is due any day on whether to proceed. The proposal is for 212 luxury housing units, expected to be advertised to wealthy expatriate Jews, a chic hotel and shops, and a museum. It suggests that some of the ruins be restored. But Lifta as a sanctuary and de facto heritage site will be lost.     Ultra-orthodox Jewish teenagers swimming in the village spring in the ruins of Lifta. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    Shmuel Groag, one of the architects of the original proposal, has since reversed his position and has backed the campaign to preserve the ruined village. &quot;I have changed my mind about conservation in general, and about Lifta in particular,&quot; he says. The site, he argues, should be &quot;frozen&quot;. Others have appealed to Unesco to declare Lifta a world heritage site, saying that work must begin to halt further decay and the theft of valuable stones from the ruins. Alongside the ramblers, drug-users and illicit lovers frequent the ruins. Crowds of ultra-orthodox Jewish teenage boys, stripped to their underwear, swim in the spring, and light barbecues on the rocks. Graffiti scars many of the fragmented walls. For Odeh, this is distressing. &quot;Why should they have free access to my home when I am stopped by security guards and questioned about my right to be here,&quot; he asks. &quot;When I see these people coming here, I feel sorrow and anger.&quot; The remains of the village are bounded by roads, along which traffic rumbles to and from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem&apos;s suburbs and settlements. On the ridge above Lifta, concrete mixers and diggers are at work on a high-speed rail link to Tel Aviv; deep in the valley below is a guarded complex, said to be the site of the Israeli government&apos;s underground nuclear bunker. Out of sight of Lifta&apos;s ruins, but built on its former farmlands are the Knesset (Israel&apos;s parliament), the supreme court, the Hadassah hospital, the Hebrew University and the city&apos;s central bus station. In 1948, the village owned 1,200 hectares but they have long gone, along with olive, fig, apricot, almond, plum, pomegranate and citrus trees plus the fields of spinach, cauliflower, peas and beans that gave Lifta its prosperity. &quot;Life was rich,&quot; recalls Odeh. &quot;The spring watered the village gardens. We had more olives than we needed so we sold them and the oil in Jerusalem.&quot; As we walk amid the ruins, Odeh points out the old landmarks. &quot;Here was the mosque. This was the sheriff&apos;s house. Here was the olive press. There is the house where I was born, and where my father was born. Over there is the cemetery. This was the sahn [courtyard] where people shared happy occasions and sorrowful occasions. Here I breathed my first breath. The first water I drank, I drank here.&quot; It is painful, he says. He points out what is remaining of the beautiful architecture of the houses, with arched windows, columns and graceful balconies. Over a door, a lintel is inscribed with Arabic writing. Enter in safety, it says; the owner of this house is God. &quot;The people of the village cut the stones and built their houses themselves. They were proud of that. They helped each other build and harvest the olives. The village lived as a family, one family.&quot; But in 1948, when Odeh was eight years old, the bucolic life of Lifta came to an end. At the gateway to Jerusalem, Lifta was strategically important to the advancing Jewish troops. A series of violent skirmishes caused fear and panic, he recalls. There was firing and attacks from both sides. And then came the day his family left. &quot;My mother was preparing a fire to warm the house. I was with my little brother. The gangs began to shoot in the direction of Lifta. My brother was shouting: &apos;Mama! Mama! They&apos;re shooting us.&apos; My mother took us inside and put us in a corner. The people of Lifta were crying to one another.&quot; Odeh&apos;s father, then 33, carried the youngest of the eight children, and the family crossed the valley and climbed up to the main road to Jerusalem. His mother took the key to the house but they left everything they owned. &quot;We had nothing but the clothes we were wearing. We had everything \u2013 and in one moment we had nothing. We became beggars.&quot; As the villagers left, Jewish soldiers blew holes in the roofs of the houses to make them uninhabitable. Odeh&apos;s father stayed in Lifta for a few more days. After boarding a truck heading away from the village, the rest of the family slept under fig trees. They spent the following two years in Ramallah before moving to Jerusalem&apos;s Old City. His father, a broken man, developed stomach problems and died at the age of 35. His mother suffered from asthma from the time she left Lifta until her death. Many of the 3,000 residents of Lifta scattered across the West Bank and beyond to Jordan, but a core still live in East Jerusalem within a few kilometres of their former homes. Odeh himself later joined the armed resistance against Israel and spent 17 years in prison. Now, in his twilight years, he is as impassioned as ever about his home. &quot;We will never forget nor forgive the destruction of our village. Lifta is in our memory and in our history. It is our fathers&apos; and grandfathers&apos; graveyard. The spring, the trees, the land \u2013 we will never forget it.&quot; He is unshakeable in his belief in the Palestinians&apos; right to return to their homes \u2013 something that cannot be countenanced by Israel because it would threaten the state&apos;s Jewish majority and hence its Jewish nature. &quot;We still dream of coming back,&quot; says Odeh. &quot;I&apos;m sure the time will come to return to Lifta, to my home.&quot; There can be no lasting peace until the refugee issue is resolved, he adds. But he knows time may be running out. &quot;Lifta is an eyewitness to history, to what happened in the Nakba. If we can&apos;t come back, then leave the village to this history.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-05-29T22:17:00Z", "title": "The ruined village Palestinians will never forget", "sentences": ["&quot;When I see these people coming here, I feel sorrow and anger.&quot; The remains of the village are bounded by roads, along which traffic rumbles to and from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem&apos;s suburbs and settlements.", "On the ridge above Lifta, concrete mixers and diggers are at work on a high-speed rail link to Tel Aviv; deep in the valley below is a guarded complex, said to be the site of the Israeli government&apos;s underground nuclear bunker."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/29/ruined-palestinian-village-lifta-development"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons"], "article": "Any mention of an Iranian nuclear weapon is taboo in the Islamic Republic, which insists that its nuclear programme is entirely for peaceful, civil purposes. So it is remarkable, to say the least, that an article has appeared on the Gerdab website, run by Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards, anticipating the day after Iran&apos;s first test of a nuclear warhead. Here is a translation of the text:  The day after Iran&apos;s first nuclear test is a normal day.The day after Islamic Republic of Iran&apos;s first nuclear test will be an ordinary day for us Iranians but in the eyes of some of us there will be a new sparkle.It&apos;s a good day. It&apos;s seven in the morning. The sun is not fully up yet but everywhere is bright. In the northern hemisphere many countries are beginning the day...The day before, probably in central deserts of Iran, where once Americans and some other Western countries wanted to bury their nuclear waste, an underground nuclear explosion has taken place. The strength of the explosion was not so great as to cause severe damage to the region nor so weak that Iranian scientists face any problems in running their tests.Today is a normal day like any other. Like 90% of the year, there is news about Iran, and these are the headlines which can be seen on foreign news sites:Reuters: Iran detonated its nuclear bombCNN: Iran detonated nuclear bombAl-Jazeera: The second Islamic nuclear bomb was testedAl-Arabia: The Shia nuclear bomb was testedYahoo! News: Nuclear explosion in IranJerusalem Post: Mullahs obtained nuclear weaponWashington Post: Nuclear explosion in Iran, Shock and despair in Tel AvivMeanwhile, the domestic media will offer many congratulations to the Hidden Imam and the Supreme Leader:Keyhan: Iran&apos;s first nuclear bomb was testedJomhoori-e-eslami: Iran successfully carried out a nuclear testIran: By order of the president, Iran&apos;s 100% homemade nuclear bomb was testedEttela&apos;at: Iran&apos;s much anticipated nuclear bomb exploded  This strange, hypothetical, article, which first appeared on April 24, hammers home again and again the message that an Iranian nuclear test will not lead to disaster. On the contrary, life will go as before except that Iranians will feel better about themselves.   The news commotion will not knock life in Iran off balance. Civil servants will punch in at work on time as always, while some will be late as always. ...The day after the Islamic Republic of Iran&apos;s first nuclear test will be an ordinary day for us Iranians but in the eyes of some of us there will be a new sparkle. A sparkle of national pride and strength.  This has the look of a kite being flown, but for whom? It could be intended to get Iranians used to the idea of a nuclear test, and less fearful of international reaction. It could be a gesture of defiance to the world by hardline elements - according to independent experts, Gerdab is run by the Revolutionary Guards&apos; cyber defence command, which is presumably still smarting from the Stuxnet attack. Opposition websites describe it as an enforcement tool for the regime, identifying and threatening independent bloggers inside Iran. The article comes during a period when Tehran&apos;s official stance is particularly defiant and assertive, announcing today that it will triple its production of 20% enriched uranium and shift it to the underground Fordow site, near Qom. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-Israeli expert on the Tehran regime currently lecturing in Colombia, described the Gerdab article as &quot;unbelievable&quot;.  I have never seen anything like this report. It&apos;s breaking a major taboo. For now we have to treat it as a one off. However if this report is followed by others similar to it, then it would signify a major change in the way Iran refers to its nuclear program. It would mean that Iran has decided to use the idea of a nuclear bomb as a deterrence against further sanctions and the possibility of a military attack by the West. It could also be a tool for the regime to boost its waning popularity at home.Such a change could prove to be very damaging in the short and long term, as it would be a significant boost for western efforts to isolate Iran and to consolidate the international consensus against the Islamic Republic and its nuclear program. Such isolation and deteriorating economic situation could be more damaging to the regime&apos;s top priority, which is its survival, than a military attack by the West.

One man had a python draped around his neck, a soldier in uniform carried a rainbow flag, and a young woman, almost naked, danced to the throbbing music, oblivious to the crowds and the searing heat. On Friday, thousands of people poured on to Tel Aviv&apos;s Gordon beach at the end of the annual Gay Pride parade in celebration of sexual freedom, tolerance and their city&apos;s ambition to be the most gay-friendly place on Earth. &quot;The weather is hot, the guys are hot, it&apos;s a hot city,&quot; said 28-year-old Amit Margalit, wearing turquoise shades and matching beads over his bare chest. The parade&apos;s organisers estimated that more than 100,000 Israelis, plus another 5,000 tourists, took part. Every square metre of shade was crammed, friends greeted one another with sweaty kisses and hugs, stalls selling ice-cold beer were doing brisk trade and traffic jams backed up around closed streets. Tel Aviv, in sharp contrast to Jerusalem, is a liberal, hedonistic and secular city, where leisure life revolves around beaches, cafes and nightclubs. Lonely Planet named it one of its top three cities in the world for 2011, describing it as &quot;the flipside of Jerusalem, a modern Sin City on the sea rather than an ancient Holy City on a hill&quot; and adding: &quot;There are more bars than synagogues, God is a DJ and everyone&apos;s body is a temple.&quot; The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rarely on the radar. According to Tel Aviv&apos;s 30-year-old deputy mayor, Asaf Zamir, 16% to 17% of the city&apos;s 403,000 population is gay. &quot;It&apos;s a very strong community here, a comfortable arena for the gay community. Two men walking hand in hand is a very normal thing,&quot; he said. The city municipality funded a gay centre and was promoting gay tourism, he added. Shai Doitsch, a spokesman for Aguda, Israel&apos;s national gay organisation, said lesbians and gay men were not confined to specific bars or clubs. &quot;We really are a gay city,&quot; he said. &quot;There are no special gay areas \u2013 if you are gay or lesbian, you are welcome everywhere.&quot; Pictures of lesbians were given equal billing to gay men in promotional material for this year&apos;s parade, the lesbian activist Anat Nirsaid said, adding: &quot;This is unique. If you look at most cities&apos; Pride publications, you always see men at the front.&quot; But there was still a need for campaigning in Israel, Doitsch said. &quot;We&apos;re not in paradise yet,&quot; he explained. &quot;Jerusalem is a very sensitive place. We don&apos;t expect to have gay pride parades in Mea Sharim [an ultra-orthodox area of that city]. Jerusalem hosts an annual Gay Pride march, which is a much more political event than the Tel Aviv celebration. Homosexuality is unacceptable to both ultra-orthodox Jews and Muslims.

This year&apos;s Academy award for best documentary was won by Strangers No More, which tells the story of students from the school, 70% of whom are immigrants, many from the world&apos;s most dangerous countries. On Monday, the film&apos;s directors, Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon, brought their Oscars to share with the schoolchildren and to allow them to bask in a little reflected glory. With 832 pupils from 48 countries, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, the children might not share that much in common, but one thing was for sure \u2013 they all wanted to get their hands on the Oscar. &quot;This is a tribute to the miracle that is Bialik Rogozin. The moment we came here, we found love and we are still in love with this school and everyone who has found a home here,&quot; said Goodman as the school celebrated with readings and awards while some of the girls nervously carried out dance routines, interrupted by the occasional misstep and technical glitch. &quot;If we received an Oscar, it&apos;s because these kids opened their hearts to us. All we did was capture it,&quot; said Goodman&apos;s co-director Simon. Many of the students face deportation and the government is due to make its decision on their futures. &quot;They might postpone it but it still leaves the kids living in fear,&quot; said Simon. In recent years, Israel has received 35,000 asylum seekers and refugees from across Africa. It also has tens of thousands of foreign workers who have overstayed their visas, some of whom have children born in Israel. Non-Jewish migration has created confusion in Israel. The ministry of the interior, headed by a minister from the ultra-orthodox Shas party, is keen to cut the numbers but others are proud that Israel has become a refuge. The film documents a year in the life of the school, focusing on three students: Esther Aikpehae, who fled South Africa after her mother was murdered; Johannes Mulugeta from Eritrea, who had not previously attended school; and Mohammed Adam, who walked to Israel from Darfur in Sudan after seeing his grandmother and father murdered in front of him. All three have temporary residence permits. The school is due to receive Israel&apos;s national education prize from the president, Shimon Peres, but headteacher Karen Tal pointed out it was not easy running a school where so many pupils were worried about their future. &quot;We have a deal with the pupils: we keep the routine and aim for educational achievement which will give them confidence at a time when they have no roots. The other side is that we are very active in agitating on behalf of the students. I speak to prominent people all the time and we have set up an action committee and hosted guests from all over the world,&quot; she said. Goodman believes the school is an example to others all over the world that struggle to provide good education in multicultural environments. &quot;How can you take kids from 48 countries and and educate them? The answer is, give them the right opportunity and the right atmosphere and they will come together and learn. Here, being different is the norm,&quot; she said. Tal&apos;s vision for the school and the country is of a society based on shared responsibility. &quot;In our vision, all students who come to Israel, whether they are Jewish, Muslim or Christian, have made a statement that they want to be part of that society and all that means. If that means military service or civil service, then that is part of our duty.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-06-20T16:33:48Z", "title": "Strangers No More celebrates Oscar win at Israel's melting pot school", "sentences": ["There&apos;s not much that is usual about the Bialik Rogozin School in Tel Aviv \u2013 so the pupils took it in their stride when the end of term was celebrated with two Oscar statuettes being handed around."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/20/strangers-no-more-oscar-israel-school"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Pablo Picasso", "Art and design", "Culture", "Museums", "Netherlands", "Israel"], "article": "It began as a joke, an outrageous idea to exhibit a Picasso masterpiece at a tiny art school in the occupied Palestinian territory. Slowly the idea gained traction, turning into a logistical and financial nightmare for its supporters and finally a triumph as Buste de Femme (1943), valued at \u00a34.5m, goes on show in Ramallah today. Thousands of visitors are expected to see the work, the first masterpiece to be exhibited in the Palestinian territories, although only three people will be allowed in at a time to ensure the humidity in the purpose-built viewing room does not damage the 100 x 80 centimetre oil-on-canvas work \u2013 a cubist deconstruction of a woman&apos;s face, dominated by grey hues. The painting&apos;s journey from the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven this week, at a cost of \u00a350,000 in insurance and transport, began when Khaled Hourani, the director of the International Art Academy in Ramallah, visited the museum in 2008 and suggested a loan. &quot;This started off as a crazy idea to bring a European masterpiece to a war-zone but I was only half-joking, &quot; he said. According to Remco de Blaaij, a curator at the Van Abbemuseum, staff began to take the idea seriously and work out how they could lend one of their works to a Palestinian gallery. It is relatively easy for internationally recognised museums to lend each other works of art, but the occupied territory is not a state and does not have a recognised museum. &quot;Insurance was one of the first obstacles. One company declined but another responded with enthusiasm. The head of the company travelled to Ramallah to see how it would work and returned determined to help make it happen,&quot; said De Blaaij. The insurance company required the normal safeguards: three guards in close vicinity and other guards nearby, camera surveillance, and temperature and humidity-controlled room. The academy had to build a room within a room, with a glass sliding door. But insurance was only one problem. Normally, Israeli customs would require a deposit of around 15% of the value of an imported work into its territory to ensure that it was not sold illegally. Buste de Femme has an estimated value of \u00a34.5m. After negotiation, Israeli customs waived the deposit. Earlier this week the painting, weighing about 5kg, was loaded into a 200kg crate, which includes a glass case, layers of protection and shock absorbers. It travelled from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, from where it was flown to Tel Aviv. From there it was moved with a police escort to the Qalandia checkpoint, a regular scene of confrontation between Israeli forces and Palestinian demonstrators, then driven for three miles without an escort through an area where Israeli forces rarely venture and Palestinian police are not allowed to operate. In Ramallah it was placed under Palestinian police guard. Once at the academy it was left to acclimatise for a day before it was unpacked, framed and hung. Hourani said that the Picasso was chosen by the art students and his mother. &quot;I want this to appeal to people like my mother and art students. Picasso remains inspirational because his work is related to war, peace and freedom.&quot; Hourani hopes that Buste de Femme will not be the last masterpiece to be exhibited in the territory. &quot;We want this to become a normality but it is the last time I will do it. It has taken two years to bring one painting but the taboo has been broken and it will be easier for someone else to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;The journey here adds meaning to the painting. It highlights issues of the freedom of movement and political agreement.&quot; The painting will be on display for a month before returning to Eindhoven, but not everyone likes it. Fatima Abdul Karim, the project co-ordinator, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a nice painting but it is a dream come true to have it here. Everyone has a different opinion about what the painting means. &quot;I overheard the security guards discussing it and they came to the conclusion that it was a woman cradling her child in time of war as she has one eye on the child and one eye on the surrounding danger.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-06-24T16:01:02Z", "title": "Picasso coup for tiny art school in occupied Palestinian territory", "sentences": ["It travelled from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, from where it was flown to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/picasso-coup-for-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Arts policy", "Society", "UK news"], "article": "There is a small piece of Cairo next to Johnsons the Cleaners in Folkestone, some Tel Aviv just down the road above Boots and some Copenhagen on the beach. All three are works of contemporary art for the second Folkestone Triennial, which opens on Saturday and will run until 25 September, featuring 19 artists from across the world. One hope is that people will find art where they least expect it: in the nave of a church perhaps or in a hotel billiards room long turned over to storage or an empty stretch of tarmac that even three years ago had a rollercoaster and a Ghost Train. The triennial is curated by Andrea Schlieker, who curated the first one in 2008. She said there had been a huge change. &quot;The first time round we introduced a project that seemed quite alien to many people \u2013 there&apos;s no museum or gallery here, no infrastructure to introduce people to contemporary art. There was scepticism. But this time we&apos;ve found such enthusiasm and anticipation \u2013 everyone wanted to be part of it. People could not have been more welcoming. It has really got under the skin of Folkestone and embedded itself into the town&apos;s fabric.&quot; One woman very much part of it is mother-of-two Georgina Baker, who won a competition to be The Folkestone Mermaid \u2013 a homage to Copenhagen&apos;s mermaid by artist Cornelia Parker. Baker was one of about 50 local women who answered the call to send in photos of them posing as the mermaid. She won and a life-size bronze statue was cast from her body in Ramsgate. She said she&apos;d used birthing techniques to keep the pose through the casting process. Parker said she had not been looking for a look-alike but &quot;a real person, a free spirit&quot;. The hope is that The Folkestone Mermaid will remain looking out to sea forever, like the tiny bronze teddy bear by Tracey Emin, still at the station since the last triennial, and the baby&apos;s hat on a bench outside Debenhams. The aim is that the Triennial allows people to discover Folkestone as well as discover art. This year it has been called A Million Miles from Home, a reference to the town&apos;s geographical location as both a gateway and as an isolated frontier location. Right down on the front is a station built so soldiers in world war one could get straight on to the boats over to France. It was still used three years ago by the Orient Express. Today there are weeds and peeling paint and a cold air of abandonment \u2013 and German artist Paloma Varga Weisz finishing a six headed sculpture which seems to have arrived on a carpet. In the nave of the pretty church of St Mary and St Eanswythe church when worshippers look heavenward, they will see around 70 colourful model boats hanging from the ceiling, courtesy of Hew Locke. Artists have taken over disused cafes, shops and offices. Hala Elkoussy evokes Egypt&apos;s brief colonial past on the same street that Smadar Dreyfus has installed an immersive audio-visual experience that she recorded in her native Tel Aviv. Some of the works will undoubtedly confuse.

An anchor moulded from the Stewart school of stand-up-turned-satirist, Saad Haroon&apos;s English-language (piss) take on the week&apos;s news is the first of its kind in Pakistan. But competition is fierce: Pakistan&apos;s current affairs shows have multiplied like gremlins in the last decade, fed as they are by late-night audiences greedy for &quot;newstainment&quot; pitched somewhere between Al-jazeera and The X Factor. Haroon&apos;s secret weapon is the comedy song (sample: the Roy Orbison-inspired Burka Woman \u2013 &quot;in your black sheet/ Burka Woman/ With your sexy feet&quot; \u2013 which went viral earlier this year) and giggly banter. Lots of it. Most likely to Shoot out rapid-fire gags about the war on terror (aka &quot;twat&quot;), corrupt politicians, and the national cricket team. Least likely to run out of news material. RICK MERCER REPORT     Rick Mercer.    Who Um, Rick Mercer Where Toronto, Canada Ther skinny Think Charlie Brooker without the hair, the venom, or the obvious lefty bias and you&apos;re maybe close to pinning down Rick Mercer. Something of an old pro at the satirical news show thing, Mercer is well loved, well known and well good, as the general consensus goes. Specialising in high-profile gimmicks and caustic but non-partisan attacks on Canadian politicians of every stripe, in recent years he&apos;s staged a sleepover with the prime minister and convinced one MP to go skinny dipping on national televison. Other sections of the show see him ambling around far-flung corners of Canada for on-location segments, striding down the street for his Rick Rants to camera, and persuading celebrities to offload their most useful tips to the nation. One such stunt saw Conrad Black showing the world how to press leaves with wax paper, just before he was jailed for fraud. Most likely to Egg a politician on to do something monumentally stupid.

Who Eyal Kitzis Where Tel Aviv, Israel The skinny Think one part Saturday Night Live to one part Ali G: Israel&apos;s equivalent of The Daily Show is one of the most-watched weekly programmes in national history. It features a long line of the country&apos;s best-known comedians and actors, routinely dicking about with spot-on impersonations, audacious group sketches, and satire so sharp it hacks a jagged path straight to the bone. Host Eyal Kitzis plays ring (and joke) master in chief, poking fun at one of the world&apos;s most politically sensitive nations without the least bit of tact. Kitzis operates an equal-opportunity approach to comedy: everyone is a target, nobody escapes attack. Recent \u2013 and very funny \u2013 skits have included the Angry Birds peace treaty and a schoolteacher trying to debate the Middle East peace process with a bunch of kindergarten kids (Teacher: &quot;So why is the world angry at us?&quot; Child: &quot;I think our problem is PR&quot;).

The best part of two years, in fact. Slightly lumpy sports presenter-turned-light entertainment star Oliver Welke (yes, the German answer to Adrian Chiles) steers the wagon to satire&apos;s usual suspects: the Americans, the European Union, with left-of-centre jabs at the Merkel administration. But the politeness of German TV debate and the country&apos;s lack of anything quite as crass as Fox News holds things back. On a set that reeks of 80s Granada, the suited-up Welke sits behind a beige desk while a giant blue graphic of the planet spins behind his head. The comedy is lighter, the barbs are gentler. Missing the two essential ingredients of bite and bark, it&apos;s satire \u2026 just without the funny bits. Most likely to Rely on canned laughter. Least likely to Make your sides hurt.

Bluntly ripping several shades out of national leaders has never been a common broadcasting pastime in Japan, but Ota swerves around audience sensibilities by setting (and sending) himself up as the nation&apos;s leader, pranking his way through office. Lampooning Japan&apos;s snoozing cabinet, its multiple prime ministers (six in as many years) and the country&apos;s submissive relationship with the US, Ota delivers quirky manifestos to a studio audience. Putting the world to rights, his &quot;policies&quot; are then debated in the show with actual politicians and entertainers. For all his breaking of new ground, though, there are still a few taboos left unbroken: finding funnies on North Korea or the Imperial Family are still a major no-go. Most likely to Play the fool.

He was three days into a visit during which he addressed public meetings in London and Leicester and the House of Commons when he was arrested and informed that he was the subject of a deportation notice issued on the grounds that his presence in the country was not &quot;conducive to the public good&quot;. What has made our government so agitated by his presence? Is it the fact that the sheikh was accused in some British newspapers and one website of making antisemitic statements, which he says were fabricated, and for which he has started libel proceedings? If so, the home secretary is applying a higher threshold for the public good in Britain than Israel itself applies to a man it has not been shy of prosecuting on other issues. Repeated attempts to outlaw the Islamic Movement for incitement have failed in Israel&apos;s high court. Mr Salah has not been convicted of antisemitism, and spoke recently on a platform in Tel Aviv University. This point was not lost on the far-right Israel\u00a0Beiteinu party, which, on hearing of Mr Salah&apos;s arrest in London, proposed a bill that could prohibit anyone convicted of aiding terrorist organisations from entering government-funded educational institutions. In apparently arresting Mr Salah for remarks he denies he made and which it has yet to be proved in a court of law that he did make, a British home secretary is being even more intolerant to the representatives of Israel&apos;s Arab minority, 20% of the population, than the state of Israel itself. Another Palestinian, Dr Ahmad Nofal, a professor of Islamic law at Jordan University who acquired a visa to visit Britain, was told at Amman airport that he would not be permitted entry. If the home secretary is unwise enough to start applying her &quot;prevent&quot; policy to all Palestinian activists Israel has a problem with, Britain will face a backlash in the Arab world. The prime minister Salam Fayyad \u2013 no Islamist himself \u2013 said Mr Salah&apos;s arrest would harm the Palestinian Authority. Both banned men are close to the Muslim Brotherhood, one of whose leaders, Rached Ghannouchi, lived peacefully in Britain for 22 years. Both Mr Salah and Mr Nofal were due to speak at an annual Palestinian festival in London. In a separate celebration, Jerusalem Day, rightwing Israeli activists marched into the Arab Old City shouting slogans such as &quot;Muhammad is dead&quot;, &quot;May your village burn&quot;, and &quot;Butcher the Arabs&quot;.

There is the right of return, the right of freedom of movement, the right to water, the right to education, the right to enter (not to be confused with refugees&apos; right to return) and so on. But the right to receive visitors, or lack thereof? This is the most recent addition. The prohibition on freely receiving foreign visitors is as disturbing as it is shocking, especially for a country that claims to be the only beacon of democracy in the Middle East. Yes, you read correctly. Israel is threatening to refuse to allow Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territory to receive visitors from abroad. We are not talking here about visitors such as the 5 million Palestinian refugees whom Israel has refused to allow to return to their homes after being expelled by force and fear when Israel was founded in 1948. Rather, the issue now is that foreigners who desire to visit the occupied Palestinian territory are being denied entry into Israel. Remember, there is no other way to get to the Palestinian territory of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which is under military occupation by Israel, except by passing through Israeli-controlled points of entry such as Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv or one of Israel&apos;s sea ports or land crossings. The entry point to the Gaza Strip from the West Bank requires passage through Israel as well. So, more than 300 international activists plan to arrive in Tel Aviv during the week of 8 July at the invitation of 30 Palestinian civil society organisations, to participate in an initiative named &quot;Welcome to Palestine&quot;. Delegations from France, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, the USA, Japan and several African countries are expected. Upon arrival at Ben Gurion airport, the invited guests, all from countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel, will make no secret of their intent to go to the occupied Palestinian territory. This nonviolent act, a civil society tsunami of sorts, only comes after Israel&apos;s restriction of movement and access to and from Palestine for Palestinians and foreigners has exhausted all established channels that carry the responsibility to uphold international law first and their domestic laws second. The greatest inaction has come from the US state department, even though it has put on record, multiple times, the fact that Israel is discriminating at its borders against US citizens. It is also worth noting that the 1951 Israel friendship, commerce and navigation treaty explicitly states: &quot;There shall be freedom of transit through the territories of each Party by the routes most convenient for international transit \u2026&quot; and persons &quot;in transit shall be exempt from \u2026 unreasonable charges and requirements; and shall be free from unnecessary delays and restrictions.&quot; So much for respecting signed agreements. Israel, as a state and previously as a Zionist movement, has gone to every extreme to fragment and dispossess the Palestinian people. It has had accomplices every step of the way, starting with Great Britain and continuing to this very day with the US and the flock of UN member states that act more like parakeets to the US than sovereign states when it comes to Palestine. Well, the game of inaction is coming to an end. When states fail, people take over. It is these people, like those coming to Palestine this week, or those attempting to reach the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip by sea, or those living in Palestine and resisting the occupation day in and day out, who will prove to historians once again that history is made of real people who have a keen sense of humanity and the courage to sacrifice. \u2022 Sam Bahour is one of the co-ordinators of the Right to Enter Campaign.

Israeli media reported that hundreds of extra police would be deployed at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv to try to halt the influx of protesters, who are part of the Welcome to Palestine campaign. Most are expected to arrive on an estimated 50 scheduled flights from across Europe, beginning at 1am on Friday. The campaign has denied that those participating intend to try to reach Gaza or provoke deliberate disruption at Ben Guirion airport. &quot;As stated \u2026 we invite international guests including families to visit us in Palestine,&quot; Welcome to Palestine said in a statement on Thursday. &quot;We hope and expect the Israeli authorities to allow them safe passage in compliance with international law and normal diplomatic relations. &quot;We also reject the Israeli government threat of mass deportation of peace activists and the attempt to justify this unjustifiable action with rumours that have been spread.&quot; Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has taken a personal interest in the &quot;flytilla&quot; threat, visiting airport officials before a trip to Romania and insisting that &quot;every country has the right to prevent entry of disrupters and provocateurs at its borders&quot;. Israel&apos;s public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, had already denounced those planning to participate as &quot;hooligans and radicals&quot;. &quot;The same hooligans who tried to break the law and disrupt the peace will not be allowed into Israel and will return to their home countries,&quot; he said this week. &quot;I want to make it clear that as a sovereign, democratic country, we will not allow public propaganda, incitement and illegal demonstrations to occur, not at the airport and not in any other place.&quot; In expectation of what has also been called the &quot;fly in&quot; Israel&apos;s transport authorities have demanded foreign airlines present lists of passengers two days in advance of departure for scrutiny. Israel expects at least 600 activists to attempt to enter, half of them from France. They have said they intend to spend a week visiting Palestinian families. Michael Rabb, a US pro-Palestinian activist, told Israel Army Radio he expected at least 500 activists to arrive at Ben Gurion airport and &quot;announce openly and honestly that we&apos;re flying into Palestine to visit our friends&quot;. Announced earlier this week by Welcome to Palestine, the campaign said that those taking part would include citizens of Britain, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany and the US. The &quot;fly in&quot; is the latest chapter in the continuing game of cat and mouse between Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters who have increasingly used tactics designed to challenge Israel and invite a response which would embarrass it in front of the world. Ben Gurion airport has long had a reputation for its stringent screening of arriving foreign passengers and questioning of departing non-Israeli nationals, including questions about where they have travelled and whether they have met Palestinians. According to the Haaretz newspaper, in this case Israeli officials have warned that if a plane arrives with a suspect on board, that person will be detained at Ben Gurion and be put on a plane back to his home country before he reaches passport control. Israeli authorities are also making arrangements for planes suspected of carrying larger numbers of activists to be diverted to an outer runway at the airport so passengers can be questioned. According to the paper, police being deployed for the operation were told during a briefing that &quot;when you enter the airport, it will be as if you are entering the set of Big Brother&quot; \u2013 and warned they should not be be goaded into using force and then being filmed by activists. The concern has been prompted by the international outrage that followed the release of footage of the Israeli commando raid on the Gaza aid flotilla ship the MV Marmara, a raid that resulted in the deaths of nine activists on board.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-07T13:25:51Z", "title": "Israel braces for Gaza protest 'flytilla'", "sentences": ["Israeli media reported that hundreds of extra police would be deployed at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv to try to halt the influx of protesters, who are part of the Welcome to Palestine campaign."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/israel-gaza-protest-flytilla"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Metal", "Linkin Park"], "article": "It&apos;s Thursday night in Moscow; Linkin Park are playing at\u00a0the premiere of Transformers: Dark of\u00a0the Moon at one end of Red Square, in the shadow of the Kremlin. The gig security consists of lines of military\u00a0policemen. Suddenly, screens begin showing nuclear explosions, and\u00a0the\u00a0giant, troubled face of J Robert Oppenheimer \u2013 the physicist who worked on the atomic bomb, then agonised over what he had created. As we hear him intone &quot;I am become death, the destroyer of worlds&quot;, thousands of Russian fans suddenly hold up placards, reading Wisdom, Justice and Love. The gesture \u2013 at an event taking place yards away from the seat of cold war power\u00a0for successive generations \u2013 is given\u00a0its power because it wasn&apos;t set up by the band, or their record label, or the film company, but by the fans themselves, virally, via messageboards. &quot;That totally threw us,&quot; says frontman Chester Bennington. &quot;I had that same thought, that here was an American band playing politically, emotionally charged music next to the Kremlin. I could feel the\u00a0weight of years growing up and being\u00a0told that this was an off-limits place.\u00a0So for\u00a0kids to express themselves in\u00a0that way\u00a0was really moving; something that we\u00a0will never forget, because it was\u00a0unbelievable.&quot; It&apos;s a conversation you&apos;d expect to be having with U2, perhaps, not a band whose\u00a020m-selling debut album, 2000&apos;s Hybrid\u00a0Theory, made them commercial kings of nu-metal, a genre synonymous with screaming rage and very loud guitars. But\u00a0today&apos;s Linkin Park drive hybrid cars, offset their carbon footprint and have taken a leftfield shift not unlike\u00a0the one Radiohead took with Kid\u00a0A.\u00a0A process they\u00a0describe as &quot;destroying and rebuilding the band&quot; led to last year&apos;s Rick\u00a0Rubin-produced A Thousand Suns, a\u00a0concept album about\u00a0human fears, including nuclear war,\u00a0featuring electronica and eerily beautiful songs such as Waiting for the \u00a0End. &quot;When you come out of the gate with a\u00a0record like Hybrid Theory, from a business point of view it&apos;s really dumb not\u00a0to keep on doing that,&quot; Bennington says, all smiles, his big, black earrings and\u00a0tattooed arms the only visual signs of\u00a0his nu-metal past. &quot;But we aren&apos;t a manufacturer. We are artists, and we&apos;ve gone philosophically back to where we were writing music before we sold a record. When we were excited about a song, not because \u2026 &quot; Rapper and multi-instrumentalist Mike\u00a0Shinoda butts in: &quot; \u2026 This is going to\u00a0be a hit!&quot; A week after the gig in Moscow, the pair\u00a0\u2013 whose double act provides the band\u00a0with its on-stage energy \u2013 are relaxing\u00a0in the Mandarin Oriental hotel in\u00a0London, where rock royalty often stay\u00a0when in the city. Friendlier and funnier than one might suspect from the\u00a0anguish of their music, they are as different from each other in person as they\u00a0are on stage: Shinoda dry and thoughtful, Bennington livewire and open. But just as in performance, they spark off each other incessantly. Linkin&apos;s reinvention has been very personal for\u00a0them both. Shinoda is Japanese-American. During the second world war, his Japanese-born grandparents, who had emigrated to the US, were among the 110,000 Japanese-Americans interned in &quot;war relocation camps&quot;. When Linkin were recording A\u00a0Thousand Suns, Rubin suggested Shinoda write lyrics by stream-of-consciousness, and he found years of buried family memories suddenly tumbled out. &quot;Because it wasn&apos;t just the war,&quot; he says. &quot;It was fear in their neighbourhood and everything, for years. My dad remembers being in school with my uncle,\u00a0and the teacher would say outright to the class that the Japanese were second-class citizens and shouldn&apos;t be trusted. Before the war my family had a grocery store and a barber&apos;s shop, but after\u00a0internment it was destroyed and they had to start again as strawberry pickers. But they won&apos;t talk about it. I wanted to tell these stories because nobody else will.&quot; Bennington&apos;s past is, Shinoda is quick to point out, &quot;more extreme&quot;. His parents&apos; divorce when he was 11 led him to start smoking pot, which led to cocaine and methamphetamine. In some previous interviews, he has alluded to sexual abuse\u00a0by an older male friend. &quot;When I was young, getting beaten up\u00a0and pretty much raped was no fun,&quot; he\u00a0says suddenly and disarmingly. &quot;No\u00a0one\u00a0wants that to happen to you and honestly, I don&apos;t remember when it started. But about four years ago I went to visit my mom and I saw a picture of myself\u00a0and I remember very clearly when\u00a0that picture was taken. All of a sudden, because I had kids, I looked at it and thought: &apos;Wow, that&apos;s what I looked like.&apos; And then I remembered. Oh my God.\u00a0I remember that\u00a0stuff happening to me at that stage and even thinking about\u00a0it\u00a0now makes me\u00a0want to cry. Oh my\u00a0God, that was fucking happening to\u00a0me\u00a0and I was just that little, much earlier\u00a0than I&apos;d remembered. My God, no wonder I became a drug\u00a0addict. No wonder\u00a0I just went completely insane for\u00a0a\u00a0little while.&quot; Bennington&apos;s trauma fired Hybrid Theory and 2003&apos;s hit follow-up, Meteora. The success they achieved was, for Bennington, &quot;like something you read in\u00a0a\u00a0book. It doesn&apos;t really happen. I\u00a0followed my own instinct because everybody else was fucked up, and I didn&apos;t like anybody else&apos;s thing, so therefore I\u00a0would do my own.&quot; Although Bennington had knocked around in music for a while before Linkin Park came together, when success came, it came quickly. They realised things were changing when the pair drove over to Bennington&apos;s dad&apos;s house and heard their song on the radio. &quot;It was the most surreal experience,&quot; Shinoda remembers, smiling at the memory. &quot;There were multiple radios and we were on every one. It was like, &apos;Holy shit!&apos; It was so cool.&quot; Bennington went from sleeping in the back of an old Toyota to fronting what was\u00a0then the biggest-selling debut album\u00a0of the 21st century. Fans blared music outside his house. One woman caused a car accident after spotting him in\u00a0the street. Bennington did not find the change in fortunes easy, and he fell back into serious drug abuse. &quot;Unfortunately, my ex-wife [Samantha, whom he married when they were so poor he couldn&apos;t afford a wedding ring] and I were really toxic for each other, too young\u00a0to get married,&quot; he says. &quot;We were volatile personalities, and even though we\u00a0helped each other, we were not good for each other, and that brought up other\u00a0feelings.&quot; &quot;The tours we did in the beginning, everybody we toured with was either drinking or doing drugs,&quot; Shinoda says. &quot;I\u00a0can&apos;t think of any that were sober. So you take someone who already has a hankering for drugs and \u2026 &quot; &quot;I partied with everybody,&quot; Bennington says. That didn&apos;t help build bonds with the rest of the band \u2013 who were more\u00a0into pot and booze, and had no idea their frontman would be sitting on the tour bus tripping. He says he knew what their response would be: &quot;Fuck, man. Look at what we&apos;ve got going here. What the fuck are you doing?&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the band who were kept\u00a0in\u00a0the dark. The early Linkin were a notoriously closed unit. Journalists would\u00a0return from interviewing them with tales of confiscated mobiles and monosyllabic replies. &quot;We talked about this recently, and realised we were super-defensive,&quot; Shinoda says. The speed of their success led to suspicions they were manufactured, and for Bennington the accusation that he\u00a0somehow &quot;wasn&apos;t real&quot; cut deep. &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;Fuck you, you don&apos;t know me,&quot; he spits, grinding a fist into his hand.\u00a0&quot;And personally I would want to jump across the table and fucking kill you. &apos;How dare you question what I&apos;m singing about?&apos; Eventually I thought: &apos;OK, you wanna know? This is where I come from!&apos; and I told a journalist things I&apos;ve never told anybody. And my dad \u2013 a policeman \u2013 rings me up and says: &apos;What the fuck do\u00a0you mean this happened to you when you were a kid? Who did it?&apos; And I was thinking: &apos;What have I done?&apos;&quot; Eventually, Bennington revealed the\u00a0identity of his abuser to his father. He realised his abuser had in turn been a victim and chose not to pursue him. &quot;I\u00a0didn&apos;t need revenge. I realised \u2026 &quot; Shinoda quietly finishes the sentence: &quot;That it can end with you.&quot; It did, but only after a lot of therapy. Linkin&apos;s metamorphosis began in 2007, when they hooked up with Rubin for the\u00a0tentatively experimental Minutes to Midnight, after Bennington had turned his life around. &quot;I&apos;d become a person that wasn&apos;t me,&quot; he sighs. &quot;This is me. I&apos;m a nice, friendly guy that was always stuck\u00a0behind this monster that was just really a hurt kid.&quot; Bennington got divorced in 2005 \u2013 his ex-wife, the mother of his first child, has since become a &quot;really great friend, and a great mom, and I regret every bad thing I&apos;ve ever said about her in the press&quot;. On\u00a031 December 2005 he married Talinda, a schoolteacher and former model. The relationship changed him, and with therapy, rehab and faith &quot;unlocked all these things that I&apos;d been carrying all those years&quot;.

It was the midsummer season of white nights, when the sun never fully sets, and we stayed at the wedding party till morning, wandering along the Moika embankment for breakfast at the Hotel Angleterre. It was all so different from when my husband Marc and I had lived here 15 years before, in the last Soviet winter of 1990 \u2013 the city&apos;s last as Leningrad \u2013 in the first-floor front room of 23 Pochtamtskaya Street (Post Office Street). Then the facades and entryways of Pochtamtskaya&apos;s low 18th-century houses were dilapidated, some to the point of ruin. Our room was large and warm, with a Bechstein grand and a theatrical gilt mirror that hung at an ominous 45-degree angle over the bed. Leningrad State University, where I was enrolled for six months&apos; graduate research, was (like the entire Soviet Union) in administrative paralysis in 1990, and unable to provide accommodation in a student hostel. Through friends, we came to a complicated barter arrangement (rent was still illegal) with a Russian opera singer who was doing a season at Covent Garden, and moved in with his mother-in-law, Irina Borisovna, who was in hibernation. &quot;Why go out? It&apos;s still dark!&quot; she would say. Pochtamtskaya lies on the far side of St Isaac&apos;s Square from the Angleterre. Marc and I would cross the square each morning and part outside the hotel. As the sun rose, I crossed the frozen Neva to look at archives in the literary institute, Pushkin House. Marc took the tram down Nevsky Prospect to Lenfilm, where he worked as a legal adviser, translator and &quot;voice-over&quot; (&quot;as an American robot&quot;, his employers insisted) for the studio&apos;s new English-language commercials. That winter, the Angleterre was closed for renovation. I longed for it to open. I imagined sitting in a comfortable chair, looking up at the angels on the roof of St Isaac&apos;s Cathedral, drinking good coffee from a clean cup. One week, a literary group gathered outside to protest against the gutting of the building. The poet Sergei Esenin \u2013 who called himself a hooligan \u2013 had hanged himself in room five in 1925, leaving a farewell poem written in his own blood. The poetry-lovers wanted the room preserved in his memory: beams, heating pipes, plaster. Street protests still had an edge of danger then, but when Irina Borisovna saw their earnest placards on the evening news she did not, for once, say &quot;hooligans&quot;. Food was rationed. Our Russian friends worried that we were hungry. I was embarrassed to tell them that for a couple of dollars we could buy enough to last us a week from the gold-toothed Caucasians at the market: fine cuts of meat, cheese, honey and fresh produce. When a friend brought a kilo of beef that her mother had stolen for us from her factory canteen, my embarrassment turned to shame. Irina Borisovna had many visitors. Old women who had worked with her late husband in the Party came to sit on the divan and watch TV. &quot;How will it all end?&quot; they asked each other. Their sense of apocalypse entered my sensibility and I wrote letters home that must have seemed half-crazed, about some terrible gathering force that would blow everything away. Before we returned to England in spring 1991, Gorbachev appointed to the Politburo the sinister men who would oust him in a coup that August. He made a paranoid speech about &quot;enemies&quot;. People were anxious, and we wrote out visa &quot;invitations&quot; to the UK for Soviet friends and friends-of-friends. In the event, Leningrad, whose citizens had voted in June to give their city back its original name, resisted the coup, under the leadership of their liberal mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, and his canny deputy, Vladimir Putin. One of Irina Borisovna&apos;s friends gave me a fur coat to send from the west to a woman in Israel. She had saved his life in a labour camp, smuggling him leftovers from the camp kitchen. He had dreamed of giving her a fur coat to thank her, he said, but when he could finally afford it, he learned that she had suddenly emigrated. &quot;It&apos;s just rabbit fur,&quot; Irina Borisovna said after he&apos;d left. &quot;What will she want with it in Tel Aviv?&quot; Several months after I had posted it, the coat had come back from Israel, the box marked &quot;addressee unknown&quot;. I called Irina Borisovna. Her friend had suffered a stroke, and the coat would be stolen at Russian customs if I sent it back. London charity shops would not take the coat because it was fur, so I pushed it into a clothing drop on a high street. I did not think I would ever live in Russia again. I waited 15 years for my coffee in the Angleterre. It was good. From the hotel breakfast room, I could see the corner of Pochtamtskaya Street. Every house had been made new.

We are not heroes. We are all victims,&quot; murmurs Lilly Ram\u00edrez, the uncompromising partner of Mario G\u00f3mez. At 63, he was the oldest of &quot;the 33&quot; Chilean miners who were trapped half a mile under the Chilean desert on 5 August 2010, and whose rescue became a global event for a TV audience of an estimated 1 billion people. Ever since they emerged 69 days later on the night of 12/13\u00a0October, I have been working on two BBC documentaries: about what happened while the men were down the mine \u2013 and what has happened to them and their families since. Now, as the first anniversary approaches, it is the tenacity and the suffering of the women \u2013 the wives and partners \u2013 that emerges. They and their men were certainly victims but I am not sure Lilly is right: there are certainly heroines \u2013 from Lilly herself to the many other women who have struggled ever since to keep their families together. For their men emerged famous, but changed. For Lilly, the beginning of the story that August night comes straight from the nightmares of miners&apos; families the world over. She was preparing dinner as usual for Mario, one of their four daughters, Romina, and their one-year-old granddaughter Camila when there was the proverbial &quot;knock on the door&quot;. A manager from the mine was standing there. Lilly remembers the man saying there had been an accident at the pit but that they were bringing in the required machinery and the men should be free by morning. &quot;I told him that he could not fool me. I told him that I knew the terrible state of that mine and that if there had been a collapse there was no way the men would be out by morning.&quot; She dropped everything and forced the manager to drive her for an hour to the pithead \u2013 little more than a big hole in the rocky hillside and a couple of cabins. She was to stay there in the middle of the Atacama desert, among the driest places on earth, for the next 69 days, only returning home when Mario had been rescued. By then he had been through a traumatic near-death experience but had also become among the most famous people on the planet. Today, Lilly and Mario are still struggling to understand what happened to him and to them. The San Jos\u00e9 mine produced the usual mix of copper, gold and other minerals that makes the rock under the desert in northern Chile among the most valuable in the world. Both Lilly and Mario knew it was more dangerous than most \u2013 more than 100 years old, the mine comprised huge tunnels that had been driven down over half a mile into the mountainside. Eight miners had died there since 2000 and it had been closed briefly after an accident in 2007. The owners, the San Esteban mining company, paid a premium of 20% for people to work there. Mario was earning just that little bit more before retiring, but he never imagined the possibility of a collapse like this. &quot;I knew the mine had its problems, but I never imagined that the main tunnel would collapse,&quot; he says. When Lilly arrived at the mine that first evening, she found the first rescue teams emerging, having found no way through to the trapped men. &quot;It was chaos. No one knew what was going on.&quot; The mine administrators on the surface were not even sure quite how many people had been trapped. Lilly knew from Mario&apos;s stories of the day-to-day inefficiencies of the mine that it was badly run: &quot;I trusted no one.&quot; As soon as she arrived, she sensed that rescue teams might pull out, insisting that no more could be done. She felt that if the managers were constantly cutting corners on safety, they would hardly commit easily to the possible costs of a full-scale rescue and all that might involve. Apocryphal stories of how miners are simply left to die after an accident are commonplace across Latin America. So Lilly and the other relatives who had made it to the mine &quot;picked up sticks and bars&quot;, confronted the police and blocked the road. &quot;We knew that if they [the rescuers] left, then it would all be over. So we begged the rescue teams not to abandon us, but to help us put pressure on the managers who were there.&quot; The regional police chief, who was at the mine that first night, confirms this was the critical moment. Without the families&apos; intervention he believes the miners might well have been left entombed after the failure of the first attempt to find a way through the main tunnel. In all the backslapping triumph of the final rescue, the story of those first uncertain days tends to be forgotten. Few remember how Lilly and the other women managed to transform a local tragedy into a national event and so save their men. There was little good news in those first days. The next day rescue teams emerged saying a boulder the size of the Empire State Building had collapsed inside the mountain, taking down eight levels of the mine. And the mountain was still moving. They also said there was no way down the main tunnel and that the specially designed escape shafts, supposed to work in such an eventuality, were either blocked or had\u00a0collapsed. Lilly was having none of such defeatism. She remembers: &quot;The authorities up there tried to kick us out. They told us that the children would get sick, that they should be at school\u2026 That we had no business up at the mine\u2026 That we were getting in the way.&quot; By now, most of the G\u00f3mez family had turned up \u2013 as had many of the other relatives, camped out beside the mine, setting up what would later be known all over the world as Camp Hope. Lilly&apos;s voice turns scornful at the patronising tone taken towards them by the very male world of mining. It is an environment where men know best, and women aren&apos;t allowed to enter a mine for fear of bringing bad luck. Looking at the images of those first days, it is astonishing to see these desperate women exploit the power of the media, first on local TV. &quot;We called on the president of Chile not to allow our men to be abandoned,&quot; remembers Lilly. &quot;We appealed to him as a father, as a family man, saying how he should put himself in our shoes.&quot; The women&apos;s raw emotion found an audience. They were lucky. The government had been heavily criticised for its handling of an earthquake and tsunami six months previously. The new business-driven president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, was also perceived as aloof and indifferent to the common worker. Faced with these appeals, the mining minister, Laurence Golborne, was dispatched to the scene. Recalls Elvira &quot;Katty&quot; Valdivia, wife of one of the trapped men, Mario Sep\u00falveda: &quot;We realised more and more journalists were turning up\u2026 so if we were unhappy we almost ate the minister and went out and held a press conference. The press realised we were doing their work for them \u2013 holding the government to task.&quot; Certainly Golborne was responsible for the government taking over the rescue and saying that no expense would be spared in trying to find the trapped men. His transformation from villain \u2013 the minister responsible for the regulatory system that allowed the mine to function and that employed just three inspectors for 884 mines in the region \u2013 into smiling, smooth, English-speaking global TV star over the following 69 days was one of the minor miracles of the whole story. The first 17 days were the worst for the families: the days and nights when no one knew if any of the miners were even alive. As one of those trapped underground says: &quot;At least we knew we were alive but might die. For our families there was the torment of not knowing.&quot; Elvira talks of never sleeping and not knowing what to tell her children. She was never certain that she was not simply waiting to pick up the body of her husband. For Lilly, the period remains a blur. &quot;I barely slept or ate. It was like I was punishing myself. It is wrong if I eat and he&apos;s not eating.&quot; Days of optimism were followed by failure when probes broke or were driven off course by the rock. Lilly says she never doubted Mario was alive. She sensed him next to her. &quot;I know that sounds mad but I felt him with me as I lay down. I felt his breath.&quot; She was sure that at least some of them were alive somewhere beneath the desert floor. But would the rescuers get to them in time? Every day counted \u2013 and so every day the families, on a roller-coaster of hope and despair, kept the pressure on the rescuers via the national Chilean media for whom this had become a daily story. It is easy to forget that it only became a major international story after the miners had been discovered. Researching our film 17 Days Buried Alive, it has become clear quite how inaccurate the company&apos;s maps were and how the drilling was a little &quot;like looking for a needle in a haystack&quot;, a small bunker half a mile down through sheer rock. When, on day 14, the major probe found nothing, Lilly remembers a sense of panic. The authorities had prevented any attempts to explore for ways down via the main tunnel after further collapses on day three, but now the families had found freelance miners (so-called &quot;pirquineros&quot;) who were willing to try to find a way through. The government stood firm, not wanting further accidents; the families, led by Lilly, appealed to the media, clearly losing trust in the experts. Fortunately they never had to force the issue. The miracle, when it came on day\u00a017, when the rescuers heard the probe being hit and so knew someone was alive, was that all 33 were alive and uninjured. You cannot find Lilly on camera during the scenes of jubilation that followed their discovery. As the beaming president read out the note that was attached by the miners to the drillhead (&quot;We are fine in the refuge \u2013 the 33&quot;), Lilly is nowhere to be seen. &quot;I remember I stood up to scream out of euphoria\u2026 and I fainted. I was out for eight minutes\u2026 Then I didn&apos;t go out to celebrate, I went to the statue of the Virgin, I started to cry, telling her I knew she would not fail me.&quot; That was the moment a national news story was turned into a global celebration as the international media descended on the mine. As the rescuers fashioned an escape hole and a capsule to bring the miners out, the appetite for rolling news became overwhelming. Everything was public. Mario G\u00f3mez proposed a church marriage to Lilly. Then there was Yonni Barrios, who had both mistress and wife turning up to claim their piece of his &quot;fame&quot;. (Yonni has ended up with the mistress.) There was also the showman, Edison Pe\u00f1a, who did Elvis Presley impersonations and went running through the underground tunnels, and whose fame was ensured when the photos were published all over the world. On the surface the pithead was turning into a small town of Winnebagos, satellite dishes and TV presenters. In the absence of any real story as the drills did their noisy business, the families became the stars. Their every move in Camp Hope was followed by hordes of cameras looking for an &quot;exclusive&quot; bit of emotion for the next report home to Tokyo, Moscow or London. Elizabeth Segovia was due to give birth to her third child when the disaster struck. She remembers how when the media discovered this, all privacy was washed away. Sitting in her little one-room living space, her face creases with distaste: &quot;They even walked into the house without asking.&quot; Then there was footage of her husband Ariel Ticona, still down the mine, telling her that his new friends, the other trapped miners, had decided that the baby would be called Esperanza, or &quot;Hope&quot;. Elizabeth suddenly found herself carrying a symbol. So with her husband still underground in September, she was filmed on the gurney on the way to deliver and asked: &quot;How do you feel?&quot; The same question was repeated when she was brought out clutching her publicly named baby, Esperanza. Their lives were no longer their own. Days later their men emerged to a watching planet. The Chilean president was there with his wife, smiling broadly. Clearly, the \u00a312m price tag for the rescue was money well spent \u2013 almost a public relations coup for the skill and ingenuity of the Chilean mining industry. A disaster had been turned into a good news story and a triumph. And the world did not simply move on. Invitations from all over came flooding in to the men, most of whom did not have a passport. Then there was talk of possible Hollywood deals. Was it Leonardo or Brad, Angelina or Pen\u00e9lope who would play Ariel and Elizabeth in the movie? Now, a year on, talk of movie millions has receded. Lilly lives on a building site. Like many of the miners, Mario is using what money has come their way to extend their house by a room or two. When you turn up at their home among the one-storey breeze-block houses that make up most of the mining town of Copiap\u00f3 it is a salutary reminder of quite how modest their lives were and are: most live with families of five or more in two-bedroom houses. For some the money has meant running water on tap for the first time. Somewhat surreally, Lilly is perched in her kitchen next to a shiny red Kawasaki motorbike \u2013 the fulfilment of a promise by the manufacturers to all the miners. There are virtually no miles on the clock; 63-year-old Mario had never been on a motorbike before. He has apparently used it twice\u00a0but never been out of second gear. On a shelf is the icon of the Virgin Mary that Lilly had with her at Camp Hope, along with all sorts of &quot;33&quot; memorabilia. Lilly reflects on the past year with mixed feelings. She is of course deeply grateful that Mario and his fellow miners were extracted via the extraordinary rocket-like cage the experts designed. She is also touchingly conscious of the pain suffered by the widows of the New Zealand mining disaster, in November last year. Somehow the miracle at San Jos\u00e9 made the tragedy at Pike River seem all the more painful. At the same time, in her worst moments she wonders whether all her sacrifice last summer was worth it. Life with Mario is not easy. Few of the men have returned unmarked to their former lives. It has been a hugely upsetting process. Understandably, the men have been the centre of attention. They were lauded and flown around the world. They were filmed in Los Angeles as the &quot;CNN Heroes&quot; or introduced as celebrities to 75,000 spectators at Old Trafford at the invitation of Bobby Charlton and a Chilean wine company. When recognised on the streets of New York or Tel Aviv, everyone wants smiles and photos, a touch &quot;for luck&quot; \u2013 a bit of them. When a group (who shall remain nameless) wanted to go to a lap dancing club in Manchester, the bouncers shook their hands and waved them in for free. The story of their rescue is like a ray of light in a dark and difficult world. Back home, the men have received weekly therapy as part of a government insurance scheme that covers their incomes until they are able to go back to work. But their global travels have meant patchy attendance \u2013 and pretty quickly, the authorities were threatening to withdraw the therapy if they continued to go abroad and miss sessions. Meeting the miners, you sense that there has been no coherent strategy to help them find their way back to any sort of normality, no serious attempt to help them through their extraordinary experience. Ariel says he does not need any therapy; others complain that the meetings are pointless and lead nowhere. You sense they have not been told in any coherent way the long-term nature of the trauma they may have suffered and the type of treatment that may require. They were, after all, trapped underground for longer than any other recorded group of men. Certainly in many cases the therapy has combined with much shorter-term solutions: astonishing levels of medication \u2013 pills to let them sleep, pills to keep them calm when awake. Some of the men find solace with one another. The bonds of friendship and solidarity they forged down the mine are now stronger than those with their own families. Others refuse to see one another at all \u2013 jealousy over who is appearing where, appearance money and fame have driven them apart. That is the men. Their wives and partners have to live with them, desperately trying to work out how to cope with quiet lives blown apart. For them, of course, there has been no help on offer. Occasionally the invitations include the families: they all went to Disneyland. Elizabeth with baby Esperanza has been approached. She and Ariel took the baby to Germany for a brief but paid studio appearance: &quot;Five minutes. Show the baby\u2026 No interesting questions.&quot; Elizabeth smiles, puzzled at all the effort to get them thousands of miles to Europe for so little return. Now she has sworn there will be no more trips. A quiet, modest and thoughtful woman, Elizabeth still checks with her kids if there are any photographers hanging around outside their house. You can tell she hates it all. Returning to normal life has been made more difficult because, once the hero status wore off, local jealousy set in. Neighbours see the cameras and journalists coming back again and again. The trauma of what really happened last year to both Ariel and his wife are now distant memories \u2013 and those living nearby only see the glamour and the supposed rewards. It is as if the neighbours wish they too had been &quot;lucky enough&quot; to be trapped down the mine. Elizabeth is clear: &quot;They ask in order to know how you feel; but what we want is to forget all of this. At least for me, I&apos;d rather forget everything. I want no more. I just want my husband back\u2026 I want the life we had before.&quot; She describes how Ariel does not sleep properly. At New Year he simply disappeared to the south of the country at the last moment, leaving Elizabeth at home with their two young boys and a baby girl. There were no explanations. He returned a few days later, uncertain about why he had gone. Elizabeth smiles sadly and shakes her head when asked if she and Ariel have discussed what happened to him down the mine. &quot;I don&apos;t want to disturb him more.&quot; They have a joint faith that holds them together and in February he fulfilled a promise he had made down the mine and they presented the baby to the Virgin Mary, patron saint of miners, during the annual week of celebrations in Copiap\u00f3. A couple of the miners have grabbed their 15 minutes of fame and run with it. The Elvis Presley impersonator, Edison Pe\u00f1a, 34, has followed through on the showman image he built up down the mine. Though no more than an irregular jogger before the accident, the images of him &quot;running the tunnels&quot; have resulted in invitations and appearance fees to compete in both the New York and Tokyo marathons since coming out. He moved to the capital, Santiago, and has made appearances wherever possible. His lifelong passion for Elvis Presley resulted in what he called &quot;his trip of a lifetime&quot; to Graceland and performances of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; on Italian and German TV. Though uncertain of the exact words, his sheer bravura and showmanship make him a star turn. His partner, Ang\u00e9lica, and her four-year-old child have had their life in Copiap\u00f3 uprooted to try to keep up with him. She struggles to understand quite who she is now living with. She says: &quot;The mine has given me another Edison. His nature and his principles were all left down there.&quot; She attempts to manage his dates and to focus his activities \u2013 trying to turn the singing into a possible career in motivational speaking. They performed successfully together to business people at a packed conference in the O2 centre in London earlier in the year. Both are aware there is a small window of time to establish themselves \u2013 but the cost has been high. It is a constant struggle as Edison veers between a rational understanding of what is going on and the darkness he clearly experienced down the mine. There is an underlying anger in him that occasionally explodes in shouting matches and drunken binges. He has frittered much of the money away partying with his brother. Even his mother wonders whether her son should not be hospitalised. Ang\u00e9lica is bitter: &quot;If both God and the devil were down that mine, I think that probably the devil took him.&quot; This spring Ang\u00e9lica persuaded him to go into detox. She \u2013 as with the other women I have met \u2013 has not once had any offer of support or help from the authorities. No one thought that they might be victims, too. Last autumn, the world enjoyed a good news story and moved on, vaguely expecting that these new celebrities were now made for life \u2013 the least they could expect for the experience they went through. Edison the runner has earned and spent a good deal of money. Mario Sep\u00falveda and a couple of others are forging a living as motivational speakers for international corporations. But the majority are now back home, the government&apos;s income guarantees beginning to run out, and facing life again. It is shocking to think that Ariel Ticona has gone back to the mines to earn a living \u2013 to the resigned horror of Elizabeth and their children. Many others are faced with the same reality. What next? How to survive? There is no huge fund set up to keep them in clover for the rest of their lives. Those who thought that international fame meant millions have been proved very wrong. Of course, lawyers for the miners are taking both the owners of the mine and the government to court. Lilly Ram\u00edrez is resolutely clear that lessons must be learned. While she thanks God that Mario emerged alive, this is not a story about miracles. &quot;This was bad management,&quot; she says. &quot;If only the owners thought about the men who worked for them and not just earning a few more pennies, leaving people working in terrible conditions\u2026&quot; But as with corporate negligence cases the world over, judgments will be a matter of years, if they are lucky. Meanwhile the families are left to cope with that underlying trauma. Down at the bottom of the mine for those 69 days last year these men faced themselves and their humanity in ways that we can barely imagine. Many promised themselves, and often God, that they would be totally different people if only they could emerge alive. They promised they would be better husbands and fathers, better people. No doubt they meant it. Stuck in the belly of the earth, they thought they understood the world and their lives in a different light. Reality has proved so much more complex. And for the wives and partners who waited for them the past months have proved equally painful. From 2,000 feet down, Mario promised Lilly that they would get married. Two wedding dates have come and gone. The promise remains unfulfilled.

In an echo of the tactics of pro-democracy protesters in the region, students and young workers in Israel&apos;s main city have pledged to remain in the protest tents until action has been taken to address the issue of high housing costs. Hundreds of supporters joined the core of tent-dwellers in Rothschild Avenue, one of the city&apos;s most prosperous streets, over the weekend. The National Students&apos; Union, which joined the protest after it began, said it would pitch further protest camps in universities and colleges around the country. Protesters told the Israeli media that rents were too high and that the cost of buying homes was prohibitive. &quot;I work as a waitress and study, I receive regular help from my parents, and I&apos;m still overdrawn at the bank,&quot; 26-year-old student Lior Birger told Yedioth Ahranoth. Her rent was 2,300 shekels (\u00a3416) a month.

We have a very large demand for apartments, both for purchase and for rental, and there are not enough apartments.&quot; He said the government would tackle the &quot;insane bureaucracies&quot; that were to blame for the dearth of new construction. Demand for housing is high in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other main cities where most employment is concentrated. The shortage of property is exacerbated by a large number of homes owned by American and European Jews who visit Israel two or three times a year. In some areas, the burgeoning ultra-orthodox community has added to the pressure on housing stock. Ultra-orthodox families are large; having eight or nine children is not uncommon. The Israeli authorities say there is plenty of available housing outside the main cities, and financial incentives are offered to those willing to relocate. Housing minister Ariel Attias told Ma&apos;ariv newspaper: &quot;These people sitting in tents here in Tel Aviv don&apos;t want to live in the periphery. The fact of the matter is that there is only a shortage in areas of high demand. Another fact is that there are plenty of apartments available at much lower prices [outside Tel Aviv].

The centre of the nationwide protest is Rothschild Boulevard, a coveted and affluent avenue in Tel Aviv, whose central pedestrian pathway is now littered with hundreds of small pop-up tents, posters, battered furniture and people strumming guitars and debating into the night. The protest movement has spread to cities and towns across the country, including Jerusalem and the desert city of Beer Sheva. The citizens of the tent villages, along with their many supporters, are expected to join a big rally on Saturday night that, according to Daphni Leif, who initiated the protest on Facebook, will &quot;make the upper echelon shake&quot;. Sitting on a discarded car seat under a makeshift awning close to the walls of Jerusalem&apos;s Old City, Nadav, 28, said rents had increased by around 50% in the past few years. &quot;We are earning less and paying more, and we want a solution that allows us to live in a reasonable place at an affordable price,&quot; he said. A student at Hebrew University with a part-time job, Nadav said one of the reasons for Jerusalem&apos;s high prices was 12,000 &quot;ghost apartments&quot; owned by wealthy Jews who visit for &quot;a month or a month and half, tops, each year. Every apartment they buy pushes up prices for everyone.&quot; Taly Spiegel, 27, said she and her boyfriend had been looking for an apartment to rent for two months but could not find anything they could afford. A third of her income from her job in an environmental consultancy would have to go on rent. Any solution to the housing crisis would take five or 10 years to have an impact, she said. When would she be able to buy an apartment? &quot;Not in the next 10 years,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s very optimistic,&quot; said Nadav. The Facebook-driven tent villages across Israel have echoes of the pro-democracy movements across the Middle East, but Nadav was quick to point out important differences. &quot;This is a middle-class protest, focused on one issue. People in Egypt didn&apos;t have a lot to lose. They had no civil rights and no trust in their government.&quot; But, he added, &quot;I&apos;ve kind of lost my trust in my government too because it doesn&apos;t serve my needs.&quot; The Israeli government is alarmed at the spread of the protests and how the issue has united left and right, religious and secular, and the middle-class with their less-affluent fellow citizens. The housing protest swiftly followed a widespread consumer boycott of cottage cheese in protest at the high cost of dairy products. Dairy companies were forced to cut prices, and the government initiated a review of the industry. The prime minister has this week promised swift action to relieve the housing crisis and has held late-night meetings with cabinet colleagues to consider possible measures. The housing ministry promised to issue tenders for the construction of 6,000 new housing units \u2013 but none in Tel Aviv, and many in West Bank settlements. The Israeli media has devoted large amounts of space and airtime to both the housing and cottage cheese protests, along with a long-running labour dispute by doctors over pay. Domestic issues such as these are more likely to sink Netanyahu&apos;s coalition than progress, or lack of it, in resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, say some commentators. At the Jerusalem tent village, a hand-written poster advertised music sessions, discussion groups and demonstrations. On Friday protesters carried sofas and chairs to one of the city&apos;s main streets for a traffic-blocking sit-in. A group of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who face huge housing pressures due to the large size of their families, pitched a tent alongside the core of students and young workers. How long did they plan to stay? Nadav paused before answering. &quot;As long as it takes,&quot; he said eventually.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-22T14:54:19Z", "title": "Israelis set up tent cities in protest at housing costs", "sentences": ["The centre of the nationwide protest is Rothschild Boulevard, a coveted and affluent avenue in Tel Aviv, whose central pedestrian pathway is now littered with hundreds of small pop-up tents, posters, battered furniture and people strumming guitars and debating into the night.", "The housing ministry promised to issue tenders for the construction of 6,000 new housing units \u2013 but none in Tel Aviv, and many in West Bank settlements."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/22/israel-housing-protests-tent-cities"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Protest", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israel&apos;s legion of tent protesters swiftly rejected an emergency package unveiled by the government on Tuesday that was intended to tackle the housing crisis behind the nationwide civil action. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu was forced to take command of the government&apos;s response in the face of mounting support for the protests, which have seen tent villages springing up in towns and cities across Israel in the past two weeks and, in recent days, the blocking of roads and junctions. According to a poll, the protests over high rents and house prices have the support of 87% of the population. Netanyahu said his plan would help young couples, students and discharged soldiers to find accommodation. It included a discount on the price of land to construction companies building affordable homes for purchase, the building of flats for long-term rental at reduced cost, 10,000 new dormitories for students and a 50% subsidy on public transport for students to encourage them to live in cheaper areas outside city centres. Protesters in the main tent village along Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv dismissed the proposal. Daphni Leif, who initiated the protest on Facebook, said the plan would benefit building contractors rather than those in need of cheap housing. &quot;This is what Netanyahu presented as low-income housing covered by the state. &quot;It will actually be the largest privatisation to be carried out in the history of his rotten premiership.&quot; She went on: &quot;Our answer to his offer is &apos;No&apos;. We here in Tel Aviv may be young, but we weren&apos;t born yesterday.&quot; The leader of the National Union of Israeli Students, Itzik Shmuli, said the government&apos;s offer was generous to students but the struggle over housing needs for other groups should continue. &quot;We can&apos;t ignore the fact that the package that the prime minister offered today to the students of Israel is an unprecedented achievement, I could even say historic, but I look to my left and right all the time and I see that I&apos;m not alone in this struggle,&quot; he said. &quot;When I&apos;m arrested or I struggle in the streets, I see on both sides of me people who aren&apos;t students. &quot;Not only that, I look behind us and see people who don&apos;t have the strength to come and shout with us. Abandoning the greater struggle over housing would be irresponsible and immoral.&quot; The Coalition for Affordable Housing, an umbrella group of rights groups, welcomed the government&apos;s response but warned that it did not go far enough. &quot;It appears the demonstrations have helped sparked a change in perception. Nonetheless, the government has yet to espouse the central message: this is not a struggle of one sector or another but a broad social one,&quot; said lawyer Gil Gan-Mor. &quot;Affordable housing is a universal right and it is the state&apos;s responsibility to ensure every person can realise this right.&quot; Politicians have been alarmed at the popular support for the protest, fearing it could signal broader unrest at the government&apos;s domestic policies. Doctors are involved in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions, and a consumer boycott of cottage cheese in protest over dairy prices won widespread support. A poll published for Haaretz newspaper found that 54% of respondents were dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu had handled the housing issue. Some protesters and rights groups have drawn attention to the government&apos;s generous subsidies of housing in West Bank settlements that they say would be better spent on housing in Israel.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T17:51:40Z", "title": "Israeli protesters reject government's emergency housing package", "sentences": ["Protesters in the main tent village along Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv dismissed the proposal.", "We here in Tel Aviv may be young, but we weren&apos;t born yesterday.&quot; The leader of the National Union of Israeli Students, Itzik Shmuli, said the government&apos;s offer was generous to students but the struggle over housing needs for other groups should continue."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/26/israel-tent-protesters-emergency-housing-package"}, {"tags": ["Israel"], "article": "Israel&apos;s tent city protests over housing are growing by the day, and the mood of civil activism is spreading to other issues. The voices saying this is a serious crisis for Binyamin Netanyahu and his government are getting louder. I visited a protesters in Jerusalem a week ago, and two days later I was in Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, where the protests began and which is the biggest of the tent cities which have now spread to at least 25 towns. It was an impressive sight \u2013 literally hundreds of pop-up tents stretching the length of the city&apos;s most affluent street, populated by mostly young people. There are debating areas, kitchens for creating huge communal meals, musical performances, poetry readings, TV screens \u2013 and genuine anger over the price of housing. Last night, the popular revolt against the cost of living focussed on a new issue: the price of bringing up a child in Israel. Thousands of parents marched with young children in pushchairs, demanding lower prices and tax breaks on baby equipments and childcare. Less than a week ago, tens of thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv in support of the housing protest. Dozens of key roads and junctions have been blocked by protesters, and the entrance to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) has been blockaded. The Histradut, Israel&apos;s trade union federation, has threatened to join the action next week. It will &quot;use all the measures at its disposal,&quot; said leader Ofer Eini. Doctors are on strike over pay and conditions. A Facebook campaign has called on Israeli citizens to &quot;boycott&quot; their jobs on Monday in an unofficial, social media-organised general strike. Demonstrations have been called in six Israeli cities for this Saturday evening \u2013 Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Ashdod, Beer Sheva and Nazareth. The last is an Israeli-Arab town; tent protest villages have appeared in Arab areas of the country in the past few days. Although the main focus is on the cost of housing \u2013 Tel Aviv rents are generally reckoned to absorb about 50% of income \u2013 there is also anger about the price of food, electricity and fuel as well as baby goods. A consumer boycott of cottage cheese in protest at dairy prices won widespread support.      An Israeli man plays on a flute amid tents in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA    Inevitably connections have been made between the Arab Spring and this Israeli Summer. There are of course important differences: the protesters are mostly middle-class; the focus is on the cost of living rather than fundamental rights of freedom and democracy. And the protests are tolerated rather than repressed by the authorities. But there is a palpable hostility in Israel towards the government for its failures to feel the pain of its citizens and to do anything about it. And a poll showed 87% support for the protest. The government has been seriously rattled. Netanyahu&apos;s emergency housing measures, announced this week, were immediately rebuffed by protesters. Even student leaders, who acknowledged that the concessions offered to them were unprecedented, said they would not give up their protest until the needs of other sectors of society had also been addressed.  The protests have been given enormous \u2013 and sympathetic - media coverage here, adding to Netanyahu&apos;s anxieties. An analysis which leads the front page of today&apos;s Haaretz (English edition) begins:  A wartime mood prevailed in the prime minister&apos;s office yesterday. The other shoe dropped. This is a serious, unprecedented, powerful phenomenon. The middle-class rebellion, spreading like wildfire throughout the country, is undoubtedly the most acute crisis the second Netanyahu government has had to deal with.  An editorial in the same (liberal) paper on Thursday said:  Even those who don&apos;t entirely agree with the messages coming out of the protests, marches, hunger strikes and demonstrations blocking traffic can&apos;t ignore the protest&apos;s vigour, in contrast to the apathy and even impassiveness that characeterised the Israeli people in recent years. In the surprising reversal of a process in which sectors of society turned inward, splintering the country and weakening it, the protest has swept up a broad public that has displayed a kind of solidarity and involvement that seemed gone forever.  In Yedioth Ahranoth, Israel&apos;s biggest-selling daily, the respected veteran commentator Nahum Barnea wrote:  The Rothschild Boulevard rebellion is a fascinating phenomenon. It is difficult for me to assess its seriousness, its depth, its life expectancy. It is measured by standards with which I am not familiar, and is part of a different discourse, a different culture, different from the one that characterized previous waves of protest. We are accustomed to gauging waves of protest according to the demands they raise and according to the achievements they win at their end. The residents of the encampment on Rothschild do not have an orderly list of demands and predetermined exit points. They have nothing, save the authentic feeling that their situation, as young middle class Israelis, is terrible, unfair, crying out for change. Just as they loathe Netanyahu or Steinitz, they loathe the residents of the luxury towers further down the street. This is a non-political, anti-political loathing. The question is still open whether at a certain point it will become a political lever that will turn things around in the state.  And in Ma&apos;ariv, Ben Caspit made a connection between the protests and Netanyahu&apos;s other big headache, the looming Palestinian bid for statehood at the UN in September:  For months he has been preparing for September, been afraid of September, been repressing September and been preparing himself for the worst of all in September. But suddenly, Binyamin Netanyahu has now found himself waiting eagerly for September... If only it were September already, the prime minister says to himself, how wonderful it will be in September with the Palestinians and the Arabs and the UN General Assembly and with the entire world against us, and finally we&apos;ll be able to mark for ourselves a common enemy. How wonderful, because better to have the entire world against us than to have the middle class against me.  In September he won&apos;t have to embrace everyone all the time and utter artificial words of reconciliation; he won&apos;t have to grit his teeth and praise the protest movement; he won&apos;t have to recognize publicly the justice of the position of the people demonstrating against him; he won&apos;t have to hold press conferences and shoot programs from the hip and invent new supertankers. In September everything will be clear. Them and us, Arabs and Jews, the stuff that I already know and can handle excellently. I can hardly wait for September.  Indeed, some have said the protesters themselves need to make a few connections, such as whether the funds that successive Israeli governments have poured into subsidising housing in the West Bank settlements could have been better spent on addressing their concerns. Whether the momentum of these protests continue to grow, and develop into something that can seriously threaten the current government, or whether it will dissipate in the torpor of August, is hard to tell at the moment. But right now this seems, on a smaller scale, to be yet another example of this year&apos;s ripples of revolt across the region.\u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 12 hours after publication but may close overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-07-29T07:29:36Z", "title": "Government alarm at citizens' revolt as tent protests spread", "sentences": ["I visited a protesters in Jerusalem a week ago, and two days later I was in Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, where the protests began and which is the biggest of the tent cities which have now spread to at least 25 towns.", "Less than a week ago, tens of thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv in support of the housing protest.", "Demonstrations have been called in six Israeli cities for this Saturday evening \u2013 Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Ashdod, Beer Sheva and Nazareth.", "Although the main focus is on the cost of housing \u2013 Tel Aviv rents are generally reckoned to absorb about 50% of income \u2013 there is also anger about the price of food, electricity and fuel as well as baby goods.", "An Israeli man plays on a flute amid tents in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/jul/29/israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "Protest", "World news"], "article": "Up to 150,000 protesters took to the streets in cities across Israel on Saturday night in the biggest demonstrations the country has seen in decades to demand action on rising house prices and rents, low salaries, the high cost of raising children and other social issues.

For a country with a population of around 7 million, the numbers taking part in the demonstrations were huge. The scale of the protests and the widespread support for them among the Israeli public and in the media have seriously rattled Netanyahu. &quot;We are now in the midst of a complicated and challenging reality, both internationally and domestically,&quot; he told minsters at Sunday&apos;s cabinet meeting. He warned against &quot;irresponsible, hasty and populist steps&quot; which could destabilise Israel&apos;s economy, but added: &quot;All of us, myself first and foremost ...

Meanwhile, Haim Shani, director general of the finance ministry resigned, citing differences of opinion with his political bosses. Thousands of medics joined a rally outside the Knesset (parliament) as part of a long-running work-to-rule over pay and conditions. Parents marched through Jerusalem with their children on Sunday evening in protest over the cost of child-care and baby equipment. &quot;One-third of our combined salaries goes on kindergarten fees,&quot; said Yaron, the father of 10-month-old twins.

The Histradut, Israel&apos;s trade union federation, might also join the protests. Another Facebook page called on Israelis to make mass cash withdrawals from ATMs on 8 August in protest at high bank charges.

Some commentators have declared that the scale of the protests spells the end of the present rightwing coalition government. &quot;It was the night that Binyamin Netanyahu was tossed out of the prime minister&apos;s office in disgrace,&quot; wrote Gideon Levy in Haaretz. &quot;As of [Saturday] he is a lame duck ... When tens of thousands of Israelis scream &apos;Bibi go home&apos;, Bibi will indeed go home.

Inside Israel, this uprising is filling the pages of all newspapers and websites. The uprising started in Tel Aviv. Daphni Leef, a 25-year-old video editor, was sick and tired of the high rents she could no longer afford to pay. On Facebook she called upon other youngsters to join her on Tel Aviv Rothschild Boulevard to set up tents and protest. To her surprise, thousands, first in Tel Aviv, then across the country, joined her with a number of related causes: mothers demanding affordable childcare, doctors seeking reasonable pay and human hours. The demonstrations last Saturday brought more than 150,000 people on to the streets demanding social justice \u2013 and another Facebook revolution was started in the Middle East. In the beginning, Likud members of the Knesset dismissed the uprising as a &quot;far-left conspiracy&quot;, but soon the Netanyahu government, generally quite impervious to the public&apos;s mood, became nervous. Binyamin Netanyahu, who tends to keep himself out of social issues, quickly began to make offers to the demonstrators, which, so far, they haven&apos;t accepted. The demonstrators have kept the protests apolitical, and a week ago, support for their demands commanded the support of 87% of the respondents to a Haaretz poll \u2013 an unheard of degree of unity in Israel&apos;s divided citizenry. It may be time to venture an interpretation of this uprising which, many feel, carries great transformative potential. Netanyahu came to power, once again, in March 2009. He chose to build a rightwing coalition, beefed up by the weakened Labour party. His fateful choice was to appoint Avigdor Lieberman, a rightwinger of Moldovan descent who ran on an anti-Arab platform, into the foreign ministry. The ruling coalition of Israel&apos;s 18th Knesset has gone into a maelstrom of anti-democratic legislation spearheaded by Lieberman. Step after step, laws were passed that threatened Israel&apos;s character as a liberal democracy. Netanyahu felt that Lieberman was undermining his standing as the undisputed leader of the right, and the Likud soon began to compete with Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beitenu party in proposing, and at times passing, anti-democratic laws such as the anti-boycott bill. Israel&apos;s liberals were hardly to be heard: protests against the laws were limited to the press, academia and some public intellectuals. The public was silent. The reason for this was that Israeli liberals were largely identified with the left and its attempts to bring peace with the Palestinians. Israel&apos;s electorate has never forgiven the left for its promise that peace was at hand, a promise ripped apart by endless suicide bombings in Israel&apos;s cities during the second Intifada from 2000 to 2003. The citizenry was further angered when, after Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip, this area became the launching pad for years of rocket-shelling of Israel&apos;s south. Peace seemed a hoax; liberals looked hopelessly naive at best. Lieberman and Netanyahu rode this wave of anger and depicted Israeli liberals as anti-Zionist collaborators with Israel&apos;s enemies. And it seemed as if nothing could stop the wave of totalitarian measures they implemented. Israel&apos;s middle class has been politically either complacent or apathetic during the last decade. Because of the failure of the Oslo peace process, it no longer had a way to defend liberal values and to demand accountability from government. This uprising is really that of Israel&apos;s disfranchised secular middle class. Bogged down by exorbitant taxes and carrying the burden of Israel&apos;s economy, they receive very little in turn. Israel&apos;s school system is in the pits with class sizes of about 40; many Israeli women cannot afford going to work because childcare is very expensive; the public transport is that of a third-world country. The current uprising has given Israeli liberals a voice again. Its authenticity could not be disputed: to this day there is no clear leadership. The atmosphere on the boulevard, where hundreds of tents fill the tree-lined spaces, feels like a remake of Woodstock. The demands sound eminently reasonable to all sectors of Israel&apos;s population. But the apolitical character of the protest is being challenged. Netanyahu is already claiming that the protesters are driven by political motivations. His intent is clear: he wants to delegitimise them and claim that their real goal is to topple his government. This, he hopes, will weaken nationwide support for their demands. On Monday, members of the Likud central committee started to say that the demonstrators are just a bunch of sushi eaters with nargilas (Arab pipes) \u2013 ie leftist radicals \u2013 and that the media was exaggerating their numbers. Because the process so far has been rather chaotic, it is very difficult to predict what it will lead to. If the Likud and Yisrael Beitenu step up their attack, the protesters will not have any choice but to confront the current coalition in the political arena as well. They will have to say that taxpayers&apos; money in Israel has been spent lavishly in the occupied territories; that billions of shekels go to child support for the ultra-Orthodox, most of whom do not contribute to the economy; that the silent collusion of Israel&apos;s governments with the settlers is ruining the country morally, politically and economically. In the end, the call for social justice and the demand to reinstate liberal values in Israel cannot be separated. Once these demands are politicised, anything can happen. Netanyahu may be able to delegitimise the protests as an undemocratic attempt to topple his government, and support for the uprising may fizzle. But it could also be that Israel&apos;s secular middle class will feel this is its last chance to assert its rights against the coalition of national-religious, extreme right and ultra-Orthodox parties, and that this is the moment to stop Israel&apos;s move to the right that is pushing the country towards an apartheid regime, moral, economic and political bankruptcy. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-08-02T13:12:02Z", "title": "Israel's secular middle class strikes back | Carlo Strenger", "sentences": ["The uprising started in Tel Aviv.", "On Facebook she called upon other youngsters to join her on Tel Aviv Rothschild Boulevard to set up tents and protest.", "To her surprise, thousands, first in Tel Aviv, then across the country, joined her with a number of related causes: mothers demanding affordable childcare, doctors seeking reasonable pay and human hours."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/02/israel-middle-class-uprising"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Protest", "World news"], "article": "Tent villages are to be pitched in up to a dozen Israeli-Arab towns on Friday as momentum behind Israel&apos;s grassroots campaign for social justice continues to build and unite disparate sections of society.

On Wednesday dairy farmers, army reservists, animal rights activists and West Bank settlers all held separate protests in Tel Aviv&apos;s Rothschild Boulevard, the centre of the nationwide movement. In Jerusalem, protesters blocked roads leading to the Knesset (parliament). Further demonstrations have been called across the country for Saturday following last week&apos;s marches, which attracted around 150,000 people, almost unprecedented in a country with a population of 7 million. Protesters are uniting over the high costs of housing, rearing children, fuel, electricity and food but the dominant slogan has been: &quot;The people demand social justice.&quot; &quot;The protest is still growing,&quot; said Stav Shaffir, 26, one of the leaders. &quot;Every day I get phone calls from new tent cities.&quot; Shaffir, a masters student, was one of the first to pitch a tent three weeks ago in protest at the high rents. At first, she said, &quot;I\u00a0felt a bit guilty about starting a protest over housing. I didn&apos;t feel it was the most important issue for us.&quot; The Knesset had just passed a law prohibiting boycott movements. &quot;People were talking about the end of democracy. That seemed more important than housing.&quot; Plus, she said, &quot;The sense here that we&apos;re living in a war zone, traumatised by terror \u2013 it&apos;s like we&apos;re not allowed to talk about &apos;small&apos; issues, day-to-day stuff.&quot; The first night there were a few hundred protesters, with a smaller number pitching tents. Now, hundreds of tents and shelters \u2013 along with kitchens, toilets, a kindergarten, debating circles, art exhibitions \u2013 stretch along the length of the prosperous avenue. Tent villages have appeared in 40 towns and alongside the major marches last Saturday, there have been countless small demonstrations on multiple issues involving tens of thousands of people. An opinion poll earlier this week said 91% of the Israeli public backed the campaign. The widespread support, according to Shaffir, is the result of consensus-building: &quot;Many of us have made a lot of compromises on our own ideologies to gain consensus. We have put egos aside, and agreed not to talk about more political issues, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or settlements. We have said: &apos;Let&apos;s focus on something that will bring everyone together,&apos; \u2013 and it&apos;s worked.&quot; When a group of rightwing nationalists from West Bank settlements came to Tel Aviv earlier this week to promote settlement expansion as a solution to the housing problem, Shaffir was firm in telling them they were welcome to join the debate but &quot;settlements are not part of the Israeli consensus, and so are not part of the solution that has to work for everyone&quot;. Israelis aggrieved at the cost of living understood the connection between the amount of money the government spent on security and the issues leading them onto the streets, Shaffir said. &quot;People talk about it all the time. But security also means education, health, housing. We don&apos;t want to be controlled by fear. People here think they have no right to do anything [on social issues] in case other people think that&apos;s against your country.&quot; After almost three weeks, the protesters demanded a reduction in indirect taxes and a tax increase for high earners, rent controls, free education from the age of three months, limits on privatisation, and an increase in the minimum wage. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has acknowledged the &quot;wave of populism&quot; sweeping the country but is reluctant to make concessions, and his strategy appears to be to express sympathy while riding out the protests in the hope that attention will switch to the Palestinian bid for statehood at the UN in September. Shaffir said she was happy the protests were bringing together groups traditionally on opposing sides: &quot;Left and right; religious and secular; Arabs and Jews.&quot; A tent village in the mixed area of Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, had &quot;brought tears to my eyes&quot;, she said. &quot;People found themselves, Arabs and Jews, sitting together in tents every evening sharing problems and ideas.&quot; There has been some criticism in the media of the &quot;self-appointed leaders&quot; of the protests, dubbed the &quot;Secret Seven&quot;. Shaffir said: &quot;It&apos;s true, who are we to be leaders? My role here is to stop bigger organisations taking control. Every day I stand with my hands in front of me stopping interests from taking over this beautiful thing. But everyone who wants to be a leader here is a leader.&quot; Back on Rothschild Boulevard, three teenage girls played cards in a tent they had erected only the day before.

Sumud means steadfastness, and it has turned into a strategy: when the imbalance of power is so pronounced, the most important thing to do is to stay put. Staying put against overwhelming odds is regarded as a victory. But it is more than just a word. It&apos;s the look in Rifqua al-Kurd&apos;s eyes as she fights eviction in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem. She lives out of boxes, because when the police throw her out and the settlers move in she doesn&apos;t want the clothes thrown into the street. Sumud is the tenacity with which Mohammed Hussein Jibor, a farmer, clings to a rock-strewn patch of land in the South Hebron hills in 38 degrees heat. His water cistern has been destroyed three times this year because he does not have a permit for it, even though the court acknowleges it is his land. Sumud sums up the attitude of the Bedouin struggling to stay in 45 unrecognised villages in the Negev, without a supply of water, electricity or schools. Once the entire Negev was theirs, now only 6% is. Israel wants to put the Bedouin in townships while establishing 130 Jewish villages and agricultural settlements on the land. Talab al-Sana, their MP, says: &quot;They want Jews to be Bedouin and Bedouin to be Ashkenaz [European Jews].&quot; Sumud crops up in some unexpected places \u2013 not only East Jerusalem, the West Bank or Gaza, but in Jaffa, Lod, and in Arab communities all over Israel among people who have nominally the same rights as any other citizen. As September looms and with it the attempt by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to get a declaration of statehood from the UN, the spotlight has swivelled on to these. This is not a casual shift, as it could affect outcomes. If Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, and allows it to join with Gaza, the result could be two states \u2013 a Palestinian one alongside an Israeli one. But if you accompany that with a civil rights movement inside Israel, the goal could be very different \u2013 a secular, democratic state &quot;for all its citizens&quot;, where Jew, Christian and Muslim are equal. A one-state solution in which Jewish citizens lose an inbuilt majority. The end of Zionism, no less. More than 100,000 Arabs stayed on after 1948 and today number more than 1.5\u00a0million, roughly a fifth of the population of Israel. The &apos;48 Arabs, as they are known, are no longer seen as separate, exclusive or privileged. After so many years, their fight for civil rights within Israel is a struggle most Palestinians under occupation can identify with. It was not always thus. They were known pejoratively as &quot;insiders&quot;, according to the dissident Israeli historian Ilan Papp\u00e9, who has written a book about them. Trying to be &quot;good Arabs&quot; in Jewish eyes was tantamout to collaboration in Arab ones. But much has changed. Papp\u00e9 says: &quot;The people in the West Bank understood what the minorities inside Israel felt like, after years of deriding them for being lesser Palestinians, and that when the main impulse of the power that controls everything in your daily life is expulsionist, staying put is quite an achievement.&quot; Another historian, Sami Abu Shehadeh, is doing his doctoral thesis on Jaffa as the major Arab cultural and economic centre during the mandate period. It had its own Arabic press, eight cinemas, five hospitals and about 120,000 people. After the 1948 war, 3,900 were left. It is standard practice for historians at Tel Aviv University to explain the time frame of their research and why it ends when it does. Shehadeh stopped his in 1948 because that was when Jaffa stopped existing as a city. &quot;My adviser told me: &apos;Sami, we might agree or disagree on the word expelled, but I don&apos;t know who will sit on your committee [to adjudicate the thesis] if you insist on using it.&apos;&quot; A compromise was negotiated \u2013 rare in this part of the world. Shehadeh wrote that, as a result of the war, the Arabs of Jaffa &quot;had to leave and were not allowed back&quot;. &quot;Forget politics, on the basic historical facts we fight on everything,&quot; he says. &quot;I dont even know where to start a normal discussion. We live totally separate lives. Outsiders don&apos;t see it. In Israel there are different spaces for Jews and Arabs. The problem is the vast majority of elites, and not just political but economic and intellectual ones, define themselves as being part of a Jewish democracy and concentrate all their thinking on the rights of the Jews. Non-Jews, be they Christian or Muslim, are excluded from any serious decision-making process in their lives.&quot; That goes for the Israeli left as well as right. As a member of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipal council, Shehadeh tried to persuade Ya\u00ebl Dayan, the leftwing head of the coalition in charge of the council, to divide Tel Aviv-Jaffa into quarters, like any other big city. Maybe it is better for the Arabs of Jaffa if we keep on running things for them, he was told. &quot;The only thing the world knows about Jaffa is oranges,&quot; says Shehadeh. &quot;I am not an orange. [Benjamin] Netanyahu, when he was finance minister, called people like me a demographic timebomb. How can I explain to my children that they are a bomb?&quot; The discrimination suffered by his community is extensively documented. Half live below the poverty line, 48% can not build a house for the next 15 years because there no permits or plans. Only 19% of Arab women with Israeli citizenship are in a job, compared with 65% of Jewish women. But the terrain of their changing identity and allegiance is not so well mapped. Israel demands expressions of loyality from them. Loyality to what, they ask.

Ron Arad&apos;s genius is such a thing.&quot; He is a designer who was educated as an architect and now is doing some architecture again, dabbles in digitalia, and does things that might be called sculpture and/ or installation art. The most constant thing about him is his appearance \u2013 asymmetric hat (woven or felt), T-shirt, big trousers, no socks, amused smile, sidelong look. Also his studio in Chalk Farm, where he has been for 20 years, and which still has the &quot;temporary&quot; construction work he installed when he moved in, and now looks like a period piece. Foer made his remark in an essay of wit, erudition, and quotes from Nietzsche and Oscar Wilde, written because he and Arad became friends, after they hit it off at some function or other &quot;in a city neither of us called home&quot;. One of Arad&apos;s skills is the ability to make friends with creative people and, from 9 August, everyone is invited to a party he has orchestrated in that venue of legend, the Roundhouse. &quot;I thought it would be a lot more exciting to invite other people to do it than do it all myself,&quot; he says. This is Curtain Call, an installation in which a curtain of white silicon rods, eight metres high and hanging from above, encloses the great circular centre of the building. The rods collectively form a 360\u00b0 screen on to which are projected animations and films by some of Arad&apos;s creative friends. Christian Marclay will ring the circle with piano keys, running vertically, played by giant projected hands. Mat Collishaw will show a gorgeous tropical landscape which is nonetheless &quot;poisoned by diseased and malicious-looking flowers&quot;. Ori Gersht will show crowds at a bullfight, putting viewers in the middle of the circle in the position of a matador, or a bull. Because the rods are translucent you will be able to see the projections from inside and outside the circle. The silicon is bendy and, as you will be required to push through it, the curtain will be in a state of perpetual oscillation. The spectators, as they pass in and out, become part of the action. On one night there will be Bring Your Own Beamer, a &quot;favela of images&quot; in which people can bring their own laptops, and have their work projected on to the screens. Arad has promised that &quot;you&apos;ll be engulfed by images \u2013 a captive, but also a creator&quot;. He says the aim is to be &quot;as inclusive as the Roundhouse is, plus high art, but without the bolshevism of\u00a0the art market. Kids will love it.&quot; If Curtain Call is a big sophisticated playground, it is consistent with almost everything Arad has done ever since the day, long ago, when he walked out one lunchtime from the middling architectural practice where he worked, cut seats out of an old Rover car and made from them the prototype of his Rover Chair, which became an instant hit. Since then he has been producing objects characterised by opulent curves and a playful interest in the unexpected properties of materials. He likes rust and reflection, fat things resting on thin things, or off-balance objects that look like they should fall over. He likes things to look highly finished and still in progress at the same time. He likes loopy, curvy bits and bits of text, whether graffiti-like scrawls or digital displays, applied to his work. For a while these objects were mostly furniture, but he started doing interiors and other forms of product design. Ten years ago he presented an idea for a touch-screen tablet to the electronics company LG that was &quot;pretty much the iPad, but they had no idea what we were talking about&quot;. He does sunglasses. Now, more than 30 years after he left architecture school, he is doing large buildings \u2013 his Design Museum Holon, in his native Tel Aviv, was completed last year, his M\u00e9diacit\u00e9 shopping centre in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium in 2009. He is now designing an apartment block and a commercial development of &quot;science fiction scale&quot; in Tel Aviv, and a hotel in east London. He also does &quot;studio pieces&quot;, works he does not quite call sculpture, but which are not quite anything else, and which fetch handsome prices as one-off collectibles. &quot;I&apos;m lucky that, however much I invest in something, someone will like it,&quot; is the way he puts it. For all his dressed-down, scruffy style, he attracts luxury clients. A consortium of Swarovksi, Red Bull and Bernie Ecclestone commissioned him to design a restaurant at a ski station near Gstaad, a rotating thing perched on a peak that is pure Ernst Stavro Blofeld. &quot;I don&apos;t care how much it costs,&quot; said Ecclestone. &quot;I only care who&apos;s paying for it.&quot; Whatever answer he got was not the right one, and the project is not currently going ahead. The common denominator to all this work is playing with stuff to make other stuff. There is no grand theory or social programme, and whether the opportunity takes the form of an ultra-luxury restaurant, or a popular installation at the Roundhouse (admission charge: pay what you can), is not Arad&apos;s main concern. &quot;We&apos;re interested in doing fantastic, amazing projects,&quot; is his not very sophisticated philosophy. He wants to stay in motion, to keep on inventing, not to pause too long on the ground: &quot;We&apos;re the last people to be upset if someone comes back in the future with a better idea to make something we&apos;ve done redundant. It might be us who do it.&quot; He&apos;s at his best when he gets close to the business of making things, of what materials and techniques can and can&apos;t do. He&apos;s less convincing when he floats into a world of whirls and blobs, of making shapes for the sake of it. Curtain Call, with its smart use of hanging silicon, and projection and light, and its engagement with other artists and the public, promises to be one of the good ones.

An estimated 300,000 people took to the streets on Saturday to press their demands for social justice and lower living costs in the largest demonstrations over social issues ever seen in the country. Despite scepticism that turnout could surpass previous events, almost twice as many people joined marches in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other towns and cities. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s prime minister, was forced to respond to the spiralling protests with the establishment of a committee to &quot;listen to the distress&quot; and recommend action. The protests, which began with a handful of tents erected in Tel Aviv, have unleashed a national fury at the government&apos;s failure to respond to the needs and complaints of middle-income Israelis. Tent cities have mushroomed in more than 40 locations across the country as well as daily demonstrations and roadblocks over the cost of housing, childcare, fuel, food and electricity. Despite Israel&apos;s relatively healthy economic growth and low unemployment, wage disparities are big, wealth and corporate power are highly concentrated, food prices have increased almost 13% since 2005 and many people spend 50% of their incomes on rent or mortgages. Up to 250,000 people marched through Tel Aviv to Israel&apos;s military headquarters on Saturday, causing major traffic diversions until the early hours. One sign, in Hebrew and Arabic, read &quot;Egypt is here&quot;. In Jerusalem, up to 30,000 people marched to Netanyahu&apos;s residence, chanting the rallying cry of the past three weeks: &quot;The people demand social justice.&quot; Smaller protests were also held in Kiryat Shmona, Modi&apos;in, Hod HaSharon, Ashkelon, Eilat and Dimona, according to media reports. Stav Shaffir, 26, one of the original tent protesters in Tel Aviv, told the Guardian that &quot;more pressure, more people, more tents and more protests&quot; would follow. &quot;Right now we&apos;re coming together to think about our next steps. There will be more protests \u2013 definitely more protests.&quot; A loose alliance of activists behind the protests called for a million-strong march on 3 September. The committee set up by Netanyahu was ordered to report within a month. &quot;It is impossible to ignore the voices coming from the public,&quot; the prime minister said in a lengthy statement. Israel&apos;s economy was strong, but &quot;we know that we must make the internal corrections ... social corrections, with sensitivity&quot;. He added: &quot;We will listen to everyone. We will speak with everyone.&quot; However, Netanyahu has so far refused to meet a delegation from the tent protesters. &quot;This is definitely not enough,&quot; said Shaffir. &quot;We have been on the street for almost a month, and there has been no contact at all from Netanyahu. The public thinks the government is out of touch with the people, and people are angry and want to see change.&quot;Shimon Peres, Israel&apos;s president, said the protests were a &quot;testament to the nation&apos;s maturity&quot;. In contrast, the extreme right foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that cafes in Tel Aviv were &quot;packed to capacity&quot; adding that there was no reason &quot;to be depressed&quot;. The social protests have become the most pressing issue for the Israeli government, with the potential, according to some commentators, to topple Netanyahu&apos;s coalition. Opinion polls have put public support for the protests at around 90%. Protest leaders have insisted that bringing the government down is not their aim. The organisers have striven to keep the movement as inclusive as possible, incorporating left and right, secular and religious, Jews and Arabs. They have avoided publicly making connections between the amount spent on settlements and the military for fear of being branded anti-occupation activists. &quot;It is certainly one of the largest street protests we have experienced in Israel,&quot; said Tamar Hermann, of the Israel Democracy Institute. &quot;But what really makes it different is its heterogeneous nature. Normally protest is homogeneous. Diversity is as important as size.&quot; She said Israel&apos;s economic health was &quot;one of the reasons people feel able to protest. When you are at rock bottom you invest everything in survival. People here are not devastated but discontented.&quot; Avraham Burg, a former speaker of the Israeli parliament, said the protests would define Israeli society as &quot;a collective based either on social solidarity or national territorialism&quot;. Indications that the former was outgunning the latter were &quot;why all the settlers are so upset&quot;, he added. Some observers believe Netanyahu will try to ride out the protests until September, when the Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations is likely to dominate the political agenda. The Palestinians, they say, are a familiar foe that Netanyahu feels he can outmanoeuvre whereas the Israeli social justice protesters are an unknown force. Analogies drawn between the Arab spring and the Israeli summer were not completely misplaced, according to Hermann. &quot;Israelis generally want to disassociate themselves from the Middle East, culturally, politically and economically. But obviously they have watched Tahrir Square as well as events in Spain and Athens. &quot;Protest is a phenomenon which often spills over national borders. This fits into a new wave of street protests that we are now seeing all over the world, including the Middle East.&quot; Palestinian demands As Israelis take to the streets to demand social justice, Palestinians are also gearing up to protest next month over their demands for recognition of a Palestinian state by the United Nations. President Mahmoud Abbas has urged &quot;popular resistance&quot; as well as diplomatic moves. &quot;In this coming period, we want mass action, organised and co-ordinated in every place,&quot; he said last month. &quot;This is a chance to raise our voices in front of the world and say we want our rights.&quot; Marwan Barghouti, an iconic figure for Palestinians who is serving five life sentences in an Israeli jail, also called for mass action. &quot;I call on our people in the homeland and in the diaspora to go out in a peaceful, million-man march during the week of voting in the United Nations in September,&quot; he said. Palestinian leaders, backed by the Arab League, intend to ask the UN general assembly to back a Palestinian state when it meets in September. However, full recognition requires the backing of the UN security council, which the US has vowed to veto. The Israeli protests are being given scant attention in the Palestinian media. But, said Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian parliament, &quot;we feel sympathetic because they are also demanding social rights. At the same time we hope that they will see that one of the reasons for this crisis is the Israeli occupation policy and military spending. &quot;We hope that this social movement becomes a political movement which demands peace and end to occupation.&quot; Harriet Sherwood", "publicationDate": "2011-08-07T18:09:47Z", "title": "Israelis plan million-strong march as protesters call for social justice", "sentences": ["Despite scepticism that turnout could surpass previous events, almost twice as many people joined marches in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other towns and cities.", "The protests, which began with a handful of tents erected in Tel Aviv, have unleashed a national fury at the government&apos;s failure to respond to the needs and complaints of middle-income Israelis.", "Up to 250,000 people marched through Tel Aviv to Israel&apos;s military headquarters on Saturday, causing major traffic diversions until the early hours.", "Stav Shaffir, 26, one of the original tent protesters in Tel Aviv, told the Guardian that &quot;more pressure, more people, more tents and more protests&quot; would follow.", "In contrast, the extreme right foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that cafes in Tel Aviv were &quot;packed to capacity&quot; adding that there was no reason &quot;to be depressed&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/israelis-march-protesters-social-justice"}, {"tags": ["Technology startups", "Media", "Digital media", "Technology"], "article": "Saul Klein: Photo by Joi on Flickr. Some rights reserved Often copied, Seedcamp remains the original and best UK bootcamp for startups, now stretching across 10 events a year in 10 locations including Paris, Berlin, Tel Aviv, London, New York, Johannesburg, New York and Mumbai. Startups apply, and the best are hand-picked for an intensive bootcamp that involves pitching, revising their business, and picking the brains of some high-calibre mentors from the investment and entrepreneurial sectors. Today&apos;s event at UCL was a one-day Mini Seedcamp with 20 startups from across Europe.\u00a0&quot;The number one thing they want is business advice \u2013 they are hungry for it, and get it in very concentrated form,&quot; said Seedcamp co-founder Saul Klein. &quot;The second is to build their network, and they also want the validation of saying &apos;Seedcamp invested in me&apos; or &apos;so-and-so wrote about me&apos;. Ironically the next thing they want is money. It&apos;s not the first thing, because they know that if they get the first three right, that will come.&quot; It has taken four years for Seedcamp to build a network of 2,000 mentors and a programme that is recognised by and in demand from startups. So is the government&apos;s Tech City strategy really a good use of money if it will either replicate or compete with existing, successful schemes like Seedcamp? &quot;They recognise that startups are important for\u00a0job creation, productivity improvement and growth. But if I were the government I would be investing in education \u2013 that&apos;s the biggest challenge.&quot;\u00a0To grow a company from zero to 50 people is challenging but possible, Klein said. But it&apos;s growing companies beyond that, to hundreds of staff, that is virtually impossible in Europe. &quot;The talent pool just isn&apos;t deep enough,&quot; said Klein. &quot;Kids should be going to university and coming out like Matt Jones, as interface designers, or incredible online marketers like Andrew Hunter, or brilliant product managers like Mike Bartlett at Skype. You need armies of those people to create great businesses.&quot; Our education system, then, just isn&apos;t vocationally focused enough despite the quality of our computer science graduates, and is perhaps too detached from the real experience and demands of running a business. Klein points to psychologist Abraham Maslow&apos;s hierarchy of needs to inform the direction of web businesses in the next 10 to 15 years, moving from fundamental, physical needs, through friendship and esteem to self-actualisation \u2013 though web services are actually moving from superficial, entertainment-focused services to more fundamental tools, like health, banking and travel. Who stands out from this bunch?

Those in power, he said, were devoid of fresh thinking, and this is why &quot;the protests in Greece affect all of you directly&quot;. When the dust has settled on 2011 perhaps the aspect of it that will prove most striking to historians is that in a period where so many old certainties dissolved, from the stability of dictatorships in the Middle East to the sturdiness of the neoliberal economic framework in Europe, America and beyond, those with their hands on the levers of formal power had so few ideas to offer. From Arab autocrats to eurozone finance ministers, paucity of original thought has prevailed at the top and the prescription has always been more of the same: reheated rhetoric and stencil-cut solutions, all worn lifeless with weary familiarity. Little wonder then that from Santiago to Sana&apos;a, something else has arisen to fill the void \u2013 and that those still rooted in the old models of thinking find themselves lacking the linguistic tools necessary to even describe the phenomenon, never mind understand it. A &quot;global temper tantrum&quot; is the most historian and empire cheerleader-in-chief Niall Ferguson could muster in his effort to characterise this year&apos;s developments, which have seen hundreds of thousands in north Africa, led by the young, braving bullets to topple entrenched regimes. Meanwhile in southern Europe, South America, Wisconsin and London, city centres have been occupied and youths have mobilised, challenging existing power structures and fighting \u2013 with messy, uneven consequences \u2013 to articulate an alternative. We are witnessing, says Priyamvada Gopal, an English professor at Cambridge, the &quot;momentary transformation of anger from a dirty word into the very currency of political exchange&quot;. Each of these struggles has been specific to local contexts but they share more than just the imagery of occupied squares, tents and teargas. They are bound together by a common sense of disenfranchisement and the belief that the participants have it in them to create a new reality \u2013 and that at the moment, largely inspired by the Arab spring and the global economic meltdown, a window of opportunity to do so is open. &quot;The repression is brutal \u2026 and the teargas stronger than ever,&quot; says Camila Vallejo, president of the Chilean University student union which has brought 100,000 students on to the streets and taken control of 300 schools in an attempt to rebuild the country&apos;s education system from scratch \u2013 holding mass kissathons and Michael Jackson dance routines in the process. &quot;We have been protesting not about reform, but about wholesale restructuring \u2026 if we don&apos;t have real change now, it&apos;s not going to happen.&quot; The scope of her ambition echoes that found in Syntagma Square, where opposition to an EU/IMF bailout and its accompanying austerity measures has morphed into a broader critique of social injustice. &quot;We are ordinary people, we are like you,&quot; reads the mission statement of the Real Democracy website \u2013 the online hub of the Syntagma protests \u2013 before going on to explore the alienation many Greeks feel from the organs of the state. &quot;Without us none of this would exist, because we move the world \u2026 I am outraged. I think I can change it.&quot; It&apos;s easy to overstate the linkages; those joining the anti-government uprising in the Syrian town of Hama and los indignados of Barcelona and Madrid are striving to confront very different enemies and are facing wildly dissimilar levels of repression as a result. But connections are apparent, not least in the protesters&apos; rejection of the old terms of debate and a commitment to build something else in response on the streets \u2013 a commitment most visible in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square, where protesters congregated not only to face down the regime but also to prove that an alternative was feasible; the chant ahum ahum ahum, al masryeen ahum (&apos;here, here, here, the Egyptians are here) was a snub to Hosni Mubarak, but also a reminder that the contours of society were being reimagined from the ground upwards. Elites have yet to grasp that hunger for meaningful grassroots change and the desire to reclaim agency over a future that appears depressingly predetermined, be it under the crony capitalism and police brutality of Middle Eastern despots or the more sanitised platter of unemployment and austerity being handed down by governments in the west. Those on the other side of the divide have been unable to keep pace with the rapid shift in thinking; in his analysis, Ferguson adopts the kind of paternalistic tone that came easily to Mubarak as the octogenarian gently chided Egypt&apos;s youth for daring to question his authority, or to the unelected rating agency chiefs who condemn whole nations to poverty with a sad shake of the head and a well-intentioned finger-wag against spending profligacy. &quot;Historically in any country and in any context it&apos;s young people who are at the core of protests,&quot; says Gopal. &quot;But at this moment in history we&apos;re seeing a shared sense of deprivation among the young, a shared sense of there being a democracy deficit across the world. In all these places neoliberal economic policies have intensified their hold and affected young people most directly, young people looking for employment, study, prospects. I think it has cut young people to the bone, and they&apos;re confronting it directly.&quot; Two other common motifs run through this year&apos;s rebellions. First has been the collapse in authority of traditional institutions; from Mubarak&apos;s cult of personality to the seemingly incessant scandals engulfing Britain&apos;s arbiters of political, financial and cultural control \u2013 bankers, MPs, and the Murdoch media empire. The crumpling is contagious, fuelling rebellions in the most unlikely of places. &quot;People are on the edge, you can&apos;t fool us anymore,&quot; says Avi Cohen, a 25-year-old drama student who has joined a 2,000-strong tent protest on Tel Aviv&apos;s exclusive Rothschild Avenue. The protesters say they are campaigning for social justice, leaving the question of Palestinian injustice off the table for now in an effort to build the broadest possible consensus. Like many of his counterparts elsewhere, Rotem Tsbueri has lost faith in the official mechanisms of political reform. &quot;We&apos;re not interested in changing ministers or governments, we want to change the way things are done. It&apos;s not about who&apos;s in the government, it&apos;s about the way they work and think.&quot; The 15-M movement in Spain, which organised demonstrations in 58 cities earlier this year under the slogan &quot;they don&apos;t represent us&quot;, embodies a similar yearning for a new political framework to arise. &quot;We don&apos;t want to form a political party because it would destroy the horizontal nature of the movement,&quot; says Carlos Pederes, an IT worker who has been involved in the protests from the beginning. &quot;[Plus] the system is rigged so that only the two big parties can win, so it would be pointless.&quot; The second commonality has been the tools used to mobilise dissent. Although the role of online social media in the Arab uprisings has often been overstated, there can be no doubt that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have enabled diverse groups to quickly garner broad support for acts of resistance \u2013 and that this means of communication has coloured the internal organisation of protest movements. &quot;One of the most unifying aspects between our own organisation and other movements around the world is that we&apos;re relatively non-hierarchical and decentralised,&quot; says Steve Taylor, a\u00a0campaigner with UK Uncut. &quot;Today there may not be a single unifying ideology of change among global youth protests of the sort that united people in 1968, but there is a common ideology embedded within our shared model of organisation \u2013 no egos, no celebrities, no one telling anyone else what to do and no one willing to take orders \u2013 one that lends itself to online social media and has captured people&apos;s imaginations.&quot; The bonds between 2011&apos;s islands of youth dissent remain limited. Although the root causes of anger may be similar, the levels of politicisation among those expressing that anger vary wildly; Gopal says she was struck by the diffuseness and lack of direction in the recent British riots, contrasting it with protests in the Arab world, where &quot;a focus and self-awareness that comes from those countries&apos; recent history of anti-colonial struggle has been transmitted from one generation to the next&quot;. But this year could still be remembered as one in which, after many decades of moribund political and economic realities, a new narrative began to form. As Andreou points out, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the philosopher who coined the term &quot;Black Swan event&quot; \u2013 denoting a hugely consequential event that is utterly unpredictable and can only be explained afterwards \u2013 was recently asked by Jeremy Paxman whether the violence on the streets of Athens fell into that category. He demurred \u2013 and said that the real Black Swan event was that more people weren&apos;t rioting elsewhere.

They think that a deal is unachievable and the two peoples are incapable of the necessary compromises. They are calling for an abandonment of the two-state paradigm, or for the international community to impose a solution at the UN. Some even think the conflict can be resolved by boycotting Israel in order to bully it into accepting all of the demands of the Palestinians. But those who have lost faith in a negotiated two-state solution are underestimating the capacity of Palestinians and Israelis to look beyond their current disagreements and conceive of a better shared future. A recent event facilitated by Bicom illustrated this. We organised an unusual roundtable discussion in Israel for a group of young media professionals from the UK. The guest speakers were a young leader of the centre-right Israeli Likud party from Tel Aviv and a young Palestinian activist from the Fatah party in Ramallah. The two had an unusual story to tell. They had met in the context of an internationally sponsored forum for young Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Despite their deeply entrenched and firmly opposed personal and national narratives, they had struck up a close friendship, clearly visible in the warmth they showed for one another. Over the course of the discussion each of them spoke about the conflict from their perspective. Their versions of the present reality and how we got here were starkly different. But they did not argue with one another. They listened respectfully to each other&apos;s stories. The Likud activist spoke for both of them when he told the British participants, &quot;I don&apos;t expect the other side to accept my version of events, but it is important that we each learn to understand how the other side sees the situation. On this basis we can build a shared future.&quot; This is the key to resolving the conflict. Both sides have core strategic concerns that need to be reconciled. Neither side is going to abandon its national narrative or its claim to self-determination. What these two had learned through meeting one another was that the conflict cannot be resolved by one side forcing the other to accept its claims. The only way to solve the conflict is if each side comes to understand the other side&apos;s claims, and finds ways to reconcile competing demands through dialogue and negotiation. This will require considerable flexibility and difficult concessions on both sides. But these concessions can be made if leaders on both sides can convince their publics that the deal represents the best available option. A former Israeli negotiator told me: &quot;You need to think about the other side&apos;s victory speech.&quot; In other words, peace cannot be a zero-sum game. In order to reach a final status accord, each side needs to think about how the other side will sell the deal to its constituents. The leaders on both sides need to be able to set out a vision for a post-agreement future, which will be better for their children than the status quo. From my long experience of Israel, I have learned that most Israelis would be ready to back the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. This is consistently confirmed by opinion polls. However, they can only be sold on the deal if their core requirements are met in return. In essence, in return for Israel giving up its control of the occupied territories, the Palestinians have to give up their claim to the territory which is now Israel. This means there cannot be a mass return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. This is why the Palestinian attempt to have their claims endorsed at the UN is not only misdirected, but also dangerous. For negotiations to have the best chance of success, both sides need to go in with as few constraints as possible. Each side will bring demands, but they must be prepared to moderate them. If the UN endorses maximalist Palestinian positions, it will make it harder for them to compromise on them around the negotiating table. As well as complicating future negotiations, the Palestinian leadership is creating expectations among its public that will not be matched by real change on the ground. Two states remain the only conceivable solution that balances the needs of Israelis and Palestinians. The international community must promote an environment which makes that negotiated two-state solution more likely. They must avoid steps at the UN which will make it harder for either side to make painful but necessary compromises in the future.", "publicationDate": "2011-08-17T09:14:25Z", "title": "Understanding is key to a two-state future for Israelis and Palestinians | Lorna Fitzsimons", "sentences": ["The guest speakers were a young leader of the centre-right Israeli Likud party from Tel Aviv and a young Palestinian activist from the Fatah party in Ramallah."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/17/two-state-israelis-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Protest"], "article": "Organisers of the tent protests which have enthralled Israel for more than a month have called off demonstrations planned for this weekend following the attacks in the south of the country.

According to Iranian media, Majid Jamali-Fashi, 26, admitted killing Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, a particle physicist who Iran says was involved in the country&apos;s nuclear programme, Jamali-Fashi confessed to having attached a remote-control bomb to a motorcycle parked on the street, which detonated and killed Ali-Mohammadi while he was leaving home for work in January 2010. But seasoned observers questioned whether it was a show trial intended to cover-up Iran&apos;s embarrassment over its failure to protect its nuclear scientists. The extent of Ali-Mohammadi&apos;s involvement in Iran&apos;s nuclear programme is still not clear. At the time of the assassination, some expressed skepticism over claims that he was a nuclear scientist, saying that he had voiced strong support for the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi in the past. But it emerged later that Ali-Mohammadi could have been associated with Tehran&apos;s nuclear ambitions after his name was seen on a list of an Iranian team at the Sesame Council, a joint-project involving different countries including Israel which runs a particle accelerator in Jordan. Prosecutors in the case accused Israel and its intelligence agency, Mossad, of being behind &quot;terrorist groups&quot; trained to kill Iranian scientists in order to halt the country&apos;sIran&apos;s nuclear programme. &quot;The defendant had travelled to Israel to receive training from Mossad and had agreed to assassinate Dr Ali-Mohammadi in return for $120,000,&quot; the English-language newspaper Tehran Times quoted the city&apos;s chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, as saying. According to the semi-official Fars news agency, Jamali-Fashi said he was also assigned to carry out five other &quot;terrorist operations&quot; after the assassination. Ali-Mohammadi&apos;s family asked for death penalty for the accused, according to Fars, but Judge Abol-Ghassem Salavati said sentencing would be issued in due course. Jamali-Fashi had previously appeared in a TV programme in January in which he confessed to having been hired by Israel and trained at a military base outside Tel Aviv before being dispatched to Iran to kill Ali-Mohammadi. The programme described him as &quot;the main element&quot; of any Israeli-trained network involved in the assassination. At the time of the broadcast, Iran&apos;s intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, said Iran had uncovered &quot;a US-backed Israeli operation&quot; and arrested more than 10 people with links to Mossad. In response to Jamali-Fashi&apos;s TV confessions, Israel denied any connection with him. In recent years, Iran&apos;s nuclear programme has experienced a series of setback after the assassinations of its scientists and the Stuxnet computer worm, which was designed to sabotage its atomic facilities and halt its uranium-enrichment programme. The malware is believed to have targeted a control system used in Iran&apos;s nuclear sites in July last year. In November, Majid Shahriari, a nuclear scientist, was killed and Fereidoon Abbasi Davani, Iran&apos;s current atomic chief, survived assassination in two similar attacks to the one which Ali-Mohammadi died. In July, an Iranian academic, Darioush Rezaeinejad was shot dead by gunmen riding on motorcycles. He was initially described by state media as a nuclear scientist but officials later denied he was involved in Iran&apos;s atomic programme. Rumours spread that at the time that the 35-year-old masters student might have been mistakenly killed instead of a nuclear scientist with a similar name, Darioush Rezaei.", "publicationDate": "2011-08-23T19:27:31Z", "title": "Man pleads guilty to assassinating Iranian nuclear scientist", "sentences": ["Jamali-Fashi had previously appeared in a TV programme in January in which he confessed to having been hired by Israel and trained at a military base outside Tel Aviv before being dispatched to Iran to kill Ali-Mohammadi."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/23/iran-nuclear-scientist-assassination-trial"}, {"tags": ["Muammar Gaddafi", "YouTube", "Libya", "Music", "Internet", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "Technology", "World news"], "article": "     For all the economic, sociological and philosophical pearls of wisdom he cast before the world in The Green Book, Muammar Gaddafi has always been remarkably tight-lipped about the revolutionary applications of a phat beat and some lyrical rhyming.

The Zenga Zenga song, as it has been dubbed, is the brainchild of Noy Alooshe, a 32-year-old satirist, musician and journalist from Tel Aviv.

The resulting video, which quickly became an online phenomenon, came to be known as the Zenga Zenga song in an apparent corruption of the Arabic word zanqa, meaning alleyway. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it would get this kind of response,&quot; Alooshe told the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &quot;It was supposed to be for fun.&quot; As the song went viral all along Arab Street, Alooshe, whose grandparents were from Tunisia, yielded to requests to remove the scantily clad dancing girl from the video. In any case, she was hardly the reason people were watching. &quot;It&apos;s really strange that someone like Qaddafi made me a YouTube star,&quot; said Alooshe. &quot;This is the real revolution.&quot; Although the video has now been viewed more than 5m times, not everyone appears to appreciate its humorous intent.

I&apos;d go further and say that they are the best team ever. Like, ever. Brazil &apos;70 can&apos;t have been all that good because we get shown the same three clips over and over. Holland late-70s, Liverpool 70s, Milan late-80s, the Real Madrid of Puskas&apos;s time and others may have been good, but nobody comes close to the combination of proper passing football whilst actually winning things, as Barca do. Surely nobody can object?&quot; - Grant McPhee. &quot;By merely peeing on the floor, Bonnie the dog didn&apos;t really do what might become known as a Depardieu (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters). To achieve that she would have had to fill a plastic water bottle while strapped in to a first-class aeroplane seat and then (depending on which report one believes) either continue peeing thus causing the bottle to overflow on to the floor, or simply spill the bottle on the floor. Perhaps the Fiver could develop this into a challenge for priveleged readers&apos; dogs on their way home from Big Cup away legs this season?&quot; - Tim Bene. &quot;Can I be one of 1,057 Bible-toting pedants to point out that Jesus would have had a hard time fixing anything in Sodom on a wet Wednesday (yesterday&apos;s Fiver), given that His Dad had destroyed the city a good while before he was born?&quot; - Mark Rae (and one other Bible-toting pedant).

BITS AND BOBS 17 June 2011: Harry Redknapp says Scott Parker would be too expensive for Tottenham to sign. 26 August 2011: West Ham confirm they are in talks with Tottenham over the sale of Scott Parker. Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers boss Ally McCoist has been musing on the early end to Scotland&apos;s European campaign. &quot;Life would be pretty boring if it was a bed of roses all the time,&quot; he cheered. &quot;It&apos;s a rollercoaster and we took a bit of a dip last night and it was a sore one. But we&apos;ve got a real opportunity to regroup and get ready for Aberdeen.&quot; The opening weekend of the Serie A season has been delayed after the players decided to strike when talks over a new collective bargaining agreement broke down. BASTA CALCIO! Meanwhile, Renzo Ulivieri, the head of the Italian Managers&apos; Association, has chained himself to the railings of the Football Federation&apos;s HQ in protest at a perceived fall in coaching certificate standards. &quot;This is the real scandal of the summer,&quot; he growled. Thomas Vermaelen is a doubt for Arsenal&apos;s trip to Manchester United on Sunday. Anyone got Igors Stepanovs&apos; number? &quot;Going to have to make a decision today, its [sic] only fair to all parties,&quot; tweets the QPR-bound Joseph Barton. As the Fiver likes to say, the quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim. Scotland captain Darren Fletcher has returned to Craig Levein&apos;s squad for the Euro 2012 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Lithuania. Full squad: Gilks (Blackpool), McGregor (Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers), Turner (Preston); Bardsley (Sunderland), Berra (Wolves), Caldwell (Wigan), Crainey (Blackpool), Hanley (Blackeye Rovers), Hutton (Tottenham), Whittaker (Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers), Shortbread McFiver (Fiver Towers), Wilson (Liverpool); Adam (Liverpool), Bannan (Aston Villa), Brown (Queen&apos;s Celtic), Cowie (Cardiff), Dorrans (West Brom), Fletcher (Manchester United), Forrest (Queen&apos;s Celtic), Morrison (West Brom), Naismith (Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers), Robson (Middlesbrough), Snodgrass (Nasty Leeds); Goodwillie (Blackeye Rovers), Mackail-Smith (Brighton), Miller (Cardiff). And if you had money on Bradford boss Peter Jackson in the League Two sack race, go and collect. &quot;No one had an idea,&quot; parped midfielder Michael Flynn. &quot;As I left the club, I had a joke with the gaffer as he was in his shirt and trousers. I asked if he had a date and he just said, &apos;No, a board meeting&apos;.&quot; STILL WANT MORE? The legendary David Lacey waxes lyrical about why the new season is immediately hamstrung by the imminence of the transfer deadline. If pictures of Nigel Winterburn&apos;s wild 1980s barnet get you going, then the Joy of Six: early-season leaders is for you. Within 20 minutes of Paolo Bandini&apos;s Serie A 2011-12 preview going live, a strike for the opening weekend was confirmed. We&apos;re saying nothing. Another day, another Shamrock Rovers blog. Oh. Here it is, anyway. It&apos;s not exactly Big Sam at Camber Sands, but still, it&apos;s the Football League weekender.

The protesters, who aim to &quot;inspire a national squatting movement&quot;, unveiled Jerusalem&apos;s first &quot;People&apos;s House&quot; on Saturday night, occupying an abandoned state-owned building close to prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s official residence, where several thousand demonstrators called for social justice and better living standards. The four storey building in the city centre has been empty for 15 years, say demonstrators. It is owned by the Jewish National Fund (JNF), which was established by Zionists more than a century ago to buy up land in Palestine. Plans to turn it into a hotel more than a decade ago never came to fruition. A coalition of activists broke in through a back window on Friday, cleared away rubble and set about transforming the interior in anticipation of Saturday night&apos;s launch. About 200 Israelis came to celebrate the building&apos;s occupation on Saturday night, according to the organisers. The flicker of hundreds of candles lit up poems inspired by the social justice protests which were daubed in white paint on the walls. Esther Witt, one of the activists behind the initiative, said the political statement was designed to put pressure on the government to deal with state-owned buildings that stand empty and encourage the thousands of foreign owners of &quot;ghost apartments&quot; in Israel to rent them out. &quot;We&apos;re trying to make a point \u2013 this building could easily house four families but it has stood empty for 15 years,&quot; said Witt, a special needs teaching assistant and mother of two young children. &quot;We want those people who own apartments in Israel but only come to the country for two weeks a year to feel that if they leave their apartment empty, it&apos;ll be squatted, and so it&apos;s in everyone&apos;s interest if they rent them out instead.&quot; The takeover of the building followed two similar &quot;guerrilla occupations&quot; in Tel Aviv. Last Monday, dozens of housing protesters occupied a building owned by the Tel Aviv Municipality before being evicted by police the next morning. And on Friday afternoon, protesters broke into and briefly occupied another mainly empty municipal building in the city, hanging protest signs on its exterior and leaving before police arrived. Discontent with spiralling rents, high house prices, the exorbitant costs of education and raising children, as well as a range of other social issues, has seen a national social justice movement blossom since the first &quot;tent city&quot; protest in Tel Aviv on 14 July. Mass rallies have been held in cities and towns across Israel since then, with an estimated 300,000 people taking to the streets on 6 August in the largest demonstrations over social issues seen in the country. Unimpressed by the government&apos;s establishment of a committee of experts to consider the demands, activists are calling for a &quot;million-man&quot; march in 50 cities next Saturday. However, demonstrations in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and a handful of other towns and cities on Saturday night saw a markedly lower turnout than in previous protests, with about 20,000 Israelis taking part, according to local media reports.

The report notes that Israel has not satisfactorily explained how it is that most of the dead were shot multiple times, including in the back, and at close range. But it also said the organisers of the flotilla acted &quot;recklessly&quot; in attempting to breach the blockade. The report is expected to be released on Friday after months of delay because of a dispute between Israel and Turkey over its contents and Ankara&apos;s demand for an apology from Israel for the deaths of its citizens. Turkey&apos;s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, gave Israel one day to make the apology or face a further deterioration in relations with what had been the Jewish state&apos;s closest ally in the region. Turkey has already withdrawn its ambassador from Tel Aviv. The Israeli government has repeatedly refused to make a full apology, although it has offered to express regret, saying it had a legal right to defend itself by maintaining the blockade of Gaza to prevent weapons reaching the Palestinian enclave. The 105-page report by a four person committee chaired by Sir Geoffrey Palmer, a former prime minister of New Zealand, backs Israel on that point and said it had the right to board six ships carrying protesters and humanitarian supplies. &quot;Israel faces a real threat to its security from militant groups in Gaza. The naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law,&quot; the UN concluded. The report&apos;s authors \u2013 who also include Alvaro Uribe, a former president of Colombia, and representatives Israel and Turkey \u2013 went on to criticise the flotilla&apos;s organisers, a Turkish aid group. &quot;Although people are entitled to express their political views, the flotilla acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade. The majority of the flotilla participants had no violent intentions, but there exist serious questions about the conduct, true nature and objectives of the flotilla organisers,&quot; it said. The UN panel accepts Israel&apos;s assertion that its forces faced armed resistance when they boarded one of the ships, the Turkish-registered Mavi Marmara. &quot;Israeli Defence Forces personnel faced significant, organised and violent resistance from a group of passengers when they boarded the Mavi Marmara requiring them to use force for their own protection. Three soldiers were captured, mistreated, and placed at risk by those passengers. Several others were wounded,&quot; it said. But the report said the Israeli force&apos;s response was excessively violent in killing nine of the passengers and wounding many more. &quot;No satisfactory explanation has been provided to the panel by Israel for any of the nine deaths. Forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range has not been adequately accounted for in the material presented by Israel,&quot; it said. The report goes on to criticise Israel for the &quot;significant mistreatment of passengers&quot; after they were taken off the ships including physical abuse, harassment, intimidation and unjustified confiscation of property. Israel will be pleased that the report backs the legality of its naval blockade \u2013 a move that Turkey is deeply unhappy with. But Israel will be embarrassed by the suggestion that its forces appear to have summarily executed some of the pro-Palestinian activists. The report recommends that Israel make &quot;an appropriate statement of regret&quot; and pay compensation to Turkey. Ankara wants more, including a full apology, before it returns its ambassador to its embassy in Tel Aviv. It also wants the blockade lifted or eased. Earlier this week, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, proposed that the Palmer report&apos;s release be postponed once again while the diplomatic confrontation with Turkey is resolved. But Ankara rejected the move. Davutoglu told the Turkish newspaper, Today Zaman, that his government is not prepared to wait any longer. &quot;For us the deadline is the day the UN report gets released, or we resort to Plan B,&quot; Davutoglu said, but did not elaborate on what the alternate Turkish route would be. Davutoglu did not say what &quot;Plan B&quot; may be. However, the foreign minister recently told a news conference: &quot;If the Palmer Report does not contain an apology, both sides and the United States know what we will do&quot;. The report says that &quot;the events of 31 May 2010 should never have taken place as they did and strenuous efforts should be made to prevent the occurrence of such incidents in the future&quot;. That appears to be what happened when Greece prevented a second flotilla of eight ships from leaving its ports for Gaza in July. After several of the ships were put out of action by sabotage, including having propeller shafts cut, the remaining vessels were blocked by the Greek authorities under considerable diplomatic pressure.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-01T22:26:51Z", "title": "UN investigation backs Israel's naval blockade of Gaza", "sentences": ["Turkey has already withdrawn its ambassador from Tel Aviv.", "Ankara wants more, including a full apology, before it returns its ambassador to its embassy in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/un-investigation-backs-israel-blockade-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Protest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "     Hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Saturday night in Israel&apos;s biggest ever demonstration to demand social justice, a lower cost of living and a clear government response to the concerns of an increasingly squeezed middle class. About 430,000 people took part in marches and rallies across the country, according to police. The biggest march was in Tel Aviv, where up to 300,000 took part. There was an unprecedented 50,000-strong protest in Jerusalem, and 40,000 marched in Haifa. There were smaller protests in dozens of other towns and cities. It had been billed as the &quot;march of the million&quot; but organisers said a turnout matching the 300,000-strong demonstrations four weeks ago would be a triumph. Israel&apos;s population is 7.7 million. Saturday&apos;s demonstrations followed 50 days of protests that have rattled political leaders and led commentators and analysts to ask whether a new social movement would transform Israeli domestic politics for the next generation. The movement, which has the support of about 90% of the population according to opinion polls, began when a small group of activists erected tents in Tel Aviv&apos;s prosperous Rothschild Boulevard in protest at high rents and house prices. Tent cities mushroomed across the country and protesters rallied behind the slogan: &quot;The people demand social justice.&quot; Among the issues raised were the cost of housing, transport, childcare, food and fuel; the low salaries paid to many professionals, including doctors and teachers; tax reform; and welfare payments. The government established a committee led by the economics professor Manuel Trajtenberg to examine the protesters&apos; demands, which is due to report later this month. Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday night blew whistles and banged drums as they marched in a carnival atmosphere to a large square for a rally. Residents hung banners from balconies and cheered as they passed. &quot;We are the new Israelis,&quot; the student leader Itzik Shmuli told the rally. &quot;And the new Israelis want only one simple thing: to live with dignity in this country.&quot; He added: &quot;Tonight we make history again. The people are supporting a protest started by the young people and, a week after the protest was proclaimed over, we are on the verge of breaking another record. From now on the government knows that at any given moment Israelis can return to the streets and must therefore deliver the goods.&quot; Daphni Leef, one of the organisers of the original tent protest, said: &quot;This summer is the great summer of the new Israeli hope born of despair, alienation and impossible gaps \u2026 The Israeli society has reached its red line, and has gotten up and said: &apos;No more.&apos; This is the miracle of the summer of 2011.&quot; Under a homemade banner saying &quot;Walk like an Egyptian&quot;, Ruti Hertz, 34, a journalist, said that until this summer people had been privately ashamed of their inability to make ends meet. &quot;Each person was lonely in their situation, thinking it&apos;s my own problem.&quot; That had changed with the protests. She said that she and her teacher husband, Roi, were living on the same income as when they met 10 years ago. &quot;We don&apos;t ask for much, just to be able to finish the month without taking from our parents.&quot; Roi&apos;s monthly take-home pay of 5,500 shekels (\u00a3940) went on nursery fees for their two young daughters, she said. Vered Cohen Nitsan, a primary school teacher from Netanya, said she had joined the march &quot;to protest, to support the people of my country and [because] I wish my children will have an easier life in the future&quot;. She added: &quot;For years, you think you just have to work harder and struggle. And now people start to talk to one another and you see it&apos;s not your personal problem.&quot; At a rally in Haifa, Shahin Nasser, an Israeli-Arab, said: &quot;Today we are changing the rules of the game. No more coexistence based on hummus and fava beans. What is happening here is true coexistence, when Arabs and Jews march together shoulder to shoulder calling for social justice and peace. We&apos;ve had it.&quot; The protests have been criticised by some on the left for not paying more attention to the discrimination suffered by Israeli-Arabs, who make up 20% of Israel&apos;s population, or Israel&apos;s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Weekly demonstrations, whose turnout had been steadily building, were suspended for two weeks after an attack by militants near the Egyptian-Israeli border in which eight Israelis were killed. Some commentators suggested that the movement had lost its momentum. Protest organisers said the tent cities would be dismantled but the movement would continue with other actions.

Ten years on, much of that early reaction to the day America realised, as New York magazine put it on the fifth anniversary, that &quot;there really are ideological-cum-religious zealots out there intent on slaughtering us in large numbers&quot;, now looks exaggerated \u2013 albeit understandably. 11 September 2001 didn&apos;t change the world for ever. The world is, however, a different place. So the question is: which of the many changes are genuine consequences of 9/11? One way of answering might be to ask what the world would be like if 9/11 had not happened. There are obvious objections to counterfactual history, as speculating &quot;what if?&quot; is known by historians, if only because, as any of them will tell you, causality isn&apos;t easy to establish with certainty even in conventional historical research. But it does throw up some neat ideas \u2013 not least that in the big scheme of things, 9/11, horrific and cataclysmic as it was, may not have changed much at all. If the al-Qaida plotters had not pulled off 9/11, many security and foreign policy experts believe it would only have been a matter of time before they managed something else. Alternatively, a steady accumulation of smaller attacks \u2013 an embassy in Africa here, a warship in the Red Sea there \u2013 may have provoked a large-scale US response. So an attack on Afghanistan (with all its disastrous consequences for neighbouring Pakistan, and hence, arguably, for the choices made by the 7/7 London bombers) was more or less on the cards, with or without 9/11. Crucially, Iraq too may well have come under attack regardless. &quot;There&apos;s quite a strong argument,&quot; says Anatol Lieven of King&apos;s College London&apos;s department of war studies, &quot;that the Bush administration would have tried to invade and occupy Iraq anyway. &quot;The question is, would they have got away with it? Would they have been able to win over the more moderate Republicans, get it through the Senate, rally support at the UN, convince Tony Blair? &quot;I think Iraq would certainly have been more difficult for the US without 9/11, because Bush explicitly made that Saddam-al-Qaida link. But I think it would have tried.&quot; Assuming the neocons did carry the day, &quot;much of what has happened since would obviously have happened anyway&quot;, Lieven points out. &quot;The extreme anger of the Muslim world, the blow to US military prestige, the rise of Iran \u2013 all of that would have happened.&quot; Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, feels it is questionable whether the US hawks would have won the day on Iraq without the &quot;extreme shock&quot; of 9/11. But he notes that much else in the broader world picture would have happened regardless. &quot;Economic growth, continuing globalisation, the rise of a giant consumer class \u2026 the twin towers and al-Qaida barely even dented that,&quot; he says. &quot;The debt crisis would have happened, too. &quot;The fact that America had a $700bn defence budget, was spending $200bn, $250bn a year in Iraq and Afghanistan, that was a massive additional drain. But the underlying economic and financial causes were unrelated. And the whole Arab spring really had nothing to do with 9/11. &quot;I&apos;m struggling to think of a single thing that I wouldn&apos;t see today if the twin towers hadn&apos;t happened.&quot; It was not 9/11 but the invasion of Iraq that set in motion the real changes: the &quot;emboldened&quot; state of Iran; the significant hardening and legitimising of anti-American attitudes in Turkey; the fact that the leaders of &quot;rogue states&quot; such as Venezuela or Iran could pull off the unlikely feat of &quot;presenting themselves as much-maligned forces for stability&quot;. And it was the war in Iraq, notes Toby Dodge, of the LSE and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, that imposed such serious and lasting strain on transatlantic relations, and on relations within Europe. &quot;If the transatlantic relationship was born in 1945, it died on 9/11. The fact [is] that Le Monde could say on its front page, &apos;We&apos;re all Americans now,&apos; and that the US could then so completely squander that with bombastic, imperialist incompetence,&quot; he said. Other major post-9/11 winners, says Lieven, include China, which avoided the consequences of &quot;a very gung-ho, almost McCarthyite anti-Chinese agenda&quot; when Bush came to power to &quot;benefit enormously from the fact that the US was spending itself into the ground on military hardware that was never going to be a threat to China&quot;. And if the Bush White House had not been occupied with Iraq, it might not have resisted attacking North Korea, Lieven speculates. &quot;That would have led it into a confrontation with China.&quot; In fact one of the greatest victims of the US response to 9/11, argues Dodge, was the country&apos;s own strategic focus, which &quot;just got completely skewed&quot;. Pakistan was neglected. Israel was neglected (&quot;The road to Tel Aviv and Ramallah ran through Baghdad&quot;). And so too, adds Niblett, were Latin America (&quot;Bush was the guy who was going to open up Mexico&quot;) and Asia. &quot;Everything became focused on this one thing,&quot; Niblett says. &quot;The US simply withdrew from pretty much everything else. As a result, Washington was largely absent at a senior level from the rest of the world, at a time when the rest of the world was changing, and growing, very fast indeed. That&apos;s not made things easy for Obama.&quot; The pendulum swings, though. Niblett explains: &quot;The fact that 9/11 was such a massive attack, that it drew such a massive, big-stick response, and that America saw that response fail \u2026 The US was, after all, checked, even in some ways defeated in Iraq. &quot;Current US foreign policy under [Barack] Obama, altogether more nuanced, more restrained, is a product of that. There&apos;s an awareness that the big stick approach doesn&apos;t always work.&quot; Which is probably, in the grand scheme of things, a good thing. Because as Lieven suggests, America under Bush was spoiling for a fight. &quot;It&apos;s worth examining the agenda with which Bush came to power and which he pursued in the first eight months,&quot; he says. &quot;Anti-Russia, anti-China, anti-Iran, anti-North Korea \u2026 If a &apos;non-9/11&apos; had made Iraq impossible, it&apos;s perfectly possible the US would have got into equally terrible trouble. Just in different places.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-09-09T18:00:16Z", "title": "Was 9/11 really the day that changed the world for ever?", "sentences": ["Israel was neglected (&quot;The road to Tel Aviv and Ramallah ran through Baghdad&quot;)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/9-11-changed-world-forever"}, {"tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2011", "Georgia rugby union team", "England rugby union team", "Scotland rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Rugby World Cup"], "article": "     So, Georgian rugby. Tell me about it. Passing judgment on England and Scotland&apos;s next opponents is tricky, given that no one outside Georgia \u2013 or possibly France, where a number of their forwards play \u2013 knows a damned thing about them. How come Georgia even play rugby? It&apos;s a hangover from the USSR (Stalin was a decent loosehead, etc), when rugby was surprisingly widespread in the armed forces and the universities and Georgian teams thrived. Rugby also bears a convenient similarity to lelo, a Georgian folk game based on the usual co-operative violence and the manhandling of an inflated bladder from one end of a village to another. Who do they like to beat? Russia, even when they&apos;re not actually at war with them and particularly given the burgeoning professional game there. Georgia have not lost to their neighbours since 1993 but the gap is narrowing. They could, technically, meet in New Zealand. In the semi-finals. So they won&apos;t. It&apos;s all about the forwards, isn&apos;t it? Up to a point. Search for the monstrous Montpellier flanker Mamuka &quot;Gorgodzilla&quot; Gorgodze on YouTube (he&apos;s played a Top 14 final and he hits like 10 10-tonne trucks driven downhill) and nod wisely about how Davit Kubriashvili is such a strong scrummaging tighthead (as if there were any other kind) that he keeps the world&apos;s highest-paid player, the former All Black Carl Hayman, out of Toulon&apos;s team. Their coach is Richie Dixon, a Scot, so they will ruck the bejesus out of all-comers. But the backs can play a bit too \u2013 this correspondent met the Georgians in Tel Aviv 10 years ago (which counts as expertise) and the big wing Irakli Machkhaneli was the best player in the late, lamented Holy Land Sevens, which included some Fijians.

Despite opposition from Israel and the United States, a UN vote now looks inevitable. The Guardian and the Forward have brought together two experts to take part in an online Q&amp;A to answer your questions about what may prove a game-changing development in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.      Hussein Ibish is a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, a frequent contributor to US newspapers and magazines, and author of What&apos;s Wrong with the One-State Agenda? Why Ending the Occupation and Peace with Israel is Still the Palestinian National Goal.       Yossi Klein Halevi is an Israeli journalist and writer. A fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute, he is Israel correspondent for the New Republic. \u2022 This article is closed for comments. This thread is open for questions while the Q&amp;A is live Forward user Lucy asks: What real harm is there in recognizing the national aspirations of our neighbors? Skip the symbolism, the desire for reciprocity, and just answer specifically: How would Palestinian recognition render Israel&apos;s borders any (more or) less defensible? Its military any (more or) less dominant? Its settlements policy any (less or) more divisive? Its economy any (more or) less vital? Its people any (more or) less secure? And its status in the world community of nations any (less or) more isolated?  Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      We already have recognised Palestinian national aspirations. Even Netanyahu has accepted a two-state solution. Other Israeli prime ministers have been explicit in affirming the legitimacy \u2013 not just political expediency \u2013 of a Palestinian state. The question I think you&apos;re asking is: should Israel recognize the Palestinian UN initiative? I think not \u2013 because this is about circumventing negotiations and rendering Israeli security needs irrelevant. What the international community is saying here is that it&apos;s more important to create Arab state number 23 and Muslim state number 58 than it is to ensure the security needs, perhaps the long-term viability, of the lone Jewish state. That is an expression of contempt for Israel. Nor is the UN \u2013 which routinely condemns Israel more than all other countries combined \u2013 a suitable venue for trying to heal the conflict. We&apos;ve come a very long away from the old Israeli position opposing a two-state solution. Every major party \u2013 including, now, the Likud \u2013 has accepted the principle of a two-state solution. We have few red lines left. One of those must be that this conflict can only be resolved through negotiations. Forward user Ilan asks:  What is your take on the recent statements that &quot;Palestine should be free of Jews&quot;? Obviously it would be unrealistic for settlers to stay in a Palestinian state but the tone of this statement is just bad. As a (Jewish) supporter of the two-state solution, it makes my job that much harder. Hussein Ibish replies:      Many Palestinian leaders have said that Jews should be welcomed in the Palestinian state as residents, citizens, dual citizens or in some other capacity, as long as they agree to live under Palestinian law in a sovereign Palestinian state. This is an important principle that Palestinians should maintain in the best interests of their own society, since Palestine should be pluralistic, democratic and open to citizens and residents of all religions, ethnicities and origins. Palestinian leaders have repeatedly said that &quot;Israeli settlers&quot; cannot remain in Palestine as settlers. This does not mean that Palestine will be free of Jews. However, clearly they cannot continue to be &quot;settlers,&quot; that is to say Israelis living in Palestine under Israeli law and under the jurisdiction of the Israeli state. Extra territorial jurisdiction for Israel over the Jews and Israelis living in an independent, sovereign Palestine negates the sovereignty and independence of that Palestinian state. But the principle that Jews must be welcome in a Palestinian state is an important value for the Palestinians themselves. I would point out the following examples that demonstrate some of the numerous instances in which Palestinian officials have agreed to this principle: In 2009 the then chief Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Qurei, told his Israeli counterpart, Tzipi Livni, that Jews would be free to live under Palestinian rule. Palestinian prime minister: Jews would be welcome in future state. One final note: I&apos;m not sure any Israeli government would actually agree to leave Jewish Israelis inside a Palestinian state because I doubt they would want the responsibility for the political pressure for protecting them if they came into conflict or other difficulties with their Palestinian neighbors in the context of Palestinian sovereignty. Guardian user Atif asks: Israel already routinely flouts international law and UN resolutions, while the United States continually provides it with a veto at the Security Council. What difference will &apos;observer status&apos; (which is what will be achieved because the US will veto full membership) make beyond the symbolism? Hussein Ibish replies:      My own view is that non-member observer state status in the General Assembly will, in fact, largely be symbolic. My concern is that it could come at very real costs in terms of a threatened cutoff of US aid, which numerous members of Congress especially in the House are pushing for, not only to the PA but also to all UN and other international agencies that provide any upgraded recognition whatsoever to the Palestinians. My view is that this would be a disastrous, self-defeating response and take what might be a diplomatically difficult situation at the UN and turn it into a combustible and potentially disastrous and unmanageable situation for all parties on the ground. The most appealing thing about being a nonmember state to Palestinians is that historically, apart from the Vatican, there have been 16 such observers at the UN. If you account for the unification of Germany and Vietnam, all 16 are now full UN members. So in that sense, such an upgrade is very appealing to any people aspiring to full UN membership. However, a symbolic victory with little practical benefits and enormous costs needs to be very carefully considered in terms of its long-term value to the national interest. Guardian user SacredScreed asks: Israeli officials have claimed that the Palestinians should engage in further talks in order to determine the outlook of a Palestinian state. But what is wrong with Palestinians looking to the international community for multilateral talks and multilateral recognition? Surely this is the right and proper thing for any country to do when seeking to join the United Nations? Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      The real question, it seems to me, isn&apos;t the abstract right of the Palestinian national movement to turn to the UN for empowerment, but how the international community should oversee the emergence of a Palestinian state. Should that happen through negotiations or an imposed solution on Israel? For Israelis, the crucial question is what is the goal of the Palestinian national movement. Is it to create a state that will live in peace with its neighbor, Israel? Or does it see a state in the West Bank and Gaza as a first step to the gradual unraveling of the Jewish state \u2013 perhaps through demographic means, via &quot;right of return&quot;? Read the Palestinian media \u2013 Fatah as well as Hamas \u2013 and the answer is the latter. Most Israelis don&apos;t believe that the Palestinian national movement seeks a permanent two-state solution. The international community, by and large, has not taken those fears seriously. And in unilaterally seeking to impose a solution to the conflict, the UN would allow the Palestinian leadership to bypass negotiations that would offer Israel the kind of security guarantees on which its long-term viability could depend. Guardian user gucchipiggy asks: Is there an argument that a US veto is actually the desired outcome for Palestinians (if not the PA)? My sense is that large scale civil unrest may be the results \u2013 perhaps across the Arab world \u2013 and that this would be the best possible method of focusing world attention on solving this issue urgently. The PA might well get swept away in the process, but I doubt anyone apart from Israel and Ramallah&apos;s finer restaurants will weep at that prospect. Hussein Ibish replies:      I do not believe that a losing confrontation with the United States in the Security Council over the issue of statehood is a desired or desirable outcome for the Palestinians. Recall that in February, the Palestinians had a losing confrontation with the United States in the Security Council over the issue of settlements, after which the Israelis had more or less a free hand in settlement activity until some of the more recent extremely provocative announcements such as Har Homa C, a planned settlement expansion that would gravely change the strategic landscape, especially regarding the future of occupied East Jerusalem. As for another Palestinian uprising, I think it is extremely unlikely that even if it began in a nonviolent manner it would remain nonviolent because Israeli occupation forces are exercising a system of discipline and control over a subjugated population and would quickly resort to force against large crowds even if they were nonviolent. And, of course, there are many extreme Palestinian groups that would seize on the opportunity to resume conflict. I think that is the very definition of a lose-lose scenario, and I think every step should be taken to avoid it. The most important aspect of doing so is to continue US and international funding to the PA to support Palestinian economic development, institution-building and security cooperation on the ground. I think we should all focus most of our attention on the day-after scenarios rather than whatever happens in New York, because what happens on the ground is much more likely to affect the future for Palestinians and Israelis alike than pieces of paper issued in Turtle Bay. Guardian user figs123 asks: Do you believe the vote for recognition at the UN is targeted to improve the PA&apos;s strength at the table in negotiations with Israel or an attempt to further legitimize the Palestinian authority as the Palestinian representatives (as opposed to Hamas in Gaza)? Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      It&apos;s a tempting perspective. I wish I could be less cynical. But I see this as a move aimed at further isolating Israel and laying the ground for an imposed solution \u2013 the opposite of a negotiating strategy. As for strengthening the PA against Hamas: it&apos;s worth noting that Hamas has condemned the UN vote, which would give credence to your second point. Certainly, Abbas is always looking warily over his shoulder at Hamas. But on bottom, I see this move as a PA attempt to circumvent negotiations and further isolate Israel. Forward user Adam asks: Where does the UN move leave Fayyadism and the largely successful institution building initiatives? And where are the opportunities to continue to empower this movement?  Hussein Ibish replies:      It is imperative that whatever happens in New York does not imperil the successes of the institution-building program adopted by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and his cabinet in August 2009 and which, as you note, has been universally lauded and applauded by multilateral institutions such as the UN, World Bank and the IMF. Preparing for the success of an independent Palestinian state is essential for the Palestinian national interest, as is the institution-building program&apos;s role as an essential adjunct to diplomacy and negotiations and a possible means of alternative momentum when negotiations are stalled, as currently is the case.  The PA is already suffering a financial crisis due to a failure of some countries, especially Arab states, to fulfill their pledges for 2011. Salaries have been cut in half at least once, and may be so again. An austerity regime is being considered to deal with the crisis. Maintaining calm, hope and a positive outlook among the population in the West Bank requires continued institution-building and for the PA to be able to meet payroll upon which more than one million Palestinians are directly dependent. This means funding not only should not be cut, it should be increased. This is also essential to maintaining the all-important security cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli security forces that has restored law and order, curbed terrorism, provided the basis for investment and economic development and is, after all, the sine qua non of governance.  Any talk in Congress or by Israeli officials of &quot;punishing&quot; the Palestinians for whatever they do in the UN by cutting off their funds or, in the case of Israel, withholding their tax revenues, is at least as dangerous for Israel and the United States as it is for the Palestinians. It is imperative that the institution-building program not only continue but expand, as at the moment, it is the main vehicle for hope, progress and momentum towards realizing a two-state solution. Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland asks:     Jonathan Freedland    Which circumstance is more likely to lead to Palestinian frustration, perhaps escalating into violence: a resounding yes from the UN, which then fuels high expectations of on-the-ground change that are subsequently not met \u2013 or a large and influential no vote at the UN, which feeds a sense of disappointment with politics and diplomacy and strengthens those who say only &apos;armed resistance&apos; works? Hussein Ibish replies:      In my view, what is most likely to fuel unrest and possibly violence is not what happens in New York but what happens on the ground in the West Bank. If Palestinians, whether they believe they have had a &quot;success&quot; or a &quot;failure&quot; at the UN, perceive a deterioration in their quality of life, and lose hope in negotiations, international diplomacy and institution-building simultaneously, their despair could boil over into unrest and even violence. A great deal of evidence, first-hand testimony and reportage from on the ground suggests that Palestinians are a lot more concerned about the actual conditions under which they live than about diplomatic developments at the UN. Therefore, continued funding for the PA, the UN and other international institutions that support the quality of life among Palestinians is essential to avoiding not only frustration but despair. My opinion is that this is by far the most important question facing us at the moment, and that all responsible parties should push for continued and indeed increased funding for all these organizations that provide a more decent life and a sense of hope to the Palestinian people. Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      Good question. But unfortunately, entirely theoretical, since there is no chance that the General Assembly will not endorse the application for statehood. So the relevant question is: What will be the impact on Palestinians of a near-universal endorsement of their bid, or of a more divided vote (especially if Europe splits). My sense \u2013 though I&apos;m more interested in Hussein&apos;s answer than mine \u2013 is that if the Palestinian national movement emerges from this vote with virtual unanimity, it could (mis?)interpret that as a licence for an intifada against Israel. A less enthusiastic international endorsement might temper the tendency to self-destructive action. But really, I&apos;m speculating. Forward user Dan Judelson asks: How can Israeli security be realised without the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel? Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      I agree. But that is only half the Israeli predicament. Israeli centrists like me \u2013 and we&apos;re the majority now \u2013 view a Palestinian state in two contradictory ways: as an existential necessity (preserving a Jewish and democratic state, etc) and as an existential threat (missiles on Tel Aviv, etc). The question, then, is how to create a Palestinian state that will help us solve one existential threat without creating a new existential threat. I am frankly maddened by both the Jewish left and right, each of which picks its favorite existential threat that supports its position and ignores the other existential threat that challenges its position. Left and right are guilty of the same sin (and since this is season of penitence before Rosh Hashana, it&apos;s not out of line to speak of sin): selective vision, which trivializes the severity of the Israeli predicament. I know of no other country that faces the agonizing dilemmas that we do, where either choice can lead to our unraveling.  I would have been much happier with your question had it read something like this: How can Israeli security be realized without a Palestinian state? And how can it be realized with a Palestinian state? Forward user Lolo asks: The veto is sure to enflame Arab frustrations with US policy. What kind of damage control will the US attempt in the wake of its veto? Hussein Ibish replies:      That&apos;s a very important question. Not only would a Security Council veto damage the perception of the US in the Arab world, its opposition to everything the Palestinians might try to do to enhance their status at the UN is not playing well with the Arab public. American and other reaction depends on the specific language Palestinians use, of course, and which UN body they approach. But the potential damage is very great. This is particularly unfortunate as in recent months the US has been able to counter traditional anti-American Arab political narratives by siding with the people against dictators in Egypt, Libya and Syria. Arabs have frequently perceive the United States as being interested only in two things in the Middle East: oil and Israel. As a consequence, the United States has been seen as a quintessentially status quo power in the region, opposed almost all political changes and preferring to deal with Arab dictators and autocrats and against Arab democracy and human rights. It&apos;s been much harder to make that case in recent months given US actions in Egypt, Libya and Syria. But strong US opposition to Palestinian moves for greater recognition in the UN could undo all the undermining of that traditional narrative and restore the idea that the United States simply doesn&apos;t care about the basic human rights of Arabs. I&apos;m not sure what kind of damage control to prevent that if the situation is as stark as it could be in the event of a fully-fledged confrontation, followed by self-defeating punitive measures such as cutting off of funds to the PA. Guardian user JennM asks: Does the &apos;Arab spring&apos; frighten Israel, or, on the contrary, does it give hope that the Arab people are seeking to transform their countries into working democracies, as opposed to dictatorships, kingdoms, or theocracies, and does a Palestine state in this context carry the promise of a new, more open and free-thinking Middle East? Hussein Ibish replies:      Israelis appear divided in their opinion of the Arab uprisings, but they should welcome them as peace can be made between governments but only maintained between peoples. Democratic, pluralistic Arab societies should provide for a much more stable regional environment and there is no reason to believe that they will be less amenable to peace with Israel than dictatorships. It is, however, true that Israel will probably have to give more attention to Arab public opinion than it has in the past, and that also is a healthy thing. A Palestinian state, being built on a foundation that lacks existing entrenched ruling elites, secret police and other instruments of repression, could certainly be among the most democratic and pluralistic of Arab societies, as the American Task Force on Palestine has been advocating for many years. Of course, regional unrest has played into the rhetoric of Prime Minister Netanyahu who tends to privilege security above all other values, including peace. However, true security can only come from a condition of peace. All other forms of security are temporary, contingent and ultimately illusory. Peace and reform are the twin pillars for a better Arab world and a better Middle East, and both Arab reform and democracy and peace between Israel and the Palestinians are mutually reinforcing and complementary values that should be pursued simultaneously and along parallel tracks. Yossi Klein Halevi replies:      I&apos;ll try to answer for myself, rather than for Israel. I&apos;m deeply frightened by the potential consequences of the Arab Spring in the short term, and immensely hopeful in the long term. Short term: in the last year we&apos;ve seen the unraveling of whatever alliances/ tacit alliances we&apos;ve had in the region \u2013 Turkey, our most important ally, is now threatening to send warships against us; when the Cairo mob ransacked the Israeli embassy, Egyptian leaders refused to take frantic Israeli calls, and sent in the commandos to rescue besieged embassy staff only after the US intervened. And we haven&apos;t even mentioned the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood. So, short term? Catastrophe wouldn&apos;t be too strong a word. Long term: the Arab Spring could be \u2013 could be (note the Israeli caution even when trying to be optimistic) \u2013 the beginning of an essential process that would allow Arab countries to join the globalizing world, both socially and economically. In a Middle East that examines itself and doesn&apos;t look to blame outsiders for its failures, Israel could find itself finally at home. And my own vision for Israel is that we &quot;return&quot; to the Middle East \u2013 our homecoming will not be complete until we are no longer in &quot;exile&quot; from our neighbors. In that sense, a Palestinian state, founded under the right conditions, could be a crucial part of our homecoming. We need to send the message to the Palestinians and the Arab world generally that we don&apos;t want to occupy another people, that we didn&apos;t come home to deny another people its sense of home, and that our only justification for continuing to remain in the territories is that we view that condition as temporary, until it is safe enough for us to pull out.  Tragically, for us as well as for the Palestinians, I don&apos;t believe we are anywhere near that time. And so in the interim, I would want my government to announce an unconditional and open-ended settlement freeze, that would send the message that we view the occupation as a temporary security necessity, not as a permanent historical claim. But you didn&apos;t ask me about that.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-15T14:01:00Z", "title": "Q&A on Palestinian statehood at the UN | Hussein Ibish and Yossi Klein Halevi", "sentences": ["Israeli centrists like me \u2013 and we&apos;re the majority now \u2013 view a Palestinian state in two contradictory ways: as an existential necessity (preserving a Jewish and democratic state, etc) and as an existential threat (missiles on Tel Aviv, etc)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/15/palestinian-territories-israel"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "UK news", "Gaza", "United Nations"], "article": "For the Zionist movement seeking an independent state of Israel, desire became reality in November 1947, when the General Assembly of the United Nations passed Resolution 181 supporting the establishment of a Jewish state in a partitioned Palestine. That state was declared on 14 May 1948 by David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish people&apos;s council in a Tel Aviv museum. The state of Israel was recognised that evening by President Truman of United States and by the Soviet Union a few days later. More than six decades later, Palestinians, who at first refused to accept the partition plan of the newly minted UN, are seeking similar recognition, firstly in front of the Security Council, asking for their own state based on the 1967 borders free from occupation and settlement by half-a-million Israelis, able to determine their own affairs. The idea of a Palestinian state should be uncontroversial. The United States supports the notion, as does the UK. Indeed, in his 2009 Cairo speech, President Barack Obama insisted: &quot;Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel&apos;s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine&apos;s.&quot; Yet Obama appears determined to veto the move towards Palestinian statehood, while Britain has hinted it is likely to abstain in a Security Council vote. Should the Palestinian request fail at the Security Council, it will then go to the General Assembly, where it seems likely that close to 130 states will vote to support a Palestinian resolution which will be able only to grant an enhanced status to become the equivalent of the Vatican \u2013 an &quot;observer state&quot;. It will, however, be a deeply symbolic moment providing a political, moral and diplomatic victory for the Palestinian cause that the world will find difficult to ignore. It will, significantly, also allow Palestine to become a signatory to the International Criminal Court, permitting it to pursue claims against Israel. While it seems certain that European countries such as France and Spain will support recognition, what is less clear is how the UK will vote in the General Assembly, amid increasing speculation that it might support an enhanced Palestinian status of &quot;observer state&quot; with the right to complain to the International Criminal Court, but only if cases cannot be raised retrospectively. The objections to a Palestinian state \u2013 driven by Israel with the support of the US \u2013 are dangerous and transparently self-serving ones, not least in the midst of an Arab Spring where the US and Europe have tried to present themselves as being supporters of democracy, freedom and justice. The only valid mechanism for the creation of a Palestinian state, this argument goes, is the ongoing peace process, but in fact it is a moribund peace process, which Israel has done its best to smother under the obstructionist leadership of Binyamin Netanyahu. Equally contentious is the claim by some supporters of Israel that in seeking their own state through the declaration of the international community rather than direct talks, Palestinians are seeking to &quot;delegitimise&quot; Israel. The reality is that what those opposing the moves at the UN are demanding is that Palestinians adhere to a non-existent peace process in the good faith that at some time it might be revived in the future under American guidance. They also require Palestinians to refrain from moves that would expose the double standards of the White House and Congress which, while supporting a two-state solution in words, has not only failed to deliver one but now threatens actively to block that outcome. Palestinians, this newspaper believes, are right to be wary of the vague promise that things might be better in a revived peace process at some unspecified time in the future. Despite Oslo and 20 years of peace negotiations, as comparison of maps makes only too clear, the space available for a Palestinian state has only shrunk with each passing decade as Israel has continued to appropriate more land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The actions of the Israeli army in the occupied territories, as the recent book of a decade&apos;s worth of soldiers&apos; testimonies by the servicemen&apos;s group Breaking the Silence has recently demonstrated, have not changed in the desire to control and disrupt ordinary Palestinian life on a daily basis. The truth is that the occupation has become self-sustaining, both for the Israeli army which is implementing the policy, and for a partly militarised society and its politicians, who cannot persuade themselves to bring the occupation to an end. There are risks, inevitably, in taking the issue of statehood to the UN, even in the end if it is only for the upgrading of its observer status. Moves on statehood threaten the long-fractious relationship between Fatah and Hamas, the latter of which opposes the statehood moves, particularly in its stronghold, Gaza, raising the risk of more political violence between the rival factions. There is the danger, too, that the tactic will feel like a damp squib on the day after when Palestinians wake up to see nothing in their lives has changed. But already the strategy has shed important light on a Middle East peace process in which a United States that has long cast itself as an impartial broker (while vetoing every crticism of Israel raised at the UN) is a far from neutral referee, even as its influence in the region has appeared diminished. That new reality was dramatised last week with the explicit threat by Saudi Arabia that its important relationship with the US will be downgraded should America choose to use its veto. As in November 1947, we stand at a crossroads of history. As British ministers deliberate how they will vote in the Security Council, they are confronted with the choice between what is morally right \u2013 supporting a Palestinian state \u2013 and hypocrisy justified in the name of pragmatism. The state of Israel was founded amid risk and uncertainty, which those who supported it fully recognised. They did not argue that a Jewish homeland was possible only in the most ideal and secure conditions. That argument should not be used to further delay Palestinian statehood.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-17T23:20:45Z", "title": "A Palestinian state is a moral right  | Observer editorial", "sentences": ["That state was declared on 14 May 1948 by David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish people&apos;s council in a Tel Aviv museum."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/18/observer-editorial-palestine-statehood"}, {"tags": ["Media", "Al-Jazeera", "CNN", "Fox News", "Israel"], "article": "A Jewish news network is to begin broadcasting from tomorrow.

But the year was 1948 and the state was Israel. Now new officers in the Israeli army are brought to Independence Hall on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv as part of their education in the history of the Jewish state. On the day before Mahmoud Abbas was expected to launch his bid for a Palestinian state, guide Amir Rimon 28, was lecturing a group of young soldiers under one of Rothschild&apos;s broad ficus trees. &quot;We come [here] to remind ourselves of the values on which our state was founded,&quot; he said. The Declaration of Independence, read by David Ben-Gurion 63 years ago, said Palestinians would be equals in the fledgling country. &quot;I think we need to recognise a Palestinian state. Many of the soldiers agree with me \u2013 it&apos;s 50-50,&quot; Rimon added. A recent poll conducted by the Hebrew University found that 70% of Israelis believe that if the UN votes in favour of a Palestinian state, Israel should accept the decision. This is not the position of the Israeli government. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists there can be no peace if the Palestinians follow a unilateral path at the UN. On Wednesday, President Obama threw his weight behind this position. But on Rothschild Boulevard, alternative Israeli voices are being raised. More than 80 prominent Israeli intellectuals gathered outside Independence Hall on Thursday. They were led by author Sefi Rachlevski, to declare their support for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders. &quot;We will have an affect because we represent the real Jewish Zionist heritage and what we&apos;re saying is obvious: Palestine, you don&apos;t need our permission to have a state. Negotiations on its borders can follow,&quot; said Rachlevski. Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer was among signatories to the declaration. He argued that the establishment of two independent neighbouring states was the only solution, and that it is an outcome that would be supported by the majority of Israelis. But he warned it would be met with an armed rebellion by the rightwing, nationalist orthodox minority: &quot;The fear I have of is not so much that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians will march to the 1967 borders. I am afraid of the violent orthodox who have openly established a separate entity [in settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory]. They pose the real danger to Israel.&quot; As the intellectuals launched their protest at Independence Hall, at the opposite end of Rothschild, a few dozen tents and a thriving herb garden were all that remained of Israel&apos;s summer of demos. This was the hub of a nationwide call for change that rallied thousands of Israelis. Palestinian activists note that this unprecedented protest conspicuously ignored the occupation. It proved too divisive an issue for organisers to press upon. Protest leader Dror Shalom, 35, insisted criticism of the occupation was implicit in their challenge to Netanyahu&apos;s rightwing government. The majority of people who protested in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, he said, would extend their calls for justice to Palestinians. Shalom said: &quot;Palestine is a country and it has been for years.

Led by Cynthia Carroll, London-listed Anglo already owns 45% of De Beers but investors say the stake is &quot;undervalued&quot; because De Beers is a private company, which makes it difficult to evaluate. One shareholder said: &quot;Hardly anyone in the City knows how to value a diamond company, but if you ask the experts in Antwerp, Mumbai or Tel Aviv, they will tell you Anglo doesn&apos;t get full credit for its De Beers holding. Buying out the family would be a neat solution.&quot; The Oppenheimers, reputedly worth \u00a33bn, have run De Beers since 1927, and are rumoured to have considered selling their stake, which could be worth $8bn. The government of Botswana is another minority shareholder, with 15%. De Beers&apos;s total worth is put at between $17bn and $18bn, although its complex corporate structure is another factor that makes it difficult to value. Bankers say if Anglo acquired the Oppenheimer stake, or a part of it, it could spin off De Beers into a separately listed company on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. &quot;That way, De Beers would have a &apos;see through&apos; value it doesn&apos;t have today, making it more transparent, as well as easier to understand,&quot; said Cailey Barker, a mining analyst at Numis Securities. Over the past few years De Beers has been providing the market with more information about its affairs, sparking speculation it could be considering an initial public offering (IPO). Brokers draw a parallel with Swiss-based commodities trader Glencore, which increased transparency in the run-up to its share offer in May. But James Teager, a De Beers director who is close to the Oppenheimers, said the family was &quot;happy at the moment with its holding in the company&quot;. And when quizzed during a results briefing at the end of last year, Carroll denied she was seeking to change &quot;the status quo&quot; . Nevertheless, analysts in London and Johannesburg doubt the current ownership structure at De Beers will remain in place for long. Nicky Oppenheimer, the chairman, has been diversifying the family&apos;s investment portfolio, making it more international \u2013 a move viewed as a hedge against political risk in South Africa. Despite the ruling African National Congress&apos;s commitment to the open market and easy access for foreign investment, sections of the party want to reduce the influence of relatively prosperous whites, and raise the living standards of South Africa&apos;s black majority. A leading rebel is Julius Malema, the outspoken ANC youth leader, who was recently found guilty of &quot;hate speech&quot; for singing Shoot the Boer, a song that refers to white farmers. He has made repeated calls for the expropriation of white-owned land and the nationalisation of mines and banks. He is facing expulsion from the ANC for challenging president Jacob Zuma. Against this backdrop, De Beers shocked the industry a week ago by agreeing to shift the sales and sorting of uncut diamonds from London to Botswana, which will hit Britain&apos;s balance of payments. .", "publicationDate": "2011-09-24T23:04:11Z", "title": "Anglo American shareholders urge mining group to buy De Beers", "sentences": ["One shareholder said: &quot;Hardly anyone in the City knows how to value a diamond company, but if you ask the experts in Antwerp, Mumbai or Tel Aviv, they will tell you Anglo doesn&apos;t get full credit for its De Beers holding."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/25/anglo-american-de-beers"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "United Nations"], "article": "Cuts in Israel&apos;s defence budget and increases in taxes should pay for housing and education reforms aimed at meeting the demands of this summer&apos;s widespread &quot;social justice&quot; protests, a committee set up by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has recommended. The panel, headed by the economist Manuel Trajtenberg, was established in response to a wave of popular protests in Israel during the summer over the cost of housing, child care, food and fuel, which culminated in the country&apos;s biggest demonstrations demanding &quot;social justice&quot;. After 50 days of deliberations, it submitted its conclusions to the prime minister on his return from the United Nations. The Trajtenberg Committee recommended state investment in housing with controlled rents for low-paid families and fines imposed on the owners of empty homes. Next year&apos;s education budget should be increased to bring it in line with spending on defence. Free education from the age of three and a longer school day is recommended. Extra funding for housing and education should be found by a cut of about 5% in the defence budget and tax increases aimed at middle- and higher-income workers. At a press conference to set out his recommendations, Trajtenberg said the social justice protests were the result of &quot;a real, painful economic difficulty experienced by the backbone of Israeli society, working families, educated, with children, who are not making ends meet&quot;. Other factors were &quot;a deep sense of injustice&quot; over widening inequality and &quot;an estrangement of the ordinary citizen from state institutions, a sense that the powers that be do not listen to him, and that the political system had severed itself from him&quot;. He acknowledged defence cuts would not be easy &quot;especially considering the threats that still surround Israel. However, Israel&apos;s social security is as important as its physical security.&quot; Netanyahu, on receiving the report, said: &quot;The goal we have set for ourselves is to lower the cost of living. We realised that a reality in which the Israeli citizen pays too much for education and social services must change.&quot; But, he added, the government&apos;s top priority was &quot;the security of Israel&apos;s citizens&quot;. The social justice movement began with a few tents erected in Tel Aviv in protest over the cost of housing. Tent cities mushroomed across the country and demands broadened beyond housing to other economic and social issues. According to an opinion poll, 87% of the Israeli public supported the protests. Following a record turnout of about 430,000 at demonstrations across Israel on 3 September, the movement&apos;s organisers curtailed its activities in the run-up to the Palestinian statehood bid at the United Nations and a series of Jewish holidays beginning this week.

A bitter confrontation would have cost hundreds, if not thousands, of lives, significantly delaying the old president&apos;s fall. The chant that reverberated around Egypt&apos;s squares in the early post-Mubarak days, as euphoric Egyptians embraced soldiers, was &quot;The people and the army are one hand&quot;. This was not only the people&apos;s revolution, but the army&apos;s too. But it is now clear that the army does not perceive itself as a partner in the revolution, but as its representative and guardian: the sole bearer of its legitimacy. The honeymoon between military and protesters did not last long. Tahrir Square, once the scene of wild celebrations, turned into a battlefield as the army moved to disperse activists beating them with clubs and electric rods, and even firing live ammunition, leading to many casualties. Hundreds have been thrown in jail. Between 28 January and 29 August, almost 12,000 civilians were tried in military tribunals \u2013 far more than Mubarak managed in 30 years of dictatorship. Torture by police and military personnel remains widespread, with hundreds of reports of beatings, electrocution, and even sexual assault. Days after assuming power, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf) began to talk tough, declaring that it would not tolerate strikes, pickets &quot;or any action that disrupts the country&apos;s security&quot;, and imposing prison sentences on those who defied the ban. The army has since gone further, introducing a ban on public protest and curfews. This seems to have only strengthened activists&apos; resolve, as the frequent demonstrations held in Tahrir Square testify. Recently, exploiting the climate of tension heightened by the storming of the Israeli embassy, the army reactivated the state of emergency, announcing that it will remain in force until next June \u2013 dashing popular demands for a swift end to the draconian code that formed the constitutional underpinning for Mubarak&apos;s dictatorship, and served as his chief means of stifling dissent for three decades. In an indication of the widening rift between the judiciary and the army, Tareq al-Bishri, a respected judge who chaired the committee for the revision of the constitution, responded by declaring martial law invalid from 20 September 2011, as stipulated by article 59 of the constitutional referendum of 19 March 2011. If the state of emergency is one focal point of mounting political discontent, elections pledged for this month are another. The supreme council recently announced that elections would be held in November instead, with no guarantee that the new date would be adhered to. A complex set of electoral rules has not made things any better, with political parties demanding a vote exclusively based on the party proportional list system, and the army allowing individual candidacy as well \u2013 a move that critics say is designed to enable remnants of the ousted regime to sneak back to power. Such fears have been intensified by the enlarging of electoral districts, making it difficult for citizens to vote and candidates to organise election campaigns over vast areas such as &quot;North Cairo&quot;, which includes no fewer than 5 million citizens. The backdrop for all the army&apos;s decisions over the past eight months is its concern over its position in the emerging political system. The generals realise that there can be no return to 1952, when the &quot;Free Officers&quot; seized power and controlled the political arena for more than two decades. But they seem unwilling to retreat to their barracks without first securing the upper hand in internal and foreign policy matters. It is not the day-to-day running of the country that the army is interested in. Rather, it wants to have a tight grip on key issues: strategic decisions, budgetary distribution, and above all keeping the military itself free from public scrutiny. That is the reason why the army has moved to lay down its &quot;declaration of basic principles&quot;, which would grant it sweeping authority and enable it to intercede in civilian politics. In a telling statement, Major General Mamdouh Shaheen, a council member, declared: &quot;We want a model similar to that found in Turkey \u2026 Egypt, as a country, needs to protect democracy from the Islamists, because we know that these people do not think democratically&quot; \u2013 the same justification used by Arab dictators to legitimise despotism for decades. What this top officer means by the &quot;Turkish model&quot; is not its latest version, but the model that crippled political life for most of the past century. His statement may be greeted warmly in London, Washington, Paris or Tel Aviv, by those anxious to prevent any meaningful change from taking place. Whether in suits or uniforms, the interests of the region&apos;s autocrats seem destined to converge with those of the great western powers. And in this unholy marriage of internal and external obstructors of genuine reform lies the tragic plight of democracy and democrats in Arab lands.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T18:30:01Z", "title": "The Egyptian people's revolution is being hijacked by the army | Soumaya Ghannoushi", "sentences": ["His statement may be greeted warmly in London, Washington, Paris or Tel Aviv, by those anxious to prevent any meaningful change from taking place."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/sep/26/egyptian-revolution-army"}, {"tags": ["TV news", "Al-Jazeera", "Television industry", "Media", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The world&apos;s first Jewish 24-hour TV news channel has launched with the aim of offering not just &quot;news for Jews&quot; but attracting viewers interested in world events from a Jewish perspective as an alternative to leading networks such as the BBC, CNN, Sky News and al-Jazeera. &quot;Since the beginning of the world, everything with the word &apos;Jewish&apos; in it has been news,&quot; said Alexander Zanzer, Brussels bureau chief of Jewish News 1 (JN1). &quot;So we thought it was about time someone created a 24-hour rolling TV news channel that looks at global events through Jewish glasses.&quot; Broadcasting in Europe began via satellite last Wednesday. The channel will be rolled out across North America and the Middle East in cable and satellite packages over the coming weeks, and an internet live stream will be up and running within a month. &quot;We don&apos;t look at our channel as just being &apos;news for Jews&apos;,&quot; said JN1&apos;s editor-in-chief Peter Dickinson, based in Kiev. &quot;It&apos;s a much wider enterprise than that and I&apos;m confident we&apos;ll get a lot of non-Jewish viewers coming by for the variety of our voice. &quot;If you look at the news market over the last 20 years, the real development has been diversification. A lot of channels have gotten a lot of kudos by being different and we hope to do the same by offering our own unique perspective on global affairs&quot;. JN1 has already opened bureaux in Brussels, Tel Aviv and Kiev, and further studios are planned for Washington, Paris, London, Berlin and Moscow, with both Jewish and non-Jewish correspondents being signed up. The channel \u2013 a not-for-profit venture \u2013 currently broadcasts in English, but plans to expand and provide current affairs coverage in Russian, French, Spanish, Hebrew, Italian and German, said Zanzer. Its owners are Ukrainian oligarchs Igor Kolomoisky and Vadim Rabinovich, president and vice-president respectively of the European Jewish Union (EJU), a Brussels-based umbrella body of Jewish communities and organisations in Europe. Both are prominent philanthropists in the international Jewish community, financing civil society events in Israel and Ukraine. The pair have reportedly invested $5m in the channel because, said Zanzer, &quot;they now want to do something that resonates on an international level&quot;. The Palestinian statehood bid at the United Nations dominated the channel&apos;s output in the last week, but it also broadcast other Jewish-themed international news items, such as a call for fans of the football team AFC Ajax to bring Israeli flags to their next home match in protest against calls from antisemitism campaigners to ban the club&apos;s supporters from singing pro-Jewish chants. Eytan Gilboa, a communications professor at Israel&apos;s Bar-Ilan University, said that JN1 was part of a growing trend of independent global news channels set up by governments and non-state organisations dissatisfied with coverage offered by leading international TV news networks of their countries and interests. &quot;France has France 24, Russia has Russia Today, China has CCTV news,&quot; he said. &quot;Israel should have had a channel like this long ago, though I&apos;m glad JN1 is a private venture because government channels have no credibility.&quot; Coverage of Israel by existing news networks like BBC World and CNN International \u2013 as well as al-Jazeera \u2013 was biased against the Jewish state, said Gilboa. The point was echoed by Zanzer, who said JN1 would &quot;give more voice to Israel&quot;. &quot;Journalists want good guys and bad guys when they write a story, and when they write about Israel they&apos;ve already made up their minds,&quot; he added. But Zanzer was keen to point out that the channel was independent from the state of Israel and &quot;will not necessarily be pro- or anti-Israel; we&apos;ll let the public hear the Israeli perspective and it&apos;ll be up to the viewers to decide whether they&apos;re right&quot;. The channel&apos;s Israeli bureau chief, CNN and ABC News veteran Jordana Miller, was also adamant that JN1 will not become a &quot;propaganda station&quot;, saying &quot;there&apos;s nothing about this network that will exclude, diminish or cut off the Palestinian narrative when it comes to the conflict here&quot;. Gilboa claimed it was too soon to say whether channels such as JN1 could be successful but pointed out that success was relative and dependeent on the goals and expectations of the people backing them. &quot;None of these channels are profitable, they lose money,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like foreigners buying football teams in Britain \u2013 they don&apos;t buy them to make a profit.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T10:44:35Z", "title": "'JN1 won't become a propaganda station'", "sentences": ["JN1 has already opened bureaux in Brussels, Tel Aviv and Kiev, and further studios are planned for Washington, Paris, London, Berlin and Moscow, with both Jewish and non-Jewish correspondents being signed up."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/27/jn1-tv-news-channel"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "Israel", "Obama administration", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"], "article": "Newsweek is reporting that Israel has received 55 US-made GBU-28 bunker-busting bombs, citing it as evidence that the US-Israeli military relationship is deeper than ever, despite the bad chemistry between Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu. The other fruit of that relationship, the journalist Eli Lake reports, is an intriguing cooperative venture between Israel and some of its Arab neighbours to set up a radar array to give early warning of an impending Iranian missile attack. This is what Lake writes about the GBU-28 deal:  The bunker busters were a significant breakthrough. The Israelis first requested the sale in 2005, only to be rebuffed by the Bush administration. At the time, the Pentagon had frozen almost all U.S.-Israeli joint defense projects out of concern that Israel was transferring advanced military technology to China. In 2007, Bush informed then\u2013prime minister Ehud Olmert that he would order the bunker busters for delivery in 2009 or 2010. The Israelis wanted them in 2007. Obama finally released the weapons in 2009, according to officials familiar with the secret decision.  The GBU-28 question surfaced in a November 2009 US cable released by Wikileaks, in which the US embassy in Tel Aviv noted that &quot;the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the USG is helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran.&quot; It is certainly interesting that US-Israeli military ties were strengthened just as the two governments were falling out over settlements. Obama&apos;s initial strategy in the Middle East: to offer Israel a tough policy towards Iran in return for concessions over Middle East peace. The strategy failed when Netanyahu defied the US president over settlements, but the Israelis seem to have kept the bombs.  Asked about the bomb delivery by The Guardian, an Israeli official would say only: &quot;The strategic relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is deeper than meets the naked eye.&quot; Despite the American misgivings that the delivery might be perceived as a &apos;green light&apos; to attack Iran, it obviously did not lead to any such military action, despite speculation for the past several years that an attack was imminent. That may have been because Washington made it clear, even while delivering the bombs, that it was opposed to an attack; and because Israeli strategists themselves decided that air strikes against nuclear facilities would be too uncertain in their outcome, and would carry too high a price.  The impact of such weapons is all the more dubious now. The quarterly report on the Iranian programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier this month confirmed that Iran had started installing centrifuges for making 20% enriched uranium at Fordow, a heavily-militarised site dug under a mountain near Qom. The production of the 20% enriched uranium is officially to stock the Tehran Research Reactor for making medical isotopes, but the Institute for Science and International Security points out that Iran has already more fuel that it needs. New reactors would take at least 10 years to build, western experts believe, and Iran does not have the capacity to turn its 20% enriched uranium into reactor fuel.  On the other hand, the production of 20% enriched uranium represents major step towards the capacity to make highly-enriched uranium (HEU) usable in weapons. Some experts estimate that in terms of effort and level of difficulty, it is more than nine tenths the way along the road to weapons-grade capacity. Building up a stockpile of 20% uranium would therefore allow Iran to push towards nuclear weapons capacity in plain sight of the international community, dramatically shortening the time it would need to &quot;break out&quot; and build a bomb, if it chose to do so at a later date. And under the mountain at Fordow it could do so safe from the threat of Israel&apos;s GBU-28 bombs. Israeli officials once threatened that their government would strike militarily if Iran&apos;s nuclear programme threatened to reach &quot;a point of no return&quot;, a threshold beyond it would be impossible to stop Tehran of building weapons. That phrase is no longer used, largely because that threshold, as originally conceived, has already been passed. Iran already has enough low enriched uranium (LEU) for more than four bombs, if enriched further, and most observers believe it has the technical expertise to develop a warhead small enough to put on a missile. Israeli diplomats now talk about a range of possible &quot;red lines&quot;, such as the reconfiguring of Iranian centrifuges to make HEU, the installation of a large number of cascades of new-generation centrifuges or the advanced testing of non-nuclear, high-explosive components of a nuclear warhead.  In other words, the Israeli red lines have been moved back. They suggest that the Jewish state would only strike if Iran tried to break out of international nuclear safeguards to build a warhead. But that step may well never be taken. Most observers of the Iranian programme believe that it is aimed at building the capacity to break out quickly if the need arose, rather than actually building a bomb. That could be the uneasy limbo Israel has to learn to live with, no matter how many bunker-busters it has in its armoury.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T14:52:00Z", "title": "Obama administration 'supplied bunker-busting bombs to Israel'", "sentences": ["The GBU-28 question surfaced in a November 2009 US cable released by Wikileaks, in which the US embassy in Tel Aviv noted that &quot;the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the USG is helping Israel prepare for a strike against Iran.&quot; It is certainly interesting that US-Israeli military ties were strengthened just as the two governments were falling out over settlements."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2011/sep/27/iran-nuclear-weapons"}, {"tags": ["Thriller", "Drama", "Film", "Culture", "Helen Mirren", "Second world war", "The Mossad"], "article": "An English-language version of Ha-Hov, a 2007 Israeli thriller never released in this country, The Debt conflates two historical events: the hunt for Adolf Eichmann, the notorious implementer of the Final Solution, with the disappearance of Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor nicknamed the Angel of Death for his experiments on Auschwitz inmates.

The fact that the foreign minister is now directly referring to &quot;this illegitimate council&quot; (as he calls it) shows how seriously the Syrian regime is starting to take the opposition. While the regime&apos;s official narrative, ridiculous as it is, could at first afford to ignore the reality on the ground, this is no longer the case. On 2 October, the Syrian opposition managed to unify under a National Council that it said represented both the internal and the external opposition. Reactions have generally been quite positive among Syrians opposed to the regime, but any optimism was quickly dashed as both Russia and China vetoed a proposed (and heavily watered down) UN security council resolution condemning Syria for its oppression of protesters. In spite of this setback, the collapse of the Syrian regime is now quietly being referred to in terms of when, rather than if, it will happen. Turkey is said to be planning military exercises at its borders with Syria and planning to push ahead with its own sanctions and measures regardless of the security council. Meanwhile, Iran has quietly warned Turkey to stop meddling with Syria and, along with Iraq, reiterated its support for its president, Bashar al-Assad. This does not bode well, as a bloc of countries from Lebanon to Iran could do a lot to destabilise Turkey&apos;s border, the Middle East and even the world economy. Assad himself allegedly warned that if any Nato planes flew over Damascus, then Syria would rain fire on Tel Aviv. Domestically, it seems that prominent opposition figures are being targeted much more aggressively, with one prominent Kurdish human rights activist killed and another beaten up savagely last Friday. For the regime, it appears that this is a battle on many fronts. All this means that Assad will see the region burn before he gives up power, and he has allies who are prepared to do the same in order to ensure that he stays. The loss of Syria from Iran&apos;s sphere of influence would severely weaken her, and would be a major blow for Hezbollah, which relies on supplies coming in through Syria, rather than by sea. So Assad must stay at all costs, otherwise the whole necklace will come apart. Perhaps this is why the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, recently told Assad&apos;s regime to step aside if it was unable to implement reforms. The Russians may have given the west a slap on the wrist at the UN after what happened in Libya, but that doesn&apos;t mean they will support a faltering regime, especially one that could wreak so much havoc in such a critical part of the world. And this is why the gloves are finally off for Syria and her regional allies. This does not mean that the region is doomed to a war, but it seems that if there is even a hint of a Nato intervention against Syria, then somebody, somewhere, is likely to start pushing a lot of buttons, and many more people will die. Interestingly, Medvedev also hinted that Russia would not interfere if the Syrian people chose to remove Assad. He is right, as there is not a lot that he, or any of Assad&apos;s allies, can do if crowds waving Syrian flags start storming the president&apos;s residence. At the same time, there is nothing \u2013 apart from unilateral sanctions and condemnation \u2013 that anybody can do to help the protesters. But this is not a bad thing. The nascent Syrian opposition is trying to step up to its responsibilities and the internal dialogue still mostly favours a peaceful revolution \u2013 for the time being. This is a revolution that is by Syrians, for Syrians, and the Syrian people must now face their president and his regime alone.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T14:50:01Z", "title": "Syria's opposition must face the regime alone | Fadwa al-Hatem", "sentences": ["Assad himself allegedly warned that if any Nato planes flew over Damascus, then Syria would rain fire on Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/11/syria-opposition-assad-national-council"}, {"tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "Politics", "UK news", "Dubai", "Conservatives", "Lobbying"], "article": "The Shangri-La hotel, with its five-star facilities, rooftop swimming pool and \u00a3350-a-night rooms, is not the kind of place where anyone on a tight or even moderate budget would stay.

Certainly, hotel records at the Shangri-La in Dubai seen by the Guardian name the charity as the &quot;company&quot; under which he booked in, but hotel staff could not confirm if the charity had paid. Either way the record showed Werritty certainly spared no expense, selecting one of the more expensive suites in an already expensive hotel. He took a &quot;Horizon deluxe&quot; room on the 40th floor of the hotel in downtown Dubai, one level below the business lounge where Fox met defence industry businessman Harvey Boulter on 18 June in a meeting brokered by Werritty to discuss a possible defence contract and a legal battle involving the MoD. The room currently costs \u00a3320 per night, which means Werritty was spending the same for his room as the records showed Fox did in his rather more elevated capacity as defence secretary when he stayed in the hotel in April. The 41st floor Horizon business lounge is a good place to conduct business. Screened booths fitted with leather sofas are accessed via a manned reception desk and staff take their duty to keep the area exclusive seriously, repeatedly demanding your room number if you wander in for a look. It also emerged yesterday that a pro-Israeli lobbying organisation, Bicom, paid for Werritty&apos;s flight and hotel bill to attend a conference in Israel in 2009 where he was asked to join a panel and talk about Iran. The Herzliya conference was one of the events listed by the Ministry of Defence at which he met Fox. Amid questions as to whether Werritty has been earning money off the back of his access to and relationship with Fox, the defence secretary has said Werritty &quot;has a very wide range of long-standing business, international relations and political links of his own&quot;. Werritty&apos;s name appears at Companies House with two firms, Danscotia Consulting and Todhia Ltd, but it is unclear what either of them do. It is likely that the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, who interviewed Werritty on Tuesday, will have wanted to know what his business and political relations are. Werritty has so far not made any public statements. Pressed to say in the Commons on Monday if Werritty had received cash from clients due to his access to Fox, the defence secretary said: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; It seems Werritty also chose to eat in one of Dubai&apos;s more expensive restaurants. Boulter said he bumped into him in June, the night before he met Fox for the meeting in the Horizon business lounge that sparked the whole Werritty/ Fox scandal. Werritty was dining at Ruth&apos;s Chris American steakhouse. It is the kind of eaterie that attracts people who prize flavour over economy; fillet steaks sell for \u00a350 each and Maine Lobster goes for even more. To uncork the most expensive wine, a 1996 Chateau Cheval Blanc from Bordeaux, you need at least \u00a33,000, though there is no suggestion Werritty placed an order. Air fares Adam Werritty is known to have made 18 trips abroad over 14 months where Liam Fox was present but the question of how he paid for most of them remains a mystery. Travelling business class, those flights would have cost the 33-year-old more than \u00a338,000, according to Guardian estimates. Assuming Werritty paid for his own accommodation in five-star hotels the estimated 83 nights away could have cost up to another \u00a316,000. Even if he had just stayed one night at each destination, then the total cost of the trips would have reached \u00a340,132.

Egypt&apos;s interim military government claimed credit for brokering a deal between Israel and Hamas to win the release, after more than five years, of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, in exchange for several hundred Palestinian prisoners. And in Washington, an Iranian-American was indicted on charges of conspiring, with agents of Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards and a Drug Enforcement Agency informant posing as a Mexican drug lord, to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to Washington and launch attacks on the Saudi and Israeli embassies, with additional casualties to American civilians in the process. These developments \u2013 about which much remains to be clarified \u2013 demonstrate how much conventional wisdom is one of the first casualties of the Arab Spring. Israelis and Palestinians &quot;cannot negotiate&quot;? Egypt&apos;s transitional rulers are &quot;newly-hostile&quot; to Tel Aviv? Forces inside Iran have &quot;nothing to gain&quot; from provoking the US and Israel as well as Iran&apos;s regional rival Saudi Arabia simultaneously? All, apparently, wrong. At a moment where Egyptians are flexible enough to bring Hamas and Likud together, and Iranian Revolutionary Guards somehow conspire to transfer $100,000 to US banks supposedly immobilised by sanctions against Iran, the challenge events pose to Washington is a severe one: are we able to respond with flexibility and long-term strategic thinking ourselves? Or are we trapped in the same conventional wisdom our opponents are undermining? If Washington challenged its own conventional wisdom about threats and opportunities emanating from the Middle East, what would that look like? First, it would have \u2013 and promote \u2013 more confidence about its own staying power and resilience in the face of terror threats that, while not existential, are unfortunately still real. The FBI, DEA, Justice and State Departments cooperated to respond to the plot \u2013 and partnered with the government of Mexico to arrest the suspect. If the worst Iran&apos;s terror masterminds can do is lose agents in the Mexican borderlands negotiating with faux drug lords, Americans can rest easy. The United States has a crucial obligation to protect diplomatic missions on its territory \u2026 but no government would have ceased to function had the plot succeeded. Second, partnering with other governments \u2013 allies and otherwise \u2013 is going to be crucial going forward, and in fact, the US is off to a rather good start. Mexico stepped in to ensure that the suspect was arrested. Washington was in close touch with the Saudis regarding the plot. Secretary Clinton said that the alleged scheme &quot;creates a potential for international reaction that will further isolate Iran, that will raise questions about what they&apos;re up to, not only in the United States and Mexico&quot;. Egypt&apos;s government was eager to show its key regional role, just as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, all in different ways, have sought to showcase their regional leadership in recent weeks. Can Washington get beyond unilateral, unthinking responses to play successfully in such a new, complex environment? It&apos;s not clear. GOP presidential candidates Romney and Huntsman have both tried to give nuanced views of the Arab Spring in recent weeks \u2013 but can their nuance stand up to strident calls for punishing Egypt and bombing Iran? Finally, it is clear that extremist forces in the region \u2013 from Iran to Palestine to Egypt \u2013 are eager to incite US overreaction. Who loses most if the US bombs Iran or cuts off aid to Palestine or Egypt? Not extremists, unfortunately, but moderates who have argued for engagement with the US and the west. Washington&apos;s counter-terrorism policies have done a good job protecting it from attacks in the US coming to reality.

Living memory has witnessed two complete cycles from the Borodin Quartet and one from the Fitzwilliams, both of whom earned the trust of the composer himself. Add to that a recent cycle by the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv quartets and performances by the Emersons, the Brodskys, and by the Borodins again last year, and you have a\u00a0performance tradition that takes some\u00a0beating. Caution, though, is not a hallmark of the Pacifica Quartet, whose six-concert cycle got off to a fine start this Monday. The Illinois-based ensemble are best known for their revelatory performances of Elliott Carter&apos;s five quartets (also recorded for Naxos). Judging by the first concert, the vibrancy of attack and clarity of gesture that distinguish their Carter attunes well to Shostakovich. The players go for body over beauty (the violist, unusually, uses a black-haired bow, which produces a coarser but bigger sound), but they make a lovely noise when asked. The cycle is in chronological order, so the marked improvement as they progress through the first three quartets promises much for the remaining 12. Many stumble over the First Quartet, seeking to undercut its deceptive simplicity by bringing out the sinister shadows everyone assumes should be there. But this is a flawed plan: you can&apos;t shine light on shadows. The Second and Third quartets, however, wear their troubled hearts more proudly on their sleeves. The Pacifica were in their element exploring the quasi-operatic gestures of the former, while the ironic caricatures of the latter found in the ensemble a heightened degree of concentration and control. I&apos;ll admit that this work often irritates me, but here I found it deeply moving \u2013 as apparently did many others in the disappointingly half-full hall.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T18:42:41Z", "title": "Pacifica Quartet \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Add to that a recent cycle by the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv quartets and performances by the Emersons, the Brodskys, and by the Borodins again last year, and you have a\u00a0performance tradition that takes some\u00a0beating."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/12/pacifica-quartet-review"}, {"tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Photography", "Culture"], "article": "Elad Lassry&apos;s mouth-watering photos have the artificial colours, hard gloss and unreal flavour of boiled sweets. His portraits and still-lifes include lipsticks, coffee-grinders, buff blondes and household ornaments as well as ballet dancers and an ark&apos;s worth of animals \u2013 from giraffes to pedigree cats. They bring to mind bygone eras of genre photography, from the over-tinted food pictured in 1970s recipe books to stagey old publicity shots of pop groups and actors. That he&apos;s shown his own photos alongside vintage Hollywood stills (a fresh-faced pre-Psycho Antony Perkins is a recurring figure in his exhibitions) and pages from old magazines adds to the nostalgic hit. Yet Lassry wants us to see his peacock&apos;s parade of pop culture with fresh eyes, not as tired kitsch but something new. To this end, he strips his subjects from their ordinary surroundings and shoots them against infinity backgrounds in luscious, garish hues like apple green or cherry red. Set in colour-co-ordinated frames, the pictures become weird worlds where form takes over. In Cat and Duck (Red), for instance, two tacky glass animal ornaments are all liquid lines against a scarlet backdrop. No longer mantelpiece fare, they&apos;ve been photographed one in front of the other to become a hybrid silhouette \u2013 a winged creature with a beak and pointy ears. Lassry also likes to use double exposure here and there, giving people or animals a worrying two sets of eyes.     More than meets the eye ... Detail from Man 071 (2007). Photograph: Elad Lassry/David Kordansky Gallery    Born in Tel Aviv in 1977, Lassry has been based in LA since he was 20. He originally studied film there before turning to art, and his work is shiny with Hollywood-standard production values. In recent years he&apos;s picked up a string of accolades: he was one of four artists selected for MoMA&apos;s New Photography exhibition in 2010, and this year he was nominated for Britain&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse prize. Lassry might be thought of alongside other art photographers such as Annette Kelm, or his fellow Deutsche B\u00f6rse nominee Roe Etheridge, who tap the commercial conventions of magazine and product shots to turn cliched subjects on their head. You have to hand it to someone who can transform eyeshadow compacts into hard-edged abstractions, and make puppies and kittens into creepy little beasts. Why we like him: Lassry also makes 35mm films. His Untitled (Ghost), shown at this year&apos;s Venice Biennale, is one of many featuring ballet. Its dancers in sea-blue and yellow catsuits are a spectral troupe, superimposed over one another and see-through like phantoms. The film looks back to the days of spirit photography, and like his photographs, strives to capture more than ordinarily meets the eye. Cast away: Though Lassry has said he&apos;s not interested in celebrity, you can spot a couple of well-known actors in his films. Rhada Mitchell appeared in his work Zebra and Woman, while Eric Stolz played choreographer Jerome Robbins in an untitled 16mm work from 2009. Where can I see him?

It&apos;s been open, albeit on a less-than-100% service, for more than two months and it has been packed every day. This may be partly due to the fact that there&apos;s no charge until the transport authorities sort out problems with ticketing machines and smart traffic lights; but while it&apos;s free, it&apos;s full. I started at the northern-most tip of the route, in the Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze&apos;ev, just across the Green Line, travelled through the Palestinian neighbourhoods of Beit Hanina and Shuafat, past the walls of the Old City, along Jerusalem&apos;s central artery of Jaffa Street and over the stunningly beautiful Bridge of Strings. Then I got out and walked part of the way back (the service is still a little slow) before boarding a return train to Pisgat Ze&apos;ev. Each carriage is a microcosm of Jerusalem&apos;s population, rarely seen in such intimate proximity to each other. Among the characters in this complex tableau were:  A religiously-observant Jewish mother, a colourful scarf wound round her head to cover her hair, long skirt and long sleeves concealing almost all flesh from sight, four young children clinging to her, each other or the handles of a baby-buggy containing a fifth infant.  A beautiful girl soldier, long glossy curls bouncing down her khaki-clad back, i-pod plugged into her ears, bulging grip bag beside her army-issue boots.  An ultra-orthodox man in standard monochrome, curled sidelocks beneath his black hat, thick coat in the October warmth, eyes strictly averted from all around him.  A young Palestinian woman, kohl-rimmed eyes matched by black nail varnish, wearing hijab, tight jeans and a turquoise top clinging to her pregnant belly. She was with her mother (I assume); visibly tired yet quietly elegant, arched eyebrows, restrained make-up, conservatively-dressed compared to her daughter.  A dour security guard in an ill-fitting blue uniform, cropped bleached hair, aviator sunglasses, patrolling up and down the carriage, probably a Russian immigrant.  An Israeli guy in baggy shorts and t-shirt, longish hair and beads, more laid-back Tel Aviv than tight, tense Jerusalem.  A gaggle of Palestinian boys, not quite lads, around 12 to 14, close-cropped hair and football shirts, switching effortlessly between Arabic (with each other) and Hebrew (with the security guards).  A tired middle-aged Jewish woman clutching plastic bags of cheap vegetables and bread from the shuk.  An Asian mother-and-daughter, probably Filipino, perhaps part of the army of imported carers for ageing Israelis.  A neat 60-ish man with a trimmed moustache and metal-rimmed glasses, belted brown trousers and slightly worn jacket, reading an Arabic newspaper. On the way back, I was puzzled when not all the Palestinians got off the train at Shuafat and Beit Hanina, and some even got on. But the only stops ahead in this direction were in the Jewish settlement, Pisgat Ze&apos;ev. Why, I wondered, were they heading there? Then the train stopped in front of a huge mall, Israeli and global brands lit up in neon on its facade.  Someone \u2013 another foreign journalist \u2013 told me soon after I arrived here that the city&apos;s shopping malls and hospitals were among the few places were you could see a cross-section of the population in one place. Shopping is the new co-existence, she said wryly. And now, perhaps, so is travelling on the light railway.\u2022Comments on this article are set to remain open for 12 hours after publication although they may close overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T07:28:07Z", "title": "Light railway draws Jerusalem's disparate population", "sentences": ["An Israeli guy in baggy shorts and t-shirt, longish hair and beads, more laid-back Tel Aviv than tight, tense Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Hamas", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Fresh lilies are regularly laid at a monument by the Tel Aviv Dolphinarium bearing witness to an evening in 2001 when 21 Israeli teenagers were killed while queuing outside a nightclub. Another 132 were injured in the attack by Saeed Hotari, a young Palestinian suicide bomber affiliated with Hamas. But last week flowers arrived more in protest than in sorrow. Husam Badran, the former head of Hamas&apos;s military wing in the West Bank and instigator of the Dolphinarium attack, is expected to be among 477 Palestinian prisoners released on Tuesday in a deal to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. A further 550 will be freed within two months. &quot;It&apos;s surreal. It&apos;s beyond belief,&quot; said one young mother angrily as she looked at the monument. &quot;I may be the only one against it, but no good deal sees the release of 1,000 killers. People say Netanyahu showed courage in agreeing to set them free, but I say he has given in to terrorism.&quot; Over the past five years, the parents of captive soldier Gilad Shalit have won the Israeli public with their tireless campaign to free their son, demanding the Israeli government do whatever it takes to rescue him from his captors in the Gaza Strip. Israel celebrated last week when they finally succeeded. But the nation&apos;s joy is tempered with grave misgivings. To Palestinians, the 1,027 prisoners exchanged for Shalit are freedom fighters. To Israelis, they are terrorists responsible for some of the country&apos;s bloodiest atrocities. Israel wants Shalit free but is struggling to stomach the cost of his freedom. Gustav Specht, 47, who runs a restaurant close to the Dolphinarium on Tel Aviv Beach, shares the broad public reaction as described in the Israeli media: &quot;I think it&apos;s the least bad result. Everyone I know is happy Gilad will be free.&quot; But his colleague Alon Reuvney, 28, thinks differently. His friend lost his father in a suicide attack in Jerusalem several years ago: &quot;He heard about the release of his father&apos;s killer on the news. No one thought to tell his family. He is very angry.&quot; The official list of prisoners agreed for release has not been published, but several leaked versions have appeared on Arabic news websites. Israelis recognised some of the region&apos;s most notorious terrorists. There was Muhammad Duglas, implicated in a suicide bombing at the Sbarro pizza restaurant in Jerusalem in which 15 people were killed. Abdel Hadi Ghanem of Islamic Jihad, responsible for the 1989 attack on a public bus in which 16 Israelis died. And hundreds more like them. Others were convicted of lesser offences. Few doubt that securing Shalit&apos;s return has boosted prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s popularity but Jerusalem Post columnist Jonathan Spyer warns he has taken a gamble for public affection. &quot;Within six months time, we will see terrorist attacks linked to these men who are being released. And at that point Bibi [Netanyahu] will pay a very serious price,&quot; Spyer said. &quot;In all of this, the Shalit family and Hamas are the winners; the Israeli public will be the loser.&quot; Israeli terror expert Boaz Ganor agrees the release of these political prisoners has provided Hamas with legitimacy but predicts they will not pose an immediate threat to Israeli security. Hamas, listed by the US and the UK as a terror organisation, has proved itself a pragmatic negotiating partner. By insisting on the release of prisoners from all factions, it has regained popular support across Gaza and the West Bank, undermining the Palestinian Authority midway through its UN bid for statehood. It would not serve Hamas&apos;s interests, Ganor says, to let the situation deteriorate by allowing released prisoners to wage a campaign of terror. &quot;But I&apos;m not ruling out further kidnappings. This has proved so strategically effective in the past, I believe they [Hamas] would try to kidnap more Israeli soldiers and civilians to gather more power in their hands.&quot; Boaz also said it was the prisoner swap negotiated in 1985 by Shimon Peres \u2014 1,150 Palestinian prisoners for three Israeli soldiers captured in the Lebanon war \u2014 that ignited the first intifada. Despite a history of militants freed in swaps killing again, Israel has always negotiated to free its soldiers. Nimrod Kahn, 33, who runs a cookery school in Tel Aviv, says, however unpalatable the deal, Israelis expect their state to make this compromise. It is a guarantee for every high-school graduate expected to devote three years to military service. &quot;I don&apos;t object to the releasing of these prisoners in principle; they would be released in a peace deal sooner or later. I object to this deal because it opens the gate for blackmail,&quot; Kahn said. &quot;But it&apos;s expected our state will take responsibility for its soldiers. In Israel, the soldier is the holy cow \u2013 it cannot be slaughtered under any circumstances.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-10-15T23:08:52Z", "title": "Israel divided over price of freedom for captive soldier Gilad Shalit", "sentences": ["Fresh lilies are regularly laid at a monument by the Tel Aviv Dolphinarium bearing witness to an evening in 2001 when 21 Israeli teenagers were killed while queuing outside a nightclub.", "Gustav Specht, 47, who runs a restaurant close to the Dolphinarium on Tel Aviv Beach, shares the broad public reaction as described in the Israeli media: &quot;I think it&apos;s the least bad result.", "Nimrod Kahn, 33, who runs a cookery school in Tel Aviv, says, however unpalatable the deal, Israelis expect their state to make this compromise."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/israel-hamas"}, {"tags": ["Gilad Shalit", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "     Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has told the families of Israelis killed by some of the 1,027 Palestinian prisoners due to be swapped for the captured soldier Gilad Shalit that he &quot;shares their pain in seeing their loved ones&apos; murderers freed&quot; but had little choice. Netanyahu justified the deal with Hamas in a letter delivered shortly before the relatives of victims of suicide bombings and other attacks asked the high court in Jerusalem to block the exchange. Shalit, 25, has been held incommunicado in Gaza for more than five years. Netanyahu said he knew &quot;the price was very heavy&quot; for relatives of the victims. He added that the decision was among the most difficult he had ever made, because he lost a brother in the conflict with the Palestinians. But he said he &quot;was faced with the responsibility of the prime minister of Israel to bring home every soldier who is sent to protect our citizens&quot;. Critics say the agreement with Hamas is not only a concession to terrorists but will encourage the Palestinians to abduct more soldiers. Some say it is little different from a deal opposed by Netanyahu two years ago before he became prime minister. Palestinians being freed include the founders of Hamas&apos;s armed wing and the organisers of suicide bombings and other attacks in which scores of Israeli civilians, including children and teenagers, were killed. They include the bombings of a Jerusalem pizza restaurant frequented by families, a Tel Aviv nightclub popular with young Russian immigrants and a Netanya hotel. There were angry scenes inside and outside the high court where the proceedings were repeatedly interrupted by family members yelling objections to the deal with Hamas. Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost his parents and three siblings in a suicide bomb at a Jerusalem pizza restaurant 10 years ago, shouted at Shalit&apos;s father, Noam, telling him to hang a black flag on his home because &quot;this is a day of mourning&quot;. Schijveschuurder was arrested last week after vandalising the memorial to the assassinated Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who reached the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians. He painted &quot;release Yigal Amir&quot; \u2013 the name of the Jewish extremist who murdered Rabin \u2013 on the memorial. Yossi Zur asked the high court to block the release of the Palestinians who killed his son and 16 other people in a suicide attack on a bus in Haifa in 2003 because it would only encourage further attacks.. &quot;From our experience with past deals, and sadly we have a lot of experience, we know how many Israelis will be killed as a result of the release of these terrorists. I am here to protect my children who are still alive,&quot; he told Israeli television. Shalit&apos;s father said they sympathised with the victims&apos; pain, but asked the court not to interfere in the agreement. &quot;Not implementing the deal will not return the murdered loved ones while, on the other hand, it would sentence Gilad to death.&quot; The president of the high court, Dorit Beinisch, said she recognised the government&apos;s agreement with Hamas meant the negation of legal decisions to jail the Palestinian prisoners. &quot;The moral and legal difficulty is laid out before us \u2026 we are sitting among our own people. There is no need to explain the painful history and the very difficult dilemmas we face.&quot; The government told the court that the exchange is a political matter which it is authorised to carry out, as recognised by the failure of legal challenges in similar cases before. &quot;The court has refused, time after time, to interfere with the release of prisoners as part of a deal reached through political negotiations,&quot; the government told the court. A ruling was expected on Monday evening. If the court does not block it, the handover will take place in stages. Israel will first release 27 Palestinian women prisoners. Shalit, a corporal who was promoted to sergeant major while in captivity, will then be moved from Gaza in to southern Israel, possibly directly through one of the crossings between the two territories or briefly via Egypt. Israel will then release 450 male prisoners to Gaza and the West Bank, aside from a small number destined for exile in Turkey and other countries in the region. The remainder of the 1,027 Palestinians are to be freed in the coming weeks. Netanyahu, his defence minister, Ehud Barak, and senior military officers will greet Shalit at an air force base in the south of the country. He will undergo a medical examination and then be flown to his parents&apos; home in Mitzpe Hila, near Israel&apos;s border with Lebanon. Shalit was captured by Palestinians who tunnelled from Gaza into Israel and killed two other members of his tank crew before snatching him. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2011.

This is a robbery!&quot; In Santiago, 25,000 Chileans processed through the city, pausing outside the presidential palace to hurl insults at the country&apos;s billionaire president. In Frankfurt, more than 5,000 people massed outside the European Central Bank, in scenes echoed in 50 towns and cities across Germany, from Berlin to Stuttgart. Sixty thousand people gathered in Barcelona, 100 in Manila, 3,000 in Auckland, 200 in Kuala Lumpur, 1,000 in Tel Aviv, 4,000 in London. A month to the day after 1,000 people first turned up in Wall Street to express their outrage at corporate greed and social inequality, campaigners are reflecting on a weekend that saw a relatively modest demonstration in New York swell into a truly global howl of protest. The Occupy campaign may have hoped, at its launch, to inspire similar action elsewhere, but few can have foreseen that within four weeks, more than 900 cities around the world would host co-ordinated protests directly or loosely affiliated to the Occupy cause. The exact targets of protesters&apos; anger may differ from city to city and country to country. But while their numbers remain small in many places, activists argue that Saturday&apos;s demonstrations, many of which are still ongoing \u2013 and are pledged to remain so for the foreseeable future \u2013 are evidence of a growing wave of global anger at social and economic injustice. &quot;This is not a battle by youth or Chilean society,&quot; said Camila Vallejo, a Chilean student leader who has become a key figure in that country&apos;s protests, and who this week travelled to Europe to forge alliances with protest movements there. &quot;This is a world battle that transcends all frontiers.&quot; The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said the global financial crisis was the trigger, adding: &quot;What you are seeing all around the world, starting from Wall Street, people are showing their frustrations.&quot; After a month of no more than expressions of lukewarm empathy for the movement&apos;s anti-Wall Street feeling, Barack Obama&apos;s spokesman adopted the protesters&apos; own terminology in calling themselves &quot;the 99%&quot;. &quot;The president will continue to acknowledge the frustration that he himself shares about the need for Washington to do more to support our economic recovery and to ensure that the interest of the 99% of Americans is well-represented,&quot; said Josh Earnest. The protests may have coalesced around the Occupy movement&apos;s suggested date of 15 October, but the wave of public anger did not, of course, begin in New York. Occupy Wall Street has acknowledged its debt to the Arab spring, and was inspired and partly organised in its earliest stages by the Canadian-based Adbusters campaign group. The Chilean and Israeli protests also predate the US campaign. Spain&apos;s &quot;indignados&quot;, or outraged, claim some credit for inspiring the protest, having begun camping out in Madrid&apos;s Puerta del Sol square in May, sparking similar long-term demonstrations around the country. With at least 200,000 people coming out on to the streets on Saturday, the Spanish movement proved that it was still alive after a summer break in which many thought it had gone quiet. Protesters continue to occupy the &quot;Hotel Madrid&quot;, which they broke into on Saturday, and a building in Barcelona. The Spanish movement is focused on the 20 November general election when, with no little irony, opinion polls suggest the leftwing protest movement may help to eject the socialist party of the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, in favour of a government led by the rightwing People&apos;s Party. Mariano Rajoy, the party&apos;s leader, seems set for a landslide victory and is expected to impose a heavy dose of economic liberalism and austerity on the country. Each movement has its own local flavour. The Israelis complained about housing, high cost of living and &quot;social justice&quot;. For Chile, education was the catalyst. In Greece, it was a backlash against austerity. For Filipinos, US imperialism was apparently the target. But there were unifying themes, too: tents, social media, the &quot;human microphone&quot; \u2013 where the crowds chant back phrases uttered by a speaker, and shaky &quot;jazz hands&quot; to indicate agreement. In parts of the world where protest movements are longer established, agendas are widening. Chilean protesters have moved on from education to target banks over interest rates, and to protest against GM crops and a proposed dam in remote Patagonia. A general strike has been called for this Wednesday and Thursday. The Israeli protests have incorporated demands ranging from lower food prices and affordable child care, to higher welfare benefits and curbs on the concentration of economic wealth and power in the hands of a few corporations. Exasperation with the state of capitalism and corporate greed was manifest at the weekend in cities around the world. &quot;The protest is continuing, though it is changing in its methods and targets,&quot; said Israeli activist Yuli Khromchenco. &quot;We are moving to other spheres. Part of this is about our internal organisation, creating small teams and small events around particular issues such as education \u2026 we need to build structure, develop methods of direct action \u2013 and for people to gather their strength.&quot; A comparatively modest march in Tel Aviv on Saturday followed much larger protests across Israel during the summer demanding economic reform. A tent city in the prosperous Rothschild Boulevard, in Tel Aviv, was cleared by the municipal authorities and police earlier this month with little resistance. Other tent-dwellers have also packed up or been cleared, bar a few isolated stragglers. At its peak, the Israeli movement saw scores of tent cities across the country and galvanised hundreds of thousands of Israelis to take part in marches and rallies that had enormous public support \u2013 87%, according to one poll. There are even some signs of cross-fertilisation. Vallejo, perhaps the most charismatic leader of a still largely leaderless movement in Chile, popped up at the march in Paris this weekend. Italian media suggested that many of the rioters in a protest in Rome at the weekend had trained together in the woods of the Val di Susa area, in north-west Italy, where protesters have been trying to block the construction of a new high speed rail line. The Italian daily La Repubblica quoted one unnamed rioter on Monday saying that he and others had regularly travelled to Greece to get tips from protesters there. Given its particularly parlous economic situation, Greece has seen the most focused public anger so far, in protests that dwarf the modest several hundred who turned out in Athens on Saturday. A barrage of strikes, work stoppages and sit-ins will peak with a paralysing two-day general walk-out on Wednesday. The parliament will vote on Thursday on further austerity measures. &quot;The biggest protests ever seen in this country will take place in the coming days,&quot; Ilias Iliopoulos, general secretary of Greece&apos;s million-strong civil-servants&apos; union, Adedy, told the Guardian. &quot;The whole of Athens will fill with demonstrators \u2026 the government&apos;s heartless economic policies have to be overturned.&quot; In Berlin, police pulled down tents pitched in front of the historic Reichstag parliament building on Saturday evening and confiscated sleeping bags, mats and plates, as a permanent no-protest zone around the Reichstag outlaws all organised gatherings. On Monday afternoon about 40 protesters remained at Platz der Republik, the grassy square in front of the Reichstag. Watched by a small group of police officers, the assembled discussed the future of their protest, using the &quot;human microphone&quot; technique to amplify a speaker&apos;s voice for those at the back. Organic clementines were passed around as one young man, smoking a pungent pipe, said they were determined to set up camp there and not elsewhere in the city. He said OccupyBerlin was still in the &quot;development stage&quot; and they were trying to reach a consensus about how best to proceed. &quot;It&apos;s symbolic,&quot; he said, pointing to the famous inscription above the Reichstag&apos;s grand entrance dedicating it to &quot;Dem Deutschen Volke&quot;, the German people. &quot;We are supposed to play a part in democracy,&quot; he said.

But he got one decision just right - his resignation last Friday. The report by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, which can be found on the Cabinet Office website, leaves many questions unanswered and is frustratingly short of detail. But if David Cameron was presented with this and Fox was still in post, he would have to sack him. O&apos;Donnell makes clear that Fox gave access to Adam Werritty that he was not entitled to, held meetings with him without proper civil service supervision, and was warned about his conduct, yet continued to see his best friend regardless. Because Fox also introduced Werritty to a donor, the money given to his friend could give rise &quot;to the perception of a conflict of interest&quot; - yet another breach of the ministerial code. As O&apos;Donnell concludes in paragraph 21 and 22, Fox knew that he&apos;d made grave mistakes, and the implication is that he was right to resign.  Dr Fox has already accepted that his actions and judgement fell short of the standards of conduct required in the Ministerial Code and the evidence in this report supports the conclusion of a clear breach of the Ministerial Code. He should have declared to his Permanent Secretary that Mr Werritty was a friend who had a company, Pargav, which was funded by a number of donors, some of whom had provided funding to Dr Fox when in Opposition...   This was a failure of judgement on his part for which he has taken the ultimate responsibility in resigning office. Your foreword to the Ministerial Code makes clear that you expect Ministers to act in the national interest, above improper influence, and to serve to the highest standards of conduct. The Ministerial Code sets out very clearly the standards of behaviour required from Ministers.Dr Fox did not live up to these standards which he has since acknowledged.  O&apos;Donnell also makes clear that Fox was warned by both the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, Ursula Brennan, and his private office, about the risks posed by his friendship with Werritty. And he did very little about it. Worse than that, O&apos;Donnell reports that for two sensitive meetings where civil servants should have been present - one in Dubai and one in Tel Aviv - Fox turned down advice to have someone from the MoD in the room. He says...  &quot;Private office attendance was offered for both the visits set out above and declined by Dr Fox.&quot;  The wonder is that Fox thought, until the end of last week, that he could tough this one out. By his own admission he had broken the ministerial code, and O&apos;Donnell&apos;s report was never going to disabuse him of this. In fact, O&apos;Donnell, cheekily perhaps, borrowed the phrase used by Fox in his apology last week, about him &quot;blurring of lines&quot; between his work and his friendship. O&apos;Donnell couldn&apos;t find any evidence that his behaviour had breached national security, or that he had benefited financially from his friendship with Werritty. Fox will cling on to that...but is hardly consolation. The report is an embarrassment for him, and those of his supporters who thought he deserved a second chance.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-18T17:46:18Z", "title": "Fox report shows he got one thing spot on - he quit", "sentences": ["Worse than that, O&apos;Donnell reports that for two sensitive meetings where civil servants should have been present - one in Dubai and one in Tel Aviv - Fox turned down advice to have someone from the MoD in the room."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2011/oct/18/liam-fox-and-adam-werritty-and-report"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gilad Shalit", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Fatah", "Mahmoud Abbas"], "article": "     He came home to flowers, flags and a euphoria tinged with shock at his fragility; free at last but inevitably scarred by his 1,940 days of captivity. The boy soldier, whose abduction by Hamas militants in June 2006 had turned him into a symbol of national unity, was at the end of his ordeal, but only the beginning of a long period of difficult readjustment and rehabilitation. The Black Hawk helicopter that brought Sergeant First Class Gilad Shalit to the tiny hilltop community of Mizpe Hila close to the Lebanese border touched down just after 4.30pm, silhouetted against a pink and gold streaked sky. Hundreds of neighbours and supporters lined the streets as a long convoy of vehicles carried him the last few miles to the family home, throwing white roses and carnations in its path and waving Israeli flags and champagne bottles in the air. The relief and joy, evident at the end of a long day which began with Shalit being handed over to Egyptian mediators by militants wearing black face masks and Hamas green headbands, was mirrored in Gaza and the West Bank by relatives and supporters of the 1,027 Palestinian prisoners whose release was the price of the young soldier&apos;s freedom. The agreement, brokered after years of delicate negotiations by international mediators, was hailed by many Israelis and is expected to boost political support for prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. But debate about the political and security costs of the deal is likely to grow as the euphoria dies down. In Mizpe Hila, where Shalit grew up in a close community of fewer than 600 residents, the first pictures of the freed captive were greeted with whoops and cheers. He was alive, he was walking unaided, and he was smiling. But anxiety set in as footage of an interview on Egyptian television was aired on giant screens. &quot;I cried,&quot; said Tzippy Newman, who had travelled from her home in the West Bank settlement of Ginot Shomron. &quot;He looked like a concentration camp victim. Emaciated, weak. He has been through a terrible ordeal, and it was visible.&quot; Shalit \u2013 rake thin, deathly pale, with sunken eyes, laboured breathing and a dazed expression \u2013 spoke of missing his family and friends, and his fears that he would remain in captivity for many more years. &quot;Of course I missed my family. I missed friends, meeting people to talk to people, and not to sit all day, to do the same things,&quot; he told his Egyptian interviewer. An Israeli official, speaking anonymously but claiming to voice the views of many of his colleagues, said he was shocked the interview had been &quot;forced on&quot; Shalit within minutes of his release. The 25-year-old was then taken across the border into Israel for an initial medical examination and telephone conversation with his parents, Noam and Aviva, whose tireless campaign for his release he had been aware of during his captivity. Medics said he was suffering from malnutrition. His journey home continued via helicopter to the Tel Nof military base in central Israel for an emotional reunion with his family, preceded by a formal welcome by Netanyahu. &quot;Hello, Gilad. Welcome back to Israel. It&apos;s so good to have you home,&quot; the prime minister said as he hugged the young man. The country was &quot;united in joy and pain&quot; but the price had been heavy, Netanyahu said at a press conference. &quot;I know very well that the pain of the families of the victims of terrorism is too heavy to bear \u2026 but I also knew that in the current diplomatic circumstances, this was the best agreement we could achieve.&quot; In Mizpe Hila \u2013 whose name means &quot;aura&quot; in Hebrew \u2013 the mood swung between euphoria and anxiety as the wait for the local boy lengthened with the afternoon shadows. Rumours began to circulate that Shalit had fainted during or following his first helicopter journey; it seemed all too possible for a young man whose long incarceration without natural light was swiftly followed by a flight through the open skies. There was hushed talk that he was too physically and psychologically frail to undertake the final leg of the journey by helicopter and might even have to be hospitalised. But then word came that doctors had given permission for a second flight, and anticipation began to mount. &quot;It&apos;s a very, very exciting moment,&quot; said Ella Hefez, a volunteer with the campaign to secure his release for the past three years. &quot;We did so many things to bring him home, but in the last few months I lost hope. I want to thank the prime minister for this big, big decision. It wasn&apos;t easy.&quot; Despite being &quot;from the left&quot;, she said she would vote for Netanyahu at the next election as a way of showing her appreciation. But Varda Goldblat, a social worker from Tel Aviv and active in the campaign for the past four years, said she was cynical about Netanyahu&apos;s motives. &quot;He is late by five years,&quot; she said, adding that the prime minister had only acted following the popular social justice protests that swept Israel this summer. &quot;Netanyahu is only concerned about his position, and the young people shook his position in the summer. So he makes a miracle. He has to give something to distract the minds of the people.&quot; The price had been high, &quot;but the price of not setting him free would have been much worse for Israeli society \u2013 the loss of belief in the army, the damage to our values \u2026 the ethos of never leaving a soldier in the field.&quot; Despite his visible fragility, Shalit would recover from his ordeal with the help and support of the community, many in the village said. &quot;It&apos;s like a bubble here,&quot; said Asaf Sabo, 25, who had been to school with Shalit. &quot;We are not exposed to many of the things that you see in the city.&quot; Sabo and another of the soldier&apos;s friends, Tomer Yona, 25, said there would be no big welcome-home party. &quot;Not now, not in the first days or weeks. It depends on his psychological state,&quot; said Yona. The pair had also been in the army as part of their compulsory military service at the time of Shalit&apos;s abduction. &quot;It wasn&apos;t easy,&quot; said Sabo. &quot;You couldn&apos;t speak about it.&quot; For at least one of those among the crowds overlooking the rolling hills of the western Galilee, it was an extraordinarily poignant day. Miki Goldwasser, 65, joined forces with the Shalit family after her son, Ehud, was abducted along with fellow soldier Eldad Regev by Hezbollah militants close to the Lebanon border in July 2006, a month after Shalit was snatched at the other end of the country. Two years later the remains of Goldwasser and Regev were returned to their families by Hezbollah in exchange for five Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. The pair had been killed during the operation. But, she said, &quot;I put my sadness aside. I want only to share the moment of seeing Gilad alive.&quot; The young soldier&apos;s release was &quot;a great moment&quot;. She had come to share the Shalit family&apos;s joy. Aviva Shalit, she said, &quot;gave birth to Gilad once, but today she&apos;s giving birth to him for the second time. This time the labour took five years.&quot; As the convoy carrying the family was whisked through a a heavy police guard leading to his home, Shalit waved briefly to the crowd. Shortly afterwards, his father Noam stepped outside the house to thank the Israeli public for their support and request privacy. His son, he said, was overwhelmed by the attention after such a long period of isolation but was generally in reasonable health. &quot;Our son has been reborn,&quot; he said, before disappearing inside to savour his newly reunited family.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-18T19:26:09Z", "title": "Middle East witnesses day of euphoria and tears both sides of the divide", "sentences": ["But Varda Goldblat, a social worker from Tel Aviv and active in the campaign for the past four years, said she was cynical about Netanyahu&apos;s motives."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/18/middle-east-euphoria-tears-divide"}, {"tags": ["Liam Fox", "Politics", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Ministry of Defence", "David Cameron", "House of Commons", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "The scale of Liam Fox&apos;s defiance of Whitehall rules was laid bare this evening when it emerged the former defence secretary blocked civil servants attending key meetings alongside Adam Werritty, failed to tell his permanent secretary that he had solicited funds to bankroll his close friend, and ignored private office requests to distance himself from the relationship.

Dr Fox took action in respect of business cards but clearly made a judgment that his contact with Mr Werritty should continue.&quot; One of Werritty&apos;s 22 visits to the MoD was dedicated to a discussion with Fox&apos;s special advisers on his improper use of business cards. Fox also failed to inform Brennan of his financial links with Werritty. O&apos;Donnell stated: &quot;He should have declared to his permanent secretary that Mr Werritty was a friend who had a company, Pargav, which was funded by a number of donors, some of whom had provided funding to Dr Fox when in opposition.&quot; The report says Fox facilitated an introduction between Werritty and a donor. &quot;The links between Dr Fox and Werritty means that donations given to Werritty could at least be seen to be giving rise to a conflict of interest.&quot; O&apos;Donnell stated: &quot;There is no evidence that Pargav sought to win contracts from the MoD or to influence procurement decisions. Both Dr Fox and Werritty are clear that Werritty never lobbied Dr Fox on behalf of donors.&quot; No 10 insisted Werritty had co-operated with the inquiry, but some of his disgruntled financial backers, notably Jon Moulton, forced the pace by disclosing how much they had given to Werritty and how they had been unhappy at the way in which some of the money had been used. Fox issued a brief statement on Tuesday night saying he was grateful the report found there had been no threat to national security and no suggestion he gained financially from allowing his friend into heart of government. &quot;I am pleased that the report makes clear that the two most serious allegations, namely of any financial gain sought, expected or received by myself and any breach of national security, have no basis. As I said in the House of Commons last week, I accept that it was a mistake to allow the distinctions between government and private roles to become blurred, and I must take my share of the responsibility for this.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-10-19T08:45:46Z", "title": "Liam Fox to make statement following damning report", "sentences": ["It also found that Fox rejected officials&apos; requests to be present at two meetings attended by Werritty, first with businessman Harvey Boulter in Dubai in June and then with senior Israelis in Tel Aviv in February."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/19/liam-fox-statement-damning-report"}, {"tags": ["Occupy movement", "World news", "Protest", "Spain", "Europe", "Italy", "Israel", "Chile", "Chile", "Germany"], "article": "Occupy Rome Giulia Mazzorin 30 Architecture student, from Venice     Giulia Mazzorin, architecture student. Photograph: Nick Cornish    I came with my dog and met friends from Catania, Milan and Naples. I found the camp by chance last Saturday after fleeing from the clashes. I am not a member of any party. I am a virgin when it comes to protesting, but I wanted to know more about the indignados. As part of my masters I have been studying urban activism and wanted to see it up close. My conscience told me to come and find out more about this global movement. It just seemed like a mistake not to. We ended up here, saddened after the violence, and decided to stick together in one place to avoid letting the occasion end like that. My family didn&apos;t expect me to stay down here, but then nor did I. I have never taken part in protests to protect the identity of Venice, but now I am curious to know more about the events going on in Venice that are similar to this. It has been great learning how assemblies work, about dialogue between people, about creating a situation where everyone gets to be heard. It is something that could be really useful to me in life. Tom Kington Occupy Frankfurt Peter Rubach 36 Unemployed     Peter Rubach, unemployed. Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP    I didn&apos;t get to the camp until Tuesday lunchtime [it was set up on Saturday]. I heard about it on the radio and got the tram into town. I brought a rucksack containing a flask of tea and an umbrella and a toothbrush. I didn&apos;t bother bringing a tent or a sleeping bag \u2013 I&apos;ve been to these things before and there are always spares. No clean clothes either. I only live 5km away, so I can always nip home. I know people here from a protest camp two years ago in the Kelsterbach forest. We were trying to stop the airport from expanding and cutting down lovely old trees. I lived there for six months. We failed but I enjoyed the experience. I plan to stay until the bitter end. I recently lost my job in customer service after hurting my arm badly \u2013 I worked for an internet download company \u2013 and I&apos;m being paid until the end of November, so I have time. I&apos;m here for lots of reasons. I&apos;m a free spirit, a visionary. I&apos;ve been a revolutionary since birth. I believe we can&apos;t go on like this, allowing our money to be speculated, to be juggled with. We have to stop the ever-widening gap between rich and poor. I want the wealth to be redistributed \u2013 even if someone were to come out of there now [points at the European Central Bank] and say: &apos;We&apos;ve been thinking, and we&apos;ve decided to give \u20ac10m away every year to poor people in the world,&apos; I&apos;d be happy with that. It would mean we&apos;ve achieved something concrete. I live alone normally, so it&apos;s nice to be together with other people, planning the new world order. I&apos;m in the music and culture group \u2013 we&apos;re planning a concert with top headliners on Sunday. We also want to talk to the bankers, but they don&apos;t seem to want to talk to us. We know the ECB are putting pressure on the authorities, trying to get rid of us. Helen Pidd Occupy Tel Aviv Noga Klinger 34 Advertising manager with the Israeli Opera     Noga Klinger, advertising manager    I pay around half my monthly income on pre-school education for my two-year-old. It&apos;s almost like a second mortgage \u2013 and that&apos;s before you even start on the other costs of bringing up a child in Israel. Diapers here are twice the price of other countries, formula milk is very expensive. We find ourselves thinking twice about having another child because of the cost. Capitalism is not close to the basic values of Israeli society as it was built. It&apos;s gone too far. I&apos;m not talking about going back to the kibbutz, but we don&apos;t want to be like America. After the first big demo [primarily about the cost of housing], we said let&apos;s do something as parents. So we organised the stroller protests. Three days later, there were 18 parades around the country. In Tel Aviv, 6,000 parents arrived. It means there was something really burning. We all work really hard and we want to give our children a proper education, but we have to ask our parents for help. It brought up something bigger. Once people get out of their houses, they start talking to each other again, they become a community again, they care about each other. We&apos;re not the same as Greece or Spain or America or Britain, but we&apos;re part of the same global movement, and everything is connected. All the protests are about basic issues. Everyone needs a place to live, something to eat. Our generation was really disgusted by politics. But I hope now people will find their way into politics \u2013 as part of existing parties, to change them from within. Going to the street is the first step, but it will definitely show its mark in the next election.There will be a lot of parents on the next march [29 October]. We&apos;re starting to lobby the Knesset [Israeli parliament]. It&apos;s very hard to bring parents out \u2013 after a long day at work, and with childcare commitments. But there will be a lot more protests in the coming months. Harriet Sherwood Occupy Santiago Camila Gutierrez 15 Student. She has been living at school for approximately two months in a campaign for free university education and improved conditions in public schools The first days of the takeover, there were police kicking us out every day. I was here just having gone to sleep after watch duty all night, and the police told us to grab all our stuff and we had to leave. When the police show up, there are dozens and there is nothing we can do. I am still allowed by my parents to go home; I go about half the time. To be here for month after month is taking its toll on us, but we are learning to keep fighting. I have missed classes but it has made me grow as a person and learn many other things. The teenage students from Carmela Carvajal, one of Chile&apos;s most prestigious all-girl public schools now sleep on the second floor.We can see the streets from up here; we can see when the police are coming. Now that we have seen how the government reacts we are more experienced in this fight. The dialogue with the government clearly does not work, so we must come up with new tools to continue. Jonathan Franklin Occupy Athens Jasmine Rapti 30 Sculptor     Jasmine Rapti, sculptor    Greece is a mess. It isn&apos;t like any other country in Europe. What gets me out onto the streets, whenever there is a major protest, is social injustice which suffocates you on a daily basis and robs you of the opportunity to think about the future. Basic things, basic services, that make your life easier don&apos;t work. Politicians always say they are going to fix things but they never do. There is no meritocracy anywhere, especially in the public sector. You get a job if you know someone and, of course, if you want to get something done you have to use a contact, too. The health and education systems are being constantly undermined. There is no welfare system to speak of. I am an artist but in Greece, the country that gave birth to the arts, artists can no longer even get a pension. All the time, they [the government] keep taking, with more and more [austerity] measures, without ever giving anything back. They keep cutting wages and pensions without bringing down the price of products like milk and bread, which are much more expensive here than in other EU countries. For the young there is no tomorrow. It&apos;s a hopeless situation and it has to change. Ideally, I would like the capitalist system to collapse so that society can be re-organised in a fairer way. But in the absence of that I&apos;d like to see a system where at least there is meritocracy for all and the rich start paying their taxes because right now only the middle and lower classes pay them. There&apos;s a real danger that we&apos;ll go back to the 50s when Greece was very poor if we allow policies that are totally unfair to go on being enforced. All this talk of bankruptcy is a way of keeping people terrorised. Helena Smith Occupy Barcelona Merc\u00e8 Vilarrubias 47, English teacher I&apos;m indignant for a variety of reasons \u2013 the widespread corruption, the government&apos;s incapacity to respond in any meaningful way to the crisis, the poor state of the public sector. People who work hard just get poorer while the business and political class live like kings. If we identified in some way with the Arab spring it was because we could see that there, the same as here, the rich were getting rich at the expense of the poor. The strength of the movement lies in its spontaneity, its broad base, that it&apos;s both emotional and rational and isn&apos;t resigned to the idea that you can&apos;t change anything. The weakness is in finding concrete demands that everyone can sign up to. Also people will get weary if they see that they are having little effect on the political status quo. Oscar 20 Her elder son, studying psychology I&apos;m indignant about the global state of affairs and the way the Spanish government has handled the whole economic crisis. In my particular case, I have to deal with the frustration of knowing it&apos;s unlikely I&apos;ll ever become the person I want to be and there&apos;s practically nothing I can do about it. I think tThe two main strengths of the movement are the coherence of its message and the fact that all participants really do have a say. The only issue I have is its anti-leadership policy. Our cause could benefit greatly, though, if it had a face, or a few faces for that matter. And marching is not enough if we want to be taken seriously. I, if we want our voice to resonate, I think our next action should take everyone by surprise.

Say it really fast and it sound like something a magician might triumphantly gabble after pulling a rabbit from his hat. In fact, it could even be the magician&apos;s name \u2013 close your eyes and you can see him twirling his long black moustache with one hand and producing a bouquet flowers out of the sleeve of his purple velvet suit with the other, to gasps of amazement from the excited cub scouts and lost bingo players in the crowd. (Or else just sing Rubin Kazan instead of the actual chorus to this song, and see how fine that makes you feel).  But of course, if Rubin Kazan are a football team. A pretty good one, too. They haven&apos;t been scoring many goals domestically this season but they are top of this group by dint of beating Shamrock Rovers by more than Spurs did, and they have a clutch of good players \u2013 the Turk Gokdeniz Karadeniz is a right trickster, for one. And just because Spurs haven&apos;t deployed their strongest team is no cause to suspect this could be a drab affair \u2013 Giovani dos Santos was brilliant in his last outing in this competition and will no doubt be determined to produce another such display in a bid to force his way into the first XI. Same for Sandro. Jake Livermore has done well when he&apos;s had opportunities too, but he finds himself in the centre of defence tonight. So this could be fun. Maybe even as much fun as this.  Teams:Spurs: Gomes; Walker, Bassong, Livermore Rose; Lennon, Carroll, Sandro, Dos Santos; Defoe, PavlyuchenkoSubs: Cudicini, Kaboul, Modric, Falque, Townsend, Assou-Ekotto, Kane Rubin Kazan: Ryzhikov, Kuzmin, Navas, Ryanantsev, Kasaev, Noboa, Valdez, Boccheti, Karadeniz, Natcho, SharonovSubs: Arlauskis, Martins, Kaleshin, Eremenko, Kverkvelia, Orazsakhedov Ref: M De Sousa (Portugal)  7.44pm: A big call from Stan Collymore on Five. He says Kyle Walker is better going forward than Glen Johnson and &quot;will be&quot; better defensively than Micah Richards and, accordingly, will be England&apos;s first-choice right-back for years to come. I&apos;ll give him the former - Walker&apos;s superior speed makes him even more dangerous than Johnson going forward and he will probably develop the composure in the opposing box that Johnson often has - but I haven&apos;t seen any evidence that he&apos;s going to be a better defender than Richards, who has been very impressive on that front this season, as well as going forward. What do you think? And are we only leaving Chris Smalling and Phil Jones out of this discussion of England&apos;s best right-backs because we expect them to man the centre of their country&apos;s defence for years to come?  2 min: Spurs kick off. They surrender possession within 30 seconds and that gives the visitors a chance to show what they cane do: and they immediately demonstrate their smoothness on the ball, and even forge a shooting opportunity. although Natcho&apos;s header was easily saved by Gomes. Moments later Spurs hurtle down the other end and Pavlyuchenko, seeking to impress his compatriots, lets fly with a ferocious shot from 25 yards. It flies narrowly wide.  4 min: Kazan really are dinky in possession, and bold too - apparently their manager has gone to great efforts recently to make them more attacking and that new approach seems to have grown roots because they&apos;re full of enterprise. Can&apos;t see this being a 0-0.  7 min: Carroll shows tenacity to win the ball back for Tottenham as Kazan tried to get another progressive move going. Spurs&apos; forward burst ends with Defoe sending a weak low shot at the keeper from 20 yards. Meanwhile, here&apos;s Billy Benros on the England right-back issue. &quot;I agree though that Richards is - and will probably remain - a better defender than Walker,&quot; bellow Billy. &quot;As for Smalling and Jones, they are, in my opinion, competent full backs who looked great in a side that was on fire. Their subsequent performances in that position for England and a less dominant United showed that they were not as good as they were made to look initially.&quot;  10 min: Karadeniz nicks the ball off Sandro in midfield, where Spurs are being regularly outnumbered, and strides towards the home box. His shot from 20 yards is deflected wide for a corner. The delivery is good, and so is Sharonov&apos;s leap .. but he directs his downward header wide from eight yards.  13 min: Fine save by Gomes! But Spurs were prised apart far too easily there! From a throw-in on the left Kazan were able to knock the ball around a bit before Karadeniz sized ip a cross and dropped it behind Rose, right on to Natcho&apos;s head ... but he aimed his powerful effort from six yards straight at Gomes, who showed good reflexes to parry. Meanwhile, in the other match in this group, a Lazar shot from distance has given PAOK Salonika a 1-0 lead at home to Shamrock Rovers.  17 min: Dos Santos hasn&apos;t been able to get into the game much, largely because the visitors have tended to keep the ball to themselves, but he did embark on a wriggling run just now that demanded urgent intervention from the defenders at the edge of the area.  19 min: Defoe has a snap shot, just wide from 20 yards.  20 min: Again Spurs&apos; defence is cut open, as Bochetti drives to the byline and pulls the ball back for Natcho, who fails to make a proper connection from seven yards. The Russians really should be ahead by now.  21 min: Kenwyne Jones has given Stoke the lead over Maccabi Tel Aviv. Birmingham won in Bruges earlier this evening. Fulham lost 1-0 to Wisla Krawkow.  25min: Walker, raiding forward for the first time, wins a corner. It&apos;s cleared.  27 min: A defensive lapse by Kazan gifts the ball to Dos Santos, at the edge of the box. Will he shoot? Will he pass to one of the Spurs players excitedly charging up in support? No, he&apos;ll a misguided ball into the keeper&apos;s arms. Oh well.  29 min:Entirely unexpectedly, Jonathan Walters has blossomed into a fine Premier League players since going to Stoke? Is Tony Pulis going to repeat the trick with Cameron Jerome? The striker has just put them 2-0 up against Maccabi Tel Aviv.  31 min: Spurs are improving. Got a bit of forward momentum. And Rose has just won a freekick right at the edge of box, central. How about rolling it to Sandro? &quot;To be fair, Kyle has at least dignified the right back position for Tottenham,&quot; warbles Morgan Jones. &quot;For so long we were subject to likes Justin Edinburgh (shudder), Dean Austin, Chimbonda etc that it makes a change to look at a player in that position who is actually exciting rather than frightening. Plus he look like he&apos;s built like brick outhouse which is always going to give the opposition the willies.&quot;  GOAL! Spurs 1-0 Kazan (Pavlyuchenko 33&apos;) No rolling. Instead Pavlyucheno rockets the ball straight into the top corner from the freekick!  35 min: Ha! Valdez slips the ball through to Karadeniz, down the right. The Turk has a clear run through on goal but his failure to conceal his incredulity at not being given offside undoes him: he kept looking disbelievingly at the linesman, who eventually felt obliged to raise his flag. The lesson their, kids, is don&apos;t look gift passes in the mouth. Or something.  38 min: Stoke are taking Europe by storm. Or Maccabi Tel Aviv, at least. Shotton has put them 3-0 up.  41 min: Can Bocchetti do a Pavlyuchenko albeit from a tad further out? Not quite but it was a respectable effort, as his curler came down on the top of the net. Mind you, Gomes had it covered. Well, to the extent that Gomes ever truly has something covered.  44 min: Pavlyuchenko&apos;s in the mood tonight. After collecting the ball down the left channel, he turns strongly past his market and fires a powerful shot towards the far corner, bringing a full-length save from Ryzhikov.  Half-time: That was quite good. Kazan are nifty and started as if they might give Spurs a lesson but Rose and, particularly, Sandro gradually got more of a grip in midfield and Spurs finished the half strong and, of course, scored with a superb striker from Pavlyuchenko. Kazan still carry plenty of menace, though.  46 min: Here we go again.  48 min: Spurs are looking quite comfortable although Kazan are still seeing plenty of the ball. The visitors no longer seem incisive, while Spurs look dangerous every time they go forward. They have more speed and thrust. And Pavlyuchenko is truly in the groove. Navas had to make a smart tackle just now to prevent him getting off another shot.  50 min: OK&lt; Spurs aren&apos;t looking so comfortable any more. A couple of crosses and corners had the defenders scrambling and Gomes flapping just now, though they eventually managed to welly the ball to safety.  52 min: Karl Sheppard has just headed an equaliser for Shamrock Rovers in PAOK Salonika!  55 min: Oh! After a nice exchange at the edge of the box, Ryazantev cracks a shot from 16 yards. Gomes, not altogether convincingly, beats it away. The Russians have certainly regained the upper hand in the last few minutes.  58 min: A lot of polite play in midfield, first by Spurs, then by Kazan. Neither side is so bold as to attempt to infiltrate the others&apos; box. Bit of a lull going on here, is what I&apos;m saying. And not much happening in my inbox either. Is anyone still awake?  61 min: Kazan change: Kasaev off, Obafemi Martins on. Meanwhile, I&apos;m told that at the Britannia the Maccabi player Ziv, who was elbowed in the face by Jerome earlier, leading to the striker getting a red card, has just been sent off himself ... for taking his boot off and kicking it at the linesman!  63 min: Superb saving tackle by Walker to thwart Noboa, as he seemed certain to tap into the net from close range after Lennon had lost possession in the left-back position.  66 min: Spurs change: Dos Santos, who had little impact tonight, is taken off and replaced by Assou-Ekotto. Rose will presumably shift into midfield.  69 min: Spurs are just trying to keep the ball a bit to stunt Kazan&apos;s growing momentum  70 min: Ryazantsev collects the ball wide on the right, darts past Walker and sends a soft low shot that Gomes gathers gratefully. Meanwhile, Modric and Kaboul are preparing to enter the fray: Redknapp wants toe secure the three points, then.  72 min: A wonderful burst down the right and cross by Lennon. Defoe stuck in a fine header at the back post and Ryzhikov dived to tip it around the post for a corner. Bassong meets that, but his header poses no trouble to the keeper.  73 min: Spurs changes: Modric and Kaboul on, Lennon and Sandro off.  76 min: Kazan&apos;s problem, apart from their bad finishing, has been that they are too one-paced to regularly threaten. Spurs, by contrast, have had a lot less of the ball but can summon bursts of acceleration that unhinge the Russian defence, meaning they look as likely to get a second as Kazan to to equalise.  81 min: They&apos;re quite a frustrating side, Kazan. Lots of technical ability on the ball, clever movement, but a curious lack of conviction about them once they get into dangerous areas and a certain ponderousness about them at the back.  83 min: Walker to the rescue again, with another sliding tackle, this time on Martins as the Nigeria prepared to shoot. Martins them met the ensuing corner but nodded it wide from five yards.  85 min: Rose tries to blag a penalty out of the ref with an outrageous dive. The ref doesn&apos;t buy it, but nor does he book the villain.  88 min: Freekick to Kazan. To the left, about 25 yards out. Noboa curls it gently into Gomes&apos; arms.  90 min: There will be three more minutes. Even if there were three more hours, Kazan wouldn&apos;t score. They&apos;ve been frustrating.  Full-time: A fabulous freekick from Pavlyuchenko gives Tottenham victory in a match that they would have lost if the visitors could finish. Some good performances from the home team, notably from Carroll, Sandro and Pavlycuehnko. Next up is Blackburn.

Having voted against the creation of Israel at the UN in 1947, India held back from establishing full diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv until 1992. For decades, Israel&apos;s presence in India was limited to an immigration office in Mumbai. In between, India voted with the majority to pass UN resolution 3379, condemning Zionism as a form of racism, became one of the first non-Arab states to recognise Palestine&apos;s declaration of independence in 1988, and was generally among the more vocal non-Arab voices against Israel. Today, India is Israel&apos;s closest eastern ally and its largest arms market. Annual non-military bilateral trade alone exceeds $4.5bn. Since 2001, the diasporas of the two countries have emerged as energetic allies against a shared enemy: Islamic extremism. A survey by the Israeli foreign ministry in 2009 found India to be the most pro-Israel country in the world, well above the US. Once a bastion of pro-Palestinian sentiment, India recently appeared at the bottom in a worldwide poll of countries sympathetic to Palestinian statehood. Throw a stone in Panaji and it is likely to land on an Israeli backpacking through India after his post-mandatory service. What precipitated this dramatic shift? Israel had all along been a quiet ally of New Delhi, volunteering clandestine support as India sought to repel attacks by China (in 1962) and Pakistan (in 1965). Israeli officials knew also that India, which had no history of anti-semitism, had arrived at its Israel policy through a combination of post-colonial hauteur, realpolitik \u2013 particularly its desire to placate Arab opinion in its contest against Islamic Pakistan \u2013 and an ethical commitment to the Palestinian cause. Partly for these reasons, India&apos;s anti-Israel actions rarely provoked any anxiety in Tel Aviv. There are three principal reasons behind the shift in India&apos;s attitude. The first is the belated realisation that no amount of deference to Arab sentiment could alter Muslim opinion in the Middle East in India&apos;s favour: when it came to Kashmir, Shia and Sunni united in supporting Pakistan&apos;s position. The second owes itself to the collapse of the old world order: the death of the Soviet Union meant that India had to seek out new allies. The third factor that contributed to the deepening of Indo-Israeli ties is less well-known: the rise of Hindu nationalism in India. To votaries of Hindu nationalism, Israel is something of a lodestar: a nation to be revered for its ability to defeat, and survive among, hostile Muslims. As the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz put it, &quot;Relations between Israel and India tend to grow stronger when \u2026 India experiences a rightward shift in anti-Muslim public opinion or in leadership&quot;. This explains why Hindu opinion is inflamed even by the most anodyne Indian expression of solidarity with Palestine. At the UN general assembly last month India&apos;s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, offered some somniferous words of support for Palestine&apos;s membership effort: &quot;India is steadfast in its support for the Palestinian people&apos;s struggle for a sovereign, independent, viable and united state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognisable borders side by side and at peace with Israel&quot;. No one in Israel seemed to have noticed. None of the major newspapers editorialised it. There wasn&apos;t even a specific news item in the Israeli press singling out India. Trade did not suffer. The markets registered no shifts. But this did not deter some Indians from rising to take offence on Israel&apos;s behalf. To Sadanand Dhume, a US based commentator who published a hysterical philippic in the Wall Street Journal castigating India for not &quot;throwing its weight behind Israel&quot;, Singh&apos;s speech was nothing short of a &quot;foreign policy mishap&quot;. According to Dhume, who has since been ordained &quot;the go-to guy for all matters India&quot; by an excited colleague of his: &quot;Both India and Israel represent ancient civilisations whose land carries a special spiritual significance for most of its people.&quot; This desire to define citizenship and belonging in the procrustean terms of ancient culture over all other considerations is where Hindutva and Zionism converge. As Koenrad Elst, one of the most influential producers of pro-Hindutva pabulum, has said of the movement&apos;s founder, &quot;Veer Savarkar was the Hindu counterpart of a Zionist: he defined the Hindus as a nation attached to a motherland, rather than as a religious community&quot;. &quot;True, there is an obvious difference between the situation of the Jews, who had to migrate to their motherland \u2026 and the Hindus who merely had to remove the non-Hindu \u2026 regime from their territory.&quot; This prescription for ethnic cleansing came to life in 1992, when Hindu nationalists brought down the Babri mosque in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya. Their ongoing struggle to seize the Babri land, which belonged to Muslims for over five centuries, looks to Israel&apos;s appropriation of Palestinian territory as a useful template. In 2009, Mumbai&apos;s anti-terror squad arrested, among others, an officer in the Indian army, Prasad Purohit, for masterminding a terrorist attack on Pakistani citizens and plotting to overthrow the secular Indian state. In his confession, Purohit admitted to making plans to approach Israel for help. It says something about the state of Israel when the most virulently anti-Muslim terrorists in India reflexively look to it as a potential source of support. This is tragic \u2013 because, in the minds of the formidable men who willed them into existence, India and Israel were alike. Theodor Herzl&apos;s conception of Israel was remarkably similar to Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s idea of India. Both men refined their ideas gradually. In Der Judenstaat, Herzl presented Israel as a &quot;rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilisation as opposed to barbarism&quot;. Several years later, he offered a more coherent version, a blueprint for a modern pluralistic state, operating under the aegis of Jews, but self-consciously inclusive: visionary Jews and welcoming Arabs people his extraordinary novel Altneuland, one of the founding texts of Zionism. Herzl resolved the conflicts of conscience by transmitting some of the most powerful arguments for Israel&apos;s establishment through an Arab character, Reshid Bey. &quot;It was a great blessing,&quot; Reshid explains to a sceptical visitor. &quot;Nothing could have been more wretched than an Arab village at the end of the 19th century \u2026 [The Arabs] are better off than at any time in the past.&quot; But Herzl was alert to the victim&apos;s capacity to victimise. In Dr Geyer, we are shown a chilling vision of majoritarian zealotry: a fanatical rabbi, he wants all Arabs expelled from the New Society. Redemption comes in the form of David Littwak, the son of a peasant who believes in a land for all, Arab and Jew, and whose opposition to and victory over Geyer is cast as the highest affirmation of Zionism. Unlike Herzl, Gandhi scorned modern technology for most of his life. In his early life, Gandhi&apos;s politics were conspicuously exclusionary. But the India he imagined even after alighting on his Satyagraha campaign relied on a network of Indian David Littwaks to survive. It was a dream that crashed during his own lifetime, with the partition of India. Today, some of the most powerful politicians in Israel are those who violate Herzl&apos;s ideas. Avigdor Lieberman, a Russian immigrant foreign minister of Israel, has openly echoed Geyer&apos;s thoughts, calling for the expulsion of Israeli Arabs. In Gandhi&apos;s home state, Narendra Modi, a rabidly anti-Muslim politician implicated in the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002, continues to secure handsome mandates from the largely Hindu electorate. India&apos;s support for Palestine is one of the last remaining precepts from time of Pandit Nehru, India&apos;s first prime minister who is loathed by Hindu chauvinists for refusing to turn India into a &quot;Hindu Pakistan&quot;. As per the Hindu nationalist narrative, the Congress party&apos;s support for Palestine \u2013 if such a thing actually exists in any meaningful sense \u2013 is a bribe to Indian Muslims. In reality, Indian Muslims have made noticeable efforts to build bridges with Israel. But if anyone can be accused of holding foreign policy hostage to religious bigotry, it is the Hindu nationalist BJP. During its disastrous term in power, from 1997 to 2004, ministers in the government dismissed pro-Palestinians as &quot;more Palestinian than Palestinians themselves&quot;. Its foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, suggested that a common civilisational outlook bound India and Israel \u2013 implying that Indian Muslims who shared the faith of the Arab majority were somehow alien to India&apos;s &quot;civilisation&quot;. India and Israel have much to offer each other and Israel&apos;s security must figure as a non-negotiable precondition in New Delhi&apos;s support for Palestine. But Hindu nationalists are not concerned with the security of Israel: it is the abandonment of Palestinians they seek. The seeds of Israel&apos;s redemption are embedded in Zionism, which is concerned with housing people, not displacing them. Israel must merely embrace it. It will still be a paternalistic form of &quot;pluralism&quot;, but it will be inclusive. On the other hand, Hindutva&apos;s very purpose is the disenfranchisement and abolition of religious minorities. So Israelis must wonder what has become of them, their nation, that their most fervid admirers in the most pro-Israeli country in the world happen to be fascists. Until Israel and India undertake an honest reappraisal of their friendship, those who care about the ideas of Herzl and Gandhi must acknowledge this much: theirs is an alliance deepened by prejudice. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T10:25:00Z", "title": "India and Israel: a friendship deepened by prejudice | Kapil Komireddi", "sentences": ["Having voted against the creation of Israel at the UN in 1947, India held back from establishing full diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv until 1992.", "Partly for these reasons, India&apos;s anti-Israel actions rarely provoked any anxiety in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/25/india-israel-friendship-prejudice-muslim"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gilad Shalit", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "The posters are still up, showing the face of Gilad Shalit, the boy soldier freed last week after five years hidden in the dark. &quot;How good it is to have you back home,&quot; runs the slogan, appearing on the side of shopping malls in Tel Aviv and on lampposts in Jerusalem. Shalit&apos;s return has enabled Israelis to walk with an unaccustomed spring in their step, despite their fear that the price was dreadfully high. It should go without saying that Israelis would have preferred a one-to-one exchange, releasing a single Palestinian prisoner, rather than more than a thousand \u2013 many of them guilty of horrendous acts of violence \u2013 in return for Shalit. But, contrary to what some have suggested, it was Hamas, not Israel, that set that 1:1000 exchange rate; it was Hamas, not Israel, who decided that the freedom of a single Israeli was worth the freedom of a thousand Palestinians. Yet the boost at Shalit&apos;s return is unlikely to last long. Just as the sight of his emaciated face and sunken eyes on every front page confirms that the damage of his captivity will haunt him for years, so Israelis who yearn for the security that can only come with an accommodation with their neighbours know there is no remedy imminent for them either. Except now the familiar pessimism comes with a twist. While their own government has next to no strategy to resolve the conflict, it is now the Palestinians, so often buffeted by events, who have a plan and are pursuing it. The problem is that both strategies, old and new, are insufficient. Start with the Israeli position. A series of conversations with senior figures in the Israeli government reduces to a single public message: Israel wants to return to direct talks with the Palestinians without preconditions. What&apos;s more, colleagues of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, point to a series of statements and signals, overlooked by both the Palestinians and world opinion, which indicate that, if Netanyahu were engaged in a serious face-to-face process, he would push for a genuine agreement. One well-placed insider said that in the prime minister&apos;s office the man with the highest hopes for negotiations is the prime minister himself, imagining that, when it came to it, he and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could make a breakthrough: &quot;He puts himself in the other guy&apos;s shoes, thinking that &apos;maybe he&apos;ll take the jump with me&apos;.&quot; To that end, the Netanyahu team tells me, they have repeatedly sought to draw Abbas into talks. Every attempt has been rebuffed, they say, &quot;the door slammed in our face&quot;. There are multiple problems with this account, but they all come down to a single word: credibility. For every encouraging smoke signal sent out by Netanyahu \u2013 aides mention his talk of &quot;creativity&quot; in resolving the radioactive issue of Jerusalem \u2013 there is at least one telegraphing an opposite message, often in the very same paragraph: that promise of &quot;creativity&quot;, for example, came with a warning that Jerusalem must forever remain the undivided capital of Israel, thereby closing the door on a key Palestinian demand. Nothing renders Netanyahu&apos;s offers of peace talks less credible to Palestinian ears than settlement building. I saw for myself the expansion of, among other places, the town of Beitar Illit across the Green Line that separates pre-1967 Israel from the West Bank. With some 35,000 residents, Beitar Illit now hems in the Palestinian village of Wadi Fukin, choking off all future growth. Israelis say that such building does not connote bad faith: almost all of it is under way in blocs that will &quot;inevitably&quot; be allocated to Israel in any eventual peace deal \u2013 in return for land from inside Israel-proper \u2013 and that in previous negotiations Palestinians have conceded as much. But such thinking breaks a necessary rule of peacemaking: one side cannot bank concessions by the other until the entire deal is done. And no deal was done. Until it is, expanding settlements in occupied territory \u2013 recognised as illegal by almost every country except Israel \u2013 is bound to undermine any call for the Palestinians to come to the table. As Husam Zomlot, a senior figure in Fatah, put it to me in Ramallah: &quot;You can&apos;t have discussions about how we are going to share a pizza, while one side is eating the pizza.&quot; This is a problem that predates Bibi. Palestinians say this has been the story of the 18 years since the Oslo accords of 1993: endless on-and-off talks, while the material facts on the ground \u2013 from new roads to restrictions on access and movement \u2013 change and the settler population more than trebles. It is this which, above all, makes the call to resume talks not credible to Palestinian ears: why should they sit around talking for another 18 years, watching as more of their land is nibbled away? Accordingly, the Palestinians have devised another strategy. They plan to rely no longer on direct negotiations which they believe are hopelessly asymmetric, the power tilted so heavily in Israel&apos;s favour. Those I spoke to insist there is no plan to return to violence, believing that the second intifada, with its suicide bombings of Israeli buses, pizzerias and discos, proved totally counterproductive \u2013 triggering an Israeli military response that rolled back not the occupation but most of the gains the Palestinians had made in the previous decade, destroying much that had been built up. The new Palestinian strategy will involve neither &quot;armed struggle&quot;, nor a return to &quot;meaningless, open-ended negotiations&quot;. Instead it will try to deploy other tools. The first is &quot;internationalisation&quot;, seeking to change the Israel-Palestine conflict from a bilateral dispute between the two parties into a problem for the world community to resolve: hence last month&apos;s statehood application to the UN and a current request to join Unesco. The aim is to ratchet up international pressure to such a degree that when the two sides do eventually return to the table \u2013 and Zomlot is adamant that &quot;without negotiations this conflict can never end&quot; \u2013 they will be, if not equally powerful, then closer to parity than ever before. And there could be an additional pressure. There is hopeful talk of a &quot;Palestinian spring&quot;, a popular movement demanding independence that world opinion would find hard to oppose, one inspired by the first, stone-throwing intifada begun in 1987 rather than by the murderous second one that began in 2000. Such an uprising would also put pressure on the Israeli government to make the concessions necessary for peace, much as the first intifada pushed Israel into the Madrid and Oslo processes. There are problems here too, starting with the fact that the first target of a Palestinian spring could well be the unreformed, still-corrupt Palestinian Authority \u2013 and that an initially nonviolent effort risks spiralling out of control. As for internationalisation, just as years of talks have not brought Palestinian independence, countless UN resolutions have not achieved much tangible for the Palestinians either. One diplomat says the old Israeli strategy and the new Palestinian one boils down to this: the Israelis want a process but no peace, the Palestinians want peace but no process. That may be glib, but it&apos;s clear both strategies are incomplete. What&apos;s needed is either for Netanyahu, if he is serious, to make a gesture large and surprising enough to overcome Palestinian suspicion and render him credible \u2013 or for the international community to take charge of a refashioned peace process, gripping it the way London and Dublin oversaw the Northern Ireland negotiations. Either way, what is currently on offer is not enough \u2013 and will mean the end of this unending conflict slipping ever further out of sight.  twitter.com/j_freedland\u00a0 \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T17:48:00Z", "title": "Gilad Shalit has been brought home to an Israel that has no plan for peace | Jonathan Freedland", "sentences": ["&quot;How good it is to have you back home,&quot; runs the slogan, appearing on the side of shopping malls in Tel Aviv and on lampposts in Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/25/israel-palestinian-peace-plan"}, {"tags": ["William Hill", "Business", "Internet", "Technology", "Gambling", "UK news"], "article": "Peace has finally broken out between Britain&apos;s largest bookmaker, William Hill, and employees in its online operations after a walkout this month threatened the company&apos;s fast-growing internet business. Nearly 200 staff had refused to work at William Hill&apos;s offices in Tel Aviv, which handle marketing and customer support for its online services, believing the bookmaker was intending to close down the operation and relocate to either Britain or Gibraltar. The strike prompted copycat actions in offices in Bulgaria and the Philippines and followed the abrupt resignation last month of Eyal Sanoff, the chief marketing officer in Israel. The bookmaker, which sacked seven senior managers as a result of the staff action, said discussions in Israel had resulted in a settlement at the Tel Aviv and Bulgaria offices of William Hill Online, which is 79% owned by William Hill and 21% by the Aim-listed Israeli technology company Playtech. Last week, the company resolved a similar disruption by staff in a Playtech business in Manila, where William Hill Online is a sizeable customer. &quot;The group can now confirm that normal operations have resumed and that William Hill Online remains committed to its operation in Tel Aviv,&quot; William Hill said in a statement. The company was also keen to point to the discussions in Tel Aviv involving its chief executive, Ralph Topping, and Playtech&apos;s boss, Mor Weizer, following industry gossip that the relationship between the joint venture partners had broken down. Even so, it is believed that relations between Playtech&apos;s 40% shareholder, Teddy Sagi, and William Hill remain tricky. Sagi is known to be close to Sanoff. Weizer said: &quot;Having been asked by Ralph Topping to assist, I am very pleased that this issue is now behind William Hill\u00a0Online.&quot; It is believed that some senior managers at William Hill Online had been plotting to set up a rival business, but the peace deal is understood to have involved them agreeing to non-compete clauses in exchange for an undisclosed payoff, which is thought to be around \u00a32m.

On a night when Newcastle United extended their unbeaten start in the Premier League season to 10 matches and climbed above Chelsea in the process to claim third spot, Ba registered his second hat-trick of the campaign to come back to haunt the manager that pulled out of signing him in January. &quot;A massive risk&quot; and &quot;a ticking time bomb&quot; was how Tony Pulis, the Stoke manager, described Ba when he was asked about the player&apos;s medical reports after the deal with Hoffenheim broke down. How he must be regretting his decision to turn down a striker that inspired Newcastle to a victory that will force the rest of the Premier League to take their renaissance under Alan Pardew seriously. This was only the second time Stoke have lost a home game in the league this year but they could have no complaints about the outcome as Newcastle executed their game plan perfectly. The visitors worked tirelessly to close Stoke down on the flanks, defended stoutly in the face of the inevitable aerial onslaught that followed in the second half and counterattacked with alacrity. Ba was unquestionably the star of the show. Only Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have scored more Premier League goals than the 15 Ba has now collected for West Ham United and Newcastle during the calendar year. It was the perfect riposte to the Stoke supporters who booed him. &quot;If they want to boo, they should boo their board,&quot; Ba said. &quot;I was there to sign but they didn&apos;t want me. I&apos;m very happy to get a hat-trick because we&apos;ve struggled to get a win here. We were terrific as a team.&quot; Pulis was left to bemoan the poor defending that preceded Ba&apos;s first two goals on an evening when Stoke looked like a team struggling to cope with the relentless demands of competing in Europe and the Premier League. They face Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel on Thursday and travel to Bolton Wanderers on Sunday at the end of a run of seven matches in 22 days. The schedule promises to be just as punishing as the sight of Ba walking off with the match ball. &quot;We really fancied Demba for a while but I think what people have to remember is that we weren&apos;t getting Demba on a free transfer; we were actually paying \u00a39m for him and with his wages and everything else it was a massive package,&quot; Pulis said. &quot;And his knee \u2013 the medical people at this football club are fantastic and they didn&apos;t think that was a risk we could take at that time. If we were taking him on a free transfer that would have been a different option. He&apos;s certainly done well at West Ham and at Newcastle.&quot; His first two goals could not have been more straightforward. Leon Best strayed offside in the buildup to the first but the assistant referee&apos;s flag stayed down and the forward flicked the ball into the space behind Marc Wilson, the Stoke left-back, who was caught in no man&apos;s land. Gabriel Obertan delivered a wonderful centre and Ba, completely unmarked, headed past Asmir Begovic. The second came after Matthew Upson, who came on for the injured Ryan Shawcross, headed weakly in the direction of Best. After taking a couple of touches, Best sliced his shot and Ba was perfectly positioned to prod over the line. Stoke improved after the interval and were thrown a lifeline when Ba blotted his copybook by barging over Peter Crouch. Jon Walters beat Tim Krul from the spot and the Britannia Stadium, which had been so quiet for so long, finally found its voice. Ba, however, quickly turned down the volume back down when he dispatched a penalty in the 80th minute, after Robert Huth nudged into Best. &quot;Don&apos;t think that&apos;s a one off from Demba,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;He&apos;s been terrific for me.&quot; As have the rest of the players that have restored some pride to Tyneside. &quot;We have an immediate goal in front of us,&quot; said Pardew. &quot;We are playing against an Everton side on Saturday with some very good players and a manager, in David Moyes, who is one of the best in the world. If we can get through that game and go to Manchester City unbeaten, that would be fantastic. I hope we can fill the stadium because I think the players deserve that.

But while the Obama administration is desperate to avoid another conflict \u2013 it would be America&apos;s fourth in a decade \u2013 the drumbeat from Israel has been growing louder. The Israeli cabinet was reported on Wednesday to be debating whether to launch air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in the coming weeks. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the defence minister, Ehud Barak, are lobbying in favour of action, but other senior ministers are urging caution. In response, Iran has warned, as it has in the past, that any attack by Israel would result in retaliation against the US. The Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Hassan Firouzabadi, Iran&apos;s military chief, as saying: &quot;The Zionist regime&apos;s military attack against Iran will inflict heavy damages to the US as well as the Zionist regime.&quot; The rhetoric from Tel Aviv and Tehran is making some within the Obama administration nervous. A Washington official familiar with the issue acknowledged the temperature has been rising and that Israel introduced an unpredictable element. He reiterated, however, that the policy of the Obama administration was to pursue all diplomatic channels, backed by tougher sanctions, and avoid military action. &quot;I do not think the US has the stomach for it,&quot; Sam Gardiner, a retired air force colonel who taught strategy at the National War College and who has specialised in carrying out war games targeting Iran, said. But if Israel went ahead, it would be difficult for the US to stay out. &quot;The US would have to be involved and finish it,&quot; he said. A congressional hearing on Iran last week was told that the Pentagon has a series of contingency plans for military action, ranging from all-out war to limited operations. Obama had signed off on these, the hearing was told. Retired general Jack Keane was hawkish, urging escalation. &quot;We&apos;ve got to put our hand around their throat now,&quot; he said. The hearing was told options included increased covert action, more cyberwarfare and sanctions that would target the Iranian central bank, a serious move that Iran might regard as tantamount to a declaration of war. But Keane and other military colleagues giving evidence on Capitol Hill all stopped short of advocating an air strike against Iran. That has been line for years from the Pentagon, which sees all-out war against Iran as the worst of options. The issue of a possible military attack on Iran was reignited in Israel by influential columnist Nahum Barnea last Friday. &quot;Rumours are increasing about an Israeli offensive that would change the face of the Middle East and perhaps seal the fate of the Jewish state for the coming generations,&quot; he wrote. Members of the inner cabinet swiftly tried to put a lid on conjecture. The intelligence affairs minister and deputy prime minister, Dan Meridor, said the issue should not be a matter of public debate. &quot;A public debate about this is nothing less than a scandal \u2026 The public elected a government to make decisions about things like this in secret. The public&apos;s right to know does not include the debate about classified matters like this,&quot; he said. Israel test-fired a &quot;rocket propulsion system&quot; capable of striking Iran on Wednesday, adding to speculation over its intentions regarding military action. However, defence officials said the exercise had been planned for a long time. With the next White House election 13 months away, an Israeli attack on Iran is Obama&apos;s nightmare. It would be hard for a president to sell another conflict to a war-weary American public on top of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. There might be a temporary rallying round the flag but Obama would lose the Democratic left, the base he needs to get out and campaign for him. That would be problematic for a president facing a tight election. But there is an even bigger problem: the impact of rising oil prices \u2013 an almost certain consequence of conflict \u2013 on the faltering US recovery. Karim Sadjadpour, one of the leading analysts in the US on relations with Iran, based at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is sceptical about the chances of war with Iran. &quot;A US military attack on Iran is not going to happen during Obama&apos;s presidency. If you&apos;re Obama, and your priority is to resuscitate the American economy and decrease the US footprint in the Middle East, bombing Iran would defeat those two objectives. Oil prices would skyrocket.&quot; Larry Sabato, a widely-respected political analyst and professor of politics at the University of Virginia, shared the scepticism, though he noted that Obama was more bellicose than people had expected. &quot;He has not been hesistant to use force. And that has surprised not just the left but people round the world. I am not sure he would get the Nobel peace prize now. Just as well he got it early,&quot; he said. If there was to be a conflict, it would be better late next year, close to the election, rather than during the remainder of this year or early next. &quot;We always talk about October surprises and we would have people rallying round the flag if there was sufficient justification. October means the election would be held before the US becomes mired down in conflict or faces a boomerang effect,&quot; Sabato said. Israel is not alone in talking about military action against Iran. Among the state department documents disclosed by WikiLeaks was one in Saudi Arabia called for action to chop what it called &quot;the head of the snake&quot;. The attitude of the Obama adminstration towards Iran is well illustrated by the episode in which allegations surfaced of an Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington with the help of a Mexican drug cartel. If the US was finally bowing to pressure from not just Israel but Saudi Arabia, the alleged Iranian plot would have been a useful casus belli or at least the start of a softening up process in preparation for war. Instead, Obama administration staff briefed privately almost immediately that a military response was not being contemplated, not even sending more naval vessels to the Gulf or announcing new military manoeuvres in the region.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-02T17:52:16Z", "title": "Is the US heading for war with Iran?", "sentences": ["The Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Hassan Firouzabadi, Iran&apos;s military chief, as saying: &quot;The Zionist regime&apos;s military attack against Iran will inflict heavy damages to the US as well as the Zionist regime.&quot; The rhetoric from Tel Aviv and Tehran is making some within the Obama administration nervous."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/us-heading-war-iran-obama"}, {"tags": ["Europa League 2011-12", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "PSV Eindhoven and Legia Warsaw secured qualification from Group C of the Europa League.

Warsaw made the knockout stages after beating Rapid Bucharest 3-1 in a fiery encounter in Poland in which both sides finished with 10 men. Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao also qualified for the knockout stages, edging Salzburg 1-0 with a first-half goal from Ander Herrera. The Basque club&apos;s unbeaten streak extended to nine games in all competitions under the former Argentina and Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa. Paris Saint-German moved into second place in the group with a 1-0 win over Slovan Bratislava, as the French club&apos;s \u00a336m signing Javier Pastore proved his worth by scoring with a 63rd-minute volley. Bratislava were eliminated with one point. Co Adriaanse&apos;s FC Twente guaranteed progression to the knockout stages from Group K after the substitute Leroy Fer&apos;s 82nd-minute strike gave them a 3-2 win over the Danish side Odense BK. Fulham also closed in on qualification as goals from Damien Duff, Steve Sidwell and an Andrew Johnson brace earned a 4-1 win over Wisla Krakow at Craven Cottage. Braga thrashed Maribor 5-1 to join Birmingham City and Club Brugge on seven points in a tightly contested Group H. Chris Hughton&apos;s side came from 2-0 down against the Belgians at St Andrew&apos;s, thanks to a second-half strike from Jean Beausejour and Marlon King&apos;s 74th-minute penalty. The Belgian league leaders, Anderlecht, also made sure of qualification for the next stage after extending their 100% record in Group L to four games with a 3-0 thrashing of Sturm Graz. Ariel Jacobs&apos;s side were always in control with Guillaume Gillet giving them the half-time lead with his 23rd-minute goal and Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez and Tom de Sutter adding to their tally after the break. Lokomotiv Moscow are almost certain to qualify alongside Anderlecht after they eased past the Greek side AEK Athens, who are still without a point. Goals from Denis Glushakov, Maicon and Vladislav Ignatyev helped them to a 3-1 victory. The Celtic manager, Neil Lennon, hailed his injury-ravaged team&apos;s 3-1 win over Rennes as &quot;a miracle&quot;.

Celtic can still qualify from Group I, with games against the two teams above them, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Udinese \u2013 who were thrashed 4-0 in Madrid \u2013 still to come. Lazio beat FC Zurich 1-0 to keep their qualification hopes alive in Group D, while Denis Zmeu&apos;s first-half goal for the Romanian side FC Vaslui against Sporting Lisbon, who have already qualified, kept them right in contention in second place on five points, the same total as the Italians. The Shamrock Rovers manager, Michael O&apos;Neill, praised PAOK Salonika as his side saw their hopes of progressing to the Europa League knockout stages end after a 3-1 defeat in Dublin. The PAOK striker Dimitris Salpingidis&apos;s first-half brace and Giorgos Fotakis&apos;s finish low into the left corner of the goal gave the Greek side a comfortable 3-0 lead at half-time, before Billy Dennehy pulled back a consolation goal after the break.

Anglo, which already speaks for 45% of De Beers, will emerge with 85% once the deal is completed in a move that will give it a leading role in the global diamond market. Although De Beers has endured a difficult recession with sales and profits plummeting, trading has recovered with strong demand from emerging markets such as India and China. Prices have jumped recently by an 40% since the start of the year, propelled by the growing popularity of diamond-encrusted rings with Chinese brides. The government of Botswana owns the outstanding 15% of De Beers but has the option to increase its stake to 25%, which could cut Anglo&apos;s stake to 75%. De Beers was established in South Africa in 1880 by Cecil Rhodes, the English-born politician and businessman who went on to found Rhodesia, renamed Zimbabwe in 1979. The company&apos;s name is synonymous with diamonds and its advertising slogans have included the ubiquitous &quot;diamonds are forever&quot;. Analysts suggested that the Oppenheimers are selling because there is no clear successor to Nicky Oppenheimer, chairman of De Beers, who is in his sixties. Archie Kane at Liberum Capital said: &quot;There is no obvious family member coming through the ranks to take management control.&quot; The Oppenheimers have held sway at De Beers since the late 1920s. Traders speculated that Anglo could one day spin off De Beers into a separately listed company, something that Anglo shareholders would welcome. Several institutional investors have complained that the value of Anglo&apos;s holding in De Beers is not fully reflected in its share price. Last month, the Observer interviewed one stakeholder who said: &quot;Hardly anyone in the City knows how to value a diamond company, but if you ask the experts in Antwerp, Mumbai or Tel Aviv, they will tell you Anglo doesn&apos;t get full credit for its De Beers holding.&quot; But at the price Anglo is paying for the De Beers stake, the diamond company is valued at nearly \u00a38bn, several billion pounds above estimates that have been circulating in the Square Mile. Anglo and De Beers have always played down or denied stories that a deal was in the offing, but on Friday chief executive Cynthia Carroll admitted it was an acquisition she had long coveted. She said: &quot;This transaction is a unique opportunity for Anglo American to consolidate control of the world&apos;s leading diamond company.&quot; Nicky Oppenheimer, representing the family interests, said: &quot;This has been a momentous and difficult decision as my family has been in the diamond industry for more than 100 years and part of De Beers for more than 80 years. After careful and deliberate consideration of the offer, and what is in the best interests of the family, we unanimously agreed to accept Anglo American&apos;s offer.&quot; The Financial Times reported that when Carroll was asked why she had not bid for the stake when prices were lower, she replied: &quot;Where there is a buyer, there has got to be a seller \u2013 that&apos;s the bottom line.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-11-04T14:40:48Z", "title": "Anglo American gains controlling stake in De Beers", "sentences": ["Last month, the Observer interviewed one stakeholder who said: &quot;Hardly anyone in the City knows how to value a diamond company, but if you ask the experts in Antwerp, Mumbai or Tel Aviv, they will tell you Anglo doesn&apos;t get full credit for its De Beers holding.&quot; But at the price Anglo is paying for the De Beers stake, the diamond company is valued at nearly \u00a38bn, several billion pounds above estimates that have been circulating in the Square Mile."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/04/anglo-american-debeers-diamonds"}, {"tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Books", "Culture", "War reporting", "Media"], "article": "There is a passage in Despatches, Michael Herr&apos;s viscerally powerful memoir of his time as a war correspondent in Vietnam in the late 60s, in which he describes seeing a photograph of an American marine &quot;pissing into the locked-open mouth of a decomposing North Vietnamese soldier&quot;. He goes on to describe albums full of what soldiers call trophy photographs, some with pictures of Viet Cong women who had been stripped and humiliated, others with more graphic images of grinning American soldiers holding up the severed heads of Viet Cong fighters or necklaces made of human ears. &quot;There were hundreds of those albums in Vietnam, thousands \u2026 &quot; Herr wrote. Most of them were never at the time seen, except by the soldiers who took them and the soldiers that posed for them. In 1970, though, the court martial of 14 American army officers for their part in the infamous My Lai massacre of 16 March 1968, in which over 400 civilians were killed, relied heavily on photographs taken by an army photographer, Ron Haeberle. He had taken them on his personal camera and kept them hidden until November 1969, when he sold them to CBS news. In her thought-provoking new book, Private Pictures, Janina Struk mentions the My Lai photographs only in passing, and with particular reference to the more recent images of American soldiers abusing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. &quot;Like the Abu Ghraib pictures,&quot; she writes, &quot;those taken at My Lai had come to symbolise all that was wrong with the war in Vietnam \u2013 although they never became iconic images.&quot; The world has changed since then. Now anyone with an internet connection can see countless images of war atrocities, gruesomely posed trophy shots and even footage of casual but deadly violence against civilians, all taken \u2013 and often disseminated \u2013 by serving soldiers. In a chapter called &quot;The Inside View of War&quot;, Struk concentrates mainly on one website which, by 2005, &quot;had more than 150,000 registered users, including about 45,000 military personnel and 180,000 daily visitors accessing amateur pornography and more than 5,000 (mainly American) soldiers&apos; pictures&quot;. The book traces the history of soldiers&apos; photographs, which are almost as old as photography itself, beginning with a small stash of black-and-white portraits discovered by the British war reporter Robert Fisk in 1998 in the attic of his mother&apos;s house. They were taken by his father, Second Lieutenant William Fisk, who had served in the first world war. They seem innocent now \u2013 posing comrades, a few single portraits, a murky view of no man&apos;s land taken from a trench in France in the last days of the war \u2013 but they were illegal, and possession of such private pictures could lead to a court martial and a possible death sentence. Despite this, as Struk notes, &quot;thousands of soldiers from all sides took their cameras to the first world war. The question was, why?&quot; It is a question that resounds though this fascinating book, and the answer seems to have more to do with human curiosity and the urge to record one&apos;s personal experience to compare it with \u2013 or set it against \u2013 the official view of history. One dramatic recent example of this was a photo exhibition entitled Bringing Hebron to Tel Aviv, curated by Breaking the Silence, an organisation made up of former soldiers who had served with the Israel Defence Forces in the occupied Palestinian territories. By revealing their private pictures and thus breaking the law, they were, writes Struk, &quot;confronting Israel society with the photographic evidence of what they called the &apos;terrible moral price&apos; of occupation and asking it to judge for itself&quot;. In a strangely mundane way, Stuart Griffiths&apos;s new photobook, sarcastically titled The Myth of the Airborne Warrior, asks the same kind of question \u2013 albeit rather belatedly \u2013 of British society. It is made up of Griffiths&apos;s personal snapshots of his tours of duty in Northern Ireland as a young soldier with the Parachute Regiment. The photographs, which were taken on a humble Canon Sure Shot, often look snatched or have been taken from a distance so that the housing estates and streets of tribally divided, working-class Belfast look even bleaker and more threatening than they are. He captures his fellow paras at rest and at play \u2013 one guy poses with a rifle barrel in his mouth; another shows off his black eye \u2013 as well as on patrol though the republican areas, where the graffiti singles out the paras for particular loathing and disdain: the fallout from their killing of 13 civilians on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. The small book has little context save for Griffiths&apos;s own first-person text, which has been heavily edited in black marker to highlight the most shocking anecdotes in direct contrast with the mundanity of the images. There is also a short essay by Gordon MacDonald of Photoworks that concentrates on the images as evidence of Griffiths&apos;s personal experience as a serving soldier from a working-class background, which began with &quot;great aspiration&quot; and ended in &quot;severe disillusionment&quot;. Tucked into each copy of this first print run of 500 are ephemera from his time as a squaddie: anti-British army leaflets distributed by the IRA; an official government leaflet outlining &quot;instructions for opening fire in Northern Ireland&quot;. I also received a signed print of one of the photos: a pretty amateurish portrait of a soldier standing in front of a republican paramilitary mural \u2013 taken from a safe distance. It made me feel oddly nostalgic for my misspent youth being daily harassed by working-class guys in uniform like Griffiths and the dangerous thrill of taking revenge with bricks, bottles and some obscenely poetic taunts about their parentage and their homeland. An odd little book, then, of one soldier&apos;s wilfully unprofessional but curiously revealing photographs \u2013 but an evocative one for that very reason. Now see this: Believing Is Seeing is an intriguing group show at Ffotogallery, Cardiff, comprising the work of seven contemporary artists from Korea who utilise photography in different ways. The unifying theme is Korean-ness, as implied in the &quot;Junsinsajo&quot; portrait painting tradition, which replicates the subject&apos;s shape and spirit.

Over recent months, women&apos;s faces have disappeared from billboards across the city amid mounting pressure applied by the powerful ultra-orthodox lobby, who find the female image offensive. Several advertisers have erased female models from their posters in Jerusalem. Elsewhere in Israel, the winter campaign of Israeli clothing brand Honigman features a model cosily dressed in winter knits. In the capital, the woman&apos;s head has been removed from the image, leaving just her arm and a handbag. Companies that do not fall in line with the standards of the extreme ultra-orthodox have frequently fallen victim to direct action. Across Jerusalem, female figures have been blacked out of billboards with spray-paint, or vandalised with graffiti branding the image &quot;illegal&quot;. Other posters are simply torn down. On Sunday, Barkat wrote a letter to district police commander Niso Shaham in which he said: &quot;We must make sure that those who want to advertise [with] women&apos;s images in the city can do so without fear of vandalism and defacement of billboards or buses showing women.&quot; Police have confirmed an increase in vandalism on the borders of Jerusalem&apos;s closed ultra-orthodox neighbourhoods. Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police would be stepping up patrols to prevent further acts of hooliganism and ensure it is investigated. Rosenfeld added that despite being pelted with stones, police officers made several arrests in the orthodox Meah Shearim neighbourhood last week. But activists claim the battle over Jerusalem&apos;s billboards is only one manifestation of an alarming trend towards gender segregation across Israel driven by the religious right. Activist Hila Benyovich-Hoffman was spurred to take action by reports that nine male cadets in the Israeli Defence Force had walked out of an army event in September because women were singing. Four were expelled from an officer&apos;s training course for refusing to apologise. &quot;This was the final straw for me, that these cadets could humiliate female soldiers because some rabbi has told them that a woman&apos;s voice is indecent. The army used to be a source of pride because women served alongside men as equals. But more and more, rabbis are influencing army behaviour,&quot; Benyovich-Hoffman said. She organised a series of demonstrations last Friday in which hundreds of women gathered for &quot;singalongs&quot; in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and Beersheva to demand their right to a public presence. She says much more needs to be done. It is not just secular Israelis that have been moved to protest. Members of the Haredi ultra-orthodox community themselves are reporting a rise in assaults on women. One orthodox website reported this week that three orthodox girls had been physically attacked in Jerusalem for dressing immodestly. The Israeli Religious Action Centre (IRAC) was founded more than a decade ago to take on the fight against gender segregation, which is illegal in Israel. They receive around four calls a day from mostly orthodox Jewish women complaining of segregation in medical centres, on pavements, in post offices, graveyards and, most often, on buses. The centre estimates that daily, between 500 and 600 bus journeys in Israel are segregated. &quot;I feel like a fire fighter \u2013 this issue spreads and spirals like a fire,&quot; saids the IRAC&apos;s director Anat Hofman. &quot;But the fact that our case load is increasing is a good thing \u2013 it means more people are sensitive to the problem and are prepared to stand up against it.&quot; Jerusalem&apos;s deputy mayor, Naomi Tsur, admits the situation is &quot;deplorable&quot; but also says that women&apos;s rights have never had a better chance of flourishing in Jerusalem. For decades until November 2008, under the leadership of an orthodox mayor, billboards featuring women simply weren&apos;t allowed in the city. Tsur said: &quot;We are talking about a very extreme group of people who don&apos;t recognise the authority of the city, the police, the government or the high court. It is critically important that we don&apos;t let this minority dominate.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-11-15T19:16:22Z", "title": "Jerusalem mayor battles ultra-orthodox groups over women-free billboards", "sentences": ["She organised a series of demonstrations last Friday in which hundreds of women gathered for &quot;singalongs&quot; in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and Beersheva to demand their right to a public presence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/15/jerusalem-mayor-battle-orthodox-billboards"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "The Mossad", "Israel", "World news", "US news", "CIA", "Nuclear weapons"], "article": "Iran has insisted that an explosion that killed the architect of its missile programme was not carried out by Israel or the US, despite widespread reports that it was the work of the Israeli secret service, the Mossad. On Saturday a huge blast at the Alghadir missile base at Bid Ganeh, 30 miles to the west of Tehran, killed 17 of the country&apos;s elite revolutionary guards, including Major General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, a senior commander described as the pioneer of the regime&apos;s missile programme. A senior Iranian military official on Wednesday denied reports that Israel was linked to the blast.\u00a0Speaking at a ceremony commemorating those killed on Saturday, Iran&apos;s armed forces joint chief of staff, Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, said in quotes carried by the semi-official Fars\u00a0news agency: &quot;The recent incident and blast is not related to Israel or America.&quot; Firouzabadi said that the explosion has disrupted the production of &quot;a very important product&quot; but the base would resume working soon, without elaborating on the nature of what the base had been making. It is believed that the Alghadir base is a depot for Iran&apos;s Shahab-3 missiles, which have a range of 1,200 miles, making them capable of reaching Israel. After the incident Iran was quick to state publicly that an accident caused the explosion, saying that it happened while ammunitions were being moved. But anonymous sources with close ties to Tel Aviv and Tehran have since spoken to the press alleging that the Mossad was behind it. Iran regularly points the finger at Israel and the US as the source of internal disputes but this time Tehran leaders are adamant that their enemies are innocent. In recent years Iran&apos;s nuclear programme has experienced a series of dramatic setbacks by the assassination of its scientists and a computer worm\u00a0believed to have been designed to sabotage the country&apos;s enrichment of uranium. These incidents, seen as part of a covert war against Iran led by Israel, aimed at halting its nuclear activities, have given weight to speculation that Saturday&apos;s blast could also be part of a shadow war over Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, but this time with the aim of halting the regime&apos;s missile progress. Many analysts believe that Israel and its\u00a0allies have opted for a covert war instead of a costly military strike, which is believed to be difficult to achieve. Time magazine reported on Sunday that\u00a0the Mossad carried out the blast through sabotage, citing western intelligence sources. An Iranian source with close ties to the clerical establishment told the Guardian that Israel was responsible. If an Israeli link to the blast turns out to be true, the Iranian government would be hugely embarrassed by the extent of the enemy&apos;s access to its most sensitive activities. Several Iranian officials have therefore stepped forward, echoing Firouzabadi&apos;s comments and ruling out the possibility\u00a0of the involvement of a foreign hand, even before an internal investigation has properly begun.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-16T19:48:07Z", "title": "Iran says missile base blast was not caused by Israeli intelligence", "sentences": ["But anonymous sources with close ties to Tel Aviv and Tehran have since spoken to the press alleging that the Mossad was behind it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/iran-missile-blast-israel-mossad"}, {"tags": ["Palestine holidays", "Middle East holidays", "Travel", "Jerusalem holidays", "City breaks", "Top 10s", "Adventure travel", "Short breaks"], "article": "For most people, the words Palestine or West Bank won&apos;t shout holiday destination.

This tiny area packs in more historical, religious and cultural heritage than perhaps anywhere else in the world, and its small size means it&apos;s completely feasible to visit a good proportion of its sights in a fairly short trip. Several new community tourism and hiking or biking holiday operators also make experiencing Palestine&apos;s stunning scenery and great food increasingly easy. The vast majority of travellers to Palestine visit over Christmas, when Bethlehem sees thousands of visitors for Midnight Mass. Leaders of the various Christian denominations lead processions from Jerusalem, and Manger Square fills with boy scout bagpipe bands. For religious travellers Christmas and Easter will be major draws, but prices are lower and accommodation easier to find at other times of year. Getting around the West Bank is pretty simple, on the informal but extensive shared taxi (or service taxi, pronounced &quot;serveece&quot;) network. The longest journey you&apos;re likely to face is between the administrative capital, Ramallah (with its cosmopolitan restaurants and nightclubs and official arts centres), and the northern city of Jenin.

Foreign visitors are still rare enough that shared taxis are a great way to meet local people; many Palestinians speak at least some English and are very happy to practise on you \u2013 a conversation that often ends in an invitation for sweet Arabic tea or a set of helpful phone numbers. Recent years have also seen new hotels, guesthouses, hostels and home-stay programmes opening across the West Bank. This makes it easier to stay in Palestine without being tied to the pilgrimage hotels of Ramallah and Bethlehem, and for visitors to make a real contribution to isolated rural economies. Granted, tourism to Palestine still faces many challenges, not least the Israeli border authorities who control all routes into the West Bank. For international travellers, crossing the checkpoints into the West Bank at Qalandia and Bethlehem is usually straightforward. Declaring your intention to visit the West Bank at Ben Gurion airport or the land crossing from Jordan will often, however, result in questioning which can last for hours. Travellers with stamps from countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Iran may well face long interrogations or a complete refusal from Israeli border controls. Gaza is another matter; the Foreign Office currently advises against all travel here, and visits require journalistic or diplomatic accreditation to go via Israel.

Photograph: Richard T Nowitz/Corbis    The impressive Hellenic watchtowers, ruined Samaritan palaces and crumbling Byzantine churches of Sebastia are a fairly well-known destination for whistle-stop Israeli tours. But a new community tourism project in the Palestinian village of Sebastia makes staying on in this picturesque region a delight. The elegant little Sebastia Guesthouse serves up breakfasts of fresh bread, olive oil, herbs and fruit sourced literally yards away; eat on a terrace with views over miles of olive groves or in the renovated rooms of Byzantine- and Mamluk-era homes. Young locals have been trained up as guides for hikes from the information centre to the Ottoman railway station or the ancient maqamat \u2013 Islamic shrines \u2013 that dot the surrounding hilltops. Both the information centre and guesthouse are located just on the edge of the village&apos;s main square. \u2022 Reach Sebastia by shared taxi from Nablus.

Photograph: Alamy    The great golden Dome of the Rock may be an internationally recognised symbol of Jerusalem, but actually getting into the &quot;Noble Sanctuary&quot;, Islam&apos;s third holiest site, can be a bit of an enterprise. The entrance for non-Muslims is tucked away behind the security gates for the Western Wall Plaza. Get there early in the morning, and be prepared to queue, because it&apos;s worth every second of the wait. As well as the soaring gold-and-blue Dome of the Rock (Qubbat as-Sakhra) and the sombre splendour of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the sanctuary complex houses many other smaller, but equally beautiful, structures. Especially worth looking out for is the Mamluk-era Sabil (drinking fountain) of Qait Bey, with its elegant carved stone dome, one of the few of its kind outside Egypt. \u2022 Official hours (though these are subject to change) are Sun to Thurs 7.30am\u201311am, 1.30pm\u20133pm.

His autobiographical account of growing up in this small village, north of Ramallah, evokes the brooding atmosphere of its old stone houses, grouped defensively around narrow passages and courtyards. Built for the most part in the 18th century, when the village was the base for one of the families who ruled over small parts of Ottoman Palestine, many of these homes still have wells for storing water, olive oil and grain to withstand sieges. Now, the local women&apos;s association offers a way into the village, running a small museum of rural bits and pieces, where they also serve splendid banquets of local food and give afternoon lessons in authentic Palestinian cookery. \u2022 Visit via service taxi or private car from Ramallah, or contact the women&apos;s association via the Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange (+972 2240 7611, pace.ps), traditional meals from \u00a35-\u00a310 Jenin&apos;s Old City     Olive harvest, Jenin.

But heard from the Cinema Jenin guesthouse in the city centre, in a cool, clear dawn, the haunting musical waves of the azan, or call to prayer, roll along Jenin&apos;s hills. It&apos;s a moment of calm beauty in this bustling town, sadly better known for the Israeli army&apos;s massive 2002 attack on the refugee camp. But in the ancient, dust-coloured Old City, staff at the Palestine Fair Trade Association&apos;s Al-Dabbeh Street offices in a stone Ottoman home explain the difference their fair trade olive oil make to the lives of thousands of farmers. Or Umm Imad, whose journalist son was shot dead by an Israeli soldier in 2002, smiles as she shows off piles of meticulous embroidery for sale in the courtyard of the Women&apos;s Cultural Society a few yards up the street. As well as making a living for local families, her society continues her son&apos;s mission to keep Palestinian culture alive. \u2022 Reach Jenin by shared taxi (1.5 hours) from Ramallah&apos;s central bus station.

Photograph: Alamy    As Guardian Travel reported last year, organised walking and cycling tours are an increasingly accessible way to see the Palestinian countryside and meet local families in small towns and villages such as al-Fara&apos;a and Aqraba, which are only just beginning to open up to international visitors. Bike Palestine&apos;s itineraries span the lush hills of the northern West Bank, the eerie Judaean Desert in the south and historical cities such as Jericho and Bethlehem. The Abraham Path and Nativity Trail treks, inspired by the wanderings of the Prophet Abraham and Jesus Christ respectively, are hiking trails through the northern and central West Bank which are open to walkers of all faiths or none. \u2022 A seven-day bike tour of the West Bank with Bike Palestine (+972 2274 8590, bikepalestine.com) costs $1,400, including meals, accommodation, guides, bike hire, transfers but excluding flights. A four-day hike along the Abraham Path with Walk Palestine (+972 2 274 8590, walkpalestine.com) costs $620, including accommodation, meals, guide and transfers, but excluding flights.

Nablus is home to two Ottoman hammams, which offer the traditional mixture of hot steam, cold water, locally made olive oil soap and bruisingly thorough massages. The 17th-century Hamman ash-Shifa is the best known; the staff are welcoming but if going it alone seems a little intimidating, some local volunteer organisations and hotels offer organised trips which, as well as the Turkish bath experience, include tea, sweets and shisha in the bath&apos;s luxurious, cushion-lined outer room. The ash-Shifa also occasionally hosts Arabic music concerts and even book readings during the PalFest literature festival. \u2022 Hammam Ash-Shifa (+972 9238 1176) is open 8am\u2013midnight Mon, Wed-Sat, 5pm\u2013midnight Tue, Sun for men, 8am-5pm Tue, Sun for women.

Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA    The picturesque hilltop village of Taybeh is home to perhaps the world&apos;s most unlikely Oktoberfest. Every autumn, the Taybeh Brewery \u2013 run by a local family who learned their brewing skills in Germany \u2013 hosts a bustling festival. Oompa bands and lederhosen are thin on the ground, replaced by the likes of Toot Ard (protest ska from the Golan Heights), political hip-hop groups from the refugee camps or troupes of traditional Palestinian dabka dancers. But the beer is excellent, and if the crowds are too much the ruins of the 5th century church of St George are close by, with spectacular views across the river into Jordan.  \u2022 Reach Taybeh by bus or shared taxi from central Ramallah.

Photograph: Corbis    The ancient, sleepy desert city of Jericho has a very different vibe from much of the rest of the West Bank. Summertime visitors will find that the residents turn semi-nocturnal to escape the heat, so at night the broad, flat roads fill up with silent cyclists. The &quot;garden restaurants&quot; along Ein As-Sultan Street, confined to indoor tables during the winter, spread out under the jasmine and bougainvillea for late, leisurely Arabic barbecues. Qasr Hisham \u2013 Hisham&apos;s Palace \u2013 is one of Jericho&apos;s most spectacular sights; intricate carved stonework gives an impression of the palace&apos;s glory before it was destroyed by an earthquake, and the famous Tree of Life mosaic shows off the skill of the 8th century Umayyad craftsmen. Plans for a new protective structure, to be built in 2013, mean that the palace&apos;s dramatic &quot;carpet mosaics&quot; may also go on permanent display, instead of having their sand coverings removed only on rare occasions. \u2022 Qasr Hisham, (+972 2232 2522) is open 8am-5pm Hebron&apos;s souk     The Women in Hebron shop    Just inside the main entrance to Hebron&apos;s ancient souk is a small, cramped shop, stuffed with beautifully-embroidered materials and with chequered scarves from the West Bank&apos;s only remaining keffiyeh factory, based just up the road. This is the HQ for Women in Hebron, an indomitable little co-operative that is one of the few surviving shops in the souk. Many have closed, shut by Israeli military order to protect the settlers who have occupied parts of the city, or because the settler threat makes business unviable. But with support from the nearby Hebron Rehabilitation Committee and small groups of travellers, a few survivors from what was once the main economic centre for the southern West Bank remain. On the benches across from the shop, you can sit with a falafel sandwich (done in oily, salty, delicious Hebron style with fried potatoes and aubergine) and drink tea with some of these remarkable women. \u2022 Women in Hebron, womeninhebron.com Akka     The Ottoman-era Khan el-Umdan in Akka. Photograph: Alamy    The new Bradt guide also covers areas of Israel that are home to large numbers of Palestinians and where their culture survives. Not to be missed is the old city of Akka (also spelled Acre), a small port on the Mediterranean which is one of the oldest inhabited sites in the world, was the capital of a Crusader kingdom, and whose fortifications put paid to Napoleon&apos;s Middle Eastern ambitions. It&apos;s a popular day trip with tourists to Israel, but it&apos;s worth staying to explore its Arabic heart, away from the &quot;official&quot; tourist complex near the main gate in the city walls. The sleepy port is home to the famous Abu Christo fish restaurant, which serves the fresh catch from the adjacent port. Just yards away are several of the city&apos;s imposing khans, huge caravanserais whose rows of stone arches housed Silk Road trains for whom this was the end of the journey. They are mostly half-derelict, and visitors are free to wander round; local fashion photographers looking for scenic settings and gangs of small boys playing football blithely ignore the warning signs under the crumbling walls. \u2022 From Jerusalem, the quickest route to Akka is by shared taxi and train via Tel Aviv, taking 2.5-3 hours if the connections are good.

I have tremendous respect for everything they have done. And Peter is more than just a chairman; he&apos;s a very good friend as well.&quot; Pulis, it should be pointed out, is not about to lose his job and, in any case, his close alliance with Coates ought to allow him to breathe more easily at a time when he is enduring his toughest period since he returned to the Britannia Stadium in 2006 for a second spell in charge. At least that is the theory. The reality is that Pulis has never taken anything for granted \u2013 &quot;complacency is such a disastrous word,&quot; he says at one point during the interview \u2013 and, in his eyes, the rapport that he enjoys with Coates and the chairman&apos;s son and daughter, John and Denise, who run Bet365, the family business that has pumped upwards of \u00a350m into Stoke, has only ever increased the load on his shoulders. &quot;John, Peter&apos;s son, is a football nut \u2013 they named their son Stan, after Stanley Matthews. When you have got that ingrained in the people that you are working with, it most possibly brings more pressure, because I am so desperate not to let them down as a family, because I know how hard they&apos;ve worked to put this club where it is,&quot; Pulis says. &quot;For that reason, it&apos;s a bigger burden than managing other clubs, because of the friendship that has been born over what we&apos;ve achieved over the five and a half years.&quot; During that time, Stoke have won promotion from the Championship, finished 12th, 11th and 13th in the Premier League, reached the first FA Cup final in their history and qualified for Europe for the first time in 37 years. Coates has described Pulis as &quot;Stoke&apos;s best ever manager&quot;, yet the Welshman knows that some fans want more. &quot;You can&apos;t manage the expectations,&quot; Pulis says. &quot;I think what you have to do at times is say: &apos;Have a look at what you had five and a half years ago and have a look at what you have got now.&apos; People like picking the roses but they never get time to smell them.&quot; Now would be a good time for some perspective. Stoke, on the face of it, are on the slide. They have lost their past four Premier League matches, conceding 14 goals in the process, and host Blackburn Rovers on Saturday desperate to find a remedy for the alarming slump that has provided them with an unwelcome reality check at a time when they are on the verge of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Europa League. It was not the scenario Stoke supporters envisaged after a summer of heavy investment that included a reported \u00a320m splurge on Peter Crouch, Wilson Palacios and Cameron Jerome on deadline day. &quot;It was \u00a318m,&quot; Pulis points out. &quot;and I think if you look at it, no disrespect, we have paid for five players [this summer] what Liverpool have paid for [Jordan] Henderson. We&apos;ve got [Matthew] Upson, [Jonathan] Woodgate, Jerome, Palacios and Crouch. They bought Henderson. We&apos;re in the same league. Or supposed to be.&quot; Although the last remark was delivered with a chuckle, Pulis would be the first to admit that there has been little to laugh about in recent weeks. He was furious after the 5-0 defeat against Bolton Wanderers, which he described as being &quot;in the bottom three or four performances in my eight and a half years at this football club&quot;, and any hopes that the players had got that result out of their system during the international break were extinguished when Stoke lost 3-2 at home to Queens Park Rangers last Saturday. City are looking vulnerable for the first time since a bad run around Christmas in the season after they won promotion to the Premier League in 2008. The Britannia Stadium has witnessed three successive defeats, Rory Delap&apos;s long throw-ins no longer seem to be causing such consternation, and the up-and-at-them approach that has served Stoke so well has been combated by opponents working every bit as hard, prompting doubts to surface about whether their gameplan is starting to unravel. Pulis, however, has a more simple explanation for the downturn in domestic results. He points to the demands of playing on Thursday nights in Europe, which he admits he underestimated, and abject defending as the principal reasons for their poor form. &quot;We&apos;ve gone through the goals that we&apos;ve conceded, and it&apos;s our own fault,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not teams ripping us to bits. [Luis] Su\u00e1rez scored a goal against us the other week, where he cut inside and nutmegged Shotts [Ryan Shotton], but apart from that you can&apos;t pick a goal that we couldn&apos;t have stopped. It has been individual mistakes that have cost us. &quot;I also think there&apos;s got to be more understanding from myself in respect of what we&apos;re trying to get out of the players. And after the Bolton game, maybe I&apos;ve looked at it with the view that to ask the players to play three games a week shouldn&apos;t be too much. But then when you speak to other managers who have got much more experience than me, and they tell you what they&apos;ve gone through, they&apos;ve all said that [Europe] takes a hell of a lot out of the lads, especially your first go at it, because it&apos;s so new.&quot; Pulis feels that Stoke have been particularly unfortunate with the amount of travelling. &quot;I saw an article with [Kenny] Dalglish the other day, where he is moaning about having to go down to London 48 hours before a game. Yet we&apos;d just been to Timbuktu and back,&quot; he adds. &quot;We&apos;ve played in Kiev, Split, Tel Aviv, we&apos;ve got to go to Turkey. I think we&apos;ve covered something like 15,000 miles and we&apos;ve played 22 games already.&quot; With another nine fixtures to come in December alone, Pulis says he is thinking of no more than &quot;staying in the Premier League again&quot;, especially as he is determined &quot;to give Europe our best shot&quot;. Trying to compete in both competitions has caused clubs problems in the past, and although Pulis has considerable strength in depth, he knows just how hard it can be to integrate new and higher-profile players into a club where success has been built on a team ethos. &quot;We&apos;re trying to get better individuals, players who are technically better, but still keep that DNA,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s what we&apos;re all about, so we want better players that will work as hard as the rest of the group and join in with the dressing room. That isn&apos;t easy. And if you find one that doesn&apos;t completely conform to what you want to do and doesn&apos;t join in, you move them on. And I&apos;m big enough and ugly enough to hold my hand up and say I&apos;ve made mistakes at times in that area.&quot; Pulis accepts that Stoke &quot;can&apos;t keep paying out the big fees&quot;, and for that reason there is a renewed effort to develop homegrown talent, which the manager has vowed to support despite his long-standing reservations about academies. &quot;I think the academy is a giving organisation. They give and give, and when you ask the kids to give something back it can be very difficult because you&apos;ve given them everything. I have my own views on it and Peter knows that, but I have promised Peter I will put my heart and soul into backing it.&quot; His more immediate focus is getting the first team back on track against Blackburn and trying to ensure that the club continues to move in an upward trajectory under his management. &quot;I think most probably that is my biggest challenge,&quot; Pulis says, &quot;because I think everybody accepts there&apos;s a level that you can go to, and I think getting to the FA Cup final last year and retaining Premier League status was absolutely amazing. Now people want you to do even\u00a0better.&quot; Every 90 minutes, Barclays Ticket Office is offering fans the chance to win free tickets to Barclays Premier League matches.

But a week after more than 200 protesters were arrested during a day of action that marked Occupy Wall Street&apos;s two-month anniversary, the question of how the movement became so vulnerable to an attack lingers. Protesters were initially portrayed as a nascent movement that objected to what they deemed to be unfair bank regulations, but as the weeks passed and the spotlight turned to the voices of the radicals and clashes with the police, the occupiers were ever more characterized as a purposeless group. A 16 November poll by Public Policy Polling  [pdf] showed support among voters was waning, too. Man Bartlett, an artist and part-time occupier from Bushwick, said it was only natural that the public lost interest and the conversation grew stale. &quot;Like with any new relationship, in the initial phase will be a lot of excitement and a lot of support. As the movement develops and continues to grow, that initial honeymoon period will be over,&quot; he said. &quot;Once the story wasn&apos;t &apos;What are the demands?&apos; the story became more about &apos;What are the internal struggles that the movement was having?&quot; Occupiers survived their first, temporary expulsion by the park&apos;s owner, Brookfield Properties, on 14 October, but issues larger than sanitation began to take precedence over the following weeks. Zuccotti Park had become a breeding ground for problems the protesters could have avoided without a physical location. The general assembly doubled in time but halved in efficiency and its consensus-based form of decision-making, led by a team of rotating facilitators who spoke loudly and used hand gestures to move through agendas, began drawing fewer occupiers.  A drifter could attend the open meeting and have as much say as an occupier in how thousands of dollars were spent. This ultimately led to the creation of the &quot;spokes council&quot;, essentially a smaller assembly that dealt primarily with finances and logistics. Other issues in the park, including a sexual assault and reported drug use, as well as infighting between some of the more than 80 working groups also flared. Alec Vincent, a 21-year-old occupier and culinary school dropout from Bay Ridge who made his living at Zuccotti as a shoe shiner, attributed the squabbling to the park&apos;s hippie-homeless vibe and a visible difference between occupiers&apos; backgrounds. &quot;Even though we&apos;re all on the same socioeconomic level, there&apos;s a class distinction,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m more afraid of an outbreak of violence within the park than from police.&quot; Eight hours before being ousted, Vincent said eviction wasn&apos;t likely but acknowledged that the emergence of a visible hierarchy had begun to elevate tensions between occupiers. &quot;There&apos;s always leaders. You can&apos;t not have leaders,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;re just not official.&quot; A member of the occupation&apos;s security team, Freddy Cepeda, of Bushwick, saw a leadership core materializing but thought eviction was inevitable because the park had become too unstable. &quot;There&apos;s people that were there for the right reasons and there were people that were there for the wrong reasons,&quot; said Cepeda, 26. &quot;It was just too much.&quot; At its peak, Occupy Wall Street raised more than $500,000 and drew 10,000 protestors for a demonstration in Times Square in mid-October. Thousands more took the streets in, among other cities, London, Berlin, Tel Aviv and Rome. But as winter has crept closer, the occupiers erected so many tents that it became difficult to walk through the one-block park. The protesters had outgrown a home they were never entitled to and the mayor wanted to act before the situation worsened. So less than two days after similar occupations in Portland and Oakland were dismantled and the press was largely barred from reporting the raids, he gave the orders to take Zuccotti. Bartlett, 30, called the move &quot;deeply problematic&quot; but wasn&apos;t shocked the eviction finally happened. For nearly two months, he watched the movement&apos;s initial concern of the bank bailout ramifications erode due to escalating problems within the park and the meaning of the &quot;We are the 99%&quot; becoming largely misunderstood. &quot;The problem is that not just that the disparity exists, but that the percentage of that one percent that is really exploiting the system and exploiting a huge percentage of the American public,&quot; said Bartlett, who was arrested during the Wall Street demonstrations last Thursday and later pleaded guilty to one count of disorderly conduct. &quot;And it&apos;s difficult to put that into a tagline.&quot; He added that the movement that began with a tweet from Adbusters had become more structured and self-regulated. Long gone are the days when one &quot;mic check&quot; would be echoed by all of Zuccotti Park and the nights when hundreds of occupiers attended a general assembly that took only one hour. The leaders that few would acknowledge even existed had enacted enough rules that the city within a city was slowly, and publicly, crumbling so that only Guy Fawkes masks and NYPD barricades would be left. From all this, it&apos;s clear that Occupy Wall Street is down but not out \u2013 at least not yet. The movement is sitting on nearly $450,000 and still has encampments in major cities and college campuses across the country. Occupiers lost their park, but they&apos;re staying in the public eye through coverage of how police officers treat the press and students, social media and smaller events, like the recent drum circle outside the mayor&apos;s residence. The occupation&apos;s immediate future in New York isn&apos;t set in stone. It&apos;s regrouping, analyzing the past two months and hashing out a next move. For one, protestors gathered Sunday night at another location, Duarte Square, and organizers announced both a new &quot;tenting&quot; initiative and a plan to eventually take the space. \u2022\u00a0This article was first posted on The Brooklyn Ink.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-25T19:44:00Z", "title": "Occupy Wall Street: how protesters made the Zuccotti Park eviction inevitable", "sentences": ["Thousands more took the streets in, among other cities, London, Berlin, Tel Aviv and Rome."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/nov/25/occupy-wall-street-eviction-inevitable"}, {"tags": ["Portsmouth", "Sepp Blatter", "Fifa", "Uefa", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "The fit and proper person test: how it works \u2022 2009: Vladimir Antonov&apos;s Lithuanian bank Snoras barred from opening a UK branch after supplying &quot;misleading information&quot; about its anti-fraud controls.

The protests in Wall Street, London and Oakland may be its flagships, but the Occupy movement is a global one, stretching across six continents, more than 60 countries, and sparking up to 2,600 demonstrations. There have been 10 camps in Britain\u00a0alone. It is hard to say who started it. Occupy Wall Street, which began in September, was the first to popularise the term. But #OWS was itself predated by camps in Madrid, Athens, Santiago \u2013 and even Malaysia. The day most Occupy camps got going \u2013 15 October \u2013 was first proposed because it marked the five-month anniversary of the Spanish occupation. What unites them? A common rage at economic and social injustice and the feeling that &quot;the 99%&quot; are being shafted by society&apos;s richest 1%. But each protest has been different. Some were no more than rallies, and their demands differed from protest to protest \u2013 if they existed at all. Many protesters propose tweaks to capitalism \u2013 a Robin Hood tax, perhaps. Others want wholesale systemic change. Often, anger has a local twist. At St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, occupiers have precise demands for the City of London. In Chile, they attacked university fees; in Spain, youth unemployment. In almost all cases, though, the camps themselves are a kind of\u00a0demand \u2013 and a solution: the stab at\u00a0an alternative society that at\u00a0least aims to operate without hierarchy, and with full, participatory democracy. PK Wall Street The US&apos;s first occupation was eventually cleared from its New York base in Zuccotti Park on 15 November, two days shy of its two-month anniversary. The camp had swelled to around 200 tents before being cleared, and tens of thousands showed their support by joining in protests two days later, attempting (unsuccessfully) to shut down Wall Street and marching (successfully) over Brooklyn Bridge. Occupy Wall Street events have continued since, with students from the City University of New York occupying a college, and a drum circle being set up outside Mayor Mike Bloomberg&apos;s Upper West Side apartment. Lawyers for the occupation have been given until 9 December to file a fresh lawsuit, which protesters hope could yet allow them to re-occupy Zuccotti. AG Vancouver The Vancouver-based group Adbusters was the first to suggest occupying Wall Street, and, fittingly, Vancouver is also home to the largest Occupy movement in Canada. Some 4,000 people joined a march on 15 October that turned into the occupation of the lawn of a Vancouver art gallery. Protesters were evicted on 18 November, moving to Robson Square, near the city&apos;s court, but were moved on 22 November, leaving the occupation without a camp for the first time in five weeks. A small group of 100 protesters occupied a construction site in central Vancouver on Tuesday in a &quot;non-GA backed action&quot;, but left after being ordered out by police and remain without a base. Occupy Vancouver is also involved in the west coast port shutdown. AG Portland The occupation was removed by police on\u00a013\u00a0November, but demonstrations in Portland have regularly attracted thousands of people. During demonstrations on 17 November, a protester was pepper-sprayed by police at point-blank range. The moment was captured on camera, and until events at UC Davis and Seattle \u2013 where 84-year-old Dorli Rainey was pepper-sprayed by police \u2013 was set to become one of the most striking images from the protests so far. Protesters are continuing to hold general assemblies in Portland, and gather each Sunday to plan new actions. Portland police have promised to limit their presence at rallies held by the group, in part due to a lack of manpower. AG     A tent belonging to a UC Davis protester makes its message plain. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    Oakland The occupation of Oakland&apos;s Frank H Ogawa Plaza has been the scene of the most violent clashes between police and protesters in north America. It first attracted widespread attention when former marine Scott Olsen was seriously injured as police cleared the camp on 25 October. Police have repeatedly used tear gas, rubber bullets and other non-lethal projectiles to suppress protests in Oakland, which have included a march that shut down the the city&apos;s port, costing millions of dollars in lost revenues and wages. The camp was finally shut down in a relatively peaceful operation by police on 14\u00a0November. Protesters are looking for new sites to occupy and are planning a &quot;co-ordinated West Coast port blockade&quot; for 12 December. AG UC, Davis Video footage from University of California, Davis, quickly spread around the world last week. A police officer is seen stepping over a line of seated, silent university students, before flamboyantly waving a pepper-spray canister aloft and then dousing each protester in an orange mist. The demonstrators were given this treatment on 19 November after refusing to dismantle their small camp, which had been erected the night before. Two protesters were hospitalised and have since been discharged, while UC Davis&apos;s police chief has since been suspended along with two officers. Seizing on\u00a0the increased interest the pepper-spray incident has garnered, Occupy UC Davis staged a student strike on Monday, in protest against tuition fees and the university&apos;s funding practices. AG Santiago Led by charismatic 23-year-old Camila Vallejo, 25,000 Chileans marched in solidarity with Occupy on 15 October. But their own occupations started much earlier: since May, students against university fees have occupied more than 200 high schools. Unlike their European counterparts, the Chileans see themselves as having clear demands \u2013 free higher education \u2013 and their actions are having a demonstrable effect on politicians. Last week, the government proposed raising education funding by hundreds of millions of dollars. Even these concessions might not be enough for the protesters, who plan to reoccupy their schools in March, the start of Chile&apos;s academic year, if their demands for free education are not met. PK Madrid and Barcelona Spain&apos;s indignados hit the streets as early as 15 May. Centred on Madrid&apos;s Puerta del Sol and Barcelona&apos;s Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, tens of thousands camped out in up to 30 cities, protesting, in some cases, for almost a month about the country&apos;s 43% youth unemployment rate. The success of the 15M movement, as it became known, prompted some indignados to call for a worldwide protest on 15 October, the date that sparked a wave of Occupy protests. In Madrid and Barcelona, hundreds of thousands gathered under the Occupy banner. No major occupations have since taken place, but many indignados are occupying empty buildings and sheltering families recently evicted from their homes. The day before Spain&apos;s general election last week, won by the conservative Popular party, a few hundred protesters gathered again in central Barcelona \u2013 but hardly any in Madrid. PK London Immediately evicted from their first target, the London Stock Exchange, Occupy London settled a few feet away on the steps of St\u00a0Paul&apos;s Cathedral. They were initially welcomed by the church hierarchy \u2013 but after a drop in cathedral revenue, the camp was asked to disband. This prompted the resignation of both Canon Giles Fraser, who supported the protesters, and the dean, who was felt to have mismanaged the situation. Criticised for harming the church more than the City, the occupiers then released a set of demands for financial and legal reform in the Corporation of London. Along the way, they expanded to a second site in Finsbury Square, and began squatting a building owned by financial services company UBS. PK Frankfurt Occupy camps have emerged across Germany \u2013 with more than 50 tents pitched outside Frankfurt&apos;s European Central Bank. There are two sites in Berlin alone, while 15 members of Occupy Hamburg recently disrupted a speech given in the city by the CEO of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann. In early November, nearly 10,000 marched in both Frankfurt and Berlin in support of Occupy. PK Rome Thousands of protesters gathered in Rome on\u00a015 October in what was the largest and most violent of the Occupy demonstrations in Europe that day. Riots broke out after a bomb went off, and an occupation \u2013 known locally as an accampata \u2013 later began outside a church in the centre of the city. The camp is still going \u2013 but recently relocated to the site of the ruined Roman Baths of Caracalla, a mile down the road. PK Tel Aviv On 15 October, 1,000 Israeli protesters held a dance party in an affluent Tel Aviv street. It\u00a0was called Occupy Rothschild Boulevard. But this was less Israel&apos;s answer to Occupy Wall Street and more the rebranding of a much larger campaign of civil disobedience that had mushroomed across Israel throughout the summer. From July onwards, two months before protests reached Wall Street, tent cities sprang up in protest at the rising cost of living \u2013 first on Rothschild Blvd, and then throughout 25 other towns and cities. In early September, 430,000 Israelis took to the streets in support, but by the end of the summer many had started to leave their tents.\u00a0Police evicted the last few campers in\u00a0early October. PK Kuala Lumpur Dozens of protesters have peripatetically occupied Dataran Merdeka, a square in Kuala Lumpur, since late July. Unlike many other occupations, Occupy Dataran is not a continuous occupation, but meets every Saturday night for a low-key &quot;general assembly&quot; \u2013 similar to those in London and New York \u2013 that lasts until the small hours. PK Hong Kong Sited underneath the HSBC bank, the 30-strong Occupy Hong Kong is not as large as many western camps but, unlike its counterparts, it\u00a0has avoided upsetting authority. By limiting their activity to music and low-key political discussion rather than more ambitious civil disobedience, the protesters have remained untouched by police. PK Melbourne A few thousand marched through Melbourne in October, and many stayed to occupy a square in the city&apos;s business district. The camp has since had numerous run-ins with police, with more than 100 occupiers arrested. They have been moved on twice, and the remnants are still fighting eviction from the city&apos;s Treasury Gardens, the camp&apos;s third significant staging post.

Next week, a little over four months after the untimely death of\u00a0the singer, Lioness: Hidden Treasures, will be released. By necessity, it is a collection of early recordings, out-takes, and just two unfinished tracks from her planned third album. &quot;She appears to have recorded almost nothing in the last two years of her life,&quot; noted Alexis Petridis, the Guardian&apos;s music critic, this week. Anyone who followed the tabloids over the last few years will be painfully aware of the reasons for that, but Remi hoped the album would be a fitting reminder of Winehouse&apos;s talent. &quot;Going through her music was like going through a photo album,&quot; he says. &quot;There was a lot of stuff that I had forgotten about, and that nobody else knew existed. When I shared that with her manager and her family, we thought maybe we should share this with the rest of the world.&quot; Will there be any more releases? &quot;That&apos;s her family&apos;s decision. If there was something later, it wouldn&apos;t be full-fledged the way this is.&quot; What does he think she would she have made of this album? &quot;She&apos;d be fine with it,&quot; he says. This work won&apos;t be the third album Winehouse would have released had she lived, but it will be a poignant reminder of what we have lost. There is, of course, a darker side to posthumous releases, where words such as &quot;legacy&quot; are bandied about and sales are guaranteed as long as there are enough voracious fans who can be relied on to will buy anything connected to their late idol. (In fairness to those behind Winehouse&apos;s album, a proportion of profits are to go to the foundation set up in her name). Tupac Shakur, the American rapper who was shot in 1996, has released more albums in death than he did in life, the richness of his music appearing more diluted with each one. Jimi Hendrix, who released just four albums before he died in 1970, has had his name on more than 50 posthumously, with most years seeing a new release of live recordings or a compilation, most recently in September. Michael Jackson&apos;s posthumous album, Michael, was released last year, 18 months after his death, amid accusations from the singer&apos;s family that he wasn&apos;t even singing on some of the tracks. Quincy Jones, his former producer, told Us magazine. &quot;It should have stayed in the vault. It seems everybody is trying to put everything out that they can with him. It&apos;s all to make money. He wouldn&apos;t have wanted it to come out this way.&quot; Another album, Immortal, has been released, and Howard Weitzman, who co-manages Jackson&apos;s estate, says more releases are planned. &quot;It&apos;s a pretty vibrant estate in the sense that it continues to generate not just catalogue opportunities, but plenty of other ideas,&quot; he told Billboard in October. &quot;Reissue, repackage,&quot; was how Morrissey described the &quot;sickening greed&quot; of record companies on the Smiths track Paint a Vulgar Picture, and there is no doubt that a celebrity&apos;s earning power doesn&apos;t stop with their death. In Forbes magazine&apos;s recent list of the top-earning dead celebrities, Jackson was at the top for the second year running, earning $170m this year (\u00a3110m; the previous year, he earned $275, or \u00a3175m). The man in second place \u2013 Elvis Presley \u2013 earned $55m (\u00a335m) last year. If you want to see how we might treat deceased stars in future, look to the US company Authentic Brands, which bought the rights to Marilyn Monroe this year (they already market products under Bob Marley&apos;s name). CEO Jamie Salter told a Canadian newspaper that, thanks to digital technology, he expects Monroe to be starring in a new film &quot;in the next couple of years&quot;. &quot;The entertainment industry is not renowned for its philanthropy or its taste. There is money to be made,&quot; says the pop historian and author Jon Savage. Record company balance sheets depend on their artists delivering an album, &quot;and if they suddenly die, then you want to get something out. But there is definitely a law of diminishing returns, and protection of legacy is actually really important for a star&apos;s longevity. You don&apos;t need dozens of half-arsed compilations on cheap labels, you need it done properly.&quot; It isn&apos;t just about the money, he says \u2013 there is often a genuine desire to provide something for fans, and a posthumous album can be a way to &quot;treat the music with the respect it deserves&quot;. Posthumous album releases go back to the 1950s, with Buddy Holly, says Savage. &quot;Holly had a No 1 hit after his death. It&apos;s kind of like the James Dean syndrome \u2013 if a star dies in his or her prime, it&apos;s a very romantic idea, it goes back to the &apos;live fast, die young&apos; ideal.&quot; The posthumous release, whether a film\u00a0or album, &quot;has been a staple of the 20th-century entertainment industry&quot;. The obvious problem is that many are a patchwork of unfinished songs, grainy demos and out-takes. &quot;The top musicians really work on what they do,&quot; says Savage. &quot;The attraction [for fans] is that the out-takes and stuff that wasn&apos;t released is new to them, even if it&apos;s old \u2013 but the problem is, out-takes are outtakes because they&apos;re not very good.&quot; Literary figures experience the same indignity when &quot;lost&quot; or unpublished works are printed. Last week, Penguin published Jack Kerouac&apos;s first novel, The Sea Is My Brother, describing it as &quot;a unique insight into the young Kerouac [he wrote it at 20] and the formation of his genius&quot;, but the reviews have not been kind. In this paper, Sarah Churchwell wrote, &quot;sadly it would take another 15 years and colossal amounts of Benzedrine for the genius to emerge; there&apos;s certainly none here.&quot; The Telegraph called it &quot;sketchy and clumsy&quot;. They wouldn&apos;t have been telling Kerouac anything he didn&apos;t know: years later, the writer who made his mark with On the Road is said to have noted of this first effort &quot;it&apos;s a crock [of shit] as literature&quot;. Unfinished, newly discovered works rarely reveal themselves to have been the writer&apos;s lost masterpiece, so the question is whether they might have been better left at the bottom of a suitcase, only to be opened occasionally by a researcher. In September, the British Library printed the first novel Arthur Conan Doyle wrote, The Narrative of John Smith, an unpublished work about a 50-year-old man who has to take to his bed with gout for a week. It is made up of conversations about science, art, religion and ideas with a selection of visitors. The title \u2013 and description \u2013 hardly conjures up the gripping nature of Conan Doyle&apos;s later work. It had gone missing in the post to the publishers, and although Conan Doyle later partially recreated it from memory, he never sent it off again. &quot;My shock at its disappearance,&quot; he is said to have joked, &quot;would be as nothing to my horror if it were suddenly to appear again \u2013 in print.&quot; Its editors admit that it &quot;is not successful fiction, but offers a remarkable insight into the thinking and views of a raw young writer&quot;. Fascinating to Conan Doyle scholars; less interesting to readers hoping for an exciting new novel along the lines of The\u00a0Adventure of the Speckled Band. For years, literary debate raged about whether Dmitri Nabokov should ignore his father&apos;s wishes that his unfinished work The Original of Laura should be burnt. &quot;Nabokov wanted it burnt, so burn it,&quot; the playwright Tom Stoppard told the Times in 2008. &quot;The argument about saving it for the &apos;greater good&apos; of the literary world is null \u2026 Our desire to possess [lost works] is just a neurosis, a completeness complex, as though we must have everything that&apos;s going and it&apos;s a tragedy if we don&apos;t.&quot; He called it &quot;an impossible desire for absoluteness&quot;. For decades, Vladimir Nabokov&apos;s son kept it in a Swiss bank vault, clearly torn between respecting his father&apos;s wishes and giving the world his final, if incomplete, work. When it was published in 2009 as a reproduction of the 138 index cards on which Nabokov had written, anybody harbouring fantasies that they were in possession of the writer&apos;s masterpiece were disappointed. &quot;Readers will wonder if the Lolita author is laughing or turning over in his grave,&quot; ran one of the first reviews in the US trade magazine Publishers Weekly. Martin Amis wrote, &quot;there is little in Laura that reverberates in the mind&quot;. &quot;It got a very mixed response,&quot; says John Sutherland, emeritus professor of English at University College London. &quot;[The book] is quite interesting, it&apos;s a bit like looking through the keyhole at the writer working, and there is a great curiosity. But I daresay quite a few writers now include in their will &apos;bury my hard drive with me&apos;.&quot; He acknowledges the excitement caused by the discovery of new work from a long-dead writer. &quot;We don&apos;t want to let go of great authors.&quot; The writer and literary critic DJ Taylor agrees. &quot;If you&apos;re a fan of a particular writer, you want to see every last fragment.&quot; Does it not diminish their body of work to release something they didn&apos;t think was worth putting out in their lifetime? &quot;It is so dependent on the individual circumstances. Take what the Beatles did in 1995, when they were making the Anthology series, and Yoko Ono gave McCartney unreleased vocals recorded by John Lennon.&quot; The songs \u2013 Free as a Bird and Real Love \u2013 the first original Beatles recordings for more than two decades, received much hype, but a mixed critical response. &quot;Certainly [those songs] added nothing to the achievements of John Lennon during his lifetime,&quot; says Taylor. Artists&apos; wishes, he says, are not sacrosanct. &quot;If you are a writer, and you have work you do not want attributed to you, destroy it. If you have a trunk full of stuff, including juvenilia that would make you blush, do something about it.&quot; If you don&apos;t, he adds, &quot;it&apos;s fair game&quot;. He points to Philip Larkin, whose secretary followed his wishes that his diaries be destroyed. &quot;Andrew Motion talked to her \u2013 she had burned them but had the occasional look \u2013 and they were the most ghastly, dreary, pornographic maunderings, but in some ways are we not entitled to know about them? If he had really wanted them to have been destroyed, why didn&apos;t he destroy them? These are such grey areas.&quot; These days, the death of an artist is rarely the end of the line. You can&apos;t feel anything but excitement at the knowledge that boxes in vaults in Zurich and Tel Aviv still contain unpublished Kafka works (the writer didn&apos;t publish anything in\u00a0his lifetime, but his executor Max Brod ignored his wishes to destroy his work; imagine if he hadn&apos;t). Over the last months, researchers at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester have been rediscovering works in the archive of the Clockwork Orange writer who died in 1993, including an opera about Leon Trotsky, a TV series about Attila the Hun and letters to Benny Hill. It goes to show that the long-departed can still surprise us\u00a0from beyond the grave.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-03T00:06:03Z", "title": "Posthumous pop: the stars who keep on selling", "sentences": ["You can&apos;t feel anything but excitement at the knowledge that boxes in vaults in Zurich and Tel Aviv still contain unpublished Kafka works (the writer didn&apos;t publish anything in\u00a0his lifetime, but his executor Max Brod ignored his wishes to destroy his work; imagine if he hadn&apos;t)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/03/posthumous-pop-amy-winehouse"}, {"tags": ["Society", "Technology", "Health policy", "Unemployment", "World news"], "article": "Gdynia, near Gdansk, does not compare to San Francisco or Shanghai as one of the great urban centres of ideas and invention. But last month it was giving both cities a good run for their money when it came to buzz and intellectual energy. This former fishing village in Poland, now a city of 250,000 people, was chosen to host the first international winter school in social innovation, which attracted 70 experts from all corners of the globe, including Korea, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Australia and the UK. All were seeking new, creative solutions to the increasingly serious social challenges of our times. Some were looking to solve problems relating to health; others were exercised by the problem of wealth (or rather the lack of it). Youth joblessness was a theme, as was ageing. No profit motive was attached or product pitch involved. This was just people offering ingenuity and services. The passion for social innovation is not new. But, as the success of the event in Gdynia demonstrated, an exponential rise in interest seems to be taking place, partly because of the impact of the internet and partly because government coffers are running empty and some of the bigger challenges appear intractable. Often, successful innovation means the addition of a new ingredient to what is already familiar. The arrival of television, for example, plus long-distance learning, created the Open University. Add cars to older people in need of a regular lunch, and meals on wheels is born. Hospices, charity shops, the Samaritans, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides are all examples of social innovation that eventually became part of the nation&apos;s furniture. The first three-day summer international school for social innovation was held in 2008 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque country. It was organised, among others, by the Young Foundation, Cisco and the Social Innovation Exchange, which allows social innovators around the world to exchange ideas. But Gdynia represented the movement&apos;s first foray into the winter months. In a former wartime Messerschmitt factory, now converted into an innovation centre, the group of 70 came together to assess what&apos;s coming round the corner in 2015 and how best we can all cope. The immediate impression was that coping would involve the use of a lot of Post-it notes. Jim Dator, an expert in futurology (who also acknowledges that almost everything foretold is bound to be wrong \u2013 rights for robots and paperless offices instantly come to mind) is fond of saying that, for any prediction to come true, it must first sound ridiculous. Hence, several years ago, when Gorka Espiau, one of the those in Gdynia, and his colleagues at DenokInn, the Basque Social Centre for Innovation in Bilbao, first began to collaborate with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a group of videogame designers on a low-cost folding electric car that opens from the front (so a wheelchair-user can roll in), is &quot;driven&quot; via a laptop by a motorist of any age and ability, and can store secrets about the way we behave (for instance, the vehicle can be programmed not to exceed 50mph), the plan probably sounded too daft for words. Several million euros later, Hiriko, meaning &quot;from the city&quot; in Basque, launches next month, in Berlin, Malm\u00f6, Barcelona, San Francisco and Quito in Ecuador (London missed out). Espiau says that the car is low-cost, around \u20ac12,000 and it will be rented out by the hour at a low rate, but whoever wants you parked in their forecourt \u2013 supermarket, cinema or optician \u2013 also foots the leasing charge. It will be small-scale in production, with factories sited in areas of high unemployment. So in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, according to Espiau, there is 90% unemployment among the largest population of Iraqis living outside their home country. Now a number of them will work on Hiriko. &quot;This isn&apos;t just about a car,&quot; says Espiau. &quot;This is about bringing together people from very different professions, architecture, videogames, the web, who are driven by the belief that the poorest can be mobile; even the long-term out-of-work can have jobs. Social innovation sometimes means nice people losing money. Hiriko will show we can make social change.&quot; Some of the original attendees of San Sebasti\u00e1n in 2008 were also at this first winter school. They were told by Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta, the organisation that promotes social innovation in the UK, that the challenges have not changed in the last four years, only their scale. In many parts of the world, people are living longer, but spending more of their final years in poorer health. Health and social care is eating into national budgets. So how, for instance, will new social media and different services and organisations help to ride to the rescue on a range of issues such as education? Femi Longe, based in Nigeria, tells us that 10 years ago the country had only 866,000 telephone lines. Now, in a population of 116 million, there are 88 million mobile subscribers \u2013 mostly young people. His newly established Co-Creation Hub, independent from government, is working on 16 different ventures. They include apps that will tell citizens about their constitutional rights (Your Rights in Your Pocket), apps to help students with study, and apps to encourage greater transparency and less corruption in the government&apos;s budget (BudgeIT). In Gdynia, we heard how a partnership between food companies Danone and Lubella, supermarket chain Biedrinka, and the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw had produced a breakfast porridge offering 25% of a child&apos;s daily vitamins and minerals, costing a few pence and cleverly marketed for &quot;supermums of all income groups&quot;. Since its launch in 2006, 50 million portions of Mleczny Start (Milky Start) have been sold, 27% to Poland&apos;s poorest families. Profit goes back into promotion. &quot;One bright idea doesn&apos;t solve the causes of infant malnutrition,&quot; said one of the team, &quot;but at least it gives a child a better start.&quot; Simon Tucker, chief executive of the Young Foundation, said: &quot;Social innovation is the only way to build a future we might actually want to live in. Even after the current financial crisis, challenges such as ageing populations and climate change mean we just cannot continue as we are with minor improvements. Social innovation is a more constructive response than protest, more active than trusting in technocrats \u2013 we are together taking responsibility for shaping our future and our children&apos;s future.&quot; Yvonne Roberts is a fellow of the Young Foundation Social innovation around the world Check You Out! UsCreates, a design company headed by Zoe Stanton and Mary Rose Cook, worked with the Prince&apos;s Trust, Empire Cinemas, Birmingham East and North primary care trust and 60 young people, including 30 selected as &quot;youth ambassadors&quot;, in Birmingham to devise a campaign to improve testing for chlamydia. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection in young people, affecting one in 12, and has no symptoms. At Gdynia, Mary Rose explained how the young people tackled the lack of knowledge and stigma. They came up with the slogan Check You Out!, used themselves as the &quot;face&quot; of the campaign; designed orange wrist bands, offered a free cinema screening with a health trainer in the lavatories who rewarded young people who took the urine test with free popcorn and a soft drink, which achieved a 100% testing rate. The young people also set up a Facebook page \u2013 Check You Out! It now has more than 5,000 followers; they entered a film-making competition and designed billboards and postcards using the ambassadors to push home the message that screening matters. The 12-month strategy has won several awards, including the Best of Health Awards 2010. Hello Sunday Morning In 2008, Craig Raine, aged 24, who lives in Brisbane, decided to say goodbye to his habitual Sunday morning hangover and try sobriety for a year. &quot;I wanted to know why I drank and what my motivation was to do it and what it would take to influence the way other people looked at [drinking]. Nobody thought I&apos;d last the 12 months,&quot; he said. Hello Sunday Morning was born. It consists of a website, to which people sign up and pledge not to drink for three months. They blog their progress. Research into behaviour change tells us a public pledge reinforces resolve. Raine resumed drinking after 12 months. &quot;It&apos;s part of life,&quot; he says, &quot;but Hello Sunday Morning is about when it becomes a problem, when you depend upon it psychologically to have certain experiences or fun.&quot; In 2010, the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, established the year before, selected Hello Sunday Morning as one of eight projects and schemes chosen from 258 ideas contributed from all over Australia, to fund and support. Hello Sunday Morning has been hugely popular, especially among younger people. The target this year is for it to reach 10,000 supporters and then become a worldwide movement towards a better drinking culture. &quot;I signed up to HSM,&quot; says Brenton Caffin, head of Centre for Social Innovation. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a problem with alcohol but I wanted to see if I could do it. It worked for me.&quot; The Kafka Brigade Originally established in the Netherlands in the 1990s, the Kafka Brigade now has a UK counterpart in Wales. Its aim is to reduce red tape and regulations and bureaucratic dysfunction. Frontline workers, the public, managers and policymakers are all required to take part, to analyse what&apos;s wrong and to come up with a solution. Some solutions are simple. For instance, in 2007 in Amsterdam, 37,000 people were leaving prison only to reoffend and be involved in petty crime, because of homelessness, delays in receiving benefits and unemployment. The Kafka project meant that prisoners begin applying for benefits before their release; are better supported to find jobs; and homeless ex-offenders are a target cohort for special housing support. The Kafka Brigade UK has also helped to reduce the numbers of young people not in employment education or training (Neets)in Cardiff and Swansea. In 2010, Swansea was recognised as showing one of the two most improved performances in Wales for supporting Neets. A review published this year described the Kafka Brigade contribution as &quot;a valuable process that helped clarify performance indicators, rationalised the action plan and led to individuals and organisations taking more responsibility for reducing the proportion of young people not in employment education or training&quot;. The Kafka Brigade is a partner with the thinktank Kennisland (Knowledgeland), headed by Chris Sigaloff. The Water Hackathon The Water Hackathon took place over two days in October simultaneously in Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala, Lima, London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv and Washington DC. Lack of adequate safe water and sanitation is the world&apos;s single largest cause of illness, responsible for more than two million deaths a year. As the global population grows, and demands on natural resources increase, the sustainable management of water is ever more urgent. Technologists, engineers, programmers, designers, water experts and people with ideas worked together over one weekend to come up with solutions. At the Co-creation Hub in Lagos, represented at the winter school in Gdynia by Femi Longe, a co-founder, 32 people worked together, as part of Random Hacks of Kindness. The group came up with a number of ideas, including mobile phone games to educate Nigerians on the use of water; a mobile system to name and shame companies whose packaging clogs the drainage system the most and a mobile tool to crowdsource (encourage the public to become citizen watchdogs) and track burst pipes and leakages across the system and get them fixed quickly . The challenge is turning ideas into concrete projects and scaling them up, but companies such as Microsoft and organisations like the World Bank are investing: they see new markets in the global population explosion.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-04T00:04:27Z", "title": "The fresh ideas that can help save our world", "sentences": ["The Water Hackathon The Water Hackathon took place over two days in October simultaneously in Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala, Lima, London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv and Washington DC."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/dec/04/health-unemployment"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East peace talks", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "The Israeli government has come under criticism from both the Obama administration and American Jewish communities over the past week \u2013 the latter focused on a bizarre advertisement campaign aimed at the US diaspora. The current Israeli government&apos;s insensitivity toward American Jews has gotten their attention, but whether forthcoming Knesset bills that are an affront to democratic values will cause similar alarm is yet to be seen. Hillary Clinton, America&apos;s top diplomat, said at this past weekend&apos;s Saban Forum in Washington that she is &quot;concerned over Israeli democracy&quot;, according to reports. Earlier in the week, prominent US communal organisations condemned a series of public-service announcements produced by the Israel&apos;s Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, which insinuated that Israeli citizens should not marry American Jews.  In one of the ads, a family split between the US and Israel shares a holiday rendezvous via Skype; when the Israeli grandparents ask their American granddaughter what holiday it is, she says that it&apos;s Christmas. &quot;They will remain Israelis; their children won&apos;t,&quot; the ad&apos;s narrator advises. The campaign has since been withdrawn, but it is just one example of bad taste.  More troubling is a forthcoming Knesset bill which would give the Israeli government new powers to regulate \u2013 or, more accurately, police \u2013 Israeli NGOs that receive foreign funding. The draft law would &quot;revoke the right to income tax exemption&quot; on such non-profits, and place a 45% tax rate on contributions from &quot;a foreign state entity&quot;, to Israeli organisations, among other parameters scarcely seen in liberal democracies. Secretary of State Clinton was said to have criticised this piece of legislation as a threat to Israel&apos;s democratic institutions at last weekend&apos;s closed forum. She also drew attention to restrictions on women singing in public, according to Israeli news outlets. As for gender segregation on Jerusalem buses, Clinton called it &quot;reminiscent of Rosa Parks&quot;. One Israeli headline described US Defense Secretary Panetta&apos;s remarks at the same forum as &quot;a slap on the face&quot; to Netanyahu. Panetta warned against Israel&apos;s military option with regards to the Iranian nuclear program and advised Tel Aviv to &quot;mend fences&quot; with Egypt and Turkey. Panetta said that taking risks for peace with the Palestinians is &quot;Israel&apos;s long-term security interest&quot;, despite the fact that talks between the two parties remain mired.  It is little surprise, perhaps, that a senior US official would be so forthcoming on security issues with Israel and the need to &quot;get to the damn table&quot;, as Panetta put it. &quot;The [Obama] administration has been making an ongoing strategic argument that Israel faces real, serious challenges,&quot; said Jeremy Ben-Ami, director of J Street, a group which has advocated that Washington take a bolder role in Middle East diplomacy.  Panetta&apos;s remarks do not indicate any sort of break; rather, they mesh with what former national security adviser Jim Jones and former Centcom commander General David Petraeus have said. That Clinton rebuked Israel&apos;s sequence of &quot;anti-democratic&quot; legislation, though, signals that Washington is taking note of the shrinking space for dissent in Israel. The past year has witnessed a variety of oppressive Knesset legislation, including laws targeting Israel&apos;s Palestinian-Arab minority and banning organised boycotts against the state. Last week, an egregious Defamation Prohibition Law was passed, which &quot;raise[s] the amount of punitive compensation for libel, without proof of actual damage&quot;, according to the Association for Civil Rights (ACRI) in Israel. If the NGO bill goes forward in Israel&apos;s parliament, watchdog groups like ACRI would be taxed at a punitive rate. In fact, a wide range of NGOs, today fully compliant with Israeli law, would suddenly come under an Orwellian regime. &quot;By focusing on individual flare-ups like the fuss over a minor ad campaign, the Israeli government is missing the bigger picture strategically,&quot; Ben-Ami told me. &quot;American Jewish support for and connection to Israel will continue to erode over time if Israel isn&apos;t fully committed to the core values that bind the Jewish people together.&quot; \u2022 Commenting on this article will remain open for 24 hours and may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2011-12-06T16:09:00Z", "title": "Israel's chilling relations with the US | Jonathan Guyer", "sentences": ["Panetta warned against Israel&apos;s military option with regards to the Iranian nuclear program and advised Tel Aviv to &quot;mend fences&quot; with Egypt and Turkey."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/06/israel-chilling-relations-us"}, {"tags": ["Republican presidential nomination 2012", "Israel", "US elections 2012", "US news", "US politics"], "article": "Republican presidential candidates made a prolonged pitch for the pro-Israel vote on Wednesday with calls for regime change in Iran and even hints at military action. Newt Gingrich, the leading Republican contender who holds a double digit lead in three of the first four states to hold nomination contests, backed his hawkish position by announcing that if he wins the election he wants his secretary of state to be John Bolton, the abrasive neoconservative and former ambassador to the UN who has derided Palestinian claims to a state as a &quot;ploy&quot;. Gingrich was speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) in Washington along with other presidential candidates, except Ron Paul who was barred for his views on Israel. Mitt Romney, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann joined Gingrich in stinging attacks on Barack Obama&apos;s Middle East policy, accusing him of weakness in the face of the Jewish state&apos;s enemies and failing to be sufficiently supportive of Israel. They also sided with Israel in demanding a much tougher stand against Iran over its nuclear programme. Gingrich said his aim would be to &quot;overtly sabotage (Iran) every day&quot;.  &quot;The only rational long-time policy is regime replacement,&quot; he said. Romney demanded &quot;crippling sanctions&quot; against Tehran and suggested the US could resort to force against the nuclear programme. &quot;Ultimately regime change is necessary. We should make it very clear we are developing and have developed military options,&quot; he said.  The calls were met enthusiastically by the Jewish coalition&apos;s audience but were also aimed at a wider consumption of strongly pro-Israel voters. The latest opinion poll shows Gingrich pulling further ahead of Romney in early races for the nomination, particularly the southern states of South Carolina and Florida. The CNN poll says that Gingrich has strong support among Tea Party followers and Christian evangelicals, groups that are strongly pro-Israel and far more significant in electoral terms than American Jewish voters who, in any case, lean more toward the Democratic party. The poll gives Gingrich 43% of the Republican vote in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote. Romney is a distant second at 20%. Gingrich also has a 23-point lead in Florida and is ahead of Romney by 13 points in Iowa. Only in New Hampshire does Romney lead among the first four states to vote, although the gap is shrinking with Romney at 35% to 26% for Gingrich. Paul is in third place in all four states. All six of the Republican candidates addressing the RJC attacked Obama&apos;s attitude toward Israel as disloyal and endangering its security. Gingrich slammed Obama for pressuring Israel on issues such as Jewish settlement construction in the occupied territories, which is a major obstacle to negotiations. &quot;This one side that says it&apos;s always Israel&apos;s fault no matter how bad the other side is has to stop,&quot; he said to enthusiastic applause. Gingrich called on Obama to reprimand his defence secretary, Leon Panetta, over implicit criticism of Israel last week. Panetta&apos;s bluntness came after a speech in Washington in which he was asked about what could be done by Israel to advance the peace process. He replied: &quot;Just get back to the damn table.&quot; The comments, which unusually in US politics put the emphasis for the stalemate on Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s government, have infuriated pro-Israel hawks who see anything but unflinching loyalty to the Jewish state as endangering its security. In a demonstration that he would run an administration far more sympathetic to the right wing Likud-led government in Israel, Gingrich said he would appoint Bolton in part to &quot;liberate the intelligence community&quot; to focus on covert operations, such as against Iran. Gingrich won sustained applause for saying that as president he would move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is not internationally recognised as Israel&apos;s capital. Romney launched a broad attack on Obama&apos;s foreign policy. &quot;Abroad, he&apos;s weakening America.&quot; he said. &quot;He seems to be more generous to our enemies than he is to our friends. That is the natural tendency of someone who is unsure of their own strength, or of America&apos;s rightful place as the leader of the world.&quot; He accused Obama of &quot;not finding time&quot; to visit the Jewish state, drawing some boos and hisses from the audience. Romney promised to make a trip to Jerusalem his first foreign visit as president. The Republican contender accused Obama of &quot;insulting&quot; the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and of &quot;emboldening Palestinian hardliners&quot;.&quot;President Obama has immeasurably set back the prospect of peace in the Middle East,&quot; Romney said. Perry attempted to put right the damage done last month when he said he would cut all foreign aid and let countries justify the need. Asked then if that would apply to Israel, he said yes. That brought a storm of protest from Israel&apos;s supporters who said that it would endanger the security of the Jewish state. On Wednesday, Perry tried to work his way around that by saying that he was referring to &quot;traditional&quot; aid \u2013 presumably economic and development \u2013 whereas Israel gets more than a $1bn a year in military assistance. &quot;Israel is our strategic ally. America long ago ended the traditional foreign aid to Israel. Strategic defensive aid to Israel is what we provide. Strategic aid in all forms under a Perry administration will increase to Israel,&quot; said Perry. But the Texas governor made another passing gaffe by referring to new Jewish housing in occupied East Jerusalem as &quot;settlements&quot;. Israel says they are &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;. Perry was criticising the Palestinian attempt to get UN recognition of a state with East Jerusalem as its capital. But the slip of the tongue in following the terminology used by the Palestinian and much of the international community will not have bolstered confidence in Perry among Israel&apos;s hardline supporters.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-07T23:10:24Z", "title": "Republican candidates appeal to pro-Israel vote at coalition forum", "sentences": ["Gingrich won sustained applause for saying that as president he would move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is not internationally recognised as Israel&apos;s capital."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/republican-jewish-coalition-candidates-forum"}, {"tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "European banks", "Business", "Credit crunch", "Market turmoil", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Banking", "World news"], "article": "A warning that Europe could fall back into a renewed credit crunch and serious doubts about the legal basis of last Friday&apos;s agreement on a &quot;fiscal compact&quot; for the eurozone could provoke fresh turbulence on markets this week. After initial surprise about the market reaction to the UK veto of the early hours of Friday, some EU officials fear the lack of certainty about the real scope of the new deal could severely unsettle them. This nervousness is heightened by continuing arguments over the scale and nature of any intervention to shore up the eurozone and resolve the sovereign debt crisis by both the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. &quot;We were quite surprised that the markets reacted as well as they did on Friday,&quot; EU officials said on Sunday. &quot;We thought they would really tank and there&apos;s still this legal uncertainty hanging over the deal. &quot;The one good thing is that there&apos;s a clear political signal about the governments&apos; commitment to budgetary discipline even if it&apos;s going to be hard to enforce without a full EU treaty behind it. And they&apos;ve only got two months to conclude it.&quot; Other senior officials said: &quot;This treaty they&apos;re planning might be quite limited to national debt brakes, reverse qualified majority voting on automatic sanctions and monthly summits. We may need a week or so to get legal clarity about the scope of all this.&quot; Concern is also mounting about the steps banks might take to bolster their financial positions to meet new requirements by the European Banking Authority (EBA). Last week the EBA increased its estimate, from \u20ac106bn to \u20ac115bn , for new capital banks would need to raise in order to withstand the eurozone crisis . On Sunday the head of the EBA told banks that cutting lending to small firms would not count towards meeting the tough new 9% capital ratio targets but could choke off the real economy. &quot;We might now have the problem that banks become too risk-averse. This might lead to a severe credit crunch,&quot; Andrea Enria told Der Spiegel. &quot;We will not allow any reduction in the supply of credit.&quot; There is already evidence that eurozone banks are growing ever more reliant on the ECB for funding. German banks alone need to raise \u20ac13.1bn (\u00a311.2bn) extra capital, with the country&apos;s second biggest lender, Commerzbank, widely expected to ask for a further bailout by Berlin. It needs to raise \u20ac5.3bn or almost twice as much as originally expected and is already 25% owned by the German state. Enria said: &quot;If banks cannot get funds, they stop lending and that damages the economy. We are stuck in a vicious circle and we have to try to break out of it.&quot; Italian banks, which need to raise \u20ac15bn, intend to oppose the EBA&apos;s ruling which, according to reports, the Italian Banking Association argues is &quot;wrong in its method and its conclusions, and does not take account of the specific factors affecting Italian banks&quot;. On Monday Olli Rehn, EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, is expected to renew his call for stricter fiscal discipline among all EU states when he launches the full-scale implementation of the so-called &quot;six-pack&quot; of new budgetary rules. Some officials believe this package is more meaningful than the outline inter-governmental fiscal compact endorsed by 23 EU countries at around 5am on Friday. It comes into effect this week and includes measures to enforce austerity among serial budget sinners. It gives the European commission (EC) and especially Rehn substantial new powers to intervene in the national budget process but stops short of those amounting to an effective veto for Brussels \u2013 and a huge intrusion into national sovereignty. Countries can be fined up to 0.2% of GDP for fraudulent statistics on deficits and debt and be forced to make an interest-bearing deposit (0.1% of GDP) if they fail to act on recommendations to remove &quot;excessive imbalances.&quot; This legislation and two new proposed financial regulations give clearly defined roles to the EC but this is far from clear in the new treaty Britain refused to join. Some EU lawyers have said that neither the commission nor the European court of justice \u2013 due to verify national &quot;debt brakes&quot; or &quot;golden rules&quot; \u2013 can be involved; others believe there are ways round this. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the commission president, is therefore expected to distance himself from the inter-governmental treaty when he presents his statement on last week&apos;s fractious summit to MEPs on Wednesday. Comments from leading players on Sunday underlined how far from settled the eurozone crisis is, with both the IMF chief economist and the head of the Bundesbank, Germany&apos;s central bank, saying Friday&apos;s deal is only a step in the right direction. Olivier Blanchard of the IMF said in Tel Aviv: &quot;What happened last week is important: it&apos;s part of the solution but it&apos;s not the solution.&quot; He blamed a lot of the market volatility on contradictory statements from EU leaders. Jens Weidmann, Bundesbank president, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that the new rules on budgetary discipline could not be watered down during their implementation. &quot;Without this any solution to the crisis will simply evaporate into thin air.&quot; The president of the Bundestag (Germany&apos;s speaker) said it would have to see whether last Friday&apos;s deal was compatible with the decrees of the country&apos;s constitutional court; the Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann called for a much bigger ECB role; an Irish minister said the deal did not go far enough and urged the ECB to act more like the US Federal Reserve. And Mario Monti, Italy&apos;s premier, said Germany would eventually have to accept eurobonds or common debt issuance.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-11T20:29:59Z", "title": "Markets prepare for turmoil over fears of new European credit crunch", "sentences": ["Olivier Blanchard of the IMF said in Tel Aviv: &quot;What happened last week is important: it&apos;s part of the solution but it&apos;s not the solution.&quot; He blamed a lot of the market volatility on contradictory statements from EU leaders."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/11/market-turmoil-euro-credit-crunch"}, {"tags": ["Europa League", "Champions League", "Manchester United", "Stoke City", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;People,&quot; Sir Alex Ferguson wrote in his Manchester United programme notes at the weekend, &quot;are starting to talk about the Europa League as a second class competition.&quot; Wonder who that could be then? Not the United manager himself, by any chance, when referring to his club&apos;s restyled European horizons as the penalty they must pay for being turfed out of the Champions League by Basel. Or United&apos;s captain, Patrice Evra, perchance, who said it was an embarrassment for the club to find themselves in the Europa League. United were so downbeat about the whole thing that even Michael Platini felt obliged to speak up for his little-loved tournament, warning English clubs not to get too big for their boots and lose sight of the European perspective. That message seemed to get through to Ferguson, who subtly altered his original stance over the course of the last week. &quot;It is a decent competition and the only way for us to prove ourselves is to go out and win it,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously we are stepping down, but if we go into it feeling we are too good for it and it&apos;s not worthy of us then we will come a cropper.&quot; There are, as others have been pointing out in the past few days, some good bits to the Europa League. Birmingham City are still in it, for instance, or at least they are at time of going to press. Spurs get the chance to play Shamrock Rovers, somebody somewhere always appears to be getting the chance to play Metalist Kharkiv, and even if you make it through the group stage, as Manchester City did last season, you can still find yourself plunging out of the competition in temperatures of six below zero in Kiev. The Champions League tends to be a known circuit these days; you may find the odd minnow such as Otelul Galati on the modern map of Europe but there are few uncharted waters where there may be dragons or whales. The Europa League is a bit of a throwback to when Europe was an adventure in every sense, with no guarantee that the outcome or the destination will be worthwhile or pretty. Yet most of those arguments reflect dissatisfaction with the Champions League more than admiration for the junior model. The trouble with the Europa League has always been that it was conceived to fit around the Champions League without distracting from Uefa&apos;s main glamour tournament, so obviously so that it is difficult to see it in any other light. It is unquestionably a second-class competition, for a start. You could say the old Uefa Cup was the same, except it wasn&apos;t. The original Uefa Cup was a respectable competition for all the very good clubs around Europe who didn&apos;t happen to win their leagues that year. The standard was frequently as high if not better than the European Cup, and quite often, with a few more teams from the stronger leagues knocking about, the path to the final would be more challenging. Best of all, the old Uefa competition stood on its own two feet. It would be won by a team that had featured in the first round because until the Champions League came along there was no need to parachute in group-stage rejects from the senior competition. And, needless to say, it was not played on Thursdays. Thursday is not a football day, being far too close to Saturday. Thursday football could have been conceived of only by people desperate to protect the sanctity of Champions League match nights at any cost, so as to raise maximum revenue from television companies and sponsors. Between them, the Champions League rejects and the Thursday nights mark out the Europa League as an inferior tournament. Not so much an afterthought or a consolation, like a plate competition for first-round losers, but something deliberately designed to be clumsy and unattractive. Given the choice, one feels the United manager and players would have elected to go straight out of Europe to try again next season following their defeat in Basel. Being scooped up by the Europa League was not what anyone really wanted, with the possible exception of the club accountants, and, though United are now making the right noises about being in it to win it and taking the competition seriously, one wonders whether this will actually translate to resolve and determination on the pitch. When Arsenal became one of the first teams to drop into the newly rejigged Uefa Cup in 1999-2000, they managed to reach the final, only to lose on penalties to Galatasaray because they could not seem to find the heart to take the game seriously. At the opposite extreme there are teams such as Stoke, thrilled and honoured to be in Europe at all and taking the Europa League commendably seriously, even though their fans could hardly have been delighted with a group stage schedule that featured away trips to Kiev, Tel Aviv and Istanbul. Since qualifying a couple of weeks ago with a home draw against Dynamo Kyiv, all Tony Pulis has been praying for is a shortish trip to Portugal or Spain so that fans can travel in numbers to join in the European experience. That is what European football should be about, yet even so it is a good thing Stoke have rediscovered their league form. Managers as varied as Martin O&apos;Neill and Gary Megson have decided to bale out of the Europa at around this stage in recent years, fearing with some justification that staying any longer on the Thursday-Sunday treadmill would damage their Premier League interests. So while it is always possible to talk up individual aspects of the Europa League, in its present form it is hard to love. It is not as good as it could or should be. As long as teams drop out of the Champions League and into the Europa&apos;s later stages it can only be regarded as an imperfect format, both by the teams doing the dropping down and the teams \u2013 Stoke or Fulham, say \u2013 who have battled thus far only to be dumped upon from a height. It is a cynical exercise in making more money and letting the bigger teams down gently, though as that seems to be Uefa&apos;s unofficial raison d&apos;\u00eatre don&apos;t expect it to change any time soon. What could change, and surely should, is the Thursday night routine. The Champions League is big enough to look after itself now, it does not have to demand all rival attractions operate on other nights of the week. One could imagine Manchester City v Manchester United in the Europa would divert attention from a few big Champions League nights, but how often it that going to happen? It is more likely to be Stoke v Schalke, and if Channel 5 wants to buy that and run it against ITV/Sky on a Champions League night on the grounds that it may be less predictable and more entertaining, it should be allowed to, because it may very well be. Stoke and Schalke are both playing in the Europa League on Wednesday night, which must make a pleasant change. They are doing that only because the Champions League has temporarily concluded, however. When it returns, it will be back to Thursday and Sundays. Yet between now and the end of the season, now the group stages have finished, there are going to be fewer Champions League games. Still the same number of match nights, but fewer games. It would be a start, and a much-needed boost to an ailing tournament, if the Europa League were to share post-Christmas Tuesdays and Wednesdays with the glamour clubs. Teams in the gruelling pre-Christmas group stages could then look forward to that as some sort of reward. At the moment, the trouble with Europa League football is that it doesn&apos;t look sufficiently like a reward for anything. As Mr Platini will realise, if he bothers to read the English papers, &quot;Thursday night, Channel 5&quot; has practically entered the English language as an insult. No competition needs that. Channel Five is bad enough.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-14T13:12:46Z", "title": "The Europa League would be easier to love if it weren't on Thursdays | Paul Wilson", "sentences": ["At the opposite extreme there are teams such as Stoke, thrilled and honoured to be in Europe at all and taking the Europa League commendably seriously, even though their fans could hardly have been delighted with a group stage schedule that featured away trips to Kiev, Tel Aviv and Istanbul."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/14/europa-league-thursdays-champions-league"}, {"tags": ["Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US military", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Iran", "UK news"], "article": "The idea that the Iraq war is over is attractive but deeply misleading.

RIP.&quot; But as Americans breathe a sigh of relief, the Iraqi reality is radically different. In Baghdad and Basra, in Ramadi and Mosul, and in Tehran, Riyadh, Damascus and Tel Aviv, unfinished business, much of it explosively dangerous and dating back to the era of Saddam Hussein, will come more sharply into focus as the clump-clump of retreating American boots fades away. The US withdrawal, while hugely welcome, is inherently destabilising. It is not an ending, any more than was imperial Britain&apos;s exit from its African colonies. Rather, it marks the beginning of, and a possible spark for, the next stage of struggle. Iran&apos;s rulers understand this historic truth very well. And their view matters since, as many regional analysts believe, it was Tehran, not Washington, that &quot;won&quot; the war in Iraq. Looming post-occupation flashpoints include endemic political division and economic weakness in Baghdad, the questionable capabilities of Iraq&apos;s rebuilt army and police forces amid ongoing security threats, the new Shia ascendancy and rising tensions with the previously dominant Sunnis, Kurdistan&apos;s de facto unilateral declaration of independence, intractable disputes over territory and oil and gas revenues, and the possible resurrection of al-Qaida in Mesopotamia. All these issues were created, or exacerbated, by George W Bush&apos;s decision to invade. And all continue to be ruthlessly exploited by Shia Iran, Iraq&apos;s historic enemy and now its daunting, over-bearing neighbour. Iran&apos;s tentacles extend into the heart of the Iraqi political establishment, starting with the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, once a sheltered exile on Iranian soil and an advocate of close fraternal ties. Iran&apos;s interests are faithfully represented in parliament by the Sadrist followers of the hardline Shia leader Moqtada al-Sadr, and on the streets by his Mahdi army militia. Iran is thought to run hundreds if not thousands of operatives inside Iraq, ranging from bone fide diplomats to spies and agents provocateurs. Its interest, the opposite of Washington&apos;s, is to keep Iraq weak, dependent and submissive. Its achievement, with a massive assist from the US, is to have eliminated Iraq as an obstacle or potential rival to its drive for regional superpower status. At a White House meeting with Obama this week, Maliki vowed to rebuild Iraq&apos;s sovereignty and signalled interest in continuing American arms sales and military-to-military collaboration. In comments apparently aimed at Iran, he said Iraq would pursue a foreign policy &quot;which does not intervene in the affairs of others and does not allow the others to intervene in its own affairs&quot;. But it was this same Maliki who, egged on by Tehran, torpedoed US plans to maintain military bases in Iraq after 2011. And it is Maliki who now leads a country whose 700,000-strong security forces are incapable, according to US assessments, of defending it against external foes, principally Iran but also Turkey and an increasingly unpredictable Syria. The Iraq war&apos;s unfinished business stretches way beyond its national boundaries. Its many disastrous miscalculations and negative consequences continue to reverberate around the world. The Bush administration&apos;s ill-founded insistence that Saddam colluded with al-Qaida, and even with the 9/11 attacks, seriously undermined whatever legitimacy the &quot;war on terror&quot; might have had. By creating a lawless Iraq, Bush allowed al-Qaida a foothold that Saddam had always denied it. Bogus US claims about Saddam&apos;s weapons of mass destruction have had a similarly chilling impact on counterproliferation efforts. When Washington denounces Iran&apos;s nuclear activities, its words are greeted with undeserved scepticism in many quarters. The Iraq war&apos;s undermining of the cause of human rights and universal justice has also had a lasting effect. The Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse smashed American credibility on this subject, at least for a time. It set a terrible double standard that has heartened anti-democrats everywhere, from Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin to Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad. The Iraq war continues, by proxy, in other theatres \u2013 for example, in the way the Sunni-led monarchies of the Gulf are consolidating their ties with Washington in opposition to what they see as a nascent Shia-dominated alliance embracing Iraq, Iran and Syria. The war continues for Turkey, too. Ankara refused in 2003 to allow US invasion troops to cross its territory. Since that watershed moment, Turkey has increasingly distanced itself from western and Israeli policy, notably on Iran and Palestine. Turkish forces regularly invade northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish militants. With the Americans gone, such confrontations may escalate. The $700bn Iraq war, coming in tandem with Afghanistan and the financial crisis, decisively tipped the balance of power and advantage from the US to China. It split the EU, creating divisions that have hardened into permanent positions, as seen in Germany&apos;s Iraq-style refusal to support Nato&apos;s Libya campaign. But most damagingly of all, perhaps, the war&apos;s acid legacy continues to corrode belief in western democracy. When Bush and his loquacious frontman, Tony Blair, made the case for the war, they repeatedly strained the truth, and sometimes lied outright. In betraying the public trust, they did incalculable harm to the western democratic tradition that is held up as a model for the rest of the world. This damage has not been repaired. Fault has not been fully admitted. Apologies have not been tendered. It&apos;s another reason why the Iraq war is not over and why, for generations living now, it possibly never will be.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-14T16:14:44Z", "title": "US withdrawal from Iraq is a beginning, not an ending | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["In Baghdad and Basra, in Ramadi and Mosul, and in Tehran, Riyadh, Damascus and Tel Aviv, unfinished business, much of it explosively dangerous and dating back to the era of Saddam Hussein, will come more sharply into focus as the clump-clump of retreating American boots fades away."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/14/us-withdrawal-iraq-beginning"}, {"tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "Euro", "European Union", "UK news", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "I don&apos;t know what I am talking about. And, quite frankly, you should be relieved that I know that I don&apos;t know. The world is full of people proclaiming about stuff they don&apos;t know much about. My\u00a0trade depends on it. Pundits, politicians and economists, too, all depend on some kind of bladder-busting meta-analysis to keep us quiet. In fact, they are just winging it. Too many nights I have watched economists on television being treated\u00a0with undeserved reverence. &quot;Economics is largely a made-up pseudo-science!&quot; I want to scream. After all, it has been almost entirely useless in predicting the mess we are in. Indeed, by coming up with grotesque calculations whereby rich people&apos;s investments were effectively risk-free and financed by the jobs and homes of the poor, many economists were cheerleaders pre-crisis. This is not another anti-bank rant. It\u00a0is now self-evident that banks did some bad stuff, but the diplomatic immunity they were granted was not merely political. Anyone who makes out that they know what they are doing and can turn a fast buck and believes, yes really believes, in something \u2013 anything, themselves even \u2013 is facilitated by society. And, yes, this is usually backed up by a narrative of questionable facts. What is valued is certainty. What is devalued in such a world is uncertainty. Those who aren&apos;t sure are weak. Poor. Faithless. Uncertainty is often worrying and feminised. Real men know real things. So they have been lining up to tell us that David Cameron&apos;s refusal to sign the EU treaty is the best thing ever to have happened, or the worst thing ever to have happened, when, actually, no one is quite sure. Reconciling a belief in the democratic process with the recognition that the euro is still in big trouble and\u00a0Greece may well go anyway, means it is impossible to line up clearly in the Eurosceptic versus Europhile shadow boxing. It is up in the air. As this year has been a news tsunami, it would be far more interesting to acknowledge what we did not know rather than what we did. Most experts did not predict the riots, the Arab spring, the extent of the economic meltdown. I recall meeting a learned professor in Tel Aviv three years ago who explained that Iran not Egypt was now the centre of the Arab world and everything would start there. Like many others, I\u00a0thought recession would produce some kind of resistance but had no idea how that would manifest itself. As for the financial crisis, our lack of foresight is mind-boggling. But in public, and especially in politics, an admission of uncertainty is\u00a0seen as problematic. At a dinner I\u00a0attended a few years ago, a young politician was asked a question to which he had no answer. He said: &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t know about that; I will go away\u00a0and find out.&quot; It was Ed Miliband as it happens, and I was impressed. But\u00a0the guys I was with crowed: &quot;We got him there!&quot; This relentless reduction of politics to point-scoring, this public-school obsession with certainty, is a turn-off. Look where it leads. Not so long ago, George W Bush said that if America &quot;shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift towards tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.&quot; Apart from war, this &quot;certainty&quot; helped to produce the debt crisis. It is certainty that we need to worry about, as extreme ideologies prosper in these uncertain times. Yet there have always been ways of thinking that properly refute certainty. The school of &quot;weak thought&quot; coming out of Italy via Gianni Vattimo follows a clear line from Nietzsche onwards that pushes against finality, and urges us to understand historical circumstance. &quot;There are no facts, only interpretations and this too is an interpretation,&quot; Vattimo has said. The work of Nassim Taleb also confronts us with the idea that the economic models used by the banks were based on the idea of stability. The ecology of the banking system could not predict risk properly at all (although Taleb did, actually). Then we have a genius such as Zygmunt Bauman, who has long been telling us that we\u00a0live in &quot;liquid modernity&quot;, that individuals can no longer plan careers and progress in linear, certain ways. Yes, it is like the weather: changeable. Of course those who most understand the value of uncertainty are scientists themselves. As the delightful Jon Butterworth wrote this week, science has nothing to fear from uncertainty. The sexy little Higgs Boson particle, which may have flashed up in the data in Cern (I imagine it as a burlesque sort of particle) has meant we have listened to physicists telling us very excitedly about how much we just don&apos;t know. This has been wonderful. The opposite of political discourse: to hear clever people talking about the limits of their own knowledge. How weighed down is public life with its emphasis on certainty. How dumbed down is belief. The big divides are not between different beliefs, but the differing degree of certitude in which those beliefs are held. No one knows. No one has the answers. Uncertainty is where we are. It is to be embraced. Christopher Hitchens, when asked which word he had most overused, said he was shocked to find on rereading his work that it was &quot;perhaps&quot;. I love that. Perhaps, right now, is the best word. I&apos;m sure of that. Perhaps.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-14T20:00:00Z", "title": "Why pretend we know everything?

What the manager got in the draw for the last 32 may have come as a pleasant surprise: the mighty Ajax Amsterdam, in a fixture that could comfortably have graced the first knockout round of the Champions League. It is an extremely tough tie and it is in keeping with the luck of England&apos;s Europa League representatives. Manchester City, who like United fell short in the Champions League to enter the competition via the back door, drew Porto, the holders. Stoke City, the only English\u00a0club to qualify through the group phase, were paired with Valencia. Ajax, Porto and Valencia are Champions League dropouts too. If the Ajax tie was among the best that United could have hoped for in logistical terms \u2013 not to mention it providing a fun away trip for their fans \u2013 it is also a confrontation that Ferguson will relish. There would also be no embarrassment if United were to lose. &quot;I have never played Ajax before in competitive football in my managerial career,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;They are a good\u00a0team and we are looking forward to it.&quot; If United are asking themselves how they came to be in the competition, Ajax need a dose of smelling salts. They had one\u00a0foot in the Champions League last 16, only to be overtaken on goal difference by Lyon when the French club scored six second-half goals to win 7-1 at Dinamo\u00a0Zagreb. The craziness of that scoreline felt in keeping with the soap opera that is Ajax at present. The club, who are fourth in the Eredivisie, have been beset by a boardroom power struggle. Roberto Mancini, the City manager, has stated his desire to win the Europa League together with the Premier League and the club have not felt the sense of shame that has accompanied United into the tournament. Their draw is even more mouthwatering. Porto, who are still kicking themselves for their failure to beat Zenit St Petersburg at home in the final round of Champions League group ties, are unbeaten at the top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga. &quot;Porto is probably the toughest game we\u00a0could have,&quot; Mancini said. &quot;Manchester City against Porto feels like a Champions League game. I have come up against them as a player before and also a manager, and they are a very strong club. They are used to playing in Europe, in a great stadium. &quot;Not too many years ago they won the Champions League. We know this game will be difficult, but also it will be difficult for them. We will be looking forward to it. It will be a hard match for us. When I looked at the teams we could face, I thought Porto would be the toughest. It is a good game for the fans, a big team coming to Manchester.&quot; Stoke succeeded in the Europa League group stage where Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham and Birmingham City failed, and they will go into their tie against Valencia, the third-best team in Spain, with tremendous credit. The matches will be their 11th and 12th in the competition this season. &quot;To be the only club in the country to qualify is a fantastic achievement,&quot; said their manager, Tony Pulis. &quot;I think it&apos;s been recognised that we had the hardest group and also we travelled further than anybody else as well [to play in Kiev, Tel Aviv and Istanbul].

But in reality Christmas operates as mass cognitive dissonance: the conflict between what we know Christmas is like and what it is meant to be. It makes us feel never quite good enough, however much we believe in the virgin birth or Argos. We fear our secrets might be revealed, and every family has a secret. That secret, as Alan Bennett once said, is that they are not like other familes. My family was not like other families when I was little, and it is not now. But Lord, I try. Because it is all about the little ones, isn&apos;t it? Mine, when small, were deeply conservative. Children are. They want everything to be as it is in the universal advert, the same as it ever was. But I don&apos;t. And, on occasion, I have made a run for it. It is not just the &quot;commercialisation&quot; that gets me, it is the pathological cheerleading of &quot;togetherness&quot; that makes me gag. Is Broken Britain to be held together with fairy lights and women driving themselves half-crazy with an inordinate variety of stuffing? Eating and drinking should be free and easy but it feels totalitarian. People\u00a0say: &quot;Oh you don&apos;t mean it! You\u00a0wouldn&apos;t want to be in a cheap hotel on a beach full of strangers. It wouldn&apos;t be the same.&quot; Which I think is precisely the point. But my quest not to do the same thing every year has traumatised my kids, and I have been reminded of it every year since &quot;The worst Christmas ever&quot;, when I took them to Bethlehem on Christmas Day. Yes, that Bethlehem. Call Childline. I found a cheap package deal to Israel \u2013 this was in the mid-90s \u2013\u00a0and we flew to Eilat. Deborah Orr came with us \u2013 she was always a fantastic friend and holiday companion. (For someone who has a stressful job, she totally relaxes when away. So much so,\u00a0that after a couple of weeks in India on another holiday, when she boarded the flight home in a bikini and a sarong, I was worried she might never wear clothes again.) Anyway, Eilat was a shopping centre, which the kids liked, but Deborah and I had decided we wanted to go to Jerusalem. Rather cleverly, I\u00a0thought, I booked us into a Franciscan monastery in the Old City, on the Via Dolorosa. Christmassy or what? My girls were moaning at having to leave the swimming pool. They were not entertained, as we were, by the road signs to Sodom and Gomorrah, on\u00a0the way there. To be fair to them, they were not\u00a0even that familiar with basic Christianity. That&apos;s the downside of a\u00a0multicultural religious education for you. My eldest maintained for a long time that Christ, like Mowgli, was a girl (long hair) and used to sweetly sing Away in a Manger: &quot;The little lord Jesus asleep in her nest.&quot; My other daughter used to have a strop every year because we did not observe Ramadan. They did not like the monastery (&quot;It&apos;s creepy Mum&quot;) or the monks (&quot;Why are they so quiet?&quot;). The floor was cold and the intensity of Jerusalem scary. There were pilgrims with actual crowns of thorns and guards at the Dome of the Rock worried that my 12-year-old was showing her ankles. It\u00a0was, I acknowledge, all very strange. But my pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was that\u00a0on Christmas Day we would go to Bethlehem where He was born. I would out-Christmas them. Though only about 10km away, it is in the West Bank, so involved several changes of transport and checkpoints. These were the days before the wall was built and if you were in the wrong car in the wrong place you could get stoned. But not in a good way. Manger Square back then was in no way &quot;Christmassy&quot;, though I was still maintaining that it was. There was a straggly tree, and giant posters of Yasser Arafat were everywhere. &quot;Is that Jesus, Mum? He looks different.&quot; The place where He was actually born was a\u00a0kind of cellar full of mad singing Korean nuns. There was nothing to buy even, just a sad portable building called The Christmas Tree Cafe. Christmas dinner ended up being some falafel next to some young Israeli conscripts with enormous guns, which were handled with frightening nonchalance. The fact that we kept saying this was where Christ was born &quot;for God&apos;s sake&quot; cut no ice. At least the next day Deborah&apos;s husband-to-be, Will Self, arrived, but unfortunately most of the presents he had brought for my children had been confiscated at Tel Aviv airport. Anyway, the journey back south was\u00a0stunning, though Deborah says both Will and I tried to drink the Dead\u00a0Sea because we saw signs saying not to. This sounds stupid enough to be plausible. Ever since then, my attempts to go away for Christmas have been met with reluctance \u2013 though we did manage to get to Cambodia a while back, as my 18-year-old was working there. Even then my youngest (yes, I have been allowed to have another child since, despite my Christmas shortcomings!) was\u00a0not keen on the &quot;compulsory Christmas gala&quot; in the hotel. At least I did not make them do The Killing Fields on Christmas Day. I have learnt my lesson.

In international affairs, at least, the year ahead looks like a miserable affair, likely to be characterised, in headline terms, by the three nos: no peace, no prosperity, and no progress. In conflict zones from the Middle East to Africa and Asia, there is scant prospect of relief in 2012 and good grounds for believing that worse is to come. Economically speaking, the monetary and sovereign debt crises affecting Europe and the US threaten to taint global markets further and trigger a general depression. In plain political terms, resurgent nationalism, self-serving or downright corrupt electoral processes, and a growing emphasis on the politics of fear and envy \u2013 contrasting sharply with Barack Obama&apos;s circa 2008 politics of hope \u2013 will ensure the lack of inspired global leadership evident in 2011 carries over into the coming year. That said, it&apos;s not all doom and gloom. We&apos;ll be looking out for some bright spots, too, that may enliven 2012. As the jaunty (and apocryphal) motto of Royal Nepal Airlines put it: &quot;When flying through the Himalayas, the aeroplane pilot should remember the old saying: every cloud has a solid lining.&quot; Electioneering The year 2012 will be remarkable for the fact that four out of the five permanent members of the UN security council (the US, Russia, China and France, with the exception of Britain) will conduct high-profile elections that will distract attention and curtail their engagement in international affairs. The prime example is the United States, where Obama will seek a second presidential term in November. Already he is cutting his foreign policy cloth to suit his political ambitions. His recent hyperbolic celebration of American &quot;success&quot; in Iraq, marking the fulfilment of his pledge to end the war and bring the troops home, was aimed directly at middle America voters. Never mind that Iraq&apos;s political tensions remain acute. A spate of bombings before Christmas raised fears of renewed sectarian conflict. Obama&apos;s 2012 campaign will probably lack the uplifting motifs of four years ago. He will concentrate on defending his record and portraying the Republicans as a dangerous threat. As matters stand, his most likely opponent is Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich, both seasoned machine politicians whose lack of new ideas is matched only by their lack of charisma. With the US economy in the tank and election-year unemployment at its highest for several decades, it&apos;s going to be close. Managed democracy   Elections (of a kind) are also due in China and Russia. Until recent mass street protests over fraudulent parliamentary polls disrupted the plan, Vladimir Putin was expected to be effortlessly enthroned as Russia&apos;s president in March. Putin is still odds-on to win \u2013 but the shine has gone off his particular red star. A third Putin presidency now presages a period of ever more chauvinistic nationalism and increased domestic confrontation. It is not yet a second Russian revolution \u2013 but it warrants careful attention. In Beijing, the Communist party&apos;s October conference, barring unexpected earthquakes, will appoint empty-space apparatchik Xi Jinping as general-secretary and prospective successor to chief empty-space, President Hu Jintao. Continuity will be the watchword. But China faces increasing internal, economy-related turbulence and a world market whose appetite for its exports has sharply contracted. Its new military-diplomatic assertiveness across the Asia-Pacific region is also producing a backlash among neighbours. Watch out for escalating territorial and resource disputes in the South and East China seas. French disconnection   Last but not least, the voluble, vituperative French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, will seek a second term in spring polls that pit him against the socialist-lite candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, and the far-right standard-bearer, Marine Le Pen. Sarkozy will run on a France-first, Gaullist style platform, abandoning his previous reformist message. He will be judged primarily on his handling of the eurozone crisis and its negative impact on the French economy and jobs. Cutting government spending, though seemingly unavoidable, remains a big taboo. Little big-man Sarkozy has already begun to externalise France&apos;s problems. Unsurprisingly, Britain is his chosen scapegoat. But tensions with Angela Merkel&apos;s &quot;charity begins at home&quot; Germany may build if euro woes deepen. Arab spring II  The Arab spring is just over one year old and everywhere the outcome of this unprecedented popular drive for democracy and self-determination, from Yemen and Algeria to Egypt and Libya, remains in doubt. Tunisia offers the only clear success story so far. The ongoing repression of the Syrian uprising represents the nadir. A key issue for 2012 is the survival, or not, of 2011&apos;s leading crimes against humanity contender, President Bashar al-Assad. His downfall could trigger momentous upheavals in Lebanon, where Syria&apos;s close ally Hezbollah dominates, in Palestine, where Hamas&apos;s grip on Gaza owes much to Syrian support, and in Iraq, where the Sunni minority might seek to emulate Syria&apos;s Sunnis in overturning the status quo. But the biggest impact of a successful Syrian revolution could be on the country&apos;s chief non-Arab ally, Iran. Assad&apos;s fall would be a big blow for the Tehran regime&apos;s regional ambitions and might even encourage Israel to use the opportunity to strike a blow at its main adversary. A senior US military official said recently that he woke up every morning worrying that Israel might attack Iran&apos;s suspect nuclear installations. The US, he said, was talking to Tel Aviv &quot;every day&quot; about the inadvisability of such an attack. But pressure to &quot;do something&quot; about Iran will build through 2012 and could become fatally entangled with US election politics. More war   2012 will see plenty of other actual or potential conflicts. Border and resource tensions affecting South Sudan, which gained independence from the North in 2011, have raised fears that the world&apos;s newest state could be throttled at birth. Post-election disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo are showing signs of degenerating into general violence. The sporadic murder perpetrated by Boko Haram across the Christian-Muslim faultline in Africa&apos;s most populous nation, Nigeria, shows no signs of abating. In east Asia, the death of Kim Jong-il in North Korea has introduced massive uncertainty amid doubts that the youthful, inexperienced &quot;Dear Successor&quot;, Kim Jong-un, is up to the job. In Burma, 2012 may determine whether recent progress towards more inclusive governance is permanent and substantive, or mere window-dressing designed to rehabilitate the regime. The long endgame in Afghanistan can be expected to continue to be bloody, unsatisfactory and confusing. American &quot;surge&quot; combat troops will begin to leave in 2012, and with Britain also accelerating its departure, a successful security handover to Afghan forces will become ever more crucial \u2013 and problematic. Chronic instability in Pakistan can also be expected to increase as long as the standoff with the US over counter-terrorism tactics continues and an Afghan peace settlement with the Taliban remains elusive. The fear in Pakistan is of another military takeover. A coup could bring an intensification and widening of the Af-Pak conflict. Money, money, money   In Europe 2011 will be remembered as the year when the euro dream became a nightmare, with Greece in effect in default and several other countries, including Italy, losing their leaders along with their credit ratings as financial panic spread. 2012 could turn out to be even worse as the 26 EU members (excluding Britain) who have agreed a new pact to regulate government budgets and debt fall out over the details. This outcome is not inevitable. But it looks highly likely on past form. Certainly the markets remain deeply unimpressed by EU salvage efforts to date, and major economies such as France could be next in the firing line. If so, that&apos;s the moment when the fabled Franco-German axis could break apart under the strain, spelling the end of the eurozone. Wild cards   2012 is a big one for Venezuela&apos;s president, the ailing firebrand Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who is expected to seek re-election. Likewise the ageing autocrat, President Robert Mugabe, could call early polls in Zimbabwe, heralding the now depressingly familiar scenario of rigging, violence and intimidation. A change in the top in Venezuela would have big implications for its tiny ally, the Castro brothers&apos; communist-Catholic Cuba, which will play host to the pope in one of the year&apos;s more curious events. The Fidel-Benedict show could make great viewing. As for the year&apos;s biggest environmental issue, climate change, the best that can safely be said is that, unimpeded by puny international negotiating efforts so far, the climate will continue to change.
