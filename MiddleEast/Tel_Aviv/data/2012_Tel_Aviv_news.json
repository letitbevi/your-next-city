Expecting the future to be slightly better than it ends up being. People tend to overestimate positive events \u2013 having a long-lasting relationship, or a certain salary, professional success \u2013 and underestimate the likelihood of negative events such as cancer, being in an accident, getting divorced. So it&apos;s this difference between your expectations and the outcome, where the former are slightly better than the latter. How did you stumble across it?  I was looking at whether the neural mechanisms involved in remembering the past are involved in imagining the future. My work on memory is mostly about traumatic negative events, so I was interested in imagining negative traumatic events, but had to compare that with people just imagining everyday boring events. But when I asked people to imagine boring events, they usually imagined some kind of magnificent scenario, which I found very surprising. Were you so surprised because you&apos;re actually a pessimist? You hadn&apos;t expected such surprising results. Not at all. And you might say I was optimistic because I was looking for something specific. It wasn&apos;t because I was or am a pessimist. But neither do I think people can classify themselves accurately as pessimistic or optimistic. How optimistic would you say you are? I don&apos;t think people can know their own level of optimism. The only way to do it is to be tested; I know all of these experiments so I can&apos;t test myself. My guess is I would probably be average. That&apos;s the best statistical guess you can always make, right? The average person is mildly optimistic; 80% of the population will be on the optimistic side. In some countries \u2013 for example, Britain \u2013it is more culturally acceptable to be pessimistic. In the US, being optimistic is considered a good thing, so I suspect people there would usually say they are optimistic; here, people might say not. But there is no actual difference. People who are pessimists actually seem to have a more realistic vision of the future, but this does them no good. In general, you have to have positive expectation to reach your goals. Does that mean Olympic athletes are victims of false cognitive biases? They can&apos;t all win gold, but they have to believe they can to propel them through years of training. I don&apos;t know if athletes are more optimistic \u2013 maybe because you can say that about many professions. Look at mine. People always think that their next paper will be the one that changes everything. But they can&apos;t all be. And I actually encourage my students to think like that because it could be true and it motivates them to do things. You give the example of the law students who are told there is a divorce rate of 50% but still believe their relationships will last for ever. Has it made you take a more realistic view of human relationships? Yes, I suspect I do. Does that mean you are less of a romantic than you were before?  Possibly. But it may be because I am\u00a0older. But in the book you say that being older doesn&apos;t necessarily make you wiser. That&apos;s true, though research shows that happiness goes down to middle age, then starts going back up. So when you get to your 70s and 80s, you seem to be in quite a good place. We are looking at the optimism bias across the lifespan. It seems like there is not much difference but there hasn&apos;t been a very good investigation. You talk about the introspection illusion. It seems that the harder you try to think about yourself, the less self-knowledge you seem to accrue.  It&apos;s not the harder you try, but that you end up attending to the wrong kind of things, not those that will matter. I give an example where people try to decide between two paintings to put on the wall. They try to think about which one will make them happier, but attend to elements which are not actually important for an emotional reaction. Why are we are so bad at predicting what will make us happy? First, because when we think about the future we rely on our memories \u2013 and they are biased as well. So we don&apos;t remember everything and don&apos;t remember everything accurately. Emotion changes how we remember things and that is really where I started my research, looking at memories from 9/11, which are vivid but not necessarily accurate. If you try to predict how you are going to feel on your next vacation, for example, what you remember from your previous vacations are the highlights so you don&apos;t remember all of the boring bits. Second, we focus on specific elements rather than look at the whole. So you think how you are going to feel when you are sitting on the beach but not how you are going to feel while getting there. You say that the financial crisis in 2008 is essentially a result of optimism bias. Yes. It&apos;s a simple example, where most people, from individuals to financial analysts to government officials, all thought that the market would go up and up and up and ignored evidence to the contrary. Research we have done lately shows that people take into account more about information that indicates things will be positive in the future. You studied at Tel Aviv University. Do you think that Israel is an example of a nation with an optimism bias? I definitely think Israelis are. I make the point that a lot of times in very difficult circumstances people are actually more optimistic. Such as in the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Depression in the 1930s, because in those instances you need it even more. And I think that&apos;s quite often true of Israel. You seem to say we are all engaged in making predictions, but the only people who seem to be any good at it are the ones who are a bit depressed. It&apos;s not they are good at it, just that their prediction is more like the outcome. So they&apos;re more accurate at it? They are more accurate at predicting, but also their prediction is affecting the outcome so there&apos;s a circular thing. Does this mean fortune favours the deluded? Definitely. It&apos;s not only when you predict the future, it&apos;s also when you think about yourself. Most people have a positive illusion about themselves. It doesn&apos;t mean we think we are extremely good-looking and intelligent, but we think we&apos;re a little bit more than what some objective measure would show. It&apos;s good that we have this bias. It keeps us happier. One of the most wonderful tricks you talk about is how we believe we&apos;ve always made the best choice. That&apos;s true. Depressed individuals don&apos;t do that, so they ruminate. One of the symptoms of depression is ruminating. People go back and say: &quot;Why did I do that? I could have done this&quot; rather than say: &quot;This was the best decision at the time&quot; and move on. It&apos;s the same with decisions. I often tell people who are having problems making a decision: &quot;You know, it doesn&apos;t matter what you choose. You&apos;re probably going to think it&apos;s the right decision.&quot; What are you researching next? We&apos;re looking at altering optimism using biological measures and ways to try and enhance or reduce it.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:05:15Z", "title": "The optimism bias: reasons to be cheerful", "sentences": ["You studied at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/01/tali-sharot-optimism-bias-interview"}, {"tags": ["Hofesh Shechter", "Ballet", "Dance", "Antony Gormley", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "From the outside, the contemporary dance world can look uninviting. A members-only club dedicated to \u00fcber-seriousness and having no fun. And, too often, as you take your place for the latest slice of po-faced conceptualism, that&apos;s what it looks like from the inside too. So when, shortly after the millennium, a whip-smart young Israeli choreographer started kicking down the walls enclosing the art form, there were cheers from insiders and outsiders alike. His name was Hofesh Shechter, and he had trained as a dancer in Jerusalem and as a percussionist in Tel Aviv and Paris. He had also done his statutory two years of national service, and when he arrived in Britain in 2002, he was one of the few dance practitioners who could strip down and reassemble an Uzi machine-pistol blindfolded. He was angry, he was darkly handsome, and he had a lot to tell the world \u2013 not\u00a0least that much contemporary dance was &quot;boring&quot;. Some of his peers would find him arrogant; most stood back wide-eyed, watching his rocketing ascent. To begin with, Shechter kept a comparatively low profile, performing as a dancer with his London-based compatriot, the choreographer Jasmin Vardimon. In 2003, he created Fragments, the first of a triptych of inventive, award-winning works set to his own compositions, which propelled him to the forefront of new British choreography. But it was the furiously charged Uprising (2006) that showed what he could really do. Drawing on his national service experiences, the piece showed a seven-strong squad of men hurling themselves through a series of militaristic rituals to a driving score. The work reflected the tension of life in Israel, where, Shechter says, &quot;there&apos;s a combative feeling in the air. It melts into everything. It&apos;s like an energy you&apos;re living inside.&quot; If his work was articulate, the choreographer himself was laconic. &quot;I&apos;m not the chatty type,&quot; he explains wryly. &quot;So if an immediate discussion such as &apos;what&apos;s for dinner?&apos; is off the table then I&apos;m a bit stuck.&quot; He has always been something of a loner, and because he works so much of the time finds it &quot;hard to maintain a linear relationship with people&quot;. He has a long-term girlfriend of whose privacy he is highly protective, and whom he needs &quot;slightly more than oxygen&quot;, but otherwise his closest relationships are with the members of his Brighton-based Hofesh Shechter Company. &quot;The dancers and I are friends, experimenting together. People are kind to each other. And I&apos;m there, sweating harder than any of them.&quot; Outside the studio, his greatest passion is tennis, a game in which he finds &quot;an amazing combination of instinct, calculation, tactics and mental\u00a0resilience&quot;. In 2007, after five hard months in the studio, Shechter&apos;s In Your Rooms broke over the UK dance scene like a tidal wave. The piece was unusual in that it was a joint commission by three London venues (the Place, Southbank Centre and Sadler&apos;s Wells), hence the title. There was the score, a thundering percussive assault, and there was the noir-ish choreography, with phalanxes of men and women match-flaring into view, bristling with existential fury, and fading back into darkness. Scene succeeded scene, each phosphorescent tableau overlaying the last, and the result was at once deathly and exultant. \u00a0This was contemporary dance as rock concert, a spectacle from\u00a0which you reeled into the night with your brain flayed and your ears singing, and when Shechter repeated the piece at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London\u00a0two years later before a jam-packed, beer-chugging audience, the barriers seemed to have dissolved altogether. Five years on, Shechter is an established luminary of the dance world, and his company, for whom he\u00a0has created two further works, The Art of Not Looking Back and Political Mother, has become a significant presence on the\u00a0international dance touring circuit.\u00a0At home, he has won a critics&apos; circle award (for best choreography, 2008), been nominated for two South Bank Show awards, choreographed plays for the Royal Court and the National Theatre, and created an opening sequence for the Channel 4 series Skins. Life in Britain, he says, is easier than in Israel where &quot;everything&apos;s a negotiation&quot;. Here, he says, you&apos;re given a choice. You don&apos;t have to fight your corner every minute of every day. &quot;You can engage, or you can walk away.&quot; Politicians, however, are much the same the world over. &quot;I feel sorry for them. Politics has arrived at a weird place, an inhuman place, where the natural instincts are not trusted any more, and some form of highly calculated language rules. In fact, the more complicated the words are, the more stupid the idea that they&apos;re hiding.&quot; Conversations with Shechter often return to the dichotomy between emotion and the &quot;mouse maze&quot; of language. Politicians and others, he says, &quot;are stuck in a horrible world where being emotional in any way counts as being unbalanced, and unable\u00a0to think clearly. For me, emotions are thought.&quot; As well as being formed &quot;mentally, physically and emotionally&quot; by the process of growing up in Israel, Shechter saw his parents &quot;getting divorced, remarrying someone else, divorcing, remarrying someone else, and so on\u2026&quot; The strain of this &quot;family complexity&quot; is evident in The Art of Not Looking Back, created for the six female\u00a0dancers of his company. &quot;My mother left me when I was two years old,&quot; Shechter announces on the soundtrack, as the performers writhe and clutch themselves. &quot;It&apos;s like having a bucket with a hole. No matter what you pour in, it&apos;s always empty.&quot; An unflinching spectator of his own pain, Shechter uses dance to twist it into something feral and even beautiful. Typically, however, he denies us a redemptive ending. &quot;I don&apos;t forgive you,&quot; he concludes flatly, as the lights fade to blackout. His latest venture is Survivor, a collaboration with the sculptor Antony Gormley. Here, for the first time, Shechter&apos;s musical composition will take precedence over his choreography. The project, which will see five &quot;living sculptures&quot;, a 30-strong band and an army of a hundred drummers sharing the Barbican stage, is colossal in scale, and when I meet Shechter at Gormley&apos;s north London studio, he tells me that the piece&apos;s themes are those which have long preoccupied him. &quot;Man against the world, that&apos;s the story. From the moment you&apos;re born, you&apos;re asking yourself: what&apos;s my place in this? I look at our helplessness before nature, before the cosmos\u2026&quot; Shechter smiles. He seems exasperated by human nature, not least his own, speaking of &quot;the fight between the thinking mind and the bubbling beneath; the way we&apos;re ruled by needs and urges&quot;. Shechter&apos;s work succeeds because it bypasses the cerebral, analytical place where most contemporary dance\u00a0finds a lodging, and strikes directly at our buried fears and longings. What he shows us is the void, against which human activity appears by turns ludicrous, frantic and sad. Although his choreography is electrifying in its beauty and originality of craft, creation does not come easily to him. &quot;I walk into the rehearsal studio and I think everything I&apos;ve done to date is shit. There are cycles of hope and loss of hope. Cycles of belief and loss of belief. There&apos;s despair.&quot; But in working with Gormley, whom he met when the sculptor came to the Roundhouse show in 2009, Shechter seems to have found a kind of peace. To begin with, he was apprehensive. &quot;I\u00a0was worried we&apos;d get into arguments, because we&apos;re in a different place regarding anger and acceptance. But actually, I feel free. We&apos;ve been dreaming together, and I&apos;ve discovered that Antony also has a place with anger in it.&quot; The sculptor&apos;s work, he says, operates silently. &quot;It&apos;s about finding a place for a single body. A body in front of the world, at once inside and outside. There&apos;s a kind of helplessness\u00a0in that. A sense of &apos;that&apos;s the way it is&apos;, which is very beautiful and sad. It&apos;s a feeling of being\u00a0overwhelmed. A feeling of instability. A sense that everything can be taken away.&quot; Listening to his words, I have the impression that Gormley has brought\u00a0Shechter in from the cold, quietly redirecting his attention from his own psychic pain to a contemplation of the sublime. In creating the score for Survivor, Shechter is negotiating territory in which dread cohabits with a consoling\u00a0beauty. A 40-metre onstage screen will show footage of &quot;the forces\u00a0that surround us. Forces which bring great fear, and bring great hope\u2026 I&apos;m discovering the pastoral; it&apos;s a powerful, ancient feeling.&quot; Whatever the outcome of this collaboration, Survivor will be nothing if not grand scale. At an early stage of the project, Gormley spoke of the adventure of working with &quot;the emergent architecture of Hofesh&apos;s pulmonary music&quot;, which is perhaps another way\u00a0of saying that it&apos;s going to be a very loud gig indeed.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-08T00:05:00Z", "title": "Hofesh Shechter: his dark materials", "sentences": ["His name was Hofesh Shechter, and he had trained as a dancer in Jerusalem and as a percussionist in Tel Aviv and Paris."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/08/hofesh-shechter-choreographer-survivor-gormley"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Politics", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "World news", "Hisham Matar"], "article": "Tamim Al-Barghouti     Photograph: \u00a9 Nasser Nuri/Reuters    In the piece I wrote for the Guardian, published on 27 January 2011, only two days after the outbreak of the Egyptian revolution, I said: &quot;Now the wave is coming. I will venture to say that the Egyptian regime has already fallen: it might take some time, but the fear, the perception that the regime is invincible has gone once and for all.&quot; I also said: &quot;Revolutions travel, and in the\u00a0Arab world they travel faster [\u2026] Tunisia sent out the message that client regimes fall \u2013 that if we can drive the empires out, we will surely be able to drive out their vassals.&quot; Both predictions came true \u2013 Mubarak&apos;s regime fell, and revolutions spread across the Arab world. But I also made a third prediction. I said: &quot;Cairo knows and Cairo moves. Ramallah worries that an empowered Cairo means an empowered Gaza, and Tel Aviv and Washington know that instead of just Iran, they will now have to worry about Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Palestine all at once.&quot; This one has not yet come true \u2013 my argument here is that it will. In Egypt, power went from Mubarak to his generals. But they are incompetent and weak. Seeing how their commander-in-chief was abandoned by his old allies, they have little faith in US support. They also know they can&apos;t shoot at large crowds. The generals do order their troops to shoot, but only at small demonstrations. When, in retaliation for such killings, the squares fill up, the generals back down and offer concessions. Such concessions are usually not enough, which results in another round of small demonstrations, killings, million-man marches, and then concessions again. Despite the casualties, Tahrir Square has been ruling Egypt almost as much as the generals over the past year. If Egypt is bound eventually to break away from the grip of the military, the US will have lost a strategic ally that it can only compensate by establishing a friendly regime in Syria. But US support for the Syrian opposition is more harmful than useful, as it allows the Damascus regime to portray the opposition as an American pawn. This, coupled with fear of a sectarian civil war between Sunnis and Alawites, is keeping people in Damascus and Aleppo at home. In addition, even to the Egyptian Muslim Brothers, who are most sympathetic to the Syrian opposition, a civil war in Syria, or a pro-American regime that would relive Israel from Hezbollah&apos;s pressure to the north, is a direct threat to Cairo&apos;s national interests. A free Cairo will maintain an anti-Israeli Damascus. If the Syrian foreign alliances are maintained, an Egyptian-Syrian-Lebanese, Turkish-Iranian-Iraqi alliance in the Middle East will emerge that is strong enough to counter, and even threaten, American influence in the region and dictate the outcome of any settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. In short, the entire region will achieve independence. It might take some time, maybe years, but freedom from colonialism and neocolonialism is inevitable. Tamim Al-Barghouti is a Palestinian poet.

Hisham Matar        Photograph: Murdo Macleod    My generation of Libyans was born into a state of waiting. We spent decades hoping for a miracle. We were surrounded by fairytales, stories about how a knight would come riding over the hill and fix everything. We peddled all sorts of conspiracy theories except the one that silenced us most, the one that said we were helpless. Few of us could remember a time before this waiting. Even fewer could imagine a life beyond it. Therefore, our problem was chiefly one of the imagination. We could not picture how to live in action rather than in hope. That was the shape of our horizon. And we were almost resigned to it. Even our hopes seemed unconvincing. We indulged in them nonetheless, whenever we felt safe to do so; our living rooms and dining tables witnessed many heated discussions. But the silence of our solitude said it all. It seemed we were caught between quiet defeatism and sentimental expressions of our yearnings. We existed in the theoretical space between the wretched political reality of our days and our implausible aspirations. We waited. Whenever someone asked, as does Vladimir in Waiting for Godot, &quot;What do we do now?&quot; the answer was as prompt and horrific as Estragon&apos;s: &quot;Wait.&quot; &quot;Yes, but while waiting,&quot; Vladimir goes on. &quot;What about hanging ourselves?&quot; Estragon suggests. For us too the choice seemed as stark and darkly comical; for, yes, we knew how to laugh at ourselves \u2013 and, contrary to popular myth, that did not make it any better. But then suddenly and unexpectedly a miracle happened. It was not, thank goodness, heralded by a knight but by mass awakening: a chorus so vivid and colourful and true that it is not inappropriate to liken it to spring. It returned us from self-loathing and despair. The shift in our psychology is fundamental. The place we now find ourselves in is like a state of remembering, as if a fog has lifted and revealed a new but somehow familiar landscape. We are learning to speak in practical terms. We have a new passion for detail. We are hopeful but are no longer living in hope. We are anxious but not afraid. We no longer look over our shoulder. The road ahead needs all of our attention. We carry with us those who are reluctant, and those who perpetrated unspeakable crimes. We need to find a way to secure justice clean of revenge. We have all seen too much blood. No one can erase the images from our memory. Perhaps that is not a bad thing, for we must remain true to the fallen and their sacrifice. The silence of our solitude now no longer speaks of defeatism; instead, it is filled with the echoes of war. We are yet to count our dead or account for the disappeared. But the best thing about time is its length, as my father used to say. At this fleeting moment of our history at least, time seems to be on our side. And, finally, we are joyful. Hisham Matar was born in New York to Libyan parents. His debut novel, In the Country of Men, shortlisted for the 2006 Booker prize, was followed by Anatomy of a Disappearance in 2011.    Laila Lalami      Laila Lalami    What I will always treasure about 2011 is the taste of freedom. Having grown up in a dictatorship, I relished the sight of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali squirming in his seat last January, clearly at a loss for words, unsure what he should do to stem the tide of change in Tunisia. I knew right away that the Tunisian revolution would inspire democracy activists in north Africa and the Middle East. In my country, Morocco, it led to the birth of the February 20 Movement, a coalition of young activists of diverse and even divergent political convictions, but who share the same goal: turning Morocco into a parliamentary monarchy, where the king reigns but does not govern. Almost immediately, the regime pushed back against the movement by calling its members atheists, separatists, Islamists, agents provocateurs funded by the west, and other sobriquets designed to isolate them from the mainstream. But on 20 February, co-ordinated marches took place in 57 cities and towns throughout the kingdom. They were well organised and well attended, and represented enough of a threat that on 9 March, only 17 days later, King Mohammad announced that he planned to reform the constitution. I couldn&apos;t help but notice that the Mennouni commission, which was set up to draft the new constitution, was appointed directly by the king, and accountable only to him. How could a fundamentally non-democratic entity deliver democratic change? Yet the king&apos;s announcement immediately garnered him wide praise in the west, particularly in France and the United States, with the result that world media attention shifted to bloodier and more chaotic uprisings elsewhere in north Africa. They made for better television. While Morocco&apos;s new constitution recognises the language of the indigenous Amazigh people as an official language, and while it gives the winning party in legislative elections the right to form a government, it does not limit the powers of the monarch. The king can still dissolve parliament at will; he chooses all provincial governors and the heads of national companies; and he is still the decider in military and religious affairs. In addition, his person is considered &quot;inviolable&quot;, a stipulation that stifles any criticism of him or his policies. The new constitution isn&apos;t so much a step toward democracy as a slight shift from autocracy to lighter autocracy. In November, legislative elections brought an Islamist party, the pro-royalist Party of Justice and Development, to power. The success of the PJD in the elections was no doubt due to the fact that it was untested, and therefore untainted by the corruption for which parties already in power were notorious. In accordance with the new constitution, the PJD&apos;s leader Abdelilah Benkiarne, was named prime minister and was charged with forming a government. However, three recent developments cast doubt on the ability of the regime to reform. In early December, the king appointed Fouad Ali el-Himma, the b\u00eate noire of the February 20 movement, to the post of royal adviser. Himma is a former classmate of the king who, over the years, has risen to become one of the most powerful and least popular political figures in the country. This is a clear signal that the opinions of democracy activists and Moroccan voters alike do not count. (Himma&apos;s party had a poor showing in the elections.) Also in December, the king named 28 new ambassadors without consulting the prime minister or the cabinet, as would have been required by the constitution. In January, he finally appointed the new cabinet, chosen by Benkirane, but forced several of his close allies into key ministries. The past year has made patently clear that no Arab regime will reform unless it is pressured to do so by the people and unless that pressure is maintained. In the case of Morocco, the new constitution, however imperfect, would not have been possible without the February 20 movement. And the movement, however well intentioned it is, has failed to put sufficient pressure on the regime. Still, it cannot be written off. As I write, democracy marches are still being held every week in Morocco and their slogans now include something no one would have dared say a year ago in this monarchy: &quot;Long live the people.&quot; Laila Lalami, is a Moroccan-born writer and critic, and associate professor at the University of California, Riverside.   Alaa Abd El Fattah     Alaa Abd El Fatah     I think we were all surprised at the speed with which Hosni Mubarak fell. We defeated the security establishment in one day, the thug militias in another, and found that the ruling National Democratic party was made of straw. In a way, the battle we&apos;re engaged in now is the battle we would have expected to fight against Mubarak; but we&apos;re fighting it against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf). And it&apos;s also surprising that Scaf should have revealed its true face so early. It would have made more sense for its members \u2013 since they presented themselves as protectors of the revolution \u2013 to allow at least some reforms. We expected them to keep hold of foreign affairs and the whole varied security system \u2013 as well as military affairs of course \u2013 but allow reforms and so invest in the popularity of the military as an institution. This would have allowed them to remain kingmakers and to intervene in the economy at critical moments to protect their interests. We thought they would basically try to quietly protect the interests of the US and Israel and keep their influence on politics and the economy but drop the more flagrant manifestations of the regime \u2013 the manifestations that had angered people so much. And frankly, we thought it would be very difficult for us to expose this and deal with it effectively. But Scaf absolutely insisted on maintaining the corruption of the old regime, on continuing the regime&apos;s attempts to corrupt and manipulate the judiciary; it seems heavily invested in maintaining the shape of the old regime. The effect of this has been that the revolution continues \u2013 against Scaf. In the 18 days from 25 January to 11 February, it seemed that the people did not want to destroy the state; they wanted to rescue it. The actions of Scaf, however, have in a sense clarified the situation. While many people still pay lip service to the importance of the state, and the armed forces as a pillar of the state, what is happening on the ground is an insistence on achieving the goals of the revolution. This is what the workers&apos;, farmers&apos;, students&apos; and civil servants&apos; strikes and industrial actions are all about. People are not looking for good governance any more but for a more profound change. There is a fundamental questioning \u2013 at the level of action \u2013 of what the state is or should be. The problem is that we have the actions but we have not developed the discourse to match them. Our actions are ahead of our discourse. I&apos;m optimistic. I believe our revolution will continue. In the elections, the people elected the revolution whenever they found someone who really represented it \u2013 otherwise they went to what they knew. We have a huge amount of work to do. But I believe that in this coming year the people will corner parliament into becoming loyal to the people and acting in response to their demands, not to whatever it thinks it has scripted. The revolution will not seize power but will push those in power towards its aims. Alaa Abd El Fattah is an Egyptian blogger.

Mourid Barghouti      Photograph: Eamonn McCabe    Step one: retrieval of political life Optimism or pessimism is the question a year after the Arab revolution(s). Having in mind all the setbacks, I am optimistic. The setbacks are numerous. The revolutionary forces are still being demonised, killed, tortured or kidnapped and sent to military trials. Justice is still far away and has not been done yet. Killers of the demonstrators are still at large and are being protected; the official media is still the same box of lies; misinformation and disinformation and the threat of conservative forces taking over has materialised. Revolution might be seen as a total failure and a sad event. But a revolution is not an event. Revolution is a process \u2013 a lengthy, laborious and demanding one. It has its ups and downs and its many surprises too. A coup d&apos;\u00e9tat is an event with immediate obvious and decisive results. The good thing is that Arabs are leaving behind a repeated practice of coups that tainted their modern history with illegitimate and ruthless military rulers. These rulers&apos; most treacherous crime was the killing of &quot;political life&quot; in their countries, where a parliament is not a parliament, a party is not a party, opposition is not opposition and laws are not laws. The past year has seen millions of Arabs engaged in discussion of political issues. Those millions are the guardians of their own dream, regardless of any official arrangements, including the election results. The banned Islamist groups, the only well-organised groups and the clear winners in ballot boxes, are now in the limelight, under public scrutiny. Rachid Ghannouchi, the leader of the An-Nahda party, gave in Tunis a simple answer to a journalist who asked him if his promises were genuine: &quot;If we don&apos;t fulfil our promises we&apos;ll hear it again, Irhal [leave].&quot; If a single scene could summarise the current historic moment in the Arab world it would be that horizontal image of Egypt&apos;s dictator, Hosni Mubarak, idly, helplessly, and with half-closed eyes, lying on a stretcher behind the court bars juxtaposed with the vertical, flying image of Ahmad El Shahat, the young Egyptian who climbed the 21 floors to the top of Israel&apos;s embassy in Cairo to rip down its flag. The future is coming. Mourid Barghouti is a Palestinian poet.   Raja Shehadeh      Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Palestine was never going to have an Arab spring, not as long as it remained occupied. Yet the uprisings taking place in Arab countries gave us hope. Prior to January 2010 the Palestinian predicament seemed desperate. Israel had a free hand building settlements and was refusing even to halt its colonial activities pending the negotiations with the Palestinians. All we got from our &quot;Arab brethren&quot; was advice that our leaders are better off doing Israel&apos;s bidding. It was difficult then to conceive of an improvement in our lot, and the possibility of ever mustering the power to bring an end to the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Then, when we least expected it, uprisings began in Tunis and spread to Egypt and Syria. Regimes that effectively protected Israel and stood silent in the face of its policies of oppressing and colonising the Palestinians were falling. This was no less true of countries that did not have peace agreements with Israel, such as Syria, as it was of Egypt. By entering into the 1978 Camp David treaty with Israel, Egypt gave it the illusion that peace would be possible without justice to the Palestinians. The late President Sadat effectively traded Sinai for a free hand for Israel in the West Bank where the pace of settling Israeli Jews began to increase \u2013 and has never abated. Ironically, in so doing, Sadat might have been ushering the undoing of Israel as its founders envisioned their country. The rise of democracy in Arab countries helps defeat one of the major arguments employed by Israel in the psychological warfare it wages against us. Many a Palestinian has accepted the Israeli argument that we would not be better off in an Arab country. The treatment Palestinians got at points of entry to Arab countries bore this out. Until recently, Israel could boast that it was the only country in the Middle East where the president and high officials could be put on trial. Now that Mubarak is on trial, this is no longer the case. With democracy on the rise the will of the people is more likely to be respected, and there is no doubt where their sympathies lie. With the Arab spring, a shaking up of the alliances in the region seemed imminent. We could hardly keep up with the pace of change. And yet if there is one political lesson one learns from observing political developments, it is that real change happens slowly. Whoever expected that the Arab spring to create immediate revolutionary change was dreaming. Yet where would we be without our dreams?

Nouri Gana      Nouri Gana    Syria&apos;s Assad and Yemen&apos;s Saleh continue to prove that dictators die hard; the counter-revolutionary forces in Egypt and Tunisia continue to prove that dictatorships die even harder. After it had kick-started the Arab uprisings of 2011, Tunisia is now on the uncharted road of democratisation, pluralism and coexistence in a world braced for economic and financial crisis. In the same manner that thousands of protestors flocked into Avenue Bourguiba on 14 January to prompt the unceremonious exit of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, thousands of voters flocked to polling booths on 23 October and queued for hours to cast their vote in Tunisia&apos;s historic constituent assembly elections. Despite the more than one hundred parties and hundreds of independents that took part in the elections, Tunisians voted in greatest numbers for the parties and political leaders who have a long history of resisting and opposing Bourguiba and Ben Ali. Tunisians dealt a sobering blow to the remnants of Ben Ali&apos;s regime and to the old and new parties that based their entire electoral campaign on the denigration of the Islamic party, Ennahda. By voting for the three parties that now form the coalition government \u2013 Ennahda, the Congress for the Republic and Ettakatol \u2013 Tunisians wanted, in part, also to correct the incalculable wrongs (exile, imprisonment, torture, etc) that were inflicted on the militants of these parties under both Bourguiba and Ben Ali. There have been, and continue to be, fears that Tunisia might slide one day into a theocracy, but these fears are unrealistic given the liveliness of public debate and the irrevocable rights of speech and protest that Tunisians have earned. The challenge for post-revolutionary Tunisia is rather to stay clear of interest- and identity-based politics, which continue to fuel debate and appropriate attention away from the more urgent questions of creating jobs, offering reparations to the families of the martyrs, and bringing the members of the old regime to justice. Democracy is on the march in Tunisia, but let&apos;s hope responsibility is not on the wane. Tunisia&apos;s obligation to the Arab world \u2013 indeed, to the world \u2013 is not to let the democratising process fail and to continue to inspire insurrection and revolt \u2013 and, at the same time, bring economic stability. Tunisia will be praiseworthy if it succeeds, but the international community will be blameworthy if it fails to help the country fulfill its obligation.

Joumana Haddad         Photograph: Eamonn McCabe    Are the revolts that occurred and that are occurring in the Arab world real revolutions? Are they also women&apos;s revolutions? The prognostics of the Egyptian, Tunisian and Lybian revolutions are not promising, to say the least, and we are still far from being rid of the patriarchal monopolisation of private and public life. One form of dictatorship seems to be getting replaced with another form: religious integralism. What kind of revolts are these if women are content to be just pawns &quot;mobilised&quot; at will, and neglected when decisions should be made? What revolutions, if these revolutions did not turn the tables of patriarchy on the heads of those oppressors, and if they will only bring forth a new form of backwardness and\u00a0subjugation? In view of the rotten Arab regimes (those that have fallen and those that undoubtedly will), which specialise in ignoring women&apos;s rights and debasing them, when will women in the Arab world move from the cry of &quot;give me my rights&quot; to the cry: &quot;I will take my rights with my own hands&quot;? When will the Arab woman believe that she was not just born to be married, bear children, obey, hide, be sold by and serve the men of her family? When will she realise that all talk of democracy is bullshit without equality with men? And that all talk of change and modernisation is bullshit, if her situation and position are not re-evaluated? When will she become furious over the gross insults that she is subjected to, and which aim at erasing her daily, in all fields? When will she stop participating in the fortification of the patriarchal system, with its stale values and barbed wires? When will the &quot;bomb&quot; of Arab women explode? I am speaking here\u00a0of\u00a0the bomb of her ability, ambition, liberty, strength and rights. The bomb of her anger at what is imposed on her and which she mostly accepts uncritically. The bomb of her self-confidence. That is the revolution we need. And that is the revolution we\u00a0deserve.

Samar Yazbek        Samar Yazbek    It&apos;s not easy to describe exactly how I feel about what&apos;s going on in Syria. It&apos;s like talking about a Surrealist painting where I&apos;m both the artist and the colours; or I might even go so far as to say it&apos;s like seeing my own heart suspended in front of me, and I&apos;m supposed to talk about it somehow, like a scene from some fantasy movie: a beating heart running away as its body chases after it. In Syria great truths overturn history; they are products of the impossible. Simple and ordinary folk are the stuff of proverbs and epics in demanding their freedom and dignity in the face of the killing machine, and in spite of all the mechanisms of media deception practised by the regime. Here is a new history on which the whole world must concentrate. The people&apos;s revolution has been defined by two pillars that embodied the moral foundation of the intifada: dignity and non-violence. Individual autonomy is the most important human right one can ask for, through a commitment to the culture of life and peace, even when confronted with the barbarism of a military-security killing machine that has been in power for more than 40 years. Those shouts for freedom and dignity rang out from the most impoverished and marginalised and miserable cities and small towns, before engulfing all of Syria. Despite all the attempts on the part of the regime to force the intifada into the furnace of a civil war and to encourage people to take up arms in order to strangle the essence of the uprising, it remains unable to turn this revolution into a guerilla war fought by the citizens of our united country. A danger looms on the horizon in the form of distractions arising from the regional, Arab and international situations. But the tricks\u00a0concocted by the regime and implemented by the security apparatus and the shabbiha against the people of our united country have been unmasked. The real fear now is from the scorched-earth policy pursued by the regime in those cities that have risen up against besiegement and starvation\u00a0and bombardment, risen up against those who would redirect the intifada away from its moral and nonviolent course in such a way that people would have to take up arms in order to defend themselves. But weapons are the opposite of freedom&apos;s\u00a0essence. The heroism displayed by the Syrian people allows me to be optimistic. Their path of resistance makes me ever more certain that this intifada is destined to become a precedent for the whole world. The pure meaning of courage is to stand unarmed and alone in the face of murder and all the firepower that can be mustered by cowardly oppression. (Translated by Max Weiss.)

In cartoonish marker pen and tangled pencil drawings, they show us everyday life&apos;s sinister side \u2013 from street crime and shady backroom dealings to sadistic orgies. The paintings these figures cavort in are appropriately murky \u2013 a sludge of greys, stunted greens and dulled pinks. And like that confused moment when you&apos;re emerging from a dream and things get all muddled up, earth and sky become one, men turn into beasts and the dead walk with the living. Are they creatures of nightmare, doomsday visions or the dregs of our own society in apocalyptic freefall? Born in 1966, the Tel Aviv-based Ben-Gal&apos;s earlier work (from the late 1990s) related to figures from front-page news, such as Yasser Arafat or Muammar Gaddafi. Yet it would be a mistake to read the Israeli artist&apos;s more recent disturbing imagery as explicitly relating to the Middle East conflicts that surround him. &quot;I&apos;m not interested in telling political fables through painting,&quot; he has said. Following a jumbled dream logic, Ben-Gal fuses repressed fantasies of flesh and aggression with banal details from waking life that anyone can relate to. His Hospital series from 2006 evokes a morphine haze of bad meals, strip lighting and the morbid boredom of the ward: death masks leer from the darkness in the painting Visiting Time; a white disembodied head, that might be a doctor or a ghost, floats against a patch of black; meanwhile, the limply phallic forms of a corn cob and a carrot are held at gunpoint in Hospital Food. Such works look beyond local issues, conveying humanity&apos;s bad dreams and a universal sense of dread. Why we like him: For the claustrophobic horror of Silent Movie. Within this stifling composition we can just make out a bearded man outside a house. Yet the lack of light makes the painting seem more like a closed box than an open space \u2013 a stage-set from which there is no escape.

A self-described pyromaniac as a child, who rolled A4 sheets of paper and smoked them like cigarettes, he&apos;s said that lighting fires on the canvas is a kind of therapy. Where can I see him?

This was the latest in a series of attacks over the past fortnight, which has also seen the credit card details of thousands of Israeli citizens leaked online. The online guerrilla campaign has left many Israelis feeling vulnerable in a domain where they believed they had absolute regional supremacy: technology and IT. Although the nationality of the hackers is not certain, to restore their national honour and create what they called &quot;deterrence&quot;, Israeli hackers were quick to retaliate against the stock exchanges in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. &quot;There was always a feeling that Israel is a technological &apos;superpower&apos; and a hi-tech nation,&quot; Bar Shem-Ur, a young reporter on a popular current affairs programme broadcast by Israel&apos;s liberal Channel 10, told me. &quot;I think that the recent attacks \u2026 broke some of the myths that surrounded the feeling that Israel can deal with anything in the cyber world.&quot; Of course, Israel is the Middle East&apos;s undisputed technological powerhouse, but anyone who lives here can tell you that the reality is far creakier and more makeshift than the image. Moreover, Arabs are hardly in the technological stone age and Palestinians, despite the restrictions of occupation, are gradually bolstering their innovative credentials. Nevertheless, many Israelis apparently do regard their nearest neighbours as being backward. &quot;Many Israelis believe that Palestinians are not educated, are just farmers and labourers, and have no idea about technology, despite the fact that many work in Israel&apos;s hi-tech sector,&quot; says Khulood, who is from Nazareth and works for an international agency. As an Israeli citizen who grew up among Israelis, Khulood speaks fluent Hebrew, is an independent, liberated and highly educated woman who lives alone, yet she finds many of her Jewish compatriots are convinced that Palestinian women are oppressed and locked up at home. &quot;It&apos;s not because [Jewish] Israelis don&apos;t encounter Arabs. It&apos;s just more comfortable for them to look down on us \u2013 it makes their colonial enterprise easier,&quot; she contends. &quot;If they acknowledge that we are similar, this will raise the uncomfortable question of why they don&apos;t treat us as equals.&quot; That said, demonisation is a two-way street, and Khulood acknowledges that Palestinians in Israel have their own negative stereotypes of Israelis, namely that they are devious, cunning and untrustworthy. Although there are Israelis who see this as a manifestation of classic antisemitism, Khulood believes these unflattering stereotypes have more to do with the reality of the conflict. &quot;We have an image of Israelis as people who only know violence, infringe on the rights of others and take their land,&quot; says Wajdi Kharraz, a qualified IT specialist from Nablus who now works in the family business. &quot;In our daily lives, we only see soldiers and in the media we only hear about Israeli violations. We don&apos;t see much of the other faces of Israel.&quot; Kharraz got the chance to see other facets of Israel and Israelis when he and a group of ordinary Palestinians went on a trip to Israel organised by a peace-building NGO. &quot;My view has changed. I have overcome the fear barrier,&quot; Kharraz says, reflecting on the experience. &quot;I used to see Israelis only as soldiers. But after meeting this group, all of whom have served in the IDF, I see they too are ordinary people like me. Now, when I go through a checkpoint, I see a person behind the gun; that this soldier is also human.&quot; Likewise, a group of ordinary Israelis visited Palestinian towns in the West Bank, which Israeli law prohibits them from entering without a special permit. &quot;Most of the Palestinians didn&apos;t know much about Judaism and their knowledge of Israel was mostly through the prism of the conflict,&quot; recalls Rachael, an Israeli university student from Jerusalem who is studying Islam. &quot;Even though they were quite secular, they were pleasantly surprised to learn how similar Judaism and Islam are.&quot; For her part, Rachael was encouraged by how eager the Palestinians were to learn about the Holocaust and the sympathy they expressed for Jewish suffering, despite all the talk in Israel of Arab Holocaust denial. On a lighter note, she recalls that their group included a couple of fair-complexioned Palestinians, one of whom even had red hair. This apparently threw some of the Israelis who expected all Palestinians to look &quot;Arab&quot;. &quot;After more than 60 years living together, we often look, dress and even act alike. In Israel, it can be very hard to tell an Arab from a Jew,&quot; Khulood said. &quot;Despite the conflict, we have gained things from them and they have gained things from us.&quot; And, with the failure of the formal peace process, it is perhaps this gradual, understated grassroots osmosis that offers some of the best hope for a future of greater equality and tolerance. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2012 to remove a quotation using the term &quot;chosen&apos;, because it was at odds with Guardian guidelines.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-19T13:47:46Z", "title": "Hacking away at Arab and Israeli stereotypes | Khaled Diab", "sentences": ["Earlier this week, a hacker or group of hackers who claim to be Saudi scaled up their cyber offensive against Israel by paralysing the websites of El Al airline and the Tel Aviv stock exchange."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/19/hacking-arab-israeli-stereotypes"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "When Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, said this week that his country was &quot;very far off&quot; from taking a decision about whether to bomb Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, may have allowed himself a moment of relief before boarding his flight to Tel Aviv on Thursday. But, mindful of Israel&apos;s record of blowing hot and, well, less hot on the issue, Dempsey will still deliver a strong message to Barak, the president, Shimon Peres, the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and his Israeli military counterpart, Benny Gantz: a military strike on Iran would have dire consequences; sanctions need more time; Israel and the US must work in partnership. Events over the past fortnight have increased US anxieties that \u2013 despite Barak&apos;s words, aimed at cooling the febrile atmosphere \u2013 Israel is actively considering steps which could plunge the region (and beyond) into a catastrophic war. Hence Barack Obama spoke directly to Netanyahu on the subject last week, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, privately sought assurances over Israel&apos;s intentions, and Dempsey flew in for a series of face-to-face meetings. Iran&apos;s claim on 8 January that it planned to start nuclear enrichment at its underground Fordow plant, near Qom, &quot;in the near future&quot; was seen as coming perilously close to one of Israel&apos;s &quot;red lines&quot;. It was followed a few days later by the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist, an operation widely attributed to the Mossad, Israel&apos;s fabled intelligence agency. Israel has maintained its usual omert\u00e0 on the hit, with only Peres saying that &quot;to the best of my knowledge&quot; the country was not involved. Meanwhile, Iran&apos;s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz has exacerbated tensions. This latest round of escalation comes only two months after intense speculation that Israel was gearing up for an imminent strike, with reports that Netanyahu was striving to persuade his divided cabinet to back such action. Some suggested that public sabre rattling was an attempt to persuade the international community to impose stiffer sanctions on Iran. And, indeed, Netanyahu gave an interview last weekend in which he suggested sanctions were working. &quot;For the first time, I see Iran wobble,&quot; he told the Australian. Three days later, he said the opposite: sanctions were ineffective, he told an Israeli parliamentary committee. US officials are uncertain how to read Israel&apos;s intentions given such contradictory statements. But there does appear to be a real debate within Israel&apos;s political and defence establishment over the merits of military action, and one that does not necessarily run along left-right, dove-hawk lines. The consequences of a strike are the dominant consideration. Tehran would be expected to order Hezbollah to launch a barrage of rockets from Lebanon in response. Hamas in Gaza may be instructed to do likewise, although since its relations with Tehran have cooled, there is less certainty it would comply. Even without a direct military response from Iran, Israel could find itself engaged in serious conflict on two of its borders with organisations which have significantly rearmed in the past couple of years. Another reason for debate concerns timing. The Obama administration is unwilling to get embroiled in a military conflict in an election year. Some believe that November&apos;s poll could produce a US president more sympathetic to Israel&apos;s inclination to strike. Others say it will be too late by next year, and in any case Obama may still be in the White House. There is another possible reason why Israel may decide not to strike, or at least not yet. Some suggest that covert operations, such as assassinations, are not just intended to impede Iran&apos;s nuclear progress but also to goad Tehran into action of its own or on its behalf by its proxies providing Israel \u2013 and the US \u2013 with a casus belli. In his brief visit, Dempsey will attempt to identify Israel&apos;s true intentions as well as delivering a strong message. Meanwhile, the US is stepping up practical contingency plans against the possibility of war, according to the Wall Street Journal. And, in the interview in which Barak said a decision was &quot;very far off&quot;, he also said that Washington and Israel &quot;respect one another&apos;s freedom of decision&quot;. The implications of that will not be reassuring to American ears.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-19T13:58:18Z", "title": "Israel may have taken a step back from bombing Iran \u2013 but for how long? | Harriet Sherwood", "sentences": ["When Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, said this week that his country was &quot;very far off&quot; from taking a decision about whether to bomb Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, may have allowed himself a moment of relief before boarding his flight to Tel Aviv on Thursday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/19/israel-iran-war-us"}, {"tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Innovation"], "article": "If 2011 was a year that the spotlight was laser-focused on the business sector&apos;s contribution to the intractable and myriad problems facing the world, let&apos;s hope that 2012 is the year that we focus solely on solutions. What we call inclusive innovation could be one such solution and one that is particularly relevant for the financial sector. No story better illustrates inclusive innovation than when Ofra Strauss, chair of the Israeli multinational food company, the Strauss Group, found Tel Aviv&apos;s Occupy movement protesters camping out in the front yard of her home. Strauss responded in an unconventional way: she came out of her house and did nothing but listen to the protesters \u2013 for seven hours. Her reaction afterwards was even more unusual. The protesters&apos; primary accusation was that her company&apos;s food prices were set too high. With special promotions and significant cuts in advertising she lowered the company&apos;s food prices, thereby extending the Strauss Group&apos;s social license to operate. If only the finance sector had reacted similarly. But there is still time, and a way forward, according to our recently released study, The Future of Finance. The study identifies an approach to inclusive innovation that sees the financial sector building a more positive relationship with regulators and other stakeholders by embracing business initiatives that seek positive social as well as financial returns. Multiple opportunities exist for banks to use their capabilities to drive positive change in a way that also grows their businesses. This can be done while enhancing trust, attracting the best talent and making the sector more resilient to future shocks. Inclusive innovation is a timely concept as it is increasingly evident that the financial industry is in the grips of a good old-fashioned reputation crisis. The recent wave of new regulations, independent reviews, testimonials before Congresses and parliaments, fines, handcuffs and imprisonments, shareholder resolutions and social protest movements, demonstrate how contested the financial industry&apos;s social license to operate has become. Indeed, the global Occupy movement is a direct manifestation of the public&apos;s loss of trust \u2013 in the past few years there has been a 30% increase in the proportion of Americans and Britons critical of the industry. While Occupy protesters may not fully represent 99% of the population, their core message certainly commands a sympathetic ear from the majority of the public: we need to be listened to, we need to be included. One of the strengths of a capitalist system is that it incentivises innovation. The market rewards the creators of new products and services that meet unmet needs or give us new capabilities. The thought leaders we interviewed for The Future of Finance project call for the financial sector to demonstrate that its innovations meet the criterion that they include, and deliver greater benefit to, the wider society. There is a sense that, for all its potential to make a profound impact on the world, the attention of financial innovators has been turned inward, forever seeking ways to do what they already do but faster, more efficiently and more profitably. With 2.5 billion unbanked people around the world and a host of diverse problems that financial tools could be leveraged toward solving, we would advocate that the financial sector pursue the growth that it needs by turning its innovation outward, seeking inclusion and positive social impact, in addition to well-earned profits.

Bergman&apos;s answer, which comes in the last paragraph, is yes:  After speaking with many senior Israeli leaders and chiefs of the military and the intelligence, I have come to believe that Israel will indeed strike Iran in 2012. Perhaps in the small and ever-diminishing window that is left, the United States will choose to intervene after all, but here, from the Israeli perspective, there is not much hope for that. Instead there is that peculiar Israeli mixture of fear \u2014 rooted in the sense that Israel is dependent on the tacit support of other nations to survive \u2014 and tenacity, the fierce conviction, right or wrong, that only the Israelis can ultimately defend themselves.  Bergman is one of a small circle of heavyweights in the Israeli media who spend a significant amount of time with the politicians, spies and generals who are going to make the ultimate decision. So his assessment carries more weigh that your average Israel-Iran analyst. Here is one of the key paragraphs:  The Israeli Air Force is where most of the preparations are taking place. It maintains planes with the long-range capacity required to deliver ordnance to targets in Iran, as well as unmanned aircraft capable of carrying bombs to those targets and remaining airborne for up to 48 hours. Israel believes that these platforms have the capacity to cause enough damage to set the Iranian nuclear project back by three to five years.   Three to five years seems a very confident estimate. The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, reckoned in December that such strikes could set the Iranians back one or two years &quot;at best&quot;. Bergman also talks to a Mossad veteran, Rafi Eitan, whose own estimate was &quot;not even three months&quot;.  Bergman spent a lot of time in recent months with the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and is particularly revealing on his strategic thinking. He does not necessarily share Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s apocalyptic view of Iran&apos;s intentions, but believes a nuclear Iran will be more aggressive and harder to counter.  &quot;From our point of view,&quot; Barak said, &quot;a nuclear state offers an entirely different kind of protection to its proxies. Imagine if we enter another military confrontation with Hezbollah, which has over 50,000 rockets that threaten the whole area of Israel, including several thousand that can reach Tel Aviv. A nuclear Iran announces that an attack on Hezbollah is tantamount to an attack on Iran. We would not necessarily give up on it, but it would definitely restrict our range of operations.&quot;  At that point Barak leaned forward and said with the utmost solemnity: &quot;And if a nuclear Iran covets and occupies some gulf state, who will liberate it? The bottom line is that we must deal with the problem now.&quot;   Bruce Riedel, a former CIA Middle East specialist, takes the opposite view, arguing in Lebanon&apos;s Daily Star today that even with the bomb, Iran would not be an existential threat to Israel. Riedel&apos;s view probably reflects the majority outlook at the CIA and the White House. Bergman examines this divergence in American and Israeli assessments, and wonders how much notice Israel would give Washington of an attack. Matthew Kroenig, a former Pentagon advisor now at the Council on Foreign Relations, reckons it will be &quot;an hour or two, just enough to maintain good relations between the countries but not quite enough to allow Washington to prevent the attack&quot;. Jeffrey Goldberg has put out a piece in The Atlantic in response to Bergman, suggesting that Bergman&apos;s analysis might be premature, and pointing out that the same people that Bergman talked to had previously convinced Goldberg that the attack would come last summer. Clearly, Israeli has a motive in conveying the impression that an attack might be imminent, to stir up urgency in the West to confront Iran. Ultimately, as Bergman admits, only Netanyahu and Barak really know how much is bluff and how much real intention. That is a lot more interesting stuff in Bergman&apos;s piece. He is bringing out a book this month, called The Secret War with Iran, (clarification: an updated English version of his 2007 book of the same title) which sounds like it will be a gripping read, and of course the NYT article helps drum up interest and sales. In it, Bergman gives a colourful description of a meeting in January 2011 with the outgoing Mossad boss, Meir Dagan, who has argued vehemently against an attack on Iran.   We were told to congregate in the parking lot of a movie-theater complex north of Tel Aviv, where we were warned by Mossad security personnel, &quot;Do not bring computers, recording devices, cellphones. You will be carefully searched, and we want to avoid unpleasantness. Leave everything in your cars and enter our vehicles carrying only paper and pens.&quot; We were then loaded into cars with opaque windows and escorted by black Jeeps to a site that we knew was not marked on any map. The cars went through a series of security checks, requiring our escorts to explain who we were and show paperwork at each roadblock.  This was the first time in the history of the Mossad that a group of journalists was invited to meet the director of the organization at one of the country&apos;s most secret sites.   Presumably there will be much more of this in the book. However, when it comes to covert operations, as with the nuclear programme, there are things that Israeli journalists know but cannot say, and must attribute to non-Israeli sources. For example, Bergman does not say outright that Israel is behind the assassinations of Israeli nuclear scientists but reports lots of nods and winks in that direction. Here is an example of the journalistic animut (opacity):  Operating in Iran ... is impossible for the Mossad&apos;s sabotage-and-assassination unit, known as Caesarea, so the assassins must come from elsewhere. Iranian intelligence believes that over the last several years, the Mossad has financed and armed two Iranian opposition groups, the Muhjahedin Khalq (MEK) and the Jundallah, and has set up a forward base in Kurdistan to mobilize the Kurdish minority in Iran, as well as other minorities, training some of them at a secret base near Tel Aviv.   Is Bergman really channeling Iranian intelligence here, or laundering something he knows by attributing it to Iranian intelligence? Hard to know for sure, but it certainly reads like the latter. So his NYT piece and probably his book will no doubt tell us a lot about Israel&apos;s intentions but not as much as Bergman undoubtedly knows.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-25T15:27:00Z", "title": "'Israel will indeed strike Iran in 2012'", "sentences": ["Imagine if we enter another military confrontation with Hezbollah, which has over 50,000 rockets that threaten the whole area of Israel, including several thousand that can reach Tel Aviv.", "We were told to congregate in the parking lot of a movie-theater complex north of Tel Aviv, where we were warned by Mossad security personnel, &quot;Do not bring computers, recording devices, cellphones.", "Iranian intelligence believes that over the last several years, the Mossad has financed and armed two Iranian opposition groups, the Muhjahedin Khalq (MEK) and the Jundallah, and has set up a forward base in Kurdistan to mobilize the Kurdish minority in Iran, as well as other minorities, training some of them at a secret base near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jan/25/israel-iran"}, {"tags": ["Newt Gingrich", "Republican presidential nomination 2012", "Republicans", "US politics", "US elections 2012", "Florida", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Abraham Foxman, the amiably chatty director of the Jewish civil rights group, the Anti-Defamation League, has a story to tell about his friend, the 78-year-old multi-billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. Adelson, who is America&apos;s eighth richest man and has given millions of dollars in support of Newt Gingrich&apos;s presidential bid, was having dinner with Foxman in Las Vegas several years ago. Foxman let slip that he was having to miss an invitation to the White House from the then president, George W. Bush. Foxman explained it was impossible to get a commercial flight. Adelson replied: &quot;If the president of the United States asks you to go, you go.&quot; Then he gave Foxman the use of his private plane. Foxman asked Adelson if any condition was attached to the spontaneous act of generosity. &quot;The condition is that you tell President Bush that is how you got there,&quot; said Adelson. Foxman made it in time to meet the president. It is a classic vignette to describe the power and style of Adelson, a man who has given scores of millions of dollars to Republican and Jewish causes over the years but who only now \u2013 by backing Gingrich \u2013 is becoming known to the wider public. It shows the reach of great wealth and how it mixes with the most powerful people on earth. It also shows Adelson&apos;s willingness to use that wealth for causes and people he believes in. Gingrich, the latest beneficiary of Adelson&apos;s goodwill, suddenly has an outside chance of becoming president. The veteran firebrand upset the entire Republican race by coming from behind to record a stunning victory in South Carolina. The win rocked the campaign of the frontrunner, the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and pitched the two candidates into a showdown in Florida on Tuesday. If Gingrich can win there, the contest could go all the way to the party&apos;s convention in Tampa, Florida, in August. And if Gingrich wins the nomination, then the first person he ought to thank is Adelson. Together with his wife Miriam, Adelson has donated $10m to a &quot;Super PAC&quot; backing Gingrich&apos;s presidential bid. Super PACs (political action committees) are a new group of organisations, created by a recent loosening of campaign finance laws, that can accept unlimited donations as long as there is no official co-ordination with a candidate&apos;s campaign. The donations are among the largest from individuals in US political history. While other rivals to Romney struggle for cash, Gingrich does not. The Super PAC, Winning Our Future, has put TV ads all over the airwaves and even bought space for a half-hour anti-Romney documentary that helped give Gingrich his victory in South Carolina. Critics have said Adelson&apos;s backing of Gingrich ushers in a dangerous new world where America&apos;s wealthiest people might feel able to single-handedly sponsor a major candidate&apos;s bid for the White House. In a system already awash with campaign donations and money from lobbyists, such a level of financial backing has some worried. &quot;It is an arms race of money. You can imagine a world where you can&apos;t get elected without the backing of a billionaire,&quot; said Professor Noah Feldman, a constitutional law expert at Harvard. &quot;Adelson is not breaking any rules. But the rules are mad,&quot; he added. Adelson and his wife do not see it that way. &quot;Our motivation for helping Newt is simple and should not be mistaken for anything other than the fact that we hold our friendship with him very dear and are doing what we can as private citizens to support his candidacy,&quot; they said in a joint statement issued to the Observer. The Adelsons believe their contributions to Gingrich differ only in scale, not kind, from those of any other citizen. &quot;Our means of support might be more than others are able to offer but, like most Americans, words such as friendship and loyalty still mean something to us,&quot; they added. Insiders at Adelson&apos;s company, Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVSC), say the billionaire does not understand why some groups \u2013 such as labour unions \u2013 do not get the same media scrutiny when their campaign contributions are likely to be in total much larger. &quot;The attention he is getting is a little puzzling to him,&quot; one company source said. That raises an interesting thought. Labour unions give money to political campaigns in order to further their interests and that of their working members. So, in turn, what does Adelson want for his money? &quot;Elections are not a &apos;bro-mance&apos;. You expect something in return. Everyone knows that,&quot; said Feldman. Adelson was not always a rich rightwing Republican. He was born poor in the liberal heartland of Massachusetts, where being a Democrat was the norm. His father, a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania, was a cab driver in Boston while his mother ran a knitting shop. They brought up Adelson and his three siblings in a tenement in a tough neighbourhood of the town of Dorchester. For a while the family slept together in the same room. \uf702 But Adelson had street smarts that seemed perfect for business. His first job, with money borrowed from an uncle, was at 12 when he sold newspapers on street corners. At 16 he was running a vending machine business. He became a court reporter, joined the army, sold de-icers, invested in real estate and packaged toiletries among many other things. Some ventures worked, others did not. The idea that launched Adelson into the world&apos;s financial elite was Comdex, a computer trade show that he launched in 1979. It grew into a huge hit, attracting tens of thousands of visitors. &quot;He does not tolerate mediocrity. He just does not &apos;settle&apos; for anything,&quot; said Jason Chudnofsky, a former Comdex executive who worked with Adelman for years. Even back in the 1970s, according to Chudnofsky, Adelman boasted his business acumen would one day put him in the company of world leaders. &quot;He said we would deal with ministers and presidents of countries. Everything he said then is coming true now,&quot; Chudnofsky said.In 1989 Adelson nurtured his now booming convention business by buying the old Sands hotel in Las Vegas. By 1995 Comdex was sold with Adelson reportedly earning $510m for his controlling stake. It was just the beginning. Adelson&apos;s empire now includes the Venetian and the Palazzo in Vegas and has expanded into Asia. He is now a billionaire at least 20 times over. It has also made him a Republican. He was apparently converted to the rightwing cause by William Bush, elder brother of the first President Bush, after they met during the 1988 election.Adelson once told a Washington party he &quot;switched immediately&quot; after a talk with Bush. Through the 1990s and 2000s, as Adelson got richer and also battled trade unions at his Las Vegas casinos, he became more and more politically active. He was generous to George W. Bush&apos;s re-election campaign in 2004, and by 2008 helped bankroll Freedom&apos;s Watch, a group that ran ads against Democrats and in support of the Iraq war, to the tune of at least $15m. He also became a backer of Gingrich and a personal friend. They first met while Gingrich was Speaker of the House in the 1990s. Since 2006 their ties have also been financial. In that year Adelson gave $1m to a group called American Solutions for Winning the Future that served as Gingrich&apos;s political organisation. By 2010 Adelson had donated around another $6m to the group as Gingrich toured the country, touting his causes and contemplating a presidential run. Eventually this group turned into the Super PAC Winning Our Future. The cheques from Adelson kept coming. It is not just the American right that is Adelson&apos;s great political passion. There is also Israel. Always proud of his Jewish heritage, Adelson&apos;s activism took a pronounced leap when he married his second wife, Miriam, in 1991. She was an Israeli citizen who had been working in New York. The Adelsons are friends of Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and Adelson purchased a Hebrew-language newspaper to support him. Adelson is an impassioned opponent of an independent Palestine. He has given at least $60m to the charity Taglit-Birthright, which brings young Jewish Americans on trips to Israel. He has established a thinktank in Jerusalem and given large sums of cash to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust research centre. In the US he has donated to the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, helping fund the trips of Republican congressmen to Israel. All of this dovetails with Gingrich&apos;s policies on Israel. Gingrich has vowed that on the very first day of his administration he would order America&apos;s Israeli embassy to move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has called for regime change in Iran and repeatedly denied that Palestinians are a real people, saying instead they have been &quot;invented&quot;. In domestic politics, Gingrich has advocated getting rid of child labour laws so that poor children can work as janitors in their schools. He is an ardent fan of slashing federal government and loosening Wall Street regulations. He has warned that President Obama is a socialist who threatens America&apos;s traditional way of life. What Adelson thinks of these exact views is less known. Though often happy to talk to the business press, he rarely speaks to the media beyond that. His press spokesman, Ron Reese, said Adelson had turned down at least 50 interview requests in recent days. But Adelson is happy to use his billions to defend himself. In 2008 his lawyers tried to get reporters barred from a case brought by someone suing for compensation they said was owed after a deal in Macao. He also sued John L Smith, a Las Vegas journalist over a book he wrote. Though Adelson eventually dropped the case after several years and paid some of Smith&apos;s legal costs, the journalist was still forced into bankruptcy. &quot;Sheldon is a bully. He likes to get his own way. He hates it when people disagree with him... he does not like the spotlight when it is a critical spotlight,&quot; Smith said. Nor is Adelson&apos;s life without controversies now. He is fighting several lawsuits in Nevada. One, brought by former employer Steve Jacobs, accuses Adelson and his firm of wrongful dismissal after Jacobs claimed he refused to follow instructions to dig up dirt on Chinese officials that could be used as &quot;leverage&quot; to help the business in Asia. Adelson and Las Vegas Sands Corp have denied the charges, saying they come from a disgruntled employee. But the Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed the firm for documents. The Nevada Gaming Board has also launched an investigation. Another case has been brought by Adelman&apos;s former driver, Kwame Luangisa, who alleges he is owed overtime payments from the billionaire and his firm. Again, the accusations have been denied. Adelson&apos;s personal life too has had its legal problems. In 1997, his sons sued him, claiming he had tricked them into selling their Comdex stocks back to him for less than they were worth. They lost. But the implications of such a family dispute hitting the law courts clearly struck Judge Hiller Zobel, who wrote in his judgment that the trial was &quot;like something from the playwright Arthur Miller&quot;. Evidence had revealed the sons as &quot;self-indulgent, substance-abusing, over-pampered&quot; and depicted Adelson as a &quot;harsh, demanding, unfeeling&quot; person, the judge wrote. It was a rare glimpse into Adelson&apos;s private life. Smith, who knows first hand what it means to cross Adelson, thinks his own experience told him a little of what Adelson could be like. &quot;He is fascinating. He&apos;s worth billions, but he&apos;s pugilistic as the day is long,&quot; Smith said. &quot;In his mind he&apos;s constantly under siege.&quot; There is certainly no doubting the passion Adelson feels for his causes or the lengths he will go to fight for them. In 2008 he flew 40 wounded US soldiers for a weekend in Las Vegas on a private jet. They stayed in suites usually reserved for high-rollers. When one soldier, who had brought his girlfriend along, decided to get married in the city, Adelson paid for that, too. &quot;He&apos;s known as this tough person, but one-on-one he can be a softy,&quot; said Foxman. Not that Mitt Romney would agree. ** The money Adelson has poured into Gingrich&apos;s cause has battered Romney&apos;s campaign. An Adelson-funded Gingrich has become Romney&apos;s most implacable foe. Even if Gingrich loses in Florida, he will be able to fight on with a billionaire&apos;s backing. &quot;The past would suggest that they [the Adelsons] will continue to finds ways to support Newt in the future,&quot; said a company source close to Adelson. Chudnofsky put it more bluntly. &quot;He&apos;s not going to stop. If he&apos;s said he is going to support Gingrich, then he will go all in.&quot;.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-01-28T15:05:19Z", "title": "Secrets of the billionaire backing Gingrich's shot at the White House", "sentences": ["Gingrich has vowed that on the very first day of his administration he would order America&apos;s Israeli embassy to move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/28/newt-gingrich-sheldon-adelson-billionaire"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Michael Jackson", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Michael Jackson went to his grave pop&apos;s greatest enigma. He was arguably the most famous man in the world, but his own world seemed so utterly alien \u2013 the theme-park mansion, the plastic surgery, the rumours of paedophilia, the children conceived by artificial insemination, the erratic behaviour, not to mention the almost inhuman degree of talent \u2013 that it was impossible to work out what the man at the centre of it all was actually like. There&apos;s a chance that, after living 41 of his 51 years in the public eye, Jackson was as confused as anybody else. Yet two memoirs \u2013 one by his elder brother, the other by his former personal manager \u2013 claim to offer a definitive picture.     Jermaine Jackson, You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes    Neither does, although his brother&apos;s book is the more substantial and, initially at least, the more insightful of the two. Reading the section about Jackson&apos;s early life you wonder not why he became so weird, but how he didn&apos;t end up even weirder. His mother was a devout Jehovah&apos;s Witness \u2013 aged 12, Jackson was required to record an album of songs for Christmas, a holiday he&apos;d never been permitted to celebrate \u2013 who swabbed her children with alcohol, smeared their faces with Vaseline in the belief it made them look &quot;nice and shiny&quot; and protected them from the winter cold by putting boiled potatoes in their coat pockets. Meanwhile, the best that can be said of Joseph Jackson is that he isn&apos;t quite the grimmest figure in the pantheon of tyrannical fathers vicariously living their dreams of pop stardom through their children: that remains the Beach Boys&apos; patriarch Murry Wilson, who beat his son Brian about the head so viciously he allegedly deafened him in one ear. Still, Jackson whipped his children with a belt and the cord from an electric kettle and forced them to spend hours pointlessly carrying cinder blocks from one side of the garden to the other. The Jackson 5 would rehearse for up to five hours a night after school \u2013 if one of them got a dance step wrong their father would order the offender to break a branch off a nearby tree and would then hit him with it. When he learned that the teenage Michael was self-conscious about the size of his nose, he began calling him Big Nose. Whatever else you think of how Jackson&apos;s face looked by the time his plastic surgeons had finished with it, you certainly couldn&apos;t have called him that.     Frank Cascio, My Friend Michael: An Ordinary Friendship with an Extraordinary Man: The Story of an Ordinary Friendship with an Extraordinary Man    It reads like a misery memoir, but Jermaine claims not to see it that way. He presents all this ghastly evidence then spends pages admonishing as &quot;ridiculous&quot; those who suggest that his father&apos;s abuse scarred his most famous son for life. Never mind that Michael was still telling interviewers that the thought of his father made him feel sick with fear. No: their father&apos;s discipline instilled in them a will to succeed; furthermore without it, the Jackson boys might have ended up involved with the gangs that ran riot in their corner of Indiana. This kind of contradiction turns out to be the book&apos;s recurring motif. At one juncture, Jermaine angrily complains that Michael&apos;s famous relationship with Bubbles the chimpanzee was &quot;no different&quot; to that of &quot;millions of dog and cat owners the world over&quot;, before going on to describe Jackson dousing the chimpanzee in Poison by Christian Dior and supplying him with his own wardrobe: Bubbles was apparently better dressed than Jermaine&apos;s children. But You Are Not Alone&apos;s detail on what you might call the Wacko years, those after Thriller&apos;s record-breaking success, is sketchy: after unexpectedly calling time on a trying final Jacksons tour, Michael seems to have gone out of his way to avoid his family. My Friend Michael (William Morrow, \u00a316.99) handily takes up the slack. It&apos;s subtitled An Ordinary Friendship With an Extraordinary Man, but there seems to be nothing ordinary about the friendship at all. Frank Cascio was four when he first met Jackson: his father was the manager of the New York hotel where the singer stayed. The first time Jackson was accused of child molestation, Cascio&apos;s father&apos;s reaction was to pull his son out of school and send him to Tel Aviv to keep Jackson company on tour. He ended up an employee, trying to sort out business affairs so chaotic that they brought a man who had sold 750m records to the brink of financial ruin. It&apos;s a largely uncritical account, and yet Jackson still cuts a strangely pathetic figure: a middle-aged man addicted to prescription drugs, obsessed with pranks and water balloon fights, hopelessly chasing the childhood that had been denied him. The most intriguing things about Cascio&apos;s book are the disparities with Jermaine&apos;s account. Both are adamant that he was not a child molester: so adamant in Jermaine&apos;s case that, during his brother&apos;s 2003 trial, he rang up CNN, demanded to be put on air and shouted &quot;My brother is not eccentric!&quot;, which, with the best will in the world, feels a bit like ringing up CNN and shouting &quot;I am not shouting!&quot; But while Jermaine insists that Lisa Marie Presley was the love of Jackson&apos;s life, Cascio claims the singer told him their marriage was nothing more than a business arrangement. Neither of them has much to say about the music, nor the remarkable burst of creativity that began with the Jacksons&apos; 1978 album Destiny and culminated in the world-beating Thriller and Bad, nor the slow decline in quality that set in thereafter. They take it as read that his final album Invincible didn&apos;t sell as well as its predecessors because of a shadowy music industry conspiracy against him, never considering the more prosaic reason that it isn&apos;t very good. Jackson seems to have always had appalling taste in everything but music and choreography. The description of his singlehanded remodelling of the family home Hayvenhurst in You Are Not Alone is unwittingly hilarious (&quot;a painted mural filled one wall \u2026 a cartoon version of Michael perched high in a tree reading a book with the title The Secret of Life&quot;). Just as his increased wealth allowed him to pursue his passion for schlock to new heights at his Neverland ranch, so his success ensured it would gradually seep into his music as well: &quot;Earth Song&quot;, with its deathless question &quot;what about elephants \u2013 have we lost their trust?&quot;, Invincible&apos;s creepy &quot;The Lost Children&quot; and &quot;Speechless&quot;. He was so rich and famous no one could tell him to lay off the children&apos;s choirs and tone down the Messiah complex a little. He was still at it just before his death: &quot;I&apos;m the light of the world&quot;, he sang on &quot;This Is It&quot;, intended as the theme song for his 2009 London concert residency, but released posthumously. You Are Not Alone&apos;s description of preparations for those concerts makes for a harrowing counterpoint to the glossy, posthumous documentary based around them. The book claims, not entirely convincingly, that indications of Jackson&apos;s ill-health in the year before his death \u2013 photographs of him being pushed in a wheelchair, his visible frailty at the press conference to announce the London shows \u2013 were &quot;all part of a clever plan&quot; to make his comeback seem more stunning. But midway through rehearsals his health declined dramatically, possibly as a result of being administered on a nightly basis the general anaesthetic that eventually killed him. In Jermaine&apos;s telling, a man barely capable of standing was pressured by promoters fearful of losing money into continuing work. Michael Jackson, it seems, ended his career as he began it: impossibly talented but terrified, bullied into singing and dancing whether he wanted to or not. \u2022 Buy You Are Not Alone, by Jermaine Jackson or My Friend Michael, by Frank Cascio at reduced prices from the Guardian Bookshop", "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T09:00:00Z", "title": "You Are Not Alone by Jermaine Jackson \u2013 review", "sentences": ["The first time Jackson was accused of child molestation, Cascio&apos;s father&apos;s reaction was to pull his son out of school and send him to Tel Aviv to keep Jackson company on tour."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/01/you-are-not-alone-jermaine-jackson-review"}, {"tags": ["Documentary", "Film", "Culture", "Regeneration"], "article": "There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, of amateur archeologists making an astonishing discovery in the dunes outside Guadalupe, California. There, beneath the sand, lay what appeared to be the ruins of an ancient Egyptian civilisation: the\u00a0remnants of sphinxes, the skeletons of chariots. It turned out to be the rubble from a Hollywood film set. The film in question was 1923&apos;s The Ten Commandments, a silent-screen epic by Cecil B DeMille. No expense had been spared. The director hired 1,600 builders to construct a 10-acre site on the Guadalupe dunes, complete with a towering temple, 21 plaster sphinxes and a quartet of Ramses statues weighing 20 tonnes each. But\u00a0when shooting wrapped, DeMille ordered that the whole place be bulldozed into a 300ft trench. There it\u00a0remains to this day; a very Hollywood kind of ghost town. Ghost towns are the eyesores in our midst, socio-economic roadkill; either imperfectly bulldozed or left to rot in the sun. The dictionary defines them as &quot;deserted settlements, especially in the western US&quot;, which may explain their curious, symbiotic relationship with the American film industry. The birth of Hollywood, after all, coincided with the dying days of the wild west. It was a time in which Wyatt Earp worked as a studio script consultant and a collection of rusting former boom towns provided backdrops for anyone wanting to shoot a cowboy picture. In the decades before it was thrown a lifeline by the tourist trade, the town of Lone Pine, California served as the base for over 250 westerns, including High Sierra and the peerless Bad Day at Black Rock, in which a one-armed Spencer Tracy confronts the locals of a misbegotten desert hamlet. Guadalupe, meanwhile, was a regular Hollywood destination until the 1940s, after which it became a hotbed of gambling, drugs and prostitution. And yet \u2013 like snowflakes, or grains of sand \u2013 no one ghost town is ever exactly like the other. To further muddy the waters, many confound the official dictionary definition by exhibiting stubborn, grubby signs of life. Take the case of Bombay Beach, a haunting documentary about the lost souls who found a California ghost town and made it their home. History records that the film&apos;s backdrop enjoyed a brief heyday as a 1950s resort, playing host to Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Frank Sinatra. It is now parched, peeling and largely abandoned; a collection of derelict houses strung out under the telegraph wires. Even so, a smattering of misfits are still in residence. &quot;The desert is very unforgiving,&quot; explains one. &quot;You have to improvise in order to survive.&quot;     'Bombay Beach is a haunting documentary about the lost souls who found a California ghost town and made it their home.'    Bombay Beach \u2013 arranged in a series of startling, stylised tableaux by Israeli film-maker Alma Har&apos;el \u2013 picks out three individuals in particular. It charts the travails of troubled, seven-year-old Benny Parrish, born to a family of flag-waving survivalists. It introduces us to teenaged Ceejay, on the run from gangland violence in Los Angeles and dreaming of a new life at college. And it shows us the ancient, incorrigible Red, a one-time oil man and unreconstructed racist who appears to subsist on a diet of alcohol and cigarettes alone. In this way the film paints a portrait of what the New York Times has described as the &quot;three ages of man in post-apocalyptic America&quot;. No doubt it&apos;s this human element that makes Bombay Beach so compelling. Without the presence of Benny, CeeJay and Red, Har&apos;el&apos;s film might have risked becoming poverty tourism; an aesthetic pose, marvelling at the beauty of the junkyard or the sight of Main Street run to seed. As it is, there&apos;s something glorious about it. &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; allows Ha&apos;rel. &quot;But I actually have no real criticism for people who choose to go down that road: it&apos;s an intuitive, naive process of discovery. Ruins offer a lot of texture and composition. There&apos;s always a romance in the chaos. I mean, we don&apos;t get to see things that age any more. It&apos;s easier to buy something new than fix something old. So I can totally understand why people are drawn to the aesthetic of the ghost town.&quot; Har&apos;el would be forgiven for viewing America&apos;s ghost towns as exotic foreign ground. In fact, she claims that Bombay Beach felt weirdly familiar. &quot;Israel, like America, started as a promise. So growing up, I felt like I&apos;d been thrown into this place that was such a mix of history and obligation, hope, violence and tragedy. There&apos;s a settlement called Mitzpe Ramon, about three hours outside Tel Aviv, that&apos;s very like Bombay Beach. It&apos;s outside of society - inhabited by religious communities or people who are escaping their situation. So I don&apos;t think of these places as a purely American phenomenon. You can see that kind of post-apocalyptic urban wilderness all over the world.&quot; Here in the UK, the role of the ghost town is largely filled by what writer Marion Shoard first christened the &quot;edgelands&quot; \u2013 those wild frontiers of our major urban centres, where the tyre yard sits cheek-by-jowl with the crumbling Victorian factory and the man-made lake without a name. &quot;It&apos;s basically the logic of the American boom town, transplanted here,&quot; explains Michael Symmons Roberts, co-author of the book Edgelands: Journeys Into England&apos;s True Wilderness. &quot;You can see the edgeland as a barometer for economic change. When the developers run out of money, what&apos;s left is a lot of half-built or half-empty buildings. They become the site for exciting and illicit behaviour. If you see these places on film or TV, it&apos;s always where the drug deal happens or the kidnapper is hiding out.&quot; What drew Symmons Roberts to the edgelands \u2013 first as a child, then later as a poet \u2013 was the thrill of a place that is unmapped, unnamed, and often unwatched. To visit the edgeland is to step into a wilderness that&apos;s radically different from the &quot;managed rural landscapes&quot; that pass themselves off as wild and to catch a recent history in the raw. &quot;It&apos;s a great perspective on our past, because it shows you the economic reality: the decay of what was once important and the green shoots of something starting up. It&apos;s like a litmus test of what we value and who we are.&quot; But maybe there&apos;s a danger here as well. In shooting Bombay Beach, Alma Har&apos;el inevitably leaves the town exposed. In naming the unnamed, Symmons Roberts risks destroying its mystery. &quot;I heard about a reading group that organised a bus tour to visit their local edgelands,&quot; he confesses. &quot;I\u00a0wasn&apos;t sure what to think about that. I mean, we want people to appreciate these places without putting them in aspic. As soon as you slap on a preservation order, the whole thing&apos;s over.&quot; Back in Guadalupe that process is already under way. There are plans (currently delayed by lack of funds) to excavate the set of The Ten Commandments and stick the props in an exhibition centre. And yet the thing about Bombay Beach \u2013 or the edgelands \u2013 is that they are not dead and buried under the dust. Their ruins grow over and their abandoned buildings are made use of. They exist off the radar and remain in flux. The obituaries, it seems, were premature. &quot;People say that Bombay Beach is about the death of the American dream,&quot; says Har&apos;el. &quot;But I think it actually shows the diversity and the variety of the American dream, and how that dream can twist and survive, even in the worst ghost town in California. So many people are in Bombay Beach because they are running away from something. But they are living their lives and those lives are inspiring.&quot; Post-apocalyptic, perhaps, is just another term for rebirth and renewal.

A major, serious country like Iran cannot let this go on. They want to deter Israel and extract a price so that decision-makers in Israel think twice before they order an attack on an Iranian scientist,&quot; Yoram Cohen said in a lecture reported in Haaretz. Three attempted attacks were thwarted at the last minute in the past year, in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Thailand, he said. Four Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated in the past two years in what Iran \u2013 and many others in the international community \u2013 believe are operations by the Israeli secret services, or its proxy agents, as part of a covert war. Israel usually maintains a code of silence on activities by its security agencies, Shin Bet and the Mossad. But the president, Shimon Peres, said &quot;to the best of my knowledge&quot; the country was not involved in the most recent assassination, less than a month ago. Cohen&apos;s warning of retaliatory attacks came amid mounting speculation Israel is moving closer to launching a unilateral military strike against Iran. The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, declined to deny claims in a column in the Washington Post that said he believed Israel would launch an attack in April, May or June this year. And Israel&apos;s defence secretary, Ehud Barak, told a security conference that the window for action would close when Iran reached an &quot;immunity zone&quot; with its enrichment activities moved deep underground beyond the reach of air bombardment. &quot;Those who say &apos;later&apos; may find that later is too late,&quot; he said. Britain&apos;s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, this week voiced fears Israel could take unilateral military action against Iran. &quot;Of course I worry that there will be a military conflict and that certain countries might seek to take matters into their own hands,&quot; he told the House magazine. The Shin Bet chief also said Iran was building closer ties with Islamic Jihad in Gaza following its rift with Hamas over the Syrian uprising. However, relations between Hamas and Tehran may be repaired when Ismail Haniyeh, the de facto prime minister of Gaza, visits the Iranian capital in the coming days. During his invitation-only lecture in Tel Aviv on Thursday, Cohen said the security agency was concerned about extremist religious settlers in the West Bank who &quot;have decided to take the road of terror \u2026 [lashing] out at Arabs and [their] sacred symbols&quot;.

The attacks on Monday, in which four people were injured, followed a warning from Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, earlier this month that the Islamic Republic would retaliate against international sanctions and would back any nation or group that sought to confront Israel. In Delhi, witnesses said they saw assailants on motorcycles attaching a device to a car when it stopped at a traffic light. In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, an Israeli embassy driver discovered a device planted on the underside of his car. Within hours of the apparently co-ordinated attacks in the Indian and Georgian capitals, Netanyahu said: &quot;The elements behind these attacks were Iran and its protege, Hezbollah.&quot; Tehran, he added, was the largest exporter of terror in the world and was also responsible for recent attempted assaults on Israeli targets in Azerbaijan and Thailand. Israel, he said, would act with a strong hand. The foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said Israel &quot;know[s] how to identify exactly who is responsible for the attack and who carried it out&quot;. Iran described the accusations as &quot;sheer lies&quot;. Mehdi Nabizadeh, ambassador to Delhi, was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency in Iran as saying: &quot;Any terrorist attack is condemned [by Iran] and we strongly reject the untrue comments by an Israeli official.&quot; The modus operandi in both incidents mirrored the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran last month, which Iran claimed was carried out by agents for Israeli intelligence. The Iranians also blamed Israel for a string of earlier assassinations and covert operations. Many in the international community have voiced alarm at the prospect of a low-intensity war between the two states conducted by intelligence operatives and their proxies. Speculation that Israel is preparing for a military strike on Iran&apos;s nuclear installations has also grown. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attacks, which were initially linked to the anniversary of the assassination of a Hezbollah militant in Lebanon four years ago. Israel is working on the theory that Hezbollah carried out the attacks but with Iran&apos;s blessing. Four people, including the wife of an Israeli diplomat, were reported injured when an explosion wrecked a car which had a diplomatic number plate. According to BK Gupta, the Delhi police commissioner, the woman noticed a passing motorcyclist attach what appeared to be a magnetic device to the car when it slowed at a junction 300 metres from the Indian prime minister&apos;s heavily guarded residence, close to a military compound in the diplomatic quarter. There was a loud sound, an explosion and the car caught fire, he said. The woman, Tali Yehoshua-Koren, married to the Israeli defence attache, was taken to hospital for treatment and was expected to fly to Tel Aviv later. In Tbilisi, an explosive device was safely defused after being found under a car of a man employed as a driver at the Israeli embassy. Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, an Iranian nuclear scientist, was killed in Tehran a month ago when magnetic bombs were attached to the side of his car. He was the fourth scientist to be assassinated in two years. The Israeli ministry had warned missions internationally of attacks around the anniversary of the death of Imad Mughniyah, a senior Hezbollah figure killed in 2008. Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran, accused Israel of being responsible. High-ranking officials have also warned of the threat to Israeli targets from Iran or its allies. Yoram Cohen, the head of Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s internal security agency, said this month that Iranian agents were trying to attack Israeli targets around the world in retaliation for covert operations, including the killing of Iranian scientists. He cited &quot;three serious attacks&quot; in recent months thwarted &quot;on the verge of being carried out&quot; \u2013 in Istanbul, Baku and Bangkok.&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s true or not that Israel took out the nuclear scientists,&quot; he told a closed meeting, reported in the Haaretz newspaper. &quot;A major, serious country like Iran cannot let this go on. &quot; India has favourable relations with Iran and had said it would continue to buy oil despite sanctions by the US and other countries.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T07:51:00Z", "title": "Israel accuses Iran of attacks in Delhi and Tbilisi", "sentences": ["The woman, Tali Yehoshua-Koren, married to the Israeli defence attache, was taken to hospital for treatment and was expected to fly to Tel Aviv later."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/israel-accuses-iran-of-attacks"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Human trafficking", "Israel", "Torture", "Human rights"], "article": "     Hundreds of African refugees are being held hostage in the Sinai desert of Egypt by smugglers demanding up to $40,000 (\u00a325,000) each for their release, human rights workers have warned. A brutal trafficking industry has flourished over the past year in which Bedouin gangs, emboldened by their apparent impunity, extort higher and higher prices for kidnapped migrants. Most of the hostages are Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers who paid $3,000 each to the gangs to get them to the Israeli border. Instead, they are subjected to daily torture as their captors phone their relatives at home and abroad demanding huge sums to spare their lives. Asmerom (not his real name) receives 10 calls a day from a childhood friend, who is among 30 women and 12 men from Eritrea held in one Sinai camp. She contacts him because, unlike her family, he lives\u00a0in Israel and might have access to money. She tells him they are being starved, beaten and burned with electric cables. The 19-year-old&apos;s captors initially demanded $40,000 for each of the 42 hostages but after three weeks, dropped\u00a0the price to $30,000. The smugglers say\u00a0Asmerom, 20, needs to get the money to their agent in Israel quickly or they will kill her. &quot;They call me when they are beating her. Her hands and feet are tied so they put the phone up to her mouth while she is screaming,&quot; said Asmeron, clutching his phone in his hands. He looked aghast when it rings. &quot;I don&apos;t understand them, they&apos;re speaking Arabic. Listen, she keeps crying: &apos;Help me, help me.&apos; What can I do?&quot; Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), an Israeli NGO, say Asmerom has little choice but to try to raise the money. PHR runs a clinic in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, offering medical care\u00a0to asylum seekers and foreign workers\u00a0who, without official status in Israel, are ineligible for anything but emergency healthcare. Every year several thousand Africans, most of them from Eritrea and Sudan, try to get into Israel \u2013 something the Israelis are eager to halt. Over the past 18 months, PHR has interviewed 900 people who have been tortured in the Sinai, and have traced a human trafficking network that extends to the refugee camps in Sudan and Eritrea.\u00a0The NGO knows of at least 350 people being held\u00a0now. Its clinic in Jaffa is familiar with the injuries inflicted by these gangs. Torture methods include pouring hot plastic on victim&apos;s body, electric shocks, rape \u2013 including penetration with objects \u2013 and branding with hot irons. If these methods fail to extort enough cash, survivors say the smugglers either kill their hostages or sell their organs. &quot;We have heard of mass graves of hundreds of people,&quot; said Shahar Shoham, who heads PHR research into the Sinai torture camps. Mogos Redae, 33, was released last June after nine months. His family raised money to free him by selling their house and valuables. He is lucky to be alive. His captors would apply electric shocks to him and his fellow hostages in front of young children, encouraging the toddlers to laugh as the victims screamed in agony. Three men held with him died as a result of the beatings, one while he was shackled to Redae. &quot;We fell asleep huddled together but when they tried to wake him, he was dead,&quot; said Redae. &quot;They wrapped him in a bed sheet and threw him on the car, like garbage. They did this to me three times. They threw me to the car and then saw I was alive. &quot;Nobody stops you from calling whoever you want because they want the money. As long as the person you are calling is fruitful.&quot; After three weeks of phone calls, Asmerom could no longer bear listening to his friend&apos;s screams. He turned off his phone and started trying to raise the money. He contacted his friend&apos;s parents in Eritrea, who scrabbled to produce $17,000 by selling the family home. He has given all the money he can. So have his friends and even his employer \u2013 an elderly Israeli man he cares for three days a week. He now has $24,000, but it is not enough for the captors and he has exhausted all his options. &quot;I went to the police station in Jerusalem. I waited for five hours and I told them everything. They said come back when I&apos;ve raised all the money. They didn&apos;t tell me how to do that. Frankly, they didn&apos;t seem to care,&quot; Asmerom said. A spokesperson for the Israeli police said they were unable to comment on the case or any other without investigating each fully, while Israel&apos;s defence ministry said it would be inappropriate to comment on an internal Egyptian issue. A spokesperson for the Egyptian ministry of the interior claimed to have no information on trafficking or torture in the Sinai region. But Shoham said: &quot;We know the names of the smugglers and their locations. We have briefed the Egyptian embassy in Israel but so far the Egyptian authorities are not doing anything. &quot;It is the responsibility of the Egyptian government to stop the traffickers. It is also the responsibility of Israel to protect the victims, but instead the ransoms are getting higher and the stories of torture are getting worse.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T18:00:00Z", "title": "Sinai desert plagued by kidnap and torture \u2013 as the authorities bury their heads", "sentences": ["PHR runs a clinic in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, offering medical care\u00a0to asylum seekers and foreign workers\u00a0who, without official status in Israel, are ineligible for anything but emergency healthcare."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/egypt-bedouin-kidnap-refugees-israel"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Modern football is a dispiriting compromise of safety nets and second chances: the big teams are protected by seeding, play-offs, larger tournaments and consolation prizes like the Europa League (even if that is often greeted with an enthusiasm previously reserved for Bullseye contestants who were eyeing the speedboat and ended up with just their Bus Fare Home). The delicious cut-throat element of football has all but gone. For the big international sides, qualification for major tournaments has become such a formality that even Steve McClaren almost managed it. This was not always the case. A prime example is the qualification campaign for USA 94, the last before Uefa introduced play-offs. The final night of qualifying fixtures, 17 November 1993, was a sensory overload of authentic drama that included death, \u2018murder\u2019, robbery, illegal aliens \u2013 and Jack Charlton almost chinning Tony Cascarino. It was a night that defined the lives of Paul Bodin, Davide Gualtieri, Alan McLoughlin, David Ginola, Emil Kostadinov and Santiago Ca\u00f1izares. It also sparked one of football\u2019s most enduring feuds. Few dates in the football calendar have had such a brilliant ensemble cast. So many teams were fighting for their lives going into their last game, knowing that one false move and they would not be going to the World Cup. The only European sides to have qualified were Greece, Russia, Sweden and Norway, plus the holders Germany. The other eight places would be decided in nine fixtures; even Sky\u2019s red button would not have been big enough for a night like this. In these parts it is remembered as the night no British side qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1938, but that is only part of an amazing story. Holland, Spain, England, Italy, France and the European champions, Denmark, all had alarmingly good views from the precipice. Italy\u2019s night on the precipice We could start anywhere, but in the interest of chronology let\u2019s go for Group One, where Italy, Portugal and Roy Hodgson\u2019s Switzerland were competing for two places. Switzerland started the night in third but knew that a 2-0 win at home to Estonia, the group patsies, would guarantee qualification. That\u2019s because Italy and Portugal were meeting in Milan. They were level on points and goal difference, but Italy had a crucial advantage by virtue of having scored more goals. With Switzerland 99.94% certain to take care of business, it meant that Portugal had to win; Italy needed only a draw. The margins were thinner than a self-loathing supermodel: had Portugal won 4-0 at home to Estonia rather than 3-0 in their previous fixture, they could have settled for a draw in Milan. In Zurich, Switzerland cruised to a 4-0 win as expected. \u201cThis is the greatest day of my life,\u201d said Hodgson, doubtless to the delight of his wife. \u201cIt has crowned my coaching career.\u201d The real drama occurred in Milan. Italy had not even had to qualify for a World Cup for 12 years (they were holders in 1986 and hosts in 1990); now they were in danger of failing to qualify for the first time since 1958. Portugal, managed by Carlos Queiroz, were a smooth side who included Paulo Sousa, a young Rui Costa and the waspish genius of Paulo Futre. They played tiki-taka \u2013 or, as it was known back then, possession football. Portugal dominated possession in the first half, although Italy\u2019s largely Milanese defence were superb and the goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was never really forced to strain his sinews. Italy had an even share of the game in the second half after introducing first Demetrio Albertini and then Roberto Mancini. With seven minutes to go, however, they were still within one goal of ignominy. Then Dino Baggio scored a palpably offside goal to give them the lead, and it was all over for Portugal. Their misery was complete a minute from time when Fernando Couto was sent off for jabbing his hand into the face of Pierluigi Casiraghi, who collapsed in the risible style. \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a mistake by Pearce \u2026\u2019 That was not the only World Cup qualifier in Italy that night. In Bologna, San Marino hosted an England side who, as David Lacey wrote in this paper, suffered \u201cthe final, logical consequences of their own inadequacies\u201d. To qualify they had to beat San Marino by seven goals and hope that Poland won at home to Holland. England did score seven, but by far the most memorable goal of the night came at the other end. Before this game San Marino had only scored twice in international football, and averaged a goal every 48,600 seconds. Against England, they scored after 8.3 seconds when the little right-winger Davide Gualtieri pounced upon an absent-minded backpass from Stuart Pearce. This was a preposterous reversal of the habitual theme of Pearce letting his winger know he was around. It was the fastest goal in World Cup competition. To those who did not endure England\u2019s hapless but also unfortunate World Cup qualifying campaign under Graham Taylor, it is hard to fully explain the tragifarcical beauty of that moment. All future replays should be soundtracked by the theme from Curb Your Enthusiasm. Better, perhaps, to dwell on the happier side of things, for it changed Gualtieri\u2019s life. The video of the game acts as instant serotonin. \u201cYou know, sometimes if I\u2019m feeling a bit down, I\u2019ll play it again just to cheer myself up. It always works,\u201d he told the Evening Standard a decade later. When Scotland came to town in 1995, with many fans wearing T-shirts that read \u201cGUALTIERI, EIGHT SECONDS\u201d, he was accosted by the Tartan Army and forced to drink pints of Happy Memories until the small hours. Although a San Marino victory was never a serious prospect, it did take an increasingly agitated England more than 20 minutes to equalise. \u201cYou should have heard the language they used to each other,\u201d said Gualtieri. Eventually they scored seven, four of them from Ian Wright, which quintupled his tally for England. It all took place in the eeriest of atmospheres, with barely 2,000 spectators in a stadium that housed 45,000. Gualtieri\u2019s goal would have been even more famous had it denied England a place at the World Cup. But Holland, cheered on by an army of 15,000 fans who outnumbered the locals 10 to one, were comfortable 3-1 winners in Poland. It was 1-1 at half-time, which gave England a snifter of misplaced hope. Dennis Bergkamp, for whom international football was a sanctuary from his Milanese torment, defenestrated that hope with his second clinical finish of the night just before the hour. This was a seriously dark night for England, still the only time since the 1970s that they have failed to qualify for the World Cup. There was a hint of hope later that night, however; on Sportsnight, Des Lynam interrupted a familiar joust between Terry Venables and Jimmy Hill to ask Venables whether he might perhaps, y\u2019know, hypothetically, maybe be interested in the England job if it became available. Venables, normally so loquacious, suddenly became coy. At that stage he was an outsider for the job because of his problems with Alan Sugar, and when Graham Taylor quit a week later, Venables was a 25-1 outsider behind the likes of Steve Coppell, Mike Walker, Trevor and Gerry Francis, Joe Royle, Ray Wilkins and the favourite Howard Wilkinson. It soon become apparent that Venables was the outstanding choice, followed by daylight. A new day was coming, in which Venables\u2019 England would play football for grown-ups. It truly had been darkest before the dawn. Traversing the ring of ire We\u2019ve no idea where to start in Group Three, which was the epicentre of this epic night. Spain were to host Denmark in Seville, with Northern Ireland (long since out of the running) at home to the Republic in Belfast. The three sides could barely be split: Denmark were top with 18 points (goal difference +14, goals scored 15), a point ahead of Spain (17 points, goal difference +22, goals scored 26) and the Republic (17 points, goal difference +13, goals scored 18). A draw was enough for Denmark, while Spain and the Republic knew they had to win to ensure qualification but that they might get through with a draw (in Spain\u2019s case, a draw was enough if the Republic failed to win; in the Republic\u2019s case, a draw was enough if Spain and Denmark did not draw. The Republic were out if they lost; Spain were out if they lost unless the Republic also lost. Confused? Splendid.) The intensity of the Ireland match was exacerbated by the political climate of the time. The Troubles were at their height, and a month earlier 23 people had died in a series of shootings and bombings. There was much talk of moving the game away from Belfast to Old Trafford, Wembley or even Italy. Eventually the game went ahead as planned, but the Republic, to Jack Charlton\u2019s not inconsiderable chagrin, had to fly rather than drive for security reasons. The mood wasn\u2019t improved the day before the match when Billy Bingham \u2013 who was to retire after 17 years as Northern Ireland manager \u2013 laid into the Republic\u2019s \u201cmercenaries\u201d. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find a way of making it with England or Scotland,\u201d he said of players like Andy Townsend, Ray Houghton and John Aldridge. \u201cI take a totally cynical view of the whole business. I am not prepared to skirt the issue, the same as I am happy to state it is our intention to stuff the Republic.\u201d Ireland were given a taste of what was to come when they arrived for their last training session to be greeted by a group of 10- and 11-year-olds with erect middle fingers. When they arrived for the game, they found a ring of barbed wire and armed police. If there was a ring of steel outside the ground, then there was a ring of ire inside it. This was a maelstrom of hate, the sort of night on which even the gangsters look over their shoulder. Officially at least, the Republic had no supporters in the ground. \u201cI have never seen a more hostile atmosphere,\u201d said Jack Charlton, \u201cnot even in Turkey.\u201d Terry Phelan and Paul McGrath received monkey chants; Alan Kernaghan, who played for Northern Ireland at schoolboy level, was noisily called a \u201cfucking Lundy\u201d. And then there were the dogs, hundreds of them, or so it seemed, barking like they knew the apocalypse was coming. \u201cThe safest place to be,\u201d said McLoughlin, \u201cwas on the pitch.\u201d There was another advantage to being on the pitch: you could control your side\u2019s destiny. Spain\u2019s legendary keeper Andoni Zubizaretta lost that privilege when he was sent off in the 10th minute against Denmark. Zubizaretta passed the ball feebly to his Barcelona team-mate Michael Laudrup and then took him out on the edge of the box. The substitute keeper was Ca\u00f1izares, a 23-year-old who was making his international debut in a situation that was too much for a man making his 83rd appearance. Yet as he walked on to the pitch, Ca\u00f1izares went into a zone that he arguably did not enter for the rest of his career. With Denmark only needing a draw, they seemed to have nine toes in America. There was, however, one big catch: their opponents were Spain, the bogey side who had put the great Danish Dynamite side out of Euro 84 and Mexico 86, while also beating them at Euro 88. Against any other team Denmark would probably have regarded the red card as an almighty bonus. With it being Spain, however, they starting looking for booby traps, their subconscious probably wondering whether Zubizaretta\u2019s red card was all part of a warped hextension. Add in the fact that Denmark were most comfortable on the counter-attack \u2013 an approach that served them so well during their fairytale win at Euro 92 \u2013 and you had a confused broth. Denmark\u2019s extra man meant they inevitably controlled the first half, and created a couple of very good chances, but theirs was a kind of sterile domination, the result of an aggressive-passive approach. And with every Ca\u00f1izares save, an intoxicating cocktail of destiny and fatalism became ever more Spanish in flavour. It was also goalless in Belfast after a largely witless first half in which the Republic were comfortable but not incisive. (\u201cThe match,\u201d said Ken Jones in the Independent, \u201cnever rose above the level of perspiring mediocrity.\u201d) At that stage the Republic were going out, but the group changed when Spain took the lead in the 63rd minute. A corner from the right was driven beyond the far post, Jos\u00e9 Maria Bakero baulked Peter Schmeichel, and Fernando Hierro headed into the vacant net. Schmeichel was furious, and with good reason. \u201cOf course it was a foul,\u201d said Bakero years later. It was only the second goal Denmark had conceded in 10 qualifying games. \u201cIn my eyes it seemed like the referee regretted sending off Zubizaretta and started to give the Spanish a few favours,\u201d said Schmeichel after the match. Denmark pressed, but Spain drew strength from a raucous atmosphere at an intimidating venue where they played every qualifier between 1983 and 1995. At that stage Denmark were going out, but the \u2018as it stands\u2019 table changed again when, out of nothing, Jimmy Quinn scored a stunning volley for Northern Ireland in the 71st minute. Jimmy Nicholl, the Northern Ireland No2, celebrated with an up yours gesture at his Republic counterpart Maurice Setters. With the Republic now needing a goal, Jack Charlton turned to Tony Cascarino. There was one problem: Cascarino, for the only time in his career, had forgotten to put his kit on. When Cascarino unzipped his tracksuit top, all he saw was a plain cotton T-shirt. When Charlton asked what was keeping him, Cascarino informed him of the slight impediment to his introduction. \u201cHis face turned purple,\u201d said Cascarino. \u201cI thought he was going to have a heart attack. \u2018You fucccccking idiot!\u2019\u201d As with Gualtieri\u2019s goal, this was stratospheric farce. There was no time for this story to play out to its conclusion, because in the 76th minute the substitute McLoughlin brought the Republic level with a fine goal, chesting down a half-cleared free-kick and ramming it into the corner. An exhausted Charlton later said that McLoughlin had \u201cjustified his existence\u201d. He was also in Cascarino\u2019s good books for the rest of his days. \u201cI have always believed,\u201d said Cascarino, \u201cthat, had Alan McLoughlin not equalised \u2026 there\u2019s a fair chance Jack would have chinned me.\u201d The Republic pushed for a different kind of knockout blow, knowing they were out if Denmark equalised in Seville. Ca\u00f1izares made an unbelievable save from Bent Christensen (although this video suggests a foul had been given for a push by Christensen), and then Michael Laudrup drilled a long-range half-volley just wide. When the final whistle went in Belfast, the Republic celebrated in the mistaken belief that it was over in Seville and that they had qualified. Charlton thought the same as he walked down the tunnel, only to see a TV showing the last rites of Spain v Denmark. \u201cThe guy asked if I wanted it to watch it,\u201d said Charlton. \u201c\u2019Do I bollocks,\u2019 I said. Then he touched me on the shoulder and said: \u2018Now will you look?\u2019 And I did, and it had finished 1-0.\u201d The Republic and Denmark were level on points and goal difference. The Republic, who scored four goals in nine games at the World Cup under Charlton, were through by virtue of scoring more goals. In the feverish aftermath, Charlton decided to score a point. \u201cI spotted Billy [Bingham] talking among his players and moved in his direction to congratulate him on his retirement and compliment him on a good game,\u201d he said in his autobiography. \u201cAt least that was my intention. Instead, in a moment I still find difficult to understand, I pointed a finger at him and blurted \u2018Up yours too, Billy.\u2019\u201d Charlton regretted the words instantly, not least because it hadn\u2019t been Bingham who gestured at Setters in the first place, and apologised shortly after. A surreal night ended with Charlton presenting Bingham with an award to mark his retirement. \u201cSome of the people who\u2019d been abusing me all evening are stood there cheering. I think that said it all about a crazy, noisy night.\u201d There was no warm, fuzzy ending in Seville. \u201cWhen the final whistle blew,\u201d said the Denmark striker Flemming Povlsen, \u201cI cried with an anger every bit as intense as the joy I\u2019d felt the year before on winning the European Championship.\u201d This headline \u2013 which simply said \u2018ROBBERY\u2019 \u2013 summed up Denmark\u2019s feelings. For the first time in 16 years, the European champions had failed to qualify for the World Cup. Putting the \u2018Bodin\u2019 in \u2018foreboding\u2019 There is a nice moment in the 1984-85 edition of Match of the 80s when Andy Gray considers Everton\u2019s momentous 3-1 win over Bayern Munich in the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup semi-final. \u201cI played 600-700 games at professional level,\u201d he says wistfully. \u201cIf I could take one with me when I go, that\u2019d be the one.\u201d Not everybody gets to take the glory game with them. For most of the Wales team who had their hearts broken by Romania in 1993, this was the game they will remember forever. \u201cI played almost 850 matches as a pro,\u201d said Dean Saunders, \u201cbut that Romania match still lives on in my memory.\u201d In 2003, Gary Speed called it \u201cthe most painful match of my career. I was devastated by it, to be honest, and I wish I\u2019d handled it better because it affected me for a long time afterwards.\u201d Those were halcyon days for Wales. They were 28th in the Fifa world rankings, a position they have not achieved since, and they were the subject of rare goodwill before the game. They received hundreds of telegrams, including ones from John Major, Princess Diana, George Best and the Welsh Rugby Union, and many people in England were more bothered about their fate than that of England. The BBC even switched from the England match to Wales early in the second half. Terry Yorath, whose contract was due to expire the day after the game, had worked wonders with a motley crew, described in the Independent as a \u201chotch-potch of disparate talents\u201d. It\u2019s rare to see such a mixture of great players and journeymen. With Mark Hughes suspended, the team for the Romania match was Neville Southall, David Phillips, Eric Young, Andy Melville, Kit Symons, Paul Bodin, Barry Horne, Speed, Ryan Giggs, Ian Rush and Saunders. In another complex group, Wales needed to win by two to be certain of qualification, but any kind of win would do provided the RCS (Republic of Czechs and Slovaks) were not victorious away to Belgium. The RCS also needed a win to qualify, while Belgium and Romania required only a draw. Belgium held the RCS to a 0-0 draw in Brussels despite the sending off of Philippe Albert early in the second half; Wales, although they did not know it at that time, just needed a win. That was still an arduous task against a brilliant Romania side who had stuffed them 5-1 in the return fixture. The clash of styles could hardly have been greater. For once, it would have been offensive not to resort to stereotypes. This was a case of valiant endeavour against temperamental flair. Not that Wales were without talent, but the tension of the occasion \u2013 and an amazing atmosphere that mixed fear, pride and desire \u2013 inevitably led them to embrace more classically British qualities. After the game, a Romanian journalist asked Yorath, almost out of sympathy, \u201cWill you never change from kick and rush?\u201d Florin Raducioiu, the Romanian centre forward, said Giggs needed to escape English football to fulfil his talent. Wales so nearly achieved a monumental triumph of the human spirit, but Romania were much the classier side. Of course they were. In the first half Dan Petrescu hit the post from three yards and Ilie Dumitrescu smashed over the bar from 12 yards after an exhilarating counter-attack. Gheorghe Hagi was his usual influence, drifting in dangerously from the right flank to send a number of long-range shots high or wide. After one such effort, the peerless BBC commentator Barry Davies sounded a warning. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t found the accuracy but I must say it worries me that he\u2019s running at people and he\u2019s finding space.\u201d It seems truly absurd with hindsight, but at the time Hagi was playing in Serie B for Brescia, a stop-off between spells at Real Madrid and Barcelona. His superior class was not in doubt, despite that, and he punished Wales in the 32nd minute. Hagi took a familiar, sinuous route infield from the right and then, from 25 yards, drove a low shot that slithered under Neville Southall. In the build-up to the game Southall, 35, was telling anyone who would listen that he was as good as he had been 10 years earlier. He could not have picked a more inopportune time to make the biggest mistake of his magnificent international career. Wales\u2019s response was splendid, and they put fierce pressure on Romania either side of half-time through a number of set pieces. Young\u2019s looping header was tipped over acrobatically, then Melville\u2019s header was cleared off the line in first-half injury-time. Another set-piece brought the equaliser after an hour, when Saunders flicked the ball in from a couple of yards. Almost straight from the kick-off, Wales were given a penalty when Speed, by his own admission, went down easily after a tug from Petrescu. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always wondered is what would have happened had I stayed on my feet?\u201d said Speed in 2003. \u201cWould I have scored if I hadn\u2019t gone down? Would that have made the crucial difference and taken us to the World Cup finals?\u201d The BBC switched to the Wales game just as Bodin prepared to take the penalty. (Tediously, 32,000 people phoned up to complain, and you can just imagine the faux outrage on Twitter were it to happen nowadays.) He was an excellent penalty taker; six months earlier he had scored at Wembley to settle a crazy play-off final and put Swindon into the Premiership; he had scored three out of three for Wales. But this was a whole new level of pressure, the kind you don\u2019t imagine when you sign up to take penalties for your team. For so many people around the ground, he put the \u2018Bodin\u2019 in \u2018foreboding\u2019. He hammered the penalty against the bar. In 2007, Observer Sport Monthly judged it the 46th most heartbreaking moment in sport history. Wales continued to push forward, but something died in them in that moment, and Romania stealthily took control of the game once more. After a couple of near misses, Raducioiu slipped an 83rd-minute winner through Southall, who was arguably culpable again. Wales had lost at Cardiff Arms Park for the first time since 1910. A miserable evening became evening darker when, just after the final whistle, an elderly fan was struck in the neck and killed by a flare launched from the other side of the ground. \u201cAt first there was a feeling of disbelief, of numbness,\u201d said Yorath, who never managed Wales again. Within a year, Wales were a rabble, losing in Moldova and being thrashed 5-0 in Georgia. \u201cIt was only at about four in the morning in my hotel room that I sat down and started crying. I knew it had gone. All that work had been for nothing.\u201d The scapegoat, inevitably and harshly, was Bodin. He did not so much have his 15 minutes of fame as his 12 yards of infamy. Unlike with England\u2019s failures from the spot in the 1990s, there was no safety in numbers for Bodin, no Pizza Hut adverts. Just abuse from a load of pizza-faced idiots. \u201cAfter the game I can remember a group of students out in the streets of Cardiff giving me lots of abuse,\u201d said Bodin. \u201cBut thankfully that was the worst it got.\u201d He may not have read the interview in which Nicky Wire of the Manic Street Preachers called him a \u2018cunt\u2019. \u201cI became a better person for what happened,\u201d Bodin said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never lost my temper if anyone brings the subject up because it did happen.\u201d He is a sensible, dignified man who eventually found peace with what had happened. And then there were France At least Bodin can laugh about it now, as this video shows. David Ginola can\u2019t. It\u2019s 6,664 days since he was part of the France side that failed to qualify for USA 94, yet the fallout is still going on. The 2-1 defeat at home to Bulgaria sparked a bitter feud between the manager G\u00e9rard Houllier and David Ginola. It was reignited late last year when Houllier called Ginola \u201ca bastard\u201d in the book Coaches\u2019 Secrets; Ginola\u2019s response was to issue legal proceedings. It had all seemed so straightforward for France. To qualify, they needed only to win at home to Israel or draw at home to Bulgaria. Israel were the worst team in the group, and had not won a single game. France had beaten them 4-0 in Tel Aviv. France had also not lost a World Cup qualifier at home for 25 years. It was such a formality that nobody even bothered to ask whether the fat lady needed a lozenge. The magazine Le Sport sent a print run to newsstands with the simple headline \u2018QUALIFIED\u2019. After 82 minutes in Paris, France were 2-1 up, the second goal a majestic long-range curler from Ginola. But goals from a young Eyal Berkovic and Reuven Atar, both created by the marauding Ronnie Rosenthal, gave Israel a sensational smash-and-grab victory. Even then, it seemed only to have postponed the inevitable. A month later, France needed only a draw at home to an erratic Bulgaria. Eric Cantona hammered them ahead in the 31st minute, but Emil Kostadinov equalised six minutes later with a smart header from a corner. The second half passed in a blur of nailbiting and clockwatching, and before anyone knew it the clock read 89:42. Then Ginola, the substitute, eschewed the chance to keep the ball by the corner flag and instead launched a long cross towards Cantona. Sixteen seconds later, Bulgaria had scored. Luboslav Penev flicked a speculative pass over the top, and Kostadinov controlled it before scorching the ball in off the underside of the bar from a narrow angle. It was so unthinkable that the French TV caption read France 2-1 Bulgarie. The whole of France was in shock. Dider Deschamps, a tough man, was almost overwhelmed by anguish. It was an awesome finish from Kostadinov, who had no right scoring from that angle and even less right to be in the country. The same was true of Penev, the man who created the goal. For some reason, Bulgaria had forgotten to apply for visas for both men before the game. By the time they realised, it was too late to get them in time. But Borislav Mihailov and Georgi Georgiev, who both played for Mulhouse in France, knew of a border-post where security was not as tight as it might have been. The two men sneaked in and stayed at Georgiev\u2019s house before heading to Paris. It\u2019s fair to assume that Ginola has never been welcome in Houllier\u2019s house since, and vice versa. \u201cHe sent an Exocet missile through the heart of the team,\u201d said Houllier after the game. \u201cHe committed a crime against the team. I repeat: a crime against the team.\u201d Houllier has always denied suggestions that he called Ginola an \u201cassassin\u201d or \u201ca murderer\u201d. He did, however, call him a salaud (bastard) in a book last year. He also said \u201cI\u2019ll never say anything good about Ginola\u201d in Philippe Auclair\u2019s biography of Eric Cantona. Ginola\u2019s crime was not just to try to score a goal; in the buildup to the game he had complained to the press that Cantona and Jean-Pierre Papin were given preferential treatment by Houllier. Ginola was the darling of PSG, while Papin and Cantona were Marseille alumni. For much of the Bulgaria match, which was played in Paris, Papin and Cantona were booed. \u201cIt affects my personal life, my children, it affects a lot of things, it\u2019s intolerable,\u201d said Ginola a couple of years ago. \u201cNow it\u2019s enough. I\u2019m so sick of it. Until my death they are going to talk to me about this.\u201d He was not the only man whose career had its defining moment on 17 November 1993. \u2022 Rob Smyth is co-author of Jumpers For Goalposts: How Football Sold Its Soul", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T11:41:06Z", "title": "The forgotten story of \u2026 17 November 1993 | Rob Smyth", "sentences": ["France had beaten them 4-0 in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/15/forgotten-story-17-november-1993"}, {"tags": ["Holocaust", "Second world war", "The Mossad", "Israel", "Argentina", "Germany", "War crimes", "Europe", "World news", "Americas", "Law"], "article": "There is the comb, the cigarette holder and the house keys he had on him when he was captured; the needle used to sedate him during his abduction from Argentina to Israel; and the booth in which he sat during his trial. Israel&apos;s intelligence agency, the Mossad, has lifted a veil of secrecy to display publicly for the first time documents, equipment, artefacts and personal testimonies relating to the capture, abduction and trial of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal who was hanged in Israel almost 50 years ago. Operation Finale, an exhibition at the Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, is curated by a serving Mossad officer, who can only be named as Avner A. Ninety per cent of the material on display comes from the Mossad archives, the first time in the agency&apos;s history that it has opened its vaults. The exhibition includes espionage equipment, such as a camera hidden in a briefcase and items used to forge documents and number plates; the original Mossad file on Eichmann, handwritten on yellowing paper; and the booth in which he sat during his trial. It discloses that the target was identified by his ears. Eichmann was in charge of implementing Hitler&apos;s Final Solution for the Jewish people, in which six million people died. After the war he was captured by Allied forces but escaped and fled to Argentina. There, a Holocaust survivor whose daughter was dating Eichmann&apos;s son became suspicious about the identity of the boy&apos;s father, and Israeli intelligence was alerted. A complicated operation, involving about a dozen agents, most now dead, was prepared and executed in May 1960. Eichmann, who was living in Buenos Aires under the alias Ricardo Klement, was surreptitiously photographed and the images compared to those from his SS file. From the shape of his ears it was concluded that Eichmann and Klement were the same person. He was bundled into a car on his way home from work by a team of Mossad agents. One of them, Rafi Eitan, who attended last week&apos;s opening of the exhibition, described in video testimony what happened. &quot;Eichmann&apos;s head was in my lap,&quot; he said. The agent examined his body for known scars and said he felt ecstatic when he found them. Eichmann was taken to a safe house. Asked to identify himself, he first gave a German alias, then his Argentinian identity. On the third time of asking, he responded: &quot;I am Adolf Eichmann. This is indeed my name.&quot; Then, recalled Eitan, he asked for a glass of wine. An elaborate plan to spirit him out of he country without alerting the Argentinian authorities was put into action. An El Al plane brought an official Israeli delegation to Buenos Aires as a cover for taking the high-value target back. He was passed off as a sick airline employee, dressed in an El Al uniform and heavily sedated in a first class seat. Luba Volk, now in her 80s, played an unwitting part in the abduction. A former El Al employee who had relocated to Buenos Aires, she was contacted by the airline and asked to help secure documentation for the flight. She had no idea of its true purpose. After the news emerged of Eichmann&apos;s capture and removal from Argentina, Volk was forced to leave the country and return to Israel. &quot;My name was on all the documentation,&quot; she said, while visiting the exhibition this week. &quot;I was very proud I took part, but I had one great regret \u2013 that I didn&apos;t know what I was doing while I was doing it.&quot; Fifty years on, the exhibition illustrates what now appears to be primitive methods of espionage. There were no computers on which to store and cross-reference information or create forged documents; no means of communication between agents on the ground; and little surveillance at Buenos Aires airport, either of the Mossad agents bringing bulky equipment in battered suitcases or of Eichmann being smuggled out of the country. David Ben-Gurion, Israel&apos;s first prime minister, announced the capture to the Israeli parliament and a stunned world. Eichmann was charged with 15 counts of crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity, war crimes and membership of a hostile organisation. After a trial lasting eight months, during which 99 Holocaust survivors gave evidence, Eichmann was sentenced to death and hanged on 31 May 1962 \u2013 the only time in Israel&apos;s history that the death penalty has been enacted. His body was cremated and the ashes scattered at sea, beyond Israel&apos;s territorial waters. Avinoam Armoni, the museum&apos;s director, said the episode was crucial in shaping Israel&apos;s identity. &quot;Until the Eichmann trial no one [in Israel] really spoke about the horrors of the Holocaust. Many survivors kept silent, even to their children,&quot; he said. The trial had been a life-changing event for people like him, born immediately after the war. &quot;It was like a dam opening. I remember sitting, glued to the radio. I grew up saying I&apos;m not a Jew, I&apos;m an Israeli \u2013 and suddenly we were confronted with this story.&quot; The exhibition, he hoped, would help to keep the story in the collective consciousness of the Israeli people. Micky Goldman, an Auschwitz survivor who became a policeman in the new state of Israel, joined the investigation unit which gathered evidence against Eichmann. He also testified at the trial and witnessed Eichman&apos;s execution. &quot;I had no grudge against him,&quot; he said in video testimony for the exhibition. &quot;I knew back then and I know it to this day that a human being cannot avenge what the Germans had done to us. I perceived him as a tool through which I could learn the truth about the Holocaust. Apart from that, he was nothing to me. He, who sent me to Auschwitz.&quot; The exhibition has had an unbelievable response since opening last week, Armoni said. After it ends in April, the organisers hope to take it abroad. Avner A, the curator with 25 years service as a Mossad agent, says the story is still incomplete. &quot;Every day I find something new, often from small stories of people coming to see the exhibition,&quot; he said. &quot;My role is to find all these small pieces and put them together. I am still investigating. We still don&apos;t have the whole story. But this is as close as we can get.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T16:20:47Z", "title": "Adolf Eichmann's capture, as told by the Mossad, in Israel exhibition", "sentences": ["Operation Finale, an exhibition at the Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, is curated by a serving Mossad officer, who can only be named as Avner A.

What would be the motive? The argument that Iran is retaliating for the murder of five civilian nuclear scientists in Iran is not plausible. If Iran wanted to target Israeli interests, it has other means at its disposal. It is hard to imagine that the Iranian government would send Iranian operatives to friendly countries, completely equipped with Iranian money and passports \u2013 making the case against them as obvious as possible. If the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are as professional, highly trained and politically savvy as we have been told repeatedly by Israeli politicians themselves, if they have successfully trained and equipped the cadres of Hezbollah and other movements with paramilitary wings in the region, then why would they launch such a clumsy and self-defeating operation? And why India, Georgia and Thailand, three countries that Iran has had cordial relations with during a period when Iran is facing increasing sanctions spearheaded by the United States? A few days ago, India agreed a rupee-based oil and gas deal with Iran and resisted US pressures to join the western boycott of the Iranian energy sector. As a net importer of 12% of Iranian oil, India&apos;s total trade with Iran amounted to $13.67bn in 2010-2011. What would be the motive for damaging relations with one of Iran&apos;s major trading partners and regional heavyweights? For Iran it doesn&apos;t make sense to risk alienating India by launching an assassination attempt in the capital of the country. Similarly, Iran has good economic and political relations with Georgia and Thailand. Why would the leadership in Tehran risk a major crisis with these countries during this sensitive period when IAEA inspectors are moving in and out of Iran to investigate the country&apos;s nuclear programme? The true answer is that at this stage no one knows for sure who is behind the attacks. There have been news reports that the security agencies in India are examining the similarities between the explosion in Delhi and the Jama Masjid shooting and blast in 2010 when similar methods were used. According to these reports, the culprits could be the so-called Indian Mujahideen, which is unrelated to Iran and which is opposed to India&apos;s relations with Israel. There are several other such groups that support the Palestinian cause and that have targeted India before. It is politics that will prevail over the truth in this case; the Netanyahu administration will attempt to exploit the situation in order to make the case for increasing sanctions against Iran. Undoubtedly, it will attempt to derail Iranian-Indian relations, which has been a primary objective of the administration&apos;s grand strategy to isolate Iran. For the Netanyahu administration, the culprit of these attacks has to be the Iranian government, irrespective of the truth, because it is politically expedient to represent the country as an existential threat in order to hype up the nuclear issue and to divert attention away from the Palestinian question. Certainly, on the fringes of the Israeli right wing the drumbeats for war will beat louder. The Iranian government, on the other hand, will continue to deny any involvement in order to ward off a diplomatic fallout. Iran is not interested in any military confrontation. But at the same time Israel is a convenient bogeyman for Iran&apos;s own right wing. Cyclical, confined confrontation with Israel is politically useful in order to foster support for the country&apos;s policies, both domestically and in the wider Arab and Islamic world. Finally, the international community, including the Obama administration, is likely to contain the repercussions of what happened in order to give diplomacy a chance, and to cool down the hawks in Tel Aviv. We are in the middle of the realm of politics then, not the truth. Apart from a tiny minority that is tied to the military industrial complex, no one really has a penchant for yet another disastrous war in the Islamic world. One thing is certain, however. If the current cold war between Israel and Iran is not managed diplomatically sooner rather than later, the tensions will continue to rise with potentially devastating consequences for Israelis and Iranians alike. Policies of terror and intimidation yield wars; diplomacy and dialogue yield peace and stability. It is time that this fundamental logic of international politics is enforced in west Asia and north Africa. To that end, the case for reconciliation has to be made continuously and emphatically, especially during periods of massive rage and trepidation. We are exactly at such a decisive juncture. It is all the more imperative then that intellectual acumen and analytical sobriety prevail over the resurgent pro-war lobby. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T20:00:00Z", "title": "Iran seems an unlikely culprit for the attacks on Israeli diplomats | Arshin Adib-Moghaddam", "sentences": ["Finally, the international community, including the Obama administration, is likely to contain the repercussions of what happened in order to give diplomacy a chance, and to cool down the hawks in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/15/iran-israeli-diplomats-attacks"}, {"tags": ["Death and dying", "Life and style"], "article": "&quot;Life is a disease with 100% mortality,&quot; says the suicide shrink Dr Pomerantz in a new Israeli film of the same name that premiered over the weekend in Tel Aviv. It&apos;s a similar message given out by the Catholic church today on Ash Wednesday as believers are marked on the forehead with the ashes of their own mortality and reminded by the priest: &quot;Know that you are dust and to dust you shall return.&quot; But art-house cinema and the Catholic church are two of the very few places where death remains part of the public conversation. Elsewhere, death is camouflaged by fluffy euphemisms like &quot;passing away&quot; or &quot;falling asleep&quot;, or otherwise approached with detachment through the scientific discourse of medicine. Long before the present government dreamt up its latest reforms to the NHS, death itself had been culturally privatised. These days, if we are asked how we want to die, we generally say that we want it to happen quickly, painlessly and preferably in our sleep. In other words, we don&apos;t want dying to become something we experience as a part of life. This would have made little sense to generations past. For centuries, what was feared most was &quot;dying unprepared&quot;. Death was an opportunity to put things right. To say the things that had been left unsaid: &quot;Sorry&quot;, &quot;I was wrong&quot;, &quot;I always loved you&quot;. We used to die surrounded by our extended family. Now we die surrounded by technology, with a belief in medical science often replacing the traditional puzzle of human existence. Even as a brute biological fact, death poses us all, religious and non-religious alike, with the question of what life is all about. For some this quickly becomes a theological matter, for others a challenge not to waste the rest of our lives. But where death is squeezed out of the public realm, that question no longer has the same urgency. There are more down-to-earth consequences, too. A culture that keeps death out of sight and mind is one that is increasingly lost for words when comforting others in their grief. Instead of having that important conversation in the supermarket with the lady down the street who has lost her husband, we slip down the next aisle with the self-justifying thought that we do not want to disturb her. Elsewhere, we allow our care homes for the elderly to become places of neglect because we do not want to look too closely. Where death becomes a private matter, it becomes so much more difficult to reach out to others precisely when they need it most. Those who give things up for Lent often use it as a time for cheery self-improvement. Priests and existentialist Israeli film directors will not agree on the answers to life&apos;s questions, but they share the view that we cannot resolve the meaning of life by not asking the question of death.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-21T23:57:23Z", "title": "Ash Wednesday: the lost art of dying | Editorial", "sentences": ["&quot;Life is a disease with 100% mortality,&quot; says the suicide shrink Dr Pomerantz in a new Israeli film of the same name that premiered over the weekend in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/21/ash-wednesday-lost-art-of-dying-editorial"}, {"tags": ["Facebook", "Games", "Apps", "Social networking", "Social media", "Media", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Culture"], "article": "Facebook is creating a dedicated gaming team in Europe, matching the one it has in the US, to work more closely with social games developers across Europe. &quot;In the US, we have a team of engineers, product managers and partnerships folks who only do gaming, from Zynga down to two-person shops. Now we&apos;re creating that same unit in Europe too,&quot; says Christian Hernandez, director of EMEA director of business development and partnerships at Facebook. The move is the result of the recent success for several European social games companies on Facebook, including Wooga, King.com, Supercell and Nordeus. Hernandez says these companies have all managed to build healthy audiences on the social network by focusing on different kinds of games to giants like Zynga. &quot;We&apos;re in the third generation of the Facebook platform for gaming,&quot; says Hernandez. The first generation was a &quot;mad scramble for what the heck this platform was, with not-very high-quality games&quot;, while the second generation was focused on world-building games like FarmVille, and competitive social/casual titles like brain training. &quot;Now we&apos;re in the third evolution of the gaming platform, as the world-building and social/casual space has begun to consolidate,&quot; says Hernandez. &quot;Newer players are coming into untapped areas and satisfying new types of users, who don&apos;t want to play FarmVille but might want to play strategy or shooter games, or free games around jackpot, slots or blackjack.

And Wooga came onto the platform after Zynga was big, but focused very specifically on social casual games, and managed to become the number two player on the platform \u2013\u00a0all from Berlin, rather than from Silicon Valley.&quot; Hernandez believes that Europe is &quot;the most interesting region in terms of the innovation on top of the Facebook platform in gaming&quot;, although he adds that his job would hardly allow him to think otherwise. A recent report from Deloitte claimed that Facebook&apos;s app economy had generated \u00a3467m of economic activity in the UK, and created 7,000 jobs. He adds that Wooga is also a good example of a company competing with the likes of Zynga not through a barrage of Facebook ads, but through organic growth and user referrals. In February, the company&apos;s chief executive Jens Begemann said that only 5% of its new users come through paid ads, with 40% coming through viral features and the remainder from cross-promotions in Wooga&apos;s existing games. Mobile will be a big focus for Facebook&apos;s new European games team, bolstered by the company&apos;s extension of its applications platform to mobile devices in October 2011. People can now discover games through Facebook&apos;s mobile apps and website, while developers can make money from in-game transactions across web and mobile, using a combination of Facebook Credits and native in-app purchases. &quot;You&apos;ll see a lot of investment from us in teaching developers how to use those channels in mobile,&quot; says Hernandez. &quot;In March we&apos;re bringing a group of engineers across and doing a tour of Europe around just the mobile platform, and how to build great apps with it. We&apos;ll have 250-300 people per event in three of the most interesting hubs for gaming in Europe: Stockholm, London and Tel Aviv.&quot; Rovio&apos;s launch of Angry Birds on Facebook has been an important moment for the social network, not least because the company put more effort in than simply porting its game across and wrapping leaderboards around it. Angry Birds&apos; Facebook incarnation features new power-ups \u2013\u00a0earned, gifted or bought \u2013\u00a0as well as features designed to spark competition between friends playing the game. A week after its release, it already has 1.5m monthly active users (MAUs) and 530,000 daily active users (DAUs). &quot;We spent a lot of time working with them,&quot; says Hernandez. &quot;A key focus is adding new layers of conversation around the game, to generate stories \u2013\u00a0whether that&apos;s &apos;Christian just got three stars on this level&apos;, &apos;Christian just beat your score&apos; or &apos;Christian invoked the Mighty Eagle on this level&apos;.&quot; What areas are still under-targeted in Facebook gaming? Hernandez suggests watching the combination of &quot;commerce and gaming&quot; \u2013\u00a0titles using game mechanics to make online shopping more fun and social. &quot;There&apos;s one startup based in Birmingham building a very girl-centric game called Fantasy Shopper, around building your own store, and going shopping effectively with fake money for real goods,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s an interesting dynamic: teenage girls going and actually building an interest board around what they&apos;d like to buy, even though they don&apos;t have the money. And then they can do special offers around that.&quot; How about branded social games? Agency BBH has launched a division to make social games with the company behind lollipop brand Chupa Chups, for example. Are we likely to see more of this kind of thing? &quot;We&apos;ve seen it on and off, where brands want to build social dynamics into some of their campaigns. The question is whether it is really going to be a game,&quot; he says. &quot;FarmVille and other titles are still quite strong, but how do you really do that with a brand? What game would lead you to come back over and over again, so the brand becomes a permanent fixture of your life, as opposed to just a launch campaign?&quot; The message coming from Hernandez and Facebook is clear though: the social network is very keen to convince developers that its platform is not a closed shop, off limits to new startups due to the marketing might of dominant publishers like Zynga. &quot;As a gaming platform we&apos;re just getting started,&quot; he says. &quot;Companies that came onto the platform fairly recently have become very popular very quickly, because they focused on the users and distribution channels. I still think there&apos;s a big opportunity for others to come in.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T17:45:00Z", "title": "Facebook builds European social games team following startups' success", "sentences": ["We&apos;ll have 250-300 people per event in three of the most interesting hubs for gaming in Europe: Stockholm, London and Tel Aviv.&quot; Rovio&apos;s launch of Angry Birds on Facebook has been an important moment for the social network, not least because the company put more effort in than simply porting its game across and wrapping leaderboards around it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/feb/22/facebook-games-europe"}, {"tags": ["Afghanistan", "Judaism", "Islam", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "I was at primary school in Kabul during the Soviet occupation. One day, seemingly out of the blue, a Muslim girl started a campaign of fear and slander against our only Jewish classmate. She declared that the latter came from a morally loose household and incited us to ostracise the quiet blonde girl. As far as we could see, there was nothing outwardly immoral about this exceptionally smart girl who already kept herself to herself. We asked the inciter to explain her accusation and she responded: &quot;Her mother lets in a complete stranger, a man, into their house every Sabbath!&quot; The understanding was that no decent Afghan woman would allow a strange man into her home, especially if she was a widow with no grownup son to protect her honour. This example of ignorance breeding cruelty took place at the honeymoon stage of the Afghan flirtation with jihad \u2013 before the mass romance with God&apos;s soldiers turned into gang rape. Looking now at old photographs of family life, religious classrooms and bar mitzvahs, the similarities between Muslim and Jewish Afghans are striking. The rabbis&apos; beards, turbans and gowns made them almost indistinguishable from Muslim scholars, while both were referred to by the title of mullah. The community shared with the rest of society a profound mistrust of state interference in family affairs, rejecting secular education and military service. In the 1920s, Jewish rabbis famously protested against Kabul&apos;s attempt to enlist Jewish children to state school. Much like the rest of society, the family structure was patriarchal. Jewish women married young, were deprived of education and led domestic lives away from the public eye. When leaving home, they covered themselves just like their Muslim counterparts. Such resistance to change meant that the community remained conspicuously traditional and closely knit together, marrying only among themselves. In the later decades, when Jewish children started to attend state schools, they had no choice but to turn up to classes on Sabbath. They dealt with this problem by simply sitting down but not doing much else. But this religious tolerance was already disappearing by the time of the Soviet occupation, when I had my own first-hand experience. But I learned later that my experience of Afghan intolerance of Jews was far from representative. From a historical perspective, the story of the Afghan Jews is a tale of remarkable tolerance. It may seem hard to believe today, but historically it was Afghanistan to which Jews turned to when escaping religious persecution in Iran and central Asia. It was in the dusty, ancient cities of Herat and Kabul, to the west and the east of Afghanistan, that they found freedom to practise their faith without getting murdered in the process. A community of leather and karakul merchants, poor people and money lenders alike, the large Jewish families mostly lived in the border city of Herat, while the families&apos; patriarchs travelled back and forth on trading trips, moving between Iran, Afghanistan, India and central Asia on the ancient silk road. The Jews did not engage in farming, which restricted their means of earning a living. Like many other Afghans, they survived through trade, taking lengthy and often dangerous trips across the majestic mountains on whose rocks their prayers were carved in Hebrew and sometimes even Aramaic. Like the rest of the population, the Jews of Afghanistan were simultaneously local and transnational, rooted to the Afghan soil by birth and burial but connected to a global faith through religion. Like Afghan Hindus and Muslims, their sacred sites, too, were located in faraway, hard-to-reach places while their holy language was not the official language of the nation. Isolated and yet connected through the invisible ties of spirituality, Afghan Jews were much like the rest of Afghans, sharing with the Sunni Pashtuns in particular a belief in being descended from the biblical lost tribes. Such similarities were ultimately why a peaceful coexistence was possible between Jewish and Muslim Afghans for most of their shared history, which dates back to the medieval times. The Afghans&apos; isolation from the rest of the world was a blessing in disguise for the Jewish community because being cut off from global political trends meant that ordinary Afghans were untouched by the raging, European-led, antisemitism of the early 20th century. Even at the height of the Nazi influence in Kabul of the 1930s, it was Afghan nationalism rather than antisemitism that led the government to introduce economic measures that bankrupted Jewish money-lending families. The laws affecting the Jewish community were soon removed and in the following decades Afghanistan was the only Muslim country that allowed Jewish families to immigrate without revoking their citizenship first. When Afghan Jews left the country en masse in the 1960s, their exile to New York and Tel Aviv was motivated by a search for a better life but not because of religious persecution. Like most Afghans, the Jewish community was also polyglot, reading Hebrew and speaking the local language as well as their own Judeo-Persian dialect. Largely illiterate, the community transmitted knowledge and wisdom through oral folktales, the Kafkaesque surreal characters and narratives of which are much like other Afghan folktales. A brutal truth of the cruelty of life in Afghanistan, for example, is summed up at the end of the Jewish folktale Moses and the Ants: &quot;When the fire rages in the wood, it burns the bad trees and the good.&quot; Now all are burned. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T08:59:00Z", "title": "The story of the Afghan Jews is one of remarkable tolerance | Nushin Arbabzadah", "sentences": ["When Afghan Jews left the country en masse in the 1960s, their exile to New York and Tel Aviv was motivated by a search for a better life but not because of religious persecution."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/feb/28/afghan-jews-tolerance"}, {"tags": ["Religion", "World news", "Christianity", "Judaism"], "article": "The supposedly &quot;sensational&quot; findings of an Ipsos Mori poll for the Richard Dawkins Foundation \u2013 that many self-styled Christians in the Church of England do not believe that Jesus was physically resurrected or was the Son of God; rarely pray; cannot name the four gospels in correct order; and seek moral guidance elsewhere than from religion \u2013 will be no surprise to those of us who work within Christianity&apos;s mother faith of Judaism. My guess is that the numbers would be even higher for Jewish (lack of) belief. Jews today are an overwhelmingly secular people, whether in Israel or the Diaspora. It is one of the issues I address in my new book. Traditionally, Jewish thought revolved around the three pillars of God, Torah and the people of Israel. Nowadays they are antisemitism, the Holocaust and the state of Israel. Aside from the devoutly pious fringe sects of Judaism, hardly any Jew today gives literal credence to a God who came down on Mount Sinai to give Moses the law for his chosen people, Israel; who is the omnipotent, omniscient creator and rules his creation with perfect justice; and who is guiding history, whatever its terrible vicissitudes along the way, towards a messianic age of peace and harmony when all peoples will acknowledge his sovereignty and do his will. A moment&apos;s reflection on the suffering, pain, injustice and sheer arbitrariness of human existence in what Thomas Hardy called &quot;this nonchalant universe&quot; makes it difficult for any thinking person to defend the notion of an all-beneficent or all-powerful creator. And even Jews who claim they believe in God resort to metaphor and woolly thought \u2013 a sense of wonder at nature, the &quot;still,\u00a0small voice&quot; of conscience, the &quot;divinely inspired&quot; genius of Mozart, a universe too intricately intermeshed not to have had a guiding hand behind it \u2013 when trying to explain why they believe. So what makes all those Jews who would define themselves as non-believers or predominantly secular still call themselves Jewish? The answer lies in something additional to faith and summed up as &quot;Jewish values&quot;. The 4,000-year-old link that a modern Jew in Tel Aviv, New York or London traces back to the biblical Abraham might be genetically fanciful, but it and the national narrative that evolved from it in all its infinite variety, customs, folk memories, intellectual and artistic efflorescence, tragedies and creative achievements still have the power to retain the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of men and women in the world today who classify themselves as Jewish. That is the legacy of a tradition that binds together the heirs of Judaism&apos;s diffuse culture, in which religion is a major component but not the only one. Adherents can choose where and how they wish to opt in, what on the menu takes their fancy, and those dishes they would rather avoid, including, for many, the chef&apos;s religious recommendations. Rejecting Judaism&apos;s beliefs would have been shocking in the past; less so today. Modern Jewish identity is fluid and pick&apos;n&apos;mix. Moral exhortations about justice, loving your neighbour and improving the world were originally religion-based but have become normative secular values among all Jews since emancipation and our entry into wider society. Parochial belief may have declined, but awareness has grown in Judaism of the need to work towards a universally endorsed secular ethic for healing the world. The same is true in Christianity, which is why I think the values of the two religions will survive \u2013 even without affirmations of belief from their followers.", "publicationDate": "2012-03-02T19:00:00Z", "title": "Face to faith: Can Jewish and Christian values survive without belief in an omnipotent God?", "sentences": ["The 4,000-year-old link that a modern Jew in Tel Aviv, New York or London traces back to the biblical Abraham might be genetically fanciful, but it and the national narrative that evolved from it in all its infinite variety, customs, folk memories, intellectual and artistic efflorescence, tragedies and creative achievements still have the power to retain the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of men and women in the world today who classify themselves as Jewish."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/mar/02/jewish-christian-values-survival"}, {"tags": ["Short stories", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Judaism", "Israel"], "article": "You wouldn&apos;t mistake an Etgar Keret short story for the work of anyone else. A typical piece will run to just a few pages, will be colloquial in style, and will juxtapose everyday life with some bizarre turn of events. In &quot;Unzipping&quot;, from his new collection Suddenly, a Knock on the Door (his first for 10 years), a woman discovers, while her boyfriend is sleeping, a &quot;teensy zip&quot; under his tongue: &quot;When she pulled at it, her whole Tsiki opened up like an oyster and inside was Jurgen.&quot; In &quot;Pudding&quot;, a man is dragged from his home by thugs, stripped, dressed in school uniform and then deposited at his parents&apos; house, whereupon he finds he has regressed to his childhood. Keret&apos;s stories often read like bar-room anecdotes or surreal jokes that break off before their punchlines. They are at once sophisticated and anti-literary, extremely funny and slyly serious. While invariably set in contemporary Israel, and full of sex and violence, they also hark back to older storytelling traditions, such as the parable, the folk tale and the absurdist fictions of Gogol and Kafka. Keret, who was born in 1967 and grew up in Tel Aviv, is sometimes described as being at the forefront of a &quot;new&quot; kind of Israeli writing, one that eschews head-on engagement with politics. While the region&apos;s turmoil saturates his work, his stories convey no clear message or ideological position. Keret explains this by telling me that, as a writer, he feels more Jewish than Israeli. &quot;Most of the Jewish writer friends I have are American and I feel closer to them because they&apos;re always obsessed with one issue \u2013 identity: what does it mean to be an American Jew?&quot; Israelis, he says, rarely deal with the question of what it means to be Israeli. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s too difficult, but they tend to suppress it. There is something about Jewish writing that&apos;s very reflective, while Israeli writing is more active and epic in nature.&quot; Keret attributes his adherence to a Jewish outlook to the fact that he grew up with a &quot;dual identity&quot;: a sense of being European as well as Israeli. &quot;I&apos;m the son of Holocaust survivors. It was important for my parents to pass as Israeli-born Jews. But when I would go to sleep, my mum would recite Polish poems and they would listen to Wagner.&quot; In person, Keret is relaxed, charming and very funny. Spending time with him is like entering the world of his stories: suddenly, everything seems slightly off-kilter, full of comic potential. We meet at a private members&apos; club, and before we sit down there&apos;s some kerfuffle over tables. &quot;People are so territorial here,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s worse than the Middle East.&quot; Keret says that stories often begin for him with an observation: a scene on a street, a snatch of conversation. &quot;I don&apos;t think in terms of ideas. I have some sort of starting point. And I never know where the story is heading.&quot; He likens the process to driving: &quot;The first thing I have to do is press the gas pedal and take my hands off the wheel. If I crash, maybe I&apos;ll get to somewhere interesting. It can&apos;t be premeditated.&quot; One of the funniest stories in Keret&apos;s new collection is &quot;Actually, I&apos;ve Had Some Phenomenal Hard-Ons Lately&quot;, about a businessman who&apos;s having an affair with a colleague. The thing that satisfies the man most about this arrangement is that, when he takes his mistress for a &quot;candlelit dinner&quot;, the cost is tax-deductible. Keret says the story was triggered by overhearing someone use the title phrase in a cafe. &quot;It struck me as such an amazing sentence. What&apos;s interesting is the word &apos;actually&apos; and the word &apos;hard-on&apos; used together. Because there&apos;s something about &apos;hard-on&apos; that&apos;s so primal, so instinctive, while &apos;actually&apos; is such a meta, linguistic kind of word.&quot; The resulting story was a kind of imaginative working out of this clash. &quot;The cheating is the &apos;hard-on&apos; bit, while the tax is the &apos;actually&apos;,&quot; he explains. Suddenly, a Knock on the Door took a decade to write, partly because of Keret&apos;s increasing involvement with the world of film and partly due to writer&apos;s block. &quot;What happened was that my life changed a lot: I got married, I had a kid, a mortgage. I kept having ideas for stories, but they were about bachelors living in a dirty apartments, trying to get laid.&quot; It took time, he says, to find a way to write that was relevant to his new circumstances. Although Keret now makes light of this period of non-productivity (&quot;The funny thing was that no one gave a fuck&quot;), the title story of his new collection is eloquent testament to how difficult it must have been. It describes a writer being held hostage in his living room by a gunman, a pollster and a pizza delivery man, all clamouring for him to tell them a story. The writer can&apos;t think of any opening, other than: &quot;It began with a knock on the door.&quot; The story is vintage Keret, a parable about creativity that blends his travails with larger questions about the status of writers in Israel.

Degania has changed since she was a child and there is now more individual freedom. &quot;The kibbutz doesn&apos;t tell you how to live your life any more,&quot; she says. It&apos;s a good thing, she adds; the world has changed and Degania has changed with it. &quot;You can&apos;t stay still.&quot; She and her non-kibbutznik husband, Shay, decided to stay at Degania to raise their family amid the security of kibbutz life. &quot;The community holds you together,&quot; says Sigal. The kibbutz movement &quot;symbolises what is best about Israel,&quot; says Shay. The family watched last year&apos;s nationwide demonstrations demanding social justice, knowing that &quot;it already exists here&quot;. Both say that national security is the most important issue facing Israel. At the start of the Arab spring, they welcomed the calls for freedom and democracy but now fear the rise of the &quot;fundamental Islamism&quot; in the region \u2013 which they describe as a &quot;crazy neighbourhood&quot;. The Syrian border is not far from Degania, and they are worried about the outcome of the uprising there. But Iran is the biggest threat, says Shay. &quot;[Ahmadinejad] is not a crazy guy \u2013 he is very clear about his intention, and very soon he will get the tools to make practical his ideology. The issue of survival should belong to the era of the Holocaust, but now Israel is again talking about it,&quot; he says, adding that the issue is &quot;not only for Israel but for the entire democratic world&quot;. The couple have four boys, aged from 23 years to 21 months. &quot;Four sons \u2013 four soldiers,&quot; Sigal says ruefully. The eldest, Shahaf, has completed his three-year military service; Snir, 20, will start his this month. &quot;It&apos;s not easy for me to send my boys to the army, but it&apos;s something we must do to defend our country,&quot; says Sigal. &quot;It&apos;s not something you want as a mother, that your son will fight, but it has to be done.&quot; &quot;This is the meaning and the reality of being Israeli,&quot; adds Shay. He points out that 90% of young people living on kibbutzim serve in the army, compared to only 50% living in Tel Aviv. &quot;It&apos;s part of our sense of public duty.&quot; Snir, who has been accepted into an elite combat unit, says: &quot;I grew up in an environment that gives me the feeling it is an honour to go to the army. My parents and grandparents served their country. I&apos;m very proud to be Israeli, it&apos;s a special country. People outside only see the bad things, but there are many more good things.&quot; Both he and his older brother insist the Israeli army has strong humanitarian principles, but its first duty is to protect Israeli citizens. The Shoshanys have encouraged their children and their community to have contact with Palestinians to overcome mutual suspicions and stereotypes. &quot;It&apos;s possible to live here without being connected to the issue of the Palestinians \u2013 apart from through the army,&quot; says Sigal. They are in favour of a two-state solution based on 1967 borders. The couple are proud of what Israel has achieved in almost 64 years. &quot;It&apos;s a kind of miracle \u2013 what we have done in the fields of medicine, agriculture and the economy,&quot; says Shay. &quot;If we could be at peace, it could be a paradise.&quot; THE RABBI NAME Moshe Weiss AGE: 52  OCCUPATION: businessman  LIVES: Jerusalem FAMILY: married, 10 children, seven grandchildren RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: ultra-orthodox Jewish Rabbi Moshe Weiss, born in New York to Holocaust survivors from Hungary, came to Israel at the age of 18. &quot;I grew up in a home which was haredi [ultra-orthodox] but my father was a passionate Zionist. For us, the state of Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people after thousands of years of exile and a place where Jewish people with all their dimensions finally have a home.&quot; Weiss originally came to study for a year in a yeshiva, a religious school. &quot;I was going to become a corporate lawyer or an architect, but I fell in love with the country. I wanted to be part of Jewish history.&quot; Now he runs a hi-tech company, Netspark, which filters internet content. The most important issue facing Israel is, he says, the security threat, especially from Iran which is &quot;threatening to wipe us off the map&quot;. He hopes for peace with the Palestinians, but fears &quot;the extremists among them are fighting against compromise. Nevertheless, our leaders are patiently trying to work things out.&quot; But he speaks mainly of divisions within Israeli society. In the past, he says, Israelis were too busy building and protecting their new state to focus on internal differences. In recent months the Israeli haredi community has come under particular scrutiny following calls by some of its more extreme sects for greater gender segregation and female modesty. The ultra-orthodox have also attracted criticism because many men choose religious study over paid work, relying on state benefits and evading compulsory military service. Weiss is scathing of the extremists within the community. &quot;The vast majority of haredi people are tolerant, respectful, and totally abhor the behaviour of \u2013 I wouldn&apos;t call them zealots or fanatics \u2013 they are criminals.&quot; But he says the attention given to the minority has been damaging to the community. &quot;It comes at a time when we see great effort by the new generation of ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel to integrate, to contribute, so that the secular part of society considers the haredi community as an equal partner.&quot; The current hostility to the ultra-orthodox was counter-productive to that effort, he says, encouraging the community to withdraw. Ultra-orthodox women are not second-class citizens, he insists. Religious women have a different lifestyle to secular women, but it is chosen by them, not forced on them. Israel is becoming a more religious society, he says, citing a survey showing 80% of respondents believe in God. But he hopes the country will find a &quot;common denominator&quot; both within its own society and with the Palestinians. &quot;But each part of this multi-dimensional nation and people needs to look inward to see how they relate to other parts of society with more appreciation and respect.&quot; THE UKRAINIAN NAME: Alex Yamnitzky AGE: 50 OCCUPATION: mechanical engineer LIVES: Sderot FAMILY: married, one child RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: secular Jewish Alex Yamnitzky came to Israel at the age of 28 from Ukraine. &quot;It wasn&apos;t anything ideological or religious. There was antisemitism, but it wasn&apos;t a major factor. Once the borders began to open, people around us started moving in search of a better life.&quot; The Jewish National Fund paid for tickets and helped support the new beginnings of Alex and a group of Jewish friends who made aliyah [immigrated to Israel] together. Alex worked in construction while learning Hebrew for a year, before finding a job as a mechanical engineer. He has lived in Sderot for more than 20 years, a town in southern Israel, close to the border with Gaza, which has a big community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. &quot;We tend to stick together,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I think of myself as Israeli, not Ukrainian. Being Israeli is not a religious identity for me but a national one \u2013 the fact that I&apos;m in my own country. Religion is not part of our daily lives.&quot; Alex says his economic hopes have been fulfilled, but that the cost of living in Israel is high. &quot;The economy worries me more than the political situation,&quot; he says, meaning the conflict with the Palestinians. &quot;The economy has to do with our everyday lives, whereas the political situation is much further away.&quot; This is despite living within the target range of rockets and missiles fired into Israel from Gaza. &quot;Of course the qassams [rockets] are part of our lives, but what can you do about it?&quot; He says things have eased in Sderot as the reach of the missiles has extended \u2013 &quot;the rockets fly further now&quot;. He dismisses the Palestinians&apos; claim to the land, saying &quot;they didn&apos;t really take care of it, and it only started to develop when the Jews came&quot;. His 18-year-old daughter, Vika, is about to start her two-year military service, which Alex feels is an important process in helping to cement national identity. &quot;The army is a page in every Israeli&apos;s life and it makes you stronger,&quot; he says. The family is disillusioned with elected politicians. Alex&apos;s wife, Inessa, says they expected more of Avigdor Lieberman, the hardline rightwing leader of Yisrael Beiteinu, a party which has a strong Russian base, &quot;but he does nothing now&quot;. &quot;The time when Russians would vote for someone because he is Russian is over,&quot; says Alex. &quot;We&apos;ve been here too long.&quot; THE SETTLER NAME: Natalie Hershkowitz AGE: 49 OCCUPATION: settlement secretary LIVES: Barkan FAMILY: married, six children RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: &apos;connected to God&apos; but not traditionally observant Natalie Hershkowitz moved from Tel Aviv to Barkan 15 years ago because she needed a big house to raise her family in and wanted to live in a &quot;good community&quot;. &quot;The fact that it was across the Green Line [in the West Bank] was a benefit. We come from the right side of the political map, so it was our duty to come here. It was the right thing to do according to our beliefs,&quot; she says. But the distance \u2013 25 minutes in the car \u2013 from Tel Aviv, and the &quot;quality of the air&quot;, helped the decision to move from the city in which she was born and raised. The price of land and property in West Bank settlements was cheap then, she says; now Barkan \u2013 which was founded in 1981 \u2013 &quot;is very exclusive&quot;. She describes it as a &quot;village&quot; not a settlement \u2013 &quot;although we are not ashamed of the word settlement. But the connotation today of &apos;settler&apos; is someone who came to conquer a foreign land. This is our land. We are not colonialists. God gave us this land.&quot; Natalie and her husband, Itzhak, say they have a strong connection to and belief in God, but are not conventionally observant Jews. &quot;We go to the synagogue regularly but not every week. We celebrate holy days. We don&apos;t keep a kosher kitchen, but we don&apos;t eat ham or oysters.&quot; Barkan is a mainly secular settlement. &quot;It&apos;s very important to say that,&quot; says Natalie, &quot;because people think once you cross the Green Line everyone is a religious fanatic. People don&apos;t know that a third of the [Jewish] population across the Green Line is secular.&quot; The essence of being Israeli, she says, is &quot;to be here on the biblical land of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]&quot;. The Palestinians who were born on the land should have the right to live there, &quot;but to live in peace with us. They can&apos;t make us disappear, we can&apos;t make them disappear.&quot; She points out that 3,000 Palestinians \u2013 or &quot;local Arabs&quot; \u2013 work in the settlement&apos;s industrial zone. &quot;We are working together, living together. It&apos;s impossible to divide us.&quot; She believes a separate Palestinian state is not possible &quot;even if the whole world recognises one. You can never draw a border because it&apos;s all too mixed up now. This land has to be one Israeli Jewish state, but with an Arab minority with human rights. This is meant to be ours, we were here before. I don&apos;t want to drive them away, but I want to live with them in peace.&quot; She includes Iran among the most important issues facing Israel, but says &quot;it&apos;s not only our problem, it&apos;s a problem of the whole western world&quot;. The settlement movement is getting stronger, she says. &quot;This situation will be for ever. No politician will ever be able to make a peace [with the Palestinians] without leaving us here.&quot; THE PALESTINIAN  NAME: Youssef Asfour AGE: 40 OCCUPATION: history teacher LIVES: Jaffa FAMILY: married, one child, triplets due in May RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: Muslim Youssef Asfour&apos;s relatives were displaced in the 1948 war, with some scattering to Lebanon and Gaza and his mother and father ending up in Ajami, an area of Jaffa he describes as a ghetto. &quot;On both sides, the families lost property and land,&quot; he says. &quot;My grandfather used to be a journalist. He finished his life cleaning at a butcher&apos;s shop in Carmel [the main Tel Aviv market].&quot; Despite his Israeli citizenship, Youssef does not consider himself as Israeli, but a Palestinian who lives in Israel. He shows his Israeli identity card. Until 2005, it used to categorise him as an &quot;Arab&quot;, but after many court battles ID cards now show a row of asterisks for all Israeli citizens. However, Jews are identified as such by their date of birth, shown according to the Hebrew as well as Gregorian calendar. &quot;I don&apos;t feel part of Israel,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m a native here. Why is it OK for someone who comes from America or Morocco or Russia to be here, but not me?&quot; He points to laws passed in the Israeli parliament, including one permitting communities to bar individuals who don&apos;t &quot;fit the social fabric&quot; from buying property and another outlawing the commemoration by public bodies of the Nakba, or catastrophe, suffered by the Palestinians in 1948. &quot;Look at these laws, and you will find the discrimination we suffer,&quot; says Youssef. As a history teacher, he says he is expected to teach a version of events which is disputed by Palestinians. &quot;I think it&apos;s a duty to teach both [Israeli and Palestinian] narratives. We need to teach that the Palestinians were here [before 1948], and that the Jews were victims of persecution in Europe. It is a mistake for both sides to ignore the other.&quot; Reaching a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most important issue, he says. &quot;Then all the money that now goes on weapons could be spent on education. If you want real democracy, start by building schools and teaching people how to read and write. This is the real revolution. Violence is never a solution; the solution is in education.&quot; THE HEDONIST NAME: Omer Gershon AGE: 37 OCCUPATION: marketing consultant and events producer LIVES: Tel Aviv FAMILY: single RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: none Omer Gershon is &quot;a true Tel Avivian&quot;, born and raised in the city, unlike many of its transient residents, and is a standard-bearer for its hedonistic, nihilistic, gay-friendly reputation. He is, he admits, &quot;the epitome of the bubble boy&quot;, referring to the city&apos;s insulation from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and dedication to partying. As a professional party-thrower, networker and partner in several clubs and bars, he says he is known as the king of nightlife. Tel Aviv, he says, is &quot;a country within a country \u2013 it&apos;s so separate from the rest of Israel. Everyone expects Israel to be a country in conflict, and then they come to Tel Aviv and everyone is partying or sitting in cafes and bars. We have a heightened sense of escapism because we&apos;re aware of life&apos;s fragility. The sense of carpe diem is very strong here.&quot; Gershon says his Jewishness is part of who he is and part of his family history, but not a big deal. He laughs when asked if he considers himself a Zionist. But he concedes he is a patriot, which he defines as loving his country while hating those who run it. &quot;I&apos;m proud of my heritage and proud to be Israeli, despite its infamous reputation. But I do realise every now and again that Israel is not so good if you&apos;re not Jewish \u2013 and if you&apos;re Arab, it&apos;s one of the worst places to be.&quot; Tel Aviv &quot;divides between activists who give a shit about everything and the rest of us who don&apos;t give a shit about anything&quot;. As a gay man, he says, Tel Aviv is a &quot;paradise&quot;. &quot;There is no feeling of ghettoisation. The gay scene is very integrated with the straight scene. There are very few gay bars because there are gay people in every bar.&quot; The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has little relevance to his life, but he insists &quot;the majority of people \u2013 both us and them \u2013 want peace. There&apos;s no reason for hate. But somehow the government fucks it up. That&apos;s how it feels.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-03-11T00:07:05Z", "title": "Israelis: Portrait of a people in tense times", "sentences": ["He points out that 90% of young people living on kibbutzim serve in the army, compared to only 50% living in Tel Aviv.", "&quot;We&apos;ve been here too long.&quot; THE SETTLER NAME: Natalie Hershkowitz AGE: 49 OCCUPATION: settlement secretary LIVES: Barkan FAMILY: married, six children RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: &apos;connected to God&apos; but not traditionally observant Natalie Hershkowitz moved from Tel Aviv to Barkan 15 years ago because she needed a big house to raise her family in and wanted to live in a &quot;good community&quot;.", "But the distance \u2013 25 minutes in the car \u2013 from Tel Aviv, and the &quot;quality of the air&quot;, helped the decision to move from the city in which she was born and raised.", "He finished his life cleaning at a butcher&apos;s shop in Carmel [the main Tel Aviv market].&quot; Despite his Israeli citizenship, Youssef does not consider himself as Israeli, but a Palestinian who lives in Israel.", "Violence is never a solution; the solution is in education.&quot; THE HEDONIST NAME: Omer Gershon AGE: 37 OCCUPATION: marketing consultant and events producer LIVES: Tel Aviv FAMILY: single RELIGIOUS IDENTITY: none Omer Gershon is &quot;a true Tel Avivian&quot;, born and raised in the city, unlike many of its transient residents, and is a standard-bearer for its hedonistic, nihilistic, gay-friendly reputation.", "Tel Aviv, he says, is &quot;a country within a country \u2013 it&apos;s so separate from the rest of Israel.", "Everyone expects Israel to be a country in conflict, and then they come to Tel Aviv and everyone is partying or sitting in cafes and bars.", "But I do realise every now and again that Israel is not so good if you&apos;re not Jewish \u2013 and if you&apos;re Arab, it&apos;s one of the worst places to be.&quot; Tel Aviv &quot;divides between activists who give a shit about everything and the rest of us who don&apos;t give a shit about anything&quot;.", "As a gay man, he says, Tel Aviv is a &quot;paradise&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/11/israel-living-in-worlds-spotlight"}, {"tags": [], "article": "I have just read your article about the killings of Americans who are supposedly training Afghan soldiers and advising in the various ministries in Kabul (Future of Afghan mission questioned, 2 March). I hope that these disasters will finally persuade the US government that the whole Afghanistan adventure was misconceived. Every day we read comments from the US government talking about bringing &quot;freedom and democracy&quot; to Afghanistan. Supposedly this is the reason why we have remained there after defeating al-Qaida. This is a delusion. It is amazing that the US has not learned anything from the history of Afghanistan. The British fought three disastrous wars there, and in one of them, lost a whole army trying to leave the country. Later the Russians were also humiliated. Notwithstanding this history, the US government still has fantasies about leaving a &quot;free&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; state in Afghanistan while training the Afghan army to resist the Taliban. The Afghans have never been united under one central government; their allegiance is to multiple tribes, and for centuries they have shared one common purpose: keeping foreigners out. How long can this fantasy continue? How long can the misery of the Afghan people be prolonged by our illusions about American power and purposes? Rodney Barker Newton, Massachusetts, US An act of stupidity Seumas Milne says that Attacking Iran would be an act of stupidity (2\u00a0March). Probably. Unfortunately, it may also be an act of political expedience. Obama does indeed have every interest in heading off an Israeli attack, at least until after the elections. Binyamin Netanyahu, however, has every interest in setting off such an attack, preferably just before Israeli elections. He would much rather any of the Republicans were in the White House, no matter how toothless the Obama administration has been towards the Israeli government. In the event of an Israeli attack, the US will either not join in and Obama will be portrayed as spineless, therefore losing the elections; or the US will join in and be locked into another endless war, having to protect Israel for years. And Obama will still risk losing the election. Win-win for the leadership in Tel Aviv. Then, more likely than not, Israel&apos;s Arab neighbourhood will go up in flames as Iran retaliates and the whole region gets dragged into war, which will quickly be followed by sectarian strife in several if not all countries, and if things get really bad tensions might escalate between Arab states themselves. Which is fine by Israel as it does not trust them one iota, no matter how American their growing weapons stockpile might be. It would be a dangerous gambit on the part of Netanyahu, but Israel is a survivor and it has less to lose than Washington and Europe. Adding to this, a turbulent Middle East might keep Israel free from neighbours becoming powerful enough to be threatening for years to come and guarantee another win when it is Netanyahu&apos;s turn at the ballots. One man&apos;s act of stupidity might be another one&apos;s coup. S Nogueira Brussels, Belgium \u2022 Matthew Kroenig is quoted as saying that a nuclear Iran &quot;would immediately limit US freedom of action in the Middle East&quot;, that is, create a counterforce against US and Israeli domination. That seems right, just as a nuclear Israel has provided freedom to pursue aggressive actions with impunity since the 1960s against its Arab neighbours. A nuclear Iran could inspire Israel to get serious about negotiations with the Palestinians and Arab states. Israel would then have reason to accept past Arab League offers of peace were it to accept a Palestinian state and return of Syrian lands. Baylis Thomas New York City, US Empowering the poor I was saddened to see Bill Gates spending $200m on technical fixes for small farmers (Gates pledges $200m for small farmers, 2 March), instead of using his money to support Vandana Shiva and people like her working with poor communities around the world. I suppose it might have been worse: Gates could have given even more money towards a mindset that ignores the warnings of Olivier De Schutters, the UN special rapporteur, that empowerment of the poor is needed rather than imposition of the Monsanto corporate model for controlling seed. There is more than just hope that sustainable ways to feed the world can be found. The UN report on the right to food shows food production in the developing world can double in 10 years using climate-smart agro-ecological systems that are ready to go. These techniques are light years away from where Gates&apos;s philanthropy or global agribusiness would take the world. Perhaps India&apos;s Manmohan Singh (Indian PM blames NGOs for nuclear power delays, 2 March) will also be reassured that it is his own farmers that are opposing contamination of their system, rather than US NGOs, as he seems to believe. Jon Carapiet Auckland, New Zealand Enthusiastic waiters It was a really interesting metaphor that the bankers chose to use in Joris Luyendijk&apos;s Just doing their jobs (24 February): they chose to see themselves as &quot;overenthusiastic waiters&quot; in an effort to lay culpability for the global financial crisis with customers asking for a loan. To take this metaphor further I can imagine waiters of such calibre when approached by an alcoholic, offering a bottle of whisky saying, &quot;Go on sir, you know you want to; don&apos;t worry about the cash, I&apos;ll put it on your slate.&quot; The waiter&apos;s boss would then take him aside with regard to such gross irresponsibility and reassure him that his share of the tips jar would be distributed as normal, and to try not to worry. Should the licensing authorities have the temerity to ask any awkward questions as to their conduct once word got out, they would whine about how unfair it all was and threaten to shut the bar and reopen in an offshore tax haven somewhere, where people wouldn&apos;t be so horribly mean. If that&apos;s the way that the metaphor extends itself, then perhaps I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with bankers in thinking that it&apos;s an accurate and entirely appropriate one. Gary Laidlaw Norwich, UK The death of the letter I grow weary of hearing the death of letter-writing foretold as the inevitable result of email (The stamp of history, 2 March). I find email invaluable as a means of delivering my letters to friends \u2013 letters that are written in the traditional form, starting with &quot;Dear (whoever)&quot;, and ending with &quot;Love, Kate&quot;. In between, I talk about what&apos;s happening in my life, maybe attach a photo or two, enquire after my friends&apos; health and wellbeing, and sometimes make arrangements \u2013 all the things I used to do in handwritten letters. The difference is that I no longer have the expense and inconvenience of buying a stamp and going out to a postbox. And, even more important, I can confidently expect it to arrive, and in a very short time. For many years I have had friends in out-of-the-way places, and I can assure Kathryn Hughes that posting a letter to Mozambique, Ethiopia or Sudan always felt like the ultimate act of faith. Even if it managed to get to its destination, it could take several weeks. Then, of course, when you replied to the news in their reply, it could well be already out of date. For communicating short messages, most of us used postcards \u2013 in\u00a0those days they usually arrived. Nowadays I use emails for this as well, but for a proper chat \u2013 the phone. As a historian, Hughes must be aware that in 1840 many people in this country were illiterate, thus letters could not provide an insight into their lives, for later generations. And, of course, the vast majority of letters did not survive. Most letters are not written for the benefit of historians.

Haaretz noted that the PRC was &quot;the organisation that captured Gilad Shalit&quot;, the Israeli soldier who was freed in October 2011. The army says that al-Qaissi was behind the August 2011 attack that took place on the Israeli-Egyptian border \u2013 even though the PRC denied involvement and it was later revealed that the militants came from Sinai, not Gaza. While army sources took care to point out al-Qaissi&apos;s alleged involvement in the August 2011 incident, his assassination wasn&apos;t just an act of punishment. No, Israel killed him on the basis of secret evidence \u2013 evidence that is not subject to legal or judicial review \u2013 that supposedly proves that al-Qaissi was planning a terror attack. Never mind that the Israeli supreme court&apos;s December 2006 ruling placed numerous restrictions on such assassinations. Fatmeh el-Ajou, an attorney with Adalah, the legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel, explains that while the judgment did not place a blanket prohibition on targeted killings, it stated that the decision to carry out an assassination must be made on a case-by-case basis, &quot;depending on the evidence that [security forces] have&quot;. But, without seeing the security forces&apos; secret evidence, it&apos;s impossible to know if al-Qaissi was indeed planning an attack, and if the army was in line with the 2006 ruling. There&apos;s no transparency in this so-called democracy and, without transparency, there is no accountability to the state&apos;s highest court. &quot;From the perspective of human rights law,&quot; el-Ajou adds, &quot;assassinations are not legitimate \u2026 They should only be carried out if there is a &apos;ticking bomb.&apos; [Suspects] should be brought to trial.&quot; To some extent, the 2006 ruling dovetails with this, stating that, whenever possible, the person in question must be arrested and tried \u2013 which is exactly what didn&apos;t happen in 2007, when the army violated the supreme court&apos;s restrictions on targeted killings and assassinated two men they had the power to detain instead. And then there&apos;s the laundry list of less dramatic examples, instances when state bodies quietly ignore the court, revealing Israel to be the weak democracy it is. Such cases have spurred former deputy attorney general Yehudit Karp to send not one but two letters of complaint to the current attorney General Yehuda Weinstein. Here&apos;s a partial sampling of rulings that Israel can&apos;t be bothered to fully implement: \u2022 In 2002, the supreme court ordered the municipalities of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Lod, Ramle and Nazareth Illit to &quot;add Arabic to all municipal signs&quot;, Adalah writes. Last April, the supreme court chastised the municipality of Nazareth Illit (upper Nazareth, a predominately Jewish area) for its lack of compliance with the nine-year-old ruling. \u2022 In 2006, the supreme court struck down the binding arrangement, a policy that binds migrant workers to one employer, essentially making his or her visa contingent on his employer&apos;s whim. Last year, the Knesset circumvented this ruling, passing legislation so severe that human rights groups referred to it as the &quot;slavery law&quot;. \u2022 In 2007, the Israeli supreme court ruled that the separation barrier in the West Bank Palestinian village of Bilin served no security purpose in its location and ordered the state to move the fence. While Israel did move it in 2011, more than four years after the court&apos;s decision, villagers are still separated from some of their land. \u2022 During the December 2008 to January 2009 Israeli military operation known as Cast Lead, Israel barred media from the Gaza Strip. Even though the supreme court ruled against the ban, the press was not admitted to Gaza. \u2022 In April 2011, the supreme court overturned the policy that stripped migrant workers who had children in Israel of their legal status, calling it a violation of the state&apos;s own labour laws. Almost a year later, Israel is still deporting some of these women and their children, despite the fact that the very mechanism that made them &quot;illegal&quot; has been nullified. In his 2006 ruling on targeted killings, former supreme court president Aharon Barak quoted an earlier judgment in which he&apos;d stated: &quot;At times democracy fights with one hand behind her back.&quot; But in its war on Palestinians \u2013 and anyone that Israel deems an &quot;other&quot; \u2013 not only does the state use both hands, it fights with the proverbial gloves off. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-03-14T11:58:41Z", "title": "The killing of Zuhair al-Qaissi exposes Israel's attitude to its supreme court | Mya Guarnieri", "sentences": ["Here&apos;s a partial sampling of rulings that Israel can&apos;t be bothered to fully implement: \u2022 In 2002, the supreme court ordered the municipalities of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Lod, Ramle and Nazareth Illit to &quot;add Arabic to all municipal signs&quot;, Adalah writes."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/israel-killing-zuhair-al-qaissi"}, {"tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "At only 21, the Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov is already heavy with honours. Last autumn he came to London as the recent winner of the repackaged Moscow Tchaikovsky competition, delivering an often exhilarating rendering of the Tchaikovsky B-flat minor concerto under Valery Gergiev. Now he returned as a winner once again, this time of last year&apos;s Arthur Rubinstein competition in Tel Aviv for this London recital debut at the Wigmore Hall. Inevitably, only time will tell if Trifonov can cope with all this and become a truly mature artist. On the basis of this recital, the signs point in both directions. The technique is prodigious though not unlimited; the musicianly qualities are unmissable but come in flashes, not always sustained over long arcs of writing. There is a rawness in the playing that is by turns intoxicating and frustrating. The principal work of the evening was Schubert&apos;s B flat sonata D960, a grownup&apos;s work if ever there were one, and a bold choice. There was much to persuade here. The shadowed tone and delicate touch of the opening were impressively controlled, and the third movement scherzo was full of dancing clarity, beautifully articulated. But for too much of the sonata, Trifonov played either softly or very loudly, with not much of the subtle middle registers in which the long lines of this masterpiece are so compellingly developed. He began the second half with four Tchaikovsky minatures, played with great character but sometimes over-pedalled. Chopin&apos;s Op 10 \u00c9tudes, which followed, were generally a bit too hard-driven, but occasionally the storm clouds parted to reveal some ravishingly lovely and thoughtful playing, notably in the sixth study in E flat minor. Let&apos;s hope it is this aspect of Trifonov&apos;s pianism that prevails over the flashier side. Is Trifonov the great new Russian master? One day, he might be. It&apos;s all in there.

Mulling over the five owners in three years and the parade of players and agents who earned prodigiously and moved on, some at battered Fratton Park see the fabled agent Pini Zahavi as emblematic. He was involved in the buying and selling of Portsmouth, earned money in deals to sign and sell several players, acted on the recruitment of Avram Grant as the manager and had a scouting agreement with the club worth \u00a3800,000. &quot;Pini Zahavi is described as a super agent,&quot; says Ashley Brown, chairman of the Pompey Supporters Trust, &quot;but like many others, he made his money and is gone. We&apos;re left with a club in the Championship and very little infrastructure, struggling to survive. Zahavi&apos;s lasting legacy is Tal Ben Haim.&quot; The Israeli defender, signed by an already financially imploding Portsmouth in August 2009, is still on that same four-year contract, paid \u00a336,000 a week, highlighted by the administrator, Trevor Birch of PKF, as grimly excessive. Zahavi, speaking from his Tel Aviv office where, he said, he is very busy doing football deals around the world, clarified his involvement at Portsmouth. He pointed out that like all creditors besides players and other clubs, he has not been paid &quot;one penny&quot; of the \u00a32.074m he was owed when the club collapsed into administration for the first time, in February 2010. &quot;I was a victim at Portsmouth,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, I worked to bring Avram Grant and Tal Ben Haim, I had the scouting agreement and agents fees, but I was kept waiting for money because of my friendship with the club. I never thought they would go into bankruptcy.&quot; Zahavi confirmed he introduced the young French-Israeli Sacha Gaydamak to buy Portsmouth from the previous owner, Milan Mandaric, in 2006. The former chief executive Peter Storrie recalled the first meeting, attended by him, Gaydamak and Zahavi, because Mandaric had not wanted to waste his time if the deal was not real. &quot;Of course I got a commission for bringing in Sacha Gaydamak,&quot; Zahavi said. However, he said he was not involved or paid on the subsequent takeovers, after Gaydamak withdrew his funding in 2008 with Portsmouth haemorrhaging losses. Zahavi said he did not work on the takeovers by Sulaiman al-Fahim, from Dubai, in August 2009, and denied a previous report that he then brokered the takeover by the Saudi Arabian Ali al-Faraj, five weeks later, saying only that he is friendly with a lawyer who worked on that deal, Yoram Yusepov. Neither, he said, did he know Balram Chainrai, the Hong Kong-based lender who ended up owning Portsmouth and putting it into administration and still has a \u00a317m secured loan over the club. &quot;I know him now, since he took over,&quot; Zahavi said, &quot;and he is a top man. But I did not know him before.&quot; When Gaydamak was lending millions and guaranteeing bank borrowings to sanction expensive signings of top players under managers including Harry Redknapp, Zahavi did work on some of the deals. He had already been involved during Mandaric&apos;s time, in the signing of the Zambian striker Collins Mbesuma in August 2005, and Storrie recalled Zahavi working on the signings of the Israeli midfielder Eyal Berkovic and Yakubu Ayegbeni, from Maccabi Haifa, in April\u00a02003. Famously Zahavi had a \u00a33m agent&apos;s fee agreed with Middlesbrough when Yakubu moved from Portsmouth in July 2005, payable if the striker stayed at Middlesbrough for five years \u2013 he moved to Everton after two. Portsmouth sources recall Zahavi worked on the signing of Glen Johnson from Chelsea in August 2007, although Zahavi said he did not, and to sign Youn\u00e8s Kaboul from Tottenham Hotspur the following summer. Zahavi did not say if he worked on that deal. &quot;I mostly sold the players,&quot; Zahavi said. &quot;I saved the club from bankruptcy because I managed to sell the best players.&quot; Sulley Muntari&apos;s departure to Internazionale, for \u00a312.7m in July 2008, was one of those sales, he said. Storrie explained why Portsmouth agreed for Zahavi to work as a scouting consultant, a two-year contract worth \u00a3400,000 a year. &quot;He has a lot of contacts in Argentina, Brazil and Chile and we thought we could tap into that knowledge,&quot; Storrie said. &quot;It could have been a hell of a good deal for the club but it wasn&apos;t long before administration happened.&quot; Zahavi said he presented Portsmouth with possible players to buy from all over the world but the club did not conclude any deals. &quot;I got them amazing opportunities for players but they never bought them because they did not have any money,&quot; he said. He was paid the commission from Gaydamak and fees for the deals in the times of plenty but, when Portsmouth fell into administration, his \u00a32.074m outstanding was included on a list of 24 agents to whom Portsmouth owed almost \u00a39m in total. The debt to Zahavi included his scouting agreement and the fees from several player transfers. &quot;Because of my friendship with them, I agreed to wait,&quot; he said. &quot;Most agents got more than me. This money was the scouting and agents&apos; fees from four to five years of hard work and I didn&apos;t get a penny.&quot; Ben Haim was signed in a deal brokered by Zahavi on the final day of the 2009 summer transfer window, days after Fahim&apos;s ill-fated takeover. Storrie defends it, saying they had to sign players quickly. &quot;He was a Premier League player and \u00a335,000 a week wasn&apos;t an outrageous sum of money. There was nothing untoward about it.&quot; With a contract for image rights, payable to a company registered in the tax haven of Guernsey, Ben Haim&apos;s pay totalled around \u00a350,000 a week, \u00a32.5m a year, for four years, a \u00a310m commitment. Two administrations on, bottom of the Championship after a 10-point deduction, Portsmouth must still pay Ben Haim&apos;s wages. In England, unlike Scotland where Rangers players agreed a significant pay cut, footballers&apos; wages are protected in administration by agreement with the Professional Footballers&apos; Association and by the &quot;football creditors rule&quot; that requires players and clubs to be paid in full, while other creditors must accept a fraction of what they are owed. At Portsmouth Birch laid off 33 staff while Ben Haim&apos;s and the other players&apos; wages cannot be cut at all. Pompey&apos;s second administration, after the most recent owner, Vladimir Antonov, was arrested for alleged bank fraud in Lithuania, which he denies, means those owed money from the first, who were due 20p in the pound, including Zahavi, will not see that. Birch is talking up the club&apos;s &quot;special&quot; qualities, its loyal support, hoping to attract a buyer with the promise of selling some high-earning players in the summer, reducing the ongoing commitments. Zahavi said that he thinks in the summer Ben Haim will move on. As for him, the &quot;super agent&quot;, he said: &quot;I am doing a lot of business.

We&apos;re even fed with flashy graphics of likely routes for a theoretical Israeli attack on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities; turning the possible destruction of one of the world&apos;s most explosive regions into a video game. Meanwhile, the most crucial component of this debate \u2013 the 78 million people living in Iran \u2013 have so far been left out of the equation. Yet, the perspectives of ordinary Iranians could make or break western hopes for Iran \u2013 whether they involve regime change or domestic reforms. Iranians tend to see current events through the lens of their long history and ancient culture. With the celebrations of Persian new year, Nowruz, this week, the myth of the holiday&apos;s founder, as told in our national epic, the Shahnameh, is a valuable window into Iranian attitudes. The poem tells the story of Jamshid, a king and high priest. A wise ruler, he becomes arrogant and is eventually overthrown by a foreign conqueror \u2013 an Arab named Zahak, who gathers an army and ultimately saws Jamshid in half to the pleasure of his dissatisfied subjects. Reading this far, one could be excused for thinking that Iranians welcome outside intervention to rid them of domestic tyranny. But not so fast. Things get more complicated. After centuries of rule marked by terror, Iranians have had enough and rise up against Zahak. With a blacksmith&apos;s apron as their banner, their leader Fereydoun ousts the Arab despot and imprisons him. For a millennium, the Shahnameh has taught Iranians to be deeply suspicious of foreign interference; six decades ago, Prime Minister Mossadeq portrayed himself as unshackling Iran from the chains of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and suceeded in rallying the nation; less than three decades later, the shah was overthrown following a revolution that painted his rule as unjust on the basis of the western backing he enjoyed. The current rhetoric from western capitals and Israel is feeding into this age-old narrative. A new Gallup survey shows that almost half of Iranians say there were times in the past year when they did not have enough money to buy food their families needed; three times as many as when the first UN security council sanctions were passed against Iran over its nuclear programme in 2006. And these punitive measures are already causing blowback; instead of rising up against their government \u2013 the &quot;true&quot; objective of the sanctions in the eyes of many officials in Tehran \u2013 few Iranians favour western leaders. Squeezed between ongoing pressure from their government and unprecedented US-led sanctions, less than one in 10 Iranians now approves of US leadership. And a continued failure to understand Iran&apos;s founding myths will continue to cost the United States an increasing number of hearts and minds in the Islamic republic. Weakening Jamshid&apos;s subjects, while portraying yourself as Zahak, won&apos;t change anything. Washington, London and Tel Aviv must not assume Iranian protests against injustice at home is the same as support for the west. Many Iranians are unhappy with their government, but also angry at the west. So, what can then be done to reverse the deterioration of the west&apos;s position in the eyes of most Iranians? Firstly, support for groups such as the terror-listed Mujahideen-e-Khalq organisation (MEK) will only further push Iranians towards closing ranks rather than looking for a foreign saviour. Secondly, more attention needs to be paid to the effects of the sanctions on Iranians&apos; lives. As a former senior diplomat said to me the other day, with not a trace of anxiety in his voice, &quot;They have nothing left to sanction. The only bullet left in their gun is an actual physical attack.&quot; He went on: &quot;We have lived under sanctions for over 30 years, and fought against Saddam for almost a decade. We will get through this.&quot; The day afterwards, I was shocked to overhear a slick, young man in an trendy north Tehran cafe echo an old revolutionary slogan to his lightly veiled female friends: &quot;America can&apos;t do a damn thing.&quot; Whether the west&apos;s objective is to strike a deal with the Islamic republic or to get rid of it, the way to regain soft power in Iran is dialogue and to put an end to punitive measures affecting ordinary people. This will make citizens&apos; voices stronger and force the leadership to listen. But it needs to be done while there are still some Iranians who are not convinced that the US is a modern-day Zahak. And judging by the way things are progressing, time is not on the west&apos;s side. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T10:06:12Z", "title": "What can the US learn from the Persian new year? | Mohammad Ali Shabani", "sentences": ["Washington, London and Tel Aviv must not assume Iranian protests against injustice at home is the same as support for the west."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/22/us-persian-new-year-foreign-intervention"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "This is a feature-length piece, so you may wish to print off for the journey home or some such Abraham Klein had his hands in his pockets. He was 36 years old and about to referee his first World Cup game. To one side stood Pele, Carlos Alberto, Rivelino and Jairzinho; to the other Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst and Gordon Banks. This was the grandest game, between the favourites Brazil and the holders England; the final before the final. The referee was an unknown Israeli. One report said that appointing him was \u201clike sending a boy scout to Vietnam\u201d. Klein trusted his ability; so did Fifa. But anybody with an anima would have been nervous. He had refereed international games before. Only five of them, though, none anywhere near this stratosphere. This was a football opera, and his hands were trembling like a violin string. It gave a whole new meaning to the pre-match handshake. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cMy hands were shaking, so I put them in my pockets. I did not want the players to see how my hands were moving. Then I took them out and I decided to be strong in my body and in my hand.\u201d He met both captains with an unyielding handshake, looked left and right and blew the whistle for the start of the match. His life had just taken an almighty fork in the road. Cinderella as done by HBO The past may be a foreign country, but that\u2019s no excuse for xenophobia. The arrogance of modernity dictates that the best we have ever seen becomes the best that ever there was. How would we know? It\u2019s certainly true of referees. At the end of the 20th century, Pierluigi Collina was widely perceived to be the best referee in the history of football. Collina was a wonderful referee, surely the best of his generation; beyond that, we don\u2019t really know. Suggestions that he was bald head and shoulders above all other referees is an insult to those who excelled before him \u2013 not least Abraham Klein, the marvellous Israeli referee who was generally accepted as the world\u2019s best in the 1970s and early 1980s. In a piece in the Times during Italia 90, the veteran football writer David Miller said Klein was \u201cprobably the best referee for the past 20 years\u201d. Alan Robinson, the overseas and services secretary of the English Referees\u2019 Association from 1968 to 2004, described him as \u201cthe master of the whistle\u201d. In the interests of balance, we must point out that not everybody concurred. Klein did not appear in Graham Poll\u2019s list of the 50 greatest referees of all time, a list that includes \u2013 and you\u2019ll like this \u2013 Graham Poll. Klein\u2019s is an astonishing story, pitched somewhere between feelgood fairytale and life-affirming quality drama; Cinderella as done by HBO. To say his is a life less ordinary doesn\u2019t begin to do it justice. He survived prejudice, politics and even the Holocaust to reach the top of his trade. He made his World Cup debut in one of the tournament\u2019s most famous matches - when, in referee years, he was barely out of short pants. He missed the 1974 World Cup because of the Munich massacre of his fellow Israelis two years earlier. He was scandalously deprived of the World Cup final of 1978, punished for his own scrupulous excellence. He ran the line in the 1982 World Cup while not knowing whether his son was alive or dead. He overcame all that to be regarded as peerless. No wonder he says determination is his strongest characteristic. It would be enough to take decades off most men, yet Klein is a miracle of fitness and optimism. He turns 78 on 29 March, but his physical and mental sharpness defy his age. He is still the same weight as he was when he refereed Brazil and England in 1970. Look down at your stomach now and imagine that it will be the same in 42 years\u2019 time. Exactly. Klein is the type of person who sees the good in everything and everyone (except baseball, a rare hate). When we talk, back in January, he is full of the joys of Novak Djokovic versus Lleyton Hewitt in the Australian Open. \u201cWonderful tennis. What can I tell you?\u201d Even on the phone from the other side of the world, he radiates an avuncular wisdom. He has a habit of saying, \u201cI must tell you \u2026\u201d, and when he does you feel like you are settling down for an audience with Mr Miyagi. Klein is also unfailingly polite; when you say matter-of-factly that he was the world\u2019s best referee, he says simply, \u201cThank you, thank you\u201d. If this paints a picture of Klein as a soft man, don\u2019t believe it. He has an innate toughness that allowed him to control matches with natural authority in an age when hard man roamed the green with malevolent intent. That, and a level of preparation that would put most modern referees to shame, never mind those 30 years ago, were two of the keys to his success. Klein has the lovely habit of talking in the present tense, with a voice that \u2013 although his generally excellent English is occasionally broken \u2013 you want to present verbatim. He regularly uses the phrase \u201cI feel it\u201d, testament to the sixth sense that served him so well on the field. Another of his favourite words is \u201cunbelievable\u201d. This is no Chris Kamara-like tic. Klein\u2019s story is one you wouldn\u2019t dream of scripting. \u2018Don\u2019t eat all the bread!\u2019 Timisoara is often described as the most beautiful city in Romania. A piece in this paper spoke of its \u201cbold, age-worn architecture\u201d, \u201chandsome, cracked grandeur\u201d and \u201cwealth of genuinely grand Habsburg buildings\u201d. This gallery shows that your retinas could do a lot worse. Yet sometimes beauty is in the mind\u2019s eye of the beholder. There is no beauty for Abraham Klein. Timisoara is where he was born and spent his first 13 years, six of them during the second world war. \u201cMy memories from that city are so bad that when I was in Romania as a Uefa observer two or three times they ask me if I want to go to Timosara to see my city,\u201d he says. \u201cI told them, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go\u2019. What I remember, I don\u2019t want to remember again.\u201d Klein eventually escaped Timisoara, one of 500 children who were put on a train to Holland. \u201cMy mother was still alive,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of my family were killed in Auschwitz, in the concentration camps. My father was lucky that he left Romania in 1937 before the war starts. When the war starts it was impossible to leave the country with my mother. For five years it was very difficult for us. My mother had six sisters; we lived with them and the parents in two rooms. The situation was not the best.\u201d It\u2019s so far beyond our comprehension that there\u2019s no point even trying to empathise. The train journey took three weeks, with very little food and no parents; those who were still alive had to stay in Romania. The children were taken to a school in Apeldoorn \u2013 \u201ca very small place in Holland, a beautiful place\u201d \u2013 where they would stay for a year. \u201cI remember the first meal we had. It was lunchtime after three weeks on the train. When we arrived at the restaurant there was plenty of bread on the table. We run inside, all the children, we start eating the bread. Then they come to tell us, \u2018Wait, wait, we have plenty of food \u2013 we have soup, milk, potatoes. Don\u2019t eat all the bread!\u2019\u201d The memories are some of the happiest of Klein\u2019s life. \u201cI must tell you that whenever I come back to Holland, I go to see Apeldoorn.\u201d After a year, he went to a kibbutz in Israel, then back to live with his parents in Haifa. \u201cI come to the conclusion that the life in a kibbutz is not for me.\u201d The kindness that he found in Apeldoorn tattooed itself on his soul. \u201cThere are things in life that you cannot forget. When, after the second world war, a country like Holland gives you the feeling that you are at home; when they give you everything: food, education, sport, etcetera, etcetera \u2026 these are things that you cannot forget. It was something unbelievable.\u201d Preparing to succeed Abraham Klein was not supposed to be a referee. He loved football and wanted to be a footballer. His father had played for MTK Budapest in Hungary; Klein was good, but not up to that standard. Serendipity did what needed to be done. In the mid-50s, on a break from army duty, his parents sent him to buy some trousers from a tailor called Jonas. Jonas was about to leave to referee an amateur game. He told Klein to come with him, and that he would make his trousers after the game. Jonas turned an ankle during the match. He asked Klein to step in.  \u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t know the laws of the game\u2019. \u2018But you\u2019ve played the game?\u2019 I told him, \u2018Yes I was a player, not the best but I know what is a foul.\u2019 So he said, \u2018The laws of the game are very simple, it\u2019s not university. Somebody make a foul, you whistle.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s all?\u2019 That\u2019s all the laws?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s enough for this game.\u2019  Klein showed such natural aptitude for refereeing, and such enjoyment of it, that he soon took the formal refereeing examinations. He would catch up with Jonas more than two decades later. Jonas later moved to New York, and found Klein among 60,000 people at a New York Cosmos game. \u201cBut,\u201d said Klein in this interview, \u201che didn\u2019t have my trousers \u2026\u201d By then, Klein was wearing the trousers on the field of play. He rose through the ranks, refereeing army games, youth games, Israeli league games \u2013 and even the first meeting between teams from West Germany and Israel. In 1969, Hapoel Nahariya played against an amateur German team named Bayern Hof. Klein had no idea of its significance until he was interviewed by a German TV company 40 years later for a documentary. He had refereed his first Israeli league game in 1958, at the age of 24; six years later he graduated to international football, when Israel played a friendly against the Netherlands. In 1965, at the age of 31, he was given his first major game: Italy v Poland in Rome. It was on a scale previously unimaginable. The biggest grounds in Israel held 20,000; now he would be officiating a World Cup qualifier in front of 80,000. Klein decided to take matters into his own hands \u2013 a week before the match, on his own initiative and out of his own pocket, he went to watch Roma play Napoli at the Stadio Olimpico. \u201cI decided, alone, to take a plane in the morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI come back late with Alitalia, 10 o\u2019clock at night I remember. I went to the game, I bought a ticket; nobody knew that I was there. I was in the stadium with the people, in the crowd, and I feel the weather, you know; I feel how they behave. I was shocked, because 80,000 people were shouting and crying.\u201d He was not shocked a week later when he returned for the Poland game. Klein\u2019s preparation could not have been more thorough. He learned as much as possible about the players \u2013 this in an age before computers, never mind the internet, and when phone calls overseas were extremely expensive. Klein wrote to a friend in Poland, asking for information on their team, and persuaded Gazzetta dello Sport to send him a series of cuttings. \u201cThey wrote everything every day about everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know more than the family about the player.\u201d He learned that Gigi Rivera was a star player \u201cand that the defenders try all the time to kick him\u201d. Klein, always a keen exponent of the advantage rule - \u201cone of the most beautiful things in the game\u201d - vowed to play it wherever possible. Three of Italy\u2019s goals in a 6-1 win came from advantages. The Fifa observers at the ground took notice. Throughout his career, Klein was not prepared to fail. The level of his preparation, both physical and mental, was extraordinary. He was not years ahead of his time; he was a generation ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a good advantage \u2013 not just in refereeing but in everything in life \u2013 if you know the person who is standing before you,\u201d he says. He would study hours of videos to see what tactics the teams used, which players dived, which tried to bully opponents or referees. In 1970 he arrived early and spent a fortnight in the Camino Royale in Guadalajara, acclimatising and studying teams. \u201cI know the tactics of the Brazilian players,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw that inside the area \u2013 or just outside, because of Rivelino\u2019s free kicks \u2013 that if it was shoulder to shoulder they would be very close to the grass. If you remember the [England] game, [Alan] Mullery with Pele inside the area, shoulder to shoulder and Pele was down. So I tried to learn everything, and also the behaviour when you make your decisions. \u201cBefore every tournament I try to learn the language. Of course I know Hungarian, my mother language (Timisoara was originally part of Hungary), and Romanian. I speak some German, not the best. I learn Spanish, French, Italian because at school I learn Latin so it\u2019s very simple. I understand not 100%, but if I understand more than 50% when I read sport magazines, that is enough.\u201d He understood 100% about diet and exercise. In his 1995 guidebook for officials, The Referee\u2019s Referee, Klein goes into rare detail about his preparation. Everything is explained down to the last carbohydrate portion, the last check of your pulse rate, the last 2,000-metre jog and the last 50-metre sprint (backwards, this time, to simulate match conditions). In the mid-1970s, when Prozone was but a glint in Sam Allardyce\u2019s eye, Klein measured that he ran seven and a half miles in a match. Before that Mexico World Cup he climbed mountains in Israel to help cope with the altitude; before the Argentina World Cup eight years he trained in a similar climate in Cape Town. In 1982, concerned that, at the age of 48, his fitness was not what it should be - \u201cthe passing of time started to put marks on my body\u201d - he commissioned a physical trainer called Jacob Almor, who prepared a bespoke program. \u201cIt was based on gradually increasing my stamina and my physical conditioning,\u201d wrote Klein in his 2010 autobiography, The Master of the Whistle. \u201cIt included long-distance running on sandy beaches and on hard surface streets of my town, Haifa. Long-distance endurance cycling and short speed sprints on an athletic field as well as utilising a gym, where weight lifting and rubber-bands equipment helped my load endurance and flexibility. We started slowly but then picked up the tempo. The training was intense twice each day, mornings and evenings. It was murder; very hard; plenty of suffering for a 48-year-old chap. I shed nine pounds in four weeks and prepared my body for 120 minutes of a physical stress load so as to allow me proper refereeing stamina for extra time, just in case.\u201d Almor wanted no money, and said it would be an honour to help Klein. But always the preparation was done off Klein\u2019s own bat and, when necessary, out of his own pocket. In his day referees had to pass the Cooper Test \u2013 running 2,600m in 12 minutes \u2013 as part of their preparation. When he later became chairman of the referees\u2019 committee he immediately upped it to 3,000 metres. \u201cI told the referees: you must be fitter than the players, because there are 11 players on the field. You have to be in the right position. A striker can miss a goal, but if a referee misses an incident it can be catastrophic. Some very, very famous referees \u2013 I don\u2019t want to tell you their names \u2013 made some bad decisions in World Cup games. It was their last World Cup. I made mistakes in my country in some games, I know, but I couldn\u2019t afford for 1970 to be my last World Cup.\u201d Learning from those mistakes was a key part of his development. \u201cThe first analysis is the most important thing after the game \u2013 to learn, and not to think you are the best in the world. When I met my wife she told me: every time you can do better. And she is right. You can do better in everything. When I made a mistake, then I try to avoid these mistakes again. I had a semi-final in Tel Aviv when the ball was not over the line but I was in a poor position and awarded a goal. Everybody wanted to kill me. \u201cIn Italy v Brazil in 1982 \u2013 the last moment of the game - you can see Dino Zoff on the line with the ball [after saving Oscar\u2019s header]. I had an excellent view. You can see the Brazilian players wave their hands that the ball is in, but you can see me wave that the ball is on the line.\u201d In the last minute of his last World Cup game as referee, Klein\u2019s immaculate preparation had paid off one last time. Emotional intelligence Abraham Klein arrived in Guadalajara in late May 1970. For the next two weeks, he ignored the not inconsiderable temptations of a fascinating city, and concentrated on his usual preparation. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave my hotel for two weeks, even for one day, to see the city,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the city at all, only the hotel and the stadium. I want to concentrate only on the game. I know that I cannot have a bad game. It was very important for me because I know that, coming from a small country, I have a big responsibility to the Fifa members who appointed me to the game. Later I ask Sir Stanley Rous or Ken Aston (the Fifa president and chairman of the referees\u2019 committee, respectively) why they chose me. I was a very young referee with no experience, only five international games. Aston always told me: we trust you, you are honest, you make good impression and you are in good physical condition.\u201d Klein wasn\u2019t plucked out of thin air; he was picked because he could cope with thin air. He had shown that during the Mexico Olympics in 1968, and Fifa knew he was fit enough to cope with Mexico\u2019s oppressive heat. England\u2019s Terry Cooper would lose 12 pounds in the match. For Klein it was squeaky-bum time in more ways than one. He still had the problem of being perceived as the boy scout in \u2018Nam. The players of Brazil and England did not know who he was. \u201cIn the first moment, they look me: \u2018Who is standing here in the middle of the field?\u2019 They knew nothing about me. I try from the first moment to respect the players; I look their eyes. A little later during the game they understood that they must also respect my refereeing.\u201d He controlled the game calmly from the first whistle. It flowed gracefully from end to end, a festival of goodwill and mutual respect, and is still one of the World Cup\u2019s iconic contests. \u201cA referee is feeling during the game and after the game, how is he refereeing, how is his performance. If you make a mistake, you alone know immediately. You feel it: you feel it because of the behaviour of the player, you feel it when you watch the coach. I\u2019m not talking about [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho; he always protests against the referees. You have some coaches who you respect. If they wave their hands once every 10 years you think about it. But I feel very good in that Brazil/England game.\u201d There were a couple of major incidents. Francis Lee was booked for a late challenge on the goalkeeper Felix; then, just before half-time, Pele fell in the area after a challenge from Alan Mullery. It would have been so easy, too easy, for a young referee to be seduced by the greatest player in the world. Klein simply waved play on. He later called it \u201cthe best decision of my life\u201d. His performance received universal and divine haskamah. \u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d said Pele, \u201cbut he always had total control of the action.\u201d In his Story of the World Cup, Brian Glanville said the game was \u201cadmirably refereed by the obscure Israeli referee Abraham Klein, an inspired appointment\u201d. What was most striking was his apparently effortless authority. Unlike some of the other great referees, Collina and Jack Taylor in particular, Klein did not have physical authority. He was 5ft 5in, a fraction over 10st. But he could impose himself in other ways. He was a big believer in body language; a firm handshake, a perfectly upright stance, a decisive signal or whistle; and eye contact, always eye contact. It soon became apparent he did not suffer insolence or indiscipline. He was the teacher you knew not to take liberties with. In a sense, his control was supernatural. After that Brazil game, the Fort Scot Tribute said he \u201cshowed he had the mysterious and decisive power to move into an explosive situation and calm then down by the simple exertion of cool authority\u201d. He could impose himself physically, in his own little way. Before one game, Klein was inspecting the footwear of a notorious troublemaker and decided to squeeze the player\u2019s wrist. \u201cI merely applied a little bit of pressure, ever so slight, so he knew I was making a point: we\u2019ll have no problems today, will we?\u201d During an NASL game, when Johan Cruyff was faffing, refusing to retreat 10 yards at a free-kick, Klein jolted him into compliance with a zesty blow of the whistle only a couple of yards from Cruyff\u2019s earlobe. \u201cYou either have authority or not,\u201d says Klein. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to give red cards. I feel that I was able to control the game and the players respect my decisions. I was very happy [that I did not have to give too many red cards]. I felt that the most important thing in the game is that the players respect me; if you gain their respect you can do what you want in the game.\u201d His control of games came in no small part from his amateur psychology. Later, after reading the work of Daniel Goleman, he could give it his own name: emotional intelligence. \u201cGoleman wrote in his book one thing which I think is very important: that to be successful in your life you need to have emotional intelligence. You have it or not; you cannot learn this; you cannot go to university for this. I know many people, many famous referees \u2013 I do not want to give you names as it is not very nice \u2013 who did not finish high school, yet they were excellent referees. They have emotional intelligence, because they feel what other people think, and can imagine what the other person is going to do. You have many politicians and businessmen: they are not intelligent, but they are very successful in what they do in their life. \u201cI think you can learn how to prove your authority, but you must have your authority in the first place. You can see it with Jack Taylor. I can\u2019t remember a player that has come close to him. He\u2019s a tall man, like a rock, and when he looks at players \u2013 they run away! He has it, you know. I don\u2019t know what he is doing today. Give my best regards to him, I love the gentleman. \u201cJack Taylor was the best referee I ever saw in my life. I learned a lot from him. I remember when he refereed the World Cup final in 1974 and awarded the penalty kick against West Germany, and Franz Beckenbauer just start to come close to him. I saw him stood like a rock with his hands waving, and Beckenbauer - one of the biggest players in the world \u2013 left immediately, he ran away from there. \u201cThis is the referee for me. Even if he makes a mistake, the players respect him, everybody respects him. This was [Pierluigi] Collina, this was Jack Taylor, this was [Karoly] Palotai, this was Leo Horn. These four referees in my opinion were the greatest referees.\u201d The authority of Klein\u2019s performance in the England/Brazil game impressed everybody. \u201cWhenever people introduce me, even now, they say, \u2018Abraham Klein who refereed England v Brazil\u2019, not Brazil v Italy or Italy v Argentina.\u201d The pride Klein takes in his career is evident throughout \u2013 not just on a personal level, but because of what he achieved on behalf of a small football country. After the game he paid a local photographer $100 - \u201cat the time it was big money for me\u201d - for a negative of him tossing the coin with Carlos Alberto and Bobby Moore. It is one of hundreds of items of memorabilia on display in a little museum at his home. It includes the match balls from England v Brazil in 1970 and Italy v Brazil in 1982; a series of cards on which he is photographed with the likes of Alberto, Moore, Dino Zoff and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge; rosettes; a silver plate signed by the Italy squad of 1982; a watch with a dedication from Ken Aston (\u201cyou never let me down, not as a referee and not as a friend\u201d; and even a toiletry bag from the Scottish FA. Every memento tells a story. He has a less welcome memory of the 1970 World Cup: Montezuma\u2019s revenge, which meant he had to pull out after originally being awarded the quarter-final between Italy and Mexico. \u201cI was very, very, very upset because I feel good after the Brazil game.\u201d His mood was improved when Sir Stanley Rous told him: \u201cIt\u2019s not your last World Cup.\u201d Klein was paid \u00a310 for refereeing the game. In the future he was lucky to get that; at the 1982 World Cup the referees were paid only expenses. Back then \u2013 and this will be hard for younger readers to understand \u2013 people really did do it for the love of the game. He never gave up his day job as a PE teacher. \u201cMoney for me was not important. To have a game like England-Brazil or Italy-Brazil is much more than a million dollars. Believe me, if I had a million dollars at that time and they asked me if I want pay a million dollars to referee Brazil v England, I would write a cheque. It changed my life.\u201d It not only changed his life; it came to define it. \u201cI feel very good with this, believe me. I live this game all my life, more than any other game.\u201d A great and serious mistake The letter cut straight to the point. It was written in 1995 by Ken Aston, the former chairman of the Fifa Referees\u2019 Committee, and addressed to Klein.  \u201cThanks you for your book \u2026 It is a great shame that you made a great mistake in your refereeing career. A very serious mistake which you could never recover, and one which everyone connected with the appointment of referees at international level remembered. And what you ask was this great and serious mistake? Simply that you were an Israeli. I must tell you that had I still been chairman of the Fifa Referees\u2019 Committee in 1982, you would without any doubt have been carrying the whistle and not the flag. I was happy to have been able to support you throughout your career simply because you deserve such support.\u201d  Politics cost Klein the World Cup final in 1978 (and perhaps 1982), a place in the 1974 tournament, and permeated his career. There was, at first, a mistrust of a referee from a small league, although that kind of prejudice was the least of Klein\u2019s worries. In 1981, when he went to French Guiana as part of the Fifa Coca-Cola Project, he was originally refused admission because Israelis were not allowed. When the rest of the Fifa party said they would get on the first return flight unless Klein was allowed in, the authorities relented. Far more damagingly, the Munich massacre of 1972, in which members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and killed, meant it was not safe for Klein to go to West Germany for the World Cup two years later. Israel did not become a member of Uefa until 1990, so there was no chance for Klein to officiate major European league games. He does not have any grievance and says that Fifa \u201cwere 100% correct with me\u201d. If he couldn\u2019t quite access all areas, he at least got to go backstage. \u201cNo Israeli was allowed to officiate in the east countries in Europe, but I refereed USSR twice. I also refereed Cuba v Poland in the opening game in the Montreal Olympics, all the communist countries I was not allowed to enter. Fifa let me referee these nations when they play abroad.\u201d He also refereed the Intercontinental Cup match between Nottingham Forest and Nacional in 1980. Klein became a whistle for hire (although \u2018hired\u2019 is a generous term given the amount he was usually paid). He refereed around 100 NASL games in four seasons, and covered nine games at the Mini World Cup in 1972, six as referee - including a quarter-final, semi-final and the final \u2013 and three as linesman. This was a particularly impressive achievement; shortly before the tournament Klein lacerated a muscle, had to put his leg in a cast and was told to forget about participating. There was also a seriously awkward World Cup qualifier between Italy and England in 1976). There had been a climate of mutual mistrust for years, which exploded in a nasty match at the US Bicentennial Tournament six months earlier. With the stakes so much higher in Rome, Fifa called for its top man. The Sunday Mirror described Klein as \u201cthe man with the most unenviable job in football\u201d. He dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d reports that he had been visited at his home by Italians, and said simply: \u201cThe game doesn\u2019t worry me.\u201d It worried almost everyone else. A bit of the old ultraviolence seemed inevitable. \u201cIf all that Abraham Klein has to watch this afternoon is tongues,\u201d wrote David Lacey on the day of the match in the Guardian, \u201che will be fortunate.\u201d Klein, on advice from Aston, used the advantage sparingly. It meant more fouls than usual \u2013 48- but a game that never got out of hand. \u201cThe game, while hard, was refereed firmly and sensibly by the Israeli Abraham Klein \u2026 who was quick to clamp down on anything that might provoke retaliation,\u201d said Lacey in this paper. The Mirror said he ruled \u201cwith an iron hand\u201d. Klein\u2019s excellence gave a lie to the old adage to the referee should be invisible. You couldn\u2019t fail to notice that you hadn\u2019t noticed him. Instead of becoming notorious, the match is now remembered for a classic goal from Roberto Bettega in Italy\u2019s 2-0 win. After the game, he received another letter from Ken Aston:  19 November 1976 My dear Abraham, Bravo, well done. Mrs Aston said to me, \u2018Abraham didn\u2019t let you down\u2019, and she knows how important it is to me. The fact that England lost does not perturb me in the least; it might be said that Italy were the better team, and certainly they were, but the best team was the third team of match officials. Please pass on to your two colleagues my congratulation \u2026  Klein covered so many great games around the world. But he never refereed a World Cup final. A real hero  The English tabloids have not always been known for their support of foreign referees. The hounding of Urs Meier after Euro 2004 was a disgrace, while Tom Henning \u00d8vreb\u00f8 was openly ridiculed when he made a mess of the 2009 Champions League semi-final between Barcelona and Chelsea. Thirty-one years earlier, the tabloids had only kind words for Klein. Particularly the Daily Mirror. \u201cThe first authentic hero of the 1978 World Cup has emerged at last \u2013 and it is not a pampered, overpaid professional footballer,\u201d wrote Frank McGhee under the headline \u2018Abraham restores our faith\u2019. \u201cHe is Abraham Klein of Israel.\u201d Klein was praised worldwide for his immaculate performance in the group game between Italy and the hosts Argentina. With both teams having qualified for the second phase, it might have seemed like a nice easy dead rubber. It didn\u2019t quite pan out that way. Klein says it was the most difficult game of his career. At the time Argentina was run by a military junta, and the sense persisted that anybody else winning the World Cup was simply not an option. After they beat Holland in the final, one of the Dutch players said that his side would not have got out of the stadium alive had they won. He was only half joking. You can\u2019t overestimate how intimidating it was. In Argentina\u2019s first two games, 2-1 victories over Hungary and France, the referees had caved in to the relentless pressure of 77,000 shrieking fans. Hungary had two players sent off; France conceded a dodgy penalty and didn\u2019t get a much clearer penalty of their own. \u201cYou can ask Platini what he thinks about that game,\u201d says Klein. \u201cYou can ask Hungary for their opinion about that game.\u201d Argentina needed to beat Italy to stay in Buenos Aires for the second group stage. In his History of the World Cup, Cris Freddi said that Argentina\u2019s \u201cexcesses were kept in check by the best referee in the world\u201d. Italy won 1-0. \u201cThe crowd were very upset. I had no problem with the players; they respect me. The crowd, you know, they pay and when they pay they can tell you whatever they think about you and your mother.\u201d Klein turned down a couple of penalty appeals just before the break, which led to vicious abuse either side of half-time. This time his hands were not in his pockets. He strode off the pitch knowing he had made the right decisions, a proud monument of conviction and moral courage. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the pitch, only two things are important to me: being fair to both teams and making my decisions bravely,\u201d he told Simon Kuper in Ajax, The Dutch, The War. \u201cI think all referees are fair, but not all of them are brave, probably.\u201d He looked the beast in the eye and did not blink. \u201cThere was nothing more impressive in this World Cup,\u201d wrote Brian Glanville, \u201cthan the way he stood between his linesmen at half-time in the Argentina-Italy game, scorning the banshee whistling of the incensed crowd.\u201d This is not to say Klein was entirely unaffected by the abuse. He is human and he needs not to be hated. \u201cThe feeling is very bad,\u201d he says of his reaction at half-time. To avert a similar reception, he decided to delay his return on to the field. Instead of leading the players out, he let the Argentina players go first; his return was lost in the hero worship. It was an ingenious and highly successful manoeuvre. \u201cI felt stronger in the second half because I know all my decisions were correct. I feel very good with this. Even after the game, they told me, \u2018don\u2019t go out, the crowd is waiting for you\u2019. I told them, \u2018I\u2019m not afraid\u2019. I was never afraid in my career. I know that the crowd will do nothing after the game. I was not afraid to do what a referee must do in the game. There was no problem.\u201d He keeps a scrapbook full of praise for his performance:  \u2018Diesmal kein Heimschiedsrichter\u2019 (\u201cNo home-favouring ref this time\u201d). \u201cAbraham Klein from Israel, who was unwaveringly insistent on applying the laws as they were written - with the resultant hail of abuse from the home country, when they lost, and widespread acclaim in Europe. Ironically, his brave, conspicuous performance robbed Klein of his rightful claim to the final.\u201d (From The Argentina Story by David Miller) \u2018Il miglior fischietto \u00e8 Klein\u2019 (\u201cThe best referee is Klein\u201d) \u201cI hope the brave, little Israeli ref, Abraham Klein, gets the final.\u201d (Brian Glanville in the Sunday Times) \u2018Ganz gross, Herr Klein!\u2019 (\u201cFabulous, Mr Klein!\u201d)   The comments were echoed in the Guardian. \u201cItaly produced a marvellously balanced and co-ordinated performance to beat Argentina,\u201d wrote David Lacey, \u201cand much of the credit for creating the circumstances in which they were allowed to do so must go to Abraham Klein, of Israel, whose firm, fair refereeing was precisely what the situation demanded.\u201d In the Mirror, Frank McGhee said \u201che didn\u2019t make a single wrong decision in the whole 90 minutes of a marvellous match \u2026 My most abiding memory of the match is the way both teams queued up at the end to shake hands with Klein. They knew, we knew, he had done most to make it a match to remember.\u201d After another excellent performance in the second group stage match between \u2013 of all teams - Austria and West Germany, he seemed a certainty for the final. Pele thought it; Jack Taylor thought it; even educated fleas thought it. But it went to the Italian Sergio Gonella \u2013 reportedly on the casting vote of another Italian, Dr Artemio Franchi, the chairman of the referees\u2019 committee. Klein\u2019s consolation prize was the third-place play-off between Brazil and Italy. Clive Thomas, the Welshman who also referred at the tournament, called the decision an \u201cutter disgrace\u201d. Cris Freddi also described it as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in his World Cup history. \u201cTo tell you the truth I was very disappointed,\u201d Klein says. \u201cI think at that time I was fit to referee the final. But only one man can referee the final, and if I look back I am still happy with what I had in my life, in my refereeing life.\u201d Klein is certain he would have had no problem being impartial, despite his affection for Apeldoorn. Gonella lost control of the match even before it started, with the kick-off delayed by over 10 minutes by Argentinian gamesmanship. First they came on to the field late; then they complained about the bandage on Rene van de Kerkhof\u2019s arm, even though he had been wearing it all tournament. The match was a nasty affair. Argentina did what they had been doing most of the tournament; Holland showed us why Netherlands is all but an anagram of neanderthals. There are a couple of theories for Klein\u2019s rejection. One is that Argentina protested about his links with Holland. It sounds good, but at that stage nobody knew of his year in Apeldoorn. \u201cNobody knew because nobody asked me,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody at the Argentinian government or Fifa knows about it, so this cannot be true.\u201d More likely is that he was punished for his performance in the Italy game; that Argentina bullied Fifa into picking another referee. \u201cMaybe this was the reason,\u201d he says. Either way, there is a startling lack of bitterness. \u201cSome of the journalists told that some of the members of the referees\u2019 committee wanted me, but I cannot tell you one wrong about the referees\u2019 committee or the Fifa president. They support me throughout my career. You cannot find many referees from small countries who had the games that I had. I refereed Brazil seven times, Italy seven times. They gave me the best games in the world. Maybe Gonella was better than me.\u201d The bell rings Klein knew about control. For over a decade, he had controlled the best players in the world. He thought he knew about control. He was wrong. \u201cIt is the one time I lost control,\u201d he said. He was sat in a hotel in Spain, preparing for the World Cup. He had no idea where his son was, or whether he was alive. After 1978, Klein was due a quiet, trouble-free World Cup. Some chance. First came yet more politics. With Kuwait and Algeria having qualified, Arab TV stations threatened to boycott the World Cup if an Israeli was allowed to referee. On 15 March, when the referees list was to be announced, Klein paced around the room like a teenager waiting for a call from the one they mistakenly thought was The One. \u201cI kept fiddling and checking my phone,\u201d he recalled in Master of the Whistle. \u201cIs my line connected? Do I have a dial tone? As time passed by I have gotten more nervous, more morose. I was in agony and felt I was going crazy.\u201d A few hours later came relief: Klein\u2019s candidacy had been unanimously approved by Fifa\u2019s referees committee, who had reached a compromise: his name would be erased from the screen during broadcasts to Arab countries. After more bureaucracy \u2013 the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports originally rejected his application for leave \u2013 Klein prepared to depart for Spain. Then things took a darker twist. Palestinian terrorists shot Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador for England, in the head. He was in a coma for three months. Retaliation was inevitable. Klein\u2019s first born, Amit, was on active duty, but he reasoned with himself that a new recruit would not be in the firing line. He landed in Spain and settled in for a few days. Then the phone rang on 6 June; his wife told him that the war was on in Lebanon, and that Amit was on standby. \u201cSuddenly I went through a range of emotions that I never felt before; a worry mixed with fear,\u201d he wrote in Master of the Whistle. \u201cMy body got numb and a cold sweat started to cover me head to toe. All I could do was to sit on my bed, feel sorry for Amit and for myself. And then uncontrollable tears started to come down my cheeks. For the first time in my life I was not in control; I lost it and it was a feeling I could not bear.\u201d The next day Klein found out that his son was in combat in the hot spot of Damour. He requested a meeting with Dr Franchi, the chairman of the referees\u2019 committee, and told he was in no fit state to referee a game. \u201c\u2019Are you sure about this?\u2019, he asked. \u2018Yes I am 100% sure. My son is in combat in Lebanon. My family has not heard from him. We have sign, no word, whether he is alive. I am extremely worried about him and his whereabouts and therefore I do not feel like I am in the proper state of mind to referee a World Cup game.\u2019\u201d Klein spent the first round as either linesman or fourth official. For nearly two weeks he had no word of his son. On 18 June he ran the line in Italy v Peru. \u201cI did my job while my mind was floating. I felt like I was enclosed in some space bubble. Mostly my thoughts were with Amit.\u201d That evening he returned to his hotel to find a letter waiting for him at reception.  Shalom dear dad, Today is Friday and as you know it happens to be my birthday. I am celebrating it here in far away Lebanon. Everybody got recruited and called in. The Core of Engineers has been operating on the Litani for three weeks. Sadly a lot of guys that I knew got either killed or seriously wounded and my heart is broken. I am already waiting impatiently to see a World Cup game refereed by you (I wish to see you referee many games as well as the final). Here, everybody is collecting newspaper clips about the games and passes them on to me. Much success! We are all crossing our fingers for your success. Love, Amit.\u201d.  \u201cI could not stop my tears,\u201d said Klein. \u201cIt is difficult to explain to someone the emotions that father goes through when reading a letter from his son in combat. What a difference a sign of life in the form of a small letter can make on a parent.\u201d Later he heard his son\u2019s voice for the first time since arriving in Spain. \u201cWhen the phone rang in my hotel room and I heard Amit\u2019s voice on the other side I thought I was hallucinating: how the heck he has managed to reach me on the phone in the middle of a war to communicate with me? It was one of the most exciting phone conversations that I had ever had in my life. He was not on the front combat lines as I had assumed but his unit had done a considerable mileage on foot in search of the hidden enemy.\u201d His son implored Klein to return to refereeing. Amit Klein would go on to become an international referee himself, and today he is a Uefa observer. His old man wasn\u2019t quite finished yet. He had been assigned to Brazil v Italy in the second stage. The magnificent Brazilians needed a draw to reach the semi-finals; an unconvincing Italy needed to win. Klein was peculiarly unexcited. He thought Brazil would win easily. He told his two linesman that \u201cit will be a game that nobody will remember in a few months\u201d. \u201cHow wrong was I?\u201d he reflects. He never refereed a World Cup final, but perhaps the greatest game in World Cup history is a decent alternative. When Paolo Rossi scored his second goal to put Italy 2-1 up after 25 minutes, Klein says \u201cthe bell rang\u201d in his head. \u201cI realised that I was part of history in the making.\u201d The heat and end-to-end nature of the game would have been too much for most 48-year-olds, but Klein\u2019s fitness served him well. With the score 1-1, Brazil appealed for a penalty when Claudio Gentile pulled Zico\u2019s shirt so hard that he almost ripped it off. The linesman had flagged a second earlier for offside, however. \u201cIf the linesman\u2019s flag would not have been raised to indicate an offside call I would have whistled without a hesitation for a penalty and given Gentile a second yellow card. However, Zico had a hard time accepting my decision. He was furious with me and continued to show me again and again the great tear in his shirt. \u2018So go change your shirt\u2019 I told him in return.\u201d Italy went on to win an epic match 3-2, despite a furious late assault from Brazil that included Zoff\u2019s save on the line from Oscar. \u201cIt was an invasion, like in Normandy, with all the players,\u201d he remembers. Again he seemed a likely candidate for the final, but Fifa went for Arnaldo Coelho. \u201cThe obvious choice was Abraham Klein,\u201d said Brian Glanville in his Story of the World Cup. \u201cBut the Referees\u2019 Committee, pleased with itself and as incompetent as ever, compromised pathetically by assigning Klein to \u2026 the replay.\u201d Klein was appointed linesman for the first final. \u201cIn 82, the best referee of the tournament was Coelho, and I was very happy that I was on the line,\u201d he says. \u201cI was the first man to congratulate him and I told him I was very happy I was with him.\u201d Had there been a replay, Klein would have refereed the World Cup final at the age of 48. Italy won 3-1. So now then  Klein retired in 1984, at the age of 50. He would later be chairman of the referees committee in Israel, and a Fifa referees instructor. He also refereed at the Special Olympics in 1995 and 1999. Now 77, he has the chance to experience the globe, not just colour it in on a map, and to enjoy the friendships fostered through football. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat refereeing has done for me is not only about the games, and not only that I saw the world \u2013 because when I was a referee I travelled around the world but I didn\u2019t see nothing from the world. Today if I land anywhere in the world somebody is waiting for me. It\u2019s a good feeling, and when they come to Israel I do the same, believe me.\u201d He goes everywhere with his wife Bracha. \u201cI have a wonderful wife, believe me. She accompanies me around the world.\u201d Last year they went on a cruise from Rome, first stopping off at the same hotel that Klein had stayed in before the Poland game in 1965. \u201cIn reception there was a man, not old but maybe 60. I give him my passport He look my passport, he look my passport, he look my face. \u201882, Italia-Brasil!\u2019 He look me. I told him, \u2018Yes, Italia-Brasil\u2019. He give me my key. It was a pre-paid room. We get the lift and go to our room. It was a suite, an unbelievable suite. I told my wife, we go back to the luggage, it was a mistake. I did not pay for a suite, I pay for an ordinary room. I go back, I told him, \u2018We are very sorry, I pay for another room\u2019. \u2018Nonononono, it is our great pleasure that you stay in our hotel\u2019. Then he sent to our room wine and chocolate. Unbelievable.\u201d Klein still lives in Haifa, close to his daughter and his granddaughters. \u201cI am living in an apartment hotel, very close to the sea. I feel the winter air.\u201d He still does around three hours\u2019 exercise a day: swimming, gym work or just walking along the bench. Even now, as he approaches his ninth decade on earth, he sticks to his fighting weight. \u201cI am very fit today. I am 65 kilos (just over 10st), the same as when I refereed England v Brazil. When I go on a cruise I put on two or three kilos because they feed you 24 hours a day, but when I get home I work it off. I am a very rich man. You know why? I don\u2019t need to buy any clothes! Not the same shoes but the same clothes \u2026\u201d Then there are the leisure pursuits for which there was so little time during his career. \u201cI tell you I am very busy. I am busy with my training, with my family, with reading books, going to concerts or the opera, meeting friends. I love sport, I play tennis I watch sport every day, NBA, English football. I am a happy man I can tell you, very happy. And if I am looking back, I am very happy with my career. Very, very happy.\u201d There is no arrogance, just pride and still, perhaps, a hint of incredulity at this unbelievable life. He does not need the validation of being called the best referee of all time. He gets validation every time he looks in his museum, or every time he flies to a different part of the world and is introduced as the man who refereed England v Brazil in 1970. It\u2019s enough to say that Klein was one of the greatest referees of all time. And that he has lived a life like no other. Thanks to Abraham Klein, Dan Friedman and Cris Freddi.

Some Beitar Jerusalem fans, the country&apos;s notoriously violent supporters stand accused of stabbing one man and assaulting several others in a mass attack on the shopping centre&apos;s Palestinian staff and customers. The police have not yet launched an investigation into the incident because an official complaint has not been lodged. Israel&apos;s Ha&apos;aretz newspaper described the incident as &quot;Jerusalem&apos;s biggest ever ethnic clashes&quot;. &quot;How can we arrest someone when there have been no complaints made? There have been no reports of injuries or that anyone was spoken to in [a racist] way,&quot; said Micky Rosenfeld, an Israel police spokesman. Even so, Rosenfeld added, police will begin examining CCTV footage next week. &quot;Normally, members of the public would have come forward within hours to make an official complaint. Until now, none has been made.&quot; Shortly before 10pm on Monday, after a match at Teddy Stadium between Beitar football club and Maccabi Tel Aviv, supporters of the Jerusalem club flooded into the food hall at the neighbouring mall. Witnesses quoted in Haaretz say that hundreds of teenage supporters surged into the second floor food hall, hurling abuse at Palestinian cleaners and chanting anti-Arab slogans. Several Palestinian women eating there with their children were harassed by youths who spat in their food, it is claimed. Arab staff managed to chase the assailants away but were then beaten back as the mob returned. One man was surrounded and attacked by around 20 youths. A senior Malcha mall employee who witnessed the event confirmed the shopping centre&apos;s considerable private security force was overwhelmed by more than 300 troublemakers who were &quot;verbally and physically attacking Arabs&quot;. Within 40 minutes, police had arrived in large numbers, the mall was evacuated and the situation brought under control. A waitress at Malcha&apos;s Apropos restaurant told the Guardian: &quot;Everyone was shouting, screaming and running about the place. It was crazy. After around half an hour the security evacuated us. I heard that someone was stabbed.&quot; She said she had never seen such violent scenes at the shopping centre before, despite its proximity to the football stadium. &quot;It was scary at first but we have not got excited about this because we know these fans; they are known to be very aggressive&quot;.

Tax breaks for games developers in last week&apos;s budget is one example. Another, which hasn&apos;t had quite so much coverage is the announcement of a Connected Digital Economy Catapult (CDEC): an interdisciplinary research and development centre bringing together leading players from the media, internet, computing and communications sectors to develop innovative products, services and experiences. CDEC will be supported by a multi-million pound investment from the Technology Strategy Board, which is currently inviting potential partners from the creative industries to help shape the vision for this UK version of MIT&apos;s Media Lab. One place that it might be worth looking to for inspiration is Israel. I recently joined a group of digital media executives on a trade mission to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem led by creative industries minister, Ed Vaizey. What became clear from the visit was that the Israelis are rapidly becoming leaders in just about every area of the emerging digital economy: cross platform format development, trans-media production, search marketing, social media and online advertising, applications of metadata, game development, online commerce. One of the entrepreneurs we met, who had recently sold his company Lab Pixies to Google, described the ingredients of the cocktail driving the rapid growth of the sector. It has its origins, he said, in the joint effects of national military service and a persecution complex: &quot;Not just talent but tenacity, insatiable questioning of authority, determined informality, unique attitude towards failure, teamwork, mission, risk and cross-disciplinary creativity.&quot; The theme of interdisciplinary creativity was a constant reference point during the four-day visit. It was most persuasively expounded by Erel Margalit, a founding partner at Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), a $900m investment fund that has helped to create some of the largest companies to come out of Israel over the past eighteen years. &quot;People misread Israel&apos;s competitive advantage,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not technology, it is creativity.&quot; Margalit spoke to the delegation at JVP&apos;s Media Quarter, a converted Bauhaus building built by the British as the national Mint, which houses a media lab and technology incubator, a dozen start-up and portfolio companies, a performing arts hub, and a social profit organization. The vision is to fuse technology, creativity and social action in one complex as a hub for innovation. JVP&apos;s success as the most profitable investment group in Israel is, says Margalit, based on the insight that it is innovators and entrepreneurs from creative industries backgrounds who will drive the development of products and services that people will want to use, to own and to pay for. &quot;The club where one engineer meets another engineer and a company is created needs to widen,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to bring in writers, advertisers, story-tellers.&quot; The value of combining the artist&apos;s or designer&apos;s approach to creative development with technological R&amp;D was echoed at a reception at Microsoft&apos;s R&amp;D Centre in Tel Aviv. They&apos;ve clearly learned something as they&apos;ve watched Apple overtake them as the most valuable tech company in the world. The centre&apos;s director Zack Weisfeld listed seven key drivers of their innovation process; the last one, which he insisted was critical to all their R&amp;D efforts, was &quot;design matters&quot;. Weisfeld was followed on stage by a team from Shenkar College of Engineering and Design. They all echoed his theme: if R&amp;D and innovation processes are to result in products and services that people will love, if they are to create magic, they need to combine design creativity with engineering excellence. Neither is enough on its own. UK companies across the media and technology sectors could learn much from their Israeli counterparts. We may not have the advantage of the huge investment in military technology but we can emulate the fusion of deep technical expertise, creative imagination and commitment to design excellence with a mastery of business skills which are driving Israel&apos;s digital economy. The future success of the digital economy will depend on the geek, the luvvie and the barrow boy learning to understand each other and work together. If the TSB gets it right, CDEC will be a key catalyst for that kind of interdisciplinary collaboration and help to ensure that the UK remains a major player in the new media market place.

For Europe&apos;s far-right parties the rally, coming so soon after the murders in south-west France by a self-professed al-Qaida-following Muslim, marks a moment rich with potential political capital. Yet it&apos;s also a delicate one, especially for Marine Le Pen. Well before the killings, Le Pen was assiduously courting Jews, even while her father and founder of the National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was last month convicted of contesting crimes against humanity for saying that the Nazi occupation of France &quot;wasn&apos;t particularly inhumane&quot;. Marine must disassociate herself from such sentiments without repudiating her father personally or alienating his supporters. To do so she&apos;s laced her oft-expressed Islamophobia (parts of France, she&apos;s said, are suffering a kind of Muslim &quot;occupation&quot;) with a newfound &quot;philozionism&quot; (love of Zionism), which has extended even to hobnobbing with Israel&apos;s UN ambassador. Almost all European far-right parties have come up with the same toxic cocktail. The Dutch MP Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Freedom party, has compared the Qur&apos;an to Mein\u00a0Kampf. In Tel Aviv in 2010, he declared that &quot;Islam threatens not only\u00a0Israel, Islam threatens the whole world. If Jerusalem falls today, Athens and Rome, Amsterdam and Paris will fall\u00a0tomorrow.&quot; Meanwhile Filip Dewinter, leader of Belgium&apos;s Vlaams Belang party, which grew out of the Vlaams Blok Flemish nationalist party, many of whose members collaborated with the Nazis during the second world war, has proposed a quota on the number of young Belgian-born Muslims allowed in public swimming pools. Dewinter calls Judaism &quot;a pillar of European society&quot;, yet associates with antisemites, while claiming that &quot;multi-culture ... like Aids weakens the resistance of the European body&quot;, and &quot;Islamophobia is a duty&quot;. But the most rabidly Islamophobic European philozionist is Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Austrian Freedom party, who compared foreigners to harmful insects and consorts with neo-Nazis. And yet where do we find Strache in December 2010? In Jerusalem alongside Dewinter, supporting Israel&apos;s right to defend itself. In Scandinavia the anti-immigrant Danish People&apos;s party is a vocal supporter of Israel. And Siv Jensen, leader of the Norwegian Progress party and staunch supporter of Israel, has warned of the stealthy Islamicisation of Norway. In Britain EDL leader Tommy Robinson, in his first public speech, sported a star of David. At anti-immigrant rallies, EDL banners read: &quot;There is no place for Fascist Islamic Jew Haters in England&quot;. So has the Jew, that fabled rootless cosmopolitan, now suddenly become the embodiment of European culture, the &quot;us&quot; against which the Muslim can be cast as &quot;them&quot;? It&apos;s not so simple. For a start, &quot;traditional&quot; antisemitism hasn&apos;t exactly evaporated. Look at Hungary, whose ultra-nationalist Jobbik party is unapologetically Holocaust-denying, or Lithuania, where revisionist MPs claim that the Jews were as responsible as the Nazis for the second world war. What&apos;s more, the &quot;philosemite&quot;, who professes to love Jews and attributes superior intelligence and culture to them, is often (though not always) another incarnation of the antisemite, who projects negative qualities on to them: both see &quot;the Jew&quot; as a unified racial category. Beneath the admiring surface, philozionism isn&apos;t really an appreciation of Jewish culture but rather the opportunistic endorsement of Israeli nationalism and power. Indeed you can blithely sign up to both antisemitism and philozionism. Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik described himself as &quot;pro-Zionist&quot; while claiming that Europe has a &quot;considerable Jewish problem&quot;; he saw himself as simultaneously anti-Nazi and pro-monoculturalism. The British National party&apos;s Nick Griffin once called the Holocaust the &quot;Holohoax&quot;, subsequently supported Israel in its war &quot;against the terrorists&quot;, but the day after the Oslo murders tweeted disparagingly that Breivik was a &quot;Zionist&quot;. Most Jews, apart from the Israeli right wing, aren&apos;t fooled. They see the whole iconography of Nazism \u2013 vermin and foreign bodies, infectious diseases and alien values \u2013 pressed into service once again, but this time directed at Muslims. They understand that &quot;my enemy&apos;s enemy&quot; can easily mutate into &quot;with friends like these ...&quot;. The philozionism of European nationalist parties has been scrutinised most closely by Adar Primor, the foreign editor of Haaretz newspaper, who insists that &quot;they have not genuinely cast off their spiritual DNA, and ... aren&apos;t\u00a0looking for anything except for Jewish absolution that will bring them closer to political power.&quot; Similarly Dave Rich, spokesman of the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors antisemitic incidents in Britain, told me that far-right philosemites &quot;must think we&apos;re pretty stupid if they think we&apos;ll get taken in by that. The moment their perceived political gain disappears they revert to type. We completely reject their idea that they hate Muslims so they like Jews. What targets one community at one time can very easily move on to target another community if the climate changes.&quot; Rich&apos;s words, spoken before the murder of Jews in Toulouse, now sound chillingly prescient. The president of the French Jewish community, Richard Pasquier, judges Marine Le Pen more dangerous than her father. French Muslim leaders rallied round\u00a0Jewish communities last week. Next week sees the start of Passover, a festival celebrating the liberation of Jews from slavery in Egypt, when Jews often think about modern examples of oppression. Let&apos;s hope that French Jewish leaders use the occasion to rally\u00a0round Muslim communities, and\u00a0to\u00a0remember that ultimately, racism\u00a0is indiscriminate. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 March 2012.

Though normally no more high-brow, Israel&apos;s equivalent has this year achieved a surprising twist, by making a superstar out of &quot;Palestine sympathiser&quot; Saar Szekely. Szekely, 27, is the wild-card candidate whose stated objective was to voice leftwing views on prime-time television. In a house full of reactionaries and with a predominantly rightwing audience, Szekely&apos;s mission looked certain to be short-lived. But for all the Facebook pages clamouring for his annihilation, the Tel Aviv-based artist has made it to tomorrow night&apos;s final, and along the way become something of a heart-throb. Entering the house in January, Szekely was, for the first few weeks, overshadowed by the usual extreme eccentrics \u2013 a newlywed couple, a prostitute, a &quot;transfer-housemate&quot; from Big Brother Argentina. Nine weeks into the show, however, his conversations started to get more air time, and have become the focus of the series. &quot;I like the way he expresses himself,&quot; says one viewer, Shelly Malnick, 23, from Haifa. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything he says. There are harsh things he has said about soldiers that were really hard to listen to. But he doesn&apos;t stoop to bickering \u2013 he has a backbone and he never steps down from a well-mannered discussion. That is why most Israelis love him.&quot; It helps, she says, that he is &quot;very good looking&quot;. More leftwing viewers, needless to say, are smitten. But it was the development of his unlikely friendship with housemate Eran Tartakovsky \u2013 a former Israeli army officer \u2013 that, according to the Maariv Daily&apos;s deputy editor, Shai Golden, sparked Szekely&apos;s success. &quot;Eran embracing him was like giving him a kosher stamp,&quot; said Golden. Eran, who claimed in his audition tape to hate Arabs &quot;in the same way that i hate cancer, because one day it might kill me&quot;, was Szekely&apos;s hawkish counterpart on the show. But the ploy backfired when the pair bonded: &quot;They became close. It took the leftist extremism out of Saar and put the man in front.&quot; While the level of political debate in the UK&apos;s Big Brother has stalled at the racism saga involving Shilpa Shetty, or the violent scream-fest in 2004 \u2013 with Emma threatening to &quot;fucking kill&quot; Victor and Jason to &quot;rip the head off&quot; Marco, the Israeli version has become altogether more nuanced. Sunbathing with other housemates, Tartakovsky and Szekely would shift from daily chit-chat to the purpose of the Israeli army and back again. While other housemates stormed off, asking Tartakovsky in shock how he can listen to him &quot;call your friends murderers&quot;, Tartakovsky looked unfazed. &quot;They just have the most amazing conversations; very calm, very un-Big Brother-like,&quot; says Ami Kaufman, co-creator of 972 Magazine, that set one of Szekely&apos;s political debates viral on Twitter. &quot;I think that&apos;s one of the only things I like about this reality show: the dialogues are very representative of the political discourse that goes on in this country. Percentage-wise, it&apos;s probably the equivalent to what&apos;s going on outside the house as well. It is very symbolic of what is going on in Israel.&quot; Even bringing in another radical rightwinger, Tzvi Portal, halfway through the season failed to stoke the fire. Szekely was amiable towards the loud-mouthed Portal, who was soon evicted. Animosity towards Szekely, however, has been vocal. The debate Kaufman posted shows Szekely calling Ariel (an Israeli settlement city in the West Bank) &quot;a panhandle \u2026 intentionally designed to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state&quot;. Ariel responded by publishing its own disparaging statement against him. The backlash has extended to his hometown, Ashkelon. &quot;Usually,&quot; Kaufman explains, &quot;when people find out who the five finalists are, each of their hometowns goes into a big campaign to vote for the &apos;homeboy&apos;. This isn&apos;t happening now in Ashkelon, they&apos;re actually very ashamed of Saar Szekely. He doesn&apos;t represent them. He doesn&apos;t really represent many Israelis.&quot; But Golden thinks the mix has turned out a great success. &quot;Until now, reality TV in Israel has been reluctant to put politics in the forefront because it doesn&apos;t make for good entertainment,&quot; he says. &quot;I think there are two elements to Israelis&apos; obsession with reality TV: escapism and a substitute for violence. Putting Saar in was a real risk.&quot; Yoram Zak, producer of Big Brother, certainly has no regrets: &quot;I just really liked his style,&quot; he commented. &quot;When I asked him why he wanted to join the house he said, &apos;If you&apos;re going to broadcast this garbage the least I can do is bring some real content to it.&apos; I liked that.&quot; The series has so far received some of the highest viewer ratings Israeli TV has ever had (an average of three in 10 Israelis a night), not least because of the controversy created by Szekely. Though one of the frontrunners, general consensus is that his controversial views will deny him the title. But either way, there are wins in this story for Szekely, for Big Brother and for Israel. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 April 2012 because the original said Ariel is a district in Someron. Ariel is an Israeli settlement city in the West Bank. It was amended further on 4 April 2012 because Eran Tartakovsky&apos;s audition tape was translated as saying that he hated Arabs more than he hated cancer.

The people vote with their sandal-clad feet, which carry them from grocer&apos;s shop to cafe to golden mile of sand without the slightest inclination to walk into a synagogue \u2013 and in a free country it should be their cast-iron right to do just that. Yet the vagaries of a country defiantly defining itself along religious lines are disrupting the lives of millions of Israel&apos;s citizens every weekend, and there seems precious little the state is prepared to do about it. In February, the Tel Aviv municipality approved a resolution to petition the transport ministry to allow public transport to operate in the city on Shabbat (the Sabbath), but the idea was rejected outright by the transport minister Yisrael Katz. This week, members of the leftwing Meretz party took the case to the high court, arguing that Katz is obliged by Israeli law to consider the proposal. Given the secular character of the vast majority of Tel Aviv \u2013 whose roads heave with private cars round the clock, and whose beaches boast thousands of near-naked youths packed together like sardines every Shabbat \u2013 such a proposition seems hardly out of place. Yet the establishment is up in arms about the plans, and is mobilising its troops to prevent any change to the status quo. As is the case so often in internal Israeli politics, the religious factions are throwing a spanner in the works, with the likes of Tel Aviv chief rabbi Lau expressing his &quot;deep disappointment and pain&quot; at the idea that buses should run on the Sabbath. He is backed by not only his fellow zealots, but also by avowedly secular politicians, who are happy to scramble aboard a religious bandwagon (but not on Shabbat of course) as long as it suits their nationalist aims. Forbidding public transport on Shabbat is a decidedly hypocritical stance when everything from state TV to state FA-run football leagues to state-run public facilities are allowed to operate on Shabbat in direct contravention to religious law. Were Israel to rigidly enforce the laws of the Sabbath on its entire populace, there would be a revolution before the Shabbat siren could sound its first notes, as the government knows only too well. Instead, the state clings desperately to ludicrous notions that by banning public transport on Shabbat, the Jewish nature of the country is somehow reinforced, despite the majority of the population neither adhering to, nor caring about, religious laws and statutes. And that&apos;s just the Jewish citizens \u2013 as for non-Jewish Israelis, their rights mean even less when it comes to state provision of services in this instance. For those for whom Saturday is neither Sabbath nor sacred, why should they be denied the right to public transport on their one day off in the week, just to pander to the rights of one religious group? The answer is, of course, that the state is not interested in giving Christian and Muslim citizens any say in such matters \u2013 as rightwing politicians like to say: if you don&apos;t like the rules, no one is keeping you here, and don&apos;t forget to shut the door behind you when you leave. But the worm is turning, and Meretz&apos;s case in the high court will be a major test of Israel&apos;s self-proclaimed definition as a democratic state for all its citizens. The country being held hostage by religious parties is hardly news \u2013 the decades-old argument about national service for yeshiva students is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to secular-religious warfare. But in this case, the state is firmly on the side of the ultra-orthodox, albeit for different reasons. The moment that you argue that Israel should be entirely secular, and that there should be no religious trappings, you lose the case for Israel. Those who champion Israel as a Jewish state are compelled to require it to have a Jewish identity of some description, and in that context Shabbat is a major icon. But banning buses operating on Shabbat is shutting the stable door long after the horse has bolted down to the beachside cafe for a seafood salad. The vast majority of Israelis want the freedom to eat what they want, dress how they want, and travel where and when they want by whatever mode of transport is most suitable. For those who can&apos;t afford a car or taxi fare, cutting off public transport means isolating them on the one day a week when they most want the liberty to roam. Israel has to get over its obsession with its religious character, and fast. It must be a country for all its citizens, and if that means changing the status quo to suit the modern, secular demographic of cities such as Tel Aviv, then so be it. You can break Shabbat in a million ways in Tel Aviv, and making it a million and one by running buses to assist the poorer residents is hardly a game-changing proposition. And by doing so, non-Jewish citizens might just get a much-needed glimmer of hope that their needs are being catered for as well, rather than feeling perpetually second-class and sidelined. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-04-06T11:30:00Z", "title": "Time for Israel to allow buses on the Sabbath | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Walk around Tel Aviv on any given Saturday, and religious fervour is the last thing you&apos;ll encounter.", "In February, the Tel Aviv municipality approved a resolution to petition the transport ministry to allow public transport to operate in the city on Shabbat (the Sabbath), but the idea was rejected outright by the transport minister Yisrael Katz.", "Given the secular character of the vast majority of Tel Aviv \u2013 whose roads heave with private cars round the clock, and whose beaches boast thousands of near-naked youths packed together like sardines every Shabbat \u2013 such a proposition seems hardly out of place.", "As is the case so often in internal Israeli politics, the religious factions are throwing a spanner in the works, with the likes of Tel Aviv chief rabbi Lau expressing his &quot;deep disappointment and pain&quot; at the idea that buses should run on the Sabbath.", "It must be a country for all its citizens, and if that means changing the status quo to suit the modern, secular demographic of cities such as Tel Aviv, then so be it.", "You can break Shabbat in a million ways in Tel Aviv, and making it a million and one by running buses to assist the poorer residents is hardly a game-changing proposition."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/apr/06/sabbath-buses-israel"}, {"tags": ["Bauhaus", "Architecture", "Modernism", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Tom Wolfe", "Paul Klee", "Gustav Mahler"], "article": "Not much united Walter Ulbricht, the Stalinist dictator of East Germany for two decades, and Tom Wolfe, celebrant of the splendours and follies of American capitalist excess. Not much, except a loathing of the Bauhaus and the style of design it inspired. Ulbricht called it &quot;an expression of cosmopolitan building&quot; that was &quot;hostile to the people&quot; and to &quot;the national architectural heritage&quot;. Wolfe called it &quot;an architecture whose tenets prohibit every manifestation of exuberance, power, empire, grandeur or even high spirits and playfulness&quot;. For Ulbricht it was alien to Germany, for Wolfe it was alien to America. Both agreed that it was placeless, soulless and indifferent to ordinary people&apos;s needs. And if the Bauhaus attracted such consistent forms of hostility, that is due to the power and coherence of the image it presented to the world, of disciplined and monochrome modernist simplicity, usually involving steel and glass. Given that it was actually a short-lived and semi-nomadic school of design and art with the usual riot of individualists, visionaries, eccentrics, schemers and geniuses that such places attract, this appearance of unity was an achievement. From May the Barbican is staging an exhibition of 400 of the Bauhaus&apos;s works, the first in Britain on this scale for 44 years. It will stress the breadth of its output, including paintings by Paul Klee and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, furniture by Marcel Breuer, textiles by Gunta St\u00f6lzl, architecture by Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, photography, film, ceramics, theatre, graphics and product design. It promises to portray the central ideal of the Bauhaus, &quot;to change society in the aftermath of the first world war&quot;, as the Barbican puts it, and &quot;to find a new way of living&quot;. When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1919 it was with these aspirations for a new life, and for a multiplicity of creative disciplines, together with a stress on the importance of making things as opposed to just theorising about them. But there was not yet a distinct form or direction to these ideas, and almost anything could be considered as a route to a better future, including new spiritualist religions and a strict vegetarian diet which had to be livened up with plenty of garlic. According to Gropius&apos;s spectacular wife Alma, whose other husbands and lovers included Gustav Mahler, Oskar Kokoschka and the writer Franz Werfel, the most distinctive feature of the Bauhaus in its early days was garlic on the breath. Certain questions were unresolved and intensely debated. Was craft or mass production more important? Could art and manufacturing be reconciled? Did individual expression impede service to society? In 1925 the school moved to Dessau, between Berlin and Leipzig. At the time it was an industrial boom town, the base of the Junkers aeroplane company. The harder-edged, more technocratic arguments started to prevail. The young Marcel Breuer started collaborating with Junkers on making tubular steel furniture of a kind that would eventually become commonplace in boardrooms and forward-thinking homes. Greater attention was paid to the commercial development and marketing of Bauhaus-designed objects. In Dessau they built, in the extraordinarily short time of one year, the Gropius-designed building that became as famous as the institution it served. With its glass curtain walls and spare rectilinear forms, it crystallised what would become the dominant type of modernist architecture. It was one of the most prodigiously influential buildings of all time, a prototype that would be followed by office buildings, hotels, schools and hospitals in almost any country you can think of. In Dessau, Gropius and his followers could also try out other architectural ideas on the row of houses built for Bauhaus masters, and on 300 low-cost houses built for industrial workers on the Dessau-Torten estate. In 1932, however, the school moved on again, to Berlin. The next year it fell victim to the National Socialists \u2013 another movement that, after the catastrophic trauma of the first world war, sought a new order and expressed itself through memorable visual imagery. Junkers started making Stuka divebombers, not Breuer chairs, and Dessau was all but flattened by bombing in 1945. The Bauhaus building was severely damaged, and only recently has been fully restored. But its influence spread. The Bauhausler diaspora, of ex-students and teachers building in the style they had learned, extended to Tel Aviv and Tokyo. Gropius migrated via London to the United States, where he became a professor at Harvard and designed the Pan Am building above New York&apos;s Grand Central station, much disliked for the way it imposed on the view down Park Avenue. He also designed the Playboy Club in London, prompting a new generation of radicals to denounce him for selling out. To visit the Bauhaus building now is to be struck again by the extraordinary way in which a single construction in a provincial town could have had so much effect. It is also to see nuances that, inevitably, imitators lost. For years the Bauhaus building was known to the wider world mostly through a few black-and-white photographs that stress its more easily copied details, but miss the point that it was a framework for the creative energy of the school. Its stairs, workshops and balconies were places of display as well as function, and its glass walls made a spectacle of its internal activities. One of the key spaces was an auditorium whose stage is connected to the communal canteen, thereby bringing together performance and life. It also has a subtle colour scheme, contrary to Wolfe&apos;s assertions that the Bauhaus was only interested in black, white and grey. If it looked like a factory it also had properties of a commune, a cult centre and a theatre. Although it was founded by Gropius, architecture was not at first the main point of the Bauhaus, and its vast legacy extends from graphics through product design to art. But architecture came to dominate the public image of the place, and the style of the building proved easier to record than the events that happened there. What Wolfe and Ulbricht railed against was its impact on the built environment. Which, if you only look at its form and not at its content, does indeed look sterile. Hopefully, the Barbican show will put this misconception right. As for Alma, she tired of the work ethic of her husband and his school. At least if Tom Lehrer is to believed. As &quot;Alma&quot;, his tribute to her, has it: But he would work late at the Bauhaus, And only came home now and then. She said, &quot;What am I running? A chow house? It&apos;s time to change partners again.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-04-13T10:55:00Z", "title": "Bauhaus: a blueprint for the future", "sentences": ["The Bauhausler diaspora, of ex-students and teachers building in the style they had learned, extended to Tel Aviv and Tokyo."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/13/bauhaus-dessau-barbican-rowan-moore"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza", "Gaza flotilla", "UK news"], "article": "Israel has forced low-cost airline Jet2.com to cancel the tickets of three women from Manchester intending to travel to Bethlehem via Tel Aviv this weekend for a gathering of pro-Palestinian activists. Jet2.com informed the women by email that the airline would refuse to carry them and no refund would be paid. The move follows pressure on airlines from Israel to ban known activists. One of the women, retired nurse Norma Turner, said Jet2.com had caved in to pressure. &quot;It never crossed my mind that Israel could stop people with British passports leaving British airports,&quot; she told the Guardian. Israel has promised to deny entry to hundreds of activists due to arrive at Tel Aviv airport on Sunday en route to the West Bank for a week of educational and cultural activities. Up to 2,000 mainly European sympathisers plan to board planes in what has been dubbed a &quot;flytilla&quot; in reference to previous attempts to breach the blockade of Gaza by flotillas of boats. Jet2.com&apos;s decision followed a similar move by the German carrier Lufthansa, which cancelled the tickets of dozens of activists on Thursday, saying it was complying with Israel&apos;s demand not to fly certain passengers to Tel Aviv. Other airlines are expected to follow suit. In an email sent to the three women, Jet2.com said it had been obliged to provide the Israeli authorities passengers&apos; names, dates of birth, passport numbers and nationalities. &quot;As a result of providing that information, Jet2.com has been informed by the Israeli authorities that you will not be not permitted to enter Israel. Consequently, if Jet2.com carries you to Israel, you will be refused entry and Jet2.com will be liable for both a fine and your return to Manchester,&quot; the email said. &quot;We regret that, in light of the decision taken by the Israeli authorities, we are unable to accept you for carriage to Israel on this occasion and your booking with Jet2.com has been cancelled.&quot; The airline apologised and said the cancellation was &quot;totally beyond our control&quot; but said the passengers would not be reimbursed. The Israeli authorities have warned they will not permit entry to &quot;hostile elements&quot; and &quot;provocateurs&quot;. It distributed &quot;no-fly&quot; lists of known activists to airlines, which were warned that they would be expected to bear the costs of flying activists back to their point of departure. &quot;The provocateurs will be dealt with in a determined and quick way,&quot; Israel&apos;s public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, said this week. &quot;If they arrive in Israel they will be identified, removed from the plane, their entry into Israel will be prevented and they will be moved to a detention facility until they are flown out of Israel.&quot; Hundreds of police will be deployed to Ben Gurion airport from Saturday night and flights carrying activists will be diverted to a smaller terminal, where security forces and immigration officials will check and question passengers. Israel&apos;s response was &quot;paranoid and hysterical&quot;, said Mazin Qumsiyeh, one of the organisers of the Welcome to Palestine programme and a university professor in Bethlehem. &quot;They simply don&apos;t want the world to know what&apos;s going on in Palestine.&quot; The activists say they will be open about their intention to travel directly in special buses from the airport to Bethlehem. Israel controls all entry points to the West Bank. A similar &quot;flytilla&quot; last July resulted in the detention and deportation of scores of activists. In May 2010, a flotilla of boats attempting to reach Gaza ended in Israeli forces shooting dead nine activists. The mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, told a press conference: &quot;These people are coming to talk about peace, they are not coming to wage war against Israel. They are coming to visit the Palestinian people who are under occupation and to talk to them and to help them because these people are isolated.&quot; Turner said she would seek legal advice on Jet2.com&apos;s move. &quot;I think the airline should honour its commitment.

Yet they think it&apos;s acceptable for theatre companies to tour there, because they feel sure that they will be part of Israel one day. Their letter perfectly illustrates why the last-resort measure of a boycott of complicit Israeli cultural institutions is necessary. Israel creates what it calls &quot;facts on the ground&quot; \u2013 settlements and their infrastructure \u2013 and expects these to be legitimised at a future date by the Palestinians, in a widely discredited &quot;peace&quot; process in which the powerful are confident they will eventually impose their will upon the dispossessed. The call by Palestinian civil society for boycott aims to achieve basic human rights and the implementation of international law. It is the weapon of the weak in a situation of decades-long oppression. We should all support it.Miranda Pennell and John SmithLondon  \u2022 The MPs&apos; letter is undermined by its geographical inaccuracy. They assert that the West Bank settlements where the Habima Theatre has been performing are &quot;close to the 1967 line&quot;, and more or less bound to become part of legitimate Israel in land swaps as part of a peace agreement. This somehow, it seems, makes Habima performing in illegal settlements OK. It is illegal at the moment but may not be later, so there is nothing to worry about? In any case, geography demolishes the argument. Ariel is 17km beyond the green line. This is a small country \u2013 another 34km gets you to the Jordanian border. Kiryat Arba, the other settlement where Habima performs, is almost half-way to the West Bank&apos;s border with Jordan. There is no way these settlements could be gifted to Israel in exchange for land elsewhere and still leave a viable Palestine state. This is, in any case, a non-argument. Israel has no intention of making peace and has successfully thwarted the &quot;peace process&quot; for 20 years. Habima has chosen to do the Israeli government&apos;s bidding by performing in these settlements. It should be told \u2013 and by the Globe Theatre \u2013 that actions have consequences.Jonathan RosenheadLondon \u2022 A simple look at any map reveals Ariel lies in the middle of the West Bank. However, the writers&apos; ignorance pales in comparison to their moral failure: namely their attempt to legitimise Israel&apos;s brutal colonisation project and hand Israel what is not theirs to hand.Ofer NeimanJerusalem \u2022 Ben White&apos;s pitiful argument (Letters, 23 April) that because Habima receives financial aid from the Israeli government it should be banned from performing is hypocritical and irrelevant. Should the RSC be banned from performing in the US because the Irish-American lobby objects? Or British cultural events abroad be boycotted because some people object to British troops protecting us in Afghanistan? All national arts institutions receive aid from their government. Will White be objecting to the Chinese, Iranian, Turkish and Zimbabwe performers, from nations with appalling human rights records? Or is it just Jews who bother him? Only philistines boycott visiting arts groups from democratic nations and it is clearly racist to ban Habima just because they are Israeli actors.Martin Sugarman Hackney-Haifa Friendship Association \u2022 My friend, the great actor Miriam Karlin, grew up in a strongly Zionist family, rejoicing at the establishment of the state of Israel. Later she became a fierce critic of Israel&apos;s behaviour towards the Palestinians. When, towards the end of her life, I asked what attention she had paid to the Palestinians at Israel&apos;s birth, she responded unhesitatingly: &quot;I am ashamed to say I never thought about them at all.&quot; The same phenomenon, but lacking the shame, is evident among supporters of the Globe&apos;s invitation to Israel&apos;s Habima Theatre, as they fling unevidenced accusations of anti-Semitism, delegitimising of Israel, exclusion of Jewish actors and worse at those who want Habima to be uninvited. Habima&apos;s critics \u2013 including many eminent Jewish theatre professionals \u2013 simply point to the company&apos;s enthusiastic agreement to perform in the illegal settlements, on Palestinian territory from which the Palestinians have been driven. Meanwhile, most Habima defenders don&apos;t acknowledge the Palestinians&apos; interest in this matter at all. Even those asserting opposition to the occupation (David Edgar, Howard Brenton), are silent about the elephant in the room \u2013 that Habima&apos;s settlement audiences are exclusively Jewish. No Palestinians can get within miles of a settlement theatre, much less buy tickets. The only anti-Semitism I perceive in this debate is among those refusing to hold Israel and its institutions to the same human rights, multicultural and anti-segregation standards we apply everywhere else in the world.

It&apos;s a notion conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim would resist. &quot;For many people, music is here to let them forget the daily chores of life,&quot; he says. &quot;People have a difficult day at the office, they have a fight with their wife or their mistress, or both, they get bad news from their accountant. So they come home, exhausted, put their feet up, and put on their favourite Chopin Nocturne \u2013 preferably played by me \u2013 and within three minutes they have forgotten their troubles. But I maintain music is not here to make us forget about life. It&apos;s also here to teach us about life: the fact that everything starts and ends, the fact that every sound is in danger of disappearing, the fact that everything is connected \u2013 the fact that we live and we die.&quot; He warms to his theme, fixing me with the intense, challenging stare that has galvanised orchestras the world over. I understand now why musicians from Chicago to Berlin give him performances of such fire and intensity. &quot;Once you start playing a piece, there is a connection between every note. You cannot say, &apos;I will not concentrate on this note.&apos; You cannot ignore things the way you do in the rest of your life. And being in an orchestra teaches you that you cannot be in the centre all the time, that sometimes you are not the soloist but have to become part of a bigger collective spirit.&quot; We meet the night after Barenboim conducts the final concert in a series of Bruckner symphonies in London with the Staatskapelle Berlin. Bruckner&apos;s Eighth was an especially thrilling, take-nothing-for-granted performance \u2013 though Barenboim tells me a couple of cellos didn&apos;t turn up in time for the start, because they forgot there was no Mozart piano concerto preceding the symphony that night. &quot;You obviously didn&apos;t notice the cellos were weak, which is good,&quot; he laughs. This year, Barenboim will perform one of the biggest projects of his musical life: playing the complete symphonies of Beethoven at the Proms with his West-Eastern Divan orchestra, an ensemble that puts young Palestinian and Israeli musicians side by side, along with players from the rest of the Arab world. The series will climax with a performance of the Ninth on the same day as the Olympics opening ceremony. The real challenge of these concerts, Barenboim says, will be the fact that he has programmed music by Pierre Boulez, the world&apos;s greatest living composer-conductor, alongside the Beethoven. &quot;I had three choices,&quot; he explains. &quot;I could either just play Beethoven and his contemporaries. That&apos;s not interesting to me \u2013 I wanted to make this music sound modern. So then I could try to find a different modern composer for each programme; or I could find a single composer whose music could stand the tension of being sandwiched between two symphonies of Beethoven, which is not easy. How many composers could stand up to that? I thought of Elliott Carter and I thought of Harrison Birtwistle. I love Carter&apos;s music. I think, since Haydn, there has not been a composer who is permanently in high spirits like Carter. And Birtwistle \u2013 well, I think his music is not in such high spirits, but it is wonderfully interesting. In the end, I chose Boulez because his music works in the opposite direction from Beethoven&apos;s. Those are my three favourite contemporary composers. You see, I don&apos;t go very far in the alphabet: Birtwistle, Boulez, Carter.&quot; Barenboim and Boulez go back a long way. It is nearly 50 years since they performed Bart\u00f3k&apos;s first piano concerto together in Berlin, a concert Barenboim has recalled as one of the most challenging of his life: &quot;I felt, for the 23 minutes it takes to play the concerto, that I was on the most slippery, uncontrollable ground, for what seemed to me like 24 hours, not a\u00a0few minutes.&quot; Barenboim was 22. Since then he has conducted Boulez&apos;s orchestral and ensemble works, commissioned Boulez&apos;s series of Notations; the pair have worked together frequently as soloist and conductor. &quot;He has an outstanding intelligence and an uncompromising nature which gives him tremendous moral strength.&quot; Does he hear these qualities in Boulez&apos;s music, too? &quot;Yes, oh yes. They are one unity. Boulez has a particular love of everything that is complex.&quot; Sometimes, the music is too complex even for Barenboim. In the first of the Beethoven Proms, audiences will hear the revolutionary amuse-bouche of Beethoven&apos;s First, with its still shocking opening chord, followed by 45 minutes of Boulez&apos;s explosive ensemble work, D\u00e9rive II. The latter is a teeming, kaleidoscopic piece, by turns seductive and violent, the most continually dynamic of any of Boulez&apos;s recent works. &quot;When I started studying D\u00e9rive,&quot; Barenboim says, &quot;I couldn&apos;t really read the first three pages of the score. I got a recording that Pierre had conducted. So I had the score on my lap and I put the CD on \u2013 and I still couldn&apos;t follow the damn thing. It was so complex and so fast. But then I grew to understand it and to love it. And it is a masterpiece of the first order.&quot; What does he think is the connection between Beethoven and Boulez? &quot;If you look at Beethoven&apos;s sketches, you see that he went from the most complex idea to the most simple. His sketches are much more complex than the final versions of the music. With Boulez, it is the other way round. He has a simple idea \u2013 a chord, a collection of notes \u2013 and gets a fantastic kick out of making it more interesting, more varied, more complex. The process is exactly the opposite, but like all true opposites, they are more similar than you think.&quot; Boulez is Beethoven viewed through the wrong end of a telescope, in other words, and vice-versa. The Beethoven/Boulez project is one realisation of Barenboim&apos;s current mission \u2013 to take music out of what he calls the &quot;ivory tower&quot; of isolation, whether that&apos;s political, cultural or personal. This is what his West-Eastern Divan Orchestra project has been about ever since he founded it with Edward Said in 1999. For all the excitement of this summer&apos;s Beethoven cycle, which will be performed in the space of a single week, Barenboim believes the West-Eastern&apos;s real potential will only be realised &quot;the day we can play in all the countries that are represented. The day I go on a tour and play Damascus, Amman, Tel Aviv and Cairo \u2013 then the full dimension of the Divan will come into play.&quot;They performed in Ramallah, Palestine, in 2005, &quot;and I don&apos;t think that would be possible today. The situation is so much worse.&quot; But he\u00a0remains an optimist, even if, as\u00a0he\u00a0has said, &quot;optimism is a form of self-defence&quot;. He lambasts the traditional training of musicians in conservatoires around the world, accusing them of isolating young performers from the realities of politics, ideas and history. How would he change this? &quot;I would like to be a terrorist for music education \u2013 to make a complete reform, all over the world. And now is the moment to do it. A moment of financial crisis is the perfect time, because we need to show that it would be much cheaper to educate the public than to cut subsidies for theatres and orchestras in Germany, Britain, France and Italy.&quot; That searching stare is back. &quot;At the moment,&quot; he adds, &quot;opera only appeals to a certain number of people. But if you had proper education, the same opera would appeal to 10 times that number. It would be proportionally cheaper. That&apos;s why I need to be the Che Guevara of music education.&quot; \u2022 Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Beethoven&apos;s complete symphonies, and works by Pierre Boulez at the BBC Proms, 20-27 July.

Last week, who said Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak \u2013 Israel&apos;s prime minister and defence minister \u2013 &quot;are misleading the public on the Iran issue&quot; and making decisions &quot;based on messianic feelings&quot;? Was it (a) Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; (b) the Stop the War Coalition president, Tony Benn; or (c) the former Israeli spymaster Yuval Diskin? It was (c). At a public meeting on Friday Diskin, former head of Shin Bet (Israel&apos;s MI5), described Netanyahu and Barak as &quot;not fit to hold the steering wheel of power&quot;. He went on: &quot;I have observed them from up close \u2026 They are not people who I, on a personal level, trust to lead Israel to an event on that scale and carry it off \u2026 They tell the public that if Israel acts, Iran won&apos;t have a nuclear bomb. This is misleading. Actually, many experts say that an Israeli attack would accelerate the Iranian nuclear race.&quot;     Illustration by Andrzej Krauze    Diskin joins a long list of eminent members of the Israeli security establishment who have publicly voiced criticism of, and opposition to, their government&apos;s ultra-hawkish line on Iran. In fact, his astonishing attack on his former bosses came just 48 hours after the head of Israel&apos;s military, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz, declared that the Iranian leadership had not yet made a decision to build nuclear weapons, that it was unlikely to go this &quot;extra mile&quot;, and was composed of &quot;very rational people&quot;. &quot;Decisions must be made carefully out of historic responsibility but without hysteria,&quot; added Gantz in a not-too-subtle dig at his political masters. Last month, in an unprecedented move, Meir Dagan, the former head of the Mossad \u2013 Israel&apos;s foreign intelligence service \u2013 took to the airwaves in the US, using an interview with CBS to tell his American audience how a war with Iran would be &quot;devastating&quot; for Israelis because it would &quot;ignite, at least from my point of view, a regional war&quot;. (He had earlier described an Israeli attack on Iran as &quot;the stupidest idea I&apos;ve ever heard&quot;.) Meanwhile, Dagan&apos;s predecessor, Efraim Halevy, has said &quot;it is not in the power of Iran to destroy the state of Israel&quot;, and that &quot;the growing Haredi radicalisation poses a bigger risk than Ahmadinejad&quot;. Then there is the current head of the Mossad, Tamir Pardo, who is said to have told an audience of Israeli diplomats in December that a nuclear-armed Iran would not constitute an &quot;existential threat&quot; to Israel. But this isn&apos;t just about spymasters or generals. There is no consensus favouring military action against Iran within Israel&apos;s political establishment either. Recent media reports have suggested Netanyahu and Barak are isolated within their own cabinet; Daniel Ben-Simon, a Labour party member of the Israeli parliament, has called them &quot;a two-man show&quot; \u2013 or, as a recent headline in the New York Times put it, &quot;Two Israeli leaders make the Iran issue their own&quot;. Shaul Mofaz, the opposition leader \u2013 of the Kadima party and a former head of the Israeli army \u2013 has objected to Netanyahu&apos;s obsession with attacking Iran. &quot;The greatest threat to the state of Israel is not nuclear Iran,&quot; Mofaz said in an interview earlier this month, citing the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians as a much more pressing issue. The Israeli president, Shimon Peres, told CNN in November that he preferred a &quot;moral&quot; attack on Iran, not a military one. Oh, and guess what? The Israeli public is far from gung-ho. According to a poll released last month by the Israeli Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University, 63% of Israelis oppose a unilateral Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. An earlier poll, for the University of Maryland in February, revealed only a fifth of Israelis favoured a strike on Iran without the support of the United States. There is an important lesson here for the west&apos;s hawks and doves alike. The hawks in the Commons and Congress who invoke Israel&apos;s national security as the chief justification for a pre-emptive attack on Iran are ignoring the expert opinions of Israel&apos;s own military and intelligence chiefs, both past and present. Meanwhile, the doves who take to the streets with anti-war placards that blame the Jewish state for exaggerating the threat from Iran should consider replacing the word &quot;Israel&quot; with &quot;Netanyahu&quot;. It is the cynical and belligerent &quot;Bibi&quot; who takes every opportunity to fear-monger about a Nazi-like threat from Iran. In a speech this month to mark the Holocaust, he proclaimed: &quot;People who refuse to see the Iranian threat have learned nothing from the Shoah [Holocaust].&quot; And last month in the US, he compared bombing Iran to bombing Auschwitz. But Netanyahu isn&apos;t Israel \u2013 a nation of 7.8 million people, including 1.6 million Arabs. Those of us opposed to another catastrophic conflict in the Middle East should not allow his alarmist and messianic rhetoric to drown out the voices of Israel&apos;s doves: those critics of military action, who, ironically, are far more numerous and outspoken than the doves on Capitol Hill or in Westminster, and have far better credentials. Just as it is wrong to reduce Iran to Ahmadinejad, or the US to George Bush, it is wrong, and counter-productive, to reduce Israel to Netanyahu. Its ordinary citizens don&apos;t want war with Iran, and the country&apos;s top spooks and soldiers are queueing up to tell us why. \u2022 Comments on this article may be switched off overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-04-29T17:35:00Z", "title": "Most Israeli citizens don't want a war with Iran | Mehdi Hasan", "sentences": ["According to a poll released last month by the Israeli Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University, 63% of Israelis oppose a unilateral Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/israel-citizens-dont-want-war-iran"}, {"tags": ["Classical music", "Jazz", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Israel&apos;s Ilan Volkov is one of the world&apos;s most adventurous conductors, a specialist in early-20th-century modernism who has made his name with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Iceland&apos;s Symphony Orchestra.

There are 1,500 former prisoners of war living there \u2013 an incredible number, given its population is around the same as London&apos;s. Meanwhile, Israel has released an estimated 10,000 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists in the past 25 years, usually in group deals to free its own captured troops. Statistics show that many released terror suspects soon reoffend, meaning Israeli PoWs become crippled by guilt. Soldiers released in prisoner exchanges report feeling blamed for every terrorist attack after the swap. When a bus gets blown up, they see accusing eyes on them, as if the bombers being freed to commit such atrocities is their fault. No surprise, then, that Prisoners of War (Hatufim) \u2013 the Israeli TV drama on which Channel 4&apos;s US hit Homeland is based \u2013 is even more emotionally charged and wrenchingly powerful than its US remix. Sure, Homeland taps into America&apos;s obsession with Osama Bin Laden and the &quot;war on terror&quot; but it soon spins off into more conventional thriller territory. Hatufim is grittier and less glossy, yet equally as gripping. &quot;Right from the start, Homeland fans will recognise some scenes as more or less identical,&quot; says Hatufim&apos;s creator, writer and director Gideon Raff. &quot;The airport homecoming is pretty much word for word; the wife seeing the husband&apos;s scars; the early plot device of the finger-tapping which could be a coded signal. The heart and the main themes are the same, but other things are very different.&quot; When Hatufim (Hebrew for &quot;kidnapped&quot;) aired on Israel&apos;s Channel 2 two years ago, it became the country&apos;s highest-rated drama of all time. &quot;That took me by surprise,&quot; says Raff. &quot;I never expected the biggest network to want it, let alone show it on Saturday nights. That was brave.&quot;     Gideon Raff    Before Raff had shot a frame, on the strength of the script alone his creation was bought by Hollywood. &quot;Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa were just coming off 24 and looking for their next project. They loved my pilot script, so we started meeting in Los Angeles to discuss turning it into an American show. A lot of the changes came down to differences between the two countries. In Israel, we negotiate with terrorists to get prisoners released. The US don&apos;t, so Brody had to be freed in a military operation. In Hatufim, I wanted to show broken soldiers, broken masculinity; whereas in Homeland, Brody comes back buffer, a poster boy.&quot; Raff stayed on board and is still a writer and exec producer on Homeland, flitting between the two countries and two shows. &quot;It gets confusing at times but they&apos;re very different beasts,&quot; chuckles Raff. &quot;The Homeland pilot alone cost more to make than both seasons of Hatufim. When I tell my American counterparts that my budget was $200,000 per episode, they burst out laughing. To us that&apos;s a big production, to them it&apos;s a guerrilla shoot. &quot; So how did Raff, who&apos;s still only 39, create not one but two critically adored, gong-garlanded shows? Israel-born, he came up with the idea while living in LA, where he attended the American Film Institute. &quot;I&apos;d been there nine years and felt like I was in exile,&quot; he says. &quot;Every time I came back to Israel, which was supposed to feel like home, it felt more different. Things changed, people had moved on. Somehow that got me thinking about prisoners of war coming back after an enforced absence.&quot; Once Raff embarked upon his extensive research \u2013 talking to dozens of former PoWs, their families, therapists and interrogators \u2013 he realised that homecoming signals the end of most PoW stories. He resolved to make his narrative start at a point where the rest finish. &quot;I discovered a whole world of untapped drama. Here in Israel, we want the boys back home, we demand it from our government, who often pay a steep price to get hostages back. But we need a happy ending. We don&apos;t want to deal with those days after release, their post-trauma or reintroduction to society. Yet coming home is only the start of their journey. For some, it&apos;s even harder than captivity.&quot; Hatufim tells the story of three Israeli reservists captured behind enemy lines in Lebanon. Seventeen years later, they&apos;re freed. Two come back alive, the third in a coffin. The 10-part series unfolds as a psychological puzzle, flashing back to their time in captivity as they try to rebuild their lives while dealing with their loyalties being questioned during in-depth debriefings. The torture scenes are more visceral than Homeland&apos;s, involving electrocution and firing squads. &quot;They&apos;re hard to watch for some people,&quot; says Raff, &quot;but I thought it was moot to talk about post-trauma without seeing the trauma. The real former PoWs were completely unaffected by the torture scenes. It was the stuff between husband and wife \u2013 in the bedroom, him hitting her in his sleep \u2013 that spoke to their experiences. Every weekend when the show finished, I&apos;d get very moving phone calls from PoWs I&apos;d interviewed. I&apos;m still in touch with many of them.&quot;     Prisoners Of War    Hatufim is more an ensemble piece than double-header Homeland, putting three families at the heart of the action. &quot;The PoWs went through something so horrible, you don&apos;t know who&apos;s coming back. Suddenly there&apos;s a stranger in the house. I put a big emphasis on their families, because they were prisoners too. All their lives stopped. They&apos;re stuck campaigning or waiting. The one wife in Hatufim who moved on [reported under the newspaper headline &quot;Cheating on an entire nation&quot;] sparked a huge discussion here: &apos;How long would you wait?&apos;&quot; This domestic drama, Raff believes, is the main difference between original and remake. &quot;Homeland is a straight thriller \u2013 is he a terrorist or not? What&apos;s relevant for an American audience is the enemy within, whether the war hero&apos;s been turned. Israeli audiences are more interested in the relationships, the emotional ride, the secrets and suspense.&quot; Israeli TV is enjoying a hot streak right now. Hebrew psychiatry drama BeTipul was remade as In Treatment by HBO, which is also adapting Israeli police procedural The Naked Truth. Julia Stiles will play the lead in Midnight Sun, NBC&apos;s remake of kibbutz-set conspiracy thriller Pillars of Smoke (Timrot Ashan). The rights to Yellow Peppers, a series about a farming family with an autistic son, have been snapped up by Mad Men&apos;s studio, Lionsgate. It&apos;s an unlikely purple patch for a modest TV industry that only got its first commercial channel in 1993. &quot;Israel&apos;s a small country but both the audience and programme-makers are very sophisticated,&quot; says Raff. &quot;We have to be creative on a tight budget, which encourages strong storytelling. We have an auteur-led approach; it&apos;s less of a machine, more about creators with vision.&quot; This thriving TV industry has become a great source of national pride. &quot;When Homeland got the Golden Globe, the headline on one of our newspapers was, &apos;We won!&apos; The whole country celebrated. Then Claire Danes said on Conan O&apos;Brien that Tel Aviv was a fun city and for a week everybody walked a little taller here.&quot; It&apos;s been quite a ride for Raff, too. &quot;I met Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes and he told me how much he loved Homeland, plus of course it&apos;s Obama&apos;s favourite show. It&apos;s been an amazing year.&quot; Raff has just shot the second series of Hatufim, which airs in Israel next month. &quot;People have been coming up to me in the street, saying they can&apos;t wait. And the Homeland crew is coming over here next week to start shooting the second season. We&apos;ve become one big happy family.

His comments follow media reports of rising crime, including two gang rapes, in southern Tel Aviv, where many African migrants are concentrated. However, Micky Rosenfeld, spokesman for the Israeli police, said the overall crime rate in Israel had fallen. There had been one alleged rape of a teenage girl connected to the migrant community, for which three suspects were in custody, he added. Yohanan Danino, the Israeli police chief, said migrants should be permitted to work to discourage petty crime. Nearly all are unable to work legally, and live in overcrowded and impoverished conditions. &quot;The community needs to be supported in order to prevent economic and social problems,&quot; said Rosenfeld. But the interior minister, Eli Yishai, rejected such a move, saying: &quot;Why should we provide them with jobs? I&apos;m sick of the bleeding hearts, including politicians. Jobs would settle them here, they&apos;ll make babies, and that offer will only result in hundreds of thousands more coming over here.&quot; Yishai repeated an earlier call for all migrants to be jailed pending deportation. &quot;I want everyone to be able to walk the streets without fear or trepidation ... The migrants are giving birth to hundreds of thousands, and the Zionist dream is dying,&quot; he told Army Radio. Last week he said most migrants were involved in criminal activity. According to police data quoted by the Hotline for Migrant Workers, the crime rate among foreigners in Israel was 2.04% in 2010, compared with 4.99% among Israelis. More than 13,500 people entered Israel illegally in 2010, of whom almost two-thirds were Eritrean and one-third were Sudanese. Three were granted refugee status by Israel, rising to six last year. Human rights organisations say more than 50,000 asylum seekers and migrants have entered Israel illegally since 2005. Most are smuggled across the Israel-Egypt border by Bedouin tribesmen. Israel is constructing a vast steel fence through 150 miles of the Sinai desert as a deterrent to people-trafficking and the smuggling of drugs and weapons. The barrier would be completed, bar one small section, by October, Netanyahu said. Israel is also constructing the world&apos;s largest detention centre for asylum seekers and illegal migrants, capable of holding 11,000 people. The \u00a358m building, close to the border, will receive its first detainees by the end of the year. Netanyahu said the state would embark on &quot;the physical withdrawal&quot; of migrants, despite fears among human rights organisations about the dangers they could face in their home countries. Yishai said: &quot;I&apos;m not responsible for what happens in Eritrea and Sudan, the UN is.&quot; As tensions rise in cities with relatively high African populations, the past month has seen a spate of attacks on buildings in south Tel Aviv that house asylum seekers and migrant workers.

It is a surprise they see anything at all. I try to ignore my invisible little friend, the smart-assed creep on my shoulder. But if that doesn&apos;t work, there&apos;s always exorcism. We were standing at a voodoo altar, curator Jean de Loisy, anthropologist Bertrand Hell and me. There were just a couple of pots on the floor, each containing a huge, multicoloured, waxy, fat-congealed mound of stuff. There might have been some chicken in there, and what looked like jawbones, of what I couldn&apos;t tell. It had been sitting under the gallery lights for a couple of weeks. Yum. &quot;What this thing needs to activate it is strong alcohol!&quot; De Loisy exclaimed, and picked up a bottle of gin from beside the pots, giving the mounds a liberal sprinkling then taking a swig himself. These are the sorts of spirits I like, but he didn&apos;t pass the bottle. For a moment, nothing discernible happened. No voodoo, no who-do. The sorcerer from Togo who concocted the altar goes by the name of Az\u00e9 Kokovivina, Sorcerer of the Giggles. Maybe that&apos;s where the gin comes in. Suddenly I wasn&apos;t laughing, but plunged into a world of spirits, demons and creatures from the netherworld. Annette Messager&apos;s clothes flew about the room, powered by electric fans. A tiny carved Peruvian shaman, part baby, part boxer, and no bigger than my hand, took up a fighting stance. A medieval St Michael slew a demon, Joseph Beuys gave a lecture to a dead hare and Picasso transformed himself into a faun. A figure with a head like a dunce&apos;s cap gave me the eye, and what looked like a sock turned into a cuttlefish. Ancient beings of remarkable ferocity stalked my way and Sri Lankan masks gurned and yowled.     Spirits and demons ... Motion/Emotion (2012), by Annette Messager, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    In the Garden of Addiction, Christophe Berdaguer and Marie P\u00e9jus&apos;s tangle of glass tubes, like so many evil flowers, proffered the scents of opium, cocaine, skunk and booze. Various modern-day witches and healers discussed their craft on a tower of TV screens. It was like watching a dozen cookery channels at once. Cultures, eons, continents flew by. We were among the forces of chaos and disorder: healers and tricksters, shape-shifters and spirit guides, transgressors and transvestites. Housed in a mock-up cave of aluminium struts, wallboard and plaster-soaked scrim, the exhibition Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos) is an exercise in wild curating at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris. De Loisy has always been a bit of a maverick curator. Here, he has brought together a bewildering selection of artefacts, sculptures, costumes, masks and objects from past and present, and from every continent. Beautiful, tender objects collide with the monstrous and the devilish. Much of it has extraordinary power and vitality. Among it all are a number of more modern, western artworks \u2013 from Picasso to Paul McCarthy \u2013 as if to show the persistence of the transgressive and the search for hidden meaning in the world. Beuys, a latter-day shaman, thought he could heal the postwar world with his art. Randy old goat Picasso was a shape-shifter and trickster. Other recent artists \u2013 Jonathan Meese, the Chapman Brothers, Russia&apos;s Oleg Kulik being led around on a chain and behaving like a mad dog \u2013 are just tricky. But if you want to be an artist, you&apos;ve got to believe in something. The trouble with most contemporary art in this context is that little of it, if any, is the product of a shared belief system that glues the world, and the self, together. If there are no rules, there&apos;s nothing to transgress. The exhibition&apos;s title is taken from Bertrand Hell&apos;s book Possession and Shamanism, yet to be translated into English. Masters of Chaos is also the culmination of De Loisy&apos;s own 20-year obsession with the subject. His previous curatorial projects have included exhibitions on beauty, on the face, and, in 2008, Traces of the Sacred, a tour of the persistence of the sacred in 20th- and 21st-century art. He also collaborated with Anish Kapoor and James Turrell and, after working at the Centre Pompidou, went sailing around the world for a number of years. He is a man in search of something. He has also recently been appointed director of the newly renovated Palais de Tokyo, just across the Seine, where the Paris Triennale is currently on view \u2013 the launch show in the expanded, renovated building.     Wild ... Jean-Michel Basquiat (1988) at Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos). Photograph: The estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat/ADAGP    The two exhibitions share an interest in the ethnographic, in cultural difference and transcultural proximity, but could not be more different in approach. De Loisy is passionate about objects. The Triennale, which goes by the title Intense Proximity, is much more cautious about the readings we might make of the vast corpus of paintings and sculpture, films and video installations, photographs and drawings brought together by guest curator Okwui Enwezor. De Loisy&apos;s show is a thematic romp. Enwezor&apos;s triennale admits to the difficulties of finding order and meaning in the world. The triennale is a trial for any spectator. I wandered like a lost tourist. One minute, you&apos;re in the Venezuelan jungle, the next at a mixed-race wedding in the new South Africa. One minute, I&apos;m staring at the most intimate body parts of an Amsterdam sex-worker, the next watching a TV documentary about a talent contest for migrant Filipinos in Tel Aviv. I twirl along to north African beats and stare at a group of closed and silent grand pianos. Here are Claude Levi-Strauss&apos;s notebook drawings and a great new painting by Chris Ofili; over there are some gorgeous black-and-white photographs of Bahia&apos;s Afro-Brazilian dock life in the 1940s. On a screen, blacked-up (now that really does seem transgressive), the young French artist Lili Reynaud-Dewar dances among a group of her own sculptures, in homage to Josephine Baker. The day before my shimmy with the shamans, I&apos;d spent almost five hours here and was still reeling. Enwezor, who directed Documenta 11 in 2002 and is now running the Haus der Kunst in Munich, has a very different take on art and ethnography to De Loisy. He sees a link between the ethnographer and the artist, ethnography and curating.     La Chor\u00e9graphie des Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (2011) and La Frise Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (1976-2012), by Sarkis, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    Intense Proximity focuses on this: the link between the close and the distant, the near and the far. It confronts us with the world&apos;s disjunctions. With so many cultural differences and competing interests in an ever-shrinking world, how do we even begin to make sense of it all? Is art a kind of news from elsewhere (whether a geographical place or a somewhere in the artist&apos;s mind), or a report from the close-to-home? Both exhibition catalogues quote the ironic opening phrase of Levi-Strauss&apos;s marvellous 1955 book Tristes Tropiques: &quot;I hate travelling and explorers&quot;. The idea of exploration has changed immeasurably since the days of 19th-century colonial empire, and as much again since Levi-Strauss&apos;s first trip to Brazil in 1935. Bertrand Hell told me how little travelling French ethnographers and anthropologists undertake nowadays. On the other hand, today&apos;s curators, and even critics, are always on the move. Enwezor admits to a kind of intellectual vertigo and spatial disorientation. Descending into the bowels of the Palais de Tokyo, I knew what he meant. It has hidden depths, basements leading to sub-basements, subterranean mezzanines and floors, traversed by ramps and open, curving staircases. Films are screened in rediscovered auditoria that had been walled up for decades, and in side rooms branching from dizzying Piranesian shafts. The place seems to go on for ever, and so does the triennale. When I described my journey through the triennale to De Loisy, he said he likes the idea of people getting lost in these basements. I like being lost, too. But this journey is accompanied by growing panic.     'How can anyone deal with all this stuff?' ... La Porte: Derri\u00e8re la Porte...! Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il y a Derri\u00e8re la Porte..?, by Georges Ad\u00e9agbo (2012), at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    I&apos;m bought up short by a sign that reads: &quot;I am not exotic I am exhausted.&quot; How can anyone deal with all this stuff? The urge to see everything leads to the frustration of not seeing anything, of always being driven on to the next thing without absorbing the last. It is a flight that becomes ever more urgent, ever more futile. If it is an encounter with anything, it is with competing urges: the voice on the shoulder jockeying me on, and a desire for it all to stop. It is an encounter with the chaos of the world. \u2022 Masters of Chaos is at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris, until 29 July \u2022 Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012 is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 26 August", "publicationDate": "2012-05-21T14:27:35Z", "title": "Adrian Searle encounters \u2026 chaos in Paris", "sentences": ["One minute, I&apos;m staring at the most intimate body parts of an Amsterdam sex-worker, the next watching a TV documentary about a talent contest for migrant Filipinos in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/21/adrian-searle-encounters-chaos-paris"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Mordechai Vanunu"], "article": "In December 1996 I found myself flying to Tel Aviv with Sir Roy Shaw and six other human rights campaigners to appeal to the president of Israel to release Mordechai Vanunu from imprisonment for revealing the existence of Israel&apos;s nuclear weapons.

Another screen will show the results of a tracking camera on a scaffolding tower, circling 360 degrees and filming the panorama of the Scottish borders, the line of Hadrian&apos;s Wall, Venus dipping into the Solway Firth, Helvellyn and the only three other mountains in England, as well as a closer (smaller) hill called  Tarnmonath and the North Pennines.     Keeping an eye on things. Douglas Gordon plots of the destruction of the piano. A second one goes up tonight. Photograph: Colin Davison     Douglas, probably best known for Zinedine Zidane: A 21st century Portrait, explained the symbolism of the piano burning: &quot;a piano started to represent for me the ultimate symbol of western civilisation. Not only is it an instrument, it&apos;s a beautiful object that works as a sculpture but it has another function entirely&quot;   &quot;I wanted to do something with a piano in a landscape of some significance and I suppose, as a Scotsman, there&apos;s nothing more significant than the border. When Jon Bewley of Locus+ led me to here, I thought it was beautiful to look from one country into another and I liked the idea Hadrian&apos;s Wall is, under a certain interpretation, a great end of civilisation. But of course technically with what we&apos;re doing with the 360 degree camera, there is no end or start of civilisation. You can imagine the Scots looking over the wall and thinking &quot;what the hell are those Romans up to now?&quot; - so it&apos;s a nice game to play over that border on what civilisation actually is. On my first visit I was overwhelmed to be in a landscape of such beauty and with such a huge unfathomable history.&quot;   Beth Bate, director of Great North Run Culture, said:   &quot; We&apos;re delighted to be working with Douglas Gordon and again with our partners Locus+. The End of Civilisation is a major new commission and we&apos;re especially grateful to Arts Council England for their support.&quot;   Like all films, this one brings a boost to the local economy, with many local people being involved, and pubs and accommodation providers benefitting. Harriet Dean, whose ancestors have owned the place since the 1150s, farms her sheep at Talkin Head, runs the holiday cottages where the film crew has been based and has been providing their catering. Initially somewhat sceptical about the project, she has been won over and says:  I&apos;ve been thrilled to welcome such an amazing group of talented people here. I&apos;m really looking forward to seeing the results and hope it will encourage more visitors to this wonderfully beautiful but empty corner of the country.       It's not over 'til the piano singes. Not long to go, though. Photograph: Colin Davison    &gt; Another piano burns tonight and tomorrow the film crew will pack up their huge quantity of equipment and the farm will revert to the tranquillity that it has enjoyed for the last 850 years \u2013 until the next Scottish invasion. The border theme will be continued when the film gets its premiere, on July 5th and 6th at the Tyne Theatre &amp; Opera House, built on the line of Hadrian&apos;s Wall in central Newcastle. You can book free tickets here. After the Newcastle premiere it tours to form part of a Douglas Gordon retrospective in Tel Aviv and will then be shown at film festivals and exhibitions in Venice, New York, Berlin and London.

Today I did the same in Tel Aviv.&quot; After five years on frontlines, Nic Schlagman is used to untrammelled hostility towards the African refugees and migrants with whom he works, but he says the situation has never been as critical as it is at present. On Tuesday afternoon, he walked the few metres from the office of his NGO in downtown Tel Aviv to observe the latest hundreds-strong anti-migrant rally, organised by National Union Knesset member Michael Ben-Ari and supported by a throng of hard-right activists including notorious settler leader Baruch Marzel. &quot;The climate of fear amongst the African community is at fever pitch,&quot; Schlagman said. &quot;Mothers pulled their kids off the streets in anticipation of the marchers arriving, and everyone&apos;s saying it&apos;s only a matter of time until someone gets killed.&quot; The spectre of such violence is hardly unfounded \u2013 a recent spate of arson attacks against a nursery and apartments housing refugees has revealed the level of hate coursing through the veins of Israelis furious at the influx of non-Jewish Africans into their country. By Wednesday night, &quot;race riots&quot; had engulfed the area, with dozens of migrants reported beaten and shops and homes attacked. Over recent days, reports of sexual assaults by African youths against Israeli girls has stoked the tension even higher, with interior minister Eli Yishai and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu going on record with hyper-incendiary statements against the African community. Asserting that the flow of African migrants and asylum seekers &quot;threatens Israel&apos;s social fabric and national security&quot;, Netanyahu promised to &quot;physically remove the infiltrators \u2026 crack down and mete out tougher punishments&quot;. Yishai pulled no punches either with his rabble-rousing rhetoric, branding the vast majority of African migrants as criminals and calling for members of the community to be arrested and deported &quot;without exception&quot;, accusing the migrants of killing the &quot;Zionist dream&quot;. Schlagman sees a clear link between such top-level incitement and the street-level vitriol being dished out verbally and physically to the vulnerable refugees of south Tel Aviv. &quot;Politicians say these things in the morning, and by the afternoon we get bomb threats made to our office.&quot; Tuesday&apos;s rally saw Marzel \u2013 never one to shy away from stirring up racial tension \u2013 lead his acolytes through the refugees&apos; neighbourhood, flying the flags of the banned extremist Kahane Chai group. &quot;Marzel [and Ben-Ari] are riding a wave of popular anger,&quot; Schlagman commented. &quot;They come to the area to stoke up anti-immigrant sentiment, using the classic narrative of the far right the world over.&quot; The police provided an armed escort for the marchers as they strode into the migrants&apos; midst, seemingly happy to let the demonstration take place under their noses. &quot;But when a refugee community library applied for a permit to hold a youth art event for this weekend, the police refused them a permit \u2013 saying they couldn&apos;t guarantee the safety of the children given the current climate,&quot; says Schlagman. Every year sees an upsurge in the number of refugees fleeing war-torn Africa to seek asylum in Israel, and the resentment felt by local Israelis increases in lockstep. The reaction of the Israeli public is hardly unique \u2013 witness the hostility of Italian, French and Dutch communities to similar situations \u2013 but that does not make it any easier to stomach, let alone justify, as some Israeli commentators are trying to do. Ever ready to scramble aboard a good hardline bandwagon, the Jerusalem Post ran an absurd article claiming &quot;the migrants have worn out their welcome&quot;, as though the Jewish state had originally bent over backwards to accommodate their arrival in previous years. When I first wrote about the situation four years ago, the Israeli foreign affairs department listed my Comment is free piece on their website as a way of twisting what I wrote to show how &quot;kind&quot; Israel was by comparison to other countries where Sudanese refugees were brutally persecuted. Even though the reality then was nothing like the pro-Israel propagandists claimed, the gloves are truly off now, with plans afoot to build &quot;prison&quot; cities to house all the non-Jewish Africans, and even tighter border fences being erected in the south of the country to keep out new groups seeking refuge in Israel. Israel, as a signatory to the Geneva conventions, is massively failing in its duties to these refugees, and its politicians are giving succour to the lowest common denominator in Israeli society by promoting such a harsh and uncaring response. Even sensible plans, such as calls by senior figures in the Israeli police to give migrants work permits to help lower the petty crime rate, are met with barrages of hate from Yishai: &quot;Why should we provide them with jobs? I&apos;m sick of the bleeding hearts \u2026 Jobs would settle them here, they&apos;ll make babies, and that offer will only result in hundreds of thousands more coming over here.&quot; Comments such as his and Netanyahu&apos;s inevitably fan the flames (both metaphorical and physical) that lead to such hostility towards those who deserve the utmost care and kindness in their hour of distress. Israeli opponents of such base racism must act now because, as the savage events of Wednesday night proved, the south Tel Aviv cauldron is starting to bubble over with devastating and disastrous effect. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-05-24T09:55:28Z", "title": "Israeli politicians are fanning the flames of anti-migrant tension | Seth Freedman", "sentences": ["Today I did the same in Tel Aviv.&quot; After five years on frontlines, Nic Schlagman is used to untrammelled hostility towards the African refugees and migrants with whom he works, but he says the situation has never been as critical as it is at present.", "On Tuesday afternoon, he walked the few metres from the office of his NGO in downtown Tel Aviv to observe the latest hundreds-strong anti-migrant rally, organised by National Union Knesset member Michael Ben-Ari and supported by a throng of hard-right activists including notorious settler leader Baruch Marzel.", "Schlagman sees a clear link between such top-level incitement and the street-level vitriol being dished out verbally and physically to the vulnerable refugees of south Tel Aviv.", "Israeli opponents of such base racism must act now because, as the savage events of Wednesday night proved, the south Tel Aviv cauldron is starting to bubble over with devastating and disastrous effect."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/24/israeli-politicians-anti-migrant"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Global development"], "article": "Demonstrators have attacked African migrants in Tel Aviv in a protest against refugees and asylum-seekers that indicates an increasingly volatile mood in Israel over what it terms as &quot;infiltrators&quot;.

A few perch on children&apos;s swings, some push battered bicycles. A whiff of stale urine hangs in the air. Beneath the restless boredom, there is a new mood: wariness. Since an anti-migrant demonstration last week turned ugly and violent, these men \u2013 many of whom fled in fear from their homes in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 are fearful once again. The display of naked racism in what is routinely described as a diverse and liberal city also shocked many Israelis. Around 1,000 people marched through an area of south Tel Aviv in which migrants are concentrated, chanting &quot;blacks out&quot; and holding signs calling for expulsion. Shops serving the migrant community were smashed up and looted; dark-skinned men were threatened. A member of the Israeli parliament told the crowd: &quot;The Sudanese are a cancer in our body.&quot; The protest followed a spate of reports in the Israeli media of a &quot;crime wave&quot; \u2013 including alleged rapes, assaults and robberies \u2013 blamed on migrants. Just a few days earlier the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, had warned that a flood of &quot;illegal infiltrators&quot; was threatening Israel&apos;s identity. In recent weeks, Molotov cocktails have been thrown at apartments housing African migrants. One firebomb was hurled into the yard of a kindergarten. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before,&quot; says Oscar Olivier, 45, who fled from Kinshasa 18 years ago. &quot;It was a surprise, but in some ways it was also foreseeable. Some politicians have been orchestrating this, inciting violence and hatred, for months.&quot; He was now very frightened, not just for himself but also his nine-year-old daughter, who was born in Israel but has no legal rights. A straw poll in and around Levinsky park finds men from Sudan, Eritrea, Congo, Nigeria and Somalia, most of whom describe escaping &quot;bad places&quot; in search of a better, safer life. Generally they pay Bedouin tribesmen to smuggle them across the Israel-Egypt border. Some bring their families, but male migrants easily outnumber women. According to Israel&apos;s population and immigration authority, 62,000 people have crossed the southern border since 2006. &quot;If we do not stop the entry, the problem\u00a0\u2026 could easily grow to 600,000 illegal infiltrators,&quot; Netanyahu said last week. Israel is constructing a vast steel fence along the border to deter people-smuggling, due to be completed by the end of this year, but some analysts suggest the route will simply transfer to the border with Jordan, which is still open. Once on Israeli territory, migrants are detained while their identity and country of origin is checked. Most are then given &quot;conditional release&quot; and put on buses to Tel Aviv, where they are dropped in Levinsky park and left to fend for themselves, or other Israeli towns and cities. Their temporary permits to stay in Israel need to be renewed every three or four months, and specifically exclude permission to work. Many end up being employed on a casual basis for a pittance, living in overcrowded rundown apartments, confined to the fringes of society. Some turn to crime out of desperation. &quot;Yes, a few people have committed crimes, but not because they are foreigners but because they are hungry and not allowed to work,&quot; says Olivier. &quot;You don&apos;t blame the whole community because of a few crimes.&quot; But the arrest of three Eritreans in connection with the alleged rape of a Jewish teenager fuelled a backlash among Israelis living in or close to areas with a high migrant population. The police chief Yohanan Danino called for migrants to be allowed to work to discourage petty crime caused by economic hardship. The interior minister, Eli Yishai, responded in uncompromising tone: &quot;Why should we provide them with jobs?\u00a0\u2026 Jobs would settle them here, they will make babies, and that offer will only result in hundreds of thousands more coming over here.&quot; Instead, he said, all migrants should be jailed pending deportation. The Israeli state is anxious to avoid creating a sense of permanence among migrants. Last week, the US state department noted in a global report on human rights that in 2011, Israel had approved just one asylum application out of 4,603 made during the course of the year. And in the coming week, the state is seeking court approval to deport at least 700 migrants to south Sudan, despite concern about their safety. The question of how to respond to the influx of Africans has caused some anguish in a state founded by refugees and immigrants. But it has been swiftly drowned out by much louder voices denouncing bleeding heart liberalism among those who live in middle-class areas, far from migrant communities. Many in Levinsky park simply feel they have swapped one kind of oppression for another. &quot;They don&apos;t like black people in Israel,&quot; said Aldheer Ahmed, 45, from Darfur. Nasser Omeh, 24, also from Darfur, says reaching Israel was a positive moment in a bleak life. &quot;But now they just want us to go away.&quot; After leaving Congo, Olivier went first to Egypt, where he realised he had &quot;left one dictatorship for another&quot;. He decided to head for Israel, &quot;the only democracy in the region&quot;. &quot;I expected to be welcomed by people who understand what it is to be a fugitive. Now each day I am waiting for the violence and hatred to flare up again,&quot; he said. Immigration to Israel \u2022 62,000 people have illegally crossed into Israel from Egypt since 2006, according to the population and immigration ministry. \u2022 The vast majority originate from Eritrea (two-thirds) and Sudan (one-third). \u2022 Most pay Bedouin smugglers $1,000-$2,500 to guide them across the border. \u2022 Israel is constructing a 150-mile steel fence along the border to deter what it calls &quot;infiltration&quot;. \u2022 It is also building the world&apos;s largest detention centre, capable of holding 11,000 people. \u2022 Israel granted asylum status to one out of 4,603 applicants last year, according to the US state department. \u2022 Israel&apos;s population is 7.8 million.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T09:38:08Z", "title": "Levinsky park migrants live in fear after Tel Aviv race riots", "sentences": ["Under the flowering jacaranda trees in Tel Aviv&apos;s Levinsky park, clusters of men lounge on the grass smoking cigarettes, making desultory conversation or dozing.", "Around 1,000 people marched through an area of south Tel Aviv in which migrants are concentrated, chanting &quot;blacks out&quot; and holding signs calling for expulsion.", "Most are then given &quot;conditional release&quot; and put on buses to Tel Aviv, where they are dropped in Levinsky park and left to fend for themselves, or other Israeli towns and cities."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/levinsky-park-migrants-tel-aviv"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "War crimes", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "In his account of his time covering the war in Vietnam for Esquire, Dispatches author Michael Herr explains how he once asked a US helicopter door-gunner how he could shoot women and children. The man answered: &quot;It&apos;s easy. You just don&apos;t lead them so much.&quot; It was a flippant and chilling answer to a question that occurs in every conflict \u2013 how, and why, do fighters commit those atrocities? In the aftermath of the massacre in the Syrian village of Taldou, near Houla, in Syria \u2013 where it seems in all likelihood that Shia Alawite shabiha gunmen loyal to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad murdered scores of Sunni civilians \u2013 it is a question that is inevitably being asked again. Having covered more than a dozen wars in which I have tried to understand the mechanisms of violence, I have come to realise a terrible reality: Herr&apos;s door-gunner, in his callous reply, was right. Because we are so shocked when confronted by atrocity and war crimes, especially involving women and children, we tend to invest them with a sense of moral \u2013 or immoral \u2013 drama and purpose often absent from the act. That is not to say that we should not find these killings abhorrent, or demand that those responsible be brought to justice. But in these circumstances people kill because they can; because they believe they can act with impunity; because they have been asked to and rationalised the utility of the act; and because they have persuaded themselves that their victims&apos; humanity is of lesser value than their own. What I am talking about is something more commonplace than Hannah Arendt&apos;s notion of the &quot;banality of evil&quot;; something summed up for me in a remarkable picture taken by my friend Ron Haviv when he photographed the Serb militia of &quot;Arkan&quot; Ra\u017enatovic and his men-murdering civilians. In that picture, one of Arkan&apos;s &quot;Tigers&quot; is seen &quot;dead checking&quot; a Bosnian Muslim woman they have shot by kicking her, a cigarette held insouciantly aloft. Not banal, but casual. That is the real question: how is it that killing civilians can come to be normal for those who are doing it. In Rwanda during the Hutu interahamwe killing, as Philip Gourevitch, author of We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families, documented, gangs had been primed by hate radio with the notion that their victims were &quot;cockroaches&quot;. It is a mistake, however, to believe that people can be persuaded to commit crimes against humanity by a short-term exposure to the rhetoric of hate. In massacres with a sectarian component, \u2013 which appear, at first sight at least, to have been a component in what occurred in Taldou, regardless of what orders were given by officials of the regime \u2013 the process of dehumanisation is likely to have been the slow work of a lifetime. Paul Connolly, a Northern Irish academic, established in a piece of seminal research on sectarian attitudes conducted at the end of the Troubles that such a process begins very young indeed, formed by family, community and culture. He discovered that by the age of three, children from Catholic communities were already twice as likely to be hostile to a police force regarded as pro-British as Protestant children; by six, a third of children strongly identified with their community, while a significant minority were already making sectarian statements. Similar research, conducted by Daniel Bar-Tal at Tel Aviv University, asked Israeli children to explain what &quot;Arab&quot; meant to them, identifying similar negative connotations becoming established in early years by the same social mechanisms. In peacetime, these tensions between groups are manageable, to a degree. But when conflict comes, it imposes its own explicit values \u2013 a &quot;conflict culture&quot; that values in-group cohesion and out-group hostility, which not only plays on these existing tensions, (from negative stereotyping to the dehumanisation of the other), but actually ascribes to them a positive value. In these kind of conflicts, those who display the fiercest loyalty to their own group and fiercest hatred of the &quot;other&quot; have a special usefulness \u2013 providing not only the most ruthless killers because they are challenged the least by the morality of what they are doing, but often also acting as examples of what the new culture of conflict &quot;requires&quot; of all members of the group. For in the end, this is what war does \u2013 and not only in authoritarian regimes like that of Assad. The same processes occur whenever men are asked to kill others. It is why each generation throws up its horrors, and why we should not be surprised even as we are horrified by each new My Lai, each new Sabra and Shatila, or each new Srebrenica.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T16:30:01Z", "title": "The Houla massacre shows how killing can become normal | Peter Beaumont", "sentences": ["Similar research, conducted by Daniel Bar-Tal at Tel Aviv University, asked Israeli children to explain what &quot;Arab&quot; meant to them, identifying similar negative connotations becoming established in early years by the same social mechanisms."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/29/houla-massacre-killing-normal"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Race issues", "Migration and development", "Global development"], "article": "Israel&apos;s interior minister has risked further inflaming public sentiment against African migrants by saying that the area of Tel Aviv in which they are concentrated has become &quot;the country&apos;s garbage can&quot; and suggesting many of them are infected with HIV. Eli Yishai, who said he was speaking out of &quot;love for my country&quot;, repeated earlier calls for all migrants to be imprisoned &quot;without exception&quot;. His comments, in an interview with Israel&apos;s Maariv newspaper to be published on Friday, followed a demonstration in Tel Aviv last week in which migrants were attacked and abused. Eleven youths appeared in courton Thursday accused of racially motivated attacks. &quot;Southern Tel Aviv has become the country&apos;s garbage can,&quot; Yishai said. &quot;I&apos;d suggest to all those bleeding hearts who speak out against me to take a few dozen infiltrators and house them in their neighbourhoods. Let them see them every day; let their children try to play in the playgrounds they&apos;re in. &quot;Yesterday, a woman called me. Two Sudanese men chased her in the alleyways of Jerusalem. It could have ended in rape. Did you know that there are a lot of women in Tel Aviv who have been raped but are afraid to complain so that they don&apos;t get stigmatised as Aids carriers?&quot; According to a health ministry spokesman quoted by Maariv, &quot;99.9% of the migrants who come to work in Israel are not infected with any unique disease whatsoever&quot;. Yishai said that &quot;infiltrators&quot;, along with Palestinians, were threatening the &quot;Zionist dream&quot;. &quot;There isn&apos;t another country that is as sensitive as we are to human rights,&quot; he said. He called for more detention centres and camps in which to hold migrants. &quot;We need to transform military bases in which we can imprison all of them without exception.&quot; Non-dangerous prisoners could be released early pending deportation to make room for &quot;infiltrators who pose a far greater risk to public safety&quot;. He said the army would be deployed to track down the migrants. &quot;The infiltrators are going to reach the promised land but they aren&apos;t going to see it at all, only through bars ... they are going to be deported from here, either pleasantly or forcibly,&quot; he said. He dismissed accusations of racism. &quot;I sound like a racist, a benighted man or a xenophobe, but I&apos;m motivated by love for my country and the knowledge that I don&apos;t have another country.&quot; A second member of the government, deputy health minister Yakov Litzman, said Israel was spending more than 50m shekels ($13m) a year on health care for African migrants &quot;at the expense of the weak population&quot;. &quot;This must be stopped ... there is no reason for Israelis to pay such a dear price,&quot; he said. Official data presented to a parliamentary committee this week showed the crime rate among foreigners was significantly lower than among Israelis. In southern Tel Aviv, which has become a flashpoint for racial tensions, the percentage of crimes committed by foreigners was 13.5% although they make up 28.5% of the population.

The decision by the Football Association and England&apos;s sponsor Vauxhall to provide &quot;England only&quot; areas in Kiev and Donetsk in Ukraine, where England will play their Group D matches, has been welcomed by anti-fascist groups which have voiced particular fears for the safety of black and Asian England fans. The Observer has learned that facilities are being hired in both cities so that the estimated 3,000 England fans can congregate safely and get advice from both FA officials and British police travelling to the championship. Only registered England fans will be admitted to the areas, meaning there will be no access for fans from the host nations. While an FA spokesman said the facilities were there to assist fans during their stay, sources said the decision reflected anxiety among British police that England fans could run into trouble if they were left to roam the cities on their own. Concern has grown after a BBC Panorama programme, broadcast on Monday, showed shocking footage of racist and antisemitic incidents at recent Polish and Ukrainian football grounds. In Ukraine, in particular, the police and stadium officials seemed reluctant to intervene. It is understood that the &quot;safe zones&quot; for England fans will be sited in social clubs with bars where supporters can drink alcohol \u2013 consumption of which is banned in public places in Ukraine \u2013 use the internet and mix with British police and FA officials who will be on hand to give advice. Nick Lowles, a leading anti-fascist campaigner and author of a report into racism and antisemitism in the two countries, welcomed the move as a sign of co-operation between English fans, police and the FA. But he remained concerned about England fans, particularly those visiting Ukraine. &quot;There will be far fewer travelling supporters in Ukraine, meaning it is going to be easier for locals to get tickets. The presence of England will attract local hooligan groups. &quot;My main concern, however, is away from the stadiums, away from the mass ranks of the police and cameras, for small groups of England fans, particularly black and Asian fans,&quot; said Lowles, who heads the Hope not Hate campaign. The England team will travel to Poland on Wednesday \u2013 and then on Friday visit the former Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp. The families of two black players, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, have said they are unlikely to travel to the championships because of fears of racial abuse. Lowles&apos;s report says there will be 31 anti-racist monitors at the tournament with two present at every game. Thousands of stewards have also been specially trained by the Poland-based anti-fascist organisation Never Again, to deal with racism. But the report says racism is commonplace. At a Europa League game in September, fans of Legia Warsaw, arguably the most racist and antisemitic of any in Poland, displayed a jihad banner behind the goal in an anti-Jewish demonstration against their Israeli opponents Hapoel Tel Aviv. A couple of weeks later the same fans chanted &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews off to the gas&quot; to fans from Lodz, a city whose population was a third Jewish before the second world war. Lowles says it is not just the supporters who are prone to nationalism. Jan Tomaszewski, a former Polish goalkeeper, said last August he was ashamed of the current Polish team which was made up of players who were not &quot;true Poles&quot;. Tomaszewski, now an MP for the rightwing Law and Justice party, said: &quot;This hotchpotch lacks only a cannibal from Africa, who once ate a Polish missionary. This is not a Polish team. There are Colombian and German stray dogs.&quot; Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, said: &quot;An enormous amount of preparation has been done by both the FA and the police. The advice to fans remains to take care, read the advice on the Foreign Office website and stick to it. Thereafter we would encourage people to travel and support the England team.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-06-02T22:31:36Z", "title": "Euro 2012: 'England only' zones set up amid fears for black and Asian fans", "sentences": ["At a Europa League game in September, fans of Legia Warsaw, arguably the most racist and antisemitic of any in Poland, displayed a jihad banner behind the goal in an anti-Jewish demonstration against their Israeli opponents Hapoel Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/02/euro-2012-england-zones-fans"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Race issues", "Africa"], "article": "An apartment housing 10 Eritreans has been firebombed in Jerusalem, against the backdrop of rising anti-migrant sentiment in Israel.

The police [are] treating this all due seriousness and will employ all means at its disposal to apprehend those responsible,&quot; said a police statement. The attack in the early hours of Monday morning follows a series of firebombings in southern Tel Aviv \u2013 an area in which African migrants are concentrated \u2013 including apartments and a kindergarten. Shops run by or serving migrants were smashed up and looted in a violent demonstration last month, in which Africans were attacked. Politicians, including the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the interior minister, Eli Yishai, have inflamed the volatile mood by suggesting Israel is being flooded with &quot;illegal infiltrators&quot;, that migrants are responsible for a crime wave and calling for all migrants to be locked up or deported. On Sunday, a law came into effect allowing the Israeli authorities to jail migrants for up to three years. Netanyahu also ordered ministers to accelerate efforts to deport 25,000 migrants from countries with which Israel has diplomatic relations, principally South Sudan, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Ethiopia. He conceded it was not possible to deport around 35,000 migrants from Eritrea, Sudan and Somalia. Eritreans and Sudanese make up more than 90% of those illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border in recent months. Israel is building a 150-mile (240km) steel fence along the border, which may have the short-term effect of increasing the numbers attempting to cross into Israel before it is completed later this year. During a tour of the fence on Sunday, a member of the Israeli parliament said that troops should fire on anyone attempting to cross the border illegally. &quot;Anyone that penetrates Israel&apos;s border should be shot, a Swedish tourist, Sudanese from Eritrea, Eritreans from Sudan, Asians from Sinai.

A man sweeping the floor with a toddler clinging to his legs said one word: &quot;No.&quot; Another, bringing bags of food from the nearby market, brushed past without making eye contact. As for the 10 Eritreans who had been trapped in a ground-floor apartment when the blaze began at 3am, they had gone. Four were in hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation; the rest had\u00a0fled. The overnight firebombing of a downtown Jerusalem building which houses refugees from sub-Saharan Africa was the latest in a string of attacks set against the backdrop of rising anti-migrant sentiment in Israel, fuelled by inflammatory comments by prominent politicians. Often described as infiltrators by ministers, the media, the army and government officials, migrants have also had labels such as &quot;cancer&quot;, &quot;garbage&quot;, &quot;plague&quot; and &quot;rapists&quot; applied to them by Israeli\u00a0politicians. The arsonists who struck the Jerusalem apartment, located in a religious neighbourhood of the city, scrawled &quot;get out of our neighbourhood&quot; on its outside wall. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said: &quot;This was a targeted attack which we believe was racially motivated.&quot; The foreign ministry condemned the &quot;heinous\u00a0crime&quot;. But on the street outside the building, the official response had little resonance with a man who arrived in Israel from Eritrea 14 years ago but was too scared to give his name. &quot;People look at you, they curse you. They say, &apos;Go back to your country.&apos; We are very afraid,&quot; he said. Tensions were inevitable, according to Moshe Cohen, the owner of a nearby jeweller&apos;s shop. &quot;They drink, they fight among themselves, they play African music on shabbat [the Jewish sabbath] when people want to pray.

Shops run by or serving migrants were smashed up and looted in a violent demonstration last month in which Africans were attacked. Many Israelis were shocked at the display of aggressive racism in their most liberal city. Political leaders did not allow the violence to temper their verbal onslaught against the migrants. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Israel&apos;s national identity was at risk from the flood of &quot;illegal infiltrators&quot;. Interior minister Eli Yishai suggested that Aids-infected migrants were raping Israeli women, and all, &quot;without exception&quot;, should be locked up pending deportation.

According to the immigration authority, there are 62,000 migrants in Israel, where the population is 7.8m. Over 2,000 migrants entered Israel via Egypt last month, compared with 637 last May. The construction of the 150-mile (240km) southern border fence, due to be completed later this year, is thought to be increasing in the short term the numbers attempting to cross into Israel . Nearly all are given temporary permits to stay in Israel which must be renewed every three or four months and specifically exclude permission to work. Many end up being employed on a casual basis for a pittance, living in overcrowded, rundown apartments and confined to the fringes of society. In desperation, some turn to petty crime. On Sunday, a law came into effect allowing the Israeli authorities to jail migrants for up to three years. People helping or sheltering migrants could face prison sentences of between five and 15 years.

It was being stoked by politicians and rightwing organisations, she added. &quot;We now see hotspots of tension between refugees and local people in many towns.&quot; Her organisation had also been targeted. &quot;We&apos;ve had phone calls, people cursing and saying ugly things, like, &apos;We hope you will be raped and we are coming to burn you.&apos; The politicians must take responsibility.

But the first performance of works by Richard Wagner, Hitler&apos;s favourite composer, by an Israeli symphony orchestra in the Jewish state was never likely to be a harmonious event. And now it has been thwarted. Tel Aviv University, the venue for a symposium on the German composer on 18 June culminating in a musical performance, has cancelled the booking made by the Israel Wagner Society following a wave of protests. The university claimed it had been misled by the organisers. &quot;We recently found out, to our astonishment, that the event is actually a concert during which the works of German composer Richard Wagner are to be performed,&quot; it said in a letter released to the media. &quot;You deliberately concealed this important detail from us, as well as the topic of the event and the exact name of the organisation behind it.&quot; Public objections had contributed to the decision, the university added. &quot;We have received complaints and angry protests calling for the cancellation of this controversial event, which crosses a red line and would deeply offend the Israeli public in general, and Holocaust survivors in particular. As you know, this is a highly sensitive public issue, particularly in Israel, where there are so many Holocaust survivors.&quot; Jonathan Livny, the founder of the Israel Wagner Society, gave his response to the Guardian: &quot;Total disgust.&quot; He said he had made the programme and the identity of its organisers clear in email correspondence with the university. &quot;The excuse that they didn&apos;t know is totally ludicrous and an outright lie,&quot; he said. &quot;But that&apos;s a technicality. The issue is that here is an academic institution that is threatened daily with boycotts because of Israel&apos;s policy in the occupied territories doing exactly the same thing: imposing a boycott.&quot; Israel, he said, had complained about calls in the UK for a boycott of the Israeli Habima theatre company&apos;s recent production of Shakespeare&apos;s The Merchant of Venice at London&apos;s Globe Theatre. &quot;Isn&apos;t that the same as boycotting this music?&quot; Among those lodging complaints was the Holocaust Survivors&apos; Centre, which said it was intolerable for music heard in Nazi concentration camps to be played in concert in the Jewish state. &quot;This is emotional torture for Holocaust survivors and the wider public in the state of Israel,&quot; said a letter from Uri Chanoch, the centre&apos;s deputy chairman, to the president of Tel Aviv university. &quot;Wagner provided inspiration for the Nazis, and there is a direct link between him and the Holocaust,&quot; Chanoch told Haaretz. &quot;I am 85 and at an age such as this, the memory of the distant past is even brighter than the memory of things which happened yesterday.&quot; Although Wagner died decades before Hitler&apos;s rise to power, his music is closely identified with the Nazis. The composer was an ultra-nationalist and a renowned antisemite, writing of &quot;the harmful influence of Jewry&quot;. An unofficial Wagner ban was introduced in 1938 by the predecessor of the Israel Philharmonic following the Kristallnacht pogrom. Previous attempts to perform Wagner in Israel have been met with protests and walkouts. In 2001, the celebrated Jewish conductor Daniel Barenboim led a performance of Wagner in an encore at the Israel Festival after warning the audience of what was to come and inviting those who objected to leave. Some walked out in protest, some gave a standing ovation. Last summer, the Israeli Chamber Orchestra performed Wagner&apos;s Siegfried Idyll at the Bayreuth festival in Germany. Conductor Roberto Paternostro, who lost many members of his family in the Holocaust, said his aim was &quot;to divide the man from his art.&quot; Livny, 65, also drew a distinction between the individual and his music. &quot;I have no regard for the composer \u2013 he was the worst kind of antisemite and I despise him. But God gave him a wonderful gift with which he wrote this beautiful, sublime music.&quot; Livny&apos;s father escaped Nazi Germany in 1938, carrying with him to Israel his Wagner records and passing on to his son a love of the music. The society, which according to Livny has many Holocaust survivors among its members, wanted to reclaim the composer. &quot;The only remaining symbol of the Nazis is Wagner, and I want to take that away,&quot; he said. It was hypocritical of Israelis to boycott Wagner but ride on German-built trains and drive German-made cars, and for the state to buy German submarines, he said. &quot;Wagner is the last taboo.&quot; Around 100 musicians had been hired on individual contracts specifying the performance of Wagner, which was to have been conducted by Asher Fisch. People had bought tickets &quot;with the express intention of listening to this music&quot;. The society was now facing a substantial loss. &quot;I will sue the university, but the real issue here is not financial,&quot; Livny said.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T15:27:32Z", "title": "Tel Aviv Wagner concert cancelled after wave of protest", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv University, the venue for a symposium on the German composer on 18 June culminating in a musical performance, has cancelled the booking made by the Israel Wagner Society following a wave of protests.", "&quot;This is emotional torture for Holocaust survivors and the wider public in the state of Israel,&quot; said a letter from Uri Chanoch, the centre&apos;s deputy chairman, to the president of Tel Aviv university."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/05/tel-aviv-wagner-concert-cancelled"}, {"tags": ["France", "Europe", "World news", "Marine Le Pen", "The far right", "Madonna", "Music"], "article": "France&apos;s far right leader Marine Le Pen will consider suing Madonna if she uses a video depicting the Front National president with a swastika on her face during performances in France. The image was shown on a huge screen at a concert the US singer gave in Israel, while she performed the song Nobody Knows Me. In the video, the faces of several world personalities appeared including Pope Benedict, the Chinese leader Hu Jintao and the US politician Sarah Palin. Themontage then briefly showed Le Pen&apos;s eyes and forehead with a swastika superimposed on her face, before her portrait appeared followed by an image resembling Adolf Hitler. The provocative stunt at the Tel Aviv concert brought furious reactions in France. Le Pen warned: &quot;If she does that in France, we&apos;ll be waiting for her.&quot; A party official told the newspaper 20 Minutes the Front National&apos;s lawyer was looking at possible legal action.

Critics of the the Front National, however, pointed out that in January a leading member of the party produced a caricature of former president Nicolas Sarkozy wearing a Nazi uniform. Le Pen, who came third with just under 18% of the vote in the first round of the presidential election in April, has been attempting to distance her party from supporters who hold Nazi sympathies, inherited from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen. In Le Parisien newspaper, she hit back at Madonna, who has adopted two children from Malawi. &quot;By the way, has Madonna given back the children she stole from Africa?

The image appeared briefly at one of the material girl&apos;s concerts in Tel Aviv, and caused a worldwide stir. Reactions ranged from high-fiving cheers of support to Ms Le Pen threatening to sue &quot;if she tries that in France&quot; (note how even legal threats are imbued with aggressive nationalism when they are made by the doyenne of the Gallic far right). Forgetting the efforts Le Pen has made to reform the image of her party since inheriting it from her father last year, the fact is that it remains a vehicle for Jean-Marie Le Pen&apos;s racism and antisemitism. The old bigot is given pride of place at almost every rally, with Marine gently pawing his meaty frame with as much enthusiasm as she panders to his enormous ego. If he wasn&apos;t turning 84 later this month, there is no doubt it would have been him rather than Marine who stood as FN candidate for the presidency this year. The really disturbing part of all this is that Le Pen senior was the runner-up in the presidential election of 2002, while his fawning daughter won around a fifth of the popular vote in 2012. Now she is set to capitalise on the FN&apos;s electoral resurgence to try to win them seats in parliament for the first time in two decades, consolidating a respectability that I suggest would be unobtainable in a country such as Britain. Can you imagine the kind of reception a candidate would receive in London if she took to the hustings with a family mentor who has been regularly convicted of Holocaust denial and stirring up hatred against Muslims? Yet I have attended Le Pen meetings all over France, including major cities such as Paris and Marseilles, and have yet to meet a single protester. There remains a bland amorality in French voters that evokes disturbing memories of the Vichy regime during the second world war. Then, a collaborationist government was allowed to assist in the persecution, and indeed murder of minorities, especially the Jews, effectively because millions did nothing about it. I think about this every time I see the Le Pens and their heavies marching unopposed through the streets, or being interviewed by nonplussed TV journalists who think questions about austerity and the eurozone are more important than ones about segregation and forced deportation. It often takes an extremist to highlight the dangers of one, and thus Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the eccentric leader of France&apos;s communist-backed Left party, will stand against Marine Le Pen in two-round elections for the National Assembly that take place on 10 and 17 June. M\u00e9lenchon says he has become a candidate in Le Pen&apos;s fiefdom of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a depressed northern mining town, to &quot;shine a light on the vampires&quot; of the FN. Such language is, of course, pure Madonna \u2013 childishly colourful, catchy, memorable and potentially offensive in equal measure. It neatly sums up people&apos;s fears as the FN bids to capture 15 constituencies across France, and so confirm itself as the popular rightwing choice of the unthinking working man and woman. Such a prospect is not a complicated one, and Madonna was entirely right to use her stage show in Israel to hint at the ideological horror it represents. The FN is a regressive, divisive party that offers nothing to a modern, forward-thinking republic except for historically discredited dogma. An international popstar with the ability to entertain and shock across borders was exactly the right person to instigate global debate on Le Pen and what she represents. Whether Madonna will do the same when she performs in Paris and Nice later this summer only she knows, but plenty of decent people around the world, including many in France, hope that she will. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "publicationDate": "2012-06-06T09:36:34Z", "title": "Madonna was right to highlight the horror of Marine Le Pen | Nabila Ramdani", "sentences": ["The image appeared briefly at one of the material girl&apos;s concerts in Tel Aviv, and caused a worldwide stir."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/madonna-highlight-horror-le-pen"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Last month, demonstrations against African refugees in Tel Aviv turned violent. Protesters looted shops, broke windows and firebombed buildings, including a nursery. Days ago, arsonists torched the home of 10 African migrants in Jerusalem, injuring four, and leaving the unequivocal graffiti: &quot;Get out of the neighbourhood.&quot; On Monday, Israeli TV reported that Haifa&apos;s council had warned local businesses that they risked losing their licences if they employed African refugees, and that shopkeepers in the southern town of Sderot were refusing to serve migrants. Israeli statistics show some 60,000 African migrants have entered the country in the past seven years through the Egyptian Sinai desert \u2013 many of them asylum seekers fleeing repression or war in Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea. Israel, much like Europe, seems consumed with worry about being &quot;swamped&quot; by developing-world refugees \u2013 although, perhaps in part because of its location, the fears in Israel sound more visceral. So far, Israel&apos;s approach has been to build a steel fence on the Egyptian border and a giant detention centre in the south, and to pass a law that allows the detention of migrants for up to three years. Since its creation, fewer than 150 people have been recognised as refugees in Israel. The crude response from politicians has been as disturbing as the scenes on the streets. Last week, the interior minister, Eli Yishai, said: &quot;Most of those people arriving here are Muslims who think the country doesn&apos;t belong to us, the white man.&quot; He has also described the refugees as rapists and criminals. Weeks ago, Miri Regev, a Likud member of the Knesset, referred to Sudanese people in Israel as a cancer. Former TV presenter and emerging politician Yair Lapid last month lambasted some Knesset members as &quot;inciters&quot; leading a pogrom, and wrote: &quot;I wonder how they have the nerve to call themselves Jews.&quot; The sight of Jewish Israelis \u2013 sons and daughters of refugees \u2013 echoing, pretty much window-smashing act by act and racist line by line, scenes from historic anti-Jewish pogroms in Europe, isn&apos;t an easy one. Nor is the uncomfortable reality that hatred of refugees is so easily stoked in Israel. Having for years practised a policy of separation between Jews and subjugated Palestinians both in the occupied territories and within Israel, the country has incubated a form of casual racism and puritanical appraisal of the &quot;other&quot;, in which anti-migrant sentiments can flourish. Last month, the Israeli historian and commentator Tom Segev told AP: &quot;What disturbs me most is the racist atmosphere. For several years now, Israel society has been moving in that direction.&quot; At one protest against migrants last year, an Israeli demonstrator explained her hostility: &quot;They aren&apos;t Jews. Why should they be here with us?&quot; The language itself is a giveaway: protesters, politicians and reporters alike have labelled African refugees as infiltrators \u2013 the same fear-inducing, security-conscious term used to describe Palestinians. No wonder, then, that the Prevention of Infiltration Law, introduced during the 1950s to stop Palestinian refugees returning, has just been amended to apply to Africans. Meanwhile, gut-level anxiety over demographics are everywhere \u2013 rabbis and ministers are warning that migrants, just like Palestinians, will use a sort of birth-rate-bombing tactic in Israel, outnumbering the Jewish population and thereby sinking the nation. The rhetoric may be ramped up, but far-right Israeli ministers are basically repeating the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim sentiments of rising far-right parties in Europe. That isn&apos;t a coincidence because, perversely, the two have recently found common cause. In the past few years, Israeli ministers have played host to far-right European leaders and made clear the shared values on the supposed menace of Islam and (especially Muslim) migrants. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, is one of several far-right figures to have visited Israel and met hard-right ministers there. During one trip, Wilders met the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, and spoke of Israel as a front line in the fight to counter Islam. &quot;If Jerusalem falls,&quot; he warned, &quot;Amsterdam and New York will be next.&quot; This affiliation is great news for Europe&apos;s far-right parties, who seek to sanitise their image, and whose history of antisemitism has been a block to gaining mainstream acceptability. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research group, has warned that far-right parties in Europe are on the rise in part because they&apos;ve opportunistically buried antisemitism in favour of an apparently more palatable stance against Islam and Muslim migrants. How lucky for them that Jewish Israeli politicians are helping them with that. No doubt it&apos;s comforting for Israel&apos;s far right to find allies that lip-synch claims of a frontier battle. But when the people who perfectly understand you are also the ones with a history of violently hating you, it&apos;s time to worry about what exactly is in this relationship. Israel&apos;s current attacks on African refugees are bad enough, but if this outbreak even partly signals a dovetailing agenda between European fascists and far-right Israeli nationalists, that&apos;s a toxic arrangement \u2013 and trouble for migrants, Muslims and Jews everywhere.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-06T16:15:00Z", "title": "Far-right Europeans and Israelis: this toxic alliance spells trouble | Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["Last month, demonstrations against African refugees in Tel Aviv turned violent."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/israel-rightwing-europeans-migration-toxic"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli military has been accused of staging a photograph published to celebrate its progressive attitude to homosexuality.

After all, prayer was the first therapeutic intervention, and the Christian church has been at the honourable forefront of healing. Many treatments involved getting the patient to pray for their own recovery. But if prayer per se is of proven value, what happens when other people pray for you? One of the most authoritative scientific studies comes from a Christian organisation. Just last year Leanne Roberts, from the Southwark diocesan office, published a scholarly assessment of the power of prayer. Together with colleagues, she evaluated a number of research trials which involved nearly 8,000 patients. There was no difference overall in recovery from illness or death, whether subjects were prayed for or not. What if you do not know you are being prayed for? Or if the supplicants do not know for which patients they are pleading? One trial compared patients in a coronary care unit. Remarkably, those at high risk of death were more likely to live when prayed for. Cardiac surgery was more likely to be needed among those not &quot;receiving&quot; prayer. These studies do raise a number of difficulties. First, there may have been patients in either group who had friends praying for them without the knowledge of the investigators. And if God is truly omnipresent and all-knowing, he might confound those praying without true conviction. After all, God moves in mysterious ways. And what happens if, in a Christian setting, a Jew prayed for a Muslim or a Catholic? In 2001, Leonard Leibovici, of Tel Aviv university, published a study in the BMJ, testing the power of prayer. He argued that as we cannot assume a priori that time is linear, or that God is limited by linear time, why not pray for patients without their knowledge, after the disease has been treated? He conducted a trial that was randomised, blinded and statistically controlled involving 3,393 patients who had been treated in hospital for bloodstream infection. Years later, long after treatment had concluded, a short prayer was made for one group randomly assigned by the toss of a coin. The patients subjected to remote retroactive intercessory prayer tended to have less fever, reduced hospital stay and lower mortality. In these days of informed consent, it might seem morally indefensible to conduct a trial if patients do not know whether they are being prayed for or not, and Dr Leibovici says that this was difficult, indeed impossible in his study. Ethical issues are more relevant for Richard Scott. Of course, reports of what was actually said in the consulting room may be misleading. Did, for instance, Dr Scott really invoke the devil, as claimed by his patient? It is often thus \u2013 both doctors and their patients can have a biased recall of what actually was said. But Scott subsequently undermined his case. He apparently claimed that there was &quot;massive evidence&quot; supporting the value of faith, calling it &quot;the new specialism&quot;, stating that Christians are &quot;84% less suicidal&quot;. Leanne Roberts&apos; data show this is untrue \u2013 and where patients pray for themselves, there are few randomised trials comparing prayer with placebo treatments supporting Scott&apos;s assertion. Nearly all the trials are variously flawed or simply show the power of statistics, rather than the power of prayer. A patient in the consulting room is vulnerable and at least metaphorically naked. It is immoral for doctors to take advantage by promoting personal belief during consultations. To make matters worse, Dr Scott was treating a person in poor mental health. Rather than protesting, he should consider himself lucky he was not struck off the register.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T17:05:00Z", "title": "The 'Christian doctor' is lucky not to be struck off | Robert Winston", "sentences": ["In 2001, Leonard Leibovici, of Tel Aviv university, published a study in the BMJ, testing the power of prayer."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/jun/18/christian-doctor-lucky-not-struck-off"}, {"tags": ["Tricycle Theatre", "Stage", "Theatre", "Culture"], "article": "The Tricycle theatre on Kilburn High Road, in north-west London, is opposite Planet Pizza and Lanny&apos;s Barbar (sic) Shop. The entrance is discreet and the auditorium only seats 240, but since its foundation 32 years ago this small theatre has packed a hefty theatrical punch, pioneering tribunal plays, constructed from verbatim accounts of public inquiries, such as Half the Picture, based on the Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq by British companies, and The Colour of Justice, based on the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. For 28 of those years it was ruled by Nicolas Kent, but last year he announced he was stepping down as artistic director because of a \u00a3350,000 cut in the theatre&apos;s grant \u2013 a third of its subsidy. Kent is a hard act to follow, especially in straitened financial times, but Indhu Rubasingham, who formally took over from Kent a month ago and this week announces her first season, is as yet showing no signs of strain. &quot;I&apos;m an optimist,&quot; she says. &quot;The opportunity here is fantastic. You can change ways of thinking. Having been resistant to taking on a building, I&apos;ve realised the potential is huge. As a freelance director I used to be a commitment-phobe \u2013 it was like having a string of affairs. But now I feel I&apos;ve finally got married.&quot; She recognises the financial pressures will be considerable, but the Arts Council has at least agreed to cushion the impact of the cuts in her first year. Rubasingham, 42, wants to attract a younger and more diverse audience to the Tricycle, and her first season \u2013 four shows running from October \u2013 has a crowd-pleasing feel. Her debut show, which she will direct, is the world premiere of Red Velvet, a play by Lolita Chakrabarti about Ira Aldridge, Britain&apos;s first black classical actor. Rubasingham&apos;s trump card is that Chakrabarti&apos;s husband, Adrian Lester, will star as Aldridge. Red Velvet is followed by a Christmas show \u2013 a first for the Tricycle \u2013 based on the Arabian Nights; a comedy called One Monkey Don&apos;t Stop No Show about a middle-class black family in Philadelphia, which Rubasingham describes it as &quot;The Cosby Show meets restoration comedy&quot;; and Paper Dolls, another play with music (a term she prefers to musicals) about Filipino care workers in Tel Aviv who in their spare time form a cross-dressing cabaret group. &quot;It&apos;s about immigration, Israel, religion, sexuality \u2013 and it&apos;s got music!&quot; she says, making it sound like a Jewish-Filipino Full Monty. The trick will be to attract new audiences that better reflect the local community, the most diverse in London, without losing the old predominantly white, professional one. She reckons that if she can engage the myriad cultures that swirl around the Kilburn High Road, then by definition the work she is putting on has more than local significance. &quot;I&apos;m interested in looking at the world through different lenses,&quot; she says, &quot;and if I&apos;m speaking locally, I&apos;m speaking internationally.&quot; How hard is it to follow someone who did the job for so long? &quot;It&apos;s very daunting,&quot; she admits. &quot;Tricycle and Nic Kent are symbiotic, and there aren&apos;t many theatres like that.&quot; Some have suggested that he will still try to pull the strings from afar, but Rubasingham is sure he will let go. She has no plans to carry on the tradition of tribunal plays \u2013 the starry daily drama of Leveson suggests they would in any case find it hard to compete with the real thing. Rubasingham was born in Sheffield to parents who had migrated from Sri Lanka \u2013 her father was a doctor and she was heading in the same direction until a stint doing work experience at Nottingham Playhouse as a 16-year-old \u2013 but she doesn&apos;t want to be characterised as one of that rare breed, &quot;Asian women in the theatre&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m wary of reductiveness,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve done Asian plays, black plays, white plays. My passion is new writing.&quot; Some have suggested the fact she is female and of Asian origin made her the perfect candidate for the Tricycle. Does that rankle? &quot;People can say what they want,&quot; she says. &quot;It was my artistic vision that got me the job.&quot; She is the latest in a string of women to secure prominent artistic directorships, following Vicky Featherstone at the Royal Court and Josie Rourke at the Donmar. Why this sudden trend? &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any conscious decision to appoint lots of women artistic directors,&quot; she says. &quot;I just think there&apos;s a lot of talent out there.&quot; Will they bring a different perspective? &quot;It&apos;s really hard to answer that,&quot; she says, betraying a hint of exasperation. &quot;It would be like me asking you what do white male journalists bring?

And, despite the now-customary rebuff, she has not given up on the 10th Olympiad, shortly to begin in London. All she wants, as the widow of one of the 11 Israeli athletes killed in a terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics 40 years ago this summer, is an official moment of remembrance, a minute&apos;s silence, an acknowledgement of lost lives. Her decades-long battle goes beyond personal grief for a passionate love brutally cut short and for a newborn baby left without a father. It is also about the Olympic ideal, which puts the political differences and conflicts between nations to one side in pursuit of sporting excellence and athletic comradeship. &quot;Just do it once, and I&apos;ll be gone. I just want to hear it,&quot; she says at her home in Ramat Hasharon, near Tel Aviv. &quot;If they had granted a minute&apos;s silence, they would have got rid of us by now. But every four years we come back. We are a pain in the neck for them.&quot; The International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month again rejected a request by the relatives of the victims of the Munich massacre, which was carried out by the Palestinian group Black September, for a commemoration at the opening ceremony. Spitzer also received an emollient letter from Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London organising committee, which she describes with characteristic vim as &quot;bullshit&quot;. This year, Spitzer&apos;s drive has been reinforced by an online petition calling for a remembrance in London, which has exceeded its goal of 80,011 signatures \u2013 one for each seat at the Olympic stadium, plus one for each of the dead Israeli athletes. The families&apos; campaign for official remembrance began ahead of the Montreal Olympiad, which followed Munich, in 1976. &quot;We asked for a minute&apos;s silence, or some commemoration, because it was natural in our eyes,&quot; says Spitzer. &quot;But they told us very clearly: &apos;There are 21 Arab delegations that will leave if we say something about the Israeli athletes.&apos; So I said: &apos;Let them leave if they can&apos;t understand what the Olympics are all about \u2013 a connection between people through sport.&apos;&quot; The rejection has been repeated at every subsequent Olympiad. &quot;The IOC says it&apos;s not in the protocol of the opening ceremony to have a commemoration. Well, my husband coming home in a coffin was not in the protocol either. This was the blackest page in Olympic history. These 11 athletes were part of the Olympic family, they were not accidental tourists. They should be remembered as part of the Olympic framework.&quot; The current IOC president, Jacques Rogge, who was an athlete at the Munich Olympics, told Spitzer that rejecting the request had been his most difficult decision but his hands were tied. &quot;I said: &apos;No \u2013 my husband&apos;s hands were tied, his feet were tied, to the furniture.&apos; It&apos;s been 40 years. I feel like a fool, banging on doors every four years. But they have never had such an onslaught as this year. We will do everything in our power to try to change their minds.&quot; Rogge and Coe are &quot;nice people&quot;, says Spitzer. &quot;But they are impotent. I can only come to one conclusion or explanation: this is discrimination. I have never used that word in 40 years. But [the victims] had the wrong religion, they came from the wrong country.&quot; Ankie and Andrei Spitzer, a fencing coach, had been married for only 15 months when they travelled to Munich in July 1972. Ankie, from the Netherlands, was 26; Andrei was 27. They left their tiny daughter, two-week-old Anouk, with Ankie&apos;s parents in &apos;s-Hertogenbosch, in the south of Holland. A few days later the baby was admitted to hospital for observation because it wouldn&apos;t stop crying. After Andrei&apos;s events were over, the young couple briefly returned to the Netherlands to see Anouk. On 4 September, Andrei had to return to Munich but missed his train after stopping at the hospital to kiss his daughter goodbye. They raced in their car to the next station along the line, fearing a rebuke if Andrei stayed another day. Andrei leapt aboard the train as it pulled out of the station, with Ankie running along the platform to say goodbye. At around midnight, he called his wife from a payphone at the Olympic village. &quot;He said he only had one deutschmark, so we should talk quickly. He said: &apos;I love you.&apos; That was the last time I heard him,&quot; says Spitzer. The next morning, she awoke to a hostage crisis unfolding live before a global television audience. In the early hours, eight Palestinian militants, masquerading as athletes, had broken into the Olympic village and taken 11 Israelis hostage. Their demand was the release of 234 prisoners in Israeli jails. Andrei was among the hostages. &quot;We just waited. My family all came, but I didn&apos;t want to talk to anyone. I just followed it on television and the radio.&quot; The militants said they would start shooting the hostages at noon, one an hour, if their demands were not met \u2013 a deadline which was deferred twice during the afternoon. By then, two of the hostages had already been killed. &quot;Then suddenly, on TV, I saw Andrei in front of a window. The worst part was that he didn&apos;t have his glasses on. It was so humiliating, I knew he couldn&apos;t see anything. Then they hit him with a rifle and pushed him back in the room. That was the last time I saw him.&quot;     An armed German policeman during the seige in Munich. Photograph: Getty Images    Meanwhile, the German authorities were hatching plans to rescue the hostages, having rebuffed an offer to help from the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad. The first plan, to have policemen dressed as athletes storm the apartment in which the hostages were being held, was abandoned when it was realised that the Palestinian gunmen were watching live television pictures of the rescue effort being put into place. Another, which involved security personnel dressed as chefs delivering food to the apartment, was foiled when the militants simply instructed them to leave the supplies outside. As the drama intensified, the Games continued, and were only finally suspended late in the afternoon. Finally the gunmen demanded a plane to take them and the surviving nine hostages to Cairo. A new German plan, to take out the militants and rescue the hostages, was laid. Two helicopters transported the group to a nearby airport. But a series of blunders led the Palestinians to realise it was a trap. Just after 10.30pm, one militant threw a grenade into one of the helicopters, causing a massive conflagration. Another raked the second helicopter, containing five hostages, with machine-gun fire. Back in &apos;s-Hertogenbosch, Spitzer was glued to the television. &quot;You saw the flashes, heard the explosion and gunfire, but it was dark. I said: &apos;What the hell is going on?&apos;&quot; An hour later, a German government spokesman announced that the Israeli athletes had all been saved, and the Palestinians were all dead. &quot;How could this be? We saw the helicopter explode,&quot; recalls Spitzer. &quot;But my father said: &apos;This is the official spokesman, it must be right. I&apos;m going to open a big bottle of champagne.&apos; I replied: &apos;No champagne until I get a call from Andrei.&apos;&quot; But the only call came from the Israeli ambassador to The Hague. &quot;He said: &apos;This is wonderful news, now you can celebrate.&apos; He said he was going to bed.&quot; Spitzer was not reassured, and made repeated phone calls to the head of Israeli Olympic delegation seeking confirmation. &quot;At 3am I said: &apos;Please, just tell me what is happening.&apos; He said: &apos;The truth is, I don&apos;t know.&apos;&quot; Minutes later, there was another announcement on live television: &quot;Our worst fears have been realised tonight ... There were 11 hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They&apos;re all gone.&quot; Five of the Palestinian militants were also dead; three escaped. Desperate to get back to Munich, Spitzer was on the first flight a few hours later. She went to the apartment block which had housed the Israeli athletes, accompanied by another member of the fencing team. &quot;We opened the door to the building. [Yossef] Romano [a weightlifter who was the second hostage to be killed] had bled to death slowly in front of the others. His blood was coming down the stairs.&quot; Her escort pleaded with Spitzer to go no further. &quot;But I had to see where Andrei has spent the last hours of his life. You cannot imagine it. Blood, bullet-holes in the walls, food all over the floor. They didn&apos;t even let the hostages go to the bathroom. I looked to see what I could retrieve of Andrei&apos;s personal belongings. There was nothing except a little mascot, a toy dachsund, that he had bought for the baby.&quot;     Ankie Spitzer in the room in the Olympic village where her husband was held. Photograph: AP    The mascot is now in a museum in Tel Aviv, along with other items belonging to Andrei \u2013 his fencing gear, the special kippa he wore for the opening ceremony, the sole photograph of Andrei with his baby. Spitzer has kept two black and white portraits of her husband, which sit on her desk overlooking her garden where the couple&apos;s daughter, Anouk, will get married next month. On 7 September, the young widow flew back to Israel with the surviving members of the Olympic team and 10 coffins, including the one containing Andrei&apos;s body. Her Dutch family and her child were whisked to a safe house in Holland for 20 days, as the authorities feared they could be at risk of another attempted attack. Spitzer, frantic to communicate with her family, was forbidden direct contact. Eventually, after a clandestine reunion with Anouk at Tel Aviv airport late at night, mother and daughter were kept under Israeli security service watch for six months. &quot;Everyone here in Israel thought I&apos;d take the baby and go back to Holland. But I wanted Anouk to understand what happened. I wanted her not to be special. Here, especially after the [1973] Yom Kippur war, there were other children who had lost their fathers. In an unnatural situation, this was the most natural place for her. And I&apos;m still here.&quot; Spitzer took on the German government as well as the IOC. &quot;They made so many incredible mistakes. Everything went wrong. I wanted all the information from the Germans, I wanted to nail them in court. They insisted they didn&apos;t have anything.&quot; After 20 years, she was finally given access to more than 4,000 files of documents and 900 pathological photographs. A court case brought by relatives was thrown out on the basis of Germany&apos;s statute of limitations. Eventually, an out-of-court settlement was reached with the families, although Spitzer herself opposed a deal. But at least, she says, &quot;it was an admission of responsibility. The money meant nothing.&quot; Ten years after Munich, she remarried and had three more children. She became a journalist for a Dutch television channel and \u2013 at 66 and now divorced \u2013 she is &quot;still running around Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon&quot;. She describes interviewing the late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat with shaking hands, the present Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat&apos;s widow Suhar, and the widow of Khalil Al Wazir, or Abu Jihad, one of the masterminds of the Munich massacre who was assassinated in Tunis in 1988 by Mossad agents. In none of these interviews, conducted using her professional name, did she disclose her personal history. &quot;Many people ask how, with my background, I can report objectively about the Palestinian problem. But I can look at the Palestinian people, and they are not all potential terrorists. The people I meet in Gaza and the West Bank have nothing to do with the massacre in Munich. &quot;For two months after Munich, I went around like a raging bull. I wanted someone to pay for this. This peace-loving man I was married to, who didn&apos;t do wrong to anyone \u2013 they did this to him, and now somebody&apos;s going to pay for it. But then I realised I couldn&apos;t raise Anouk with hatred in my heart. You cannot live like this, you have to leave it. It is not that I would embrace the guys who killed my husband, far from it, but it has nothing to do with the Palestinian population as a whole. &quot;But this happened to me. It&apos;s part of my life. I have a daughter who never knew her father. We cannot forget what happened.&quot; After Munich \u2013 what happened next Following the Munich massacre, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir ordered the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad, to track down and assassinate those responsible. The mission, known as Operation Wrath of God, spanned Europe, North Africa and the Middle East over many years. Agents eliminated more than a dozen militants connected to Black September and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, plus at least one innocent man, a Moroccan waiter working in Norway. Israel&apos;s current defence minister Ehud Barak took part in an operation in Lebanon, in which three Palestinian militants were killed and four others died. Of the eight gunmen who took part in the Munich massacre, five were killed at the airport the same night, and two were either assassinated or died later.

In the present stalemate, recent efforts by several foreign governments \u2013 including South Africa and Denmark \u2013 to insist on a clear distinction between products originating in Israel and those from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are significant. These efforts can help pave the way to peace. Last month, South African and Danish governments announced their intention to prevent goods produced in settlements from being labeled as &apos;Made in Israel&apos;, following the United Kingdom, which has requested its supermarkets to label settlement goods differently since 2009. The Swiss retail chain Migros has now also decided to do so. These actions should be applauded and other governments and companies should follow suit. Why? Because the settlements are not Israel. They are built on occupied land outside Israel&apos;s internationally recognised borders and are illegal under international law. Labelling produce from settlements as Made in Israel misleads the consumer, and implicitly condones the expansionist policy of Israel&apos;s rightwing government led by Binyamin Netanyahu. Right now, the Palestinian West Bank is being gobbled up by growing settlements, erasing the Green Line \u2013 the internationally recognised pre-1967 line, which is the only viable basis for peace. At the time of the signing of Oslo peace accord in 1993, we had around 250,000 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories. By 2000, when I was director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the number stood at 390,000. Today it is over 550,000.Following Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s rejection of US President Barack Obama&apos;s plea to freeze settlement growth, we have seen a major acceleration in settlement construction. Only this month, Netanyahu announced plans to build another 851 settler homes, many of them deep inside Palestinian territory. It seems that we Israelis have come to the conclusion that we no longer need peace. Behind the separation wall and with the army&apos;s might, we are more or less safe without peace. The economy is growing, and Tel Aviv is booming. The occupation is not a source of great moral discomfort to us. Except for the minority which does combat military service, the military oppression of Palestinians is out of sight and out of mind for the average Israeli. Many of us tend to believe that the conflict can be managed for everand Israel no longer has a &quot;Palestinian problem&quot;. However, this is pure self-deception. The continuing settlement expansion threatens to make a two-state solution to the conflict impossible. Israel is sliding into a situation where, short of apartheid or expulsion of the Palestinians, a one-state solution with equal rights for all could become the only possible way out of the conflict. This is the South African model. As Israel&apos;s past ambassador to South Africa I feel able to venture a view on the applicability of that model to Israel-Palestine. Unlike in South Africa, where urbanisation brought black people to the cities in such numbers that they eventually became the majority, in Israel there is substantial territorial separation and significant replacement of Palestinian labour by foreign workers, especially from Asia. Whereas in South Africa almost every white child was cared for in infancy by a black &quot;nanny&quot;, there is little contact between Israelis and Palestinians at all. Despite my deep admiration for the\u00a0way South Africa brokered its own\u00a0peace, a &quot;South African-style&quot; solution for Israel-Palestine would be the end of the Jewish state. The two-state model remains the only way to fulfil this dream of at least the last four Jewish generations. So, if we want to stick to the two-state solution, then we must begin to seriously tackle the settlement expansion which poses an existential threat to it. Here lies the relevance of the symbolic act of preventing settlement products from being marked as Made in Israel. By denying this label to settlement products, international governments protect and reinforce the pre-1967 border. Moreover, they give their own consumers the free choice of whether to buy products from settlements. This simple act reminds us that settlements are a grave violation of international law and an instrument in a dangerous project of de facto annexation. By defining and promoting the conflict&apos;s solution along the pre-1967 line, the international community confirms that the goal is two states, not\u00a0an Israeli apartheid state. \u2022 Comments for this article may close overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-06-27T17:34:55Z", "title": "For Israelis, Palestinian oppression is out of sight and out of mind | Alon Liel", "sentences": ["The economy is growing, and Tel Aviv is booming."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/27/made-in-israel-erasing-green-line"}, {"tags": ["Train crashes"], "article": "It was a very hot afternoon in June 2005, and my friend Leah and I were waiting for the rush hour train from Tel\u00a0Aviv. We were tired after a\u00a0day of teacher training and couldn&apos;t wait to get back to Be&apos;er Sheva where we were living. When the train arrived, we\u00a0got into the second carriage from the front; it was packed and becoming busier at each stop. The air-conditioning wasn&apos;t working at the rear, so the front was particularly crowded that day. I sat by the window admiring the changing landscape, from city to farmland. I\u00a0remember talking to Leah about skydiving, telling her it was the most exciting thing I&apos;d ever done. Suddenly we felt an enormous pressure pushing us backwards into our seats. The windows smashed into tiny fragments and dust flew around violently. I could barely open my eyes. All I could hear was the heavy drone of metal-on-metal, and silence from the passengers. The train was crashing, and it didn&apos;t feel as if it was going to stop. When it did, I thought, I would be dead. I thought about my boyfriend, Guy, and that he would receive the news first. I went through every family member and friend, wondering how each would deal with my death and thinking how much I\u00a0loved them. Then I thought about myself \u2013 I was 24, too young to die. Voices began to break through my thoughts. &quot;What&apos;s happening?&quot; they said and, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; Strangely, I\u00a0was totally calm. I\u00a0wasn&apos;t panicking; my heart wasn&apos;t even beating fast, When the train finally came to a\u00a0halt, we slowly stood up, pushing off the table that had fallen on to us; others stayed in their seats and many were covered in blood. The dust was beginning to settle but there was glass everywhere. People nearby were silent, but outside I\u00a0could hear screaming. A soldier pushed open the mangled door for us to escape and held our hands as we jumped off the train. Outside we found more bloodied people, crying, panicking, talking on their phones or simply looking dazed. Our carriage had been derailed, but the front one had taken the main impact \u2013 crushed, it lay on its side facing in another direction. We were halfway between Tel Aviv and home, surrounded by fields of sunflowers. We had patches of blood on us and I remember searching my body for wounds, but I didn&apos;t find any. My knees felt painful and my hips were bruised, and Leah had cut her hand jumping off the train, but that was it. I rang Guy, who was very calm and said he would come and get us. I thought, OK, it&apos;s over, we&apos;re going home \u2013 the end. Helicopters landed and we saw scared-looking soldiers running out with stretchers. All around us were ambulances, high-visibility jackets and people lying on the ground. Everyone was shouting for help. One man was lying on the embankment, facing up with a blank expression. When I turned to look back at him, someone was covering his face. It was almost dark by the time we found Guy and he drove us home. Slowly I became inconsolable as I realised what we had just been through. My father arrived on the next flight from London to find me unable to eat, sleep or talk, in a daze of confusion, watching the news channels, trying to find out what had happened. Why wasn&apos;t I\u00a0injured? Why did I survive? I think it was a\u00a0mixture of luck and where we were sitting, so the force of the crash pushed us into our seats, rather than across the train. In the days that followed, I\u00a0convinced myself I had internal bleeding. I went to hospital, but I\u00a0was fine: I think it was just part of the emotional trauma I was feeling. I&apos;d survived one of Israel&apos;s worst ever train crashes \u2013 eight people died and at least 200 were injured. The train had collided with a coal truck 25 miles south of Tel Aviv. It\u00a0had been travelling at more than 70mph at impact and had continued on the line for at least a\u00a0couple of kilometres. Even now, no\u00a0one knows why it happened. For weeks I was a wreck, suffering from hallucinations and guilt. But slowly I began to see the crash as a\u00a0catalyst for change. I moved back to Britain to begin university and now have a job I love, promoting the benefits of growing food in the city. Seven years later, I have come to terms with my survivor&apos;s guilt. I feel grateful and happy that I&apos;m alive \u2013 but I still won&apos;t sit at the front of a\u00a0train. \u2022 Do you have an experience to share?

I want to joke that it&apos;s only the C of E that, unable to sort out the simple question of whether women should be bishops, decides to tackle the problems of the Middle East. But as any column about Israel-Palestine \u2013 especially written by a Christian \u2013 places one&apos;s head immediately next to several whirring meat slicers, I am going to make this the last quip on the issue. So to the facts. The motion that was overwhelmingly passed endorsed the work of two organisations, the Parents Circle Family Forum (PCFF) and the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI). The first of these is uncontroversial. The Parents Circle is a joint Palestinian-Israeli organisation of more than 600 families, working for peace and reconciliation, all of whom have lost a close family member as a result of the conflict. Last month in the speaker&apos;s rooms in the House of Commons, Robi Damelin, whose son David was killed by a Palestinian sniper, told a gathering of mostly British Jews and some (but not many) Muslims, that if they hadn&apos;t anything useful to contribute to the peace process, it was better if they just shut up. Those safely living more than 2,000 miles from the conflict have no right to make things more difficult for those struggling to find common ground in the midst of so much death and suffering. Her point was well made. Indeed, the Parents Circle has acquired so much credibility for its heroic efforts at peacebuilding that few would challenge its right to say sharp things to both communities. But EAPPI is a different kettle of fish. Last week, the chief rabbi, Lord Sacks, warned the synod against passing the motion in support of EAPPI. &quot;It would do serious damage to Jewish-Christian relations in Britain, which have been so positive in recent decades.&quot; Following the vote, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Vivian Wineman, condemned the synod for choosing to &quot;promote an inflammatory and partisan programme at the expense of its interfaith relations&quot;. EAPPI is a programme set up by the World Council of Churches and currently run in this country by the Quakers, who have a distinguished record on peace and justice issues. It originated in a request made by the Jerusalem churches &quot;for the protection of our people&quot; and seeks to bring international volunteers to the West Bank to offer this protection for Palestinians (some of whom are Christians) through a non-violent presence, accompanying children to school, farmers in their olive fields and visitors through Israeli checkpoints. It seeks to report human rights abuses by the Israeli army and settlers and supports acts of non-violent resistance to the occupation, including boycotts. During the debate the archbishop of Canterbury spoke of his &quot;respect and gratitude for the immense courage and dedication of the volunteers&quot; and said that &quot;there are some people who, in their uncritical assumption that the Israeli government can do no wrong, are clearly going to be very irritated by \u2026 EAPPI&quot;. The gap between Rowan Williams and the chief rabbi \u2013 usually regarded as two peas in a pod \u2013 has rarely seemed wider. Which may be why, despite his obvious commitment to EAPPI, Williams supported an amendment that sought unsuccessfully to delete references to specific organisations in the synod motion. So how far can any Christian church go in challenging the conduct of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians, many of them Christians? To what extent does the western church&apos;s responsibility for centuries of antisemitism require that it remain silent on such issues? The specific beef that many in the Jewish community have with EAPPI is that those who return from the volunteer programme can end up with a one-sided view of the conflict. And there is some anecdotal evidence that volunteers who have spoken to church groups about their experiences on the West Bank have not always been careful enough to distinguish criticism of Israeli policy from criticism of Jews per se. If this is the case it must be strongly challenged. The specific brief of EAPPI volunteers is to protect vulnerable Palestinians from bullying and intimidation. This is important and necessary work. I support it. But, in itself, it does not offer a 360-degree appreciation of the situation. Where EAPPI is open to challenge is if those who return from 40 days at an Israel checkpoint believe that this qualifies them as mini-experts on the entire politics of the region. They need also to have danced on the bar in Nanuchka in secular Tel Aviv. And have seen children in Gaza handing out sweets when an Israeli soldier has been shot. And been though the heartache of failed peace and broken dreams. And a thousand thousand other experiences besides. It is here that the Parents Circle is a different kind of thing to EAPPI. Nonetheless, the friends of Israel do themselves few favours if they insist that all criticisms of Israel&apos;s behaviour towards Palestinians are motivated by one-sidedness or hostility to Jews. I&apos;m not saying this happens all the time. But when it does, those of us who want to be critical friends of Israel (and Palestine) find that the ground on which we stand is constantly eroded. I believe in the existence of the state of Israel and in its need for security. But the &quot;with us or against us&quot; approach needs to be resisted at all times. And that means holding a position that is likely to draw vociferous criticism from several different quarters. But unless this ground can be held, we concede to a dangerous binary division that can only be settled by further violence. To spell it out: critical friends have a responsibility to be both critical and to be friends.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-12T12:40:00Z", "title": "Should the Church of England remain silent on Israel-Palestine? | Giles Fraser", "sentences": ["They need also to have danced on the bar in Nanuchka in secular Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/jul/12/church-of-england-silent-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Crosswords"], "article": "Across 1 Kingdom of Heaven KIN/GOD(part anag)/MO/F&lt;have(part anag)&gt;EN9 overeaten OVER + Eton (hom)10 admit double def11 Sheldon S&lt;HELD&gt;ON [Sheldonian Theatre]12 angrier (sh)ANGRI(-la)/ER [James Hilton&apos;s Lost Horizon]14 hapence PEN on EACH (anag) [half a penny]17 Tullius TULL/1/US [Jethro Tull]19 the lump TH&lt;EL&gt;UMP22 rich man double/cryptic def [Dives, the rich man]24 ado AD 025 skinful S&lt;K&gt;INFUL26 Tel Aviv VIVA LET (rev)28 heart HE/ART29 municipal MUNIC(h)/1/PAL30 the eye of a needle the knee of an idol (Spoonsrism) Down 1 knows what is what SAW WITH THANKS WO (anag)2 niece Nice (homo)3 Dresden DR/NEEDS(part anag) [Dresden china]4 matinee M&lt;A/TINE&gt;E5 fantast inFANT A STudy (hidden)6 evangel LEG/NAVE (rev)7 vampirism V/AMP/IRIS/M [5 amp fuses for lights]8 net present value PRESENT in EVENTUAL (anag)15 predicate P&lt;CIDER(part rev)&gt;ATE [part of a sentence]16,13 camels CAM/ELS18 uni U(lster)/N(orthern) I(reland)20 unfitly FUN(anag)/IT(a)LY21 Palumbo P&lt;A&gt;LUMB/O22 rotunda ROT + under (hom)23 caleche CA&lt;LE&gt;CHE27 vapid V&lt;A/P&gt;ID", "publicationDate": "2012-07-13T14:00:00Z", "title": "Annotated solutions for Prize 25,682", "sentences": ["Across 1 Kingdom of Heaven KIN/GOD(part anag)/MO/F&lt;have(part anag)&gt;EN9 overeaten OVER + Eton (hom)10 admit double def11 Sheldon S&lt;HELD&gt;ON [Sheldonian Theatre]12 angrier (sh)ANGRI(-la)/ER [James Hilton&apos;s Lost Horizon]14 hapence PEN on EACH (anag) [half a penny]17 Tullius TULL/1/US [Jethro Tull]19 the lump TH&lt;EL&gt;UMP22 rich man double/cryptic def [Dives, the rich man]24 ado AD 025 skinful S&lt;K&gt;INFUL26 Tel Aviv VIVA LET (rev)28 heart HE/ART29 municipal MUNIC(h)/1/PAL30 the eye of a needle the knee of an idol (Spoonsrism) Down 1 knows what is what SAW WITH THANKS WO (anag)2 niece Nice (homo)3 Dresden DR/NEEDS(part anag) [Dresden china]4 matinee M&lt;A/TINE&gt;E5 fantast inFANT A STudy (hidden)6 evangel LEG/NAVE (rev)7 vampirism V/AMP/IRIS/M [5 amp fuses for lights]8 net present value PRESENT in EVENTUAL (anag)15 predicate P&lt;CIDER(part rev)&gt;ATE [part of a sentence]16,13 camels CAM/ELS18 uni U(lster)/N(orthern) I(reland)20 unfitly FUN(anag)/IT(a)LY21 Palumbo P&lt;A&gt;LUMB/O22 rotunda ROT + under (hom)23 caleche CA&lt;LE&gt;CHE27 vapid V&lt;A/P&gt;ID"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2012/jul/13/prize-crossword-annotated-solution-25682"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "  When Israeli pop superstar Rita Jahanforuz told her friends she wanted to record an album in Farsi, they thought she must have gone mad. The 50-year-old Iranian-born, Jewish singer, who is usually known just by her first name, recalled: &quot;&apos;They all said, &apos;You want to record an album in the language of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad? Who will listen to it?&apos; I didn&apos;t know why I had to do it, I just did. It&apos;s like someone lit a match. What&apos;s happening now is beyond what I ever imagined.&quot; What&apos;s happening now is the rarest of musical occurrences \u2013 an album that is a big hit simultaneously in both Israel and Iran. My Joys \u2013 composed of popular Iranian ballads sung in Farsi \u2013 went gold in Israel within three weeks of its release. Sales figures from Iran are harder to come by, though reports indicate it has flown off the shelves of those music shops that covertly sold the CD with a blank cover. Determined Iranian fans are using sophisticated software to bypass the Islamic regime&apos;s tight internet controls and download the album and playing it at weddings and underground nightclubs across Tehran. Admiring anything Israeli, let alone a sexy female singer, is risky in Iran. Women are forbidden from performing in public. Female musicians that do perform give clandestine concerts in the basements of private homes. &quot;Music from Israel is interesting because it comes from the epitome of evil \u2013 people are curious,&quot; said Liora Hendelmann-Baavur, expert in Iranian popular culture at Tel Aviv University. Officials in Tehran were not impressed. While the Washington Post has hailed her as an &quot;anti-war spokesperson&quot;, Fars, a news agency affiliated with Iran&apos;s government, accused Rita of being Israel&apos;s &quot;latest plot in a soft war&quot;. Rita finds this idea hilarious. In response, she flicked through her iPhone, searching for an email she considered much more significant than the opinion of the military guard. &quot;I&apos;m from Iran. I don&apos;t know you but I would like to express my feelings about you \u2026 I love you, I love you, I love you. God bless you and your country,&quot; she said, reading out the email. She then exclaimed triumphantly: &quot;These are the real people! They understand that I am trying to show Iran&apos;s real culture, it&apos;s true beautiful self, which has become lost to the outside world because of its government.&quot; There are 250,000 Iranian Jews living in Israel, of which Rita is probably the most famous and well-loved. She was named the country&apos;s &quot;top female singer of the past 60 years&quot; during anniversary celebrations in 2010. She clings to her Iranian roots but is proudly Israeli. Her family moved to Israel in 1970 when she was eight but Rita remembers her childhood in Iran with fond nostalgia. Her earliest memories are of her mother singing and dancing through the house, songs she has revisited on this album. A tribute to this early inspiration, the diva invited her 72-year-old mother to sing the album&apos;s final track. Rita remembers seeing her father sitting, glued to the radio, smoking cigarette after cigarette. When she asked what was wrong, she remembers her mother telling her that there was a war in Israel \u2013 the six-day war of 1967. &quot;I couldn&apos;t understand the idea of war. I could grasp one person or a couple of people being angry with each other but how could a whole country of people be angry at exactly the same time with a whole other country of people?&quot; she asked. &quot;In the end, what matters is not the few people at the top, it is us, the people. The reaction to this album has convinced me that love is the only reasonable action in the world.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 14 July 2012.

A new bill allowing the draft is due to be submitted for its first reading in the Knesset, following a ruling by the country&apos;s supreme court that the Tal Law, exempting Haredi Jews from military service, was unconstitutional. That law is due to expire on 1 August, but what will replace it has become the subject of ferocious argument over one of the most sensitive issues in Israeli society. As Netanyahu faced a weekend of crisis talks with his deputy and political rival, Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz, senior government sources conceded that their chances of reaching a solution to save their coalition were slim. Mofaz argues that Haredi conscription is essential to share the burden of service that now falls on secular Israelis, who serve three years in the military after attending high school and can be called up for reserve duty until the age of 45. Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party agrees in part but insists that to force the Haredim \u2013 a population of around 700,000 \u2013 into the army in &quot;one fell swoop&quot; after 64 years of exemption is impossible. &quot;I would like to see the Haredim join the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] at 18 years old,&quot; Moshe Ya&apos;alon, strategic affairs minister and an ally of Netanyahu&apos;s, told Israel&apos;s army radio last week. &quot;But if we try this, we will start a civil war.&quot; The debate has gripped the Jewish state. For Israel&apos;s ultra-Orthodox, the preservation of the Haredim&apos;s right to study rather than serve represents a battle for the preservation of the Jewish people, pitting the value of the body against the worth of the soul. In Haredi communities the mood is defiant. Mea Shearim is a closed, strictly ultra-Orthodox community on the outskirts of Jerusalem&apos;s Old City. Apart from the murmur of prayers in the yeshivas and the occasional shout of young schoolboys, its old stone alleyways are hushed. Men in broad hats and frockcoats walk the streets quickly, their eyes cast to the ground. Life here has not changed for hundreds of years and no one thinks it will change now. &quot;The best life in the world is from those red traffic lights until the end of this street,&quot; boasted Yossi, 28, indicating the borders of Mea Shearim where he was born and raised. &quot;About 50% of people here do not hold Israeli IDs. They were here hundreds of years before Israel. The government can do whatever it wants; the people here will go and sit in jail rather than go to the army. They will never serve.&quot; Pointing out a woman who was covered head to toe in black, lace covering her face and pushing a pram briskly along the pavement \u2013 her child also entirely obscured with black cloth \u2013 he said people here were becoming more religious. Yossi did serve in the army but he describes himself as religious rather than Orthodox. &quot;My father didn&apos;t speak to me when I joined the army. He said, &apos;I&apos;m not your father any more.&apos; But after two years he got over it,&quot; he said. &quot;I think a little differently. I believe if you take from the government you have to give back to it.&quot; This is the opinion of most Israelis, many of whom are outraged that the state pours money into a community that does not work, typically has large numbers of children, does not pay taxes and does not serve in the military. Last Saturday about 20,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv to demand that the country&apos;s Orthodox and Arab citizens share the burden of military service. Senior retired military figures and political leaders, including the former opposition leader Tzipi Livni, joined the crowd of protesters, calling for &quot;one people, one draft&quot;. Yosam Merav, a 16-year-old from Tel Aviv, stood with his father in front of a sign reading &quot;the suckers&apos; tent&quot;. He said: &quot;I&apos;m about to be enlisted. I&apos;m happy to serve but I want to feel like the country I serve is a country where everything is equal. I don&apos;t want to feel like a sucker.&quot; Yaakov Uri, who runs a pizza parlour in Geula, an Orthodox neighbourhood in Jerusalem, said the problem was that secular Israelis like Yosam had no understanding of the sacrifices religious Jews make for them. &quot;You think it&apos;s so easy to sit and study all day, bring up seven children on $700 a month? No, it&apos;s very hard,&quot; he said. These men, in his opinion, are as critical for the defence of Israel as the army. They provide spiritual protection. &quot;The Torah is saving and guarding the Jews,&quot; Uri said. &quot;Take the Iraq war. Saddam Hussein sent 39 Scud missiles into Israel. They didn&apos;t touch anyone. What is this? It wasn&apos;t the army \u2013 they sat with their arms folded. It was the Torah,&quot; he said. &quot;There many kinds of soldiers, on planes, on ships, but also in the yeshiva.&quot; As a compromise, he suggested that yeshiva students who were not truly devoted to Torah studies \u2013 around one-third, he thought \u2013 should serve in the army. But this was provided, of course, that they were served kosher food, given enough time to pray and segregated from women. Like Uri, Yakov Horowitz believes that the current crisis is the result of the ignorance of secular Israelis. Formerly a barrister in the United States, he is now an Orthodox rabbi running a religious school in Mea Shearim. &quot;Mofaz is just a politician trying to get votes, but I&apos;d like to tell him you are hurting yourself more than you realise,&quot; Horowitz said. &quot;The burden is equal already, shared between the body and the soul. If the soul is not getting an equal part in the battle against our enemies, we will lose. It would be a fatal mistake.&quot; Like Moshe Ya&apos;alon, Horowitz warned that, if the Haredim were pushed into the army, the result would be explosive. People who valued the Haredim&apos;s role in society, he said, would protect it &quot;by any means possible&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-14T11:53:00Z", "title": "Israeli coalition split by demands to make ultra-Orthodox Jews serve in army", "sentences": ["Last Saturday about 20,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv to demand that the country&apos;s Orthodox and Arab citizens share the burden of military service.", "Yosam Merav, a 16-year-old from Tel Aviv, stood with his father in front of a sign reading &quot;the suckers&apos; tent&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/14/netanyahu-coalition-split-draft-orthodox"}, {"tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Bread"], "article": "People often ask if this job brings with it any special perks \u2013 and until recently I would always tell them &quot;no&quot;. Unless, of course, you consider a free bottle of Starburst-branded, fruit-flavoured milk drink to be a perk (it arrived in the post some months ago; I dispatched it to the dustbin moments later). But then a man called Michael Leventhal asked me if I\u00a0would like to be a judge at his Jewish food festival, Gefiltefest, in May \u2013 and suddenly a massive perk was heading my way. I would be spending a whole hour tasting challah (the Sabbath bread), bagels and cheesecake. It was a strange kind of day, not least because I began it at the first communion of my twin nieces. No, I&apos;m not Jewish (I&apos;m not Catholic either, but that&apos;s a whole other story) \u2013 though in 1979 I was the proud winner of the Tu Bishvat competition at Tabeetha School, in Jaffa, my alma mater (Tu Bishvat is the Jewish New Year of the Trees, and you celebrate it by eating figs, dates, apricots and almonds). Needless to say, at Gefiltefest, in Golders Green, I was the only shiksa on the panel. At one point, the judge next to me \u2013 Alan Lee, co-owner of London&apos;s hottest kosher restaurant, Deli West One \u2013 said: &quot;You like sweet things. You must have Polish roots.&quot; I\u00a0didn&apos;t have the heart to tell him that my roots, in as far as I have any, are Northern chapel and Norwegian. But I digress. We duly tasted the challah, bagels and cheesecake, and the winner of each category by about a\u00a0million miles was Sharon&apos;s of Stamford Hill. This was exciting! A reliable purveyor of three of my favourite baked goods was, it seemed, to be found only 15 minutes from my house. A few days later, I rang Sharon&apos;s, and asked to speak to its manager, Shuki Mozes. I wanted him to tell me all about \u2013 this was how I\u00a0pictured it \u2013 his little artisan bakery. No doubt his challah was baked to a family recipe, one that had followed its members across Europe, and was now kept safely under lock and key. But, no. &quot;We&apos;ve been open 23 years,&quot; he said. &quot;We have five branches, and we supply Tesco and Sainsbury&apos;s, too.&quot; As you can imagine, this rather took the wind out of my sails. Shuki would not reveal to me why Sharon&apos;s challah is so ambrosial, the burnished crust giving way to a\u00a0sublimely chewy interior \u2013 though he did say that, unlike most challah, it would not go stale five minutes after leaving the shop. Nor would he give me his bagel recipe. Should cheesecake taste mostly of vanilla, or mostly of lemon? I asked. &quot;Neither,&quot; he said. And then: &quot;It should taste of cheese.&quot; Of course, I&apos;ve had good bagels before, and cheesecake is a cinch to make at home. But challah? This is a\u00a0trickier thing. When my family first tasted it, one Friday evening in 1978 \u2013 we were living in Tel Aviv; you couldn&apos;t get challah in Sheffield, or not where we lived \u2013 we could not get over the disappointment. The loaf looked so beautiful, plaited to symbolise love, and sprinkled with poppy seeds to symbolise the manna that fell from heaven, its crust shining like a pair of polished brogues (challah is glazed with beaten eggs and sometimes honey, too). But you struggled to slice the thing, and then, after all that, it tasted so bland. Plus, as Shuki suggests, by the time Saturday morning came around, it was mostly only good for toasting. Later, when I saw challah described as one of the two great breads of the Ashkenazi world in Claudia Roden&apos;s Book of Jewish Food (the other being the bagel), I was \u2013 whisper it \u2013 inclined to sneer. Thanks to the estimable Sharon&apos;s, though, I now realise that, done right, it is wonderful: so seductively yielding, once you get inside. But do Shuki and his bakers change the shape of their loaves according to the time of year? I forgot to ask. But the routine goes, I think, like this: at Rosh Hashanah (New Year), loaves may be round, to symbolise continuity (no beginning, and no end); at Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), they may be shaped like a ladder to symbolise the great heights we hope to reach in the coming year; and at Purim, they may be triangular, to symbolise the ears of the evil Haman, whose plan to exterminate the Jews is defeated in the Book of Esther. Alas, no one seems to bake tree-shaped Tu Bishvat bread \u2013 though any questions you may have about this particular festival, I will almost certainly be able to answer if I\u00a0really put my mind to it.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-14T23:08:00Z", "title": "The day I judged a Jewish food festival", "sentences": ["When my family first tasted it, one Friday evening in 1978 \u2013 we were living in Tel Aviv; you couldn&apos;t get challah in Sheffield, or not where we lived \u2013 we could not get over the disappointment."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/challah-bagel-jewish-food-festival"}, {"tags": ["The far right", "France", "Marine Le Pen", "Europe", "Madonna", "Music", "Culture", "World news", "Paris"], "article": "     France&apos;s far-right Front National (FN) is to sue Madonna for using a picture of its leader with a swastika on her forehead. A spokesman for Marine Le Pen, the FN president who came third in the May presidential elections, said a lawsuit for &quot;public insult&quot; would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. At a concert in the French capital on Saturday evening, the American singer showed a video in which Le Pen&apos;s face appears with other well-known figures including Pope Benedict, Chinese leader Hu Jintao and US Republican Sarah Palin. In the clip, shown on a giant screen to accompany the song Nobody Knows Me, Le Pen, 43, appears with the Nazi symbol overlaid on her face, just before an image resembling Adolf Hitler. The image sent a ripple through the crowd at Le Stade de France, where Madonna was performing as part of her 80-date world tour.

Israel&apos;s year-long social protest movement had previously been characterised by a carnival atmosphere. But on Sunday rumours spread among the crowd massed outside the ministry of social security that Silman had died. Tearful protesters bore placards declaring: &quot;I have flammable potential too.&quot; Silman, in fact, remains in a critical condition in hospital. Activists report that his organs are failing and his chances of survival are slim. As unsubstantiated reports filtered through that another man had set himself alight in a copycat demonstration elsewhere in the country, protest leaders instructed the crowd through megaphones that they do not support or encourage self-immolation. Tens of thousands demonstrated across Israel last year demanding cheaper housing and a lower cost of living. The protest has since petered out, without the movement&apos;s demands being met. &quot;So far this has been a middle class protest. I think [Silman&apos;s] act will draw in the working classes,&quot; filmmaker and activist Danny Rosenberg, 32, suggested. &quot;This summer&apos;s protests will be more concentrated \u2013 and potentially more violent.&quot; The majority of around 10,000 protesters had left on Saturday evening when Silman doused himself in petrol and set himself alight. He had distributed several copies of a suicide note explaining that despite having done his military service and paying high health insurance bills, he could no longer afford his medicine bills or his rent. &quot;I blame the state of Israel. I blame Bibi Netanyahu [the prime minister] and Yuval Steinitz [the finance minister] both scum for the humiliation and disenfranchisement citizens experience every day. &quot;I refuse to be homeless,&quot; he wrote. Netanyahu described the incident as &quot;a human tragedy&quot;. Sunday&apos;s protesters roamed between ministry buildings and stormed major roads, including the arterial Ayalon highway, where traffic was brought to a halt. Drivers caught in the chaos were for the most part sympathetic. Standing beside his stationary car in the middle of a four-lane highway, Adi, 28, was anxious get home to revise for an economics exam the next morning. But was supportive of the demonstrators and expressed deep sympathy for Silman. &quot;I have a wife and a young kid. We both earn very well and yet we can&apos;t afford our own home.

In the valley below, minefields, barbed wire fences and a blue UN flag mark the frontline between the two most powerful armies in the Middle East. Behind it is a country in the throes of civil war. Round the clock, from its perch on Mount Avital, the Israeli army&apos;s unit 8200 eavesdrops on Syria, a former bastion of stability that is now crumbling along with other old certainties about the region. It is simple enough, say, to monitor the communications of an armoured division or track a MiG fighter squadron, but far harder to understand the calculations going on in Bashar al-Assad&apos;s head. &quot;Tanks are the easiest thing to follow,&quot; says a veteran intelligence officer in Tel Aviv. Ora Peretz lives in a kibbutz founded when Israel conquered the Golan Heights in 1967 and runs a cafe selling cherries, coffee and cold drinks. &quot;We see terrible things on TV about what is happening in Syria,&quot; she said, as a group of tourists peered across no-man&apos;s land at the ruins of Quneitra. &quot;But it&apos;s quiet here. People say Assad might try to do something desperate. But I know we are ready if he does.&quot; The potential fallout from a disintegrating Syria is not Israel&apos;s only worry. Last month&apos;s election victory for the Muslim Brotherhood&apos;s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt and jitters about unrest in Jordan have raised troubling questions about the country&apos;s peace treaties with two of its immediate neighbours. In Lebanon, the third neighbour, Hezbollah \u2013 armed by Iran and Syria \u2013 is seen as a permanent challenge to Israel&apos;s regional dominance. Israel&apos;s once close relations with Turkey are in ruins. Official discourse in Israel frowns on the romantic phrase &quot;the Arab spring&quot;. The reference point is more Tehran 1979 than Berlin 1989. In government offices the preferred terms are &quot;awakening&quot; or plain &quot;unrest&quot;. Politicians do use a seasonal metaphor, but a far chillier one. &quot;For us it is an Islamist winter,&quot; says Ronnie Bar-On, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee. A colour photograph of Auschwitz above his desk is a bleak reminder of what still makes many Israelis tick. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, likes to describe the Middle East as a &quot;tough neighbourhood&quot;. Ehud Barak, his defence minister, once compared Israel to a &quot;villa in the jungle&quot; \u2013 a phrase that smacked of colonialism and racism. In recent months both have warned of the danger of Iran going nuclear and hinted at a pre-emptive attack to stop it \u2013 and maintain Israel&apos;s atomic supremacy. But developments closer to home are deeply unsettling. Israel&apos;s relations with the Arab world and its strategic position in the Middle East have reached &quot;a new low&quot;, in the words of Itamar Rabinovich, a leading historian of the Middle East and a former ambassador to the US. In Israel&apos;s foreign and defence ministries, officials admit they were taken by surprise by events. Distant Tunisia had been of little interest since Yasser Arafat brought the PLO back from there to Gaza and the West Bank in the wake of the Oslo agreement in 1993. Libya is remote, too. Egypt, the largest Arab state and the first to break ranks and make peace with Israel, is another story. &quot;When Mubarak fell the Arab world was stunned and we were as well,&quot; says a senior official in Jerusalem. Last year, as the world watched the drama of Tahrir Square, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a one-time Labor defence minister, deplored the overthrow of Mubarak and even offered him asylum in Israel. It was proof for Egyptians enraged by their president&apos;s complicity in the Gaza blockade and his silence during the 2009 &quot;Cast Lead&quot; war that the old regime was on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of history. Nervous reactions duly followed. In September, after five Egyptian policemen were killed by Israeli troops pursuing Palestinian gunmen in Sinai, a crowd stormed Israel&apos;s embassy in Cairo and its terrified staff had to be evacuated. &quot;Darkness falls on Egypt,&quot; screamed one Hebrew paper, echoing the biblical 10 plagues, when Morsi beat Mubarak&apos;s former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq to the presidency. Publicly, the government response has been low-key. In private Israel fears that in the longer term the Islamists will strengthen their position in relation to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. For now, Israel&apos;s links with the Egyptian military and mukhabarat security people are still functioning well. No one expects the 1979 peace treaty to be scrapped, if only because it would risk $1.3bn in annual defence support from the US, though there may well be an attempt to renegotiate its military provisions. Egyptian public opinion will now be far harder to ignore. Other problems loom. There is concern about the Sinai peninsula where, the Israelis say, extremist Salafi groups are operating. Attacks on gas pipelines have become routine, as has weapon-smuggling from Sudan and Libya to Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. For Israel&apos;s armed Palestinian enemies, the lawless desert provides useful depth. &quot;When we looked at our overall threat assessment of the region three years ago, Egypt was barely mentioned,&quot; recalls the senior official. &quot;It&apos;s not a threat now, but there are a lot of question marks.&quot; To the east, Jordan is a new source of anxiety. Its 1994 peace treaty with Israel is vital to the western-backed monarchy but has always been unpopular. Over the last turbulent year King Abdullah has faced more problems with the traditionally loyal East Bank tribes than from the restive Palestinians. If Assad falls, tensions are likely to rise in Jordan and its Muslim Brotherhood will be emboldened. That treaty is also safe for now, according to Meir Dagan, the last head of the Mossad and guardian of the special relationship with Amman. Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu&apos;s super-hawkish foreign minister, has gone out of his way to reassure Jordan there is no truth to rumours that Israel is scheming to turn it into an &quot;alternative homeland&quot; for the Palestinians so it can keep hold of the West Bank for good. If all this adds up to an alarming picture, the dangers are different from in the past, say the experts. &quot;In the 1950s and 1960s we Israelis worried about Arab power \u2013 that we might be overwhelmed by them and their Soviet weapons,&quot; says Asher Susser of Tel Aviv University. &quot;Now we face the fallout of Arab weakness.&quot; Last May, for example, on &quot;Nakba&quot; day \u2013 commemorating the loss of Palestine in 1948 \u2013 hundreds of Palestinians marched across the normally strictly controlled Golan border from Quneitra right under the antennae on Mount Avital. It was the first time it had been breached in three decades, a handy diversion for a beleaguered Assad. The possible leakage or theft of Syrian chemical weapons or the emergence of al-Qaida-type terrorism are other headaches. In the defence establishment there is recognition that Israel&apos;s traditional interest in regime stability and the military has been too narrow; that understanding the novelty of Arab &quot;people power&quot; requires a shift in focus. &quot;When the regimes around us were dictatorships to a greater or lesser degree, most of what IDF [Israel Defence Forces] intelligence and Mossad researchers had to do was to focus on the man at the top of the pyramid and the small group of generals, advisers and relatives under him,&quot; wrote Amos Harel, military correspondent of the liberal daily Ha&apos;aretz. &quot;Tahrir Square changed all that. Suddenly the intelligence services are talking about whole nations, public opinion and social networks.&quot; Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Bar Ilan University, believes the Arab spring has pushed Israel deeper into a defensive &quot;bunker mentality&quot; in the face of events it perceives as existential threats rather than as circumstances that have been created partly by itself, especially by continuing to build illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. For 12 years, since the collapse of the Camp David talks and the second intifada, there has been an impasse on the issue at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Netanyahu&apos;s government says it would refuse to negotiate with a Palestinian unity government which includes the Islamists of Hamas, who refuse to abandon armed resistance or formally recognise the Jewish state. The PLO is adamant that it will not talk while settlement activity goes on. The two-state solution to the conflict thus looks less and less likely to be achieved. Mahmoud Abbas&apos;s Palestinian Authority, created under Oslo as a temporary administration, still rules in Ramallah but it has not been immune to the winds of change. Strapped for cash and co-operating closely on security with Israel \u2013 enemies accuse the PLO leader of &quot;collaboration&quot; \u2013 it, too, faces dissent at home. &quot;It would be a mistake to leave the Palestinians out of the picture of the Arab spring,&quot; says Klein. &quot;Israel&apos;s nightmare is that Abbas collapses and Hamas takes over. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he fell. We didn&apos;t think that Assad or Mubarak would lose power either.&quot; No one expects a revived peace process any time soon. &quot;For the foreseeable future,&quot; predicts Shlomo Avineri, former director-general of the foreign ministry, &quot;regardless of what is happening around the region there are not going to be any meaningful Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.&quot; The best hope, say western diplomats, is &quot;muddling through&quot; until after the US presidential election in November, and hope that no new intifada erupts. Part of the price of this long impasse is the fading of the 2002 Arab peace initiative, in which all 21 Arab states \u2013 remarkably in the light of the history of the conflict \u2013 offered full recognition of Israel in return for a just settlement of the Palestinian issue. &quot;The Arab initiative is not really relevant any more,&quot; warns Gilad Sher, a former Israeli negotiator. &quot;No Israeli government ever found it interesting enough to even discuss it. That&apos;s a pity. And now we don&apos;t know who will be sitting in the room. Who will represent Syria, Libya? Who are the representatives of the Palestinians \u2013 the PLO or Hamas?&quot; Many Israeli Jews seem largely indifferent to all this. &quot;The Arab spring is a non-story here,&quot; suggests Tom Segev, a historian and columnist. &quot;Most people think things can go on for ever. Bibi [Netanyahu] has managed to create the impression that there&apos;s no Palestinian partner for peace and that everything is just fine. Israelis tend not to be interested in Arabs as people but as enemies. Sure, people will be pleased when Assad falls, as we were when Saddam went. But it won&apos;t make any difference to the cost of renting an apartment in Tel Aviv.&quot; For some, surveying these historic changes in the region, the lesson is obvious. &quot;In the 1950s and 1960s the message from the Arab world to Israel was clear: &apos;We hate you and we don&apos;t want you here,&apos; &quot; says Tel Aviv university professor Eyal Zisser, Assad&apos;s biographer. &quot;Now the message is: &apos;We hate you and we don&apos;t want you here but you are here and what can we do about it?&apos; It&apos;s not a love story but it is a sort of acceptance and that is important, and Israel should not ignore it. Israel should do something in response and that has to mean movement on the Palestinian question. What makes an Egyptian Arab or a Tunisian Arab? It&apos;s the Palestinian question. Israel needs to send a positive message on this to the Arab masses.&quot; Optimists see opportunities as well as threats. Assad&apos;s fall would be a serious blow to Iran and to Hezbollah, gains that outweigh the old &quot;better the devil you know&quot; argument about stability in Damascus and quiet on the Golan.

Nothing but sand and a few determined shrubs lie between them and distant jagged mountains. This is where two Bedouin smugglers, Mustafa and Mohaned, store hostages and arms. It is the final stop on a highly organised, lucrative and brutal smuggling network that runs from the green hills of Eritrea, through Sudan&apos;s refugee camps to the Egyptian Sinai. In Sinai, human trafficking is a successful subsidiary to the main business: smuggling arms. Haile*, 23, was held in one of these buildings for two weeks in May, along with 60 other Eritreans all hoping to reach Israel but instead held and tortured for ransoms of up to $40,000 (\u00a325,000). &quot;Through a small window we could see another building that we called &apos;the weapons house&apos; because a stream of men would go in empty-handed and leave with weapons,&quot; he said. Like hundreds of thousands before him, Haile fled Eritrea for Sudan to avoid the interminable military service demanded by the regime. &quot;Conditions were terrible. There was an outbreak of disease and many soldiers were dying. I just couldn&apos;t stand it,&quot; he said. But after only two weeks in Shagarab refugee camp, Haile was lured by a Sudanese smuggling gang, known as Rashayda, with an offer of work. He was taken to Khartoum where he was sold to Mustafa and Mohaned, along with sacks of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles.     Eritrea smuggling map Photograph: Graphic    Joe, 28, made the same perilous journey in 2011. He paid smugglers several thousand dollars to take him but like Haile, he was driven in a convoy of white Toyota pickup trucks to the border with Egypt, each packed with 20 Eritrean refugees sitting on top of white flour sacks filled with Kalashnikovs. They were destined for another Sinai smuggler, Abu Mohammad. When the convoy approached the mountains along the Sudanese-Egyptian border, each of the Eritrean men was given a gun from the stash and told to shoot if they met Egyptian soldiers. &quot;They know all Eritreans have been in the army; we all know how to fight,&quot; Joe said. &quot;I wasn&apos;t scared, I felt nothing. Two people had already died from a lack of water on the way. I had given up. We are not humans to the smugglers \u2013 they treat the weapons with more respect.&quot; Others report noticing Eritrean army markings on M14 and Kalashnikov rifles smuggled with them out of Sudan. &quot;I was in the army for nine years \u2013 I know the kind of weapons they use,&quot; said Thomaski Haile, an Eritrean dissident who crossed into Sinai in 2007. &quot;One M14 in my car had Tigrinya symbols and a series of numbers on the side that belonged to the lowest rank in the Eritrean army.&quot; Once inside the Sinai smugglers&apos; camps, only those who can be of service to their captors are spared daily torture, including being hung upside down for hours, rape and burning with electric cables. Their screams are relayed to relatives over the phone, along with demands for money. Woldemariame, 31, who earns a living washing dishes at a Tel Aviv restaurant, was another of those kidnapped by Abu Mohammad. He said he spent a month in Sinai, where, as a fluent Arabic speaker, he worked as a translator for the Bedouin gang and was privy to every aspect of their business. &quot;Abu Mohammad smuggles people from Libya and Sudan to Israel. He also receives deliveries of around 150 weapons three times a week. I saw with my own eyes Abu Mohammad pay $250 each for these weapons, mostly Russian originally. He sells them to Palestinians for more,&quot; Woldemariame said. He described the weapon&apos;s journey, starting at Aalla, a town in Eritrea&apos;s southern hills, to a warehouse in Teseney, on the Sudanese border. From here, two high-ranking Eritrean officers drove them across the border to WadiSerifay refugee camp where they were handed over to the Rashayda, Woldemariame said. According to Woldemariame and the UN monitoring group, one man controls this export industry: General Teklai Kifle &quot;Manjus&quot;, commander of Eritrea&apos;s western military zone. A UN investigator for the Eritrea and Somalia Monitoring Group, said: &quot;A small clique of military and government officials runs the state and Manjus is one of the most influential. With activity on this scale over such a long time you have to assume the knowledge and tacit approval of other parts of the Eritrean leadership. &quot;Their motivation is financial, not just in terms of the personal gain of Manjus but also for the party and party officials. Particularly, given the scale, with regard to human trafficking.&quot; Eritrea denies these charges. The estimated 40,000 Eritreans living in Israel legally cannot be deported because of the dangers they face should they return, but are not granted refugee status. They receive no state support but it is this community that shoulders the burden of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to save the lives of kidnapped relatives. Eritrean refugees in Tel Aviv, many of whom have endured the horrors of the Sinai torture camps, ask why no one \u2013 not Israel, Egypt, the US nor the EU \u2013 will intervene to stop the brutal trade in human lives that is bankrupting their families, or the weapons trade they believe arms militants, including Hamas. Former middleman Woldemariame said Abu Mohammad was able to run his criminal business openly. His base, a huge, off-white villa surrounded by a low wall, is near the UN airbase in Sinai. The arms, he said, are kept in a bamboo shack 100 metres from the house. &quot;The refugees he tortures can see red helicopters landing at the UN base 300 metres away,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m sure you can see his villa from the UN. If they would just go and look, they would find hundreds of weapons.

Last year, tens of thousands participated in the J14 weekly marches against the high cost of living in Israel and the deterioration of social services. The rallies grew week on week, culminating in nationwide demonstrations on September 3 that brought over 400,000 people to the streets. This was the largest \u2013 and most peaceful \u2013 protest against capitalism that summer across the globe, not only percentage-wise (6% of the population) but in absolute numbers as well. There&apos;s a different atmosphere on the streets this summer. Polls show there is still widespread support for J14 (named after the day the protest began, July 14), but fewer are participating. Saturday&apos;s demonstration, the largest so far, managed to muster just 10,000 people. The ad hoc leadership of the movement has splintered into numerous factions, some calling for more co-operation with the political system, while others want a confrontational approach. Both the citizens and the state are losing patience. Police are showing less restraint this time round and videos of protesters being beaten have quickly spread across the social networks. Police even brought in a high-tech military surveillance vehicle used in the occupied territories to monitor protesters. And even before the protests started up again, key activists were summoned for interrogation at police stations. On the protesters&apos; side, the confrontational approach took centre stage a few weeks ago when a bank was &quot;occupied&quot; and its windows smashed. Yet all this changed on Saturday night. Moshe Silman, 57, a son of Holocaust survivors, took a bus from the northern city of Haifa to the protest in Tel Aviv, a bottle of petrol in his hand. Just as the demo was about to end, he doused himself and lit a match. At the time of writing he is in critical condition with third-degree burns covering 94% of his body. Just before setting himself alight, Silman handed out a letter telling his story of how a small debt of around US$1,000 to the National Insurance Institute spiralled out of control. From a man who owned a small truck delivery business, Silman&apos;s battle against Israeli authorities took him through bankruptcy, mental despair, and eventually severe deterioration in health. He suffered a stroke, could not work, and when he asked for minimum assistance in rent, he was turned down. It got so hard for him that friends recall him saying the only time he was at peace was in hospital, where he got three meals a day. Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, used an interesting choice of words, calling Silman&apos;s self-immolation a &quot;personal tragedy&quot;, as if it had nothing to do with the social structure of the state and did not reflect a much larger disease in Israeli society. A &quot;personal tragedy&quot;? The truth is, Silman is just one victim in a country that long ago lost any of its social-democratic values, and now some of its humanity. As Israel&apos;s occupation of Palestine looks increasingly like apartheid, as basic democratic norms are being discarded one by one, Israeli governments over the past three decades have drastically cut back on social rights and services for its citizens inside the green line, as well. Housing, education, employment, welfare \u2013 all have been drained of their resources. Recent data shows that Israel spends only 16% of its GDP on public services, compared to an average of 22% in the OECD, of which it is now a member. The health system is one of the hardest hit, as even Silman himself learned that Saturday, when he could not be admitted to the hospital burn unit because there were only eight beds, all taken. Silman&apos;s case clearly shows that the economic and social problems that brought hundreds of thousands of people to the streets last year remain unresolved. The gaps between rich and poor are some of the highest in the west, with 60% of the wealth being held by only 10% of the public. Indeed, it is difficult to shake the feeling that the gap between the regime and its citizens is only widening. Despite their support for J14, many Israelis consider the movement a failure. Some say that such huge numbers of protesters should have brought about more substantial change, and quicker. Others take issue with J14 demanding &quot;social justice&quot; \u2013 yet avoid the social justice that the Palestinian people long for and deserve. Yet, its greatest success is actually in the slow process that it has set in motion: since Israel&apos;s independence, its political discourse has been completely dominated by military and security issues. Thanks to J14, this is changing. Politicians now spend huge amounts of time discussing it, conglomerates know they are being watched much closer by the public \u2013 and some have even been punished by consumers. For the first time in its history, Israelis may be able to say in the next elections: &quot;It&apos;s the economy, stupid.&quot; Silman is not the Mohamed Bouazizi of Israel, however. The Netanyahu regime will not be brought down by crowds of people storming the Knesset. Yet, his act may make people who have lost faith in J14 come out to the streets again. Essentially, what Silman has shown most middle-class Israelis is that they didn&apos;t know how bad it really is here. How rotten to the core the system has become. He has opened our eyes to the fact that his tragedy is not personal, as Netanyahu would want us to believe.

A group of about 200 mostly young Israelis travelling with the Kavei Chufsha tour company had just flown into the country and were being driven to their hotels in three coaches when the explosion hit one of the vehicles in the Black Sea city of Burgas, 250 miles (400 kilometres) east of the capital, Sofia. The Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, after being briefed by his Bulgarian counterpart, said the explosion had been caused by a bomb placed on the bus. It detonated not far from Burgas airport, said Dimitar Nikolov, the city&apos;s mayor. At least 40 people were on board when it exploded. Barely an hour after the attack, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, issued a veiled threat to Tehran in a statement. He said that once again, &quot;all signs point to Iran&quot;, though he did not offer any evidence to back up the claim. &quot;Iran is responsible for the terror attack in Bulgaria, we will have a strong response against Iranian terror,&quot; he said. The attack comes days after a 24-year-old Lebanese man affiliated with Hezbollah was arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of planning a terror attack targeting Israeli tourists, based on evidence provided to local police by Israeli intelligence. The man was found with information on tour buses carrying Israeli passengers, a list of Cypriot spots favoured by Israeli tourists and details of Israeli airlines that fly into Cyprus, Greek newspaper Phileleftheros reported. &quot;Based on the modus operandi of Hezbollah and Iranian agencies, including the Revolutionary Guard, I think a clear trademark connects today&apos;s attack with those elements,&quot; said Boaz Ganor, executive director at the Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya, Israel. This month&apos;s consecutive attempts \u2013 one thwarted and one successful - on Israeli targets abroadfollows attacks on Israeli diplomatic targets in India, Georgia and Kenya in February. Iran has spoken of its &quot;open war&quot; on Israel. &quot;In February, the same groups were identifiable by their trademarks \u2013 magnetic bombs stuck to the bottom of diplomatic cars. This same method has not necessarily been used in today&apos;s attack, but we are seeing the same technique of simultaneously planned attacks,&quot; said Ganor.&quot;I would definitely not underestimate the threat of further attacks. There may well be terror units in different countries with similar contingency plans to attack Israeli tourists in the near future.&quot; The United States, which has preferred to pursue sanctions and diplomatic pressure against Iran in the nuclear dispute, strongly condemned what President Barack Obama called a &quot;barbaric terrorist attack&quot;, and the British foreign secretary, William Hague, also called it terrorism and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Tehran did not immediately issue any comment. Initial reports claimed the explosion had been caused by a suicide bomber, after witnesses reported seeing someone board the bus before it blew up. Michel Parhan said her daughter Ron had called her in panic from the bus, saying that a man had boarded and blown himself up. &quot;She sustained cuts and was bleeding, they removed her through the window of the bus,&quot; Parhan told Haaretz. &quot;She was hysterical, and is there without a cell phone, so she could not say much.&quot; The Bulgarian interior minister, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, was later quoted on the national radio BNR as saying the police were investigating two possible causes of the blast: that a device was put in the coach before the tourists boarded, or that explosives were in the tourists&apos; luggage. Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, promised that its security services will do all they can to find those responsible for the attack. &quot;We have been tracking the intentions of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Iranian groups and the Islamic Jihad to carry out attacks across the world for quite some time,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a long struggle with them, which includes many successes, as well as difficult days. Today is one of those difficult days. It is important that Israelis continue to travel across the world, continue to travel in Israel and live their normal lives despite all the pain.&quot; Barak said. Bulgarian media reports said an 11-year-old child and two pregnant women were among the injured. Within minutes of the attack, Burgas airport was closed and newly arrived passengers from Israel were not allowed to disembark. Eleven flights from Tel Aviv bound for eastern Europe were also grounded. The Israeli foreign office said Israeli medics had been sent to Bulgaria to assist the injured. As the emergency teams were rallied, Israeli officials focused on those responsible and how the Jewish state should respond.

Security footage from Sarafovo Airport terminal shows the man roaming the airport for more than an hour before Wednesday&apos;s attack, apparently waiting for the Israeli tourists. A badly damaged body was subsequently found at the scene with the US passport and a Michigan drivers license. Five Israelis were killed and 34 injured, three critically, in the blast. Within an hour Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu had laid the blame on Iran. He described the explosion as part of a global war of terror waged by the Islamic republic and its proxy, Hezbollah. He called world leaders asking them to stand with Israel against the &quot;number one state exporter of terrorism.&quot; Shimon Peres, Israel&apos;s president, said that the country would strike out in retaliation at &quot;terror nests&apos;&apos; around the world. &quot;We were witnesses to a deadly terror attack coming out of Iran... we know there were other attempts, and this time they succeeded,&quot; he said. &quot;[Israel] has the means and the will to silence and paralyse terror organisations.&quot; Iran has vehemently denied any involvement in the attack in the Black Sea tourist resort. Tehran issued a statement through its embassy in Bulgaria on Thursday. &quot;The unfounded statements by different statesmen of the Zionist regime in connection with the accusations against Iran about its possible participation in the incident with the blown-up bus with Israeli tourists in Burgas is a familiar method of the Zionist regime, with a political aim, and is a sign of the weakness... of the accusers,&quot; it read. The attack took place soon after the Israelis boarded a bus outside the airport in Burgas, a popular destination for Israeli tourists. Bulgarian television showed footage from the airport of the suspected bomber wandering in and out of the terminal shortly before the blast, dressed as a tourist in a baseball cap, T-shirt, plaid shorts and trainers with short white socks and carrying a large backpack with wheels. Officials said the bomb went off in the luggage compartment of the bus as the attacker mingled among his victims. Bulgarian interior minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said the bomber was believed to have been about 36 years old and had been in the country between four and seven days. &quot;We cannot exclude the possibility that he had logistical support on Bulgarian territory,&quot; the minister said. He declined to elaborate. Officials are using DNA samples to try to establish his identity. Bulgarian prime minister Boiko Borisov told reporters that a Michigan driver&apos;s licence was retrieved from the scene, but he said US officials reported that &quot;there was no such person in their database.&quot; The Israelis had arrived on a charter flight from Tel Aviv carrying 154 people, including eight children. Survivors told Israeli television that they had been boarding the white bus in the airport parking lot to ride to their hotel when the blast occurred. Israel&apos;s military said a military plane carrying 33 Israelis injured in the bombing arrived in Israel on Thursday. At least two critically injured Israelis were sent to Sofia for treatment, according to the head of the Israeli military medical corps, Brigadier General Itzik Kreis. A Bulgarian government plane will fly home 100 other uninjured Israelis who want to cut short their vacation. Bulgarian authorities on Thursday dispatched 200 police to hotels where about 1,000 Israelis were staying just north of Burgas. A representative of the Ortanna tour company said about 10,000 Israelis had booked vacations in Bulgaria through the firm this summer and about half had cancelled after the attack. Israeli leaders say the attack bore the fingerprints of a combined Iranian and Hezbollah operation, comparing it to a recently thwarted attack by a Hezbollah operative in Cyprus and a series of simultaneous attempted bomb attacks on Israeli diplomatic targets in February. In February, Israel responded with restraint. Today, Jerusalem&apos;s rhetoric promises retribution.&quot;We hurt Imad Mughniyah a few years ago and mostly we are in a battle against Iran,&quot; Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser told Israeli Army Radio. He was referring to the alleged Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leader Mughniyah, who died in a mysterious explosion in Damascus in 2008. The suicide attack in Bulgaria coincided with the 18th anniversary of the 1994 bombing of the Jewish Centre in Buenos Aires, an attack masterminded by Mughniyah in which 85 people were killed and hundreds injured. The coincidence will not have been lost on the Israeli leadership. Yoram Schweitzer, a senior analyst at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, backed Netanyahu&apos;s accusation of Iran. &quot;We are still in the initial stages of the aftermath of the attack. But when I hear the prime minister of Israel solidifying a statement such as this, it must be based on solid intelligence,&quot; he said. The attack comes as fighting has escalated in Syria, threatening destabilisation across the Middle East. Addressing reporters in the Golan Heights on Thursday, just miles from Syria, Ehud Barak said that Israel would act to prevent &apos;waves of Syrian refugees&apos; entering the country. &quot;We obviously are not the only player in the region that is anxious \u2026 about the fact that an anarchic situation will bring about the transfer of sensitive systems into the wrong hands,&quot; Barak explained. &quot;There is no small amount of chemical weapons dispersed all around the country and there is a lot of weaponry in the hands of the civilians. The rebel forces started attacking and taking over military bases and are seizing weapons for their own use.&quot; IBurgas airport was closed on Thursday. In Sofia, mayor Yordanka Fandakova ordered a stronger police presence at all public places linked to the Jewish community. Some 5,000 Jews live in Bulgaria, most in Sofia. As reports emerged on Thursday that Bashar al-Assad and his wife had fled their base in Damascus, the IDF reacted with anxiety. Commando police units and ambulances were placed on alert along the country&apos;s northern border. Lebanese media reported that Israeli fighter planes were conducting mock raids over Marjayoun near its southern border with the Jewish state. Uzi Rabi, director of the Dayan Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University, conceded that Israel&apos;s position was precarious. &quot;Syria as a failed state poses a great threat.

We lost the Sunday Times&apos; legendary war correspondent Marie Colvin \u2013 her injured colleague, in a recent Vanity Fair piece, believes they may have been targeted after she appeared reporting from Syria on the BBC. William Dobson&apos;s new book, The Dictator&apos;s Learning Curve: Inside the Global Battle for Democracy, explains that autocrats and anti-democracy forces around the world are learning how to be nimbler and more efficient in suppressing populations, and one way to do this is control of news reporting in spots where abuses are taking place. If you scan the reporting of Reporters Without Borders (and the examples they investigate of harassment, imprisonment and other assaults on journalists worldwide are extensive), you see subtle new patterns developing: in Jordan, for instance, a new law criminalizes with penalties as severe as hard labor such vaguely defined crimes as offending public decency, or any reporting that threatens &quot;national security&quot; or &quot;public order&quot;. Reporters Without Borders concludes that this type of soft coercion chills investigative reporting. On the other side of the autocrats&apos; toolbox of repression, there are regimes that don&apos;t bother with new laws because they just keep foreign journalists out or mow domestic reporters down: Bahrain&apos;s massacres, like Syria&apos;s, RWB asserts, are proceeding without check because they are out of range of cameras. This is one major reason the world is becoming more dangerous for news reporters \u2013 who used to be protected by an unspoken convention that they were above the conflict. A turning-point in this newly hostile targeting of journalists was reached when Donald Rumsfeld began demonizing al-Jazeera. As many journalists believe, reporters and cameramen covering the Iraq war who were based in the Palestine Hotel were deliberately targeted, causing injury and death. We have reports that, in the first half of this year alone, 29 journalists have been killed, and 161 imprisoned, with comparable numbers for netizens and citizen journalists affected. The same defense of reporting organization notes that Ecuador&apos;s President Rafael Correa has begun to attack journalists personally \u2013 always a harbinger of danger to reporters \u2013 in addition to closing 17 news outlets that have been critical of the government. Which is why Sherine Tadros&apos; and Ayman Mohyeldin&apos;s new film, The War Around Us, is so extraordinary. It tells the story of people imprisoned and helpless to escape as bombs began falling \u2013 and it is also a narrative with the old-fashioned trope of war correspondent as hero. Neither of these reporters had to choose lives in which they faced such danger and privation. Both are children of some privilege: Tadros was raised in London, and has two degrees in politics. Mohyeldin&apos;s Egyptian-Palestinian family lives in the west now; he was educated at the American University in Washington, DC, and was hired by CNN and other networks. The two chose al-Jazeera at a key point in their careers because both felt a mission to bring the voices of the voiceless in the Middle East to the attention of the rest of the world. When Mohyeldin was stationed in Gaza in 2008, and Tadros was sent there to help produce his segments for what she thought was a day, but turned out to be a dangerous three weeks, their lives were changed. As the conflict started, most foreign journalists were recalled, reporting &quot;on Gaza&quot; from the relative safety of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Cairo. Mohyeldin and Tadros were the last reporters to stay in Gaza. Because they chose to stay, and finally had no safe way out, the world now has footage of what that bombardment actually looked like from the point of view of the Gazan citizens under attack. Tadros believes the western media tends to stereotype Gazans:  &quot;People tend to think of Gaza as this far-flung place: they are all terrorists, or hardline Islamists. All we were trying to do was humanize what was going on.&quot;  The bombardment&apos;s intensity made the reporters believe at first that it couldn&apos;t go on more than a day, as more Gazans died in the first day of the attack than ever had before in one day. But it did. Mohyeldin notes:  &quot;Not only could you not imagine that the unleashing of that kind of damage could continue, but you could not imagine that the world would stand by and stay silent.&quot;  Mohyeldin and Tadros are the unlikely faces of this kind of conflict journalism: both young and telegenic. Tadros is still with al-Jazeera, while Mohyeldin, who reported live for al-Jazeera from Tahrir Square, has been hired by NBC. But that celebrity spin, where journalism is firmly headed, is not what defines these reporters. That old-fashioned, dangerous and crucial mission \u2013 to stay and tell the story where everyone else who could be a witness for the world has fled \u2013 is what defines them. Conflict zones are growing in complexity. According to Mexican journalists I interviewed in February, the government stands by, apparently unconcerned, as their colleagues are mown down by cartels who don&apos;t want to be reported upon. In the absence of effective state protection, Mexican journalists are asking for international action on their behalf. What might that look like? The means of recourse we have now are too slight: Reporters Without Borders maintains two desks and administers legal aid money for reporters in trouble; promotes petitions and supports families of reporters in jail. But it may need the greater clout of a global organization, acting perhaps as an adjunct to existing regional ones, to pressure governments through diplomacy and perhaps even with a mix of economic incentives and sanctions.

Moshe Silman suffered 94% burns to his body after dousing himself with petrol and setting himself on fire as a protest over the high cost of living in Israel drew to a close.  His death on Friday afternoon was expected. Hours after he was admitted last week, doctors at the Sheba medical centre in Tel Hashomer had warned relatives that his chances of survival were slim. On Friday morning, he was given just hours to live. Despite the tragedy of his death, friends and fellow activists insisted that Silman would not have regretted his final act of protest. &quot;There was protest in his soul,&quot; said one friend, who had attended rallies with Silman in Haifa, the port town where he lived. &quot;He waited for it to break out and was glad when it did,&quot; the friend added. Leaders of the popular movement, active since the &quot;tent protests&quot; of last summer, have stressed that they do not support or condone self-immolation. However, Silman&apos;s relatives and friends expressed little surprised that he ended his life with such a dramatic act. The details that have emerged of Silman&apos;s private life since his self-immolation have indicated a troubled existence. The son of Holocaust survivors, he never married and had no children, which is why his requests for public housing were denied repeatedly. Having earned a living from odd jobs, he set up a messenger service in 2000, which failed during the unrest of the second intifada. Two years ago, unable to afford the cost of living in Tel Aviv, he moved to Haifa where he became deeply involved in the social protest movement. Despite receiving state support for disabilities resulting from a stroke, he had become unable to pay his medical bills and rent. Silman&apos;s sister Elul said that her brother was in despair. &quot;He was mired in debt. Until the last moment we helped him but he didn&apos;t want it. Since the day he lost everything, the day they took everything \u2013 the house, his trucks, the money, my parents&apos; house \u2013 he has been going downhill,&quot; she said. In the suicide note he distributed shortly before setting himself alight, Silman blamed Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and the finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, for his actions. &quot;I refuse to be homeless, this is why I am protesting,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Against all the injustices done to me by the state, me and others like me.&quot; Thousands protested last Sunday in solidarity with Silman, angry that he had been driven to such desperation. It remains to be seen whether his death will invigorate the protests that have failed to garner the popular support of last year, when almost half a million Israelis took to the streets to demand social change.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T16:28:49Z", "title": "Israeli protester who set himself alight dies in hospital", "sentences": ["A 57-year-old Israeli protester who set himself alight at a demonstration in Tel Aviv last Saturday has died from his injuries.", "Two years ago, unable to afford the cost of living in Tel Aviv, he moved to Haifa where he became deeply involved in the social protest movement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/20/israeli-protester-alight-dies"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Communities", "Society"], "article": "After decades of declining numbers, bankruptcies and privatisation, Israel&apos;s kibbutz movement is undergoing a remarkable revival, with rising numbers wanting to join the unique form of collective living. The population of about 143,000 is the highest in its 102-year history, after growth of 20% between 2005 and 2010, according to the official Kibbutz Movement. More people are now joining kibbutzim than leaving \u2013 a reversal of the crisis years \u2013 and the influx of working-age adults and young children is helping to redress the balance of an ageing population. Most kibbutzim have implemented reforms to become commercially viable and stem decline. Liberalisation \u2013 including permitting differential incomes and home ownership \u2013 has increased their attractiveness to newcomers reluctant to commit to pure communal principles. Only about 60 of Israel&apos;s 275 kibbutzim still operate a completely collective model, in which all members are paid the same regardless of their allotted job. Most of the rest have introduced wage differentials for people employed by the kibbutz \u2013 but, more importantly, many members now work outside the kibbutz and contribute a proportion of their salaries to the collective. Other measures have included selling kibbutz businesses, charging for meals and services, and recruiting agricultural labourers from south-east Asia. The changes, necessary for survival, have been painful, particularly for a generation of kibbutz pioneers wedded to a socialist-Zionist dream. Increasing numbers of families are attracted to kibbutz living by the quality of education, environment, space and security. But, according to Amikam Osem, a member of Kibbutz Afikim near the Sea of Galilee for 50 years after marrying a kibbutznik, the most important reason was a sense of community. &quot;This is the principle of kibbutz life \u2013 mutual help and responsibility for each other.&quot; A kibbutz, he said, was like an orchestra with people playing different parts &quot;but together we create something meaningful&quot;.     Amikam Osem, who has lived at Kibbutz Afikim for 50 years.    In the last two years, Afikim&apos;s membership has increased from 500 to 600, and there is now a waiting list of people wanting to join. Many are the children of members, wishing to raise their own families in a co-operative environment. Others have never previously lived on a kibbutz. Afikim operates a progressive taxation system: the more you earn, the more you pay into the collective fund. There is a &quot;safety net&quot; minimum income for all, and the kibbutz subsidises healthcare, education, social needs and care for the elderly. The kibbutz owns and runs several successful businesses, plus dairy and fish farms, and grows dates, bananas, avocados and olives on its land. The heavily subsidised dining room \u2013 the heart of the kibbutz \u2013 is open every day for lunch, and twice a week in the evenings. Before being accepted as members with full voting rights, candidates rent homes on the kibbutz. Most members now own their own homes, which can be bequeathed to their children or sold back to the collective. Occasionally a candidate family decides that kibbutz life is not for them; sometimes the kibbutz admissions committee rejects candidates as unsuitable. &quot;Now we could double the size of the kibbutz if we wanted to,&quot; said Yaniv Osem, 50, Amikam&apos;s son and the elected head of the kibbutz. &quot;But we need to be careful.&quot; Those with criminal records, a history of financial mismanagement or antisocial behaviour were not invited to join. There was no bar on unconventional family units, including same-sex couples, he said. &quot;It&apos;s like an excellent country club, but with a safety net. It&apos;s the most secure place in the world.&quot; &quot;Here in the kibbutz, we&apos;re not neighbours \u2013 we&apos;re partners,&quot; said his father. &quot;The kibbutz movement is in a process of change in which there are many different directions. But the thing that unites all kibbutzim is mutual responsibility.&quot; Between forkfuls of subsidised salad at a window table in the vast dining room, Vered Ofir, 45, a fitness instructor and mother of four, reflected on her family&apos;s decision to embrace communal living.     Vered Ofir, 45, whose family became members of Kibbutz Afikim last year.    &quot;It was a big change for us, it took a while to adjust. But we wanted to live in a community, among friends,&quot; she said. The standard of education attracted her, plus the fact that &quot;the babies had a great place to be while I was at work&quot;. But, she added: &quot;Not everything is easy. Sometimes everything is too close; our business is everyone&apos;s business.&quot; After three years of mutual sizing-up to see if the family and the kibbutz were a good fit, the Ofirs became full members of Afikim last year. A few weeks ago, Ofir&apos;s parents arrived with the hope of joining the community. For Ofir, who was born and lived most of her life in Tel Aviv, mutualism outweighs the drawbacks of kibbutz life. &quot;Cities can be very lonely places. Here I have my own life, I work outside the kibbutz, but there is a community. It&apos;s a very positive thing.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-07-23T18:03:00Z", "title": "Israel's kibbutz movement makes a comeback", "sentences": ["For Ofir, who was born and lived most of her life in Tel Aviv, mutualism outweighs the drawbacks of kibbutz life."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/23/israel-kibbutz-movement-comeback"}, {"tags": ["Apps", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Mobile phones", "iPhone", "iPad", "Android", "Windows Phone", "Media", "Technology", "United Nations", "Refugees", "Sky News", "Sky plc"], "article": "A selection of 11 new and notable apps for you today: My Life as a Refugee A game about being a refugee?

Moussa Konat\u00e9&apos;s goal eight minutes from time punctured an otherwise uplifting evening for Stuart Pearce and the nation&apos;s commitment to Olympic football but it was a pertinent reminder of the level required to win gold. Any notions of half-hearted commitment to the Olympic ideal from highly paid professionals were dispelled as Senegal provided a bruising welcome to the competition for Team GB. Having opened the scoring Craig Bellamy was victim of a horrendous foul from Saliou Ciss that should have brought a penalty and could have resulted in a red card. In keeping with a lenient night from the match officials, Senegal were awarded a goal-kick. A m\u00eal\u00e9e followed as Team GB reacted furiously to the challenge, understandably, but more pain was to come as Sadio Man\u00e9 slipped Konat\u00e9 through too easily for the Maccabi Tel Aviv forward to level with a cool chip over Jack Butland. The striker was allowed to roam free unchallenged by Team GB&apos;s defence, Pearce&apos;s team visibly tiring as the night wore on and after less than three weeks&apos; training. There has been cynicism surrounding Team GB&apos;s entry into Olympic football competition, blended with suspicion and fear as national associations seek to protect their separate identities but, at Old Trafford at least, that was outweighed by fierce backing for Pearce&apos;s team. The stadium had filled steadily throughout Uruguay&apos;s unconvincing defeat of United Arab Emirates \u2013 a performance by the South Americans that can only have fuelled British optimism of progression to the knock-out phase \u2013 and a sell-out, high-pitched crowd greeted the nation&apos;s entry on to such a stage for the first time since the Rome Olympics in 1960. Pearce has had little time and one friendly to fuse his 18-man squad and the lack of preparation \u2013 a point disputed by the coach \u2013 told in Friday&apos;s 2-0 defeat against the tournament favourites Brazil at The Riverside Stadium. Team GB produced only one shot of note in Middlesbrough, from Bellamy, but were ahead against a strong and dangerous Senegal side with 20 minutes gone in Manchester courtesy of the Wales international. Bellamy&apos;s fellow Welsh veteran, the captain Ryan Giggs, swung over a trademark free-kick from the right. Daniel Sturridge, far more effective deployed as a central striker than out wide, challenged in the area and, when the ball dropped kindly for the Liverpool forward, he found the far corner convincingly. The emotion with which the 33-year-old reacted to the goal illustrated how much the prize of a gold medal means to these players. The goalscorer was in effervescent form, sprinting after every cause and demanding total commitment from those around him. He was not disappointed, although Team GB did not require instructions from Bellamy to appreciate the intensity of the occasion as Neil Taylor, Daniel Sturridge and Ryan Bertrand found themselves on the receiving end of several dangerous challenges from Senegal. The Olympian spirit was evident only in the leniency of the referee. Team GB performed with a cohesion and quality lacking against Brazil for much of the game but Senegal were not just threatening in the tackle and should have levelled before the interval. The impressive Tottenham Hotspur centre-half Steven Caulker thwarted a fine run across goal from Man\u00e9, who then squandered a gift to equalise when Butland sliced a clearance into his path. The Metz forward controlled on his chest, advanced and chipped the advancing Butland. Fortunately for the Birmingham City keeper, Man\u00e9 is no Andrea Pirlo and his nonchalant clip sailed several feet wide. Whether it was the familiar surroundings, responsibility to younger players or simply his enduring excellence, Giggs was instrumental in Team GB&apos;s control of midfield in the first half. A quick, inch-perfect free-kick from the centre circle almost produced the team&apos;s second when he released Sturridge over a dawdling defence but the shot from a tight angle flashed wide. The Chelsea striker did not reappear for the second half, Bolton Wanderers&apos; Marvin Sordell took his place and the host nation were clearly aggrieved at the recklessness of some Senegal challenges. Bellamy conducted a lengthy inquest with Ravshan Irmatov, the Uzbekistan referee, as they walked out for the second half and their conversation resumed within a minute of the restart, the striker booked for leading with an arm into an aerial duel with Ciss. Butland redeemed himself with a smart stop from Ibrahima Bald\u00e9&apos;s shot on the turn and was increasingly the busier keeper as Senegal improved and Team GB faded after the interval. Ciss almost avenged Bellamy&apos;s foul in the finest way by cutting inside him to release a swerving shot that Butland theatrically pushed over. From the subsequent corner Abdoulaye Ba escaped his marker and turned a powerful header goalwards only for the well-stationed Danny Rose to clear the ball off the line. Rose and Taylor both suffered from Senegal&apos;s fondness for leaving a foot in while Joe Allen, part of a well-balanced midfield three alongside Giggs and Tom Cleverley, limped off midway through the second half with a knee injury. Bellamy was fortunate not to accompany his compatriot down the tunnel on a stretcher. Instead he left to a standing ovation and with a furious word into the eye of an official.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-26T23:27:00Z", "title": "London 2012: Team GB 1-1 Senegal | Olympic men's football Group A", "sentences": ["A m\u00eal\u00e9e followed as Team GB reacted furiously to the challenge, understandably, but more pain was to come as Sadio Man\u00e9 slipped Konat\u00e9 through too easily for the Maccabi Tel Aviv forward to level with a cool chip over Jack Butland."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-team-gb-senegal"}, {"tags": ["Morrissey", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "The Smiths were curiously absent from\u00a0Danny Boyle&apos;s Olympic ceremony\u00a0celebration of British musical heritage. &quot;I wasn&apos;t invited,&quot; explains their former frontman, archly. &quot;That\u00a0was\u00a0because my smile was judged\u00a0to be too sincere.&quot; Moments later, Morrissey moans that while he enjoys the freedom of Tel Aviv, the authorities in his hometown have given\u00a0him &quot;nothing.

The presumptive Republican candidate in the the US presidential race told a $25,000-a-head (\u00a316,000) fundraising event in Jerusalem: &quot;As I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognise the power of at least culture and a few other things.&quot; He cited a climate of innovation, the Jewish history of thriving in adversity, and the &quot;hand of providence&quot;.

He also lacks knowledge about the Israelis themselves. I have not heard any Israeli official speak about cultural superiority.&quot; Romney, who did not visit the West Bank while in the Holy Land, made no mention of either Israel&apos;s 45-year occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, nor its continuing blockade of Gaza, both of which have had a catastrophic impact on the Palestinian economy. The consensus of international economists, including the IMF and the World Bank, is that the Palestinian economy will fail to develop firm foundations and sustained growth until Israeli restrictions on imports, exports and the movement of goods are lifted. Romney&apos;s comparison between the Israeli and Palestinian economies drew on figures substantially different from those cited by the World Bank. Romney said: &quot;As you come here and you see the [gross domestic product] per capita, for instance, in Israel, which is about $21,000, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.&quot; According to the World Bank, however, Israel&apos;s per-capita GDP was about $31,000 in 2011, while the West Bank and Gaza&apos;s was just over $1,500. More than 40 people attended Romney&apos;s fundraising breakfast at Jerusalem&apos;s famous King David hotel, amassing more than $1m for the Republican election campaign. The event was moved from Sunday after Romney aides realised it had been scheduled during Tisha B&apos;Av, a Jewish day of mourning and fasting. Sheldon Adelson, the Jewish-American billionaire casino magnate who has bankrolled Romney&apos;s presidential campaign, sat next to the candidate at a U-shaped table. Adelson also owns Israel Hayom, the Jewish state&apos;s biggest-circulation newspaper, which is a staunch supporter of Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s government. Among the other guests were the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, and the hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Donors ate a typical Israeli breakfast of salad, cheese, yoghurt and pastries. Romney, who introduced his eldest son, Josh, to the gathering, said he had &quot;read a number of books&quot; on what makes countries successful. He added: &quot;I am overwhelmingly impressed with the hand of providence, whenever it chooses to apply itself, and also the greatness of the human spirit, and how individuals who reach for greatness and have purpose above themselves are able to build and accomplish things that could only be done by a species created in the image of God.&quot; During a speech on Sunday delivered against the backdrop of the historic old city at sunset, Romney described Jerusalem as &quot;the capital of Israel&quot;.

A second senior Palestinian official, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said the statement was unhelpful to peace negotiations, pointing out it &quot;contradict[ed] the previous positions held by the American administration&quot;. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967 and later annexed by Israel in a move not recognised by the international community. The future of Jerusalem is one of the most complex and delicate issues in negotiations on a possible peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. All foreign embassies, including that of the US, are in Tel Aviv, with consular services based in Jerusalem. In a statement, the White House stated official policy: &quot;The status of Jerusalem is an issue that should be resolved in final status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. We continue to work with the parties to resolve this issue and others in a way that is just and fair, and respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-07-30T16:51:00Z", "title": "Mitt Romney 'providence' comments in Israel outrage Palestinians", "sentences": ["All foreign embassies, including that of the US, are in Tel Aviv, with consular services based in Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/30/mitt-romney-israel-economic-success"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Leon Panetta", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "US news"], "article": "     Leon Panetta, the US defence secretary, is meeting political leaders and security officials in Israel, as the country&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, insisted he would take a decision about whether or when to attack Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities amid reports that the Israeli military is opposed to such a move. In a series of television interviews as Panetta arrived in Tel Aviv from Egypt, Netanyahu said Israel had the right to defend itself. &quot;Things that affect our fate, our very existence, we don&apos;t entrust to others \u2013 not even to our best friends,&quot; he said. Following media reports that senior defence officials, including military chief of staff Benny Gantz and Mossad chief Tamar Pardo, are opposed to early unilateral action, the prime minister said any decision would be taken by the country&apos;s political leadership. But he added: &quot;I have not taken a decision.&quot; &quot;In every democracy the decision-maker is the political echelon and the implementer is the professional echelon,&quot; he said. &quot;That is how it always was and that is how it always will be.&quot; Referring to former prime minister Menachem Begin&apos;s decision in 1981 to bomb a nuclear reactor in Iraq against the advice of security officials, Netanyahu said: &quot;It was obvious that the political echelon makes the decisions because it both sees the big picture and shoulders ultimate responsibility. The principle remains the same.&quot; Gantz denied he was behind the media reports, saying: &quot;I tell the political echelon what I have to say, and they listen.&quot; The Israeli military was prepared for a military strike, he said. &quot;As we see it, &apos;all options are on the table&apos; is not a slogan, it is a working plan and we are doing it.&quot; After a period in which speculation over whether Israel would strike Iran&apos;s nuclear sites in the coming months quietened, the question has returned to the fore. There have been fresh reports of a split between the political and security establishments over the merits of early unilateral action, following open opposition to such a move from former security chiefs. There is also some speculation that Israel may choose to act ahead of the US elections in early November, especially if Barack Obama&apos;s chances of re-election are strengthened. Panetta&apos;s visit \u2013 he is the fourth senior US administration official to visit Israel in the past few weeks \u2013 follows that of presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who pledged the US &quot;will not look away&quot; in the face of an existential threat to Israel from Iran. A senior Romney aide suggested that Romney would back unilateral action taken by Israel. Panetta denied that he would share with Israeli officials US contingency plans to attack Iran if sanctions and diplomacy failed to halt the Islamic Republic&apos;s nuclear programme in an attempt to dissuade Israel from acting alone. &quot;I think it&apos;s a wrong characterisation to say we are going to be discussing potential attack plans. What we are discussing are various contingencies and how we would respond,&quot; he said at a press conference in Cairo before leaving for Israel. The defence secretary is meeting his counterpart, Ehud Barak, as well as Netanyahu. He will tour an Iron Dome battery, which Israel deploys against rockets and missiles fired from the Gaza Strip. Panetta said on Monday that international sanctions against Iran were having &quot;a serious impact in terms of the economy in Iran.

The loveable touchline-hugger is believed to be a bit miffed, bearing in mind his imminent free-agentness, that his current employers are yet to knock on his door bearing a new contract, and a Paris-bound strop cannot therefore be ruled out. Talking of miffed, Italian giants Juventus are reported to be feeling similarly out of sorts at the absence of Robin van Persie from their playing roster, despite the offer of a five-year \u00a3190,000-a-week contract for the striker and an exceedingly large dump-truck of cash for Arsenal. They are now stamping their feet and demanding an answer within a week, otherwise they will scream very, very loudly. Perhaps the reason Chelsea haven&apos;t been giving Ashley Cole enough attention is that they&apos;re busy concentrating on the Marseille ace C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. The Blues have followed an unsuccessful offer of \u00a35.4m with an improved bid of \u00a37m for the full-back, but the French club want \u00a38.5m before they let the player go. Tottenham have \u00a310m and they&apos;re going to use it. More specifically, they&apos;re going to use it to sign M\u00e1laga striker Salomon Rondon, who could join his team-mate Santi Cazorla \u2013 so close to sealing his \u00a317m move to Arsenal he may actually already have sealed it \u2013 on the flight to Heathrow.

Possibly heading the other way is Alex Song, who has emerged as a \u00a316m target for Barcelona, though the Spaniards will drop their interest if a move for Athletic Bilbao&apos;s Javi Mart\u00ednez goes through. Levante striker Arouna &quot;Ice Cream&quot; Kon\u00e9 is desperate to move to the Premier League and Fulham are desperate to sign him.

There is &quot;growing concern&quot; in the UK over lack of progress towards peace with the Palestinians, and Israel was now being seen as Goliath against the Palestinians as David, said Matthew Gould, in reference to the biblical story. In an unusually forthright interview for Israel&apos;s Channel 10 news, Gould said he detected a shift among the middle ground of British members of parliament towards a more critical view of Israel. &quot;Israelis might wake up in 10 years&apos; time and find out that the level of understanding in the international community has suddenly changed, and that patience for continuing the status quo has reduced,&quot; he said. &quot;Support for Israel is starting to erode and that&apos;s not about these people on the fringe who are shouting loudly and calling for boycotts and all the rest of it. The interesting category are those members of parliament in the middle, and in that group I see a shift.&quot; But, he added, Britain was &quot;by no means unique&quot; in its growing concern about the lack of progress towards peace. &quot;Anyone who cares about Israel&apos;s standing in the world should be concerned about the erosion of popular support.&quot; The shift was a result of Israeli government policies, Gould said, suggesting that it could not be countered or obscured by hasbara. The Hebrew word for explanation refers to efforts by the Israeli government and its supporters to promote a pro-Israel agenda and challenge what it sees as negative media coverage. &quot;The centre ground, the majority, the British public may not be expert, but they are not stupid and they see a stream of announcements about new building in settlements, they read stories about what&apos;s going on in the West Bank, they read about restrictions in Gaza. The substance of what&apos;s going wrong is really what&apos;s driving this,&quot; Gould said. He added: &quot;Israel is now seen as the Goliath and it&apos;s the Palestinians who are seen as the David.&quot; In the biblical story of David and Goliath, the young future king of Israel defeats the mighty Philistine warrior armed only with a sling and stones. Yigal Palmor, spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry, said: &quot;The feelings of friendship among Israelis towards the British and Britain in general are as strong as they have always been. It makes us sad to hear the ambassador talking about a growing asymmetry. But diplomats don&apos;t just make comments, they convey messages. We have taken good note.&quot; Dermot Kehoe, the chief executive of Bicom, an organisation that promotes Israel in the UK, said: &quot;The Britain/Israel relationship has never been stronger in terms of trade, technology and security cooperation. Our polling shows the relationship is not eroding. &quot;The ambassador is right to highlight the importance of the peace process to the British public. However, Israel is not Goliath. It is a small country surrounded by threats from Iran to Hezbollah to Hamas. The Palestinians also share responsibilities to return to the negotiating table in the search for a lasting peace.&quot; An Israeli official dismissed the David and Goliath allusion, saying it &quot;does not describe anything near reality. It&apos;s a dishonest attempt to take a biblical myth and turn it upside down to make Israel look bad in Jewish terminology.&quot; In the past 30 years, he added, there had been other attempts, particularly by the Palestinians, &quot;to dispossess Jews of our history&quot;. The British embassy in Tel Aviv declined to comment on the interview. At 40, Gould is the first Jewish person to serve as British ambassador to Israel. He said in an interview to mark his arrival in Israel in 2010 that being Jewish gave him &quot;a visceral understanding of why Israel is so fixated on its own security and why security and peace mean so much to Israel and why it&apos;s a country which feels so keenly that it lives on the knife edge&quot;. He previously held posts in Tehran, Washington and Downing Street. A second high-profile British diplomat last month said that the prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians were diminishing. In an article for Prospect, Tom Phillips, who was Gould&apos;s predecessor as ambassador to Israel, said both sides and the international community were responsible for &quot;the chances of a solution to the long-running conflict [growing] bleaker&quot;. Phillips, who recently retired after a stint as ambassador to Saudi Arabia, wrote: &quot;This is the most complex conflict I know. And it may already be too late to achieve a two-state solution, even if that would have been the right solution, and the only possible solution.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T11:51:12Z", "title": "Israel losing international support, says British ambassador", "sentences": ["The British embassy in Tel Aviv declined to comment on the interview."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/israel-losing-international-support-british-ambassador"}, {"tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Israel", "Olympic Games"], "article": "It&apos;s the soundtrack to Tel Aviv beach life: an incessant thwack-thwack-thwack heard over the rhythmic rush of waves and the tinny beat of a thousand iPods. Matkot \u2013 known to most of the rest of the world as bat-and-ball \u2013 is Israel&apos;s unofficial national sport. If it was played at the Olympics, Israel ought to be gold medallists. Athletes would well up in their speedos and thongs as the blue and white flag was raised and the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva, echoed across the Olympic Stadium. But it&apos;s hard to envisage a game that has no rules, score, winners or losers finding a place in the world&apos;s supreme sports competition. And, in any case, some of those on the water&apos;s edge, as a vivid orange sun sank towards the Mediterranean one evening last week, felt proprietorial. &quot;The second that matkot became an Olympic game, other countries would take it seriously,&quot; said Gal Agar, 22. &quot;The Chinese would move in, then we&apos;d be pushed out. We&apos;re only good as long as we&apos;re amateurs.&quot; It&apos;s somewhat unexpected to find Israel among the also-rans on the world stage. For a small, new country \u2013 roughly the size of Wales, with a population of less than eight million, and only 64 years old \u2013 Israel usually punches above its weight in the international arena. Not at the Olympics, where only one of Israel&apos;s 37 athletes \u2013 the windsurfer Lee Korzits \u2013 stands a chance of winning a medal. In Mike&apos;s Place, a beachfront sports bar at which three Israelis were killed in a bombing carried out by a pair of British Muslims in 2003, Jacob Fiddler was phlegmatic. &quot;Everyone around here has their own team,&quot; he said, referring to a largely anglophone clientele. &quot;When it comes to sport, the US is my country,&quot; said the 25-year-old barman who emigrated to Israel from Chicago six years ago. In a nation of first, second or third generation immigrants, it&apos;s not so hard for sports fans to revert to their &quot;home&quot; country. Another option is to support Jewish athletes from other nations. Israel&apos;s media celebrated the success of Aly Raisman, an American Jewish floor gymnast who executed her floor routine to the Hebrew folk tune Hava Nagila last week, as one of their own. But the question of why Israel fails to make a mark at the Olympics remains. &quot;We are very far from being a superpower in sports,&quot; said one Israeli government official. &quot;We rejoice in the odd swimmer that makes it into the final, the poor man&apos;s triumph. It&apos;s not that we can&apos;t compete with the greatest nations \u2013 we are struggling even against the modest ones.&quot; Even relatively recent waves of immigration to Israel from Russia and Ethiopia had failed to produced world-class athletes, he said. &quot;Our people are forced to choose their heroes among the athletes of other nations.&quot; Some attribute this shortcoming to a lack of investment in sport and hothouse training of potential champions. &quot;We have other needs and priorities&quot;, said Jeremy, 33, who emigrated to Israel from the US more than 20 years ago. &quot;And we don&apos;t have a lot of people to choose from. The Olympics is an uphill struggle for us.&quot; Another theory was that the socialist-Zionist ideal, embodied in the kibbutz movement, lessens a competitive spirit. That simply doesn&apos;t wash with anyone who has experienced Israeli motorists or supermarket check-out queues. For Uri Avnery, the veteran Israeli commentator and activist, the Olympics \u2013 and especially the opening ceremony \u2013 was a sobering experience for his compatriots. &quot;We tend to see ourselves as the centre of the world, a power well beyond our modest size. Yet here our delegation was marching, one among many, one of the smaller ones, without the glamour some of the others possess, without a single champion that all mankind recognises. A good reason for modesty \u2013 a virtue we cannot usually boast of,&quot; he wrote. There are other, non-sporting, issues on which Israel has focused attention: the refusal of the International Olympic Committee to hold a minute&apos;s silence for the 11 Israeli athletes killed at Munich in 1972; the security provided to its participants in London this year; the row over the BBC&apos;s description of Jerusalem as the &quot;seat of government&quot; (almost the entire international community does not recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital). But such matters were not much occupying those in Mike&apos;s Place, nor in Torsina&apos;s coffee and nargila bar in Jaffa, an historic Arab neighbourhood next to Tel Aviv. Mahmoud, sucking on a shisha pipe in front of a large television screen showing live coverage of the Olympics, said he was looking forward to the resumption of nightly football matches. In the meantime, he was supporting Israel, albeit without much hope. &quot;Most people round here don&apos;t support Israel. You know why \u2013 it&apos;s about Arabs and Jews.

The row \u2013 a stark example of the sharp disagreements at the heart of Israel&apos;s political, military and intelligence establishment over the issue \u2013 came as Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Israel&apos;s existence was &quot;an insult to all humanity&quot;. In a speech to mark al-Quds Day on the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Ahmadinejad told a rally in Tehran that &quot;the Zionist regime and the Zionists are a cancerous tumour&quot; and warned against &quot;one cell of them [being] left in one inch of [Palestinian] land in the future&quot;. He added: &quot;The nations of the region will soon finish off the usurper Zionists in the Palestinian land \u2026 A new Middle East will definitely be formed. With the grace of God and help of the nations, in the new Middle East there will be no trace of the Americans and Zionists.&quot; The Iranian president has traditionally used al-Quds Day, on which rallies in support of the Palestinian people are held in many Muslim countries, to deliver invective against Israel. His words will inevitably be used to bolster arguments in favour of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Speculation has intensified recently that Netanyahu and defence minister Ehud Barak are considering launching action this autumn, before the US presidential election. In an interview on Israeli television, Peres said: &quot;It is clear to us we cannot do it on our own. We can only delay [Iran&apos;s progress]. Thus it&apos;s clear to us that we need to go together with America. There are questions of co-operation and timetables, but as severe as the danger is, at least this time we&apos;re not alone.&quot; He said he was confident that the US would take action, but added: &quot;My estimate is that they will not do this before the elections, which are more than 80 days away.&quot; Following the remarks, Netanyahu&apos;s office openly attacked the president&apos;s judgment, suggesting three previous occasions when it had been wrong. The first, according to an aide quoted in the Israeli media, was after the Oslo accords were signed in 1993, when Peres &quot;thought there would be a new Middle East&quot;. The second was following Israel&apos;s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 when &quot;he thought there would be peace \u2026 but in reality we got missiles&quot;. The aide continued: &quot;But Peres&apos;s biggest mistake was in 1981 when he opposed [Israel&apos;s] bombing of the Iraqi reactor. Luckily, prime minister Menachem Begin ignored him.&quot; Peres later stood by his comments, saying: &quot;I say what is in my heart with a loud and clear voice.&quot; The president&apos;s views echoed those of many former and current military, intelligence and political figures in Israel. US officials have also made repeated efforts to dissuade Netanyahu and Barak from unilateral action. Earlier this week, the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Martin Dempsey, said that Israel did not have the capacity to eliminate Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. &quot;I may not know about all of their capabilities. But I think it&apos;s a fair characterisation to say that they could delay but not destroy Iran&apos;s nuclear capabilities,&quot; he told reporters. Some observers believe that the current frenzied speculation about a possible Israeli strike this autumn is aimed at forcing an unequivocal public statement in the coming weeks from President Barack Obama on America&apos;s willingness to take military action against Iran, should diplomacy and sanctions fail.

The question so intrigued four scientists \u2013 all non-Bedouins \u2013 that they ran an experiment. Their study, called Why Do Bedouins Wear Black Robes in Hot Deserts?, was published in the journal Nature in 1980. &quot;It seems likely,&quot; the scientists wrote, &quot;that the present inhabitants of the Sinai, the Bedouins, would have optimised their solutions for desert survival during their long tenure in this desert. Yet one may have doubts on first encountering Bedouins wearing black robes and herding black goats. We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot\u00a0desert.&quot; The research team \u2013 C Richard Taylor and Virginia Finch of Harvard University and Amiram Shkolnik and Arieh Borut of Tel Aviv University \u2013 quickly discovered that, as you might suspect, a black robe does convey more heat inward than a white robe does. But they doubted that this was the whole story. Taylor, Finch, Shkolnik, and Borut measured the overall heat gain and loss suffered by a brave volunteer. They described the volunteer as &quot;a man standing facing the sun in the desert at midday while he wore: 1) a black Bedouin robe; 2) a similar robe that was white; 3) a tan army uniform; and 4) shorts (that is, he was semi\u2011nude)&quot;. Each of the test sessions (black-robed, white-robed, uniformed and half-naked) lasted 30 minutes. They took place in the Negev desert at the bottom of the rift valley between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. The volunteer stood in temperatures that ranged from a just-semi-sultry 35C (95F) to a character-building 46C (115F). Though he is now nameless, this was his day in the sun. The results were clear. As the report puts it: &quot;The amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe. The additional heat absorbed by the black robe was lost before it reached the skin.&quot; Bedouins&apos; robes, the scientists noted, are worn loose. Inside, the cooling happens by convection \u2013 either through a bellows action, as the robes flow in the wind, or by a chimney sort of effect, as air rises between robe and skin. Thus it was conclusively demonstrated that, at least for Bedouin robes, black is as cool as any other colour. How do our stomachs digest\u00a0animal bones? If you like shrews, especially if you like them parboiled, you&apos;ll want to devour a 1994 study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Called Human Digestive Effects on a Micromammalian Skeleton, it explains how and why one of its authors \u2013 either Brian D Crandall or Peter W Stahl; we are not told which \u2013 ate and excreted a 90mm-long (excluding the tail, which added another 24mm) northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). This was, in technical terms, &quot;a preliminary study of human digestive effects on a small insectivore skeleton&quot;, with &quot;a brief discussion of the results and their archaeological implications&quot;. Crandall and Stahl were anthropologists at the State University of New York in Binghamton. The shrew was a local specimen, procured via trapping at an unspecified location not far from the school. For the experiment&apos;s input, preparation was exacting. After being skinned and eviscerated, the report says, &quot;the carcass was lightly boiled for approximately 2 minutes and swallowed without mastication in hind and fore limb, head, and body and tail\u00a0portions&quot;. Here&apos;s how Crandall and Stahl handled the output: &quot;Faecal matter was collected for the following 3\u00a0days. Each faeces was stirred in a pan of warm water until completely disintegrated. This solution was then decanted through a quadruple-layered cheesecloth mesh. Sieved contents were rinsed with a dilute detergent solution and examined with a hand lens for bone remains.&quot; They then examined the most interesting bits with a scanning electron microscope, at magnifications ranging from 10 to 1,000 times. A shrew has lots of bony parts. All of them entered Crandall&apos;s gullet, or maybe Stahl&apos;s. But despite extraordinary efforts to find and account for each bone at journey&apos;s end, many went missing. One of the major jawbones disappeared. So did four of the 12 molar teeth, several of the major leg and foot bones, nearly all of the toe bones, and all but one of the 31 vertebrae. And the skull, reputedly a very hard chunk of bone, emerged with what the report calls &quot;significant\u00a0damage&quot;. The vanishing startled the scientists. Remember, they emphasise in their paper, that this meal was simply gulped down: &quot;The shrew was ingested without chewing; any damage occurred as the remains were processed internally. Mastication undoubtedly damages bone, but the effects of this process are perhaps repeated in the acidic, churning environment of the stomach.&quot; Chewing, they almost scream at their colleagues, is only part of the story. In each little heap of remains from ancient meals, there be mystery aplenty. Prior to this experiment, archaeologists had to, and did, make all kinds of assumptions about the animal bones they dug up, especially what those partial skeletons might indicate about the people who presumably consumed them. Crandall and Stahl, through their disciplined lack of mastication, have given their colleagues something toothsome to think about. Is a pound of lead heavier than a pound of feathers?  A pound of lead feels heavier than a pound of feathers, a thing long suspected, but not carefully tested until 2007, when Jeffrey B Wagman, Corinne Zimmerman and Christopher Sorric ran an experiment involving lead, feathers, plastic bags, cardboard boxes, a chair, blackened goggles and 23 volunteers from the town of Normal, Illinois. The scientists were based at Illinois State University, which is located in that unassumingly named place. In a study published in the journal Perception, they explained why they took the trouble. &apos;&quot;Which weighs more \u2013 a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?&apos; The seemingly naive answer to this familiar riddle is the pound of lead, whereas the correct answer is that they weigh the same amount.&quot; But, they wrote, this &quot;naive answer may not be so naive after all. For over 100 years, psychologists have known that two objects of equal mass can feel unequally heavy depending on the mass distribution of those objects.&quot; Wagman, Zimmerman, and Sorric poured some lead shot into a plastic bag, then sealed and taped the bag inside the bottom of a cardboard box. For clarity, let&apos;s call this the box with lead in its bottom. Then they stuffed a pound of goose feathers into a large plastic bag. Feathers and bags being what they are, this fluffed, baggy entity entirely filled a box that looked just like the box with lead in its bottom. Let&apos;s call this snugly packed second box the box with feathers spread throughout its innards. Then came the test. One by one, the volunteers sat in the chair, donned the blackened goggles, then &quot;placed the palm of their preferred hand up with their fingers relaxed. On a given trial, each box was placed on the participant&apos;s palm in succession. The participant hefted each box and reported which box felt heavier.&quot; Slightly more often than not, the volunteers said that the box with lead in its bottom was heavier than the box with feathers spread thoughout its innards. After weighing and judging all the data, the scientists educatedly hazarded a guess as to why one box seemed heavier. Probably, they said, it&apos;s because &quot;the mass of the feathers was distributed more or less symmetrically in the box (ie the feathers filled the box), but the mass of the lead was distributed asymmetrically along the vertical axis (the box was &quot;bottom-heavy&quot;). Therefore the box containing lead was more difficult to control and it felt heavier.&quot; The scientists did not test how volunteers would respond if the lead were fixed precisely in the middle, rather stuck to the bottom, of the box. This they left for future scientists to contemplate. How should bosses choose who to promote? Three Italian researchers were awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel prize in management for demonstrating mathematically that organisations would become more efficient if they promoted people at random. But their research was neither the beginning nor the end of the story of how bureaucracies try \u2013 and fail \u2013 to find a good promotion method. Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda and Cesare Garofalo of the University of Catania, Sicily, calculated how a pick-at-random promotion scheme compares with other more enshrined methods. They gave details in a report published in the journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications. Pluchino, Rapisarda and Garofalo based their work on the Peter Principle \u2013 the notion that many people are promoted, sooner or later, to positions that overmatch their competence. The three cited the works of other researchers who had taken tentative, exploratory steps in the same direction. They failed, however, to mention an unintentionally daring 2001 study by Steven E Phelan and Zhiang Lin, at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was published in the journal Computational and Mathematical Organisation Theory. Phelan and Lin wanted to see whether, over the long haul, it pays best to promote people on supposed merit (we try, one way or another, to measure how good you are), or on an &quot;up or out&quot; basis (either you get promoted quickly or you get the boot), or by seniority (live long and, by that measure alone, you will prosper). As a benchmark, a this-is-as-bad-as-it-could-possibly-get alternative, they also looked at what happened when you promoted people at random. They got a surprise: random promotion, they admitted, &quot;actually performed better&quot; than almost every other method. Phelan and Lin seemed (at least in my reading of their paper) almost shocked, even intimidated, by what they found. But where Pluchino, Rapisarda, and Garofalo would later, independently, hone and raise this discovery for the world to admire, Phelan and Lin merely muttered, ever so quietly in the middle of a long paragraph, that &quot;this needs to be further investigated in our future studies&quot;. Then, by and large, they moved on to other things. More recently, Phedon Nicolaides, of the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht, the Netherlands, suggested what he saw as an improvement on random promotion: randomly choose the people who will make the promotion decisions. Professor Nicolaides published his scheme in the Cyprus Mail newspaper. Another, very different, non-random method was devised for use by the US Air Force. Details appeared in a 170-page paper prepared in 2008 by Michael Schiefer, Albert Robbert, John Crown, Thomas Manacapilli, and Carolyn Wong of the Rand Corporation. But regardless of its merits, this scheme may have been doomed purely because it had a curious name. The report was called The Weighted Airman Promotion System. Do ethicists steal more\u00a0books? &quot;One might suppose that ethicists would behave with particular moral scruple,&quot; begins a little 2009 monograph by two philosophy professors who specialise in ethics, embarking on what they call a &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; of their fellow experts. Eric Schwitzgebel, of the University of California, Riverside, and Joshua Rust, of Stetson University in Deland, Florida, surveyed almost 300 attendees of a meeting of the American Philosophical Association. Tell us, they asked in a variety of ways, about the ethical behaviour of ethicists you have known. Schwitzgebel and Rust offered candy to anyone who agreed to complete the survey form. They reported that &quot;a number of people stole candy without completing a questionnaire or took more than their share without permission&quot;. The ethics experts in aggregate indicated that in their experience, on the whole, ethicists behave no more ethically than do other people. The paper, published in the journal Mind, pauses for just a moment to suggest a broader context. &quot;Police officers commit crimes,&quot; it says. &quot;Doctors smoke. Economists invest badly. Clergy flout the rules of their religion.&quot; Schwitzgebel also wrote a study, on his own, called Do Ethicists Steal More Books?, which elbowed its way into the face of readers of the journal Philosophical Psychology. He drew up lists of philosophy books \u2013 some specifically about ethics, others not. Then, using information available through computer networks, he examined the status of every copy of those books in 19 British and 13 American academic library systems. Schwitzgebel looked separately at what happened to newish books (Buchanan&apos;s Ethics, Efficiency and the Market; Baron&apos;s Kantian Ethics Almost Without Apology; Hurd&apos;s Moral Combat; and suchlike bestsellers) and to older ones (Aristotle&apos;s Nicomachean Ethics; Kant&apos;s Critique of Judgment; Nietzsche&apos;s Beyond Good and Evil and other beloved masterworks). It was roughly the same story. The ethics books, whether youthful or aged, went missing more often than did the not-quite-so-relentlessly-about-ethics books. The youthful, &quot;relatively obscure, contemporary ethics books of the sort likely to be borrowed mainly by professors and advanced students of philosophy were actually about 50% more likely to be missing&quot;. The aged, &quot;classic (pre-1900) ethics books were about twice as likely to be missing&quot;. (For those older books, Schwitzgebel looked only at the American libraries, muttering that &quot;the British library catalogue system proved impractically unwieldy&quot;.)", "publicationDate": "2012-08-18T23:00:00Z", "title": "Strange but true: science's most improbable research", "sentences": ["We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot\u00a0desert.&quot; The research team \u2013 C Richard Taylor and Virginia Finch of Harvard University and Amiram Shkolnik and Arieh Borut of Tel Aviv University \u2013 quickly discovered that, as you might suspect, a black robe does convey more heat inward than a white robe does."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/most-improbable-scientific-research-abrahams"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Manchester City", "Liverpool", "Tottenham Hotspur"], "article": "If they&apos;re anywhere near as excitable as their British equivalents (and at the risk of embracing lazy national stereotypes, let&apos;s face it they almost certainly are \u2026 and then some), at around 1pm this afternoon the presenters on Sky Sports News in Italy will hand over to their man or woman in the media room at Roma&apos;s stadium or training ground, where the camera will be pointing at a couple of empty chairs behind the top table, occasionally panning to a doorway through which nobody is walking. As the clock ticks and nothing continues to happen, viewers will be informed that at any moment, Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi is due to show up and announce that despite being a long-term target of the world&apos;s richest club Manchester City, he has decided to remain with the Giallorossi. Moments later, he&apos;ll do exactly that. Last Saturday the English champions submitted a bid for \u00a331m for De Rossi, a player they were prepared to offer an annual basic stipend of \u00a37m, but it seems Roma and their star turn, who joined them as a whey-faced teenager, are prepared to politely decline City&apos;s offer in a turn of events that is likely to leave Roberto Mancini and his employers with a rare feeling of rejection. Already the highest paid player in Serie A, De Rossi is woven into the tapestry of a club where his old man, Alberto, is on the coaching staff. Off the pitch, an ongoing custody battle for his daughter with her mother currently occupies much of his time and energy, a state of affairs which makes his decision to stay put quite understandable. In other rather depressing news for City, their contract talks with David Silva have stalled like a learner driver&apos;s car at a set of traffic lights, with the Spaniard&apos;s representatives reported to be demanding a contract that would put their client among the top earners at the club who are forced to struggle by on \u00a3200,000 per week. With a certain precious metal currently trading at \u00a333,195.72 per kilo and the zippy little Spaniard weighing in at 67kg, a year&apos;s worth of that salary would make - cough - Silva worth more well over four times his weight in gold. Considering how much he brought to City&apos;s title-winning party last season, who could argue that he isn&apos;t worth every doubloon? Harry Redknapp may have left the club and embarked on a new career as a BBC pundit and one of the public faces of Sky&apos;s Sports&apos; Fantasy Football League, but that hasn&apos;t stopped Tottenham Hotspur hogging more than their fair share of the transfer speculation headlines. In what seems like a ringing endorsement for the Hollywood maxim that &quot;nobody knows anything&quot;, despite yesterday&apos;s widespread speculation to the contrary, club suits are not interested in signing Arsenal&apos;s Morocco striker Marouane Chamakh, but are likely to focus their energies on bringing Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic to White Hart Lane instead. Tune in on Wednesday to discover that&apos;s turned out to be a skip-full of cobblers as well. Queens Park Rangers want to sign Michael Dawson from Spurs and if their shambolic opening day defensive performance is anything to go by, they could do a lot worse than take a punt on the dependable, albeit injury prone centre-half from Yorkshire. Tom Huddlestone also looks to be heading for the white Hart Lane exit door, with Stoke City reported to be keen on bringing the burly midfielder to the Britannia Stadium. In a bid to avoid any transfer deadline day palaver involving Sky&apos;s Jim White shrieking manically as a tall man from Newcastle pitches up at a new club&apos;s car-park carrying a monogrammed Louis Vuitton washbag, Liverpool will give striker Andy Carroll a week to decide what he wants to do next before consigning him to the first team fringes until they can get a decent price for him in January. Carroll has already been linked with West Ham, who are set to concede defeat in their pursuit of the Wolves winger Matt Jarvis and try to bring his 25-year-old Rennes counterpart Razak Boukari to the Boleyn Ground instead. Sunderland have added Blackburn defender Martin Olsson to a shopping list that already includes the Manchester City winger Adam Johnson and Wolves striker Steven Fletcher, but reports elsewhere suggest they will have to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool if they&apos;re to bring Johnson to the Stadium of Light. A few miles south of Wearside, Southampton are close to wrapping up their what you might call their \u00a318m &quot;double-swoop&quot; for Bologna winger Gaston Ram\u00edrez and Blackpool&apos;s Matt Phillips to St Mary&apos;s. Meanwhile in Wales, Cardiff City are on the verge of signing QPR defender Matthew Connolly.

Performing in Nice on Tuesday, Madonna again projected an image of Le Pen, but this time superimposed a question mark. By playing nice in Nice, the singer was seen to have bowed to pressure from Le Pen&apos;s Front National (FN) party, which is popular in the region. French newspapers described the move as &quot;appeasing&quot;, &quot;giving in&quot; or simply &quot;calming the controversy&quot;, and Le Pen&apos;s supporters clearly saw it as a victory. &quot;To my knowledge, Madonna has never changed a video before,&quot; said Ga\u00ebl Nofri, a spokesman for Le Pen&apos;s Blue Marine Rally conservative group, in an interview with Agence France-Presse. &quot;It&apos;s proof that our arguments won out. It&apos;s excellent news.&quot; The daughter of FN&apos;s notorious former leader, Jean-Marie, Marine Le Pen garnered almost 18% of votes in this year&apos;s French presidential election, placing third. Whereas only about 6% of ballots supported her in Paris, in Nice she received almost a quarter of the votes. Le Pen and her party are known for their strong nationalist stance, advocating for reduced immigration, and as vocal opponents of abortion, euthanasia and gay marriage. Madonna began drawing FN&apos;s ire in May, as her tour kicked off in Tel Aviv. During the performance of Nobody Knows Me, the 54-year-old was backed by projections of Pope Benedict, Sarah Palin, Hu Jintao, and other leaders who have been accused of intolerance. When Le Pen appears, a swastika flashes on her forehead. &quot;If she tries that in France, we&apos;ll be waiting for her,&quot; Le Pen said. And indeed after a gig in Paris, with the same video, the FN filed a lawsuit for public insult and defamation. More lawsuits would follow, Le Pen said, if Madonna repeated the stunt in Paris. In recent weeks Madonna has tried to quell the controversy, saying it wasn&apos;t her intention &quot;to make enemies&quot;, just &quot;to promote tolerance&quot;. She has also tried to change the subject, speaking out against the arrest of Pussy Riot, and supporting Russia&apos;s gay activists. But the controversy seriously affected French ticket sales: activists for FN were reportedly covering Madonna&apos;s posters with their own billboards, and the city of Nice claimed it had received more than 4,000 tickets to give away.

The young American&apos;s intention was to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah refugee camp, close to the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Scores of homes had already been crushed; Corrie was one of eight American and British volunteers acting as human shields for local families. &quot;She was standing on top of a pile of earth,&quot; said fellow activist and eyewitness Richard Purssell, from Brighton, at the time. &quot;The driver cannot have failed to see her. As the blade pushed the pile, the earth rose up. Rachel slid down the pile. It looks as if her foot got caught. The driver didn&apos;t slow down; he just ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.&quot; The question of whether the driver of the Caterpillar D9R bulldozer saw the young woman in the orange jacket, and drove deliberately at and over her, has been at the centre of the Corrie family&apos;s decade-long battle for accountability and justice. On Tuesday that struggle is set to culminate when an Israeli court gives its verdict in a civil lawsuit that the family have brought against the state of Israel. An Israeli Defence Forces investigation has already found that its forces were not to blame and that the bulldozer driver had not seen the activist. No charges were brought and the case was closed. The IDF report concluded: &quot;Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved.&quot; Corrie and other International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activists were accused by the investigators of &quot;illegal, irresponsible and dangerous&quot; behaviour. But witness accounts gathered in Rafah in the aftermath of Corrie&apos;s death on 16 March 2003 suggest little doubt as to what happened. According to Tom Dale, from Lichfield in Staffordshire: &quot;the bulldozer went towards her very slowly, she was fully in clear view, straight in front of them&quot;. Corrie tried to scramble on top of the earth being pushed into a mound by the bulldozer blades. &quot;Unfortunately she couldn&apos;t keep her grip there and she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble, there was panic in her face as she was turning around. All the activists there were screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they just kept on going,&quot; Dale said. The incident lasted around six or seven seconds. Corrie was taken by a Red Crescent ambulance to the Najar hospital, arriving at the emergency room at 5.05pm. She was still alive \u2013 just. At 5.20pm she was declared dead. It was, the Israeli military said later that day, a &quot;very regrettable accident&quot;. Rachel Corrie had arrived in the Holy Land on January 22, a young woman brimming with idealism, anger at injustice, and a determination to make a difference, however small. She had volunteered for the ISM, an organisation of pro-Palestinian activists who engage in direct action against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. After two days of training workshops, Corrie headed for Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. In early 2003, Israeli troops, tanks and armoured vehicles were a daily presence in Rafah and other cities. Snipers were stationed in watchtowers; helicopters and military planes buzzed in the skies. The second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, had begun more than two years before, and suicide bombers were being regularly despatched from Gaza and the West Bank to cause death and destruction in Israel. Death and destruction was also a feature of life in Gaza. Corrie was shocked by what she saw. &quot;No amount of reading, attendance at conferences, documentary viewing and word of mouth could have prepared me for the reality of the situation here. You just cannot imagine it unless you see it,&quot; she wrote in one of her many emails to family and friends at home in Olympia, Washington state, on 7 February. Three weeks later, she told her mother, Cindy, in an email: &quot;I&apos;m witnessing this chronic, insidious genocide and I&apos;m really scared, and questioning my fundamental belief in the goodness of human nature. This has to stop. I think it&apos;s a good idea for all of us to drop everything and devote our lives to making it stop... Disbelief and horror is what I feel.&quot; Corrie and other ISM activists in Rafah were mainly engaged in trying to obstruct house demolitions being carried out by the IDF, which said the targeted homes were suspected of sheltering militants or concealing the entrances to tunnels dug under the border with Egypt to facilitate the smuggling of weapons and explosives. The activists said the demolitions were collective punishment for the actions of a minority of militants. The presence of international activists was a nuisance for the IDF, but the military was not to be deterred. &quot;During war there are no civilians,&quot; an IDF training officer later told Haifa district court during a hearing into the Corrie family&apos;s civil lawsuit, implying that militants, Palestinian civilians and international activists were all legitimate targets. A Israeli military spokesman described ISM activists as &quot;a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger \u2014 the Palestinians, themselves and our forces \u2014 by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone.&quot; But Corrie&apos;s death caused an outcry far greater than that of any Palestinian. According to the Observer, nine Palestinians, including a girl, 4, and 90-year-old man, were killed on the same day. But inevitably the death of young American woman made headlines around the world and caused serious diplomatic reverberations. The next day, Israel&apos;s then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, promised US president George W Bush that Israel would conduct a &quot;thorough, credible and transparent&quot; investigation into the incident. Corrie&apos;s body was taken by the Israeli authorities to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where an autopsy was conducted. No report was published but, according to Human Rights Watch, the conclusion was that death was caused by &quot;pressure on the chest ... with fractures of the ribs and vertebrae ... and tear wounds in the right lung with haemorrhaging of the pleural cavities&quot;. The Corrie family was not satisfied with the IDF report. Seven years after their daughter&apos;s death, in March 2010, they launched a civil case against the state of Israel, accusing its military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing Corrie or of gross negligence. It was, said the family, &quot;absolutely our last resort&quot;. Sporadic hearings dragged on for 18 months. The court heard testimony from four ISM activists who witnessed the incident, but a Gaza doctor who examined Corrie&apos;s wounds was refused an entry permit to Israel to give evidence. The driver of the bulldozer, whose identity has not been made public, testified from behind a screen for &quot;security reasons&quot;. He repeatedly insisted that the first time he saw the activist was when she was already dying: &quot;I didn&apos;t see her before the incident. I saw people pulling the body out from under the earth.&quot; When the hearings ended in July last year, Corrie&apos;s mother Cindy said the family was &quot;at this moment in much the same place as we were when they began \u2013 up against a wall of Israeli officials determined to protect the state at all costs, including at the expense of truth.&quot; Last week, back in Israel for the verdict in the civil lawsuit, Cindy told the Guardian the ruling would be &quot;a milestone&quot; in the family&apos;s long battle for justice and accountability. &quot;The lawsuit is only one part of what we&apos;ve done. There has still been no &apos;thorough, credible and transparent&apos; investigation into Rachel&apos;s death. Whatever happens, this is not the end.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-08-26T23:01:04Z", "title": "Rachel Corrie death: struggle for justice culminates in Israeli court", "sentences": ["Corrie&apos;s body was taken by the Israeli authorities to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where an autopsy was conducted."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/rachel-corrie-death-israel-verdict"}, {"tags": ["Middle Eastern food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "It could all have been so different. &quot;If you had asked me 15 years ago what kind of food I would like to cook if I were to become a proper chef, I&apos;d have said very fine, finessed, Michelin-starred.&quot; Happily for anyone who&apos;s ever eaten at\u00a0one of Yotam Ottolenghi&apos;s five London places or cooked from his books (his first, Ottolenghi, is in Amazon&apos;s top 10 best-selling cookbooks ever), the\u00a0Michelin-star plan unravelled. He did try it, on the pastry section at The Capital in 1997 after abandoning a career in Israel as a journalist and academic, but &quot;I realised that that type of very structured cooking wasn&apos;t my style.&quot; By the time, two years later, he met fellow chef Sami Tamimi \u2013 like him, from Jerusalem, though from a Palestinian rather than Jewish background \u2013 he had discovered precisely what that style was. The pair, along with two other partners, opened the first Ottolenghi in 2002, serving a joyous riff on the Levantine way of eating: exuberant, sunny flavours, simple but inventive combinations, and a sense of abundance and generosity. Success came immediately, and over the next decade they opened three more branches of the eponymous deli/cafe brand, plus the slightly more glossy Nopi. Along the way, Ottolenghi breakfasts have come to define a new blueprint for the ideal way to start a weekend, and Ottolenghi recipes the default option for aspirational dinner parties. It&apos;s also made Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients such as za&apos;atar, freekeh and sumac, if not quite store-cupboard essentials, less likely to be confused by British home cooks with 1970s prog-rock albums. Still, while most enjoy the food-nerd thrill of using such obscure ingredients, they trigger indignant frustration in others. &quot;Readers complain when they can&apos;t get hold of something at their local supermarket,&quot; he says, &quot;but I always write with the home cook in mind, and often say what to use as a substitute. And if I didn&apos;t use more unusual ingredients, people wouldn&apos;t read me. Every era has its own list of ingredients that are considered exotic and then, 15 years later, they&apos;re not.&quot; His third book, Jerusalem (number three in Amazon&apos;s food and drink chart even before its publication next week) offers a little less cause for consternation, because, says Ottolenghi, it features just one curveball ingredient: date syrup. &quot;It comes from Syria and Lebanon, and has a deep, fruity sweetness. It&apos;s great drizzled on roast veg or hummus-like pur\u00e9es.&quot; It&apos;s also likely that chard&apos;s ubiquity in the book will see it surge in popularity in the way cavolo nero did after the first River Cafe Cook Book. The new book grew out of a BBC documentary he filmed on Jerusalem&apos;s food culture, and returning to the city that so shaped his own and Tamimi&apos;s approach to food was an important milestone. &quot;I\u00a0last lived there over 20 years ago, so it was interesting to go back and look at it with the eyes of a chef.

The deals (selected) \u25b6 Steven Naismith, Rangers, free; Steven Pienaar, Tottenham, \u00a34,5m; Kevin Mirallas, Olympiakos, \u00a35.3m; Bryan Oviedo, Copenhagen, \u00a32.5m; \u25c0 Jack Rodwell, Manchester City, \u00a312m; Tim Cahill, New York Red Bulls, \u00a31m; Joseph Yobo, Fenerbahce, \u00a32m; James McFadden, released; Marcus Hahnemann, released; Royston Drenthe, Real Madrid, end of loan period; Denis Stracqualursi, Tigre, end of loan spell Fulham Did they get what they wanted? A summer that saw Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey sold to Spurs can hardly feel satisfactory, though Martin Jol and the Fulham hierarchy have been creative with their replacements. A frantic final day left the squad feeling slightly sounder, and Dimitar Berbatov could prove a fine purchase at a low price if he can rediscover form of old. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Dimitar Berbatov, Manchester Utd, \u00a34m; Mladen Petric, Hamburg, free; Hugo Rodallega, Wigan, free; Sascha Riether, Cologne, loan; Kieran Richardson, Sunderland, \u00a32m; Ashkan Dejagah, Wolfsburg, undisc; \u25c0 Danny Murphy, Blackburn, free; Orlando S\u00e1, Limassol, free; Bjorn Helge Risse, Lillestrom, free; Dickson Etuhu, Blackburn, undisc; Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Tottenham, \u00a315m; Andy Johnson, QPR, free;, Clint Dempsey, Tottenham, \u00a36m Liverpool Did they get what they wanted? From the owners&apos; point of view, yes, with the wage bill reduced and several unwanted high-earners shifted on. From Brendan Rodgers&apos; stand-point, no. The Liverpool manager has acquired talent that suits his style in Joe Allen and Nuri Sahin, and is delighted to have moved on Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam, but somehow missed out on Clint Dempsey. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Fabio Borini, Roma, \u00a310.5m; Joe Allen, Swansea City, \u00a315m; Oussama Assaidi, Heerenveen, undisc; Nuri Sahin, Real Madrid, loan; Samed Yesil, Bayer Leverkusen, \u00a31m; \u25c0 Charlie Adam, Stoke, \u00a34m; Dirk Kuyt, Fenerbahce, \u00a31m; Craig Bellamy, Cardiff, free; Alberto Aquilani, Fiorentina, undisc; Maxi Rodr\u00edguez, Newell&apos;s Old Boys, free; Andy Carroll, West Ham, loan; Jay Spearing, Bolton, loan; F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio, released, , David Amoo Preston, free; Toni Silva, Barnsley, free; Manchester City Did they get what they wanted? Possibly, and Javi Garc\u00eda&apos;s late arrival certainly cheered up Roberto Mancini who had seen Robin van Persie go to Manchester United and spent the summer moaning about Brian Marwood, who controls the City transfer budget. The decision to replace Adam Johnson with Scott Sinclair was a little puzzling but Garc\u00eda could prove a key addition. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Javi Garc\u00eda, Benfica, \u00a315.8m; Jack Rodwell, Everton, \u00a315m; Scott Sinclair, Swansea City, \u00a36.2m; Maicon, Internazionale, \u00a34m; Richard Wright, free \u25c0 Adam Johnson, Sunderland, \u00a310m; Emmanuel Adebayor, Tottenham \u00a35m; Nigel de Jong, Milan, undisc; Greg Cunningham, Bristol City, undisc; Ahmed Benali, Brescia, free; Andrea Mancini, Valladolid, undisc; Owen Hargreaves, released Roque Santa Cruz, Malaga, loan; Manchester United Did they get what they wanted? Yes. Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s headline coup for the club and their supporters was undoubtedly Robin van Persie&apos;s signature, but Shinji Kagawa&apos;s, the \u00a312m arrival from Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund may prove just as exciting following a more than encouraging start to Japan international&apos;s career at Old Trafford. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Robin van Persie, Arsenal, \u00a323m; Shinji Kagawa, Borussia Dortmund, \u00a312m; Nick Powell, Crewe, \u00a34m; Alexander Buttner, Vitesse Arnhem, \u00a34m \u25c0 Dimitar Berbatov, Fulham, \u00a34m; Park Ji-sung, QPR, \u00a32m; Tomasz Kuszczak, Brighton, free; Paul Pogba, Juventus, undisc; Oliver Norwood, Huddersfield, free; Liam Jacobs, Oldham, undisc; Newcastle United Did they get what they wanted? Sort of but not exactly. Significantly, Alan Pardew kept his best players but failed to secure long-term targets Matthieu Debuchy, Douglas and Andy Carroll. Vurnon Anita is the sole first team signing. With Ryan Taylor injured they lack cover at full back and, further forward, will be praying Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Demba Ba stay fit. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Vurnon Anita, Ajax, \u00a36.7m; Curtis Good, Melbourne Heart, \u00a3400,000; Gael Bigirimana, Coventry, undisc; Romain Amalfitano Reima, free; \u25c0 Leon Best, Blackburn Rovers, \u00a33m; Fraser Foster, Celtic, \u00a33m; Danny Guthrie, Reading, free; Alan Smith, MK Dons, free; Tamas Kadar, Roda JC, free; Norwich City Did they get what they wanted? Norwich would have been hoping to bolster their strike force, but have not been able to do so, although keeping Grant Holt at the club could prove as important as a new signing. Other signings, like Alexander Tettey who arrived from Rennes, will strengthen a squad trying to cope with its second season in the top flight. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Robert Snodgrass, Leeds Utd, \u00a33m; S\u00e9bastien Bassong, Tottenham, undisc; Steven Whittaker, Rangers, free; Alexander Tettey, Rennes, undisc; Javier Garrido, Lazio, loan; Michael Turner, Sunderland, undisc; Jacob Butterfield, Barnsley, undisc; Ryan Bennett, Peterborough, loan \u25c0 Zak Whitbread released, Aaron Wilbrahim released Josh Dawkin released Matt Ball released Andrew Crofts Brighton, undisc Daniel Ayala Nottm Forest, loan Queens Park Rangers Did they get what they wanted? In as much as they have virtually added an entirely new squad, with players who have featured heavily in the Premier League. The arrival of Esteban Granero and J\u00falio C\u00e9sar are particularly intriguing, even if Rob Green must be crestfallen to have been usurped as No1 already. This squad has huge depth, even if the team feels flung together. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Rob Green, West Ham, free; Samba Diakit\u00e9, Nancy, undisc; Park Ji-sung, Man Utd, \u00a32m; Junior Hoilett, Blackburn, tribunal; J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Internazionale, free; Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, Chelsea, free; Andy Johnson, Fulham, free; Ryan Nelsen, Blackburn, free; Esteben Granero, Real Madrid, undisc; St\u00e9phane Mbia, Marseille, undisc; F\u00e1bio da Silva, Man Utd, loan; \u25c0 Paddy Kenny, Leeds Utd, \u00a3400,000; Fitz Hall, Watford, free; Rowan Vine, St Johnstone, free; Joey Barton, Marseille, loan; Jay Bothroyd, Sheffield Wednesday, loan; Reading Did they get what they wanted? Pretty much and they also did their business early, enabling Brian McDermott, the Reading manager, to integrate the new signings during pre-season. Russian striker Pavel Pogrebnyak is the most eye-catching while Garath McCleary has the potential to be one of the best free transfers of this window. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Chris Gunter, Nottm Forest, \u00a32.5m; Adrian Mariappa, Watford, undisc; Pierce Sweeney, Bray Wanderers, undisc; Pavel Pogrebnyak, Fulham, free; Danny Guthrie, Newcastle, free; Garath McCleary, Nottingham Forest, free; Nicky Shorey, WBA, free; Stuart Taylor, Manchester City, free; \u25c0 Micail Antonio, Sheffield Wed, undisc; Tomasz Cywka, Barnsley, free; Brian Howard, Portsmouth, free; Andy Griffin, released; Joseph Mills, Burnley, loan; Southampton Did they get what they wanted? Southampton broke their transfer record over the course of the summer, which points to proper ambition to retain their place back in the Premier League. The young Uruguayan playmaker Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez is an eye-catching addition and Nathaniel Clyne appears a steal, though there may have to be more spending in January if they are to survive. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, Bologna, \u00a312m; Steve Davis, Rangers, free; Nathaniel Clyne, Crystal Palace, \u00a32m; Paulo Gazzaniga, Gillingham, undisc; Emmanuel Mayuka, Young Boys, undisc; Jay Rodriguez, Burnley, \u00a36m; Maya Yoshida, VVV Venlo, undisc; \u25c0 Ryan Doble, Shrewsbury, free; Dan Harding, Nottm Forest, undisc; Tommy Forecast, Gillingham, loan; Aaron Martin, Crystal Palace, loan; Jonathan Forte, Crawley, loan; Billy Sharp, Nottm Forest, loan; Radhi Jaidi, released Stoke City Did they get what they wanted? In Tony Pulis&apos;s eyes, probably not. The Stoke manager used his programme notes last Sunday to stress the importance of strengthening but after years of heavy investment the club has spent carefully. Charlie Adam will add some much needed imagination to midfield while Kightly, if he stays fit, promises to be a decent addition. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Michael Kightly, Wolves, \u00a33m; Geoff Cameron, Houston Dynamo, undisc; Jamie Ness, Rangers, free; Charlie Adam, Liverpool, \u00a34m; Steven Nzonzi, Blackburn, undisc; \u25c0 Danny Collins, Nottm Forest, undisc; Jonathan Woodgate, Middlesbrough, free; Andrew Davies, Bradford free; Salif Diao, released; Ricardo Fuller, free; Louis Moult, Northampton Town, free; Tom Soares released Sunderland Did they get what they wanted? Martin O&apos;Neill wanted to add goals and trickery to his team and did so in the shape of Steven Fletcher and Adam Johnson, while also pruning an overblown, poorly balanced, squad. Importantly, the Sunderland manager also persauded the much coveted Stephane Sess\u00e8gnon to agree a contract extension. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Adam Johnson, Manchester City, \u00a310m; Steven Fletcher, Wolves, \u00a312m; Louis Saha, Tottenham, free; Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, Aston Villa, free; Danny Rose, Tottenham, loan; \u25c0 Kieran Richardson, Sunderland, \u00a32m; Marcos Angeleri, Estudiantes, undisc; Asamoah Gyan, Al-Anin, \u00a36m; Michael Turner, Norwich, undisc; George McCartney, West Ham, undisc; Craig Gordon, released; Ahmed El-Mohamady, Hull City, loan Swansea City Did they get what they wanted? Paying \u00a32m for Michu, the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga last season, could be the best signing of the summer and there is understandable excitement about the arrival of Ki Sung Yeung and the club-record deal that brought Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez to south Wales on deadline day. Those days at &apos;The Vetch&apos; feel like a distant memory. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Michu, Rayo Vallencano, \u00a32m; Jose Manuel Flores, Genoa, \u00a32m; Jonathan de Guzman, Villarreal, loan; Kyle Bartley, Arsenal, undisc; Jamie Proctor, Preston, undisc; Ki Sung-yeung, Celtic, \u00a35.5m; Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, Valencia, \u00a35.5m \u25c0 Joe Allen, Liverpool, \u00a315m; Scott Sinclair, Manchester City, \u00a38m; Ferrie Bodde, released; Casey Thomas, released; Joe Walsh, Crawley, free; Scott Donnelly, free; Andrea Orlandi, Brighton, undisc; Tottenham Hotspur Did they get what they wanted? Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has admitted he was too &quot;aggressive&quot; with his changes at Chelsea, and the evolution under him at Tottenham would be more gradual. A whirlwind summer market has done little to support his claim, however, as big names were signed, plenty of others were chased and what could make up a decent starting XI were sold. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Gylfi Sigurdsson, Hoffenheim, \u00a38m; Jan Vertonghen, Ajax, \u00a310m; Emmanuel Adebayor, Manchester City, \u00a35m; Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Fulham, \u00a315m; Clint Dempsey, Fulham, \u00a36m; Hugo Lloris, Lyon, \u00a37.9m \u25c0 Luka Modric, Real Madrid, \u00a330m; Niko Kranjcar, Dynamo Kyiv, \u00a35.5m; Vedran Corluka, Lokomotiv Moscow, undisc; Steven Pienaar, Everton, \u00a34.5m; S\u00e9bastien Bassong, Norwich, undisc; Rafael van der Vaart, Hamburg, \u00a310m; Ryan Nelsen, QPR, free; Louis Saha, Sunderland, released; West Ham United Did they get what they wanted? Sam Allardyce has overhauled his Championship play-off winning squad but it has been the loan signing of Andy Carroll that has quickened the pulses at West Ham. In the striker, the club have a rough diamond and with Matt Jarvis bought to add threat from wide areas, there is the sense of optimism. Carroll could make the difference. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Matt Jarvis, Wolves, \u00a310.75m; George McCartney, Sunderland, free; Jussi Jaaskelainen, Bolton, free; Modibo Ma\u00efga, Sochaux, \u00a34.7m; Mohamed Diam\u00e9, Wigan, free; James Collins, Aston Villa, \u00a32.5m; Alou Diarra, Marseille, \u00a32m; Andy Carroll, Liverpool, loan Yossi Benayoun, Chelsea, loan; \u25c0 Rob Green, QPR, free; Freddie Sears, Colchester, free; Abdoulaye Faye, Hull, free; Julien Faubert, Elazigspor, free; John Carew, released; Sam Baldock, Bristol City, \u00a31.1m West Bromwich Albion Did they get what they wanted? It could hardly have gone much better at The Hawthorns. Ben Foster&apos;s permanent signing was tied up quickly and the club look to have unearthed another gem in Claudio Yacob, who arrived on a free. Romelu Lukaku has arrived with a point to prove and has given Steve Clarke, the new manager, plenty of forward options for the season ahead. The deals (selected) \u25b6 Ben Foster, Birmingham City, undisc; Markus Rosenberg, Werder Bremen, free; Claudio Yacob, Racing Club de Avellaneda, free; Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea, loan; Yassine El Ghanassy, AA Gent, loan; Goran Popov, Dynamo Kiev, loan \u25c0 Keith Andrews, Bolton, free; Joe Mattock, Sheffield Wed, free; Nicky Shorey, Reading, free; Somen Tchoyi, released; Martin Fulop, Asteras Tripoli, free; Paul Scharner, Hamburg, free; Simon Cox, Nottm Forest, undisc; Wigan Athletic Did they get what they wanted? Roberto Mart\u00ednez claims to be satisfied with Wigan&apos;s work and the quality of their additions certainly justifies that stance. Losing Victor Moses, who was crucial to the club&apos;s impressive form last season, is a major loss, however. There doubts about where the creativity will come from in a squad that has lost a lot of Premier League experience.

A judge decided that national security trumped the rights of journalists because, without the former, there would be no state and therefore no newspapers. That was the conclusion to a case involving Uri Blau, a reporter with Israel&apos;s Haaretz newspaper, who was sentenced to four months&apos; community service under a plea bargain for possessing classified military documents. In a written judgement delivered at Tel Aviv magistrates court, judge Ido Druyan said: &quot;I accept the plea bargain reached by the parties, and sentence the accused to a single term of four months&apos; jail which may be served by means of community service... starting from 11 September 2012.&quot; Blau, who will do his community service at a medical centre, was convicted in July of possessing secret army papers that he received from a former soldier who was subsequently jailed on charges of spying. He told reporters outside court: &quot;This is a very sad day. The prosecution should not have filed an indictment to begin with.&quot; One of his lawyers, Jack Hen, has described the &quot;prosecution of a journalist for doing his job&quot; as &quot;precedent-setting&quot;. He pointed out that Blau&apos;s reports had been cleared by the military censor. &quot;The public&apos;s right to know and freedom of the press were seriously damaged by the decision to put a journalist on trial for these reasons,&quot; he told Haaretz. Court documents showed that former soldier Anat Kam handed some 1,800 documents to Blau who used some of them as the source for an article in 2008 which said troops had been ordered to carry out targeted killings of Palestinian militants in violation of a supreme court order. Blau later handed over all the classified documents in his possession to the security establishment. Kam was sentenced to four and a half years in jail in October 2011 after pleading guilty to leaking the documents.

It&apos;s the site of a future American embassy to Israel that, for nearly two decades, the US Congress has demanded be built immediately. But once American presidents begin navigating the minefield of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they quickly realise they don&apos;t need to add to their problems by shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv - a unilateral statement on the status of Jerusalem. Just how sensitive the issue of Jerusalem is was laid bare at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday when, fearing accusations of not being pro-Israel enough, the party leadership hurriedly revived a clause in the platform from previous years proclaiming the city as the Jewish state&apos;s capital when much of the rest of the world withholds recognition. The DNC also said Jerusalem should be an &quot;undivided city&quot;, while contradicting itself by adding that the issue is subject to negotiation with the Palestinians, who claim occupied East Jerusalem as their own capital. That&apos;s exactly what the Democratic party platform said when Barack Obama was elected in 2008. But as president, he has not done any more than his predecessors to act on the vexed issue of the embassy. It&apos;s a reflection of the split US stance toward Israel that Congress and political parties are given to highly partisan declarations of support for the Jewish state, driven by domestic politics and a powerful lobby, while presidents are forced to maintain the pretence of neutral arbiter in the diplomatic machinations that have failed to deliver an end to occupation and a free Palestinian state. At the heart of the fuss at the DNC is Israel&apos;s demand that the world recognise all of Jerusalem as its capital. Although it&apos;s evident that functionally the city is the Jewish state&apos;s capital, even close allies such as Britain say that to give formal recognition would be to legitimise the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem when talks with Palestinians are meant to decide its status, even if an agreement looks a distant prospect. So most countries, including the US, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv and generally speak about Jerusalem as the seat of the Israeli government. But the US Congress has taken a contrary position \u2013 in its enthusiasm to be as pro-Israel as possible. In 1995, the Republican-led Congress passed a law requiring the US embassy to be moved to Jerusalem by 1999. President Bill Clinton declined to do so as he attempted to shepherd Yasser Arafat and various Israeli leaders toward a deal. George W Bush attacked Clinton for it. &quot;As soon as I take office I will begin the process of moving the US ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,&quot; he told the pro-Israel lobby in 2000. The Republican party election platform made an explicit commitment to move the embassy. But once Bush was in the White House, he, too, failed to make the move. In 2008, as Barack Obama ran for president, the Democratic party platform said:  &quot;Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.&quot;  The then presidential candidate said he recognised Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital. But, like his predecessors, Obama has declined to act on the 1995 law in the face of other Middle Eastern realities, not least the repercussions in a changing Arab world. In July, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not be drawn on what the capital of Israel is. The US state department has for years fought lawsuits over its refusal to enter &quot;Jerusalem, Israel&quot; as a place of birth on American passports, even though Congress has passed a law saying it must. Sane diplomatic positions pertain while the future of the city remains unresolved. But now, it&apos;s election season \u2013 and what matters is the loyalty test. It&apos;s not clear how the routine commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as the Israeli capital got dropped from this year&apos;s Democratic party platform, but Obama was worried enough, not least about votes in knife-edge Florida which has a significant Jewish electorate, to intervene and get it reinstated. Mitt Romney \u2013 playing not only to part of the Jewish vote (which will mostly go to Obama), but as much to a larger Christian fundamentalist constituency solid in its support of Israel \u2013 quickly sought to capitalise on the debacle by again suggesting Obama is not truly committed. It&apos;s not the first time Romney has played the Jerusalem card. In June, he told CNN he would like to move the US embassy to the city. But the Republican presidential contender tried to give himself an out by saying that he &quot;would only want to do so and to select the timing in accordance with the government of Israel&quot;. Well, Israel would like it to happen yesterday. If Romney is elected, he&apos;s not likely to shift from the position of his three predecessors, which is that it&apos;s not in the US&apos;s interest to move its embassy to Jerusalem any time soon. Which leaves congressional declarations, party commitments and the fleeting controversy over the Democratic platform as nothing more than noise \u2013 which is all about US politics, not Middle East peace. What that really highlights is the lack of any real discussion in this election of what needs to be done to reach an agreement on Jerusalem and bring about a Palestinian state. \u2022 Commenting on this article will be on for 24 hours and may be turned off overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-09-06T12:10:00Z", "title": "The Democrats' misstep on Jerusalem and Israel's place in the US election | Chris McGreal", "sentences": ["But once American presidents begin navigating the minefield of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they quickly realise they don&apos;t need to add to their problems by shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv - a unilateral statement on the status of Jerusalem.", "So most countries, including the US, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv and generally speak about Jerusalem as the seat of the Israeli government."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/democrats-misstep-jerusalem-israel-us-election"}, {"tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Opera", "Ratko Mladic", "Conducting"], "article": "In February 1965 the Hungarian director of the Royal Opera House \u2013 emerging as incontestably the greatest conductor of his generation \u2013 flew to Tel Aviv to lead a series of performances by the Israel Philharmonic. Georg Solti had for a while been much enamoured by young television reporter Valerie Pitts, who had interviewed him in the Savoy hotel a few months previously, in September 1964, and he had pressed her to join him on the road. Early in March 1965 she duly arrived in the Middle East and Solti was asked by the singer Ken McDonald how long the comely blond visitor was planning to stay. &quot;For the rest of her life,&quot; replied the maestro. Pitts had been working as an interviewer and announcer for the BBC, with her own programme covering cultural events in the week ahead. &quot;I wrote and researched the programme during the previous week, ready for transmission on a Monday evening,&quot; recalls Lady Solti today. &quot;At the end of August there was a last-minute change of plan. The clip of the new film I was going to talk about was held up in customs. I was in a total panic. It was Friday afternoon and I had to find an item. So I thought: the Royal Opera House \u2013 maybe they&apos;ve got a ballet or an opera \u2013 and Sheila Porter in the Opera House press office said, &apos;Well, there&apos;s always Solti. He&apos;s doing a new Ring.&apos; She rang back a few minutes later, saying: &apos;He&apos;ll do it. Make yourself pretty and be there at 11, at the Savoy.&apos; That was all very well but where on a Friday at 5.30 was I going to find a film crew for the next day? &quot;A minor miracle happened \u2013 the BBC could send a crew, providing I could finish in time for them to be at Arsenal football ground for the kick-off. So off I went to interview Solti, without knowing quite what I was going to talk to him about. I knew nothing of the Ring, except that it was very long, in German and by Richard Wagner.&quot; &quot;When I arrived at the Savoy the film crew were becoming agitated as there was no sign of him. The receptionist told me that Dr Solti was in his room. I went up in a lift which was transformed into a red lacquer temple, found the room, knocked on the door and a guttural voice said: &apos;What do you want?&apos; I said I was from the BBC, and suddenly the door flew open and there he was, wrapped up in steaming towels. &apos;My dear, I&apos;m so sorry,&apos; he said. &apos;I forgot. Do you think you could find my socks?&apos; &quot;So I was looking for his socks under the bed and suddenly the door flew open and there was the head of the opera house press office, saying: &apos;Valerie, what are you doing there?&apos; \u2013 with me, bottom in the air, searching for Solti&apos;s socks.&quot; The young reporter admitted to the maestro: &quot;I&apos;m not awfully good on opera. Truthfully, I don&apos;t like it much because I saw a frightful production in Frankfurt \u2013 Elektra, I think. It was horrid.&quot; There followed a terrible pause, then Solti&apos;s brown eyes twinkled. &quot;My dear, what year was that?&quot; he asked. Then he laughed: &quot;Thank you very much. I was conducting.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s how it all began,&quot; says Lady Solti. &quot;I was bewitched \u2013 captivated \u2013 by this man, and logic and pragmatism just flew out of the window. It was a coup de foudre. After months of turmoil I went to Israel. I arrived to a hotel room which he had filled with vases of carnations and antirrhinums. A few days later he dictated my letter of resignation to the BBC!&quot; We are speaking in Solti&apos;s London studio which is rather like a museum, now frequently used by young musicians as a place where they can study and rehearse. The place is vibrant with creativity. On Solti&apos;s old desk is a fragment of the living past \u2013 a score of Bach&apos;s St John Passion, on which Solti was working when he died, covered with his hallmark annotations in lead pencil and red crayon \u2013 his two strata of excavation and analysis of the composer&apos;s intent. Next month marks the centenary of the birth of the conductor, musician, visionary, jester, husband and father who bore witness to, and embodies, his time, the core of the 20th century, and whose genius \u2013 a word too liberally used nowadays \u2013 not only towered over the music-making of his lifetime but radically changed it in ways that are only now becoming clear. Fittingly, the 100 years that have passed since his birth will be celebrated in the city he made his musical home, Chicago, with a concert by the World Orchestra for Peace \u2013 which Solti founded in Geneva in 1995 for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The concert will be on his birthday, 21 October, at Symphony Centre in Chicago. (Another concert will have taken place in New York at Carnegie Hall on 19 October). The World Orchestra for Peace is made up of the finest musicians on the planet, who volunteer to convene from time to time to deliver the message embodied by the orchestra&apos;s name. Solti did this: resurrecting a very 19th century, romantic and didactic purpose for music into the ravaged 20th century \u2013 and now the orchestra performs in his name, beyond his lifetime, into the ominous 21st. The concert will be conducted by Valery Gergiev, and feature musicians who were part of Solti&apos;s mission to encourage newcomers and to hand on to future generations what he had learned from his own masters. Two great stars, Angela Gheorghiu and Ren\u00e9 Pape, both of whom began the formative part of their careers with Solti, will be joined by as yet unknown young singers from the Georg Solti Accademia, a masterclass in bel canto singing which is held annually in Solti&apos;s Italian home of Castiglione della Pescaia. But Solti did so much more: he made music of magic and quality, entwining power and clarity, that no other interpreter of his time \u2013 not even Karajan, Jansons, Ancerl, B\u00f6hm or Bernstein, in what is rightly considered music&apos;s golden age \u2013 could match. In the studio, Solti revolutionised the science and art of recorded music so as to democratise it at the highest \u2013 still unsurpassed \u2013 level of atmosphere and sound quality. And in concert, Solti is the only name one can speak in the same breath as those that dominated the generation that preceded him \u2013 astride both the second world war and the iron curtain \u2013 Evgeny Mravinsky in Leningrad and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler in Berlin. Solti was the true heir to their legacy on record, and their way of electrifying live performance through blending restless and rigorous perfectionism with explosive\u00a0spontaneity. Georg Solti was born Gy\u00f6rgy Stern, the son of Ter\u00e9z Rosenbaum and M\u00f3ricz Stern. At the end of the first world war Hungarians with Germanic surnames were encouraged to adopt Hungarian names. His parents kept the family&apos;s original surname but his father decided the children&apos;s names should be changed to help their careers. He chose Solti at random \u2013 the name of a small Hungarian town. Thus Georg kept the same initials, GS. In his autobiography, Solti describes his father as a businessman who &quot;trusted everyone and was often cheated&quot;. Young Solti was admitted to the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied piano and composition, and thereafter became a repetiteur at the state opera. But as a Jew, Solti and many others employees of the opera house were dismissed once anti-Jewish laws came into force. As is still the case today, it is difficult for young conductors to find work so Solti went to Karlsruhe in Germany, where he was hired by the great Josef Krips, who was duly denounced for hiring an Ostjude \u2013 a Jew from the east. In 1937, while attending rehearsals at the Salzburg festival, he was asked to replace one of Toscanini&apos;s assistants, who could not play because of illness. In 1938 the officials of the Hungarian Opera, having heard that Solti had worked with Toscanini, invited him to conduct a performance of The Marriage of Figaro with the Budapest Opera. The date was 11 March 1938. It was a great day for Solti and his family. Halfway through the performance the news broke of German troops marching into Vienna. The show ended and he never conducted an opera there again. The Hungarian composer Antal Dor\u00e1ti heard of his young friend&apos;s dilemma and invited him to join him for two weeks in London, conducting for Colonel de Basil&apos;s Ballets Russes. From there Solti made his way home where, in August 1939, &quot;at the age of 26,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I said goodbye to my mother and sister.&quot; At Budapest station he was seen off to Switzerland by his father on the very day that war was declared. &quot;I was never to see him again,&quot; Solti would write. There are remarkable pictures of Solti during his wartime years as a refugee in Zurich. In those days people made photographs of themselves into picture postcards, and Solti sent home cards of himself posing in Alpine dress outside his mountain chalet. He described himself as &quot;desperately lonely and depressed&quot; as he waited for war to end, though he occasionally conducted the Zurich orchestra in the Kleine (junior) Tonhalle. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Solti was invited to \u2013 of all places \u2013 Munich. His decision to establish himself as a Jew among the ravages of the Reich was astonishingly foresighted; he was among the few to understand postwar Germany and Europe right at their inception, compelled by Winston Churchill&apos;s speech in Zurich inviting Germany and France to build a &quot;new Europe&quot; on the ashes of war. He also confessed: &quot;Like Faust, I would have been prepared to make a pact with the devil and go to hell with him in order to conduct.&quot; Directorship of the Bavarian State Opera in 1946 was his first and crucial post. &quot;It was a heroic time, both for Germany and for myself,&quot; he wrote. Lady Solti reflects: &quot;People asked: &apos;But how could you, as a Jew, go to Germany?&apos; I think Gyuri [short for Gy\u00f6rgy] felt: look, we&apos;re all young people in our 30s, and it&apos;s our mission to create a Europe in which that cannot happen again. What were [we] to do with Germany? Put a barbed wire fence around it? But he didn&apos;t go there as a missionary \u2013 he went because he was offered a job. It was also fortuitous \u2013 Germany was de-Nazifying, and it must have been an amazing time.&quot; Solti moved on to Frankfurt, then London \u2013 succeeding Rafael Kubel\u00edk as director of Covent Garden in 1961, and by the mid-60s bringing the house to a zenith. Solti wrote later: &quot;I have a British wife and two British daughters, and British I shall remain&quot;; but also: &quot;I am a committed European,&quot; He was never really settled; his orchestral career was centred on the Vienna Philharmonic and Chicago, and he wrote later: &quot;My term as musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was the happiest time in my professional life.&quot; This was a Hungarian who as a refugee made Switzerland his home, then came to raise a family in London, had a house in Italy and an orchestra in America \u2013 a man without race or nation. Lady Solti says: &quot;He hated the term &apos;cosmopolitan&apos;. Let&apos;s say he was a man who had lost his family and his country, so that home was wherever his own family was, and wherever he was making music. He was a person of the world; with a deep sense of the world, and a belief in the new Europe, right from its very beginning.&quot; It is hard to express what it is that elevates a great artist over a very good one, and impossible to account for the creative sorcery which enables someone like Solti to tower even above the greats, to achieve what he could with an orchestra, on record and in performance. There are certain composers on whose work Solti has stamped his mark with a distinction that has never been equalled, nor probably ever will be, so that his conduit of their intentions has become integral to the experience of listening to them: Wagner, Strauss and Mozart arguably \u2013 Mahler unquestionably. I remember sitting enthralled \u2013 even in adolescence, knowing little of the context \u2013 ear-to-the-speaker with my new edition of Mahler&apos;s Resurrection Symphony, bought with pocket money. And in concert: Solti&apos;s shattering Mahler Ninth at the Royal Festival Hall with the Chicago orchestra in 1981 left anyone who heard it dazed with wonderment. It is due almost entirely to Solti that Mahler&apos;s music moved from relative obscurity in the early 1960s to the sell-out position it now occupies in the performing repertoire. Lady Solti is captivating on her husband&apos;s discovery of Mahler: &quot;I think he recognised the sounds in Mahler as those of where he came from. He knew some of those sounds intuitively, the cowbells, they called to his intuition, and were familiar to him. He would say: this music is wonderful but we never hear it.&quot; Just as Solti had understood the new Germany while most (in his and every field) were still mired in wartime thinking, he also understood the need to perform and record Wagner. Richard Wagner was seen after the war as the composer whose antisemitism and interpretation of Teutonic myth was adulated, some would say kidnapped, by the Nazis. Yet it was his music Solti now performed to a standard no one but perhaps F\u00fcrtwangler had achieved. (But then F\u00fcrtwangler was \u2013 albeit as a man of genius fraught with political dichotomies \u2013 conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic under the Third Reich.) &quot;Maybe,&quot; says Lady Solti, &quot;he knew the full background and chose not to take any heed. Or maybe he just wiped all that from his mind when it came to Wagner. I honestly don&apos;t know. But I do know that people just did not talk about the horrors at that time. They were not looking back because they were looking forward with their duty to make a new and better world.&quot; She continues talking about her husband &quot;wanting to live every moment&quot;. This was, she says, &quot;part, I am sure, of the survival thing he always had, like every Jewish-central-European of his age. He was Jewish with all that means in terms of the history of his generation \u2013 with an understanding of people and of survival that Anglo-Saxons have never really had to learn. I think the survival thing is crucial. &quot;He had a sense of the beauty in all things, something I would call spiritual rather than religious. He told me his father would pray when eating the first fruit of the season. I remember so clearly the special moment for Solti when he ate the first apricot, cherry or peach in Italy. He loved animals and birds and used to ask, &apos;How can humans kill animals and birds for food?&apos; He loved listening to the birds singing in the trees, and he would whistle to them and they in turn would answer him, because of course he had perfect pitch. He loved the sea \u2013 looking at it and swimming in it \u2013 but disliked sailing on it.&quot; He took pleasure even in the little things, and would be &quot;ridiculously happy winning at games \u2013 ping-pong, tennis, cards or bridge, particularly if he bid a grand slam and made it. He loved trains and railway stations, and introduced me to the glories of station buffets, particularly the one in Lausanne in Switzerland and the Gare de Lyon in Paris. He had such an enthusiasm about everything he did and wanted to share everything \u2013 food, music, nature, jokes, literature. It was the same with music \u2013 the joy of working with an orchestra he loved, the joy of being with his musician friends, and the pleasure of working with the musicians around him and sharing the music. &quot;He was a working musician,&quot; Lady Solti continues, &quot;fundamentally a working musician. Although he became a star he was also an artisan, working with and for the music. He used to say: &apos;No matter what statements I make, no matter who I know and what receptions I go to, I am first and foremost a musician \u2013 that is what I am: a musician at the service of the composer whose music I am playing.&apos;&quot; Solti was known by everyone he met or worked with for a blend of striving and of perfectionism \u2013 for pursuing the unattainable, never satisfied with what he had achieved, however magnificent it was hailed as being. &quot;He once said,&quot; says Lady Solti: &quot;&apos;If ever I tell you that was a good performance, you know I am not well.&apos;&quot;. In his autobiography Solti describes how he learned from F\u00fcrtwangler \u2013 of whom he speaks as something like the teacher he never had \u2013 &quot;that all serious artists are often dissatisfied with their work&quot;. There was another riptide cutting beneath this dissatisfaction, this striving: &quot;Gyuri used to say that the musician is the servant of the composer, and no one could ever be certain exactly what the composer&apos;s intention was, they could only try their best. Perhaps that was a reason he was never satisfied.&quot; Although he loved accolades, he always said that nothing in his entire career had made him happier than when he was playing the piano for a rehearsal in Salzburg in 1937, and felt a presence behind him. It was Toscanini, and Toscanini simply said: &quot;Bene.&quot; &quot;Gyuri always said that no accolade in his entire life matched that single word from Toscanini.&quot; In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was in the windy city that Solti became so rooted in local lore that his image was used on posters to advertise both the orchestra and the Bears football team, under the slogan: &quot;We both know a good score&quot;. &quot;If he had a musical home,&quot; says Lady Solti, &quot;it must surely be Chicago.&quot; And yet, for a family with two daughters, &quot;this was a compromise. I&apos;m an only child, and he had no family \u2013 so here were these two desperate creatures, with two lovely little girls \u2013 but no family structure apart from my parents. We thought, in our innocence, we could do it all. For him, it was the music and the joie de vivre, and for me \u2013 well, I just hit the ground running \u2013 and I still am in a way. Initially, the girls went to school in London and Chicago but it didn&apos;t really work. So from that point onwards the schedule in Chicago was planned years ahead to incorporate school holidays, and we&apos;d go to faraway places and the girls would travel with us. But in summer we would all go to Italy where the maestro had his studio in the garden and divided his time between studying and spending time with the children. &quot;People would ask: &apos;Where do you live? Where&apos;s home?&apos; \u2013 and it was difficult to say. It would have been nice to have a little cottage with roses round the door but that didn&apos;t come into it really.&quot; Lady Solti throws back her head, laughing. &quot;We were Gypsies, nomads \u2013 we always thought it would be fantastic to have some kind of amphibious, aeronautical caravan and trailer that could fly and sail to wherever we wanted. That would have been my dream.&quot; For the last twenty years of his life, Solti engaged one man to be something like a master of ceremonies, an executive director who made sure that the conditions were right for the music-making, keeper of the gates marked budget and logistics. Charles Kaye, now director of the World Orchestra for Peace, remembers being told: &quot;I&apos;m looking for someone who can look after all this&quot; and thinking: &quot;What can I bring to this? I&apos;d worked with Lucia Popp, Nicolai Gedda, Askenazy \u2013 but Solti was God in this world.&quot; Kaye gives a description of Solti at work: &quot;He would look at a work he had performed a hundred times before, but was still excited to see a new, unmarked score. And he&apos;s start to mark it; first in pencil, then in red&quot; \u2013 and Kaye produces, across the table of a friend&apos;s kitchen in Hampstead, a score by Brahms, thick with annotations and notes; a soft, probably 2B pencil, then the red crayon. &quot;What he did better than anyone else in the world was study the music, and turn his ideas into action. You could watch him working it out, having a hundred ideas a minute for a recording or a performance, the cast or conditions he wanted. My job was to enable him to work in the best conditions possible \u2013 what would Solti need in order to make this performance or recording the best possible \u2013 and send the shopping list ahead. Occasionally I&apos;d have to say something like &apos;We&apos;ll never get that past Decca&apos;, but there was no saying no, unless there was a very good reason.&quot; It is incontestable that Solti both revolutionised recorded music and set a standard of sound that has never been attained since. His Wagner Ring cycle from the 1960s was recently crowned by BBC Music Magazine as the greatest recording feat of all time. Solti assembled around him a group of producers and engineers who became known as &quot;the Decca boys&quot; under John Culshaw at a time when the British label was at its zenith. &quot;At the time,&quot; says Lady Solti, &quot;when television was new, and later with the advent of colour television and the development of video, there was also an excitement around what could be done for the gramophone after the advent of the long-playing record.&quot; A democratic urge was at work in Solti&apos;s enterprise \u2013 that the mass dissemination of music in the home should be of the highest quality. And there was also science. John Pellowe joined the Decca boys as a young engineer from north London who &quot;didn&apos;t make it to university&quot; but was blessed with synesthesia \u2013 seeing music as a series of colours. Not a great musician, but instinctive about music at a time when Britain led the world in acoustics and gramophone equipment \u2013 Wharfedale, Kef and Quad. &quot;The idea that we could make recorded music with breadth and width like that,&quot; says Pellowe, &quot;enabled a whole new generation, a new era, in music. And Solti had a real passion for the studio \u2013 he fuelled the central tenets of what the philosophy of recording became. It was something primaeval \u2013 he knew what he wanted. Solti was fascinated by acoustics, by an acoustic space. He understood that the acoustic space can be just as important as the notes on the score or quality of the musicians.&quot; Pellowe adds something the truth of which matters less than the fact that he feels it: &quot;Valerie may disagree with this but I think he saw his recording career as more important than his concert conducting career. A studio is a studio, and Solti understood what that meant.&quot; Pellowe would record with Solti in Kingsway Hall in Holborn, &quot;a scruffy old place he loved to work in&quot;, and the Sofiensaal in Vienna, &quot;an old swimming pool boarded over to make a dusty old ballroom, with a lovely acoustic, though a little small for Wagner&quot;. With his team, Solti established a system of recording with what Pellowe calls &quot;the Decca tree&quot; of three omni-directional microphones 10ft 6in above ground to capture the sweep of the sound as it flew over the conductor&apos;s head, then more directional mics to spotlight the woodwind and the back of the orchestra. &quot;We used fewer mics than our competitors but I think to greater effect,&quot; he says. Recordings were made, Pellowe recalls, in &quot;long sessions, whole movements \u2013 not little slices like some conductors. Solti would play it back, listen while marking up his score, and go back to do some sections again.&quot; But there was a human element to this: &quot;Solti would talk directly to me, unlike most others. It was not the common situation, where you have the conductor talking to the producers who then relay the information. Solti consulted everybody; it was a team effort, and Solti was part of that team. And when it was done, he&apos;d throw parties for all of us. No one was taken for granted. That&apos;s what made it special, and that&apos;s how he was the greatest influence on all our lives, certainly mine.&quot; Pellowe went on to devise the revolutionary &quot;constellation system&quot;, the creation of an electronic &quot;stage shell&quot; around an orchestra playing in a vast or outdoor arena but hearing itself as though in a perfect acoustic setting. He concludes: &quot;Whatever I do is the legacy of working with Solti.&quot; With its origins in an orchestra assembled at Buckingham Palace for Solti&apos;s 80th birthday in 1992, and a project at Carnegie Hall bringing together musicians from the conservatoires of America, the World Orchestra for Peace staged its first concert in 1995 in Geneva to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. But the timing could not have been more horribly ironic: Solti conducted a fine performance for the UN members and secretary-general Boutros-Boutros Ghali. Just a few days later, only an hour&apos;s flight from Geneva, UN soldiers delivered the people of their own UN-declared &quot;safe area&quot; of Srebrenica to execution squads under the command of General Ratko Mladic, currently on trial for genocide, and looked on as 8,000 men and boys were taken to be summarily massacred by Bosnian Serbs. The international peace orchestra fared better than the organisation it celebrated. It was, says Lady Solti, &quot;a notion that some thought untenable at first until Solti turned round during the first rehearsal and said: &apos;It works!&apos; From that moment it became a gathering of the best and most committed orchestral players in the world.&quot; It performed \u2013 among many other extraordinary concerts \u2013 Mahler&apos;s 5th Symphony under Gergiev at Krakow to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. And next month the orchestra marks Solti&apos;s birth in 1912. The concert takes place in Chicago rather than Solti&apos;s birthplace of Budapest but includes Concerto for Orchestra by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, the composer next to whose grave Solti is himself buried. Clarinettist Larry Combs and horn player Gail Williams are husband and wife, and play for both the Chicago Symphony and World Orchestra for Peace. &quot;It&apos;s such a thrill to play with the best of the best from all over the world,&quot; says Combs. &quot;I sit next to a man called Viktor Kulik in the clarinet section \u2013 I speak no Russian, he speaks no English, with only the music to communicate \u2013 so that we understand each other perfectly!&quot; Combs recalls: &quot;When we started, no one thought an orchestra of people who did not know each other could work at this level of quality \u2013 but it does, equally well with Gergiev as it did with Solti.&quot; His wife, Gail Williams, says of Solti: &quot;It&apos;s one thing to be a talented musician, as many are today, but they don&apos;t have a plan, like Mr Solti did. He had this bigger picture beyond the symphony or the opera itself. I was young when I joined, and he infused me with the greater colours of sound and his rhythmical integrity \u2013 he was like a metronome. He said what he thought and wanted, and made us think about that bigger musical plan. And his expectations were high: he had not only learned the piece before we first sat down to work but lived with it \u2013 and he demanded of us to have done the same.&quot; During the months leading up to his sudden death in 1997, BBC&apos;s Omnibus programme made a serendipitously important film with and about Solti. It is charged with poignant exuberance rather than sadness; it bursts with Solti&apos;s wise effervescence, even in old age, perhaps especially in old age, as he returns to face the country he had left. Solti reflects and talks his way through a visit of homage to his grandparents&apos; grave, a performance of music by children from his home village in the presence of its young mayor; he walks the corridors \u2013 and revisits students in the practice room \u2013 of his alma mater, the Liszt Academy. And he sits, at the programme&apos;s end, on a bench looking over Lake Balaton where he swam as a child. He died a few weeks later. He is buried in Hungary, and the inscription on his grave is one word: &quot;Hazat&quot; (&quot;has come home&quot;).", "publicationDate": "2012-09-08T23:05:39Z", "title": "Georg Solti: the making of a musical colossus", "sentences": ["In February 1965 the Hungarian director of the Royal Opera House \u2013 emerging as incontestably the greatest conductor of his generation \u2013 flew to Tel Aviv to lead a series of performances by the Israel Philharmonic."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/09/georg-solti-centenary-lady-valerie"}, {"tags": ["Venice film festival 2012", "Film", "Culture", "Venice film festival", "Paul Thomas Anderson", "Philip Seymour Hoffman", "Terrence Malick", "Pieta"], "article": "The Master was mastered on the closing night of the 69th Venice film festival as an explosive tale of poverty and violence from South Korea upset the favourites to claim top prize.

The Master, Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s acclaimed epic about a religious cult in post-war America, had to be content with secondary Silver Lion award for best direction, although its major spoils may be yet to come. Taking its name from Michelangelo&apos;s statue of Mary cradling the body of Christ, Pieta is an anguished religious allegory, focusing on the antics of a brutish loan-shark (Lee Jung-jin) and the woman who arrives out of nowhere, claiming to be his long-lost mother. Refusing to believe her, the loan shark promptly severs his own toe and orders the woman to eat it as a test of her love.

As well as the deployment of active defence systems against incoming missiles, the distribution of gas masks, provision of bomb shelters and the testing of public information systems have accelerated. In recent months, there has been an increase in demand for gas masks and inquiries about bomb shelters in parallel with the rising rhetoric emanating from the prime minister&apos;s office. But many citizens remain sceptical: participation in civil defence drills, for example, remains low. Danny Avram, the owner of a bomb shelter construction and renovation firm, Ani Mugan (&quot;I Am Protected&quot;), said inquiries had increased tenfold over the past three weeks, although actual orders of work had only doubled. &quot;The last few weeks have been very intense,&quot; he said. &quot;There has been more talk, and the possibility has seemed more realistic to people. This happens every time something significant happens in the news. Bad news is good for business.&quot; The distribution of gas masks to civilians has risen month by month since the spring. According to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), 17,573 kits were distributed in April, 38,775 in May, 41,242 in June and around 70,000 in July. But at least 40% of the 7.8 million population is still without a &quot;personal protection kit&quot;. Yoav Cohen, of the military equipment firm Hagor, said the government was short of 3m gas masks, which he said would take months to manufacture. Expectation of an imminent Israeli strike has been tempered in recent days by suggestions that President Barack Obama may be preparing to clarify the &quot;red lines&quot; set by Washington regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, beyond which the US will take action. Some observers believe that the intention of the Israeli rhetoric has all along been to force the US to take a more robust position. However, others point to Netanyahu&apos;s lack of trust in the Obama administration and belief that Israel must be self-reliant in safeguarding its existential interests. Officials say that reinforcement of homeland defence measures are necessary, regardless of the possibility of war in the coming months. An official commission of inquiry into the war with Lebanon in 2006 found serious deficiencies in home front defence. The commission&apos;s chairman, the former supreme court judge Eliyahu Winograd, this week questioned whether the country had learned sufficient lessons for the possible war ahead. &quot;We can expect a rain of missiles from all directions and I don&apos;t know how well the home front is prepared,&quot; he said. But according to Yechiel Kuperstein, who was head of the home front command&apos;s physical protection unit during the last war, &quot;the level of awareness is much higher than it was during 2006. If we faced the same level of threat, we would be OK. But the threat is going to be completely different, from another scale. Then the only thing you can do is cover the population with concrete.&quot; Israel&apos;s military intelligence chief, Major General Aviv Kochavi, told a conference this year that an estimated 200,000 missiles and rockets were aimed at Israel and could be deployed by Iran&apos;s allies in the event of a war. The military says they include at least 60,000 missiles located in Lebanon and controlled by Hezbollah, plus thousands more in Syria and Gaza. The number of missiles in Iranian hands is unknown. These missiles are expected to reach further than before, with Tel Aviv expected to be a major target, along with cities, towns and small communities closer to the borders with Lebanon and Gaza. Even so, Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, has suggested the number of Israeli casualties is unlikely to exceed 500. &quot;There is no way to prevent some damage,&quot; he said last November. &quot;It will not be pleasant. There is no scenario for 50,000 dead, or 5,000 killed \u2013 and if everyone stays in their homes, maybe not even 500 dead.&quot; Israel has a government ministry devoted to home front defence. Its head is Avi Dichter, a former head of the internal security agency, Shin Bet, who was appointed last month. Netanyahu said at the time: &quot;We&apos;re investing billions in protecting the home front. We&apos;re updating our early warning systems and our civil defence systems\u00a0\u2026 as well as other forms of protection.&quot; The Israeli military also has a home front command, created 20 years ago following the Gulf war, aimed at &quot;protecting and informing the citizen population&quot;. The government has reinforced underground bunkers in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, to which key personnel will relocate in the event of war. Defence plans \u2022 Missile defence The Iron Dome mobile anti-missile system has been deployed by Israel to intercept rockets fired from Gaza since April 2011, with a claimed 80% success rate. Israel has four Iron Dome batteries, which are mobile, and two further batteries are expected to be operational in the near future. Last year, the US contributed more than $200m (\u00a3126m) in funding for and development of the Iron Dome system. The Arrow anti-ballistic missile defence system is designed to intercept long-range surface-to-air missiles. Arrow III is in development. \u2022 Bomb shelters All new buildings, both residential and commercial, constructed in Israel in the past 20 years have been required by law to include shelters. Around 30% of homes are estimated to have a reinforced safe room, but an estimated 25% of the population have no easy access to a bomb shelter. Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second largest city but one that is likely to be the main target of incoming missiles, has designated 60 underground spaces, mostly car parks, to act as emergency public shelters in the event of war. The city has 240 official public bomb shelters, capable of holding 40,000 people \u2013 around 10% of Tel Aviv&apos;s population. The northern city of Haifa, within reach of missiles from Lebanon, is planning to use an underground road tunnel as an emergency shelter. The IDF&apos;s home front command website includes advice to families to designate a secure space or room within their home of at least five square metres. \u2022 Public alerts Last month, Israel conducted a week-long trial of an SMS missile warning system for civilians. Alerts in four languages \u2013 Hebrew, Arabic, English and Russian \u2013 were sent to mobile phones. In the event of war, text messages will contain &quot;location-specific warnings based on the trajectory of rockets or missiles&quot;, according to the IDF. Public alerts and information are also expected to be issued by television stations operating from emergency studios. \u2022 Evacuation The home front ministry has discussed plans for the mass evacuation of civilians in cities in northern and central Israel to the Red Sea resort of Eilat and the southern desert area of Arava, according to Israeli media reports. Schools and hotels would be requisitioned, along with the provision of tents and caravans, to accommodate evacuees. The former home front minister Matan Vilnai said in June: &quot;I have spoken to council heads in the Eilat district and they appreciate the importance of hosting residents of central and northern Israel at times of emergency.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-09-10T06:35:44Z", "title": "Israel's defence plans reinforced against possible Iranian counterattack", "sentences": ["These missiles are expected to reach further than before, with Tel Aviv expected to be a major target, along with cities, towns and small communities closer to the borders with Lebanon and Gaza.", "The government has reinforced underground bunkers in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, to which key personnel will relocate in the event of war.", "Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second largest city but one that is likely to be the main target of incoming missiles, has designated 60 underground spaces, mostly car parks, to act as emergency public shelters in the event of war.", "The city has 240 official public bomb shelters, capable of holding 40,000 people \u2013 around 10% of Tel Aviv&apos;s population."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/israel-defence-plans-reinforced"}, {"tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "TV: Parade&apos;s End HBO&apos;s fruitful partnership with Auntie shows few signs of slowing, with this polished adaptation of Ford Madox Ford&apos;s clutch of first world war-set novels receiving similar levels of acclaim to that of previous co-productions such as Rome and Band Of Brothers.

Interviewer David Gregory called him the &quot;leader of the Jewish people&quot;. That&apos;s certainly how the Israeli prime minister would like to see himself, and he wouldn&apos;t be the first. Israeli leaders have long claimed the mantle of voice of the Jewish people around the world and protector of the Diaspora. Part of that is rooted in the idea of Israel as a safe haven, and the desire of every Israeli government to draw in new citizens. A few years back, Ariel Sharon tried to tell Jews in France that they were so persecuted they needed to move to Israel for their own protection. This at a time when Hamas and Islamic Jihad were blowing innocents to pieces in Jerusalem restaurants and on Tel Aviv buses. There was no rush to the El Al flight from Paris.  But there is also the global aspect. Netanyahu stood before the United Nations last year and claimed to speak for hundreds of generations of Jews across the world. It was an attempt to elevate himself above a mere political leader to claim to represent the full weight of Jewish suffering in justifying his government&apos;s stance towards the Palestinians. Gregory&apos;s slip \u2013 he later corrected himself by tweeting that it would be better to call Netanyahu the leader of Jewish state \u2013 was revealing of a mindset in certain sections of the American press that has a hard time dealing with the fact that Israel&apos;s prime minister might not be the leader of an entire people, but just another politician less worried about the common good than shoring up his power. That was where Meet the Press was revealing on a second point. It threw up evidence of just how successful Netanyahu has been at putting his political interests before those of Israel&apos;s future, which should lie in keeping the ever-dimming prospect of a two-state solution alive. There wasn&apos;t a single mention of the Palestinians during the 15 minute interview. Gregory didn&apos;t ask about them, and Netanyahu didn&apos;t talk about them. Thus the fate of several million people living under varying degrees of an occupation that continues to plunder land, maintain discriminatory laws and administrative procedures \u2013 such as rationing water to Arab villages while their neighbors in the Jewish settlements have unlimited supplies \u2013 remains in limbo. Netanyahu&apos;s government, meanwhile, pays lip service to the creation of a Palestinian state while pursuing policies intended to stave off the day of its birth. Just last week, the prime minister moved to expand 40 West Bank settlements built on land confiscated illegally \u2013 Israel admits it was illegal \u2013 from Palestinians by military order. Hardly the actions of a man or a government that only wants peace, as is so often claimed. As prime minister, Netanyahu&apos;s great achievement, as he would see it, is to have made the Palestinians all but invisible \u2013 first at home, and then abroad. Locked behind the land-grabbing West Bank barrier and caged in the Gaza strip, Palestinians have all but ceased to touch the lives of most Israelis. The occupation no longer demands an exacting price, so far as many Israelis are concerned. Yes, there is the inconvenience of military service; and there are unseen costs, such as financing the settlement project. But on the whole, Netanyahu has enabled Israelis to pretty much forget about the Palestinians if they choose to. And many do. Now, the Israeli leader has made the Palestinians disappear from the international stage, too, with the &quot;will he, won&apos;t he&quot; drama of threatening to bomb Iran. Three years ago, Netanyahu was humiliated by Barack Obama with a public scolding to stop settlement expansion. Even a year ago, the Palestinian bid for statehood at the UN at least put the issue on the agenda, even if Washington sided with Israel by strong-arming members of the security council into blocking it. In two weeks, the Palestinians return to the UN to try again on recognition, this time with the general assembly. But, as Meet the Press showed, there&apos;s not much talk of that while Netanyahu draws Washington&apos;s energies into trying to prevent him from attacking Iran before the US election. Whether he ever meant to is open to debate. But the effect has been clear. When the Israeli prime minister was last in Washington, there was barely a mention of the Palestinians after his meeting with Obama. And barely a word was breathed about the Palestinians at this year&apos;s meeting of the most influential of the pro-Israel lobby groups in Washington, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). The focus was firmly on Iran. Netanyahu has everyone where he wants them. The Palestinians behind the wire and most of the rest of the world looking the other way. \u2022 Commenting will be open for 24 hours on this article and may be closed overnight \u2022 Editor&apos;s note: on first publication, because of an editing error, this article referred to &quot;Hamas and Islamic jihads&quot;.

In an attempt to save his campaign from ruin, Romney went on the Republican-friendly Fox News network just as the rightwing Drudge Report published excerpts from a 1998 tape showing Barack Obama favouring &quot;redistribution&quot;. The apparently co-ordinated attempt to stem the crisis from the video, published on the Mother Jones website, followed a stumbling press conference on Monday night in which Romney tried to defend comments made at a fundraiser in Florida. A second clip was released on Tuesday in which Romney is heard setting out his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, claiming the Palestinians are not interested in peace.  Asked on Fox News if he had &quot;kissed half the electorate goodbye&quot; with the comments, Romney said: &quot;I&apos;m talking about the perspective of voters who I&apos;m not likely to get to support me. Those who are dependent on government, and those who think government&apos;s job is to redistribute \u2026 I&apos;m not going to get them.&quot; He acknowledged that some people do not pay income tax \u2013 the figure is actually 46% \u2013 for good reason: &quot;There are a number of retirees, members of the military who aren&apos;t paying taxes and that&apos;s as it should be. &quot;I think people would like to be paying taxes. The problem is that so many people have fallen into poverty that they&apos;re not paying taxes, [and] they&apos;re relying on government.&quot;            The revelations, which have forced the Romney campaign on to the defensive for the second week in succession, were met with dismay from conservative commentators and strategists, with one influential editor describing Romney&apos;s views as &quot;stupid&quot;. His campaign team, with their candidate already trailing Barack Obama after a long list of self-inflicted gaffes over the summer, is anxiously awaiting the next batch of polls to see the extent of the fallout. The video was shot during an hour-long appearance by Romney in May at a $50,000-a-head fund-raising dinner at the Florida home of investment banker Marc Leder. More excerpts are being lined up for release, making it impossible for his campaign to dampen the firestorm and return to its core focus, the economy. The latest clip shows Romney dismissing the chances of peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not an unusual view, but he then goes on to firmly put the blame solely on the Palestinians. He contentiously described the the Palestinians as &quot;committed to the destruction and elimination&quot; of Israel and indicated he was unlikely to pursue, as president, the creation of a Palestinian state, warning that Iran would use it as a base for attacks on Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian excerpt can be easily brushed aside by the Romney campaign but the 47% excerpt which was released on Monday is harder to handle. Within the space of a few minutes, Romney managed to potentially offend the elderly, veterans, students, Latinos and other demographic groups, most of whom do, in fact, pay some taxes and have earned their entitlements.  In a remark that sounded especially callous from someone who claims that as president he would represent all Americans, he said: &quot;My job is not to worry about those people.&quot; One of the most destructive aspects of the video is the contrast between what he says in public and in private, opening him up to accusations of hypocrisy. The release of the video came only hours after the Romney team, struggling in the polls and repeatedly forced on the defensive by the Obama campaign team, had announced it was rebooting its campaign.  The new-look strategy, in which Romney was to set out specific policies rather than focusing on attacking Obama, barely lasted 12 hours before the video emerged and the Romney campaign team was again engaged in damage-control. The media coverage was almost entirely negative. The New York Daily News on its front page had the headline &quot;Mitt Hits The Fan&quot;. The Obama campaign was quick to jump on Romney&apos;s 47% remarks, with White House press secretary Jay Carney telling reporters on Tuesday that Obama was the president of all the people, not just those who voted for him. That was followed up with a new Obama campaign video in which footage from the 47% video was intercut with members of the public responding to it. &quot;I actually felt sick to my stomach,&quot; said one woman.  But it is the reaction of conservatives that will cause the Romney campaign the most concern. Some are labelling his election run as the most inept they have seen in half a century. The influential editor of the conservative Weekly Standard William Kristol described Romney&apos;s comments about the 47% as &quot;arrogant and stupid&quot; and hinted he should stand down in favour of his a ticket headed by his running mate Paul Ryan, with senator Marco Rubio as his vice-presidential candidate. Mark McKinnon, who was one of John McCain&apos;s campaign advisers in the 2008 campaign and one of the few Republican strategists to go on the record yesterday, told the Hill magazine: &quot;It&apos;s a kidney shot because it reveals a very cynical view. He&apos;s pushing independent voters out the door.&quot; He added that it could help motivate disgruntled Democrats into turning out in large numbers for the election. With seven weeks left, there is still time for Romney to turn it around, with the support of tens of millions of dollars in advertising and a good performance in the debates with Obama, the first scheduled for 3 October in Denver, Colorado. Romney, who was scheduled to hold fundraising events in Salt Lake City and Dallas on Tuesday, looked uncharacteristically haggard when he held an impromptu press conference on Monday night to deal with the 47% video and offered up a rambling defence. He said he had been speaking &quot;off the cuff&quot; and describing his comments as not &quot;elegantly stated&quot;. While Romney&apos;s views expressed in the new excerpt about the Palestinians are not a major surprise given his strong expression of support for the Israeli prime minister Binyanmin Netanyahu, US presidents like to portray themselves as neutral referees in the conflict, even if in fact they lean towards Israel. Romney has blown any lingering prospect of being seen as a neutral arbiter. &quot;I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel,&quot; he said. He suggested he would not actively engage in the promotion of a peace process, as his predecessors have done.  One of the reasons he said that it is difficult to allow the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank is that it could then become a base to which Iran and other Arab nations channel rockets and other weapons to threaten the Israeli financial capital Tel Aviv. Indicating he would not be pushing for a two-state solution, the creation of Palestine to stand alongside Israel, he said: &quot;All right, we have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.&quot; The Obama administration, apart from a few tentative attempts at the start of his presidency, has made no serious effort to resolve the conflict. The Obama administration has hinted that, free from the constraints of fighting another election, it might take a more robust approach to the issue in a second term. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2012.

Many of its employees face losing their jobs in the coming weeks. Ma&apos;ariv was founded in 1948, the same year as the state of Israel was declared, and was the country&apos;s largest circulation daily in the 1950s. Staff salaries have not been paid this month, and about 1,000 employees demonstrated in Tel Aviv on Thursday. A one-day strike is planned for early next week. The new owner, Shlomo Ben-Zvi, has said he will keep the paper going but with a much smaller workforce, pledging to retain only about 300 of the group&apos;s 1,500-plus employees. Ben-Zvi is also the publisher of Makor Rishon, a daily newspaper with a nationalist-religious outlook associated with the hardline settler movement, and there is speculation he could merge the two titles. The businessman, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Efrat, reportedly paid about $19m (\u00a312m) for a majority share in Ma&apos;ariv. Israel&apos;s newspaper industry has been hit by the migration of readers and advertising to the internet, and paid-for titles have had to contend with the success of the free newspaper Israel Hayom, which launched in 2007 and is now the country&apos;s most widely read paper, with a 38% market share. Israel Hayom is owned by the US billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a major donor to Mitt Romney&apos;s US presidential campaign. The paper is a strong supporter of Binyamin Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition government. It recently excised a reference to the prime minister as a &quot;scumbag&quot; from a letter written by Moshe Silman, an Israeli citizen who died after setting himself alight in protest over social and economic conditions. Other Israeli newspapers have been affected by Israel Hayom&apos;s rise.

Demonstrations in March 2011 were contained and protests since have been restricted to outlying areas - albeit in loyal East Bank heartlands such as Tafila and Ma&apos;an. Talk of reform has been accompanied by three changes of prime minister. King Abdullah&apos;s last one, Awn Khasawneh, resigned after complaints by the palace that he was not moving fast enough. The other view is that he was getting too cosy in talks with the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. So is Arab spring unrest about to hit the Hashemite kingdom? On Friday the IAF is organising a big rally under the resonant slogan &quot;Save the Homeland.&quot; Its target is the constitutional changes the king has approved in advance of parliamentary elections he says must be held by the end of the year \u2014 though the increasingly vocal IAF says the reforms are inadequate and insists it will boycott the polls. That would render them meaningless. The IAF has been emboldened by the successes of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Tunisia and by the prominent role it is playing in the uprising in Syria next door. Complicating matters, many of its supporters are Jordanians of Palestinian origin, always a sensitive issue, as is the peace treaty with Israel. The Obeidat, a large East Bank clan, has just disowned one of its members who has accepted the post of Jordanian ambassador to Tel Aviv. The king is under pressure from his western friends to respond convincingly to growing demands for change. Crucially, though, he plans to retain the power to appoint the prime minister and dismiss parliament at will. Overall the proposed new electoral system is still rigged in favour of regime supporters; Palestinian-Jordanians in particular will be significantly under-represented. Critics complain that reforms are more apparent than real. Talk has been rife of a showdown on Friday \u2014 and perhaps a violent one. Young thugs wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the king&apos;s image have been mobilised for a loyalist counter-demonstration and there are signs of an offically-inspired whispering campaign suggesting that the IAF will call on Abdullah to surrender power. It insists it is doing no such thing. The popular slogan the &quot;people demand the fall of the regime&quot; has barely been heard in the Hashemite kingdom. In recent months there has been widespread unease because of the crisis in Syria, a serious financial squeeze, a row over the removal of fuel subsidies and anger about new restrictions on the internet. The once iron-clad taboo on criticism of the royal court has been eroded. The IAF rally is to be held on the familiar &quot;safety-valve&quot; route from the al-Hussein mosque in downtown Amman to nearby al-Nakhil square. Loyalists were planning to oppose it under the banner of &quot;Alleigance and Belonging.&quot; Several well-known Jordanian commentators have suggested that the government was seeking a confrontation with the opposition. According to the latest reports from Amman that counter-demonstration is now to be re-scheduled. That would help avoid a potentially dangerous clash \u2014 even if Jordan&apos;s underlying tensions remain. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012 because the original said King Abdullah of Jordan sacked the country&apos;s last prime minister, Awn Khasawneh.", "publicationDate": "2012-10-04T14:38:00Z", "title": "Is Jordan about to experience its first big moment of the Arab spring?", "sentences": ["The Obeidat, a large East Bank clan, has just disowned one of its members who has accepted the post of Jordanian ambassador to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2012/oct/04/jordan-abdullah-arab-spring"}, {"tags": ["Media", "Newspapers", "Israel", "Media downturn", "Media business", "Digital media", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Newspaper closures", "New York Times"], "article": "One of Israel&apos;s leading newspapers, Maariv, is on the verge of closing, reports the New York Times. It is said to have lost its fierce contest with the country&apos;s largest seller, Yediot Aharonot.  Another title, Haaretz - regarded as the flagship broadsheet of Israel&apos;s left-wing intelligentsia - is also under threat of closure. Last Thursday, it wasn&apos;t published for the first time in three decades after editorial staff held a one-day strike to protest at cutbacks.  Publisher Amos Schocken responded by raised the spectre of closing the paper if his employees do not accept the business reality. The problems of Maariv and Haaretz are symbolic of the global print media crisis in the face of the digital revolution. But there are specific internal reasons for the dramas, most obviously the relatively small size of the Israeli media market and the fact that it is so crowded. That is especially true of the Hebrew-language market. Israeli media commentators argue that print media economics have been skewed by the arrival five years ago of Israel Hayom, a free national newspaper that has built up the largest weekday distribution of any Hebrew paper.  It is owned by Sheldon Adelson, an American billionaire who is a staunch supporter of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.  The management of Maariv is now in the hands of court-appointed trustees after its owner could no longer afford to cover its losses. A sale is pending to Shlomo Ben-Zvi, an Israeli who publishes a right-leaning newspaper called Makor Rishon. Even if the sale to Ben-Zvi goes through he has said he will retain only about 300 of Maariv&apos;s 2,000 employees in order to keep Maariv&apos;s website going and perhaps publish the newspaper in a limited format.  Aware that the company does not have the money to pay all their compensation and pensions, Maariv employees have staged protests in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Though analysts claim Maariv has lost its identity by trying to mimic Yediot Aharonot, it fills a distinctive niche. &quot;Israel without Haaretz would be like Israel without the supreme court,&quot; said Uzi Benziman, a former Haaretz columnist and now editor of an online journal dealing with Israeli media issues. &quot;It is not surprising that Maariv is the first to go,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not sure it will be the last.&quot; Maariv was founded in 1948, the year Israel became a state, by disgruntled journalists at Yediot Aharonot who walked out in a dispute over work conditions and journalistic principles.  In its first two decades, Maariv was regarded as the most widely read newspaper in Israel and the most connected with the political, economic and social elite.  Its decline began in the 1970s, according to Rafi Mann, who worked at the newspaper for nearly 30 years and now teaches journalism. He said the editors of Yediot Aharonot &quot;understood the social revolution taking place in Israel,&quot; while Maariv &quot;did not read the social map of Israel well.&quot; Source: New York Times", "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T11:12:43Z", "title": "Israel's Maariv 'on verge of closure'", "sentences": ["Aware that the company does not have the money to pay all their compensation and pensions, Maariv employees have staged protests in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/06/newspapers-israel"}, {"tags": ["Mitt Romney", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "US news", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Obama administration", "US elections 2012"], "article": "Mitt Romney&apos;s pledge &quot;to use America&apos;s great power to shape history&quot; is likely to be applauded by those in Israel who interpret it as getting tough with Iran. But any indication that interventionism could extend to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be much less welcome. Romney&apos;s message to Israel was that the US under his leadership would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its ally, and that the evident personal warmth and ideological similarities between him and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu would be in marked contrast to Obama&apos;s distance and chilliness. &quot;The relationship between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains,&quot; said Romney. &quot;The president explicitly stated that his goal was to put &apos;daylight&apos; between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.&quot; Later he added: &quot;I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security \u2013 the world must never see any daylight between our two nations.&quot; Some of this is deceptive electioneering. Despite the acute tension between Obama and Netanyahu over the Iranian nuclear programme, the current president has also frequently reaffirmed the historic ties between the two allies, continued a policy of unswerving commitment to Israel&apos;s security, threatened to use the US veto against the Palestinians at the United Nations and pumped billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. But &quot;daylight&quot; on the Iran issue undoubtedly exists, especially around the issue of &quot;red lines&quot; which, if crossed, would trigger US military action. Obama has resisted Netanyahu&apos;s pressure to define any red lines. Yet Romney&apos;s speech also failed to meet this demand, pointed out Tel Aviv-based analyst Meir Javedanfar. In his speech, Romney pledged to &quot;put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability&quot;. Obama has repeatedly done the same. Romney went on: &quot;I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region \u2013 and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions \u2013 not just words \u2013 that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.&quot; Iranian-born Javedanfar said: &quot;There are two words he didn&apos;t say: red line. But he also didn&apos;t say he would continue with diplomacy. If Romney stopped talking to the Iranians, it would be very difficult to legitimise new sanctions, and very difficult to keep the Russians and Chinese on board.&quot; Romney&apos;s promise to impose new sanctions and enhance the US military presence in the region were not impressive, said Javedanfar. &quot;There are going to be new sanctions anyway. US forces are already stationed in Qata, and the fifth fleet is in Bahrain,&quot; he said, dismissing Romney&apos;s pledges as &quot;cosmetic&quot;. Towards the end of his speech, Romney clarified his position on Israeli-Palestinian conflict. &quot;I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the president has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.&quot; This brief statement was an attempt to repair damage caused by the release of video-recorded comments made by the Republican candidate at a fundraising event in May. Then he accused the Palestinians of having no interest in peace and suggested the world needed to learn to live with this &quot;unsolved problem&quot;. &apos;Obama has been no more nor less effective than Bush&apos; Despite suggesting only a new president could solve an old conflict, Romney&apos;s speech offered nothing fresh, said independent Palestinian analyst Mouin Rabbani. &quot;This sounds like what Obama said about his predecessor&quot;. He went on: &quot;We&apos;ve got to the point where we&apos;re best off not taking seriously any public statements from the US, but rather with a hefty grain of salt. Obama is committed to a negotiated two-state settlement but in practice has done absolutely nothing to promote this framework. Instead the US has used virtually all the instruments in its power to stop it \u2026 and US support for Israel is becoming more uncritical and unconditional.&quot; Asked if it would make any difference to the Palestinian cause if the world wakes up to a Romney presidency on November 7, Rabbani said: &quot;I woke up four years ago to an Obama presidency, and I&apos;ve stayed awake since. If you can identify a substantial difference between Obama and his predecessors, I&apos;d be very eager to hear it. &quot;If we are genuinely interested in peace in the Middle East, our first priority must be to get past the framework of a US-sponsored bilaterally-negotiated settlement. The US monopoly on this must be challenged. We need to find a different approach in which we don&apos;t rely on the US.&quot; Mark Heller of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University said Obama had indeed failed to advance the goal of a Palestinian state living side by side with an Israeli state, but so had his predecessors, and so probably would Romney. &quot;The question is: has Obama managed to promote that objective? And the answer is: no, he hasn&apos;t. But you could say that about every previous American president and probably every future one, too. &quot;Too many people over-estimate the power of a US president. Obama has been no more nor less effective than Bush, Clinton or Bush senior. &quot;The US has a significant and probably indispensable role to play when the circumstances are right. But the circumstances now are not favourable to active and productive US intervention. &quot;If Romney wins the election, there may be less friction between him and Netanyahu. But fundamentally, I&apos;m not sure it makes that much difference. It&apos;s true there have been serious contretemps between Obama and Netanyahu, but fundamentally Obama has stood by Israel in his first term. I don&apos;t think a Romney presidency would be fundamentally different or better.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T17:50:43Z", "title": "Romney on foreign policy: view from Israel and the Palestinian territories", "sentences": ["Yet Romney&apos;s speech also failed to meet this demand, pointed out Tel Aviv-based analyst Meir Javedanfar.", "We need to find a different approach in which we don&apos;t rely on the US.&quot; Mark Heller of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University said Obama had indeed failed to advance the goal of a Palestinian state living side by side with an Israeli state, but so had his predecessors, and so probably would Romney."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-foreign-policy-israel-palestinian"}, {"tags": ["Franz Kafka", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Carried out of Prague in a suitcase in 1939 and kept hidden for decades, a huge collection of documents by Franz Kafka and his friend Max Brod is set to be made public for the first time following a ruling by a Tel Aviv judge. The long-running trial over the ownership of the manuscripts came to a conclusion on Sunday, when judge Talia Kopelman-Pardo ruled in Tel Aviv that the collection should be handed to the Israeli National Library in Jerusalem. The library has said that it will publish the documents, which run to tens of thousands of pages and include notebooks of Kafka&apos;s writing, online. Kafka left his writing to his friend Max Brod on his death in 1924, ordering him to burn it. Instead, Brod released the novels \u2013 The Castle, The Trial and Amerika \u2013 which would make Kafka one of the greatest literary names of the 20th century. Much of the author&apos;s work remained unpublished, however, and Brod eventually fled Europe in 1939 for Palestine, carrying a suitcase filled with Kafka&apos;s manuscripts. On his death, Brod bequeathed his archive \u2013 which includes Brod&apos;s diary, Kafka&apos;s notebooks and letters - to his secretary Esther Hoffe, who sold part of it, and left it to her daughters when she died in 2007. They have argued that the collection, kept in safes in Tel Aviv and Zurich, was a gift, and were backed by the German Literature Archive, which wished to purchase the collection. But Kopelman-Pardo ruled that &quot;the Kafka manuscripts, like the Brod estate, were not given to the plaintiffs as gifts&quot;, and &quot;should be handed to the archive&quot;, as Brod&apos;s 1948 will stipulated that his archive should go to &quot;the library of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem or the Tel Aviv municipal library, or (that of) any other public institution in Israel or abroad&quot;. &quot;This case complicated by passions, was argued in court for quite a long time across seas, lands, and times. Not every day, and most definitely not as a matter of routine, does the opportunity befall a judge to delve into the depth of history as it unfolds before him in piecemeal fashion,&quot; Kopelman-Pardo wrote in her ruling, saying that the trial provided &quot;a window into the lives, desires, frustrations and the souls of two of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century&quot;. Israeli National Library director Oren Weinberg welcomed the decision and said the collection would be put online, &quot;thus fulfilling Brod&apos;s wish of publishing Kafka&apos;s writings for all literature lovers in Israel and the world&quot;. Aviad Stollman, curator of Judaica at the library, said: &quot;These papers have been concealed for more than forty years, and we are satisfied that they will now become available for research and viewing. In view of the role of the library to collect, preserve and make accessible the cultural treasures of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, we see this as a great success&quot;. Eva Hoffe, Esther Hoffe&apos;s surviving daughter, has said she will appeal the decision. Kafka experts gave the ruling cautious praise. &quot;It is certainly good news that these materials are to be publicly accessible. So long as they are available, especially online, it does not much matter where they are physically located,&quot; said Oxford University professor Ritchie Robertson. &quot;Like others, I doubt if much significant material by Kafka himself will emerge; if it were there, it would surely have been made known long before now. But his Hebrew notebooks will at least tell us more about his language studies. And Max Brod&apos;s diaries will be of great interest. They may tell us more about Kafka (though Brod already quoted from them a lot in his biographical writings on Kafka) and they will certainly tell us about the social and intellectual milieu of early-20th-century Prague in which Kafka matured.&quot; Booker-shortlisted novelist Will Self was less excited. &quot;There&apos;s enough of what Milan Kundera terms &apos;Kafkaology&apos; about as it is: seldom has a writer been as profitlessly anatomised \u2013 and that largely as a function of writings other than his fiction \u2013 as Kafka. This evolution will surely result only in more of this: more unread and unreadable doctoral theses, more bowdlerised applications of this or that critical theory to the Kafka corpus,&quot; he said. &quot;Brod himself was intent on canonising Kafka as a Zionist saint, and the Israeli state holding the papers ensures that this falsification will continue apace \u2013 still, it matters not, the works are out there in all their contrariety, sparking different and heterodox sensations as legion as their readers.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T11:35:00Z", "title": "Huge Franz Kafka archive to be made public", "sentences": ["Carried out of Prague in a suitcase in 1939 and kept hidden for decades, a huge collection of documents by Franz Kafka and his friend Max Brod is set to be made public for the first time following a ruling by a Tel Aviv judge.", "The long-running trial over the ownership of the manuscripts came to a conclusion on Sunday, when judge Talia Kopelman-Pardo ruled in Tel Aviv that the collection should be handed to the Israeli National Library in Jerusalem.", "They have argued that the collection, kept in safes in Tel Aviv and Zurich, was a gift, and were backed by the German Literature Archive, which wished to purchase the collection.", "But Kopelman-Pardo ruled that &quot;the Kafka manuscripts, like the Brod estate, were not given to the plaintiffs as gifts&quot;, and &quot;should be handed to the archive&quot;, as Brod&apos;s 1948 will stipulated that his archive should go to &quot;the library of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem or the Tel Aviv municipal library, or (that of) any other public institution in Israel or abroad&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/franz-kafka-archive-public"}, {"tags": ["England Under-21s", "Stuart Pearce", "Sport", "Football"], "article": "Stuart Pearce is desperate to block book a set of airline tickets to Israel next June but partying on Tel Aviv&apos;s beaches, sight-seeing in Jerusalem and rejuvenation by the Dead Sea are the last things on his mind.

If Pearce&apos;s current crop can overcome Serbia in the second leg of a play-off in the central Serbian city of Krusevac on Tuesday evening they will qualify for the 2013 European Under-21 Championship in Israel. The plan is that the attendant experience of learning to be &quot;good tourists&quot; amid intense competition, and Middle Eastern heat, will prove ideal preparation for those Under-21s expected to graduate to Roy Hodgson&apos;s senior side in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The good news is that England hold a 1-0 lead from last week&apos;s first leg at Carrow Road. Less positively, the atmosphere will be hostile and Pearce&apos;s side are weakened by injuries, a situation exacerbated when Manchester City&apos;s Jack Rodwell returned to the Etihad Stadium over the weekend after complaining of a tight hamstring. &quot;We&apos;re disappointed for Jack but I know what I&apos;ve got in this squad and I know they&apos;re good enough to see the job through,&quot; said Pearce. &quot;We&apos;ve had a lot of injuries to contend with throughout this qualification campaign so it&apos;s not a challenge we&apos;re unfamiliar with. I know my players and I&apos;m no less confident in our chances.&quot; Much will be expected of two individuals struggling to get a game for their clubs.

With Serbia renowned as physically daunting opponents the evening will represent a big test for Pearce&apos;s creative talents, including Liverpool&apos;s Raheem Sterling, Crystal Palace&apos;s Wilfried Zaha, Josh McEachran, the Chelsea midfielder on loan at Middlesbrough, and Blackpool&apos;s Tom Ince. It will be intriguing to see who, out of that quartet, starts and who begins on the bench. &quot;Serbia were very physical so we know it will be tough,&quot; said Jack Butland, the Birmingham City goalkeeper whose clean sheet last Friday could prove invaluable in front of a 14,000 sell out crowd at the Miadost Stadium, home of Serbian First League side FK Napradek. &quot;We&apos;re a goal up and they&apos;ve not got an away goal so it was a job well done on Friday. We know that if we don&apos;t concede we&apos;re through, but we intend to score on Tuesday.&quot; The Under-21s have not conceded a goal in four games since last November, when they lost 2-1 to Belgium, and Henderson is confident they can extend this impressive run. &quot;We&apos;re playing some good stuff at the moment,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone&apos;s enjoying it but we know we&apos;ve got to be up for it. It&apos;s good to come to places like this where you wouldn&apos;t normally go on holiday and see the world in a different way \u2013 although we know we&apos;re not here for sightseeing.&quot; One thing Pearce&apos;s players have done at their base in Nis is watch Felix Baumgartner break the sound barrier courtesy of his world-record breaking freefall dive on Sunday.

Following every flare-up, pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protesters mass in front of the Israeli embassy in Kensington. Pro-Israeli demonstrators rally in Trafalgar Square. So ritualistic have such practices become, it&apos;s practically impossible to imagine how these two sides might reconcile. The situation is compounded by the tendency of activists to swallow feelings of ambivalence in the pursuit of polarised forms of &quot;solidarity&quot; that eschew doubt. Many of those who demonstrate for Israel are privately horrified by Israeli actions, but hide their doubts because of fear of undermining Israel&apos;s security. Many of those who demonstrate against Israel are similarly concerned about the rise of fundamentalism in Islamic countries and among Palestinians. The heat of the conflict is particularly intense in diasporic London, riven as it is with activist organisations and exiled political communities, Jewish and Muslim, anti-colonial and anti-imperialist. Despite its diversity, politically speaking, &quot;London&quot; is practically a synonym for division. In the past year alone there have been repeated instances in which Israeli-Palestinian conflict inspired extremist forms of intolerance, widening further the Jewish-Muslim gap in the city. A series of violent clashes and incidents at the LSE earlier this year, for example, shocked many, forcing the university to reaffirm its commitment to fighting antisemitism and Islamophobia. But the prospect is not all doom and gloom. As proven in the joint Muslim-Jewish protests against Germany&apos;s circumcision ban, there is enough common ground for the communities to rise above their differences. To that end, there are a growing number of London-based organisations and initiatives, including Coexistence Trust, that actively seek to promote understanding between faiths. The need for a similar coalition between Iranians and Israelis is particularly telling at this juncture, when Israel&apos;s looming conflict with Iran risks deepening the divisions, but also offers an opportunity to break form. So useless and bloody is this conflict likely to be that there is a chance that previously partisan activists may begin to question their ingrained habits. There is little, ideologically, to defend, on either side of the political spectrum. Many pro-Israel activists balk at the recklessness of Netanyahu&apos;s desire for war. Many who have demonstrated against Israel do not wish to stand with a theocratic Iran that oppresses its own people, and is embroiled in the suppression of the Syrian revolt. On top of this, many Israelis and Iranians find few reasons to support their governments&apos; increasing closeness to war. Tens of thousands promise to be killed, in the name of what, exactly? Regional hegemony? It&apos;s hard to find anything attractive about that, considering the consequences. Similarly, an Israeli-Iranian war risks a near-apocalyptic conflagration that will strain already tenuous Jewish-Muslim-Christian relations to breaking point. This flies in the face of the deep commonalities between the Abrahamic faiths and the yearning of many for reconciliation \u2013 a desire that seems lost on the Israeli and Iranian political establishments, but not Iranians and Israelis. Iranian society still bears the scars of the eight-year war with Iraq (1980-88.) A second such devastating war would inflict far deeper wounds, complicating the country&apos;s psyche in many of the same ways that Israelis are familiar with, and can relate to. Israelis, similarly, would find it hard to differentiate Iranian military violence from any other they&apos;ve been subject to, including the Holocaust. We would like to propose that such a situation creates the possibility for Iranian-Jewish/Muslim-Jewish collaboration. A coalition can be built that rejects both Israeli and Iranian militarism and confrontation. Such a coalition would refuse the tired old position-taking and build a genuine peace movement in its place. This coalition would build on the work of interfaith and intercommunal dialogue and collaboration that already occurs in the UK \u2013 much of it under the radar. It would also be specifically British, drawing on the everyday &quot;culture of conviviality&quot; that its multicultural cities foster at their best. So far, interfaith and community activists in the UK have avoided such overtly political and public activity. It&apos;s time for them to step up the plate and show that it is possible to build a new kind of movement that refuses easy polarities, shows empathy and opposes militarism. It wouldn&apos;t be the first time that Iranians and Israelis attempted to join forces at a grassroots level.

So grave is the crisis in the Levant that it will go close to defining the success of the US president&apos;s second term \u2013 or Mitt Romney&apos;s first. If Obama was to be judged now on how he has dealt with the ever-worsening Syrian civil war, history would likely be harsh. The US has remained largely on the sidelines of the most violent episode of the Arab spring, shaping its response through the regional policy it laid down before the first stirrings of uprising in Tunisia. Soon after replacing George W Bush, Obama rubber-stamped the Republican president&apos;s policy shift, which pledged to recast the way the US dealt with the entrenched Arab world order. From 2006, Bush had said, the 50-year approach of favouring stability over democracy was to be turned on its head. Democracy was to be paramount. Stability, it was suggested, was to play second fiddle. Bush&apos;s resolve was barely put to the test, apart from some faltering steps towards nation-building in Iraq. Not so Obama. Almost everything about the first few heady months of the Arab spring spoke directly to the values Obama had first championed in his landmark 2009 address to the Arab world in Cairo: tyranny needed to defeated by self-determination, state repression trumped by accountability, violence checked by the rule of law. After rumbling through north Africa, the same themes soon took root in Syria, where they were confronted with a withering rearguard from the regime and its backers \u2013 primarily Iran and Hezbollah, as well as an old enemy, Russia. The US knew from the outset that this was to be no romp through the desert like Libya. After readily agreeing to send jets and missiles to bomb Gaddafi, Obama&apos;s administration has steadfastly refused to do the same to Bashar al-Assad. A soaring death count, the growing threat of regional spillover, expectations from Sunni allies that Washington take the lead in stemming the chaos, and rising belligerence from Tel Aviv to Tehran have done nothing to shift Obama. And nor will they as he fights the last three weeks of a presidential campaign fought largely on domestic issues and his belief that the US should no longer take a stake in all the world&apos;s core problems. A president who won office partly on getting out of giant misadventures in the Middle East clearly doesn&apos;t want to campaign on the merits of getting the US involved in another one. The US military, its institutions \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 have learned some key lessons from Iraq, especially the perils of taking a power stake in a sectarian state. Almost 10 years on from the second Iraq war, there is nothing to suggest that intervening in Syria would be any easier. Far from it. The vacuum that would follow the fall of Damascus would become a high-stakes contest for myriad players. Two of them, Hezbollah and Iran, have an enormous amount to lose if Assad is ousted. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have a lot to lose if he stays. Add to that the slowly growing presence of global jihadists, who for now remain a minority voice among an insurrection that started as a nationalistic push but is losing some ground to a sectarian agenda. Arming the rebel groups opposed to Assad remains fraught. Attempts by the US and Turkey to organise the many groups under a functional command haven&apos;t worked. Without that, a re-elected Obama is unlikely to change his first-term opposition to sending the heavy weapons that rebel fighters need to mount a serious threat to what remains of the regime&apos;s military. Obama spent much of his first term recalibrating what he deemed to be his national security interests. Filtered through the realpolitik of getting re-elected, Syria has remained in the too-hard tray with neither him or his inner court conceding that what is happening as the country crumbles directly affects the US. That position cannot last. Syria is perilously close to the abyss and its likely descent further will affect all corners of the region and far beyond. From the inauguration on, Syria will be central to the stage, along with its key backer, Iran. What to do about it will prove a defining chapter for US interests.", "publicationDate": "2012-10-22T06:00:00Z", "title": "Syria will be a defining issue of the next US presidency", "sentences": ["A soaring death count, the growing threat of regional spillover, expectations from Sunni allies that Washington take the lead in stemming the chaos, and rising belligerence from Tel Aviv to Tehran have done nothing to shift Obama."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/syria-defining-issue-us-presidency"}, {"tags": ["US presidential debates 2012", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics", "Democrats", "Republicans", "Drones (military)", "Afghanistan", "Iran", "Israel", "Iraq", "George Bush", "Egypt", "Muslim Brotherhood", "China", "Mitt Romney", "Barack Obama", "US economy", "US domestic policy", "World news"], "article": "Heather Hurlburt: &apos;Obama scored zinger after zinger&apos;      We heard a lot of talk right after Monday&apos;s foreign policy debate about Mitt Romney passing or not passing the &quot;commander-in-chief test&quot;. That may sound as if it means: can the public imagine him bayoneting Syrian President Assad while riding a horse, or ordering a military strike against Iran. But in the last weeks of a campaign, it means something much more specific. Romney has had either 18 months or five years, depending how you&apos;re counting, to introduce his commander-in-chief bona fides to the full range of American voters. In the final weeks of a close race, his task was a different one: convincing undecided and middle-of-the road voters, who seem, this cycle, to be disproportionately women, that he is a likeable, moderate guy with solutions to the problems they face. As I have written elsewhere, polling continues to find that women are less receptive to violence and conflict-based solutions to problems than men. They \u2013 as well as moderates \u2013 disproportionately prefer Obama&apos;s approach to national security policy. This is why &quot;last night&apos;s&quot; Mitt Romney used the word &quot;peace&quot; so many times, and was so anxious to agree with President Obama&apos;s plans to remove US troops from Afghanistan, refuse to send US troops to Syria and intervene militarily in Iran only as a last resort. But for this to work, Romney had to do more than hug Obama on substance and find smart-sounding attack lines. He needed to come up with positive alternatives: what is the Middle East policy that will get rid of the murderous Assad, convince Israelis and Palestinians to come to terms and provoke the Arab streets to love us? What should the next administration do about the magical opportunity he invoked in Latin America? What tools are there he can deploy that Obama does not have to convince Iran to drop its nuclear program? Commentators \u2013 and not just Democrats \u2013 have been hitting Romney on his lack of substance, since the spring. Bill Kristol, Peggy Noonan, Colin Powell, Danielle Pletka have all at various times suggested that his vague positions lacked seriousness. &quot;Think, Mitt,&quot; Powell pleaded after the &quot;Russia No 1 geopolitical foe&quot; comment. Romney had a run of misfortunes with his foreign policy outings: missteps on his Europe and Israel trip, criticism over politicization of the VMI speech venue, omission of Afghanistan and veterans from his convention speech. So, to come off seriously and successfully as a moderate, he needed to shut down Obama&apos;s critique of him. And here he failed. Obama scored zinger after zinger: a decade wants its military policy back \u2013 a military of cavalry and bayonets, and on and on. Effective responses were few and far between, which meant Romney was allowing Obama to fire up his own base and sow doubts in Romney&apos;s target audience. The insta-polls last night, whatever they may say about the race itself, reflected Romney&apos;s failure to move from a candidate with a critique to a leader with bullet-proof, or at least quip-proof, policy alternatives. The polls showed it; the dial-tests showed it; the pundit analyses showed it. Romney made a full run at Obama&apos;s dominance on national security, and didn&apos;t shake it. It remains to be seen how profound this impact is on the race, but the conventional wisdom about the politics of American national security, marked for three decades by progressives&apos; fear of conservative dominance and mockery, will never be the same. Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network James Antle: &apos;Romney tried to distance himself from George Bush&apos;      Both candidates were broadly in favor of a US foreign policy that includes or permits preventive war, drone attacks, untrammeled executive surveillance powers and &quot;crippling sanctions&quot; against Iran. Both insisted no option was off the table in dealing with Iran, a threat they both described in the same terms. Both supported regime change in Libya by US arms and in Egypt \u2013 though in the latter case, they would leave it up to the Egyptians themselves. Neither was specific about what kind of &quot;help&quot; they had in mind for Syrian rebels. Neither was willing to admit their policies might lead to direct American military involvement in the places where they were intervening. The only time the exchange between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney genuinely resembled a debate was when it veered off-topic, tackling subjects ranging from tax cuts to school classroom sizes. Romney uttered cliches about his opponent apologizing for America, while Obama pretended that his successful raid against Osama bin Laden was representative of his track record against al-Qaida more generally. The most interesting aspect of the debate was Romney trying to distance himself from George W Bush, explicitly saying the country didn&apos;t need another Iraq or Afghanistan war. The second most interesting was the level of mockery and sarcasm employed by Obama \u2013 he once reminded Romney that the military budget wasn&apos;t a game of battleship \u2013 which was unusual for an incumbent president. Perhaps Obama&apos;s most effective line, though, was when he said Romney would &quot;do the same things we did, but you&apos;d say them louder and somehow that will make a difference.&quot; It stung because it seemed true. Romney tried to be agreeable and avoid looking like a warmonger. Obama was aggressive and looked somewhat like he thought he was running from behind. Obama edged out Romney in the second and third debates, but Romney scored a decisive victory in the first. In the end, it appears that Romney has been the net beneficiary, turning this into a competitive race once again. Gallup has the former Massachusetts governor ahead, most swing state polls still suggest the president is the frontrunner.  But there&apos;s no debating, it&apos;s close. James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator Alex Slater: &apos;If anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama&apos;      America was deprived of a &quot;rock &apos;em, sock &apos;em&quot; third presidential debate this election season. Instead, what undecided voters in swing states got last night was a meandering, sometimes slightly argumentative, but largely somniferous discussion between two candidates more interested in mild personal attacks than in substantive foreign policy. Yes, Obama won the debate: 48% of a scientifically conducted poll with CNN voters confirmed the president&apos;s victory, but only by a relatively small margin. Indeed, 40% believed Governor Romney to be the victor. In an ever-tightening race, this should give Democrats pause. Romney&apos;s performance was nuanced to a fault. Clearly, his staff had tattooed the words &quot;do no harm&quot; on his arm before he stepped on stage. And clearly, the governor paid attention. Conscious of the tightening polls among female voters, Romney had obviously been briefed to be non-aggressive, to avoid the mantle of warmonger \u2013 in short, to avoid becoming the third rail of American politics: the bumbling, warmongering President George W Bush. But that also exposed him to appear weak, a &quot;yes man&quot; to Obama&apos;s four-year record in office. Indeed, as Mara Liasson, journalist for NPR, pointed out only minutes after the debate, Romney&apos;s most uttered words seemed to be &quot;I agree&quot;. The president, on the other hand, apart from inexplicably having been told to stare at the governor in what can only be described as a creepy glare, was in a feistier mood. For months now, his campaign has steadily avoided the &quot;go-to&quot; political tactic in the American political narrative: painting your opponent as a flip-flopper, undecided and vacillating on issues. That restraint was gone last night, as the president repeatedly delivered attack after attack on Romney&apos;s inconsistent record, from troops in Iraq to the surge in Afghanistan. In fact, if anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama repeating almost word for word parts of President Bush&apos;s second convention speech:  &quot;I will never shy away from defending America.&quot;  So, where does this leave the campaign in these closing weeks? Yes, Obama won tonight, but these debates have been lackluster at best. On the whole, the three match-ups can likely be called an overall draw, with the first debate propelling what the press is now calling &quot;Mittmentum&quot;. Nevertheless, the political calculus remains firmly in the president&apos;s favor, with Ohio \u2013 this election&apos;s pivotal state \u2013 looking likely to swing Obama&apos;s way. If that happens, political scientists across the country will be forced to return to the age-old \u2013 and still unresolved \u2013 question, &quot;Do debates really matter?&quot; And last night, here in Boca, that seemed doubtful at best. Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy Clyde Strategies Mark Weisbrot: &apos;It was a victory just to have drones mentioned&apos;     Mark Weisbrot    The presidential debate on foreign policy is always a painful and disgusting spectacle for any reality-based viewer. Both candidates play into the fantasy that the United States needs to spend more on its military than most of the world combined, because we face grave threats when the rest of the world knows that US foreign and military policy is all about power and empire. But this debate was somewhat less painful than those past because the candidates were forced to recognize that Americans are tired of war and that it was time to &quot;do some nation building here at home,&quot; as President Obama said more than once. Even Romney had to say, &quot;we don&apos;t want another Iraq, we don&apos;t want another Afghanistan.&quot; And both candidates were eager to turn the conversation to domestic policy, which is, of course, what more than 90% of the electorate will base their vote on. Although Obama tried to blur most distinctions between himself and Romney, there are some significant differences. Most importantly, Romney is more likely to go to war with Iran; this despite the fact that Obama shifted his position (during the debate) to Romney&apos;s position that Iran will have to give up its &quot;nuclear program&quot; (Obama started out saying &quot;nuclear weapons&quot; would not be tolerated). Romney&apos;s assertion that he wants to make &quot;pariahs&quot; of Iranian diplomats reflects a substantive difference \u2013 that he is less likely to seek a negotiated solution and more likely to start another disastrous war. Romney was also forced to acknowledge that he would pay for an additional $2tn in military spending with cuts to domestic spending, something most Americans don&apos;t want. Anti-war organizations petitioned moderator Bob Schieffer to ask a question about drones, and he did. Drones have killed hundreds of civilians in Pakistan, building a groundswell of hatred against America. The existence of the program is officially classified, and the Obama administration does not publicly acknowledge it, so it was something of a victory just to have it mentioned. On the technical side, Obama was combative and did very well, as he did in the second debate. If he loses this election \u2013 which is not likely, but still possible \u2013 it will be due to his failure to confront Romney on an issue that is most important to senior citizens, the only age group where he is losing. That issue is social security. Both Romney and his party are on the record in favor of cuts to social security, but Obama from the first debate has pretended that there is no difference on this issue. This is an enormous tactical and political blunder. Mark Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and president of Just Foreign Policy Malou Innocent: &apos;At last, Romney has adopted a tone of moderation&apos;      At last night&apos;s final presidential debate, Governor Mitt Romney diverged sharply from his empty rhetoric of muscular American leadership. How refreshing. On the campaign trail, Romney has evoked the bluster and relentless chest-thumping of President Bush. But last night, Romney conveyed an attitude of humility that many war-weary Americans are desperate to hear. In his early opening salvo, he congratulated President Obama for &quot;taking out Osama bin Laden,&quot; and added:   &quot;But we can&apos;t kill our way out of this mess.&quot;  Indeed, while going after al-Qaida is the right policy, meeting that challenge only militarily won&apos;t resolve the underlying political circumstances that give rise to terrorism. In another extraordinary turn, Romney said on the subject of getting the Muslim world to reject extremism that &quot;[w]e don&apos;t want another Iraq, we don&apos;t want another Afghanistan&quot;. Perhaps Romney&apos;s realist handlers \u2013 those who want him to win the presidency \u2013 have finally gotten to him: polls show overwhelmingly that Americans think the Iraq war was a mistake, and America paid an enormous price in blood and treasure for an Iraq under considerable Iranian influence. Even many in the GOP have turned against America&apos;s endless wars of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan. The governor was vague and evasive at times, perhaps to obscure the fact that his substantive differences with Obama were minimal and mainly semantic. For instance, on Syria, Romney&apos;s policy is no different than the incumbent&apos;s. He advocates helping the opposition by working with America&apos;s partners; finding responsible parties and rebels and arming them; working for the creation of a responsible government to replace Bashir al-Assad; and not getting drawn into a military conflict by injecting neither American troops nor a no-fly zone. On military spending, Romney came across as disjointed and contradictory. After all, if a President Romney intends to spend 4% of America&apos;s GDP on the military \u2013 an increase of $2tn over the next ten years \u2013 then how will his administration pay for that and close the budget deficit? Part of the problem is that Romney&apos;s vision appears to be driven by capabilities and tactics (incremental policies to achieve short-term objectives) rather than a clearly articulated strategy (a broad sense of guidance for our actions and decisions). Worse, both Romney and Obama embrace some of the same hawkish and meddlesome national security and surveillance policies adopted under President Bush. In that respect, President Obama&apos;s predecessor \u2013 and the pro-interventionist foreign policy establishment in Washington \u2013 was the debate&apos;s clear winner. For all of these flaws, though, Governor Romney&apos;s shift was still remarkable. Juxtaposed with his previous invocations of the American people watching the world and &quot;shaping events&quot;, or having &quot;confidence in our cause&quot; and &quot;resolve in our might&quot;, he appears to have realized Americans are tired after enduring the human and financial costs of two prolonged and deeply unpopular wars. At last, the Romney campaign has adopted a tone of moderation in the final weeks before the election. Malou Innocent is a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute Jim Geraghty: &apos;Some will find the president&apos;s diatribe unattractively sarcastic&apos;      In a perfect world, candidates would come to a foreign policy debate with great knowledge, recognition of the complications and difficulties in making the world a better place, and a humility about their ability to foresee events in a rapidly-changing world. Both candidates would recall that President George W Bush campaigned on a pledge for a humble foreign policy in 2000, and President Obama would recognize that promises such as closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay turned out to be much harder to keep than he expected.  Around the globe, promises are easier to make than keep. Every presidential challenger paints the incumbent as soft on China; once in office, the economic intertwining of the US and China, and Washington&apos;s quite limited ability to influence the decision-making in Beijing, become clearer. For four straight cycles, Bill Clinton and George W Bush pledged to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; for 16 years, those promises were perpetually delayed. (Of course, this year the issue briefly returned again, as Democrats had a floor fight over a declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.) Unfortunately, last night&apos;s debate occurred in a far from perfect world. Voters aren&apos;t thinking about foreign policy right now, and both candidates knew it. There aren&apos;t that many undecided voters left, and those that are may not have been watching. The debate was up against Monday Night Football and the seventh game of the baseball playoffs, suggesting viewership would be lower than the preceding two presidential debates. To the extent undecided voters think about foreign policy at all, they&apos;re quasi-isolationist and poorly informed. The last thing they want to hear is that the world is complicated, or that the US can&apos;t tell other countries to go pound sand. Finally, while Bob Schieffer seemed to hit the right balance of tough questions without frequent interruptions, the topics were heavily focused on the Middle East. In 90 minutes of debate, there was no discussion of the European Union, its currency and debt crises, and what that could mean for the US economy. No mention of violence on our southern border with Mexico; no mention of India. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went into Monday night with dramatically different strategies. The president seemed to think he needed a knockout blow and his base undoubtedly believes he landed one after another, while some will find the president&apos;s &quot;horses and bayonets&quot; and Battleship diatribe remarkably condescending and unattractively sarcastic (the Democratic base undoubtedly believes Mitt Romney is a joke and deserves to be treated as such). The independents and folks who climbed onto the Romney bandwagon since the first debate are unlikely to be persuaded by this sneer, however. Romney, on the other hand, aimed to look presidential. The result was a remarkably uncombative debate performance. It seems he believed Obama&apos;s last big card to play was that Romney would be a duplicate of George W Bush on issues of war and peace, and so he disarmed it by declaring early on, &quot;we can&apos;t kill our way out of this mess.&quot; The word &quot;peace&quot; was used 12 times last night; it was spoken by Romney every time. It was a sales pitch to a war-weary nation \u2013 likely to be effective, even if the next four years are rather unlikely to see any genuine, lasting peace.

Please do not post details of further episodes if you have seen them). Previously, on Homeland: US marine Nick Brody was freed from captivity in Afghanistan. Later we learn that he witnessed the carnage resulting from a secret US drone strike in Iraq, where he was being held by Abu Nazir, a charismatic terrorist leader with Saudi links who bears some resemblance to Osama bin Laden. In the new series, the action has shifted to Lebanon, where recovering bipolar CIA agent Carrie has contacted a trusted source with extraordinary intelligence. Riveted? Impressed? Or maybe just confused? Homeland&apos;s researchers have certainly done their homework on the dark side of Middle Eastern politics. The programme is replete with references that could have been culled from news headlines at any time in recent months \u2013 or that you might well read in the near future. Israel bombs Iranian nuclear facilities but can&apos;t quite finish the job, we learn from a disappointed US vice-president. That&apos;s maybe more Dick Cheney than Joe Biden, but the point is clear and convincing enough. Extraordinary topicality was in evidence in last Sunday&apos;s episode where we saw Carrie&apos;s former boss Saul Berenson stopped at Beirut airport and his bag searched in breach of diplomatic protocol \u2013 by a Lebanese security man (who observes menacingly that the American has a Jewish-sounding name). Saul accuses him of working for Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia movement-cum-militia with close links to Iran, which has been accused of targeting Lebanese opponents and supporting Bashar al-Assad \u2013 as well as fighting Israel. So far, so plausible. OK, there is the odd far-fetched twist in the plot and some extraordinary security breaches. But there are also a few clunking errors, not least because the Lebanese scenes were filmed in Israel \u2013 a safer and more congenial environment in which to show a CIA sniper team targeting terrorists in an Arab capital. Unbelievably, a scene showing Carrie being pursued down a Beirut alleyway featured ads and posters in Hebrew. Other glimpses of Israel include cars with blurred yellow Israeli license plates, a famous clock tower in Jaffa and a rooftop scene showing the Tel Aviv skyline. Maybe these are technical glitches that only cognoscenti would spot. But this is a touchy area. It annoyed the Lebanese government enough to ponder legal action over the portrayal of Hamra street in west Beirut as the kind of place where Abu Nazir would meet a Hizbullah bigwig. Hamra is full of cafes, bookshops and bars, and far from the Shia southern suburbs where Hizbullahis hang out. It wasn&apos;t a great ad for the Lebanese tourist board. Then again, last week, a car bomb was set off in the nearby area of Ashrafieh, killing eight people, including the Lebanese intelligence chief Wissam al-Hassan, and injuring 78 more. And then there&apos;s a more substantial puzzler: why would an al-Qaida (Sunni) jihadi type be cooperating with (Shia, Iranian-backed) Hizbullah anyway? Occasional rumours and propaganda apart, there&apos;s never been any hint that Tehran has backed al-Qaida, though it did shelter some Bin Laden relatives for a while. It&apos;s no secret that Homeland was inspired by a popular Israeli TV series called Hatufim (The Abducted, or Prisoners of War as it was translated for broadcast), which tells the story of soldiers readjusting to ordinary life after prolonged captivity. The best known true-life example was Gilad Shalit, the young corporal captured on the Israeli side of the border with the Gaza Strip and held for five years until he was swapped for 1,027 Palestnian prisoners. No real-life Israeli has developed sympathy for his captors the way the fictional US marine did. Homeland purports to portray a nuanced version of the &quot;war on terror&quot; but the story is still told through a national security prism and (as Peter Beaumont pointed out recently in the Observer) with more than a touch of Islamophobia \u2014 from Brody&apos;s badly pronounced &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; while praying secretly in his garage, to the portrayal of all the Muslim characters as devious and cruel. Strikingly, the cast has not (yet) included any Palestinians \u2013 important players in the contemporary Middle East. Like it or not their grievances are highly relevant to Arab/Muslim hostility to Israel and its US protectors. You don&apos;t have to be Abu Nazir to observe that neither are simply the passive victims of evil and motiveless terrorists. But why spoil a rattling good story with too many confusing details from the messier and even longer-running series that is the real world?", "publicationDate": "2012-10-25T12:11:10Z", "title": "Homeland: does it give an accurate picture of Middle East politics?", "sentences": ["Other glimpses of Israel include cars with blurred yellow Israeli license plates, a famous clock tower in Jaffa and a rooftop scene showing the Tel Aviv skyline."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/25/homeland-accurate-picture-middle-east-politics"}, {"tags": ["Turkey", "Iran", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan", "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"], "article": "All but unnoticed by the wider world, Turkey&apos;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held an unscheduled t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate last week with the US&apos;s most despised bogeyman, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Given deep disagreements over Syria, and Iranian anger at Turkey&apos;s decision to allow the US to deploy missile defence systems on its soil, the meeting at a regional economic summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, was something of a surprise. Neither man gave much away after the encounter, but officials said ways of defusing the Syrian crisis were discussed. After a year or more of backing opposing sides, and with a military solution apparently beyond the reach of both Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime and Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, Iran and Turkey have a shared interest in calming things down. The Syrian regime&apos;s reported agreement, strongly backed by Iran and Turkey, to begin a limited truce this weekend may be one result of this new approach. It also reflects a changing Turkish stance that puts new emphasis on forging a regional solution to the Syrian impasse in the absence of effective US, UN or other international action. Turkey has been badly burned by the Syrian conflagration and feels let down by Washington and its European Nato allies, who have rebuffed its calls for border buffer areas, no-fly zones and armed humanitarian intervention. It has all but given up hope that either a re-elected Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will show a stronger lead. An estimated 150,000 Syrian refugees have flooded over Turkey&apos;s southern frontier. Trade with Syria, once worth an annual $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn), has dwindled to a trickle. Resulting economic hardship and political instability in Hatay and other Turkish border provinces, home to large numbers of Arab Alevis who identify with Syria&apos;s ruling Alawite minority, has rung alarm bells in Ankara. &quot;Turkish policy on Syria was thrown into total confusion by Assad&apos;s refusal to stand down last year,&quot; said Cengiz Aktar, a leading Turkish commentator. &quot;They were expecting him to go the way of Mubarak [in Egypt] and Gaddafi [in Libya], or better still Ben Ali [the Tunisian president who fled into exile]. But nothing of the kind happened \u2026 The US and Europe were not prepared to back any military operations and the Russians were doing their own thing \u2026 Turkey ran out of options.&quot; To make matters worse, Turkish officials are convinced the Syrian regime, retaliating for Turkish support for the FSA, is aiding and abetting Kurdistan Workers&apos; party (PKK) separatist fighters, whose terror attacks on targets in south-east Turkey are at a 10-year high. The PKK&apos;s Syrian offshoot, the Party of Unity and Democracy (PYD), which claims to represent Syria&apos;s Kurdish minority, has also profited from the chaos. Turkey worries the PYD may try to set up an autonomous region in northern Syria, akin to Massoud Barzani&apos;s Kurdistan regional government (KRG) in northern Iraq. &quot;Particularly alarming was the capture of several towns along the Turkish border by the PYD,&quot; said Gonul Tol, of the Centre for Turkish Studies at the Middle East Institute. &quot;Turkey watched nervously as Kurdish groups took control of the towns after the withdrawal of Assad forces and hoisted the Kurdish flag over Syrian government buildings, along with posters of the PKK&apos;s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan,&quot; Tol wrote. Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey&apos;s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an interview conducted last week: &quot;When the regime has withdrawn from certain places in Syria, sometimes they are giving weapons or other means to let the PKK control those parts of Syria \u2026 The PKK is trying to use the chaotic situation in the region for their own activities.&quot; A recent spate of incidents along the 560-mile border has reinforced the impression the situation is spinning out of control. Turkish and Syrian military units exchanged fire repeatedly after a Syrian shell killed five Turkish civilians in a border town earlier this month. And a huge diplomatic row broke out last week after Turkish fighter jets forced down a Syrian passenger plane en route from Russia to Damascus. Turkey claimed the plane was carrying military equipment, an allegation furiously denied in Moscow. Security issues aside, Syria has become a massive political headache. Erdogan and Davutoglu have been heavily criticised for first engaging with Assad last year, in the belief they could talk him round, and then going to the other extreme this year, noisily demanding his resignation when they lacked the means to enforce it. &quot;They were naive. They bet that Assad would fall. And they were wrong,&quot; said a former national newspaper editor. &quot;Erdogan is frustrated. He feels Assad sold him out. He takes everything personally.&quot; Capitalising on opinion polls that show a large majority of Turks fears a war with Syria and opposes any kind of intervention, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People&apos;s party (CHP), rounded on Davutoglu, saying his famous policy of &quot;zero problems with neighbours&quot;, adopted in 2002 as Ankara sought to re-establish itself as a regional superpower, was a flop. Kilicdaroglu said Turkey was isolated over Syria, with only Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the KRG in Iraq and Hamas on its side. Against it were ranged Russia, China, Iran, Brazil and India. &quot;How can we describe the policy that put Turkey into this situation?&quot; Kilicdaroglu asked. &quot;Is this &apos;strategic depth&apos; [a favourite Davutoglu concept] or strategic blindness? The process that resulted in Turkey becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world \u2026 You have to be a real idiot to do that.&quot; Clear signs are now emerging that the government is changing tack, and that by mending fences with neighbours such as Iran, Russia, and maybe even Nouri al-Maliki&apos;s Iraq, it hopes to forge a binding Syrian solution that is guaranteed by the regional powers and bridges what at present is a growing Sunni-Shia sectarian divide. Part of this new approach, outlined by Erdogan, is to establish a set of parallel talks mechanisms bringing together Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which want Assad to resign, and Russia and Iran, who have resisted forced regime change. Welcoming the move, the H\u00fcrriyet columnist Semih Idiz said Turkish policy on Syria had become a &quot;rudderless ship&quot; and a course correction was long overdue. &quot;This represents a significant shift in position by Ankara\u00a0\u2026 It was no more than a few months ago that Ankara looked coolly on any discussion on Syria which involved Russia and Iran,&quot; Idiz said. Intriguingly, this revamped region-based approach may include a rapprochement with Israel. Ties ruptured in 2010 amid a bitter row over the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza aid flotilla that was stormed by Israeli commandos. Alarmed at events across its disputed Golan Heights border, Israel has put out diplomatic feelers, suggesting that at this time of crisis, Tel Aviv and Ankara should set aside old differences and work together. Pinhas Avivi, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and former ambassador to Turkey, offered bilateral talks on Syria this week. Turkey&apos;s public response has been cool so far, but political insiders say Ankara has a strong interest in making up. Speaking to the Guardian, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey&apos;s foreign minister, said Turkey had always believed in a regional approach and was optimistic Russia, for example, with which he was maintaining regular high-level contacts, could be part of a solution. While flatly rejecting suggestions his Syria policy had failed, he was adamant Assad would have to step down if a lasting settlement were to be secured. He said: &quot;Every day I am asking myself, what more could be done to prevent this bloodshed. We have done everything\u00a0\u2026 We have tried bilateral engagement with the regime to persuade them [to have] a transition process and help them go to a democratic system \u2026 &quot;For several months we tried, even before the Arab spring \u2026 We went to Damascus last August [2011] \u2026 He [Assad] accepted our step-by-step plan but after two, three days he did not fulfil his promise\u00a0\u2026 We realised he was cheating us and trying to misuse his relationship with us. &quot;Still we have regional engagement with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia\u00a0\u2026 What else can we do? I think it would not be ethical at all to continue business as usual\u00a0\u2026 Ethically and strategically our policy has been right. Ethically it is right because we are on the side of human rights, we are on the side of the rightful aspirations of Syrian people. Strategically it is right because we are on the right side of history. &quot;At the end of the day, this regime cannot continue the way it is, and the new elected government of Syria will be the best friend of Turkey.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-10-25T17:02:28Z", "title": "Iran and Turkey's meeting reveals new approach to Syria", "sentences": ["Alarmed at events across its disputed Golan Heights border, Israel has put out diplomatic feelers, suggesting that at this time of crisis, Tel Aviv and Ankara should set aside old differences and work together."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/iran-turkey-new-approach-syria"}, {"tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Breakfast", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Nutrition", "Diets and dieting"], "article": "Up to two-thirds of us skip the first meal of the day but nutritionists say we should breakfast like kings and eat less later. There is some research that links eating a good breakfast with a reduction in the risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. While it&apos;s tempting to miss breakfast when you&apos;re on a diet, it&apos;s not clear that this helps you to lose weight. Last week a research team from Imperial College London presented its findings at the Neuroscience 2012 conference. The researchers scanned the brains of 21 healthy people as they showed them a variety of foods including chocolate, pizza and salad. They compared how attractive the foods were to people, as well as how much they ate for lunch after the scan on two days, one on which breakfast was missed and one on which they ate a large breakfast (750 calories). The researchers found that missing breakfast increased the appeal of high-calorie foods (as measured by increased orbital frontal cortex activity on the brain scan) and that people ate about 250 calories more at lunch. The researchers said this shows breakfast takes the edge off our appetite so we don&apos;t crave high-calorie foods. So, how should we be starting our days? The solution Studies have come up with a variety of suitable breakfast foods. There is some evidence in favour of the full English version (on the basis that eating fats primes the metabolism to be more efficient for the rest of the day). However, that study was done on mice and is not convincing \u2013 although the mice who ate a good breakfast were less likely to get chubby. Chocolate cake is recommended by researchers from Tel Aviv University who found that a 600-calorie breakfast with proteins and carbohydrates, including a sweet treat, controlled cravings for sweet things for the rest of the day and kickstarted the body&apos;s metabolism. Their study looked at 193 obese people over 32 weeks and found those who ate sweet things at breakfast lost an average of 40lb more than those who didn&apos;t. A study in the US journal Pediatrics of more than 2,000 teenagers found that a quarter missed breakfast but that those who ate it were on average five pounds\u00a0lighter (and ironically less likely to have been dieting) than those who didn&apos;t. However, it is always hard to prove cause and effect in dieting studies. People who eat breakfast often turn out to take more exercise\u00a0and drink less alcohol so there may be other reasons for their weight loss. A review of the research that added up results of nine studies on the relationship between eating breakfast cereals and weight, found that children and adults who regularly ate breakfast cereals (the study was funded by Kellogg&apos;s) were less likely to be overweight than those who did not eat them. The authors say this doesn&apos;t provide proof that cereals help you stay slim and that there was no evidence that their cereal eaters ate less throughout the day. So, although eating breakfast is linked with being slimmer, this may simply be an association. There is, however, another more robust body of evidence that suggests children benefit from eating breakfast because it helps them to concentrate.", "publicationDate": "2012-10-28T21:00:44Z", "title": "Should I eat breakfast?", "sentences": ["Chocolate cake is recommended by researchers from Tel Aviv University who found that a 600-calorie breakfast with proteins and carbohydrates, including a sweet treat, controlled cravings for sweet things for the rest of the day and kickstarted the body&apos;s metabolism."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/28/should-i-eat-breakfast"}, {"tags": ["Jacob Zuma", "World Cup 2014", "Hapoel Tel Aviv", "Beitar Jerusalem", "Race issues", "Fifa", "Football politics", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": "Football family news: president of the week Jacob Zuma: defending the publicly-funded refit of his country estate, two years after launching his vision of a World Cup economic legacy for &quot;all South Africans&quot;.

Outside, the road which used to carry heavy traffic from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is now known as the street of ghosts. At its abrupt end, rubbish blows up against the 8-metre-high concrete wall that has killed the village of Bir Nabala. Musa Sabah, 51, who along with his brothers sank $1m of savings into the land on which his flourishing wedding hall business was built, now works as a part-time driving instructor and lives in a rented house which is too small for him, his wife and four of their children who still live at home. His 18-year-old daughter wants to go to university, but Sabah can&apos;t afford the fees and he hopes she will commit to an early marriage instead. The vast West Bank separation barrier, which Israel began constructing 10 years ago, reached Bir Nabala in 2006, a year after Sabah opened a second wedding hall, upstairs in the same building. Business was good: the two halls hosted an average of seven weddings a week over that year, with most bookings coming from families in nearby East Jerusalem. &quot;Suddenly there was no access to the hall,&quot; said Sabah. &quot;We had to give back all the deposits people paid.&quot; Ten workers were laid off, the building was padlocked, Sabah was ruined. And it wasn&apos;t just Sabah. Almost all the businesses in the thriving village between Jerusalem and Ramallah closed. Palestinians from East Jerusalem who had bought or rented houses and apartments fled back to the city rather than endure a long roundabout journey, via the massive Qalandiya checkpoint, to jobs which previously had been 10 minutes drive away. Abandoned, shuttered and looted apartment blocks and businesses are now the defining feature of Bir Nabala. The area was completely encircled by the wall, leaving one road open. Bir Nabala, said Sabah, used to be &quot;a central place, right in the middle&quot;, a commercial hub between Jerusalem and Ramallah. Now it is a desolate wasteland. According to a new report, The Long Term Impact of the Separation Barrier, by the Israeli human rights group B&apos;Tselem, the isolation of Bir Nabala &quot;has caused a mass exodus from the village, abandonment of residential neighbourhoods and economic stasis&quot;. In general, says the report, the barrier has led to &quot;numerous infringements of the human rights of Palestinians, over and above the direct damage done by its construction \u2013 including property rights, the right to free movement, the right to a reasonable standard of living and collective right to self-determination.&quot; B&apos;Tselem calls on the Israeli government to dismantle all sections of the barrier already built inside the West Bank and halt further construction. The report also details the impact of the barrier on Palestinians caught in the &quot;seam zone&quot;, the area between the internationally-recognised Green Line and the route of the wall or fence. When the barrier is completed, 9.4% of Palestinian territory will be on the Israeli side. A complex system of permits is required for Palestinians who need to cross the barrier, in either direction, to reach land, jobs, businesses, educational or health facilities. Israel says the route of the barrier is determined by security needs, and that its construction is the reason for the decline in attacks by Palestinian militants inside Israel. Sabah smiles bitterly at this explanation. &quot;Israel built the wall for political reasons, to take the land, not security,&quot; he says. Without the wall, he reckons the value of his land and building would have doubled by now. &quot;Now no one will buy it. There is no future for this village unless the wall is removed.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-05T07:00:03Z", "title": "How the West Bank barrier has starved business and community", "sentences": ["Outside, the road which used to carry heavy traffic from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is now known as the street of ghosts."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/west-bank-barrier-starved-business-communities"}, {"tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Microsoft Surface RT more profitable than iPad, teardown analysis reveals &gt;&gt; IHS iSuppli&apos;s Teardown portal provides deeper insights into bill of materials, BOM cost, photo analysis and graphical representation of electronics.

We all remember fondly the great teacher we had at school, who had the kindness to give us that little extra self-confidence. What about now? Who do you look up to? In the run-up to Anti-Bullying Week, and as today is World Kindness Day I asked three educators whom I look up to about how to teach empathy and to share their top tips. Mary Gordon developed an award-winning programme for primary school children in which the teacher is depicted as a baby, Canada  Teaching empathy is experiential. There is no flash card for empathy, it does not develop like that. You have to see it, to experience it, so we need to teach with empathy. My main advice to teachers is very simple: &quot;Let&apos;s be people, human beings, before we are teachers.&quot; And that starts with taking care of ourselves. Teachers are incredibly hard on themselves, in the same way that parents are hard on themselves. People don&apos;t appreciate how emotionally exhausting teaching is. So my first advice is really love yourself. Also, we might find that when we teach with empathy, we are less exhausted, because as we are connecting with students, they will behave differently, and it will reduce stress in the classroom. We&apos;re so guarded as teachers not to seem weak or out of the control. Sometimes we just need to allow ourselves to say: &quot;The way I&apos;m teaching is not getting through, let me try another way. How about this? Is this working? Thank you for helping me to find a good way to teach.&quot; As a primary school teacher I used to review the day with the class and be honest: &quot;We&apos;ve had a little difficulty today with such and such. How can we do this differently tomorrow?&quot; When you do this, you&apos;re showing your humanity. Instead of being so driven by school results, we should really be measuring what we treasure. More than the marks in English, it&apos;s the happiness in the class room that counts. If you can show a child how to fail well, and pick themselves up and carry on, that the greatest favour you can do to them. Katherine Weare is a professor of education at Southampton University, England Teaching is a tough job and policy makers need to balance their rightful concern with test scores, inspections and accountability with an empathetic and mindful concern for staff wellbeing. An effective school ethos puts warmth and mutually respectful communication and relationships with staff, pupils and parents at the heart, takes an inclusive approach which values all types of pupil, encourages pupils to think for themselves and move towards autonomy and self reliance, has high and positive expectations for all, and sets in place appropriate boundaries so that all feel safe. Achieving this balance is not easy, and effective implementation needs clear goals, positive leadership, solid staff development, expert support, and the involvement of pupils and parents so their voices can be heard. In this whole process, the development of mindfulness is proving to be a valuable tool and a key which unlocks many doors. Mindfulness refers to the ability to focus on what is happening in the present moment rather than ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, and with curiosity and kindness rather than critical and negative judgment. Most of us do not do this automatically, so learning it explicitly as a life skill through courses and lessons in which we learn some simple mindfulness practices can be invaluable. Learning to be more mindful has been shown to improve self-awareness, self-regard, empathy, wellbeing, and the ability to cope with stress and pressure with calmness and equanimity. Some schools are starting to teach mindfulness to their staff and pupils, and the research evidence is showing clear and demonstrable beneficial effects. We need particularly to be self-aware enough to catch the natural inclination to empathise most with pupils, and parents, most like ourselves and see the rest as irrational and/or bad, thus through punitive responses unwittingly contributing to the cycle of failure and alienation from school of the children we claim to want to help. It is interesting that bullies are often well liked by teachers as they often have high self-esteem and are outgoing. Unless we know this we can again unwittingly add to the problem. Rony Berger trains teachers to use a resiliency programme for children who are the victims of war, terrorism and natural disaster, Tel Aviv University Though many people consider cultivating empathy the key factor in reducing violence and curbing bullying behaviour, based on my experience and research, it is essential but not sufficient. With that in mind, I believe teaching empathy is an ongoing process that builds on the following: \u2022 Be yourself and know yourself. Being a genuine and authentic human being is a must for every teacher. Self-awareness is also a prerequisite for being becoming an empathetic teacher and a role model. \u2022 Express your feelings. Teach feeling vocabulary by reflecting them in a respectful but accurate manner. \u2022 Explain your feelings and concomitant behaviours, teach kids perspective-taking and explain why you experience them. \u2022 Practice what you preach. Show empathy and love towards your pupils as well as towards others. \u2022 Develop value orientation. Spell out the values underlying your behaviours and stress their importance. \u2022 Provide children with an opportunity to engage in empathic pro-social behaviour. Start with small manageable opportunities that they are likely to succeed in and that are ecologically relevant, such as helping teachers or peers during school, sports or music. \u2022 Celebrate pro-social behaviour. Recognition for pro-social behaviour is as important as academic or talent recognition. Find ways to value it. Vinciane Rycroft is an educator specialising in sustainable development.

The assassination of Ahmed al-Jabari in a missile strike in Gaza City was the &quot;start of a broader operation&quot;, according to the Israel Defence Forces, which it named Operation Pillar of Defence. Ground forces were on standby, the IDF said. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned that the military was &quot;prepared to expand&quot; its Gaza operation. A cabinet communique said the IDF would &quot;continue vigorous action against the terrorist infrastructures operating from the Gaza Strip against the civilian population in Israel&quot;. It would, &quot;to the best of its ability, work to avoid harming civilians&quot;. In a statement on Twitter, the IDF said: &quot;All options are on the table. If necessary, the IDF is ready to initiate a ground operation in Gaza.&quot; The Israeli navy also confirmed that its gunships had fired shells into the Gaza Strip, and there were unconfirmed reports of an incursion in the south of the Gaza Strip late on Wednesday. As Hamas&apos;s armed wing warned that Jabari&apos;s assassination &quot;had opened the gates of hell&quot;, Israel was braced for a surge in rocket fire from Gaza aimed at communities in the south of the country. Residents in towns in southern Israel were ordered to stay in bomb shelters, and schools in a 40km radius closed. The United Nations security council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday night to discuss the onslaught and heard a plea from the Palestinian UN observer to stop &quot;war crimes being perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people&quot;. The Israeli ambassador replied that the strikes were launched after days of rocket fire out of Gaza and Israel had a right to defend itself. The council adjourned without issuing a collective statement and did not schedule any further action or talks on the issue. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, released statements saying he had spoken to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi about &quot;the worrisome escalation of violence in southern Israel and Gaza and the need to prevent any further deterioration&quot;. The conflict could fracture Israel&apos;s shaky relations with the post-revolution government in Egypt, which has strong ties with Hamas. Since Egypt&apos;s former president and ally Hosni Mubarak was ousted February last year, Israel has feared for the durability of the peace treaty between the two countries. Following the launch of the operation, Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel, and Israel&apos;s envoy to Cairo was also preparing to leave the country. The Obama administration backed the Israeli airstrikes. Barack Obama spoke directly with Netanyahu and the Israeli prime minister thanked the president for his support, the two administrations said. Netanyahu also spoke with the vice-president, Joe Biden. Obama made a separate call to President Mohammed Morsi of Egypt, the White House said. The two men agreed on the need to calm down the conflict as quickly as possible. US state department spokesman Mark Toner denounced Hamas militants and others in Gaza for a barrage of rocket fired into southern Israel. He said the US supported Israel&apos;s right to self-defence. &quot;We support Israel&apos;s right to defend itself and we encourage Israel to continue to take every effort to avoid civilian casualties,&quot; Toner said. Solidarity attacks from Islamic jihadist groups, which Israel says are operating in Egypt&apos;s Sinai peninsula to the south, and from Hezbollah in Lebanon, which Israel believes has thousands of rockets ready to fire over the northern border, can not be ruled out. Dan Harel, a former deputy army chief of staff, said: &quot;It might draw them in. There was a volley of fire this morning from the south. We don&apos;t know yet if it came from the Sinai ... Hopefully Hezbollah will keep themselves out of the engagement.&quot; Hamas and other militant organisations could deploy longer-range missiles in its arsenals, some of which can reach densely populated cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The IDF claimed multiple air strikes had hit more than 20 underground rocket launchers belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It said it was targeting long-range rockets, such as the Fajr-5, which has a range of up to 75km. Jabari, head of Hamas&apos;s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, died when his car was struck in Gaza City by a missile following almost a week of rocket fire from Gaza. Palestinian reports said 10 people died in airstrikes, including two children. Sami Abu Salem, a local journalist, said civilian cars were bringing the wounded to the Shifa hospital in Gaza City. &quot;I saw women and children bleeding from their heads and necks, and a baby who was burned.&quot; Gazans were stocking up on emergency supplies of canned food in preparation for war, he added. Jabari is the most senior Hamas operative to be killed by Israel for almost four years, since Operation Cast Lead, its three-week assault on the Gaza Strip during the winter of 2008-09 that left about 1,400 Palestinians dead. The IDF said Jabari was &quot;a senior Hamas operative who served in the upper echelon of the Hamas command and was directly responsible for executing terror attacks against the state of Israel&quot;. Its operation was intended &quot;to severely impair the command and control chain of the Hamas leadership, as well as its terrorist infrastructure. This was a surgical operation in co-operation with the Israeli security agency, that was implemented on the basis of concrete intelligence and using advanced capabilities&quot;. According to Reuters, calls for revenge were broadcast in Gaza after the air strikes. &quot;Israel has declared war on Gaza and they will bear the responsibility for the consequences,&quot; Islamic Jihad said. The Associated Press reported that &quot;plumes of black smoke wafted into Gaza City&apos;s skies following at least five airstrikes, in an atmosphere reminiscent of Israel&apos;s large-scale 2008-09 attack on Gaza ... Outside the hospital [where Jabari&apos;s body was taken], thousands of angry Gazans chanted &apos;retaliation&apos; and &apos;we want you to hit Tel Aviv tonight&apos;.&quot; Israel had warned for several days that it may launch an offensive in Gaza after more than 130 rockets were fired by militants in recent days. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he would choose &quot;the right time to exact the heaviest price ... Whoever thinks that they can damage the daily lives of residents of the south, and that they won&apos;t pay a heavy price for this ... they are mistaken&quot;. Most political figures in Israel endorsed the operation. The Labour leader, Shelly Yachimovich, said Israel was &quot;united in its war against terrorism&quot;. But Dov Hanin, of the leftwing Hadash party, condemned the killing . &quot;In place of the leaders killed, others will grow, and we will only get another cycle of fire and blood,&quot; he said. Egypt&apos;s foreign ministry has condemned the operation and urged Israel to halt targeted killings. The Freedom and Justice party, the Muslim Brotherhood&apos;s political arm, called the assassination a &quot;crime that requires a quick Arab and international response to stem these massacres against the besieged Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip&quot;. A spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry also criticised the killing. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called for &quot;an immediate de-escalation of tensions&quot;, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, was reported to have called for an urgent Arab league meeting.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T04:44:00Z", "title": "Hamas says 'gates of hell opened' as Israel kills military leader in Gaza", "sentences": ["We don&apos;t know yet if it came from the Sinai ...

In his harshest criticism of Israel since taking office in June, Morsi expressed his solidarity with the &quot;people of Gaza&quot; and the Palestinians. Speaking in Cairo, Morsi said he had withdrawn Egypt&apos;s ambassador to Israel and appealed to the UN to intervene to halt the spiralling violence. &quot;The Israelis must realise that this aggression is unacceptable and would only lead to instability in the region,&quot; Morsi declared. His remarks illustrate the new and potentially volatile dynamics of the situation in the region, with Egypt&apos;s post-revolutionary government expressing strong support for Hamas. The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel now looks increasingly fragile, following the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in February last year, and as the violent confrontation between Hamas and Israel worsens. Morsi said he had spoken to the US president, Barack Obama, by phone. The Egyptian president said he wanted to maintain good relations with the US while &quot;rejecting this aggression and the spilling of blood and the blockade of Palestinians&quot;. Israeli warplanes bombed targets on Thursday in and around Gaza City, where tall buildings trembled. Plumes of smoke and dust furled into a sky laced with the vapour trails of outgoing rockets, Reuters reported. The Palestinian death toll rose to 15, with the victims including a woman pregnant with twins, an 11-month-old boy and two infants. At least 130 people had been wounded, Gaza&apos;s health ministry said. Israel said it had struck 156 targets in Gaza, 126 of them rocket launchers. The Israeli military onslaught follows the assassination on Wednesday of Ahmed al-Jabari, the commander of Hamas&apos;s military wing. His corpse was borne through the streets wrapped in a bloodied white shroud. Thousands of mostly young men attended his funeral on Thursday, crowding around his grave. Mourners strained to stroke Jabari&apos;s face and clutch his hands. The funeral took place against a backdrop of gunfire, with tracers from Israel&apos;s Iron Dome missile-defence batteries visible, shooting down rockets fired from Gaza. Witnesses spoke of a mood of fear. Hamas supporters, many wearing trademark Hamas baseball caps, fired in the air at the funeral to celebrate news of the three Israeli deaths. There were chants for Jabari of: &quot;You have won.&quot; Senior Hamas figures stayed away, wary of Israel&apos;s warning that they are now considered targets. Militants in the Gaza Strip pounded southern Israel with rocket fire. Life on both sides of the border came to a standstill, the Associated Press reported, with Gaza&apos;s streets mostly empty as the strip came under Israeli attack. Residents in southern Israel remained huddled indoors or close to home, and were under orders to stay in bomb shelters. The three Israelis were killed when a rocket hit their four-storey building in the town of Kiryat Malachi, 15 miles north of Gaza. A four-year-old boy and two babies were also wounded. The victims were the first on the Israeli side since the violence started. Israel said 200 rockets had struck Israel since Wednesday, 135 since midnight. Israel&apos;s Iron Dome missile-defence batteries had shot down 18 of them, officials said. Hamas claimed it had fired a one-tonne rocket at Tel Aviv, but there was no sign of an impact in the city. &quot;The military will continue acting to establish deterrence against Hamas and to return the calm,&quot; the defence minister, Ehud Barak, said during a tour of southern Israel. He praised citizens for coping with the &quot;tough moments to come&quot;. Qatar, Jordan, Iran and Syria all condemned the Israeli operation on Thursday. It amounts to the most serious fighting between Israel and Hamas for four years.

He also urged Israel to reduce tensions and avoid civilian casualties.

These are now threatened by Gaza militants who vow to resume the suicide bombings that terrorised Israeli cities a decade or more ago. Hamas official Ismail al-Ashqar said the &quot;resistance&apos;s possibilities&quot; were now unlimited. Abu Ahmed of Islamic Jihad&apos;s military wing warned all means would be used to exact a terrible revenge for Jabari&apos;s death. &quot;There are no more red lines,&quot; he said. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s pugnacious prime minister, and his faithful sidekick, defence minister Ehud Barak, presumably took such inflamed reactions into account when they set Operation Pillar of Defence in train. Perhaps they discount them as empty rhetoric on a par with Hamas&apos;s &quot;opening the gates of hell&quot; soundbite, grimly regurgitated by the BBC and other media on Thursday. If they do, they risk repeating costly mistakes of the past. The history of Middle Eastern wars, and more particularly, Israel&apos;s most recent conflicts \u2013 Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2008 and Lebanon in 2006 \u2013 is pitted with miscalculations about the capabilities of the &quot;enemy&quot;, his ability to inflict real pain and the length of time needed to subdue him. Cast Lead, which left up to 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead, was a bloody own goal, dressed up as a victory, that entailed severe, lasting political and diplomatic consequences for Israel without achieving its primary military objective \u2013 the defanging of Hamas. Given that, after the initial shock, Palestinian resistance is likely to grow rather than subside, what is unclear now, as in 2008, is how far Israel&apos;s leaders are prepared to go in carrying the fight to Gaza, and where it may end. What constitutes success? Will it take a ground invasion, as some have hinted? The hail of rocket fire that followed Jabari&apos;s killing suggests an open-ended conflict may be unfolding. The deaths of three Israeli civilians on Thursday morning, killed by a missile that evaded Israel&apos;s much vaunted Iron Dome air defence, did not follow the Netanyahu-Barak script. Ostensibly learning from past errors, Barak defined the operation&apos;s aims this time around. Israel, he said, sought to strengthen deterrence, deplete the Hamas rocket infrastructure, damage Hamas and the other terror organisations, and minimise harm to the Israeli &quot;home front&quot;. But looked at closely, these are vague objectives, difficult to quantify or measure in any but the broadest terms. &quot;This is the beginning of an event and not the end,&quot; Barak admitted. &quot;The IDF will keep up the relentless air pressure with the unspoken threat of launching a ground operation if Hamas and the other terror groups strike at Tel Aviv or other strategic areas,&quot; commentator Mitch Ginsburg suggested. &quot;Beyond that, little is clear, for Hamas knows that Israel does not want to topple the regime entirely and usher in an era of chaos in the Gaza Strip, and Israel knows that it is very difficult to score points against a terror organisation reared on the ethos of suicide and dispersed among one of the most densely populated civilian areas in the world.&quot; Domestic political and international factors increase the potential for miscalculation and escalation. Netanyahu, who cultivates a strongman image, will seek-re-election in January. He is striving to impress Israeli voters with a decisive blow against Hamas, and cannot now desist until such a blow has been demonstrably delivered. Past constraints on Netanyahu&apos;s behaviour are absent this time. There is no discernible peace process, and no active US engagement (after Barack Obama&apos;s first-term efforts were ignominiously rebuffed). The west&apos;s favourite &quot;moderate Arabs&quot; are missing in action, or on the other side of the fence. Egypt&apos;s government has condemned Israeli actions; Jordan, destabilised by the Syria chaos, is in the throes of what could be the next Arab spring uprising. Meanwhile, the imminent bid by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, for non-member UN observer status for Palestine, staunchly opposed by Israel and the US, threatens further polarisation inside and outside Palestine. Ironically, Netanyahu&apos;s uncontrollable new Gaza war could also tip the scales in an internal power struggle within Hamas, strengthening the faction gathered around Gaza political chief Ismail Haniyeh at the expense of those Hamas leaders in exile who hope to succeed Khaled Meshaal. Netanyahu&apos;s war may actually end up bolstering Hamas in Gaza, or alternatively cause it to splinter and lose ground to more violently confrontationalist jihadi groups. Neither outcome would serve the all but forgotten cause of peaceful co-existence.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T15:00:00Z", "title": "Israel's latest Gaza attack could spiral out of control | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["&quot;The IDF will keep up the relentless air pressure with the unspoken threat of launching a ground operation if Hamas and the other terror groups strike at Tel Aviv or other strategic areas,&quot; commentator Mitch Ginsburg suggested."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/15/israel-gaza-attack-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Mohamed Morsi", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Hamas", "Israel", "Egypt", "Africa", "Muslim Brotherhood"], "article": "There will be no call to arms to support fallen brothers in Gaza. Instead, Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood government has adopted a more prosaic approach to the Israeli offensive on Gaza, centred on diplomatic avenues and multilateral efforts. Usually slow to react in a crisis, this time the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, responded quickly with a series of diplomatic gestures. He recalled Egypt&apos;s ambassador from Tel Aviv, had the foreign minister summon Israel&apos;s ambassador to Cairo to hand him a letter of protest, instructed Egypt&apos;s UN envoy to call for an emergency session of the UN security council and urged the Arab League to convene immediately. Morsi also delegated his prime minister, Hisham Qandil, to make a one-day visit to Gaza on Friday. Egypt also opened the Rafah border crossing to allow wounded Gazans to receive medical aid on the Egyptian side of the border. But whether all this is enough to assuage Egyptians \u2013 both secular and Islamist \u2013 incensed at yet another offensive on the besieged Gaza Strip, remains to be seen. &quot;It has to go down the diplomatic route, the international community cannot allow Israel to get away this,&quot; said Abdel-Mawgud Dardery, member of the foreign relations committee of the Brotherhood&apos;s political arm, the Freedom and Justice party. &quot;This is against human rights and the charters of the United Nations must change to allow Palestinians to resist occupation. We cannot put people in cages for years, that&apos;s inhumane.&quot; There are similarities with the Israeli assault on Gaza in December 2008. Back then, the regime of Hosni Mubarak faced a barrage of criticism for its perceived complicity in allowing Israel to strike Gaza. There was no love lost between Hamas and the then Egyptian president, who was happy to potentially see the back of the rulers of Gaza. Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood, and it was believed that the Egyptian reaction to an Israeli assault on them would be markedly different with the ascension of the Brotherhood to power in Egypt and the longstanding ties between the two groups. However, many who have been following the Brotherhood over the years believe otherwise. &quot;They are a reformist, not revolutionary, group. They have shown on many occasions that they are more than happy to keep the [1979] Camp David peace treaty with Israel and not radically alter Egyptian foreign policy. The excuses are ready, let&apos;s build Egypt first and so on,&quot; said Hossam Hamalawy, journalist and member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists movement. Morsi&apos;s measured response may not be enough to placate Egyptians, who have already begun protesting against the latest Israeli offensive, with more demonstrations scheduled for the next few days. The government response so far falls short of demands articulated by Hamalawy, which include the permanent opening of the Rafah crossing and not just for humanitarian reasons, but also to provide relief to the besieged territory, and the abolishment of the Camp David accords or, at the very least, a referendum on whether to keep the treaty. Waleed Shalaby, a spokesman for the Brotherhood&apos;s supreme guide, Mohamed Badie, said the Morsi administration had already taken bolder steps than any previous administration. &quot;The presidency has taken steps that have never been taken before. The political will is now in alignment with popular will in Egypt,&quot; he said, &quot;Political pressure on the Arab, Islamic and international levels is what&apos;s needed to save Palestinian lives.&quot; Non-Islamist voices are also wary of the repercussions of getting too drawn into events. Emad Gad, a foreign relations expert and former Egyptian MP, said: &quot;Egypt has to be careful not to be drawn into this conflict, so matters must be calibrated and calculated. But the Muslim Brotherhood rank and file may not be happy about this diplomatic approach.&quot; This seeming disconnect between Brotherhood members and its leadership, as well as secular opposition forces \u2013 whose commitment to the Palestinian cause is no less unerring than Islamist forces \u2013 could potentially prove troublesome for Morsi. &quot;The young base cadres of the Brotherhood are sincere about the Palestinian cause,&quot; Hamalawy said, &quot;what concerns me is the hypocritical and opportunistic leadership that mobilised mass protests when they were in opposition \u2013 with Morsi himself once calling for an end to Camp David \u2013 but now that they are in power they will not act upon it.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T16:23:28Z", "title": "Mohamed Morsi's approach to Gaza air strikes falls short for many Egyptians", "sentences": ["He recalled Egypt&apos;s ambassador from Tel Aviv, had the foreign minister summon Israel&apos;s ambassador to Cairo to hand him a letter of protest, instructed Egypt&apos;s UN envoy to call for an emergency session of the UN security council and urged the Arab League to convene immediately."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/mohamad-morsi-gaza-israel-egypt"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "Two funerals, two faces of Gaza. The first a display of strength and defiance, a jostling mass of thousands of conflict-hardened men, many brandishing weapons, pledging readiness to die for their cause over the bloodied corpse of Hamas military commander Ahmed al-Jaabari. The second consisted of a shattered family, incomprehension etched on their faces. A young father clutched the shrouded body of his 11-month-old son, a victim of the violence that is likely to cause more deaths in the days to come. The thread connecting these two scenes could be found in the vapour trails hanging in the clear skies above Gaza City, the black clouds of smoke rising from the ground and the thuds and booms punctuating the unsettling quiet of its usually bustling streets. According the Israeli military, more than 100 missiles were fired from Gaza on Thursday. It said its forces had struck more than 200 militant targets since Operation Pillar of Defence began on Wednesday, and its troops were moving south to get into position in case a ground invasion was ordered. By sunset, the death toll from this mini-war was at least 18, including three Israeli civilians and, according to Hamas health officials, four Palestinian children and a woman pregnant with twins. The operation drew condemnation from Egypt and Jordan and other nearby countries. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, warned of a catastrophe if there was another escalation in the region. Britain said it was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; and called on both sides to avoid any action which risked civilian casualties. The United States condemned Hamas for employing violence against the people of Israel. But in a backstreet of Gaza City, Jihad Misharawi&apos;s concerns were more immediate. As neighbours arrived to pay respects at his home, the 27-year-old BBC picture editor, still pale with shock, described how his family had been ripped apart in an instant. His wife Ahlam, sons Ali and Omar, brother Ahmed and sister-in-law Hiba were visiting a nearby house when they became worried about the possibility of an Israeli air strike. &quot;Ahlam wanted to leave, she felt it was not safe,&quot; he said. &quot;She took Ali and went outside the door. The others were following. But the bomb came, and everything was on fire.&quot; He showed visitors the blackened shell of the house: a hole blasted through its corrugated iron roof, scorched debris, burned and twisted furniture, an acrid smell of smoke. He pulled his mobile phone from his pocket to show horrific and haunting pictures of the blackened, rigid corpse of his baby boy, his mouth a charred rictus. &quot;What did my son do to die like this?&quot; the bereaved father asked against the sound of another boom nearby. &quot;We are not the resistance, there are no fighters in my house.&quot; A few miles away, Jaabari&apos;s resistance credentials were in no doubt as militants fired automatic weapons above the heads of the funeral throng and young men jostled and stretched to touch the face or grasp the hand of the man they described as a martyr. Shrouded in a blood-stained sheet and green Hamas flag, his body was carried on a simple wooden pallet through the streets from the al-Omari mosque to the huge Sheikh Radwan cemetery, final resting place of many militants during Gaza&apos;s long conflict with Israel. Outside the mosque, as men prayed on carpets laid on the pavement, 14-year-old Adnan Jaber said he was not frightened by the intense bombardment of the previous hours. &quot;It&apos;s normal in Gaza. The Israelis want to kill us, so we want to attack back.&quot; Jabil Abu Fanunah, 64-year-old gynaecologist, rejected such teenage bravado. &quot;My 26-year-old daughter came to sleep between me and her mother last night because she was so afraid. My children can&apos;t go to the bathroom or fetch water. The windows were shaking from the bombing all around the house. This is worse than the last war. We are under siege.&quot; He added: &quot;I am not Hamas. But we support what they do because they protect us.&quot; There was no support from Hassan Tamer Abu Daqen, speaking on his family&apos;s rooftop overlooking the cemetery. He had had enough of &quot;seeing dead people come here&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s not good for us, and it&apos;s not good for Israel,&quot; said the jobless 27-year-old. &quot;We can&apos;t keep killing each other. Peace is a better solution, and we need to learn to live with each other. Maybe peace will come if both Hamas and Israel want it.&quot; Did he think that was likely soon? &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; There was no sign of imminent peace as darkness heralded another night of fear for the people of Gaza and southern Israel. The Israeli military said a rocket fired from Gaza reached the city of Rishon LeZion, less than 10 miles from Tel Aviv. In Kiryat Malachi, a town close to the port city of Ashdod, the funerals were due to be held for three people killed when a Gaza rocket struck an apartment block on Thursday morning. Aharon Smajda, 49, Itzik Amsalem, 24, and Mirah Sharf, 27 \u2013 who was reportedly pregnant \u2013 were rushing to reach a fortified stairwell in the four-storey building, which did not have a secure bomb shelter. A four-year-old boy and two babies were also wounded. Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, pledged continued military action in Gaza and said citizens in the south were braced for tough moments to come.

Shaul Mofaz and Shelli Yacimovich, leaders of the Kadima and the Labour party respectively, currently in opposition, voiced their support for the operation. However, there were questions from leftwing and liberal figures about the timing and purpose of the attack, amid suggestions it was a politically motivated move to shore up Netanyahu&apos;s position before parliamentary elections in January. The veteran commentator Danny Rubinstein said the government would benefit in the short term. &quot;It is typical of these situations when things are going well at the beginning,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s good in the short term for Bibi, but things may not turn out so well.&quot; David Horovitz, editor of the online Times of Israel, described the use of force as &quot;widely regarded in Israel as both overdue and unavoidable&quot;. The obvious risk is that Hamas or other groups in Gaza may succeed in hitting a densely populated area in or around Tel Aviv in the centre of the country. Ha&apos;aretz, Israel&apos;s liberal daily newspaper, quoted Gershon Baskin, a peace activist involved in contacts with Hamas, as saying Jaabari had received the draft of a permanent truce agreement with Israel hours before he was killed on Wednesday. Baskin said senior officials in Israel knew about his contacts with Hamas and Egyptian intelligence aimed at formulating the truce, but nevertheless approved the assassination. &quot;I think that they have made a strategic mistake,&quot; he said, calling it an error &quot;which will cost the lives of quite a number of innocent people on both sides&quot;. But on the right and centre there was widespread praise for the restoration of Israel&apos;s &quot;deterrent power&quot;, the same argument used by Netanyahu&apos;s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, when he launched Operation Cast Lead in Gaza nearly four years ago. Others complained that the Netanyahu government had been too soft on Gaza. &quot;In the four years that the current coalition has been in power, it has taken no visible steps either to dislodge Hamas from power or, at the very least, to weaken its grip on Gaza,&quot; commented Jonathan Rosen in the Jerusalem Post. Uri Avneri, the peace campaigner and former MP, said Operation Pillar of Defence should be renamed Operation Short Memory, explaining: &quot;Netanyahu counts on people not remembering that four years ago Israel went to war in Gaza, killing 1,300 civilians in three weeks, which otherwise did not make any significant change to the situation. Netanyahu counts on people failing to remember that only yesterday the media reported on people in the communities of the south heaving a sigh of relief at the complete cessation of missiles from Gaza.&quot; Michal Vessey, who lives in a kibbutz close to the Gaza border, wrote in a personal piece in Ha&apos;aretz: &quot;Don&apos;t defend us like this. If you want to defend us, don&apos;t send the army into to &apos;win&apos;. Start thinking in the long term, not just until the next elections. Try to negotiate until we see the white smoke. Extend a hand to Mahmoud Abbas (the PLO leader). Stop the &apos;targeted&apos; killings. Look into the eyes of the civilians on the other side.&quot; Israel Hayom, the free newspaper owned by Netanyahu&apos;s billionaire American Jewish backer, Sheldon Adelson, ran several articles praising the operation. David Buskila, the mayor of Sderot, a small town near the Gaza border which has often been hit by mortar and rocket fire, wrote of his gratitude to the prime minister: &quot;We are all filled with satisfaction and pride that the IDF and the government have taken back the reins and that they will go to war to eliminate the Gaza terror. We deserve to live in peace and tranquility.&quot; Eitan Haber, a confidante of the late Yitzhak Rabin, architect of the ill-fated Oslo accord with the PLO, struck a familiar chord, praising the military and Shin Bet security service for their achievement in eliminating Jaabari and taking out long-range Fajr rockets, but also expressing profound pessimism about the future. &quot;Wednesday&apos;s operation is just another chapter in the book of bloodshed, the beginning of which we no longer remember and the end of which we still can&apos;t see,&quot; Haber wrote in Yediot Aharonot. &quot;It&apos;s an endless war: once in the north, once in the centre, and now \u2013 for several years \u2013 in the south. &quot;There was never, there is no and there will be no military solution for the abscess called the Gaza Strip. If we fail to find the road to a peace agreement, many more of us will still participate in Defence Pillar 2, Defence Pillar 3, and so on.&quot; The Kadima leader Mofaz, a former chief of staff and defence minister, warned against a ground operation inside Gaza.

Israeli television showed panicked residents running for cover when the air-raid sirens sounded. The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for firing a Fajr 5 rocket at the city. &quot;We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,&quot; the group said in a statement.

But there was mounting concern about rising civilian casualties, with the Gaza ministry of health reporting that four children and a woman pregnant with twins were among the dead. It said 130 people had been wounded. Hamas and Israel declared states of emergency. Israeli troops were reported to be moving south in preparation for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. However, the IDF spokeswoman, Avital Leibovitch, indicated that such a move was not imminent, saying it was only an &quot;option&quot; and ground forces were &quot;on alert&quot;. One trigger for an order to launch a ground offensive could be a rocket landing in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second-largest city. Gaza&apos;s militants have never reached the city, which is roughly 50 miles north of the strip. The city of Tel Aviv has a resident population of more than 400,000, but hundreds of thousands of more live in the surrounding area or commute to work there. The Israeli military has its headquarters in the city. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told a press conference the army was preparing for a &quot;significant widening&quot; of its offensive. &quot;No government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire, and Israel will not tolerate this situation,&quot; he said. &quot;This is why my government has instructed the Israeli Defence Forces to conduct surgical strikes against the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. &quot;And this is why Israel will continue to take whatever action is necessary to defend our people.&quot; The military had been instructed to avoid targeting civilians, he added. In a sign that the conflict is straining the Jewish state&apos;s fragile relations with its long-time ally Egypt, an Egyptian delegation, led by the prime minister, Hisham Kandil, is expected to visit Gaza on Friday in an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. President Mohamed Morsi said Israel&apos;s military assault was &quot;unacceptable&quot;, and the Muslim Brotherhood, with which he has strong ties, called on Egypt to sever diplomatic relations. A visit to Gaza by Egyptian officials would signal a significant worsening of relations between the two allies, and would renew fears that the post-revolution government in Cairo may review its 33-year-old peace treaty with Israel. &quot;Prime Minister Hisham Kandil will visit, along with security officials, the Gaza Strip on Friday for a day&apos;s visit to meet with officials there and show solidarity with the Palestinian people,&quot; an Egyptian cabinet official told Reuters news agency. The delegation may include Egypt&apos;s intelligence chief, General Mohamed Raafat Shehata, as well as the prime minister, according to the Reuters report. The Muslim Brotherhood, to which Morsi has close ties, has called for a &quot;Day of Rage&quot; in Arab capitals on Friday. The Brotherhood has strong ideological links with Hamas. Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday in protest at the Israeli air strikes on Gaza. Jordan, another ally of Israel, also condemned the escalating violence along with Qatar, Iran and Syria. The United States criticised Hamas, with Mark Toner, deputy state department spokesman, saying there was &quot;no justification for the violence that Hamas and other terrorist organisations are employing against the people of Israel&quot;. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said: &quot;It would be a catastrophe if there is an escalation in the region. &quot;Israel has the right to security but it will not achieve it through violence. The Palestinians also have the right to a state.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T19:10:03Z", "title": "Israel and Gaza conflict: rocket lands in sea near Tel Aviv", "sentences": ["     The escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza threatens to spiral further out of control after a rocket fired from Gaza reportedly landed in the sea close to Tel Aviv, in a sign that Palestinian militant groups could be deploying long-range weapons from their stockpiled arsenals.", "In a second day of intense bombardment of Gaza and a continuing barrage of rocket fire into Israel, sirens were activated in Tel Aviv for the first time since the 1991 Gulf war to warn residents to take shelter.", "&quot;We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,&quot; the group said in a statement.", "One trigger for an order to launch a ground offensive could be a rocket landing in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second-largest city.", "The city of Tel Aviv has a resident population of more than 400,000, but hundreds of thousands of more live in the surrounding area or commute to work there."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/israel-gaza-rocket-tel-aviv"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Hamas", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "     This is a horror movie we&apos;ve seen before. In the days following a US\u00a0presidential contest, an Israeli government, about to face an election of its own, decides it can tolerate Hamas rocket-fire no longer. It hits back hard, determined to show the Israeli public that it is not sitting idle as a million of its citizens huddle in bomb shelters, their children unable to go to school, but that it is tough, ready to do whatever it takes to &quot;restore deterrence&quot;. It will bring quiet to its southern towns by forcing Hamas to fear its wrath once more. As it was after Barack Obama&apos;s election in 2008, so it is after his re-election in 2012. Four years ago, Operation Cast Lead was meant to root out &quot;the infrastructure of terror&quot; from Gaza, eradicating the Hamas threat. It did nothing of the sort, of course. Hamas was left in control, its threat merely postponed. The evidence came in the last three months as missiles landed in Israel in greater numbers \u2013 130 in the last few days alone. So once again, Israel decided\u00a0to fight fire with fire, assassinating Hamas&apos;s senior military commander, Ahmed Ja&apos;abari. To understand how we got here, why tension turned into confrontation, and why at this moment, we need answers to two questions. First, why did Hamas allow Gaza once again to become a rocket launchpad, given that it has successfully imposed quiet during various periods since 2009? And why did Israel choose to get tough now, given that it has been willing to respond more mildly to such provocations in the past? Start with Hamas. One reading assumes that Hamas was punished for its weakness, that it had proved itself no longer capable of reining in the more bellicose groups \u2013 Islamic Jihad and others \u2013 which operate on the territory it rules. The Haaretz editor, Aluf Benn, put that view starkly when he wrote that far from being a feared enemy, Israel&apos;s Osama bin Laden, Ja&apos;abari was Israel&apos;s &quot;subcontractor&quot; in Gaza, charged with enforcing the de facto truce. When he stopped doing his job, he had to be removed: &quot;The message was simple and clear: You failed \u2013 you&apos;re dead,&quot; wrote Benn, quoting a favourite saying of defence minister Ehud Barak: &quot;In the\u00a0Middle East there is no second chance for the weak.&quot; But it&apos;s equally possible that this was no accidental escalation by Hamas, born of incompetence, but rather an act of strength by the Islamist movement. A senior Israeli official told me that Israel had long been aware of Hamas&apos;s burgeoning military capacity, its hoard of rockets growing \u2013 before Wednesday \u2013 to some 11,000, closing on the 15,000-strong arsenal amassed by Hezbollah on the eve of 2006&apos;s Lebanon war. Much of this arms supply had come from newly lawless Libya \u2013 a &quot;goldmine&quot; says the official \u2013 the rest from Iran, before relations between Tehran and Hamas cooled. (Iran was angered when Gaza&apos;s rulers broke from Tehran&apos;s number one ally, the Assad regime.) Hamas&apos;s arm is now more muscled and with a longer reach, as it graphically demonstrated last night, when rockets landed perilously close to Israel&apos;s central city, Tel Aviv \u2013 the first missiles to do so since the Gulf war of 1991. But Hamas&apos;s new strength is diplomatic, as well as military. The Arab revolutions have redrawn the regional map, much of it in Hamas&apos;s favour. Once a pariah, Hamas now sees its own movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, ruling Egypt. Where Hosni Mubarak played broker between Israel and Gaza, often seeking to stay Hamas&apos;s hand, Cairo&apos;s new rulers feel a grassroots pressure to stand as the ally of Hamas. Witness the Egyptian president&apos;s swift despatch of his prime minister to visit Gaza on Friday. What&apos;s more, the Gaza-based leadership has been engaged in a power struggle with the Hamas politburo outside the Strip. Taking the fight to Israel, becoming &quot;the tip of the spear,&quot; as analyst Hussein Ibish puts it, is Gaza-based Hamas&apos;s way of asserting its pre-eminence. What, though, of that second question: why did Israel hit back now? The Hebrew press immediately assumed the key date was political, not military: 22 January, when Israelis go to the polls. There are plenty of precedents for\u00a0outgoing governments taking military action, hoping to create a wave of national unity that will carry them to victory: Cast Lead itself fits that pattern. Binyamin Netanyahu may well have wanted to push aside his Labor rival and\u00a0prevent his predecessor, Ehud\u00a0Olmert, making a planned comeback \u2013 forcing both to fall into line as patriotic cheerleaders. Similarly, Barak found a\u00a0way to remind voters of his supposed indispensability. Israeli officials deny any such thing, arguing that Netanyahu is too seasoned a pro to take such a high risk. He knows military adventures can backfire, and when they do, voters turn on the men who gave the orders. If Tel Aviv remains under attack, he will be in severe danger. The risks go far beyond the small matter of Netanyahu&apos;s career. If Cairo translates its solidarity with Hamas into concrete action, Israel&apos;s post-1979 peace with Egypt will be imperilled. Since no one else is about to take over in Gaza, Hamas\u00a0will remain in charge, very possibly strengthened \u2013 all the more so if the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority is seen to fail in its nonviolent attempt to win quasi-statehood at the UN general assembly. Above all, the pain and anguish inflicted by yet another round of civilian deaths and injury will sow hatred in the hearts of another generation, who will grow up bent on revenge and yet more bloodshed. This keeps happening, decade after decade, for one simple reason: there can be no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both sides will say the action they have taken is necessary. But it will solve nothing.

A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was apparently being negotiated, through Egyptian intelligence, when the decision to kill Jabari was taken. Jabari, a man who undoubtedly dedicated his life to war against Israel, was also the man who enforced the truce for the last five and a half years over armed groups in the strip. One man involved in the mediation to release Gilad Shalit claimed that hours before he was assassinated Jabari received the draft of a permanent truce agreement. War is never so near when peace is on offer. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, learned this lesson while trying to mediate peace talks\u00a0between Syria and Ehud Olmert, just before Operation Cast Lead was launched at the end of 2008. Whatever was going on immediately before the strike on Jabari, a ceasefire has been negotiated after each outbreak of hostilities with Gaza militants. What was different this time? The proximity of the Likud primaries and the general elections in Israel undoubtedly played a role. The attacks on Lebanon in 1996 and Gaza in 2008/9 both happened on the eve of elections, although military action turned into electoral defeat. But at the time the opportunity to turn a drama into a crisis was too good to miss. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been deprived both of a strike on Iran and a Republican president in the White House. An attack on Gaza re-established his national security credentials while wiping all possible rivals off the television screens, particularly the possible comeback of former premier Olmert, whose boast, too, was that he &quot;took care&quot; of Gaza. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, is fighting for votes just to get back into the Knesset. The third calculation is the riskiest of the lot. It is not to test Hamas or to re-establish deterrence over other militant groups in Gaza. It is to test Egypt. The biggest difference between the current attack on Gaza and all the other ones is that today the regional furniture has changed. One of the two countries with which Israel had signed a peace treaty has gone through a revolution, bringing Islamists to power, and the other, Jordan, is being rattled by the same forces to its very bones. Kuwait, Bahrain, the Emirates, and parts of Saudi Arabia are all gripped by the same fever. The working assumption was that the further and deeper the Arab spring spread, the more Israel would have to temper the urge to hammer militants in Gaza with the need to keep its peace treaty intact with Egypt. With the call-up of reservists and missiles striking close to Tel Aviv, that theory is now being tested to destruction. It has already led to one diplomatic consequence. For the first time since the siege of Gaza started, an Egyptian prime minister, Hisham Qandil, will on Friday visit Gaza. The Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, is right to be furious. He had done everything, from his point of view, to avoid a confrontation with Israel this early in his presidency. He launched a military operation against militants using Sinai to attack Israel. He began to seal up the tunnels under the Rafah border with Gaza, and limited the opening hours of the border crossing itself. This was the triumph of pragmatism over belief, because it made for very bad politics back home. Behind Morsi stands a tidal wave of anti-Israeli resentment from the Arab street, both Islamist and secular, of which Israeli diplomats had a small taste when they had to be rescued from a mob in Cairo. Try as Morsi might to avoid having to open the Pandora&apos;s box of the treaty with Israel, that now is the direction in which he is being pushed. The Arab spring skirted around the central fire in the Middle East: Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel&apos;s actions have wheeled it straight back onto centre stage.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T22:09:57Z", "title": "Attack on Gaza: Egypt's biggest challenge yet | Editorial", "sentences": ["With the call-up of reservists and missiles striking close to Tel Aviv, that theory is now being tested to destruction."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/15/attack-gaza-egypt-challenge-editorial"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "US foreign policy", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Egypt", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Barack Obama is pressing the Egyptian leadership to help de-escalate the bloody conflict in Gaza amid concern that a further ratcheting up of violence, such as a major Israeli ground assault, could damage the peace accords between Cairo and Jerusalem. The Egyptian prime minister, Hisham Kandil, is expected to lead a delegation to Gaza on Friday for talks with Hamas leaders on quelling the fighting which has escalated with the Israeli assassination of the Hamas military leader, Ahmed Jabari, and the firing of hundreds of rockets from Gaza into Israel. The fighting has now claimed civilian lives on both sides.  On Thursday, the conflict threatened to escalate further as the Israelis stepped up their intense bombardment of Gaza and Hamas continued its barrage of rocket fire into Israel. Three people were killed and three children injured when a rocket hit their apartment block in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Malachi. Another rocket struck close to the city of Rishon Lezion, 22 miles north of Gaza, one of almost 150 fired from the enclave on Thursday. In Gaza, there was mounting concern about rising civilian casualties, with the ministry of health reporting that four children and a woman pregnant with twins were among the dead. It said 130 people had been wounded. By late afternoon, Israeli jets were continuing, and Hamas said the death toll had reached at least 19. Israeli troops were reported to be moving south in preparation for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. However, the IDF spokeswoman, Avital Leibovitch, indicated that such a move was not imminent, saying it was only an &quot;option&quot; and that ground forces were &quot;on alert&quot;.

Gaza&apos;s militants have never reached the city, which is roughly 50 miles north of the strip. But on Thursday, a rocket fired from Gaza reportedly landed in the sea close to the city. The Egyptian prime minister&apos;s visit to Gaza follows a call by Obama to the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, on Wednesday in which the US president urged him not to take any action that could cause a further deterioration in relations with Israel and threaten the Camp David peace accords, according to diplomatic sources. &quot;The American focus is getting the Egyptians to pull Hamas back, and making sure the Egyptians themselves do not do anything precipitous that could seriously damage the peace accords,&quot; said a western diplomat in the region. &quot;The Americans recognise that there has to be a certain latitude for Morsi because he faces his own pressures to take a tougher stand with Israel. &quot;But they want to make sure it doesn&apos;t get to a point where the peace accords are under threat, and an escalation in Gaza could push it down that path. Washington is co-opting the Egyptians into making peace not only to get Hamas to rein it in, but to stop the Egyptians themselves from taking it over the cliff.&quot; The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, spoke to the Egyptian foreign minister, Mohamed Kamel Amr, to press home the message. Amr called on the US to put pressure on the Israelis to halt the assault on Gaza, the foreign ministry said. Morsi is maintaining a firm line in public, pulling the Egyptian ambassador out of Israel and calling an emergency meeting of the Arab League. &quot;Israel needs to understand that we won&apos;t accept the aggression that negatively affects the security and stability of the region,&quot; Morsi said on Thursday at the end of a meeting on the crisis. The Egyptian foreign ministry handed a letter to the Israeli embassy in Cairo expressing &quot;strong condemnation&quot; of the military strikes on Gaza. Obama also spoke to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, on Wednesday.  Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East negotiator and now vice-president of the Wilson Centre, said he expects Obama to have appealed to the Israelis not to push the assault too far. &quot;The message to the Israelis is clearly restraint, give the Egyptians time to work this. Nobody has an interest in escalation,&quot; he said. Publicly, the US administration has firmly backed Israel over the Gaza conflict. The White House blamed Hamas and other armed Islamic groups for &quot;cowardly&quot; attacks and said in a statement about the president&apos;s call to Netanyahu that Obama reiterated &quot;the United States&apos;s support for Israel&apos;s right to self-defence in light of the barrage of rocket attacks being launched from Gaza against Israeli civilians&quot;. Miller said Obama will remain unwavering in his support of Israel \u2013 not just in Gaza but on diplomatic issues such as opposition to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas&apos;s plan to ask the UN general assembly to recognise Palestinian statehood later this month \u2013 despite criticism from Morsi that Washington siding with the Jewish state has damaged US interests in the Middle East. &quot;If Obama has any hope of promoting an Israeli Palestinian initiative down the road, he&apos;s going to have to remain in lock step with the current Israeli government on two issues \u2013 opposing Abbas&apos;s efforts on recognition New York and taking a very very tough line on Israeli security,&quot; said Miller. &quot;There&apos;ll be latitude in giving the Israelis a lot of leeway in terms of the disproportionality of whatever response they undertake in Gaza.&quot; But behind the scenes Obama is having to tread carefully with Morsi who has been more forcefully critical of Israel than his predecessor, the deposed ruler, Hosni Mubarak. Morsi has said Egypt will continue to respect the peace accords but has also said Israel has not fulfilled its obligations \u2013 a claim that has caused concern in Washington that the long term stability of the agreement may be undermined. In criticising the US for taking sides with Israel against the Palestinians, the Egyptian leader singled out Washington&apos;s &quot;failure&quot; to ensure Israel&apos;s compliance with what he said is a requirement in the Camp David agreement for it withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories. &quot;As long as peace and justice are not fulfilled for the Palestinians, then the treaty remains unfulfilled,&quot; he told the New York Times in September. The Egyptian president has also been strongly critical of Obama&apos;s failure to live up to the president&apos;s early promise of a shift in US policy in the Middle East and warned that it continues to foster anti-American sentiment in the Arab world. Obama has contributed to the cooling of the relationship after the close ties between the Mubarak regime and the US by saying that he regards the present Egyptian administration as neither an ally nor an enemy. But Miller said that Obama is also in a position to exert pressure on Morsi to ensure the peace treaty is not undermined by the Gaza conflict or broader political pressures, not least over Egypt&apos;s position as one of the largest recipients of US aid. &quot;We&apos;ve got a $4.5bn IMF loan to Egypt under consideration and Morsi wants our help with that. Why is there massive assistance to Egypt? It grew out of the peace treaty. Without that peace treaty, the chances of our treating Egypt as a special case are going to diminish dramatically,&quot; he said. &quot;Morsi has a much more proactive agenda which is to actively work to make an already cold peace colder. Ultimately he could get away with it, to redefine the nature of the Egyptian-Israeli relationship which he doesn&apos;t like. The potential upside is that if Morsi&apos;s role is a positive one in defusing this crisis, it would serve to inject a fair amount of stability in the Egyptian-Israeli relationship right now because under a Muslim Brotherhood president, every day that peace treaty exists it&apos;s legitimised.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T22:50:00Z", "title": "Obama presses Egypt to help rein in Hamas as Gaza conflict escalates", "sentences": ["One trigger for an order to launch a ground offensive could be a rocket landing in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second-largest city."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/obama-egypt-diplomatic-gaza-conflict-escalate"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Egypt"], "article": "     Egypt&apos;s prime minister, Hisham Kandil, has arrived in Gaza, as Israel and Palestinian militants continue to exchange fire.

But on a visit to a Gaza hospital, he blamed Israel for the conflict. &quot;This tragedy cannot pass in silence and the world should take responsibility in stopping this aggression,&quot; he said. Rockets fired from Gaza hit several sites in southern Israel on Friday morning, shortly after Kandil arrived in the Palestinian enclave. The Israeli air force responded with an attack on the house of Hamas&apos;s commander for southern Gaza, a Hamas source told Reuters. Medics said the air strike killed two people, one of them a child, raising the Palestinian death toll since Wednesday to 21. Three Israelis were killed by a rocket on Thursday. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, wrote on Twitter: &quot;Hamas does not respect the Egyptian prime minister&apos;s visit to Gaza and violates the temporary ceasefire that Israel agreed to during the visit.&quot; Israel had previously said it was prepared to suspend its military offensive during Kandil&apos;s three-hour visit if militant groups also stopped firing rockets. Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood-led government has said a truce is the only option, but officials in Cairo warned privately that there was no immediate prospect of an end to the Israeli operation, saying the conflict could continue for at least another week. Overnight, Israeli war planes pounded Gaza with around 150 air strikes, causing massive explosions in the main cities and sending plumes of black smoke into the sky. The Israeli Defence Forces said it had targeted rocket-launching sites and arms depots, &quot;causing severe damage to terror infrastructures&quot;. In a sign that Israel is preparing to further escalate Operation Pillar of Defence, the military said it was calling up 16,000 reservists, after receiving permission to draft up to 30,000. Netanyahu has said a ground invasion of Gaza cannot be ruled out. On Thursday evening, two rockets from Gaza crashed near Tel Aviv, the first such attack on Israel&apos;s commercial capital in 20 years. One fell into the Mediterranean Sea (video) and the other in an uninhabited part of a suburb south of the city.           Until Friday, Israeli air strikes had killed 19 Palestinians, including seven militants and 12 civilians, among them six children and a pregnant woman. A Hamas rocket killed three Israelis in the town of Kiryat Malachi on Thursday morning. The latest surge in the long-running conflict came on Wednesday when Israel killed Hamas&apos;s military mastermind, Ahmed al-Jabari, in a precision air strike on his car. Israel then began shelling the coastal enclave from land, air and sea. Israel says its offensive was in response to increasing missile salvoes from Gaza. The bombing has not yet reached the saturation level seen before it last invaded Gaza in 2008. Air raid sirens sent residents running for shelter in Tel Aviv. The metropolitan area is home to more than 3 million people, more than 40% of Israel&apos;s population. &quot;This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay,&quot; the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, said in a television broadcast shortly after the strike. An Israeli cabinet statement on Wednesday spoke only of &quot;improving&quot; national security. At the same time in Gaza, the Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, urged Egypt to do more to help the Palestinians. &quot;We call upon the brothers in Egypt to take the measures that will deter this enemy,&quot; he said. The resurgent conflict will be the biggest test yet of the commitment of the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, to Egypt&apos;s 1979 peace treaty with Israel, which the west views as the bedrock of Middle East peace. Cairo recalled its ambassador from Israel on Wednesday. Israel&apos;s ambassador left Cairo on what was called a routine home visit, but Israel said its embassy would remain open. The Muslim Brotherhood, which brought Morsi to power in an election after the downfall of Hosni Mubarak, has called for a &quot;day of rage&quot; in Arab capitals on Friday. The Brotherhood is seen as the spiritual mentor of Hamas. Israeli war planes have dropped leaflets in Gaza advising residents to stay away from Hamas and other militants.

Hamas said it had launched the long-range missile as air raid sirens sounded across the city at the start of Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. It claimed it was targeting the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed that a rocket struck on the city outskirts \u2013 believed to be the settlement block of Gush Etzion \u2013 causing no injuries. A photograph published by the Palestinian news agency, Maan, showed rocket vapour trails in the sky above Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem. The city, which Israel claims as its &quot;eternal and indivisible capital&quot; and which is home to some of the holiest sites in the Islamic, Jewish and Christian faiths, is about 50 miles from Gaza \u2013 the maximum reach of the most powerful rockets in the militants&apos; arsenals. Hamas described the missile as &quot;an improved Qassam&quot; named an M-75. Earlier, sirens were activated for the second day in Tel Aviv and some residents reported hearing the &quot;muffled boom&quot; of an explosion. The Tel Aviv authorities said they were opening bomb shelters across the city. Israel says militant groups in Gaza have taken possession of a large number of powerful weapons smuggled from Libya in recent months, including Fajr-5s, which have a range of up to 50 miles. Last month, a Russian-made Strela anti-aircraft missile was fired for the first time at an Israeli helicopter over Gaza, but missed. As stakes in the conflict rose for the third day, the IDF said about 550 rockets had been fired from Gaza since the start of its military offensive against Gaza, called Operation Pillar of Defence, on Wednesday. A third of the missiles had been intercepted by its Iron Dome defence system. The Israelis hit more than 600 targets in Gaza over the same period. Eighty-five targets were hit in 45 minutes in the early hours of Friday morning in one of the most intensive periods of bombardment since the offensive began. Speculation about an imminent ground invasion mounted as tanks were seen stationed close to the Gaza border. The IDF has begun calling up 16,000 reservists, and the defence minister, Ehud Barak, authorised the military to extend the number to 30,000. Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, told the BBC that a ground invasion could cost Israel international support. &quot;Israel does have to bear in mind that it is when ground invasions have taken place in previous conflicts that they have lost international support and a great deal of sympathy around the world.&quot; The Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, pledged that his country would &quot;not leave Gaza on its own&quot; and denounced Israel&apos;s offensive as &quot;a blatant aggression against humanity&quot;. In a statement which will increase western concern that the conflict in Gaza is hardening anti-Israel sentiment in post-revolutionary Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East, he added: &quot;Egypt today is not the Egypt of yesterday, and Arabs today are not the Arabs of yesterday.&quot; His prime minister, Hesham Kandil, reiterated the message during a short visit to Gaza aimed at showing solidarity with the people. &quot;The Egyptian people are supporting you. The Egyptian revolution will be side by side with the Palestinian people. The world should take responsibility in stopping this aggression,&quot; said Kandil. Their comments came amid growing public anger in Egypt over Israel&apos;s military operation targeting Gaza, which was condemned in speeches in mosques and demonstrations. Protesters marched in the country&apos;s two largest cities, Cairo and Alexandria, waving Palestinian flags and chanting slogans against Israel. Preaching at the al-Azhar mosque in Cairo, the prominent cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who was long barred from Egypt, likened Israel&apos;s attack to Bashar al-Assad&apos;s use of violence in Syria. &quot;We say to the tyrant Israel, the day of your end is coming soon,&quot; he told a crowd, some of whom were wearing Palestinian scarves or carrying banners. Other voices were more nuanced, reflecting the deep conflicts that many Egyptians feel in their country&apos;s relationship with Israel, with which it signed the Camp David peace treaty in 1979. Under former leader Hosni Mubarak Egypt had become used to acting as a mediator between Palestinian groups \u2013 including those in Gaza \u2013 and Israel, a role the new Muslim Brotherhood-led government has continued to pursue, despite promising to take a harder line. Following the assault on Gaza, there has been evidence that the Brotherhood is being forced to be more assertive. The crisis over Gaza is the first major foreign policy challenge for Egypt&apos;s Islamist administration, which is complicated by the Muslim Brotherhood&apos;s close historic ties with Gaza&apos;s ruling Hamas movement. Since the Egyptian revolution, the Brotherhood has been in a political bind over its treaty with Israel, coming under pressure from more radical parties, such as the Salafist al-Nour party and secular leftwing groups to get tougher with Israel.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T17:16:12Z", "title": "Gaza rocket lands close to Jerusalem", "sentences": ["Earlier, sirens were activated for the second day in Tel Aviv and some residents reported hearing the &quot;muffled boom&quot; of an explosion.", "The Tel Aviv authorities said they were opening bomb shelters across the city."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/gaza-rocket-lands-close-jerusalem"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Weapons technology", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "Technology", "Iran", "Science", "Hamas"], "article": "In a straight fight between Israel and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip there is no question who has the upper hand. Israel&apos;s armed forces are among the world&apos;s most sophisticated. Their ability to mount a drone strike of the kind that killed the Hamas military leader Ahmed Jaabari on Wednesday attests to a deadly combination of precise weaponry and accurate intelligence. But in the latest round of the conflict the Palestinians have used a weapon which gives them a rare if short-lived advantage \u2013 a rocket which can strike at Israel&apos;s civilian heartland. This is the Fajr-5, developed by Iran and also supplied to Hezbollah, Tehran&apos;s Lebanese ally. It has a range of up to 46.6 miles (75km), which means it can hit Tel Aviv and elsewhere in the heavily populated conurbation in central Israel. Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, announced on Wednesday that Israel had destroyed most of these missiles in air attacks during the first hour of its continuing offensive. But Islamic Jihad, another militant Palestinian faction, said on Thursday that it had launched a Fajr-5 at Tel Aviv, triggering the city&apos;s first air raid alert since it was hit by Iraqi Scuds during the 1991 Gulf war. Barak went on TV to warn that Gaza would pay &quot;a heavy price for this escalation&quot;. The missile is not a game-changer, but it does even out the stakes. Moshe Yaalon, Israel&apos;s deputy prime minister, signalled on Friday that the Palestinian arsenal was now more or less depleted. &quot;I don&apos;t know if they still have one or two missiles left,&quot; he said. &quot;But they don&apos;t have a stockpile that can threaten central Israel.&quot; Firing those that remained, suggested the global intelligence analyst Stratfor, was a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; strategy. The Fajr (&quot;dawn&quot; in Arabic) is in a different league from shorter-range rockets like the homemade Qassam \u2013 built in workshops in Gaza \u2013 with ranges of up to a dozen or so kilometres. Qassam variants have repeatedly hit towns in southern Israel since 2005. Missiles that hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Friday were described as Qassam M75s. Grad missiles, also thought to have been supplied by Iran, have a range of up to about 20km. It was striking that Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah&apos;s leader, singled out the Iranian-made weapon in a speech in Beirut on Thursday. &quot;The firing of Fajr-5 rockets on Tel Aviv shows the maturation, the wisdom and strength, and the courage of the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip,&quot; he said. &quot;The Israeli enemy was surprised and forced to acknowledge that its capital had been hit.&quot; Exactly how the Fajr-5 reached Gaza is not known. But its parts were probably smuggled in through the tunnels that link the blockaded enclave to the outside world. In October 2011 international observers in Sinai reported that one had been test-fired in the desert. Israel has devoted considerable diplomatic, military and intelligence resources to halting the flow of weapons of all kinds into Gaza, but especially those supplied by Iran. In January 2010 presumed agents from the Mossad murdered in Dubai Mohammed Mabhouh, the Hamas arms procurement liaison with Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards. The previous year Israel warplanes attacked a large convoy in Sudan. Only last month Israel was accused of bombing the Yarmouk arms factory in Khartoum, said to be owned by Iran. It all but admitted that it was responsible. Israel has made no secret of its concern that weapons have also flowed from Libya, via Egypt and Sudan, into Gaza, since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi last year. These are mostly SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles and rocket-propelled grenades, less significant militarily than the Fajr-5. In May the head of Israel&apos;s Shin Bet security service, Yoram Cohen, called Libya &quot;a new gate to hell&quot;, because of the weapons reaching Hamas and other Palestinian groups in Gaza. Israel has tried in recent months to persuade Egypt, far less friendly since Mohammed Morsi&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood government replaced Hosni Mubarak, to choke off these supplies.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T18:23:15Z", "title": "Fajr-5 missile gives Palestinians rare if short-lived advantage", "sentences": ["It has a range of up to 46.6 miles (75km), which means it can hit Tel Aviv and elsewhere in the heavily populated conurbation in central Israel.", "But Islamic Jihad, another militant Palestinian faction, said on Thursday that it had launched a Fajr-5 at Tel Aviv, triggering the city&apos;s first air raid alert since it was hit by Iraqi Scuds during the 1991 Gulf war.", "Missiles that hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Friday were described as Qassam M75s.", "&quot;The firing of Fajr-5 rockets on Tel Aviv shows the maturation, the wisdom and strength, and the courage of the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip,&quot; he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/fajr5-missile-gaza-israel-iran"}, {"tags": ["Anglicanism", "Christianity", "Religion", "London", "UK news", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Towards the end of the circular, descending corridor of the beautifully designed Yitzhak Rabin museum high up overlooking Tel Aviv, there exists a space for quiet reflection. Given that Rabin was not a religious man, words for that space are supplied by the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai: &quot;From the place where we are right, flowers will never grow in the spring.&quot; Few sentiments can be so badly needed in modern Israeli politics. &quot;The place where we are right is hard and trampled, like a yard.&quot; This is the place where a passionate, sometimes religious, always compacted sense of what is right serves to ensure that nothing ever changes. And in terms of Israel and Palestine, nothing changing means more rockets and more coffins. Amichai&apos;s insistence that we must press beyond our own righteousness is clearly exemplified by the life and death of Rabin himself, gunned down by an Orthodox Jewish settler in November 1995 who opposed Rabin&apos;s peacemaking with the Palestinians. Rabin was no naive peacenik. As minister of defence he defended the use of live ammunition against unarmed Palestinian protesters. But by the early 90s he realised there could never be a military solution to the political troubles of Israel and Palestine. Peace could only ever be reached by compromise. The sort of compromise that some would paint as a surrender of principles. Which is partly why, for all Rabin&apos;s status as a hero for peace, it was his arch rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, who won the public argument. The week before the assassination, Netanyahu had been speaking at a rally in Jerusalem opposing the Oslo peace deal. Posters depicted Rabin in an SS uniform and set in the crosshairs of a rifle. Netanyahu described Rabin as &quot;removed from Jewish values&quot;. And at the election that followed, it was Netanyahu, under the campaign banner &quot;making a safe peace&quot;, that emerged as prime minister. A succession of Hamas suicide bombings scared the public into a vote for hawkish military security. Netanyahu&apos;s uncompromising steadfastness felt like a stand of principle. Not, of course, that hawkishness has delivered the safe peace Netanyahu promised. Hamas still fire their rockets, now falling closer to Tel Aviv itself. And Israel&apos;s military response serves only to transform the little boys of Gaza into the next generation of &quot;martyrs&quot;. The hawkish idea that peace is established by the big stick fails to understand that violence is mimetic, one act of violence sowing the seeds for the next. We are in another of these cycles now: bombs, fear and elections. Little has changed. The novelist Amos Oz has always convinced me with his analysis of the situation, which fits well with that of Amichai. The war between Israelis and Palestinians is not a war between goodies and baddies \u2013 though there are countless ways of describing recent history to justify the demonisation of either side. That&apos;s the battle over the place where we are right. But, for Oz, the war is not about right versus wrong, but, much more tragically, right versus right: a horrendous dispute between two peoples who both have, in different ways, legitimate claims on territory in a crowded part of the world. In such circumstances, what is required is a divorce. Of course it will be horrendous, especially as both parties will continue to occupy the same house after separation. Poets understand tragedy better than politicians. For what makes tragedy tragic is not that the situation is sad (there are other words for that) but that it is where the sloganising binaries of right and wrong no longer function as a useful guide. Which is why making peace means leaving the protected place where we are right.

A jogger running past the police lines marking off the seaside area where the first rocket in 20 years is thought to have landed praised his government&apos;s offensive against the Palestinians. &quot;What I think needs to be done is, we need take out the elite of the terrorists,&quot; said Alon Sivan, briefly slowing his pace to answer questions. &quot;Sure, it&apos;s scary, but not enough to make me change the course of my day. I don&apos;t think we should change the course of our lives.&quot; Sivan said he expected to be called up as a reservist to serve in the Gaza offensive. Many of his friends have already been called to their units. &quot;I can honestly say I feel very, very bad for the people [in Gaza],&quot; he added. His defiance was echoed on the streets of Tel Aviv, although not everyone shared his sympathy for the Palestinian victims. &quot;I hope this time they will finish them once and for all. I don&apos;t care if it takes two years,&quot; said Eliran Bonfile, walking his dog back from picking up some groceries at a nearby shop. He said he had been on the patio of a cafe when the rocket hit in the afternoon but had not bothered to go to a shelter. &quot;I&apos;m pretty used to the situation in my country. People think Tel Aviv is like another country outside of Israel and we are going to freak out. But they forget we went through suicide bombings on buses for years,&quot; said Bonfile. Thousands of rockets have been fired into southern Israel since 2007, but this is the first time Islamist militants in Gaza have fired rockets with sufficient range to reach Tel Aviv and its outlying dormitory cities. Alarms have sounded twice in the city since Israel assassinated Hamas&apos;s military chief on Wednesday \u2013 once on Thursday at 6.30pm and once at about 1pm on Friday. But Eytan Schwartz, an adviser to the mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Hulda, said it was business as usual in the city, which has a metropolitan area with more than 3 million residents. &quot;We&apos;ve opened the public [bomb] shelters,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot;But other than that there have been no special measures.&quot; Most homes in Tel Aviv have built-in bomb shelters under a decades-old law, but some older buildings lack such shelters and safe rooms, so their residents must rely on public shelters. Not since the Gulf War has Tel Aviv felt the threat of rockets and Schwartz said that many of these public underground shelters did not exist then. In recent years, he said, underground parking lots had been modified because of the threat from Iran, not Palestinian militants. &quot;Life is back to normal,&quot; he said. &quot;People are going out to the clubs \u2026 the market is open. We are not going to give in to terrorists.&quot; At a restaurant a few blocks from the police lines, the staff were watching the news about the conflict.

The Palestinian delegation to Washington condemned the US response to the crisis as &quot;biased and weak&quot;, and called on the White House to stop Israel using American-made weapons against civilians. It also described as &quot;shameful&quot; what it called the justification of the murder of Palestinians by countries supporting Israeli actions, including Britain. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, called the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers, Avigdor Lieberman and Mohamed Kamel Amr, on Friday to urge a de-escalation of a &quot;very, very dangerous situation&quot; in Gaza, according the State Department.  Oren spoke during a visit to Capitol Hill on Friday after both houses of Congress overwhelmingly voted for resolutions in support of Israel&apos;s &quot;inherent right to act in self-defence&quot;.  &quot;The United States has given us the full backing to take whatever measures are necessary to defend our citizens from Hamas terror,&quot; he said. &quot;Israel has received unequivocal and outstanding support from the United States and all branches of government. From the White House, from Congress, in both parties, completely bipartisan support.&quot;  Among the few voices of criticism raised was from congressman Keith Ellison, who said he visited Gaza after the last major Israeli attack four years ago.  &quot;It&apos;s a devastated area already. It&apos;s only going to be made worse by this. Innocent people are dying. We need a ceasefire,&quot; he said. The Israeli ambassador has been leading a PR drive in Washington to cast Israel as the innocent victim of indiscriminate terror attacks, a claim strongly challenged by Palestinians who accuse Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, of engineering the conflict as a political strategy in the run-up to January&apos;s general election. Oren has likened the situation to 1948, during Israel&apos;s war to establish its independence, and 1967, when a strike against Arab armies resulted in a swift victory that led to the occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He said Hamas has been &quot;emboldened&quot; by the Arab spring and that it is being armed with weapons from Libya, Sudan and groups in the Sinai.  Oren called the news that a rocket fired from Gaza landed within a few miles of Jerusalem an &quot;escalation&quot; in the crisis.  &quot;We are prepared to take any and all measures to defend our citizens, including measures in the air and on the ground \u2026 Israeli ground forces have been moved to the border. There has been no crossing of the border to date, but those forces are deployed and ready to act, be there a need,&quot; he said. That position was unequivocally backed by the congressional resolutions without the call made by the Obama administration for Israel to show restraint and avoid civilian casualties.  The two houses of Congress expressed &quot;unwavering commitment to the security of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders, and recognises and strongly supports its inherent right to act in self-defence to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism&quot;.  The influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) said the resolutions &quot;demonstrate that America continues to firmly stand with Israel and her right to defend herself&quot;. The Palestinian delegation to the US accused Washington of taking Israel&apos;s side. &quot;The United States response is at best biased and weak because it completely ignored the fact that Israel started the escalation. The US has a moral obligation to ask Israel not to deploy its US-made weapons to kill and injure civilians. The US is also expected to tell Israel that there is no military solution to the conflict. The only way to achieve peace is to uproot the cause of its absence: Israel&apos;s military occupation of Palestine,&quot; it said. &quot;It is shameful that certain countries are justifying the murder of Palestinian civilians. It is time for all to understand that Palestinian lives are as precious as any others in the region and around the world. The political complicity must end and Israel must be held accountable.&quot; Part of Oren&apos;s push has been to win US public support with numerous television and radio interviews in which he has said that Israelis cowering from rockets fired from Gaza is equivalent to 40 million Americans having to hide in bunkers. Israeli diplomats have also compared Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza to Miami being shelled from Cuba. Critics pointed out that Cuba is not occupied by the US.  Oren also pushed a frequently heard line that civilian casualties during Israeli attacks are the fault of Hamas, which uses them for PR purposes. &quot;We are acutely aware that Hamas and other terrorist organisations embed their missiles, embed their troops and other military assets deep within the civilian populations and they&apos;re doing their best to hid behind the civilian populations, using them as human shields,&quot; he said. &quot;We are making superhuman efforts to avoid civilian casualties.&quot; Palestinian officials have noted that Israel maintains its military headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T22:10:25Z", "title": "US gives 'full backing' to Israel while urging de-escalation of Gaza violence", "sentences": ["&quot;We are making superhuman efforts to avoid civilian casualties.&quot; Palestinian officials have noted that Israel maintains its military headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/us-full-backing-israel-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Music", "BBC Symphony Orchestra", "Royal Academy of Music", "Conducting"], "article": "The engagement diary of a leading conductor can reveal many things: musical taste, status, popularity with players, administrators and audiences. But rarely has a schedule acted so neatly as a potted biography as Semyon Bychkov&apos;s does this month. November&apos;s concerts have included performances in St Petersburg (where he was brought up and trained as a musician), Vienna (where he arrived in 1974 with $100 to his name as a Jewish exile from the Soviet Union), the US (where he made his home and established his musical reputation), Tel Aviv and London (where he has recently been awarded honorary positions with both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Academy of Music). &quot;I wish I could say it was all a magnificent design,&quot; he shrugs, &quot;but there was no design. However, when the pattern was pointed out to me, the symbolism was unmistakeable.&quot; That Bychkov&apos;s 60th birthday also falls this month adds to the seeming import of these trips down his personal memory lanes. &quot;It is interesting that all this comes around the time of an apparently significant birthday, when it is common to look both forward and back,&quot; he says. &quot;Over the years I have played music I have often felt that my relationship with time is a little strange. The past and the present do sometimes come together in the most unexpected ways.&quot; The day after he arrived in Vienna in 1974 Bychkov found himself standing in front of the Staastsoper watching the audience go in to see a new production of Wagner&apos;s Lohengrin. Thirty years later to the day, he was the conductor of a new Staatsoper Lohengrin. His prize as an outstanding student in Leningrad was to conduct Rachmaninoff&apos;s second symphony with the Leningrad Philharmonic, but his application for an exit visa ensured that the authorities stopped the concert. On his first return visit to his conservatoire in the city 35 years later, this was the piece he conducted. Born in Leningrad in 1952, Bychkov was part of a remarkable musical family; his younger brother was the conductor Yakov Kreizberg, who later became estranged from the family and died last year, aged 51. By the age of six Bychkov was giving piano concerts. He attended the Glinka Choir school and then applied, aged only 17, for the conducting course at the Leningrad Conservatoire. &quot;The piano was my instrument, but from the beginning my ambitions were not married to a desire to become a pianist. Then as now I wanted to express music through conducting, because the repertoire that meant the most to me also included the orchestral and the operatic.&quot; An application from someone so young was highly unorthodox, in that it was widely assumed that you had to be a mature musician even to consider conducting. It was also risky in another way. If he hadn&apos;t been accepted he couldn&apos;t then change courses, &quot;and I would have been sent to the army. But as things turned out, I never had to shoot a gun.&quot; Despite being a star pupil, when Bychkov&apos;s critical views on the Soviet system were reported to the authorities he was obliged to apply for an exit visa, which resulted in him being ostracised within the conservatoire. &quot;I feel no bitterness towards some of the people there who condemned me,&quot; he says. &quot;They had no choice but to condemn, unless they wanted to find themselves in the same situation. But I had a very bitter sense of rejection of a system that claimed it was the most just and progressive society on the planet when it was not. It was one that made people lie and cheat and behave in a way they would not choose to do naturally. But it also inspired people to find a way to resist. This partly answers the question as to how a music like Shostakovich&apos;s was possible in a place that clamped down so heavily on free thought.&quot; After his emigration, Bychkov&apos;s father, a scientist, was denied his own exit visa. &quot;But things started to change 12 years later when Gorbachev came to power, and people gradually began to say what they felt. Soon afterwards I met my father at Vienna airport.&quot; Although his father was persecuted specifically because he was Jewish, Bychkov says he didn&apos;t have a religious upbringing and didn&apos;t even know the traditions of Judaism. &quot;My grandfather was observant, but because he was an old person he was untouched. For my parents&apos; generation, born soon after the revolution, it was a non-starter. So it was only when I came to America that I became aware of Jewish history and tradition, although I was always touched by belonging, as anyone should be. But am I observant now? No, I&apos;m not. Worse, I somehow always end up conducting on Yom Kippur. But when people point this out I say &apos;let&apos;s face it, I feel guilty enough throughout the year so I don&apos;t need a special day. I might as well make music.&apos;&quot; He says he never expected the new world to be perfect, but arriving in the US in 1975 &quot;was like being born for a second time. The fundamental things were pretty simple: freedom, opportunity and the ability to make your own decisions and then to take whatever consequences come as the result of your decisions.&quot; He enrolled at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, where he conducted the student orchestra. &quot;And that is the place that launched me. Even though it wasn&apos;t professional, I did Mahler and Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, and everything that happened in America came from that.&quot; His professional career began with orchestras in Grand Rapids and then Buffalo. &quot;And you begin to make decisions which, if they go well, move you from A to B to C, and if they go badly move you in more of a zigzag. But you learn that very few decisions are fatal. Planning that first season at Grand Rapids in 1980, I was like a kid in a toy store. The programme that opened my first season was Stauss&apos;s Zarathustra, intermission, Beethoven&apos;s ninth symphony. Some people were angry. They had never been to such a long concert in their lives, and they probably never will again.&quot; During the 80s he began to make guest debuts with the great American orchestras of Chicago, Boston and New York as well as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and, most notably, as a last-minute cover for Riccardo Muti with the Berlin Philharmonic. &quot;It was another return to my past. I had first encountered the Berlin phil in Leningrad in 1969. As students we couldn&apos;t afford tickets, but we always managed to get in. This time we made our way over the roof of the concert hall. It was summer, so all the windows were open, and I jumped through one. Unfortunately, it was the ladies&apos; room and the police were called. So in my first rehearsal I told the orchestra how nice it was to meet them all these years after they got me arrested.&quot; He says it took him a long time to learn how to run an orchestra. &quot;It is not meant to be easy all the time. Some decisions will be approved and some will be contested. The difficult thing is to extricate your ego from the decision. Your decision might be criticised, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that you are being criticised. Sometimes yes, but sometimes no. At the Buffalo Philharmonic we had a warmth of relationship from the beginning until the day I left. That simply never happened with the Orchestre de Paris. I stayed a long time [nine years] because I wanted to make it work. But it has proved to be one of life&apos;s lessons.&quot; Paris is now his principal home, where he lives with his second wife, the pianist Marielle Lab\u00e8que, one half of the Lab\u00e8que Sisters piano duo. &quot;I think it is a gift of my profession that you can get to know these countries from the inside. I feel at home in Paris, but also in America, St Petersburg, Germany, where I worked for many years, and now London.&quot; He says his attachments to the Royal Academy of Music and the BBC Symphony Orchestra have been particularly appealing because of the combination of youth and experience. &quot;As I grow older I am becoming more conscious of my obligation to share what I&apos;ve learnt with those who are coming after me. It is a natural process. When I look at the people now my age, who were once the younger generation, I see many extremely talented musicians who went on to become uninterested, bored, frustrated and unfulfilled. It is very sad. Today&apos;s youngsters have plenty of enthusiasm and idealism, and everything they play is, for them, the best thing ever. So my greatest responsibility is not to explain where they down bow, or where it goes slower \u2013 although of course that is part of it \u2013 but to show them that it is possible to go through your career without losing that enthusiasm to do anything to make the music convincing. When they look at me and they see that this dinosaur is still sweating and he has changed three shirts in three hours, they say that maybe they can do that too.&quot; In 2010 Bychkov gave up his last permanent post with an orchestra when he retired from the WDR Sinfonieorchester in Cologne. &quot;It was the first time I found myself without a permanent responsibility for an artistic institution since I was 17. I have always been a leader of something or other: a choir or a symphony orchestra or an opera house. So when I gave that up, even though my diary was full with things I wanted to do, there was a little trepidation. But the reality has been better than I ever thought it could be. As a leader, in some way, you influence the lives of the people in your organisation, and not always in ways that they find agreeable. Now that is gone I am received only for what I am able to give, which is music. So when I arrive for a concert or opera they have the best of me, and I have the best of them.&quot; Semyon Bychkov will conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Mahler and Berg at the Barbican, London on 25 November.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T22:55:06Z", "title": "Semyon Bychkov: beating time", "sentences": ["November&apos;s concerts have included performances in St Petersburg (where he was brought up and trained as a musician), Vienna (where he arrived in 1974 with $100 to his name as a Jewish exile from the Soviet Union), the US (where he made his home and established his musical reputation), Tel Aviv and London (where he has recently been awarded honorary positions with both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Academy of Music)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/16/semyon-bychkov-beating-time"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Hamas", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israeli air strikes have hit the office building of the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, amid warnings of a dangerous escalation in the conflict with up to 75,000 Israeli reservists mobilised for a possible ground invasion. An explosion and air raid sirens were heard over the Israeli port city of Tel Aviv as Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to fire rocket salvoes across the border four days after Israel launched an air offensive. Israel said it had struck more than 800 targets in the Gaza Strip, with 200 air strikes over Friday night and Saturday morning. Gaza officials said about 500 rockets had been launched so far at Israel, according to Associated Press. Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, said an Israeli air strike had wrecked the office building of its prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, a day after a visit from Egypt&apos;s prime minister. The police headquarters in Gaza City was also hit, setting off a blaze that engulfed nearby houses and cars. A three-storey house belonging to the Hamas official Abu Hassan Salah was destroyed early on Saturday, with at least 30 people rescued from the rubble, Reuters reported. The US is scrambling to prevent a further escalation of what it described as a &quot;very, very dangerous situation&quot; in Gaza, and Britain has warned Israel it risks losing international support. The size of the reservists callup is on a scale comparable to Israel&apos;s invasion of Lebanon six years ago, and several times larger than the number drafted during the last major incursion into Gaza, in 2008. Tanks have been seen gathering near the Gaza border, and roads in the area have been closed to Israeli civilians. Israel&apos;s deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, told CNN that a ground invasion could come before the end of the weekend if the rocket attacks continued. &quot;We don&apos;t want to get into Gaza if we don&apos;t have to. But if they keep firing at us \u2026 a ground operation is still on the cards,&quot; he said. &quot;If we see in the next 24 to 36 hours more rockets launched at us, I think that would be the trigger.&quot; A rocket attack on Tel Aviv on Saturday, the third since hostilities began on Wednesday, was intercepted by Israeli missiles. Police said there were no casualties. In southern Gaza, Israeli aircraft went after the hundreds of underground tunnels used to smuggle in weapons, fuel and food from Egypt, people in the area reported. Six people, including five militants, were killed and dozens wounded in the various attacks on Saturday, said Ashraf al-Kidra, a Gaza health official. Up to 41 Palestinians including 13 civilians, and three Israeli civilians have been killed since the Israeli operation began, AP reported. Palestinians said their dead included at least eight children and a pregnant woman. Tunisia&apos;s foreign minister, Rafik Abdesslem, arrived in Gaza on Saturday to show solidarity and denounce the Israeli attacks. &quot;What Israel is doing is not legitimate and is not acceptable at all,&quot; he said. &quot;It does not have total immunity and is not above international law.&quot; On Friday the White House said Barack Obama had spoken to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, about de-escalating the violence while reiterating his support for Israel&apos;s right to defend itself. The US president also spoke to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister of Turkey, in the hope he could influence Hamas. Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, told the BBC that a ground invasion could cost Israel international support. &quot;Israel does have to bear in mind that it is when ground invasions have taken place in previous conflicts that they have lost international support and a great deal of sympathy around the world.&quot; Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, called for a personal intervention by Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. He said a &quot;full-scale diplomatic initiative&quot; by Ban over the next few days might be the only way to halt the violence. &quot;The only hope for peace and security for the citizens of the region will be through re-starting the stalled negotiations towards agreeing a two-state solution,&quot; he said. But attitudes appeared to be hardening in Egypt, where Morsi denounced Israel&apos;s attacks on the Gaza Strip as &quot;a blatant aggression against humanity&quot; and said Cairo &quot;would not leave Gaza on its own&quot;. In a statement that will increase western concern about strengthening anti-Israel sentiment in post-revolutionary Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East, Morsi added: &quot;Egypt today is not the Egypt of yesterday, and Arabs today are not the Arabs of yesterday.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T16:28:44Z", "title": "Israeli air strike hits Hamas PM's office", "sentences": ["An explosion and air raid sirens were heard over the Israeli port city of Tel Aviv as Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to fire rocket salvoes across the border four days after Israel launched an air offensive.", "&quot;If we see in the next 24 to 36 hours more rockets launched at us, I think that would be the trigger.&quot; A rocket attack on Tel Aviv on Saturday, the third since hostilities began on Wednesday, was intercepted by Israeli missiles."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/17/israeli-air-strike-hamas-pm-office"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Barack Obama", "Middle East peace talks", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "President Barack Obama has personally urged leaders in Turkey and Egypt to engage with Hamas over a &quot;de-escalation&quot; of hostilities in Gaza, while continuing to support Israeli strikes despite mounting Palestinian civilian casualties. Speaking on board Air Force One en route to Asia, White House national security adviser Ben Rhodes blamed Hamas for the current round of violence, stating that the &quot;precipitating factor&quot; for Israeli air strikes were rockets fired into civilian territories from Gaza. It comes as the Palestinian death toll continues to rise. Up to 41 Gazans, including 13 civilians, and three Israelis have been killed since the Israeli operation began. Palestinian authorities have said their dead included at least eight children and a pregnant woman. Asked about the bombing of government buildings \u2013 including prime minister Ismail Haniyeh&apos;s offices \u2013 the US official said he wouldn&apos;t comment on &quot;specific targeting choices&quot; other than to say that the administration would &quot;always underscore the importance of avoiding civilian casualties&quot;. But Rhodes reiterated the White House view that Hamas was responsible for the latest outburst of violence. &quot;Just to be clear on the precipitating factor: these rockets had been fired into Israeli civilian areas and territory for some time now. So Israelis have endured far too much of a threat from these rocket for far too long, and that is what led the Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza,&quot; he said. He added that the US wanted the same thing as Israelis: &quot;an end to the rocket fire coming out of Gaza&quot;. The comments come as the White House increased its diplomatic efforts to end the violence in Gaza. Obama has spoken to Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it emerged on Saturday, along with Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi. Both men have the &quot;ability to play a constructive role in engaging Hamas and encouraging a process of de-escalation&quot;, Rhodes said. However, on Saturday, Erdogan appeared to take a different side in the conflict, despite the call from Obama. The Turkish leader on Saturday vowed support for Gaza&apos;s Palestinians in a speech at Cairo University in Egypt. He also met Morsi for the first time since the Eggyptian Islamist leader was elected in late June, with Erdogan saying that that win at the polls offered hope to Palestinians. The US has been reaching out to leaders across the Middle East as Israel and Hamas trade volleys of fire. Secretary of state Hillary Clinton has spoken to the foreign ministers if Israel, Turkey and Egypt in the past few days, as well as Jordan&apos;s King Abdullah. But the US has been clear in pledging its support for Israel, its staunch ally. Obama, who was on Saturday making his way to south-east Asia for a three day trip, has spoken to prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu every day since the current round of Israeli air strikes in Gaza commenced. At a briefing on Friday, a State Department spokeswoman summed up the US position: &quot;We are urging a de-escalation of this conflict. We are urging those countries with influence on Hamas and other groups in Gaza to use that influence to get a de-escalation,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;We support \u2026 Israel&apos;s right to self-defence, and we obviously express our regret and sadness for the loss of life on all sides.&quot; Israel has seen the US stance as a clear signal that it has a virtually free hand. On Friday, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Michael Oren, said during a visit to Capitol Hill: &quot;The United States has given us the full backing to take whatever measures are necessary to defend our citizens from Hamas terror.&quot; Meanwhile, the Palestinian delegation to Washington has condemned the US response to the crisis as &quot;biased and weak&quot;. Despite diplomatic efforts, the violence continued on Saturday. Israeli air strikes hit the office building of the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, amid warnings of a dangerous escalation in the conflict with up to 75,000 Israeli reservists mobilised for a possible ground invasion. An explosion and air raid sirens were also heard over the Israeli port city of Tel Aviv as Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to fire rocket salvoes across the border four days after Israel launched an air offensive. So far Israel has struck more than 800 targets in Gaza while Gaza officials there said about 500 rockets had been launched so far at Israel.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T18:29:16Z", "title": "Obama urges Egypt and Turkey to play key Gaza role as death toll mounts", "sentences": ["An explosion and air raid sirens were also heard over the Israeli port city of Tel Aviv as Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to fire rocket salvoes across the border four days after Israel launched an air offensive."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/17/obama-egypt-turkey-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Hamas", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "On an eerily deserted street in the al-Karama district of Gaza City, the Abu Sinan family was waiting \u2013 in vain \u2013 for a taxi. Clutching two blue plastic bags full of clothing and a black backpack, 19-year-old Tariq alternated between scanning the road for a vehicle and casting his eyes to the sky, from where the buzz of Israeli drones could be heard. Their intended destination was just a few miles across town. &quot;We think it&apos;s a safer area,&quot; he said. &quot;Here, there is a lot of empty ground. We see the resistance firing rockets every day, so there are a lot of air strikes.&quot; He had no idea how long the family would be away from their home: &quot;Until it&apos;s over.&quot; A growing number of desperate Gazans appeared to be on the move. One man said that he had taken his wife and baby to Khan Younis, a city in the southern half of the Gaza Strip, in the hope that it was safer. A woman who took her family to spend the night in a community centre said she had found no respite from the bombing: &quot;We discovered everywhere is equal on the safety scale.&quot; People are beginning to feel like rats in a cage as Israel pummels the tiny territory with missiles and steps up preparations for a possible ground invasion. The Israeli Defence Forces struck 200 targets overnight; tanks and troops are massing on Gaza&apos;s borders; up to 75,000 reservists are being called up. The immediate area around Gaza has been declared a closed military zone. The psychological impact on Gaza&apos;s population of the current offensive is as much a weapon of war as the bombing itself. People in Gaza City say their children are terrified and unable to sleep. Explosions rock the ground and rattle windows throughout the night; daylight brings little respite from the barrage of missiles unleashed on the 1.5 million people crowded into the enclave. Gaza has no public bomb shelters and there is no air raid warning system. Schools, universities, government offices and most shops have closed. Few people venture far from their homes on foot, and traffic is scarce. The IDF have dropped leaflets over several population areas, warning people to stay away from &quot;the vicinity of Hamas operatives and facilities and those of other terror organisations&quot; for their own safety. There are reports that text messages bearing a similar message have been sent to mobile phones. But, despite the rising sense of alarm and anticipation at what the coming days might bring, some say efforts to find a safe haven are futile. Ahmed Hatoum, 60, who lives next door to the Hamas headquarters flattened by a powerful air strike at 5am on Saturday, shrugged at the idea of moving his family: &quot;I have no place to go. I&apos;d leave if I could, but in Gaza there is no place to hide.&quot; The danger is not just from Israel. There are reports of militants&apos; rockets falling inside Gaza; the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said preliminary investigations suggested a missile that killed a four-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man in Jabaliya on Friday may have been fired from within the Gaza Strip. The stakes are rising. Rockets have reached close to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israel&apos;s two major cities, in the last couple of days as Hamas and other militant groups have begun to deploy long-range weapons from their stockpiled arsenals. &quot;Hamas seems to be going all the way to the brink,&quot; said Mkhaimer Abusader, a political scientist at Gaza&apos;s Azhar University. &quot;For the past four years, Hamas has been preparing itself for this day.&quot; The organisation has built bunkers, improved its military technology and acquired more sophisticated and powerful weapons, principally from Libya. But Israel would not tolerate the launching of rockets at its major population centres, a move which made a ground invasion more likely, he said. However, sending in troops and tanks also carries risks for Israel. If the goal is to topple Hamas, even more extremist resistance groups could fill the resulting power vacuum. To prevent that, Israel may have to contemplate a long-term reoccupation of Gaza, a step it is reluctant to take. A third scenario \u2013 damaging Hamas&apos;s infrastructure, deterring its capacity to launch rockets, but leaving the regime in place \u2013 would take both sides back to the situation at the end of the last war almost four years ago. There is also the risk that Israel&apos;s actions will result only in support for Hamas hardening. In Jabaliya, north of Gaza City, young boys clambered over a small mountain of masonry chunks, twisted metal and broken glass which, until 6am on Saturday, had been the home of a Hamas official. At the sound of a rocket being fired nearby, the children whooped and cheered. Nearby, Sharif Khalah, 26, a neighbour of the child and man killed on Friday by a missile that could have been home-grown, said rocket fire from the area was continual. &quot;I support it,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to defend ourselves against the enemy. We can&apos;t do nothing when they attack us.&quot; Abusader said Gazans were divided. &quot;Those who support Hamas feel very happy that missiles are landing in Tel Aviv. But others are sick and tired, they are exhausted. They are saying they have never recovered from [the last war] and all they want is to live a normal life. It&apos;s hard to tell who is in the majority.&quot; In southern Israel, people are also living in fear, jumping at the sound of air raid warnings which give them just a few seconds to reach a bomb shelter or safe room. Ten people were injured when rockets hit an apartment building and three houses in Ashdod, a city north of Gaza, on Saturday. Two explosions were reportedly heard in Tel Aviv; on Thursday, three Israelis were killed by a missile apparently fired from Gaza. Abusader said he feared the violence was set to continue for some time yet, despite appeals from the international community. &quot;The hard fact is that there is no military solution to the Gaza problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Israel could kill all the Hamas leadership, but that&apos;s not going to put an end to the Palestinian struggle. There has to be a political solution to this. Without that, this conflict is going to go on and on.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T19:21:52Z", "title": "Gazans in frantic hunt for safety as Israeli forces remain on alert", "sentences": ["Rockets have reached close to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israel&apos;s two major cities, in the last couple of days as Hamas and other militant groups have begun to deploy long-range weapons from their stockpiled arsenals.", "&quot;Those who support Hamas feel very happy that missiles are landing in Tel Aviv.", "Two explosions were reportedly heard in Tel Aviv; on Thursday, three Israelis were killed by a missile apparently fired from Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/18/gaza-frantic-hunt-safety-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The deployment of troops to Israel&apos;s border with Gaza has been met with a resigned air by political commentators and the public alike.

As the Israeli military began the emergency call-up of up to 75,000 reservists, leaders from Turkey, Egypt and Qatar met in Cairo to discuss ways of ending the escalating violence. Since Wednesday Israel has launched about 1,000 air strikes on the coastal Palestinian territory.  The raids have continued past midnight into Sunday. Two pre-dawn attacks on houses in the Jabiliya refugee camp killed two children and wounded 13 other people, Gaza medical officials said. Witnesses said a building in Gaza City housing the offices of Hamas&apos;s al-Aqsa TV was bombed, wounding six journalists. The building was also used by Arabic and international news outlets including Germany&apos;s ARD, Kuwait TV, the Italian RAI, Sky News of Britain and others. The Israeli military also appeared to take over the frequencies of the radio stations of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group to broadcast a recorded, Arabic-language warning to the people of Gaza to stay away from Hamas installations and personnel. &quot;To the people of Gaza, Hamas is playing with fire and gambling with your fate. The Israel defence force is moving toward the second phase of its operation. For your safety you should stay away from Hamas infrastructure and personnel.&quot; The message did not say what the &quot;second phase&quot; was but thousands of Israeli troops are massed near the Gaza border awaiting an order to invade. Overnight, aircraft targeted dozens of underground rocket launchers and a major Hamas training base and command centre, the Israeli military said. It said it also attacked a communications antenna and gunboats fired on militant sites on the Gaza shoreline. In all 48 Palestinians, about half of them civilians, have been killed and more than 400 civilians wounded, according to Gaza medical officials. The World Health Organisation said Gaza hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties and their medical supplies were running short. Three Israeli civilians have been killed and more than 50 wounded. The US urged diplomacy and &quot;de-escalation&quot; but said Israel had the right to self-defence. It wanted the &quot;same thing as the Israelis want&quot; in ending rocket attacks, the White House said in a statement. In Tel Aviv air raid sirens sounded for the third day running, with residents reporting the sound of an explosion. Hamas said it had fired a Fajr-5 rocket from its arsenal of long-range missiles. Three Israelis have been killed since the conflict began on Wednesday. A small mountain of rubble, twisted metal and broken glass was all that remained of Haniyeh&apos;s headquarters. Several Palestinian flags fluttered on poles poking out from the debris. Strikes from Israeli aircraft and warships continued to pummel the Gaza Strip throughout Saturday. Israel&apos;s hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, warned of a &quot;crushing response&quot; still to come to prevent missile fire by Hamas and other militant groups but denied that Israel had launched an all-out war. &quot;The only way we can achieve peace and security is to create real deterrence via a crushing response that will make sure they don&apos;t try to test us again,&quot; he said. &quot;This isn&apos;t an all-out war but an operation with defined goals.&quot; If a ground invasion were authorised Israel would have to &quot;see it through,&quot; he said. &quot;This wasn&apos;t done during Operation Cast Lead [the 22-day war four years ago], which is why we failed to achieve our goal.&quot; On a visit to Gaza the Tunisian foreign minister, Rafik Abdesslem, denounced the Israeli attacks as unacceptable and against international law. &quot;Israel should understand that many things have changed and that lots of water has run in the Arab river,&quot; he said. &quot;It should realise it no longer has a free hand. It does not have total immunity and is not above international law \u2026 What Israel is doing is not legitimate and is not acceptable at all.&quot; He was expected to later join a meeting in Cairo of regional leaders, along with Hamas&apos;s Khaled Mashaal and Ramadan Shallah, the Islamic Jihad secretary general, to discuss ways of trying to contain the crisis. Others at the gathering included Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, Turkey&apos;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the Qatari emir. The meeting came as Arab League foreign ministers also met to draw up a draft statement calling for a negotiated ceasefire. The league was further expected to authorise its general secretary, Nabil Elaraby, to lead a delegation into Gaza following visits in recent days. Erdogan has been a highly outspoken critic of Israel, while Qatar&apos;s emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, visited Gaza in October, breaking the isolation of the Hamas government. Arab League diplomats briefed on Saturday evening that its statement would be calling for an immediate ceasefire. However Hamas officials in Gaza said that any truce would be dependent on Israel agreeing to lift its long-term blockade of the territory and agree to end its policy of assassinations of Hamas leaders, conditions that Israel is unlikely to accept. The disclosure of the terms of the talks began to emerge as Hamas fired a Fajr-5 missile at the outskirts of Tel Aviv, which is likely to reinforce Israel&apos;s willingness to push ahead with the campaign after a day of continuing rocket fire out of Gaza and Israeli air strikes. According to military sources, Egyptian intelligence officials met Hamas officials in Gaza for the second day running. The talks coincided with recent high-profile delegations that have entered Gaza to show solidarity with Palestinians living there. Tunisian foreign minister Rafik Abdesslem visited Gaza a day after Egyptian prime minister Hisham Kandil crossed the border into the Palestinian enclave, condemning Israeli actions and pledging to work for a truce. Meshaal also held talks on Saturday with Egyptian security officials on prospects for a truce. Egypt brokered an informal truce in October, which has since collapsed. It now says it is seeking a new deal. An Arab diplomatic source, who declined to be named, told Reuters the Arab League draft to be discussed by the ministers expressed the Cairo-based league&apos;s support for Egypt&apos;s efforts to achieve a &quot;long-term truce&quot; between Israel and Palestinian factions. The draft also calls for the UN security council to take the necessary steps to halt the violence and &quot;protect the Palestinian people&quot;.

A strike in Gaza City on Sunday flattened the home of a family known for its support for Hamas, killing three women and a fourth civilian, according to Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra. Another strike in the city brought down a home near a Hamas police station. Rescue workers pulled out the body of a dead woman, along with several surviving members of her family. In the Shati refugee camp, a missile struck the car of a Hamas militant outside his home, killing him and an 11-year-old girl passing by at the time, al-Kidra said.

However, Hamas officials in Gaza said any truce would be dependent on Israel agreeing to lift its long-term blockade of the territory and agree to end its policy of assassinations of Hamas leaders, conditions that Israel is unlikely to accept. Egypt brokered an informal truce in October, which has since collapsed. An Arab diplomatic source, who declined to be named, told Reuters the Arab League draft to be discussed by the ministers expresses the Cairo-based league&apos;s support for Egypt&apos;s efforts to achieve a &quot;long-term truce&quot; between Israel and Palestinian factions. The draft also calls for the UN security council to take the necessary steps to halt the violence and &quot;protect the Palestinian people&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T14:54:00Z", "title": "Israel ready to expand Gaza offensive, says Binyamin Netanyahu", "sentences": ["Netanyahu told the Israeli cabinet in remarks broadcast on Sunday: &quot;We are exacting a heavy price from Hamas and the terrorist organisations and the Israel Defence Forces are prepared for a significant expansion of the operation.&quot; There appeared to be a lull in rocket fire out of Gaza overnight, but air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Ashdod on Sunday morning.", "Israel&apos;s Channel 2 reported that rocket fire aimed at Tel Aviv was intercepted by an Iron Dome defence battery."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/18/israel-ready-expand-gaza-offensive"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Egypt", "Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "An Israeli envoy has arrived in Egypt for possible negotiations on a ceasefire as the barrage on Gaza intensified and the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, threatened to &quot;significantly expand&quot; military operations. Amid signs of Israeli preparations for an invasion, the US and UK signalled that although they accepted that strikes against Gaza had been justified because of rockets fired by militants inside the Palestinian enclave, their support would lessen if Israel sent in troops and tanks. &quot;Israel has every right to expect that it does not have missiles fired into its territory,&quot; Barack Obama said at the start of a three-nation tour in Asia. &quot;Let&apos;s understand what the precipitating event here was \u2026 that was an ever escalating number of missiles that were landing not just in Israeli territory but in areas that are populated. &quot;There is no country on earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders.&quot; The US president said it would be preferable if the Israeli operation against rocket launchers in Gaza could be accomplished without &quot;a ramping-up of military activity&quot;. Obama added: &quot;It&apos;s not just preferable for the people of Gaza. It&apos;s also preferable for Israelis, because if Israeli troops are in Gaza, they&apos;re much more at risk of incurring fatalities or being wounded.&quot; Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, told Sky News that the ruling Hamas party bore &quot;principal responsibility&quot; for the current conflict, but added that a ground invasion would &quot;lose Israel a lot of the international support and sympathy they have in this situation&quot;. A senior Israeli official in Jerusalem confirmed to the Haaretz newspaper that an envoy had been dispatched to Cairo for ceasefire talks. The envoy was not named and the official said Israel did not expect a breakthrough and preparations for a possible ground offensive were continuing. Reports from Cairo said the unnamed envoy had been taken straight from the airport to secret talks with Egyptian officials. Nabil Shaath, an aide to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who was also in Cairo, described the contacts between Israel and Egypt as &quot;serious attempts to reach a ceasefire&quot;. The Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, was reported to have spoken to the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, and told him he supports such talks, provided Hamas received &quot;guarantees that will prevent any future aggression&quot; by Israel, according to a statement issued from Haniyeh&apos;s office. Netanyahu was reported to have told Obama and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Israel might agree to a ceasefire if all rocket fire ceased from Palestinian territory. In southern Israel, contingents of reservists who had been called up in anticipation of a possible ground operation in Gaza arrived near the border on Sunday, and military vehicles trundled along nearby roads, some of which have been closed to civilian traffic. Hamas&apos;s repeated targeting of Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s densely populated cultural and commercial centre, raised expectations that Netanyahu would respond to pressure to step up action to halt rocket fire from Gaza. However, both sides are thought to be keen to avoid such an escalation. &quot;No matter what Hamas&apos;s capabilities are, they will not be able to defend Gaza from Israel [in the event of a ground offensive],&quot; said Mkhaimer Abu Saada, a political scientist at Gaza&apos;s al-Azhar university. Israel, despite its hawkish rhetoric, is also aware that the high casualties that are inevitable in a ground offensive are likely to result in a sharp change of tone from the international community. Abu Saada said there were two likely scenarios: a limited ground operation with Israeli troops and tanks entering and occupying relatively small areas of Gaza and withdrawing as soon as possible, as happened in Operation Cast Lead, the 22-day offensive in 2008-9; or a much bigger operation to &quot;hit Hamas hard, weakening it to the point where it was no longer capable of ruling Gaza&quot;. However, to prevent even more extremist militant organisations filling the resulting power vacuum, Israel would have to reoccupy Gaza on a long-term basis. &quot;This is probably the last thing in Israel&apos;s mind,&quot; he said. &quot;Netanyahu is in a dilemma now,&quot; Abu Saada said. Now that he has started the war, it is not clear how to end it in a way that would meet Israel&apos;s goal of restoring deterrence and punishing Hamas without becoming embroiled in a full-scale military occupation. The Israel Defence Force said it attacked 50 targets on Sunday, including Hamas rocket launchers. The BBC reported that seven Hamas officials&apos; homes had also been hit. The IDF said 900 rockets had been fired from Palestinian territory into Israel over the five days of fighting, of which 302 had been hit by Israeli interceptors fired by Israel&apos;s Iron Dome anti-missile system. Eight Israelis were reported wounded in rocket strikes on Sunday. According to Israeli officials, more than 100 rockets fired from Gaza have fallen within the Palestinian enclave, some causing injuries and deaths. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said an investigation suggested the deaths of a four-year-old child and a 22-year-old man in Jabaliya, north of Gaza City, on Friday had been caused by a rocket that had fallen short of its target.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T19:35:11Z", "title": "Israeli envoy arrives in Egypt for Gaza ceasefire talks", "sentences": ["Hamas&apos;s repeated targeting of Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s densely populated cultural and commercial centre, raised expectations that Netanyahu would respond to pressure to step up action to halt rocket fire from Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/18/israeli-envoy-egypt-gaza-talks"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Hamas", "World news", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "     At least 11 members of one family, including five women and four children, were killed when Israel bombed a house in Gaza City on Sunday as the five-day-old war claimed more civilian lives with no sign of a let-up in the intense bombardment. The air strike flattened the home of the Dalou family in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, causing the biggest death toll in a single incident since the offensive began last Wednesday. On Monday morning the Israeli defence force appeared to admit the family had been killed by mistake. The Haaretz website quoted the army as saying their house was either incorrectly pinpointed or a missile malfunctioned.  Elsewhere in the city early Monday an air strike levelled two houses belonging to a single family, killing two children and two adults and injuring 42 people, including children, said Gaza heath official Ashraf al-Kidra. Rescue workers were frantically searching for 12 to 15 members of the Azzam family under the rubble. Shortly afterwards, Israeli aircraft bombarded the remains of the former national security compound in Gaza City. Al-Kidra said flying shrapnel killed one child and wounded others living nearby. After the Dalou family home was destroyed, the bodies of the children were pulled from the rubble and taken to the morgue at Shifa hospital. The dead also included an 80-year-old woman. Ismael Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, described the deaths as an &quot;ugly massacre&quot; and the Hamas military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, said: &quot;The massacre of the Dalou family will not pass without punishment.&quot; Diggers at the scene of the explosion were scooping rubble from flattened buildings as rescuers tried to locate survivors. Witnesses said there were chaotic scenes as the dead and injured were brought to the Shifa hospital, which has been on emergency footing since the start of Operation Pillar of Defence. The bodies of four young children lay on two metal trays in the morgue, covered in dust and blood. A crowd of onlookers outside became increasingly distressed as the body of the children&apos;s mother was wheeled in, covered in blankets. The strike was originally thought to have been aimed at a Hamas official, Mohamed Dalou. In all, 84 Palestinians, about half of them civilians, have been killed in the five-day onslaught and 720 have been wounded. Three Israeli civilians have died from Palestinian rocket fire and dozens have been wounded. After an overnight lull in rocket fire from Gaza, Hamas and other groups renewed their attacks on Sunday. Sirens were activated in Tel Aviv for the third day running. Israel Army Radio reported that two rockets fired at the city were shot down by Iron Dome defence system. Late night, there were reports of renewed shelling in Gaza by Israeli navel vessels. The tactic of targeting militants&apos; homes carries the risk of further high casualties in the densely populated areas of Gaza&apos;s main cities. Many militants have moved their families to safer areas before going into hiding themselves. The Israeli military has also expanded the scope of its targets to take in Hamas-run government offices and compounds. Some families living near militants or government buildings are leaving their homes to move in with relatives in signs of increasing internal displacement within the small and crowded Gaza Strip. Israel claims it is carrying out &quot;surgical strikes&quot; and making strenuous efforts to avoid civilian casualties. &quot;It is our intention to avoid what is called collateral damage,&quot; Moshe Yaalon, minister for strategic affairs, told a press conference in Jerusalem. &quot;We operate slowly, identify the target and clean the area around it,&quot; he added, referring to warnings issued via dropped leaflets and text messages to civilians to stay away from individuals and locations likely to be targeted. &quot;But when they use civilians as human shields, what is our choice?&quot; he said. &quot;If they position rockets in densely populated areas, such as mosques and schoolyards, we should not be blamed for the outcome.&quot; The World Health Organisation warned that Gaza&apos;s medical facilities were being overwhelmed as the number of people injured in air strikes topped 400, about one-third of whom are children. &quot;Many of those injured have been admitted to hospitals with severe burns, injuries from collapsing buildings and head injuries,&quot; the WHO said in a statement issued in Geneva. The UN body appealed for $10m (\u00a36.3m) in immediate international support to help them cope with the casualties. Sunday&apos;s death toll came after a night of heavy bombardment, including repeated and intensive fire from gunboats stationed off the Gaza coast. Two buildings housing media organisations were struck in the early hours, injuring eight Palestinian journalists including a cameraman who lost a leg. The al-Shawa building, which includes the studios of al-Quds television, which is associated with Islamic Jihad, and the al-Shuruq building, housing Sky News, al-Arabiya news network, Dubai TV and an office of al-Aqsa TV, which is affiliated with Hamas, were hit. In a statement, the Israeli Defence Forces said: &quot;A communications antenna used by Hamas to carry out terror activity against the state of Israel, was ... targeted.&quot; The IDF denied that journalists were targeted.

For the second night, there was a lull in rocket fire out of Gaza, with only one missile launched, according to the IDF. It claimed the capabilities of Hamas and other militant groups have been significantly reduced by bombing. Rocket fire resumed on Monday morning. Palestinian official Nabil Shaath said some progress had been made at ceasefire talks in Cairo, but a truce was not imminent. It was &quot;not likely to take effect in the coming days because Israel is trying to impose its own stipulations ignoring the demands of Hamas and other Palestinian factions,&quot; Shaath told the Palestinian news agency Ma&apos;an after being briefed by the Hamas leader, Khaled Meshal, and his deputy, Mousa Abu Marzouq, who are in Cairo. Israel has also sent an envoy to the Egyptian capital. Reports from Cairo said the unnamed envoy had been taken straight from the airport to secret talks with Egyptian officials. Shaath described the contacts between Israel and Egypt as &quot;serious attempts to reach a ceasefire&quot; but a senior Israeli official in Jerusalem told the Haaretz newspaper that Israel did not expect a breakthrough. The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, is due to arrive in the region on Tuesday to shore up efforts to reach a ceasefire. He is to visit Jerusalem, Ramallah and Cairo. Unconfirmed reports suggest Hamas is seeking an end to targeted assassinations of militants in Gaza by the Israeli military and for the blockade of Gaza to be lifted. Israel is seeking a long-term truce of at least 15 years, an end to rocket fire, attacks on Israeli soldiers along the border and weapons smuggling. It is also insisting on continuing targeted killings if it believes an attack is imminent, according to a report on the Israeli Ynet website. As the death toll in Gaza reached at least 88 overnight, shocking pictures of four children killed in an airstrike on Sunday were broadcast repeatedly on Arab television. The images are likely to harden support for Hamas against what Palestinians see as Israeli &quot;aggression&quot;. Without a ceasefire in the coming days, the prospects of a ground invasion will rise. According to an opinion poll in Haaretz, 30% of Israelis support an escalation despite the risks of high casualties. Operation Pillar of Defence has the support of around 84% of the public, with 12% opposing the offensive. Personal opinion ratings for the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the defence minister, Ehud Barak, have risen since the conflict began.

It is Israel&apos;s fifth Iron Dome battery, whose deployment was accelerated at the weekend to position it in the south of the city to shoot down long-range rockets from Gaza. It has had considerable success. Two rockets aimed at Tel Aviv on Sunday were shot down by Iron Dome, and on Monday about 19 missiles were intercepted, bringing the total since the war began to more than 300. But that is less than a third of the 1,000-plus rockets fired from Gaza since the start of Operation Pillar of Defence. And it was disclosed on Monday that three Israelis killed in a rocket attack in Kiryat Malachi \u2013 the only Israeli casualties so far in the war \u2013 died after Iron Dome malfunctioned. A school in the southern city of Ashkelon was damaged when a rocket exploded in its car park on Monday. &quot;No children are at school today and therefore no one was injured at the scene,&quot; said an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld. Police reinforcements had been sent to the south, he added. Air raid sirens sounded over southern cities throughout the day, giving people 15 seconds to find shelter. The anti-missile system was first deployed in April 2011, after more than three years in development. Much of its funding came from the United States. The five batteries \u2013 each with three missile launchers and a heavily computerised mobile control unit \u2013 are currently all operating in southern Israel, with the capability of intercepting rockets from distances of up to 50 miles. On Sunday the defence minister, Ehud Barak, described Iron Dome&apos;s achievements as &quot;unparalleled&quot;, but added: &quot;We need 13 batteries to cover the entire area of the country from threats of short- and medium-range missiles.&quot; According to a senior official at Rafael Advanced Defence Systems, the Israeli defence company that developed Iron Dome, &quot;the problem is that there aren&apos;t enough of these things&quot;. The official, who declined to be named, said the system&apos;s successes were creating an additional problem in the minds of Israelis. &quot;People see [Iron Dome] as a saviour. We have warned that the danger is that people feel so secure with Iron Dome that they don&apos;t take security precautions when they hear sirens. [Instead] they film the rockets on their mobile phones.&quot; Rafael is developing a new anti-missile system, called David&apos;s Sling, which is designed to intercept long-range missiles fired from as far away as Iran. Two-thirds of its funding is coming from the US and the rest from Israel. It is expected to be operational by the end of 2013. Amos Harel, defence correspondent for Haaretz newspaper, said that in any future conflict Israel may be forced to choose between deploying its anti-missile systems to protect civilians or to protect its strategic assets and infrastructure. &quot;If the enemy is trying to hit air force bases, is the most important thing to protect attack capabilities or population bases?&quot; he said. Israeli generals, he said, acknowledged that defence systems were a &quot;short blanket&quot;, unable to cover everything.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T16:04:00Z", "title": "Israelis put faith in Iron Dome missile defence system", "sentences": ["There is a new attraction in Tel Aviv, drawing crowds of cheering supporters.", "Two rockets aimed at Tel Aviv on Sunday were shot down by Iron Dome, and on Monday about 19 missiles were intercepted, bringing the total since the war began to more than 300."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/19/iron-dome-israelis-faith-missile-defence"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "Egypt", "Africa", "Hamas", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "United Nations", "Tony Blair", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Egypt is the indispensable player in any attempt to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinans in the Gaza Strip. But it has good reasons of its own for wanting to help defuse an already bloody crisis which risks escalating into a wider and even more dangerous conflict. In that respect Mohammed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood president, is following a similar path to his overthrown predecessor Hosni Mubarak, though Morsi is far more sympathetic to Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Palestinian border enclave. Morsi&apos;s solidarity is not in question. But he has to consider Egypt&apos;s overall strategic and economic interests and is unlikely to want to jeopardise his country&apos;s 32-year-old peace treaty with Israel \u2014 and the US aid that goes with it. The extraordinary changes of the Arab spring have forced governments in the region to listen to their own people more than they did before. But the old constraints have not disappeared. Talks in Cairo between Egyptian General Intelligence and Israeli security officials are focusing on finding a mechanism to end the current fighting, while the Egyptians meet separately with Hamas. The trick, as with any negotiation, will be reaching an agreement that allows both parties to claim to their respective publics that they have achieved something tangible from the blood-letting. Hamas wants a guarantee from Israel that it would end &quot;targeted assassinations&quot; of the kind that killed Ahmed al-Jaabari last Wednesday. It would also need pledges about opening crossing points into Egypt and Israel \u2013 effectively lifting the five year blockade. Israel is insisting at a minimum on stopping the cross-border rocket fire which has united public opinion behind Operation Defensive Pillar. Israeli casualties have been low because the weapons are inaccurate and many of them were quickly destroyed. Any deal would include other understandings that are unlikely to be formulated explicitly or made public. Israel certainly wants the Egyptians to shut down the network of tunnels that are Gaza&apos;s lifeline to the outside world. Food and consumer goods are one thing, but the longer-range missiles that allow Hamas or more militant groups to strike targets in Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel&apos;s urban heartland are another. None of these demands for the endgame are particularly surprising: in the modern manner Hamas on Mondaylisted its demands on Facebook while an Israeli minister enumerated its own on Twitter. Hanging over the whole discussion is the much-advertised threat that Israel, having ordered a partial mobilisation of the reserves, will mount another large Cast Lead-type ground offensive inside Gaza, something which the US and other western countries have warned against. Israeli public opinion has its doubts as well \u2014 no small consideration for Binyamin Netanyahu with parliamentary elections due in January. It is safe to assume that neither Egypt nor Israel want to see the collapse of Hamas rule in Gaza. And Mohammed Abbas&apos;s PLO in the West Bank, discredited by the perception of many Palestinians that it has become complicit in Israel&apos;s policies, is in no position to take over. Yet even if a ceasefire is achieved \u2014 perhaps needing some kind of UN or other monitoring mechanism \u2014 it will take a far broader and more sustained effort, with wide international support, to revive the moribund peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It is the absence of any significant peace efforts for the last four years that have led to this latest brutal episode in the long and violent history of the conflict. Tony Blair&apos;s attempts in Ramallah, capital of the West Bank, to prevent Abbas seeking observer status at the UN are a reminder of how nit-pickingly marginal the international community has become. If there is no political perspective then it can only be a matter of time before the next round of hostilities erupts.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T17:54:00Z", "title": "Honest broker: Egypt's role on path to peace in Gaza", "sentences": ["Food and consumer goods are one thing, but the longer-range missiles that allow Hamas or more militant groups to strike targets in Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel&apos;s urban heartland are another."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/19/egypt-role-gaza-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Mahmoud Abbas", "Ban Ki-moon", "United Nations", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "William Hague", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "article": "Efforts to agree a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians are to intensify, with the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, weighing in amid guarded optimism that a deal is possible because it suits both sides to end the fighting. On a sixth day of Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip and sporadic though decreasing Palestinian rocket fire into Israel, negotiations in Cairo focused on securing a package that would allow both warring parties to claim some kind of victory. Barack Obama discussed the crisis in a phone call to the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, on Monday, while William Hague, Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, paid tribute to Egypt&apos;s efforts to negotiate &quot;a ceasefire that can work&quot;. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Obama and Morsi &quot;discussed ways to de-escalate the situation in Gaza&quot;, and Obama &quot;underscored the necessity&quot; of Hamas ending rocket fire into Israel. &quot;President Obama then called prime minister [Binyamin] Netanyahu of Israel, and received an update on the situation in Gaza and Israel,&quot; Carney added. &quot;In both calls, President Obama expressed regret for the loss of Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives, and agreed to stay in close touch with both leaders.&quot; Ban arrived in Cairo amid growing international concern that the crisis could escalate and spread. Israel is under pressure to refrain from sending ground forces into the heavily-populated coastal strip in the wake of its six-day air and naval assault. The UN secretary-general will visit Jerusalem for talks with Netanyahu on Tuesday, before heading to the West Bank town of Ramallah to see the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Khaled Meshal, the Hamas leader, told reporters in Cairo that Israel must be the first to halt military operations since it had begun them last week by assassinating the movement&apos;s military chief, Ahmed al-Jabari. &quot;A ground invasion will not be a walk in the park,&quot; Meshal warned. &quot;We don&apos;t have the same military and deterrence capabilities [as Israel] but we have deterred them with our will. Our enemy is drowning in the blood of children.&quot; Dan Harel, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army, said: &quot;We are moving straight into a T-junction. There are two basic alternatives. The first is an agreement cooked in Cairo. The second is an escalating situation, moving into the Gaza Strip with a land [invasion] which will be bad for both sides. We are 24 to 48 hours from this junction.&quot; Officials in Jerusalem flatly denied Meshal&apos;s claim that Israel was seeking a ceasefire. It was Hamas, one official said, that was looking for a way to &quot;climb down&quot; after more than 400 air strikes in Gaza had significantly eroded the Palestinians&apos; ability to launch missiles at Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities. &quot;Hamas&apos;s comments about a ceasefire, alleging that Israel is begging for one, are about as accurate as its claims to have shot down an F-15 [warplane] or attacked the Knesset,&quot; Reuters quoted a unnamed senior government official as saying. Israeli officials also emphasised their readiness to launch a ground offensive, although there were reports of complaints from Israeli army reservists that they were wasting their time. The US, Britain and other western governments have urged Israel not to mount an assault like Operation Cast Lead, in which 1400 Palestinians in Gaza were killed four years ago. Diplomats in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv were hopeful that a deal could yet be forged. &quot;The fact that the talks are still going on is a good sign,&quot; said one. &quot;And the fact that Israel hasn&apos;t yet gone in on the ground is a good sign.&quot; The Cairo truce talks ran into trouble on Sunday after news that 10 members of one family had been killed in Gaza in an air strike apparently aimed at killing a Hamas or Islamic Jihad leader. British officials monitoring the crisis said the key was to de-escalate, secure a durable ceasefire, and then return to the key questions of promoting reconciliation between Hamas and the PLO and re-invigorating a moribund peace process. Hague said in Brussels: &quot;I am pleased that Israel has held back from a ground invasion while such negotiations go on, and that the rate of rocket attacks on Israel has fallen, for whatever reason, over the last 24 hours. These are positive developments, but of course it remains a desperately serious and difficult situation.&quot; Palestinian sources said that Abbas had responded angrily on Monday to Tony Blair, the Middle East Quartet&apos;s envoy, in a meeting in Ramallah. Blair is trying to persuade Abbas to refrain from seeking observer status at the UN \u2013 a move opposed by the US and Israel. Abbas reportedly told him to leave if he was not there to talk about the crisis in Gaza. Israeli sources made clear that a ceasefire deal would have to mean an end to all hostile fire from Gaza into Israel, including small arms fire at troops near the border. Hamas fighters must also be stopped from crossing into Sinai to mount attacks against Israel from Egyptian territory. Hamas must not be allowed to rearm. Any ceasefire must not be a simple &quot;time out&quot; for Hamas but provide an extended period of quiet for southern Israel. Support for Operation Defensive Pillar remains solid in Israel. According to an opinion poll in Haaretz, 30% of the Israeli public support a ground invasion despite the risks of high casualties. Overall the operation has the backing of around 84% of the public, with 12% opposed. But in one sign of dissent, 100 writers, intellectuals and artists on Monday issued a petition calling for a long-term ceasefire, and more significantly for talks with Hamas, which has long been a political taboo. &quot;We must speak out because the people of southern Israel, like the people of Gaza, deserve to be able to look up at the sky in hope and not in fear, wrote the author Amos Oz, playwright Yehoshua Sobol and others.

By Tuesday, civilians accounted for 54 of the 113 Palestinians killed since the operation began. Some 840 people have been wounded, including 225 children, Gaza health officials said. Three Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire. Khaled Meshal, the Hamas leader, who was in Cairo for talks on Monday, told reporters Israel must be the first to halt military operations since it had begun them last week by assassinating the movement&apos;s military chief, Ahmed al-Jaabari. &quot;A ground invasion will not be a walk in the park,&quot; Meshal warned. &quot;We don&apos;t have the same military and deterrence capabilities [as Israel] but we have deterred them with our will. Our enemy is drowning in the blood of children.&quot; Officials in Jerusalem flatly denied Meshal&apos;s claim that Israel was seeking a ceasefire. It was Hamas, one official said, that was looking for a way to &quot;climb down&quot; after more than 400 air strikes in Gaza had significantly eroded the Palestinians&apos; ability to launch missiles at Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities. But diplomats in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv were hopeful a deal could be forged. &quot;The fact that the talks are still going on is a good sign,&quot; said one. &quot;And the fact that Israel hasn&apos;t yet gone in on the ground is a good sign.&quot; The Cairo truce talks ran into trouble on Sunday after news that 10 members of one family had been killed in Gaza in an air strike apparently aimed at killing a Hamas or Islamic Jihad leader. British officials monitoring the crisis said the key was to de-escalate, secure a durable ceasefire, and then return to the key questions of promoting reconciliation between Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and re-invigorating a moribund peace process. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said in Brussels: &quot;I am pleased that Israel has held back from a ground invasion while such negotiations go on, and that the rate of rocket attacks on Israel has fallen, for whatever reason, over the last 24 hours. These are positive developments, but of course it remains a desperately serious and difficult situation.&quot; Palestinian sources said that Abbas had responded angrily on Monday to Tony Blair, the Middle East Quartet&apos;s (the UN, US, EU and Russia) envoy, in a meeting in Ramallah. Blair is trying to persuade Abbas to refrain from seeking observer status at the UN \u2013 a move opposed by the US and Israel. Abbas reportedly told him to leave if he was not there to talk about the crisis in Gaza. Israeli sources made clear that a ceasefire deal would have to mean an end to all hostile fire from Gaza into Israel, including small arms fire at troops near the border. Hamas fighters must also be stopped from crossing into Sinai to mount attacks against Israel from Egyptian territory. Hamas must not be allowed to rearm. Any ceasefire must not be a simple &quot;time out&quot; for Hamas but provide an extended period of quiet for southern Israel. Support for Operation Defensive Pillar remains solid in Israel. According to an opinion poll in the Haaretz newspaper, 30% of the Israeli public support a ground invasion despite the risk of high casualties. Overall the operation has the backing of around 84% of the public, with 12% opposed. But in one sign of dissent, 100 writers, intellectuals and artists on Monday issued a petition calling for a long-term ceasefire, and more significantly for talks with Hamas, which has long been a political taboo. &quot;We must speak out because the people of southern Israel, like the people of Gaza, deserve to be able to look up at the sky in hope and not in fear,&quot; wrote the author Amos Oz, playwright Yehoshua Sobol and others.

As a group, they stand out for their technical skills and for the free, exhilarating range of their movement \u2013 a particular trademark of Naharin&apos;s choreography. Now this Tel Aviv-based company also need the nerve to dance through political protest. During their current UK tour, there have not only been anti-Israeli demonstrations outside the venues but inside the performance spaces proper. At Sadler&apos;s Wells on Monday, the audience were fiercely supportive of the dancers, countering every disruption with their own cheers and applause. Many were showing support for Naharin, a liberal Israeli who has criticised his government&apos;s policies towards Palestine and whose type will surely become essential if and when some conciliation is achieved within this harrowed\u00a0area. To the demonstrators outside, however, Batsheva were perceived only as a government-supported company and part of Israel&apos;s attempt to whitewash its international\u00a0image. In Britain, we rarely see art and politics colliding in this way, and it made for a moving, if troubling, night. The show, Deca Dance, is a collage of extracts from Naharin&apos;s choreography, set to an eclectic range of music, Arabic as well as western. For 90 minutes, we are treated to an exuberant kaleidoscope of colours, dynamics and forms: churning tribal ensembles alternating with slow, sculpted quartets; ripping, slashing, juddering movements that refine into small, polished images. Naharin&apos;s style is infectious. When members of the audience are coaxed on stage to dance, they comply with a remarkable lack of self-consciousness. It is highly effective, too, having nurtured a number of world-class choreographers, among them Hofesh Shechter. The issue for Israel, however, is that most of these alumni have opted not to remain in that country, but to live and work elsewhere. \u2022 What have you been to see lately?

Israel had every &quot;right to defend itself&quot;, Barack Obama declared. &quot;No country on earth would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders.&quot; He was echoed by Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, who declared that the Palestinian Islamists of Hamas bore &quot;principal responsibility&quot; for Israel&apos;s bombardment of the open-air prison that is the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, most western media have echoed Israel&apos;s claim that its assault is in retaliation for Hamas rocket attacks; the BBC speaks wearisomely of a conflict of &quot;ancient hatreds&quot;. In fact, an examination of the sequence of events over the last month shows that Israel played the decisive role in the military escalation: from its attack on a Khartoum arms factory reportedly supplying arms to Hamas and the killing of 15 Palestinian fighters in late October, to the shooting of a mentally disabled Palestinian in early November, the killing of a 13 year-old in an Israeli incursion and, crucially, the assassination of the Hamas commander Ahmed Jabari last Wednesday during negotiations over a temporary truce. Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, had plenty of motivation to unleash a new round of bloodletting. There was the imminence of Israeli elections (military attacks on the Palestinians are par for the course before Israeli polls); the need to test Egypt&apos;s new Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, and pressure Hamas to bring other Palestinian guerrilla groups to heel; and the chance to destroy missile caches before any confrontation with Iran, and test Israel&apos;s new Iron Dome anti-missile system. So after six days of sustained assault by the world&apos;s fourth largest military power on one of its most wretched and overcrowded territories, at least 130 Palestinians had been killed, an estimated half of them civilians, along with five Israelis. The goal, Israel&apos;s interior minister, Eli Yeshai, insisted, had been to &quot;send Gaza back to the middle ages&quot;. True, the bloodshed hasn&apos;t so far been on the scale of Operation Cast Lead in 2008-9, which left 1,400 Palestinians dead in three weeks. But the issue isn&apos;t just who started and escalated it, or even the grinding &quot;disproportionality&quot; of yet another Israeli military battering (even before last month&apos;s flareups, 314 Palestinians had been killed since 2009, as against 20 Israelis). It&apos;s that to portray Israel as some kind of victim with every right to &quot;defend itself&quot; from attack from &quot;outside its borders&quot; is a grotesque inversion of reality. Israel has after all been in illegal occupation of both the West Bank and Gaza, where most of the population are the families of refugees who were driven out of what is now Israel in 1948, for the\u00a0past 45 years. Despite Israel&apos;s withdrawal of settlements and bases in 2005, the Gaza Strip remains occupied, both effectively and legally \u2013 and is recognised as such by the UN. Israel is in control of Gaza&apos;s land and sea borders, territorial waters and natural resources, airspace, power supply and telecommunications. It has blockaded the strip since Hamas took over in 2006-7, preventing the movement of people, materials, and food supplies in and out of the territory \u2013 even calculating the 2,279 calories per person that would keep Gazans on an exemplary &quot;diet&quot;. And it continues to invade the strip at will. So Gazans are an occupied people and have the right to resist, including by armed force (though not to target civilians), while Israel is an occupying power that has an obligation to withdraw \u2013 not a right to defend territories it controls or is colonising by dint of military power. Even if Israel had genuinely ended its occupation in 2005, Gaza&apos;s people are Palestinians, and their territory part of the 22% of historic Palestine earmarked for a Palestinian state that depends on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem. Across their land, Palestinians have the right to defend and arm themselves, whether they choose to exercise it or not. But instead the US, Britain and other European powers finance, arm and back to the hilt Israel&apos;s occupation, including the siege of Gaza \u2013 precisely to prevent Palestinians obtaining the arms that would allow them to protect themselves against Israeli military might. It&apos;s hardly surprising of course that powers which have themselves invaded, occupied and intervened across the Arab and Muslim world over the last decade should throw their weight behind Israel doing the same thing on its own doorstep. But it isn&apos;t Palestinian rockets that stop Israel lifting the blockade, dismantling its illegal settlements or withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza \u2013 it&apos;s unconditional US and western support that gives Israel impunity. Whatever the Israeli government&apos;s mix of motivations for winding up the past week&apos;s conflict, it seems to have backfired. For the first time since the start of the Arab uprisings, the cause of Palestine is again centre stage. Emboldened by the wave of change and growing support across the region, Hamas has also regained credibility as a resistance force, which had faded since 2009, and strengthened its hand against an increasingly discredited Palestinian Authority leadership in Ramallah. The deployment of longer-range rockets that have now been shown to reach Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is also beginning to shift what has been an overwhelmingly one-sided balance of deterrence. The truce being negotiated on Tuesday would reportedly enforce Hamas responsibility for policing the strip and crucially break the blockade, opening the Rafah crossing with Egypt for goods as well as people. It doesn&apos;t, however, look like the long-term security deal with Hamas Israel was looking for, which would risk deepening the disastrous Palestinian split between Gaza and the West Bank. Any relief from the bombardment, death and suffering of the past week has got to be welcome. But no ceasefire is going to prevent another eruption of violence. Whatever is finally agreed won&apos;t end Israel&apos;s occupation and colonisation of Palestinian land or halt its war of dispossession against the Palestinian people. That demands unrelenting pressure on the western powers that underwrite it to change course. But most of all, it needs a change in the balance of forces on the ground. \u2022 Comments on this article will be opened on Wednesday morning", "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T22:32:00Z", "title": "It's Palestinians who have the right to defend themselves | Seumas Milne", "sentences": ["The deployment of longer-range rockets that have now been shown to reach Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is also beginning to shift what has been an overwhelmingly one-sided balance of deterrence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/20/palestinians-have-right-defend-themselves"}, {"tags": ["Middle East peace talks", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Hamas", "Gaza", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Israel"], "article": "It is in keeping with a conflict like the one we have witnessed for the past week in Gaza that the closer a ceasefire gets, the more intense the fighting becomes. As we write, it is impossible to say whether we are on the verge of quiet, truce, ceasefire, or however the word hudna is translated, or the start of a ground incursion by Israeli forces. Thousands of Gazans took shelter in UN-run schools as leaflets were dropped telling them to evacuate border areas. Shells then began landing in northern Gaza. Was this the last hurrah of the operation launched with the aim of degrading Hamas&apos;s military reach, or the start of an even bloodier and more prolonged phase? Hamas and the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, claimed earlier in the day that they had a deal. If so, this would not be the first time an armistice had been shot out of their hands. Killing is part of the talking. If you lose the argument, you die. No one but Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, knew whether he thought he had achieved enough from the operation to stop it. Its even more unclear what he would gain by continuing it. Before an overwhelmingly supportive Israeli public, the last week of assaults leaves him arguments he can make. He can say that while Gilad Shalit is back with his family, the man who kidnapped him, Hamas&apos;s military chief Ahmed al-Jaabari, is dead; he can say that the stock of missiles in Gaza is depleted and that the Iron Dome missile defence system proved itself. He can say the operation gave the lie to those who claimed Israel cannot act militarily now that the regional environment has been changed by the Arab spring. Further, he may well try to appropriate Egypt&apos;s Mr Morsi as Israel&apos;s new conflict manager. Hamas has a different narrative. Whether a ceasefire takes effect or not, they will say their rockets established their reach over the majority of the population from Jerusalem to north of Tel Aviv. And far from being wiped out in the initial Israeli bombardment, they kept firing to the very end. At home, Hamas will have reaffirmed its role as the main resistance to the occupation \u2013 a role which it was in danger of surrendering to competitive militant groups in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is looking for an immediate gain from a ceasefire, if one were to emerge on Wednesday \u2013 the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt to commercial goods as well as civilians. This would mean that the siege of Gaza would also end, but Israeli objections to the linkage between the truce and the border crossing was one reason why agreement could not be reached . More significant, Hamas claims, would be the political gains achieved during the past traumatic week \u2013 the pictures of the Egyptian prime minister and Turkish foreign minister clutching dead Gazan children, the stream of visits and support from the entire Arab League. What did the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, sitting all on his own in Ramallah get? Tony Blair. Who is right? If he is persuaded to cash in his chips now, Mr Netanyahu&apos;s gains are tactical and short term. He will only have achieved one of the three demands at Cairo \u2013 that Hamas be responsible for policing a total ceasefire among all militant groups in Gaza \u2013 but he will not have achieved his demand that this agreement run for a stated minimum period of time or that a buffer zone be created. Hamas&apos;s gains are strategic \u2013 even if the fighting does not end at midnight. It is overstating it to say that Hamas has in the course of one week gone from isolation to achieve unity in the Arab world, but it has already achieved a huge diplomatic boost. If William Hague on Tuesday recognised the Syrian opposition as the legitimate government of Syria, Hamas moved closer in the eyes of the Arab world to occupy a similar position as the Palestinian government in waiting. It will not be the first time that Israeli military action helped Hamas, which does not recognise the state of Israel, at the expense of Fatah, which does. But the logic of this conflict is that the Palestinian leadership will be re-formed, and hardened.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T22:34:12Z", "title": "Gaza: storm before the quiet | Editorial", "sentences": ["Whether a ceasefire takes effect or not, they will say their rockets established their reach over the majority of the population from Jerusalem to north of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/20/gaza-storm-before-quiet-editorial"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "     A bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv has threatened to derail attempts to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israeli rescue services said that at least 10 people were injured in the attack outside the military headquarters. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, said: &quot;A bomb exploded on a bus in central Tel Aviv. This was a terrorist attack. Most of the injured suffered only mild injuries.&quot; The bombing comes as Hillary Clinton held meetings with Netanyahu and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, in an effort to bring an end to the bloody conflict, after arriving in the region on Tuesday. An expected ceasefire failed to materialise on Tuesday night, despite predictions by Hamas officials and the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, who has been acting as a mediator between the two sides, that a truce was imminent. Israel stepped up its bombardment of Gaza from air and sea overnight with munitions slamming into Gaza at a rate of one every 10 minutes at one point. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they had hit 100 targets in Gaza since midnight and intercepted 12 out of 29 missiles launched towards Israel from Gaza. Clinton&apos;s talks with Netanyahu in Jerusalem lasted late into Tuesday night. She returned on Wednesday for further talks with Israeli leaders after travelling to the West Bank to meet Abbas. She is due to travel on to Cairo to meet Morsi and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon later. Reports in the Israeli press said the failure to reach agreement on Tuesday was due to a disagreement in the Israeli cabinet between defence minister Ehud Barak, who was in favour of a truce, on one side and Netanyahu and the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, on the other. They were reportedly unwilling to accept the ceasefire on the proposed terms. However, the prospects of an Israeli ground invasion seemed to have diminished after Lieberman appeared to rule out such an operation before the January election, telling Ynet: &quot;We should leave this decision for the next government.&quot; Among the buildings struck in Gaza overnight were Hamas&apos;s civil administration building and a house belonging to Essam al-Daalees, a senior adviser of Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniyeh. An Israeli warplane first fired a warning missile before scoring a direct hit on the building, in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, flattening the property. Medics reported that one passerby was wounded. Al-Jazeera said its office suffered damage from the airstrike on the Hamas compound. A reporter said the windows were blown out but no one was injured. It was the latest in a number of media facilities to be hit. On Tuesday the building housing the AFP offices in Gaza was hit in an Israeli air strike. Israel&apos;s military said it had been targeting a Hamas intelligence centre in the tower. Also on Tuesday, three al-Aqsa journalists were killed by strikes that hit their cars. Reporters Without Borders has condemned attacks on news organisations as war crimes. In Israel, a direct hit from a Palestinian rocket set a house on fire in Be&apos;er Tuvia, the IDF said. The death toll in Gaza since the start of operation &quot;Pillar of defence&quot; rose on Tuesday to 138, including 34 children, according to Palestinian medical officials. Two Israelis were killed on Tuesday, a soldier and a civilian contractor. Their deaths brought the total number of Israelis killed by Gazan rocket fire since the start of the operation to five. An Israeli Defence Forces spokeswoman said 111 Israelis were wounded on Tuesday, an unusually high number, but it was later clarified that the majority had suffered trauma.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T11:34:54Z", "title": "Tel Aviv bus bomb injures at least 10 people", "sentences": ["     A bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv has threatened to derail attempts to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.", "Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, said: &quot;A bomb exploded on a bus in central Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/tel-aviv-bus-bomb-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel"], "article": "Everything about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict follows the same pattern over and over, including the reaction of Americans. In the first couple of days after a new round of violence breaks out, there is intense interest and passion, which is quickly replaced by weariness, irritation, and even anger that one has to be bothered by this never-ending, always-ugly and seemingly irresolvable conflict. These sentiments then morph into an attempt to separate oneself from the entire matter by declaring both sides to be equally horrendous and thus washing one&apos;s hands from any responsibility for thinking further about it (&quot;I&apos;m sick of both sides&quot;), followed by recriminations against anyone who actually has an opinion that is more supportive of one side than the other.  Esquire&apos;s Charles Pierce, one of the nation&apos;s best political writers, provided a classic case of this mindset yesterday in his post entitled &quot;There Is No Side Worth Taking In Gaza&quot;. The crux: &quot;I would like to have an opinion on this continual bloodletting that didn&apos;t sound banal but, goddammit, I&apos;m out of them. I am thoroughly sick of both sides here.&quot; One encounters a version of this mentality with increasing frequency each day that the violence escalates. This temptation is genuinely understandable. Few things are more depressing than paying attention to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The carnage and mutual hatred seem infinite. The arguments are so repetitive and fruitless. As is true in all wars, including those depicted in pleasing good-vs-evil terms, atrocities end up being committed by all sides, leading one to want to disassociate oneself from all parties involved. It is just as untenable to defend the indiscriminate launching by Hamas of projectiles into Israeli neighborhoods as it is to defend the massive air bombing by Israel of what they have turned into an open-air prison that is designed to collectively punish hundreds of thousands of human beings. Virtually everyone wishes the entire conflict would just go away. With the exception of extremists on both sides who benefit in various ways, nobody relishes having to become involved in any of this. It is exhausting, draining, soul-crushing, and miserable. Embracing &quot;screw-both-sides&quot; nihilism and doing nothing else is so tempting because it appears to provide relief from the burden of paying any further attention to the horrific violence or bearing responsibility for any of it. But for two independent reasons, this reasoning, understandable though it may be, depends upon patent fictions, and is thus invalid. The first reason, which I will mention only briefly, is that there is not equality between the two sides.  As my Guardian colleague Seumas Milne superbly detailed in his column Tuesday night, the overarching fact of this conflict is that the Palestinians, for decades now, have been brutally occupied, blockaded, humiliated, deprived of the most basic human rights of statehood and autonomy though the continuous application of brute, lawless force (for that reason, those who like to righteously condemn Hamas&apos; rockets (Pierce, defending Obama; &quot;he happened to be correct the other day. No country can tolerate the bombing of its citizens&quot;) have the obligation to state what form of legitimate resistance Palestinians have to all of this). Moreover, as these clear numbers from the Economist demonstrate, the violence and carnage so disproportionately harm the Palestinians that to suggest some form of equivalence between the two sides borders on the obscene. But the second reason, to me, is even clearer. The government which Americans fund and elect, and for which they thus bear at least some responsibility, is anything but neutral in this conflict. That government - certainly including the Democratic Party - is categorically, uncritically, and unfailingly on the side of Israel in every respect when it comes to violence and oppression against the Palestinians.  For years now, US financial, military and diplomatic support of Israel has been the central enabling force driving this endless conflict. The bombs Israel drops on Gazans, and the planes they use to drop them, and the weapons they use to occupy the West Bank and protect settlements are paid for, in substantial part, by the US taxpayer, and those actions are shielded from recrimination by the UN veto power aggressively wielded in Israel&apos;s favor by the US government. As the excellent Israeli writer Noam Sheizaf put it on Chris Hayes&apos; MSNBC program this weekend:   &quot;Ultimately, the status quo is the solution from the perspective of [the Netanyahu] government. . . . . There&apos;s no incentive for the current [Israeli] political leadership to move from it, especially with the free hand it gets from the world and from the United States.&quot;  Just consider the actions of the US over the last week as violence in Gaza escalated. On Tuesday, the US vetoed a UN Security Council cease-fire resolution on the ground, in essence, that it was too balanced. The US State Department publicly attacked its Nato ally, Turkey, for condemning Israeli aggression. As always, the US Congress and the US Executive Branch are virtually unanimous in their full-throated, completely one-sided support for Israeli actions. Last night, a producer for Rachel Maddow&apos;s MSNBC program, the long-time liberal blogger Steve Benen, gloated that the GOP&apos;s election-year attacks on Obama over Israel have been proven false because, as Benen noted [emphasis added]: &quot;An Israeli official close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Obama administration&apos;s response to the conflict &apos;has been everything we could ever hope for.&apos;&quot; Though it should produce serious dismay rather than gloating, Benen is absolutely right in his factual claim: Obama specifically and Democrats generally have long been, and still are, every bit as loyal to and supportive of all Israeli actions as the American Right believes the US should be. So this &quot;both-sides-are-hideous&quot; mentality is not what drives the actions of the US government. Quite the contrary: the US government is as partisan and loyal a supporter of one side of this conflict as one can possibly be. So if people want to rail against anyone who has convictions about one side or the other - Pierce: &quot;The only people who make me more ill than the two active sides in this endless slaughter are the people far from the killing grounds who are so very goddamn sure they know what to do . . . I hate the cheering squads over here today&quot; - then the place to begin is with the US government, the Obama administration, whose unstinting, multi-faceted support for and enabling of Israel is central to all of this. Pierce does say that &quot;I wish American arms and American dollars weren&apos;t being used to demolish entire impoverished neighborhoods,&quot; but in the next breath asks: &quot;People are waiting for the president to do something, but what is to be done?&quot; But he answered his own question: the US need not be, and should not be, such an active, one-sided participant in this aggression. That one should vehemently condemn rocket attacks on civilians and bombs on Tel Aviv buses outside of an Israeli military facility does not mean sanctioning the years-long fueling of the Israeli side of this conflict by the US government.  If one wants to try to wash one&apos;s hands of this entire matter by declaring both sides equally culpable, that&apos;s fine. But doing so requires an acknowledgment that the US government is doing nothing of the sort. It is fueling, funding and feeding the Israeli war machine, and, with its own militaristic conduct, is legitimizing the premises of Israeli aggression.  This is exactly what I was referencing when I wrote on Saturday that one must stop pretending that the US is some sort of helpless, uninvolved party in this war between two distant, foreign entities. That is complete fiction. If an American citizen really wants to advocate for neutrality on the ground that both sides are equally horrible and they&apos;re sick of the whole conflict and wish it would all just go away, then the place to begin with that advocacy is US government policy which, as unpleasant as it might be to face, has long been, and remains more than ever, a key force that drives the bloodshed.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T12:24:00Z", "title": "The 'both-sides-are-awful' dismissal of Gaza ignores the key role of the US government | Glenn Greenwald", "sentences": ["That one should vehemently condemn rocket attacks on civilians and bombs on Tel Aviv buses outside of an Israeli military facility does not mean sanctioning the years-long fueling of the Israeli side of this conflict by the US government."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/21/israel-gaza-us-support"}, {"tags": ["David Cameron", "Barack Obama", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics", "US news", "US foreign policy", "European Union", "Europe", "UK news"], "article": "David Cameron has said Barack Obama must be persuaded to make the Middle East peace process a key priority in his second term as US president amid dwindling confidence that there is time left for a two-state solution.

Cameron said he had spoken twice to Netanyahu and once to the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, about the crisis over the weekend, and the foreign secretary, William Hague, was also involved in efforts &quot;to persuade both sides that we need a ceasefire&quot;. Beyond that, proper discussions needed to take place about the future of Israel and Palestine. Miliband said there was widespread support on all sides of the house for an immediate and durable ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, but he said confidence in a two-state solution was &quot;dwindling&quot;. &quot;This week has shown us once again that there is neither peace, nor a peace process, and the reality is that the international community does bear some responsibility for the abject failure of having those meaningful negotiations, nine years on from the promise of the road map for peace.&quot; The prime minister agreed time was running out and this could be the last chance for peace because the facts on the ground were changing. With time running out for a lasting solution, it was in Israel&apos;s interests to push now for the two-state solution, with pressure from the international community, he said. &quot;We do need a process to be put in place and I think that we need to do everything we can to persuade President Obama that this should be a leading priority for his second presidential term.&quot; But he added: &quot;While we all want this process and we all want this peace, in the end peace can only come about by Israelis and Palestinians sitting down and talking through the final status issues. &quot;They have to discuss borders, Jerusalem, refugees. In the end, as President Obama is fond of saying, and I would agree with him, we cannot want this more than they want it. We have to encourage them, we have to provide the framework, push for a process. But in the end we need courageous leadership from Israelis and Palestinians to talk through those final status issues.&quot; While Cameron and Miliband agreed on the urgent need for a ceasefire, they parted company over support for greater recognition of the Palestinians at the UN. The Labour leader argued this would provide an opportunity to support the process by backing &quot;enhanced observer status&quot; for the Palestinian Authority, and would &quot;strengthen the moderate voices among the Palestinians who want to pursue the path of politics and not the path of violence&quot;. Cameron said the problem would not be solved at the UN. &quot;It is our view that the Palestinians should not take this to the UN in the short term and we&apos;ve urged them not to do that. Clearly if they do so we will have to consider the right way to vote. But in the end the point is this: we will not solve this problem at the UN. This problem will be solved by Israelis and Palestinians sitting down and negotiating. There may indeed be dangers from pushing it too early at the UN in terms of a cut-off of funds for the Palestinian Authority and all the consequences that could follow. So in the end let&apos;s get negotiations going, rather than discussions at the UN.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T14:32:57Z", "title": "Cameron: Middle East peace must be priority for Obama's second term", "sentences": ["The prime minister made his comments to MPs in the Commons as the bloodshed of the past few days refused to abate, with Israeli air strikes in Gaza and a terrorist bomb attack in Tel Aviv earlier on Wednesday, which Israeli rescue services said injured at least 10 people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/21/david-cameron-middle-east-peace"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "LIKE A MONKEY WITH A MINIATURE CYMBAL Late last night, Chelsea sacked Roberto Di Matteo. They didn&apos;t bother putting up a statement on their internet site. Instead, they relayed the news using an animated gif picturing Punxsutawney Phil scuttling out of his hole and running up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole and running up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole. Anyway, it all happened very early in the morning (or very late in the evening, depending on how developed your problem-drinking is). This explains a lot. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay and chairman Bruce Buck had been under explicit orders from Roman Abramovich to &quot;sack the manager&quot; after the team were spanked 3-0, or 10-0 in moral terms, by Juventus in Big Cup, a result which leaves the holders unlikely to be holding on for very much longer. But Gourlay and Buck were feeling snoozy, and still had some sleepy dust in their eyes, and instead of firing Plain Old John Terry, the yawning pair accidentally handed the P45 to club mascot Di Matteo instead. The farce was further compounded with news that the security guard required to frogmarch Di Matteo off the premises is, because of the early hour of the dismissal, technically due to be paid double time, but wants to take a day off in lieu next week instead, and Chelsea are thinking about sacking someone else then. They&apos;ll probably have to nip down the agency to get a temp to cover for him. That&apos;s not the only knock-on effect of Abramovich&apos;s diktat, though. Chelsea are now looking for a new mascot to satisfy Abramovich and POJT, and reports suggest former Extremadura supremo Rafa Benitez is the chappie they&apos;re going to get. In many ways, that&apos;d be a strange choice. That&apos;s partly because the fans don&apos;t want him: two La Liga titles and a Big Cup is all good and well, but he&apos;s not yet proved he can throw a lasso around the moon, yank it down to ground, and convert it to diamonds, coins and marshmallow yum-yums, so fair play to them for standing their ground over that one. But it&apos;s mainly because the impressively belligerent Benitez \u2013 who has expressed interest in the role \u2013 isn&apos;t exactly the type to sit down, shut up, and smile nicely like a good boy while doing his boss&apos;s bidding. So if this deal does go through, sit back and wait for the kind of firework display over the Stamford Bridge boardroom that will make the immediate reaction to this appointment on Liverpool messageboards look like a damp squib. The first Catherine wheel will be lit in roughly 100 days&apos; time, 200 tops. By which time the Chelsea website editor will be dusting off that animated gif, with a view to coaxing Punxsutawney Phil out of his hole and sending him up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole.

When he departed during the White Album sessions the band desperately wanted him back and gave him an effusive welcome when he returned. Torres, not so much. Surely a more accurate statement would be that Torres not playing for Chelsea would be like Ringo not playing with the Rolling Stones?&quot; \u2013 Sam Fiddian (and no other musical-anorak pedants). &quot;Looks like Roman Abramovich has been quick to open talks with Pep Guardiola&quot; \u2013 Tom Cullen. &quot;Re: yesterday&apos;s last line.

On Saturday, Hamas claimed to have fired a Fajr-5 missile at Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s second most populous city, but Israel said the rocket was shot down by an anti-missile battery. Iranian officials initially distanced themselves from accusations they were supplying Hamas but now appear to be boasting about their role in enabling Palestinians to build their own Fajr-5 missiles, which have a range of up to 46.6 miles (75km). Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an influential MP who heads the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, had said at the weekend that the accusations were unfounded. But the Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, echoed Jafari&apos;s comments on Wednesday in saying that Tehran&apos;s support for Palestinians had military dimensions. &quot;We are honoured that our help has material and military aspects, and these Arab countries that sit and hold meetings should know that the nation of Palestine does not need words or meetings,&quot; he said, according to quotes carried by the semi-official Fars news agency. &quot;Our message is that if Arab countries want to help the nation of Palestine they should give military assistance.&quot; It was not clear from Larijani&apos;s comment whether Iran had actually smuggled Fajr-5 missiles into the Gaza Strip or if he merely went as far as the commander&apos;s remarks. Meanwhile, Fars, which is affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards, published an article boasting about the capabilities of Fajr-5, which it said &quot;changed the scene of the war between Israel and Palestinians&quot;. &quot;The world class Fajr-5 is a solid fuel, non-fixed wing, 333mm rocket designed and optimised for artillery missions to hit enemy&apos;s command and control, logistic, radar, communication, economic and political centres,&quot; Fars said. &quot;It is a rocket with 75km range, a payload of 178kg and speed of 1,009 metres per second.&quot; Earlier this year, the country&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all state matters, said Iran would help any group that fights against the &quot;cancer&quot; of Israel. &quot;We have intervened in anti-Israel matters, and it brought victory in the 33-day war by Hezbollah against Israel in 2006, and in the 22-day war [between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip],&quot; he said in February. &quot;From now on, in any place, if any nation or any group confronts the Zionist regime, we will endorse and we will help. We have no fear expressing this,&quot; he said at the time.

The blast, just yards from the city centre headquarters of the Israel Defence Forces, also revived traumatic memories of past bombings of buses, cafes and other public places. It was the first such attack in Tel Aviv since 2006. A device left on the number 142 bus exploded around noon, spreading shards of glass across the road and pavement. Fifteen people were taken to hospital, three of them with moderate to serious injuries, and others were treated for shock. Police said it was a terrorist attack. There were no credible claims of responsibility for the attack. In Gaza, where celebratory gunfire was heard as news of the blast spread, Hamas praised the bombing without saying it was responsible. &quot;We consider it a natural response to the occupation crimes and the ongoing massacres against civilians in the Gaza Strip,&quot; a spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, told the Associated Press. The blast came as the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, shuttled between Jerusalem, Ramallah and Cairo in an effort to promote a ceasefire in the Gaza war. She swiftly condemned the attack. Israel&apos;s top political leaders were uncharacteristically silent in the aftermath, suggesting that they may fear jeopardising the delicate negotiations in Cairo with hawkish statements. But the deputy prime minister, Silvan Shalom, described the bus bombing as an &quot;escalation&quot;. Some politicians, including the deputy speaker of the parliament, Danny Danon, urged the immediate implementation of provisional plans to invade Gaza. &quot;It is time to declare war. The time for restraint is over,&quot; he tweeted. Speaking at the scene of the blast on one of Tel Aviv&apos;s main roads, the police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said: &quot;It&apos;s very clear that this is a terrorist attack.&quot; Police set up road blocks around the city in efforts to catch the perpetrators. Rosenfeld said there had been &quot;no specific warning of an attack&quot; although security forces had been on high alert since the start of Israel&apos;s military offensive on Gaza a week ago. There was speculation that the attacker came from the West Bank. David Magriso, a lawyer, rushed to the scene from his nearby offices when he heard the explosion, thinking it was a rocket fired from Gaza. &quot;There was a lot of smoke and people running. The security forces were on the scene very quickly,&quot; he said. Among the crowd milling around the site of the blast were many who said the attack increased the necessity of a ground offensive inside Gaza. &quot;We need to finish this war for once and for all,&quot; said one. A paramedic, Israel Kornik, clad in bright blue surgical gloves and a reflective jacket, said he had helped a bloodied female passenger off the wrecked bus. &quot;She cried like a baby,&quot; he said. &quot;As I took her to the ambulance, she said: &apos;Tell [prime minister] Binyamin Netanyahu to be strong. Don&apos;t stop, finish the job [in Gaza], go forward.&apos;&quot; For Tamara Kessel, 54, who was standing next to the bus at the time, the blast instantly brought back the loss of her unborn child in a bus bombing in the city in 1996. &quot;I heard the blast, and fell to the ground,&quot; she said, still shaking with shock more than an hour later. &quot;This was the last thing I was expecting. You cannot live like this. All these traumas \u2013 it just goes on.&quot; Yafa Kessler, 46, who was also close to the scene, said it immediately reminded her of previous attacks. &quot;It surprised and frightened me because I thought the war was in the south. I didn&apos;t expect it to happen here. Now I&apos;m too scared to get on a bus.&quot; More than 1,000 Israelis were killed in repeated suicide bombings during the violent uprising against Israel&apos;s occupation between 2000 and 2006. More than 5,000 Palestinians were killed over the same period. In the past week, militants have fired at least four rockets from Gaza, 40 miles to the south, at Tel Aviv but none has made a direct hit. Israel has stationed an Iron Dome anti-missile defence battery to the south of the city. Five Israelis have died as a result of rocket fire. More than 140 Palestinians have been killed in air strikes and shelling inside Gaza. Chaim Shafir, who lives close to the site of the bus bombing, said he had been expecting a violent attack in the city. &quot;Paradoxically, maybe this will do some good. People only stop fighting when both sides realise there is no point. Maybe some sense will start to emerge.&quot; Describing himself as a game inventor, he said: &quot;Everything is a game in the end. From a gaming point of view, this [conflict] is a tie. But it&apos;s not over yet.&quot; In a statement, the White House said attacks &quot;against innocent Israeli civilians are outrageous \u2026 The United States reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to Israel&apos;s security and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people.&quot; Shortly before the blast, the British foreign office minister Alistair Burt, on an official visit to the region, warned that efforts to reach a ceasefire could be derailed. &quot;The longer time this goes on, there is more chance of a rocket causing serious death or injury, or an air strike changing things dramatically,&quot; he said. &quot;The ceasefire is in the balance, and it depends on events. Both sides could move close and then an unexpected event could throw it.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T16:50:00Z", "title": "Tel Aviv bus bombing hardens Israeli public opinion against Gaza ceasefire", "sentences": ["     The scorched carcass and blown windows of a Tel Aviv bus have raised fears among the Israeli public that the war in Gaza is poised to embroil its major population centres, hardening opinion against a possible ceasefire to end the eight-day-old conflict.", "It was the first such attack in Tel Aviv since 2006.", "Speaking at the scene of the blast on one of Tel Aviv&apos;s main roads, the police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said: &quot;It&apos;s very clear that this is a terrorist attack.&quot; Police set up road blocks around the city in efforts to catch the perpetrators.", "In the past week, militants have fired at least four rockets from Gaza, 40 miles to the south, at Tel Aviv but none has made a direct hit."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/tel-aviv-bus-bomb-gaza-spread"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Hamas", "Egypt", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Africa", "Mohamed Morsi", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton"], "article": "     Israel and the Palestinians have bowed to US and international pressure and agreed an end to eight days of fighting in the Gaza Strip that has claimed more than 160 lives. Under the truce, which came into force at 9pm local time (7pm GMT) and will be guaranteed by Egypt on the Palestinian side, Israel agreed to &quot;stop all hostilities in the Gaza Strip by land, sea and air including incursions and targeting of individuals&quot;. In exchange it committed &quot;all Palestinian factions&quot; to &quot;stop all hostilities from the Gaza Strip against Israel including rocket attacks and all attacks along the border&quot;. Leaders on both sides were quick to claim victory. Khaled Meshaal, the exiled leader of Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, said at a press conference in Cairo that Israel had &quot;failed in its adventure&quot; when it launched attacks on Gaza and had been forced to accept Palestinian terms. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said Israel had destroyed thousands of missiles as well as Hamas installations. Israeli operations and Hamas missile fire continued right up to the deadline, claiming at least one further Palestinian fatality, a member of Islamic Jihad. Israeli drones were continuing to fly overhead after the ceasefire had come into effect. Celebratory gunfire rang out across Gaza. The truce \u2013 announced in Cairo by Egypt&apos;s foreign minister, Mohamed Kamel Amr, and the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton \u2013 also included a pledge to open border crossings. That could ease the five-year blockade of the coastal enclave, a key point that is certain to be the focus of differing interpretations as the dust settles. But even as the truce was being announced, Netanyahu was warning more &quot;forceful&quot; action might be required if the ceasefire failed \u2013 a reference to a threatened ground invasion of Gaza that was postponed by Israel after pressure from the US president, Barack Obama. Speaking at a press conference, Netanyahu said the operation had destroyed &quot;thousands of missiles&quot; as well as Hamas installations. Israel could not &quot;sit with their arms folded&quot; under attack, he said. He also repeated his veiled threat of a wider army operation if the ceasefire failed: &quot;I know there are citizens expecting a more severe military action, and perhaps we shall need to do so.&quot; Netanyahu&apos;s statement came as an instant poll by Israel&apos;s Channel 2 television revealed that 70% of Israelis opposed the ceasefire deal. Meshaal, speaking in Cairo, welcomed the ceasefire and said &quot;the Israeli conspiracy&quot; that had sought election propaganda and to &quot;test Egypt&quot; had &quot;failed in its objectives&quot;. After the deal was struck Obama called Netanyahu to commend him for agreeing to the Egyptian proposal and told him he would seek more money for the Iron Dome defence system that has protected Israel from rocket attacks. Earlier in the day rumours had been circulating that Israel had been planning to announce a unilateral ceasefire that would be followed by Hamas doing the same thing. Israel launched well over 1,500 air strikes and other attacks on targets in Gaza, while more than 1,000 rockets pounded Israel after the fighting began on 14 November. The conflict has claimed the lives of at least 161 Palestinians, including dozens of civilians, while five Israelis died. Announcing the ceasefire in Cairo, Clinton commended Egypt&apos;s mediation. &quot;This is a critical moment for the region. Egypt&apos;s new government is assuming the responsibility and leadership that has long made this country a cornerstone for regional stability and peace.&quot; She also thanked Egypt&apos;s Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, for his mediation efforts and pledged to work with partners in the region &quot;to consolidate this progress, improve conditions for the people of Gaza, and provide security for the people of Israel&quot;. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, welcomed the deal as &quot;an important step towards a lasting peace&quot;. He added: &quot;The priority now must be to build on the ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict, including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons.&quot; Despite securing support from western governments for its initial military operation against Hamas, Israel had failed to win US and European backing for a ground invasion as a series of key US allies in the region, led by Egypt and Turkey, strongly protested against the Israeli assault. The agreed truce, mediated by Morsi and his spy chief, Mohamed Shehata, came after days of talks and frantic shuttle diplomacy involving regional leaders, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Clinton. Clinton had been engaged in talks with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah before flying to Cairo to meet Morsi. Obama also intervened during a tour of Asia to call both Israel and Morsi to encourage them to find a solution, as well as making several calls to Netanyahu and Morsi. The deal as it stands \u2013 despite comments by Clinton that efforts would continue for a wider settlement \u2013 leaves considerable areas of friction and uncertainty. However, an Israeli government source said, following the ceasefire agreement, an &quot;ongoing dialogue will start within 24 hours&quot; covering underlying issues of concern to both parties. They include the further relaxation of border restrictions and the issue of targeted assassinations. On borders, he said: &quot;These restrictions were imposed in the framework of hostilities.&quot; In the absence of hostilities, they may no longer be necessary. Targeted assassinations, he added, were &quot;an irrelevant question&quot;. &quot;If they are not attacking us, we don&apos;t need to shoot them.&quot; Two other issues to be discussed in further talks were the rearming of militant groups and the Israeli-imposed buffer zone inside the Gaza border. The source said: &quot;The buffer zone was only introduced in the framework of hostilities.&quot; An earlier attempt to reach a truce 24 hours earlier, which had envisaged a lull in hostilities leading to wider negotiations over key issues, including a lifting of the Israeli blockade of the coastal strip, fell apart because of internal opposition on both sides. The last week of violence has seen Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood-led government emerge as a key force in a region transformed by the Arab spring. The agreement emerged despite a bus bombing in Tel Aviv that injured 15 Israelis close to the country&apos;s defence ministry. Israeli police quickly said it was a terrorist incident, immediately awakening fears of a return to the sort of violence associated with the period of the second Palestinian intifada or uprising, in which some 1,000 Israelis and 5,000 Palestinians were killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. A Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, called it &quot;a natural response to crimes of the occupation and the ongoing massacres against civilians in Gaza&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T20:57:00Z", "title": "Gaza ceasefire announced in Cairo", "sentences": ["The agreement emerged despite a bus bombing in Tel Aviv that injured 15 Israelis close to the country&apos;s defence ministry."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/gaza-ceasefire-announced-cairo"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Hamas", "Egypt", "Africa", "Mohamed Morsi"], "article": "Outside the confines of an Israeli election campaign, it is hard to see the last eight days of aerial bombardment of Gaza as a tactical success. What started from the Israeli defence establishment&apos;s view with a moment of elation \u2013 the pinpoint strike on the car of Hamas&apos;s military commander Ahmed al-Jaabari \u2013 ended with Hamas and other militant groups breaking two taboos: firing rockets repeatedly at Tel Aviv (not even Hezbollah during the height of the second Lebanon war did that); and returning to the tactic of bombing buses. If the agreement announced on Wednesday night holds, Hamas is hardly ceasing fire while in full retreat. Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak now find themselves in a similar position to the one Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni found themselves in at the end of Operation Cast Lead in 2008 \u2013 struggling to pull something out of the rubble that justifies the decision to attack in the first place. They will claim that they established deterrence against the militant groups in Gaza for at least a couple of years. Hamas has agreed to not fire rockets, detonate bombs or engage in any cross-border activity, but all of that was on offer, and had been the subject of negotiations through intermediaries, before Operation Pillar of Defence was launched. Further, the agreement signed on Wednesday states that all crossings into Gaza \u2013 presumably not just the Rafah border with Egypt but the ones on the Israeli side as well \u2013 will be open to the movement of people and goods. In other words, the siege of Gaza, which Israel fought so bitterly and for so long to maintain, has just ended. The agreement refers to the fact that procedures for implementation will be &quot;dealt with&quot; within 24 hours of the start of the ceasefire. This was Hamas&apos;s central demand, and it appears to have been met. Israeli negotiators had two demands: that the ceasefire last for a stated minimal period of time and that a no-fire zone be established on the border. Neither are in the agreement. Strategically, the judgment on the last week of war looks even worse. Look no further than what has been happening all this week in the West Bank. In 2008, it was a mortuary and Ramallah seemed to be on a different planet. Not a Palestinian voice dared to be raised against the Israeli ground incursion into Gaza. Dissenters were swiftly locked up by Palestinian policemen. This week, in contrast, the Palestinian police have been strangely inactive. Demonstrations have erupted in major West Bank cities, molotov cocktails have been thrown. On Wednesday both nationalist and Islamic politicians called for a strike in the Hebron region. These are scenes not witnessed since the end of the second intifada. Just as the final link in the physical separation of Hamas in Gaza appears to have dissolved, so the taboo on its political reappearance in the West Bank appears to have melted away also. For the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, this is terrible news. Unity between Fatah and Hamas is de facto being forged, despite his, America&apos;s, and the Middle East Quartet&apos;s best efforts to exclude the Gazan militants from the political process until they recognise the state of Israel. Wednesday night ended with praise being showered by Israel and Hillary Clinton on the Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi. They have just cemented the international standing of a man whose chances they tried their best to undermine five months ago. Mr Netanyahu claimed that he had crippled Hamas and in heeding the warnings about a ground incursion, he will have cemented his western support. But that has been at the cost of elevating Hamas&apos;s position in the Arab world. He has now done to the organisation what he did to Khaled Meshaal, when he ordered his assassination by poison and was then forced to supply Jordan with the antidote. Meshaal&apos;s career was propelled as a result. In the same way, Hamas has been elevated into the position of a contender for the leadership of the PLO. Is this what the Israeli premier intended? Or has he just discovered the limits of the use of force? Instead of trying to wipe Hamas out, perhaps Mr Netanyahu should try talking to them.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T21:06:30Z", "title": "Gaza: the uselessness of force | Editorial", "sentences": ["What started from the Israeli defence establishment&apos;s view with a moment of elation \u2013 the pinpoint strike on the car of Hamas&apos;s military commander Ahmed al-Jaabari \u2013 ended with Hamas and other militant groups breaking two taboos: firing rockets repeatedly at Tel Aviv (not even Hezbollah during the height of the second Lebanon war did that); and returning to the tactic of bombing buses."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/21/gaza-uselessness-of-force-editorial"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "     Celebratory bursts of gunfire, cheering and chanting could be heard within minutes of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas coming into effect on Wednesday as gunmen emerged on the streets of Gaza City to claim victory. Some people let off fireworks from rooftops. Others drove through the city with horns blaring. But in Israel, relief at the war&apos;s end was imbued with caution, scepticism and opposition to striking a deal with Hamas. Many were waiting to see if the deal would hold before celebrating. Along Gaza City&apos;s waterfront, a loudspeaker on a mosque repeated over and over: Allahu Akbar. &quot;Israel begged for a ceasefire because it could not stop our rockets,&quot; said Adel Mansour. &quot;They bombed us, they killed our women and children, but they could not stop the resistance. So they had to surrender and agree to stop the assassinations. They learned we cannot be defeated by their bombs.&quot; Support for Hamas has strengthened inside Gaza in recent days because it has been seen to stand up to Israel. There is little debate about the cost in lives. &quot;Our martyrs are the price we must pay,&quot; said Mansour. &quot;But it is the Israelis who have their blood on their hands.&quot; Right up to the 9pm local time deadline for the ceasefire to kick in, Gaza City continued to be rocked by massive blasts. At least one person was killed in the final minutes of fighting. Hamas &quot;resistance&quot; \u2013 through the barrage of rockets into Israel \u2013 is seen as having deterred a ground invasion and forced the Israelis into an agreement to stop targeted assassinations. The ceasefire brought relief and a halt to the rising death toll. More than 140 people have been killed in Gaza in the past eight days, while five Israelis lost their lives. In Israel, there was significant opposition to the deal. A snap poll by Israel&apos;s Channel 2 found that 70% did not support signing a ceasefire with Hamas, with just 24% in favour. Some residents in southern cities took to the streets on Wednesday to protest against the deal, Israeli television reported. All schools and businesses within 25 miles of Gaza were to remain closed on Thursday. David Magriso, a lawyer who earlier rushed to the scene of Wednesday&apos;s Tel Aviv bus bombing from his nearby offices when he heard the blast, said: &quot;I want to be optimistic, but I can&apos;t rule out being pessimistic. We hope that we will have quiet. I have no doubt that it will hold from our side, but terror organisations do not have the same discipline.&quot; That view was echoed by other Israelis who have spent the past week under a barrage of rocket fire from Gaza. Ya&apos;ara Menachim, a teacher in Sderot, the town closest to the Gaza border, said: &quot;This is a pause, not a peace. We don&apos;t believe in ceasefires any more.&quot; Zmira Ben Yosef, the headmaster of a school that has been closed for the past eight days, said: &quot;I just want this to be over. For the past two hours there has been silence, and I hope it will go on. But I don&apos;t trust Hamas.&quot; Earlier, several of those milling around the site of the bus bombing had insisted that Israel should fight on, with troops and tanks on the ground in Gaza. &quot;We need to finish this war for once and for all,&quot; said an onlooker. Paramedic Israel Kornik, clad in bright blue surgical gloves and a reflective jacket, said he had helped a bloodied woman passenger off the wrecked bus. &quot;She cried like a baby,&quot; he said. &quot;As I took her to the ambulance, she said &apos;tell [prime minister] Binyamin Netanyahu to be strong. Don&apos;t stop, finish the job [in Gaza], go forward&apos;.&quot; Following the blast, in which 15 Israelis were injured, Danny Danon, the deputy speaker of Israel&apos;s parliament, urged an immediate ground invasion of Gaza. &quot;It is time to declare war. The time for restraint is over,&quot; he tweeted. The blast revived traumatic memories of past bombings of buses, cafes and other public places. It was the first such attack in Tel Aviv since 2006. Tamara Kessel, 54, who was standing next to the bus at the time, lost her unborn child in a bus bombing in the city in 1996. &quot;I heard the blast, and fell to the ground,&quot; she said, still shaking with shock more than an hour later. &quot;This was the last thing I was expecting. You cannot live like this. All these traumas \u2013 it just goes on.&quot; Chaim Shafir, who lives nearby, said he had been expecting a violent attack in the city. &quot;Paradoxically, maybe this will do some good. People only stop fighting when both sides realise there is no point. Maybe some sense will start to emerge.&quot; During the eight-day war, the Israeli military targeted more than 1,500 sites in Gaza with airstrikes and shelling. It said more than 1,000 rockets had been fired at Israel.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T21:38:10Z", "title": "Gaza City residents celebrate Hamas ceasefire with Israel", "sentences": ["David Magriso, a lawyer who earlier rushed to the scene of Wednesday&apos;s Tel Aviv bus bombing from his nearby offices when he heard the blast, said: &quot;I want to be optimistic, but I can&apos;t rule out being pessimistic.", "It was the first such attack in Tel Aviv since 2006."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/gaza-city-residents-celebrate-ceasefire-israel"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "Hamas", "Egypt", "Africa"], "article": "     It is the way of all negotiations, particularly ones conducted under intense pressure and when the stakes are so high, that each party seeks to put a positive spin when the deal has been done. So it was on Wednesday, in Gaza, Jerusalem, and Cairo as the protagonists explained what had been achieved after eight days of bloodshed, some 145 dead and fears around the world of the possible eruption of a wider Middle Eastern war. Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, was upbeat, claiming that all its demands had been met. Israeli leaders sounded an equally triumphant note, insisting \u2013 though less convincingly \u2013 that Operation Pillar of Defense had reached its goals. Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, paid tribute to the armed forces and said that Hamas had suffered &quot;serious blows&quot;. Khaled Mashaal, the Hamas leader, said that Israel had suffered a &quot;great defeat&quot;. The key details of the agreement are sketchy but significant. The most important is the promised end to all Israeli assassinations and incursions into Gaza \u2013 a reminder that this latest round of bloodshed began with the &quot;targeted killing&quot; of the Hamas military leader Ahmed al-Jaabari last Wednesday. All Palestinian factions will in turn stop cross-border attacks into Israel. Hamas will thus be required to impose its will on more radical groups such as Islamic Jihad, a return to the old arrangement \u2013 which raises the question of how much has been achieved in the past week. Written pledges of that kind may be worth something \u2013 but they are very easily broken. More important is the clause about opening border crossings and &quot;facilitating&quot; the movement of people and goods in and out of the strip. Crucially, no details appear to have been agreed on how and where this is to be implemented, though the matter is to be &quot;dealt with&quot; 24 hours after the start of the truce. There is talk of the creation of a new &quot;liaison mechanism&quot;. It is a safe bet that it is unlikely to work smoothly for very long. Strikingly absent from the agreement is any sign that Egypt has pledged to do anything to control the flow of weapons via the network of tunnels into Gaza. Israel has been insisting that it wants action from Egypt and the wider international community to curb arms smuggling. Failure to achieve that will attract criticism in Israel. Nothing positive can be said about longer-term prospects for repairing the bitter divisions between Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, though Hillary Clinton tried hard to advertise the relevance of Mahmoud Abbas when she met the Palestinian president in Ramallah. Nor, with Israeli elections due in January, is there much chance of fundamental changes in Israeli policy on building settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It is no surprise Hamas claimed victory for the &quot;resistance&quot;. Its deployment of longer-range rockets that managed to hit Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel&apos;s densely populated heartland showed that it has acquired a short-lived strategic advantage, though it was not enough to tip the overall strategic balance away from the fourth most powerful army in the world \u2013 and it came again at a terrible cost to its own people. But signing a truce with Israel \u2013 albeit via a third party \u2013 is an indication of its enhanced status. It remains in power. But if the status quo does not change, its reputation will suffer. The biggest winner from this hard-fought agreement is Mohamed Morsi, Egypt&apos;s new president. The Islamist leader has deftly juggled sympathy for Hamas with Egypt&apos;s strategic national interests and helped to produce a breakthrough that, for the moment, can only enhance his role as a key regional player \u2013 and underline the difference between him and the overthrown Hosni Mubarak. Lavish praise from the US and even Israel was a mark of what looks like being one of the most substantial changes of the Arab spring.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T21:57:08Z", "title": "Israel-Hamas ceasefire: how much has been achieved in the past week?", "sentences": ["Its deployment of longer-range rockets that managed to hit Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel&apos;s densely populated heartland showed that it has acquired a short-lived strategic advantage, though it was not enough to tip the overall strategic balance away from the fourth most powerful army in the world \u2013 and it came again at a terrible cost to its own people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/israel-hamas-ceasefire-how-much-has-been-achieved"}, {"tags": ["Egypt", "Mohamed Morsi", "Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Hamas"], "article": "As the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, flew into Cairo on Wednesday to help seal the deal that would bring an end to a week of conflict in Gaza, a plume of smoke was visible from the Kasr an-Nile bridge. Half an hour earlier, a group of several hundred demonstrators had torched a studio used by al-Jazeera television. That event, on the third day of clashes with police, underlined the contradictions of Egypt under President Mohamed Morsi, even as he emerged as an important new player on the international stage. For while Morsi has skilfully negotiated the first major foreign policy crisis since the fall of Hosni Mubarak&apos;s regime, that success masks a host of challenges ahead for him. In the immediate aftermath of the truce announcement on Wednesday, Morsi was lauded by Clinton. &quot;I want to thank President Morsi for his personal leadership to de-escalate the situation in Gaza and end the violence,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a critical moment for the region. Egypt&apos;s new government is assuming the responsibility and leadership that has long made this country a cornerstone of regional stability and peace.&quot; Over the past few days Morsi has met with Turkey&apos;s prime minister and the emir of Qatar, and hosted Germany&apos;s foreign minister and Arab officials. An Israeli envoy flew secretly into Cairo for talks with Egyptian security officials, though Morsi did not meet or speak directly with any Israelis. In the end the truce, and his role in it, was an extraordinary achievement. The question, however, is whether Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt may come to regret their key role. For while the deal has established Egypt as a key regional leader in the region with Turkey and Qatar \u2013 all US allies \u2013 the truce negotiated by Morsi and his spy chief, Mohamed Shehata, also inserts Egypt as guarantor of Gaza and Hamas. The irony is that asking Egypt to take greater responsibility for Gaza, which it administered until 1967, is precisely what some Israeli politicians have long desired: to hive off the problem of Gaza to Cairo, which would further stifle any possibility of a two-state solution. Indeed, Morsi may find the truce easier to negotiate than what follows: his predecessor, Mubarak, chose to co-operate with Israel in maintaining the blockade of Gaza because of his enmity to Hamas, which emerged out of the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi, however, may find his difficulties reside in his movement&apos;s closeness to Hamas. Facing pressure from within Egypt and from Hamas to open the borders, he may, however, be deeply cautious of doing anything unilaterally that might underline the broader objectives of securing a Palestinian state. Indeed, as Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation told Time magazine in the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire: &quot;If Egypt opened the Rafah border crossing without Israel doing the same at its own crossings into Gaza, there&apos;d be champagne corks popping in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. They won&apos;t do that, because Egypt won&apos;t shoulder the burden of Gaza, which could end the possibility of a unified Palestinian state.&quot; On the Gaza front the deal may present other immediate problems. In the ceasefire negotiations Israel pushed hard for firmer Egyptian action on arms smuggling to Gaza through the northern Sinai, an increasingly lawless region where armed attacks on security forces by Salafists are so commonplace that on some roads the army abandons its checkpoints at night. The problems in the Sinai are not, as a recent International Crisis Group report made clear, simply a security problem, but also a complex political and economic one, which Egypt&apos;s new government has barely grappled with. &quot;Egypt has huge problems of its own,&quot; said one diplomat last week. &quot;It needs stability and it needed the prospect of war to recede. There is a question too of its military capacity to deal with issues like Sinai.&quot; Therein lies the problem. Critics allege that while Morsi has taken a high profile on the international stage he and his government have been far less successful in tackling his country&apos;s myriad economic, social and political problems. On the economic front, Egypt&apos;s deal with the IMF for a $4.8bn (\u00a33bn) loan, announced on Tuesday, obliges it to end subsidies on items such as fuel, which will lead, inevitably, to unpopular price rises at a time of growing hardship. Tourism, while slowly improving after the huge hit it took during the Arab spring, is far below pre-revolution levels. Unemployment remains high as does inflation \u2013 a dangerous combination \u2013 while crime has become a serious issue. The failure to prosecute members of the security forces who committed crimes, including killings, during the revolution and after remains a running sore in Egyptian society. In the past week Egypt was hit by small-scale confrontations between army and police, another worrying symptom. And almost unnoticed amid the intense focus on Gaza, a stream of groups \u2013 including liberals, Christian Copts, journalists and women&apos;s rights campaigners \u2013 have withdrawn from Egypt&apos;s constitutional assembly, which is supposed to draw up the country&apos;s new constitution, alleging that ultra-conservatives have taken over the process. Given all these simmering tensions, Gaza and the truce matters in terms of Egypt&apos;s domestic politics because it is an issue on which most Egyptians, from secular liberals to Islamist, agree. Should the truce agreement backfire badly it would have profound implications not only for Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood but for Israel: any alternative Egyptian government would likely be hostile to the deal. &quot;Morsi&apos;s popularity can&apos;t go on eroding like this for ever,&quot; rights activist Mohsen Kamal told Reuters. &quot;He is vulnerable to dramatic, and maybe even violent, changes if he ignores what is happening.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-22T11:26:53Z", "title": "Gaza crisis: will Egypt come to regret its role as peacemaker?", "sentences": ["Indeed, as Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation told Time magazine in the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire: &quot;If Egypt opened the Rafah border crossing without Israel doing the same at its own crossings into Gaza, there&apos;d be champagne corks popping in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/gaza-crisis-egypt-peacemaker-israel"}, {"tags": ["Hamas", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "It might not look like victory. Dozens of dead children among nearly 100 civilians killed. Hundreds more injured, some condemned to a life of struggle by terrible wounds. Houses flattened. Bridges, offices and stadiums blown to bits. But as life returns to what passes for normality on the streets of Gaza \u2013 once again clogged with people and traffic even as the Israeli drones continue to buzz overhead \u2013 many Palestinians regard the ceasefire that put an end to more than a week of incessant bombing and shelling as an Israeli surrender. The victor, they say, is Hamas, which faced down Israeli aggression and has emerged from years of diplomatic isolation to be embraced, if tentatively, by the leaders of a new Arab world. The lesson learned is that standing up to Israel delivers results that years of concessions under US peace plans and drawn-out negotiations have not. Western leaders from Barack Obama to David Cameron rushed to blame the bloody upsurge of violence in Gaza on Hamas and other armed groups firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, but Palestinians have a different take. The common view in Gaza is that the conflict was a war of choice by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Mkhaimer Abusader, a political scientist at Gaza&apos;s Azhar University, said there was a widespread belief that Netanyahu ordered the killing last week of the Hamas military chief, Ahmed al-Jaabari, to provoke a confrontation and launch a military operation in order to make himself look strong in the runup to elections in January. Opinion polls showed many Israelis favoured an invasion of Gaza to follow the air and sea bombardment. That Netanyahu did not order one is regarded in Gaza as evidence he was deterred by the scale of resistance by Hamas and other armed groups, even in the face of much larger Israeli retaliation, which surprised Palestinians. &quot;Palestinians were very happy to see rockets landing on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time. It may be crazy but there&apos;s admiration that Hamas was able to manufacture long-range missiles and deter Israel,&quot; said Abusader. &quot;Palestinians believe the Israelis were begging for a ceasefire. The conclusion Palestinians reach is that the way to get results is resistance, is to make the occupation costly to Israel.&quot; The ceasefire deal may not have got Hamas all that it wanted, but there is a commitment by Israel to ease the blockade that was imposed to break the Islamist group, and to end the kind of &quot;targeted assassinations&quot; that killed Jaabari. There is plenty of scepticism that Israel will deliver or that the truce will last, but the crisis has shifted the diplomatic ground by breaking the international isolation of Hamas imposed by the US and Europeans. Change was in the offing, driven by the Arab spring, not least in Egypt, where there is a new government more openly critical of Israel than its US-allied predecessor. Israel has alienated its only real friend in the region, Turkey, over the Israeli military&apos;s attack on the Mavi Marmara flotilla to Gaza in which eight Turks were killed. It was no coincidence that the first stream of regional political heavyweights to visit Gaza in more than a decade was led by the Egyptian prime minister and the Tunisian and Turkish foreign ministers. Scenes of the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, shedding tears in a Gaza City hospital over dead children, and saying he stood in &quot;solidarity with the Palestinian nation&apos;s suffering&quot;, were read in Gaza as proof they were no longer alone. Talal Okal was for many years among the leaders in Gaza of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian, a secular leftwing organisation decidedly different from Hamas. &quot;I am anti-Hamas. I am democratic. I am secular. But I admire what Hamas has done because they showed they were working underground secretly to challenge the Israelis,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we are facing Israel from a better position. We don&apos;t have a balance of power with Israel. But now, because of Hamas, we have influence in the region and that makes a better situation.&quot; But Okal said Hamas was still divided over how to take advantage. Its external leadership, led by Khaled Meshaal, has embraced the Arab spring as an opportunity for Gaza to declare autonomy. Hamas leaders in Gaza, led by the prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, remain allied with Iran and Syria, with an eye on extending power to the West Bank. Okal said that from his conversations with Haniyeh he thought there was growing confidence in Hamas that it could widen its support among Palestinians. &quot;I used to think Hamas is going to have a state in the Gaza Strip. But now I think Hamas is headed toward reuniting the Palestinian establishment pushed by the hope it will be in control [of Gaza and the West Bank],&quot; he said. That may be wishful thinking given the growing disillusionment among many people in Gaza with Hamas before the latest fighting. &quot;Before the war erupted, Hamas was under a lot of criticism,&quot; said Abusader. &quot;Hamas was accused of corruption, smuggling, mismanaging revenues, issues of land management. That&apos;s why Hamas had a government reshuffle a month ago.&quot; But that criticism has been silenced for now, and there was open support in the West Bank \u2013 where the Palestinian leadership there is often seen as weak for its emphasis on negotiation \u2013 for Hamas for fighting back against Israel. Hamas&apos;s political gains are at the expense of Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of Hamas&apos;s rival, Fatah. He was all but irrelevant in the recent crisis, with Hamas centre stage in the Arab world. On Thursday, Abbas was forced into a humiliating call to Haniyeh to congratulate him on his &quot;victory&quot;. The past week has been a severe blow to Abbas&apos;s strategy to bring about a Palestinian state. He has renounced violence and committed to a negotiated peace with Israel. He has followed the obstacle course laid out by the US and Europeans, and supervised by Tony Blair, of &quot;institution-building&quot; and security co-operation with Israel, with the promise of a Palestinian state dangling at some undefined point in the future. The result, as many Palestinians see it, is that Netanyahu has ignored and humiliated Abbas and continued Israel&apos;s expansionism with yet more Jewish settlement construction and measures to reaffirm Israeli control over all of Jerusalem and great chunks of the West\u00a0Bank. The lesson many in the occupied territories have taken away from the past week is that standing up to Israel brings results. &quot;The model that the US, Europe and Israel promote of giving the Palestinian Authority financial support to build institutions hasn&apos;t worked. What you see is more Israeli settlement expansion, more measures to make a two-state solution more difficult,&quot; said Abusader. The latest crisis puts pressure on Abbas over his plan to ask the UN general assembly to effectively recognise Palestinian statehood next week. Washington and European governments, which blocked a similar move at the UN security council a year ago, are telling Abbas the move will damage the prospects for peace. Israel is threatening to annul all or some of the Oslo peace accords if he goes ahead. But after the past week, the greater danger to his leadership may be how Hamas will exploit the situation if he does not. &quot;I think that if Abbas fails to upgrade Palestinian representation at the UN, that will be the end of him,&quot; said Abusader.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-22T16:44:18Z", "title": "Hamas emerges stronger from Gaza war after Israel ceasefire deal", "sentences": ["&quot;Palestinians were very happy to see rockets landing on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/hamas-stronger-gaza-israel"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Bashar al-Assad", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "article": "No one is taking bets on how solid the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians will prove to be. But the Gaza conflict has highlighted one apparently permanent change in the Middle East \u2013 the shrinking influence of Syria, stuck in a bloody and unstoppable war. If Mohamed Morsi, the Egyptian president, is now basking in glory as the indispensable mediator between Hamas and Israel, his counterpart in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad, looks distinctly like yesterday&apos;s man. Syrian state media focused intensely on Israel&apos;s onslaught against the Palestinians in Gaza. But Assad&apos;s Arab critics have been doing some bleak calculations: in the eight days of Operation Pillar of Defence 160 Palestinians were killed by Israel. In the same period, Syrian forces killed 817 civilians and injured thousands. Last Monday alone, says the opposition, 150 Syrians died. Al-Arabiya, the Saudi-owned TV channel, drove home the point about double standards nicely by quoting an Israeli rabbi who publicly urged his army to &quot;learn from the Syrians how to slaughter and crush the enemy.&quot; Any sense that the Gaza crisis was providing a handy diversion from the global attention to Syria was shortlived. Officially, Syria has been in the front line of confrontation with Israel for 64 years, losing the Golan Heights in 1973, the second of three full-scale wars, and repeatedly clashing with Israel in Lebanon. Five years ago, Israel bombed a suspected nuclear reactor in northernSyria. the neighbours have also been &quot;the best of enemies.&quot; Israeli leaders preferred Assad and his father Hafez as the &quot;devils they knew&quot; who kept the peace on the Golan, a quiet front until the recent spillover from the uprising and fears that chemical weapons might fall into the hands of rebels. Syria also spent eight years negotiating with Israel, though they failed to reach agreement. But the country that used to describe itself as the &quot;beating heart of Arabism&quot; has also been a leading member of the &quot;axis of resistance&quot; \u2013 an ally of Iran and patron of Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hamas finally abandoned its Damascus headquarters this year, unable to stand the contradiction between demands for Palestinian freedom and the brutal suppression of the Syrian uprising. In early November, the Syrian security authorities closed the Hamas offices. Khaled Meshal, its best known leader, is now an honoured guest in Egypt and Qatar, Assad&apos;s sworn enemy. Hamas, though still shunned as a terrorist group by the US, the EU and Israel, has far more respectable, and influential, Arab friends than Assad these days. Smaller Palestinian factions are still based in Damascus. One is the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine: General Command which claimed responsibility for Wednesday&apos;s bus bombing in Tel Aviv. But Palestinians living in Syria have suffered along with Syrians during the 20-month uprising. Assad is preoccupied with his own survival. But he is not the only Arab leader facing marginalisation. Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, has not had a good Gaza war either, praising Hamas but doing nothing to help it \u2013 and drawing attention to the fact that his organisation has not launched any of its thousands of missiles at Israel since the 2006 Lebanon conflict. Nasrallah&apos;s &quot;resistance&quot; credentials have also been badly tarnished by his support for Assad. Nasrallah may, some analysts believe, be keeping his powder dry in case Israel attacks Iran. Nearer to Gaza, another big loser is Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO leader and president of the Ramallah-based Palestinian authority. Abbas&apos;s problem is not new but has been exacerbated by a war against Israel in which his Islamist rivals have, with a degree of plausibility, claimed victory. It has also highlighted his irrelevance and exposed him to the charge that he is simultaneously too close to Israel while failing to extract any concessions from it. It is all evidence that old Middle Eastern certainties are disappearing while the precise shape of a new regional order has yet to emerge.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-22T20:41:38Z", "title": "Gaza ceasefire: Syria's shrinking influence now exposed | Analysis", "sentences": ["One is the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine: General Command which claimed responsibility for Wednesday&apos;s bus bombing in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/gaza-conflict-syria-influence"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Hamas", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "   Mazen Faraj and Robi Damelin \u2026 each has faced hostility from their own community.

But I don&apos;t know what revenge means. How many people should I kill? Would that bring David back? I was very motivated to find something that would prevent other families experiencing this pain.&quot; In 2002, David, a university student who had been doing his reserve duty in the Israeli Defence Force, was killed by a Palestinian sniper while he was guarding a checkpoint. Damelin, who was running a PR agency in Tel Aviv, could no longer work \u2013 it felt meaningless. A group called the Parents Circle Families Forum asked if she would like to join them: set up in 1995 by Yitzhak Frankenthal, whose 19-year-old son was killed by Hamas fighters, it now comprises more than 600 bereaved Israeli and Palestinian families working together to campaign for reconciliation. &quot;It was quite extraordinary to meet Palestinian mothers and discover this joint pain, and how powerful we could be as a force together to make a difference,&quot; she says. &quot;And so I got swept along, and it became more and more my life.

In 2002, his father\u00a0was shot dead by an Israeli soldier. &quot;Since I was a kid, I have been dealing with the conflict,&quot; he says. &quot;It is so hard to live in a country without security, justice, rights. After the loss of my father, I spent a lot of time not knowing what to do. It was a huge feeling. There are options \u2013 you can choose revenge and become a suicide bomber, or you can stay at home and die slowly with your memories, or maybe you can really do something useful. To become an extremist is the easy way, but to reach a solution in this conflict through dialogue, and to find understanding, would be more helpful for me.&quot; Joining the group, he says, felt like a rare choice he could make in his life. &quot;When you are living under Israeli occupation, you can&apos;t decide anything. The work with the Parents Circle, I have chosen it and I decide to do it, and I believe it&apos;s the continuation of the struggle.&quot; This doesn&apos;t mean group meetings are always easy, or that everybody always agrees, but they want the same outcome. A lot of their work is in education: Faraj and other Palestinian members go with their Israeli colleagues to speak in schools, reaching 25,000 students every year. &quot;When I was young, all I knew of Israelis was the soldier or the settler, but something happened to change that picture. I met Rami Elhanan [another prominent Parents Circle member], an Israeli from Jerusalem who lost his daughter in a suicide bomb attack. He talked about his suffering and pain, and I found a new picture of the Israeli side, which is the human side. It doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m falling in love with the Israelis or I forget what has happened in my life, but I have a new picture now.&quot; Each has faced some hostility from their own communities for the work they do and there are many times when their own commitment to reconciliation is tested. Damelin remembers hearing reports \u2013 mistaken, it later turned out \u2013 that the man who killed her son was one of the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who would be released in exchange for the safe return of the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Even though she has supported prisoner releases to ease negotiations, &quot;that was really a test. It&apos;s easy to talk about reconciliation and peace and it all trips off your tongue, but do you mean it? Sometimes it&apos;s very hard. You become very defensive about your own people. I love Israel. It&apos;s not that I have become a Palestinian. I just think that the occupation is killing the moral fibre of my country and for that I will fight.&quot; Damelin and Faraj both travel a lot, giving talks, meeting politicians and other groups. I ask what kind of picture she gets of how the conflict is viewed from outside and Damelin sighs: &quot;This whole idea of being pro-Israel or pro-Palestine \u2013 what comes out of that is that you are not helping either nation and you are importing our conflict into your country. That is very clear in Britain. If you are pro-Israel or pro-Palestine, and your leaders are encouraging this \u2013 some of your politicians, it is very clear whose side they are on \u2013 the Jews and Muslims here are beginning to hate each other. It&apos;s very easy for both the Muslim and Jewish communities in the diaspora not to compromise; they&apos;re not exactly put to the test every day. If you can&apos;t be part of the solution, I would really ask you to leave us alone. I really mean that.&quot; Damelin grew up in South Africa. Her recent return to the country was made into a film, One Day After Peace, in which she talked to people about South Africa&apos;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and what could be learned from it. &quot;The most amazing thing is that it&apos;s such an affirmation of the work we&apos;re doing now,&quot; she says. In South Africa she was an anti-apartheid campaigner but left in 1967, not quite believing apartheid would end: &quot;I believe that a miracle happened in South Africa and I think a miracle could happen for us too. I have hope. We can&apos;t afford to give up hope.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-11-25T21:01:00Z", "title": "The Israeli and the Palestinian: 'We have discovered this joint pain'", "sentences": ["Damelin, who was running a PR agency in Tel Aviv, could no longer work \u2013 it felt meaningless."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/israeli-and-palestinian-peace-campaigners-joint-pain"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza"], "article": "Ehud Barak&apos;s decision to quit politics means the departure of a man who has been at the heart of Israel&apos;s military establishment for more than half a century, either participating in person or masterminding many of its controversial exploits \u2013 including this month&apos;s assault on the Gaza Strip. Barak, 70, has never rated in the popularity stakes in Israel \u2013 one commentator called him &quot;the man everyone loves to hate&quot; \u2013 but he has always been known for his cerebral qualities as well as his long experience of fighting Arabs. He once described Israel as &quot;a villa in the jungle&quot;. According to some observers he has exercised a restraining influence on the Likud&apos;s Binyamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister, but he has been no less hawkish than his boss on the question of whether Israel should attack Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. As a politician Barak has had a chequered career. His term as prime minister from 1999-2000 was the shortest in Israel&apos;s history. He led the Labour party to electoral defeat against Ariel Sharon in 2001 and then left to found his own grouping \u2013 Independence \u2013 last year. But Independence has only four seats in the 120-member Knesset and seems unlikely to perform well in January&apos;s elections \u2013 which Netanyahu is expected to win easily. Drafted in 1959, the teenage kibbutznik \u2013 the eldest child of parents who immigrated to British-ruled Palestine from eastern Europe \u2013 left the Israeli defence forces (IDF) 36 years later as chief of staff and its most decorated soldier. Nicknamed Napoleon by his army friends, the young Barak (Hebrew for &quot;lightning&quot;) made his reputation commanding the elite Sayeret Matkal, the general staff reconnaissance unit, which often operates behind enemy lines. In 1973, Barak, wearing a female wig and high heels, led a commando raid in Beirut during which three senior Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) figures were assassinated in revenge for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. The scene was immortalised in Steven Spielberg&apos;s film Munich. Fans often speak of his laser-like determination, which critics have chided as a lack of peripheral vision. In 2008, the political columnist Nahum Barnea called Barak&apos;s decision to blockade the Hamas-run Gaza Strip an example of the difference between &quot;being smart and being a smartass&quot;. Only last month it was officially confirmed that Israel had assassinated the PLO&apos;s military chief, Abu Jihad, in Tunisia in 1988 during the first Palestinian intifada. Barak, then deputy chief of staff, is reported to have run the operation. That was part of an Israeli strategy that assumed, then as now, that there is a military solution to the Palestinian question. Barak became IDF chief of staff in 1991 but like many other generals, including his mentor Yitzhak Rabin, left the army to enter politics. He beat Shimon Peres to lead the Labour party and then defeated Netanyahu in the 1999 elections. As prime minister, he sought to reach a conclusive peace agreement with Yasser Arafat&apos;s Palestinian Authority, an attempt that culminated in the failed 2000 Camp David summit in Bill Clinton&apos;s last days in the White House. That led to the second intifada, which in turn brought his resignation in 2001. Barak&apos;s public image was badly damaged by the purchase of an expensive apartment in one of Tel Aviv&apos;s flashiest and most sought-after locations. Israel&apos;s yearning for experienced military leaders brought him back to political life after the 2006 Lebanon war and he became minister of defence. He seems to have a feel for what motivates his enemies and was widely quoted as saying: &quot;If I were a Palestinian I would have joined a terrorist organisation.&quot; Barak also stated during a US television interview last year that he would &quot;probably&quot; strive for nuclear weapons if he were in Iran&apos;s position.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-26T14:11:56Z", "title": "Ehud Barak: the military mastermind Israel loves to hate", "sentences": ["Barak&apos;s public image was badly damaged by the purchase of an expensive apartment in one of Tel Aviv&apos;s flashiest and most sought-after locations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/26/ehud-barak-quits-politics-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Ehud Barak", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Gaza", "World news"], "article": "Ehud Barak, who on Monday announced that he is quitting politics, has been the chief author of Israel&apos;s national security policy for a generation. He has served as military chief of staff, foreign minister, opposition leader, prime minister and currently defence minister, and his ideas underlie most war and peace decisions. Barak&apos;s failed peace proposal to Yasser Arafat is still widely considered to be the basis for any future deal, while his pullout from Lebanon in 2000 serves as the model for Israeli unilateralism. For better or worse, his conclusion of the Camp David debacle \u2013 &quot;We have no Palestinian partner&quot; \u2013 continues to be the mainstream political thinking in Israel \u2013 which makes him the anathema of Israel&apos;s dwindling peace camp. Barak made his name as a young officer in the special forces, where his daring, cunning and salesmanship propelled him to the highest ranks. He took his love of secretive schemes to politics, where he perfected the art of wrongfooting the media and the public. He did it again on Monday, announcing his withdrawal from the current election campaign less than a week after leading the IDF in Operation Pillar of Defence against Hamas in Gaza, which ended in another fragile ceasefire. A mathematician by training, Barak is the least emotional of Israel&apos;s leaders. Unlike prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Barak would rarely mention the Holocaust as the basis for policy, or ask the Palestinians to accept Israel&apos;s narrative. Barak&apos;s worldview is built around power. He views Israel as a western bastion in a hostile, Arab Middle East \u2013 &quot;a villa in the jungle&quot;. In his mind, the conflict is perpetual. &quot;Those who cannot cope with the situation here should move to Switzerland or Finland,&quot; he said during the latest round of fighting, when Tel Aviv was under rocket attack. Alas, Barak&apos;s lack of emotion also makes him the worst politician. Never a team player, he collected enemies throughout his career. To the general public, Barak is the &quot;most hated person&quot;. Several years ago he bought a luxury apartment in one of Tel Aviv&apos;s most expensive high-rises. It was a smart move financially (he sold it for a fortune) but a political own goal at a time when most Israelis complained about the rising cost of living. The arrogant nouveau riche from Akirov Towers became unelectable. One Israeli, however, couldn&apos;t care less about Barak&apos;s personal taste, and valued his strategic advice more than any other. Netanyahu was a junior officer under Barak and remains in awe of him. He kept him at his side as defence minister, giving him full authority over military affairs, and using Barak as his personal emissary to Washington. Since taking office in 2009, Netanyahu has focused on preparing Israelis and the international community for a historic confrontation with Iran. He found Barak a willing partner in making the case for the destruction of Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities as the only means to prevent it from getting the bomb and altering the regional power balance against Israel. So far their threats have rung hollow in the face of American opposition and an unenthusiastic public. But Netanyahu has warned that next spring or summer will mark the end of Israeli patience with diplomacy or sanctions, and it is widely speculated that Barak will join Netanyahu&apos;s post-election cabinet as a &quot;professional&quot; defence minister (ie not a Knesset member.) So they could still pull off their ultimate trick together. If Barak leaves the scene after the 22 January election, the leading aspirants for his job will be Avigdor Lieberman, the current foreign minister, and Moshe Yaalon, the deputy prime minister. Both are hardliners on the Palestinian issue and less hawkish than Barak on Iran. Lieberman lacks military experience, but has more political clout than Yaalon, the former chief of staff. Both aim for the leadership of Likud after Netanyahu, and would therefore steer the governnment further to the right, to appease their voter base. Barak was often criticized as &quot;Bibi&apos;s fig leaf&quot;, but his departure is bad news for Israel&apos;s moderates. \u2022 Comments on this piece will remain open for 24 hours, but may be turned off overnight", "publicationDate": "2012-11-26T20:15:01Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu's fig leaf could be back", "sentences": ["&quot;Those who cannot cope with the situation here should move to Switzerland or Finland,&quot; he said during the latest round of fighting, when Tel Aviv was under rocket attack.", "Several years ago he bought a luxury apartment in one of Tel Aviv&apos;s most expensive high-rises."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/26/binyamin-netanyahu-fig-leaf-ehud-barak"}, {"tags": ["Property", "London", "Capital gains tax", "UK news", "Money", "Tax", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Corporate governance", "Business", "Society", "Financial advisers", "Financial sector", "Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "Regulators", "Renting property", "Stamp duty", "British Virgin Islands", "World news", "Public finance"], "article": "This article is the subject of a defamation action by Raheem Jefferson Brennerman and Blacksands Pacific Inc.. The complaint states that Grosvenor Crescent was purchased by Icelandic investors not Mr Brennerman, that Mr Brennerman never had any ownership interest in that property and did not borrow any money from the Royal Bank of Scotland. It says Mr Brennerman was not the beneficiary of Trigon Trust and has not and will not receive any funds from it. The UK is increasingly turning into a property speculators&apos; haven, thanks to tax loopholes and the offshore secrecy offered by the British Virgin Islands (BVI) that hides many property transactions. We disclose the identities of some of the people secretly buying up Britain. The Guardian&apos;s investigation with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), covering nearly 60 sample premises, shows how anonymous buyers are taking over more and more blocks of luxury housing. Some purchasers live abroad; other buyers live in the UK itself while they build up property empires using these artificial structures. In 2011 alone, more than \u00a37bn of offshore money flooded into potentially tax-exempt purchases of UK houses, flats and office blocks. Most buyers snapped up property in central London. These offshore buyers are a driving force of the capital&apos;s spiralling property prices versus the rest of the UK: since March 2009, property prices in prime central London have increased by 49% \u2013 five times more than the rest of the UK, according to estate agents Knight Frank. In our findings, the majority of the offshore transactions used entities registered in the BVI, which accounted for \u00a33.8bn of the total: a continuing steep rise from \u00a32.7bn in 2010 and \u00a31.5bn in 2009, according to Land Registry data. Smaller amounts came from similar entities registered in Jersey and the Isle of Man. Among the commercial premises in London which have been acquired via offshore entities is the \u00a397m Riverside House, where the Ofcom HQ is on Southwark Bridge, which was bought by Ahron Frenkel through the BVI firm Alphagem, and the \u00a330m The Ark in Hammersmith, whose owner Murray Richards bought it through Centenary Financial Holdings. Reckless bank loans to offshore entities have fuelled much of the historic property boom, handed over by lenders who subsequently had to be bailed out. British banks had \u00a314.1bn outstanding in loans to BVI and associated offshore entities at the end of 2009, according to UK Treasury figures. The UK government allows property buyers to hide their identities on the official Land Registry, which is becoming meaningless as a result. Every year, ever more houses are being listed there as owned anonymously offshore. Since 1999, 94,670 offshore entities have been set up purely to hold UK property. Purchasers pay \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 fees to offshoring agencies for the privilege of not having their names made public. A trenchant government report by a Treasury official, Andrew Edwards, called for an end to this abuse in 2001. He wrote: &quot;Parliament has decided that ownership of property should be in the public domain ... The ability of owners to register land and property under names which conceal rather than reveal who they are flies in the face of the principle which parliament established.&quot; He said a truthful land register would be &quot;invaluable for law enforcement, regulatory and tax authorities&quot;, it would &quot;deter the unscrupulous from putting the proceeds of crime into property assets&quot; and would be &quot;helpful in tracing bankrupt persons and combating mortgage fraud&quot;. He added, tartly: &quot;If public policy emphasises privacy above transparency, the greatest beneficiaries are likely to be criminals.&quot; The then Blair government rejected his recommendations. Three major tax loopholes are currently fuelling the secretive offshore property boom: \u2022 No capital gains tax. Offshore entities, provided they are genuinely controlled and managed outside the UK, do not pay any tax on the proceeds of property speculation, unlike resident Britons. \u2022 No inheritance tax. People living abroad, and &quot;non-doms&quot; who say they are only living in Britain temporarily, can legally avoid inheritance tax by buying a house in the name of an offshore entity. It is then considered to be a tax-free holding in a foreign company, not a British asset. \u2022 No stamp duty. Anyone, British or foreign, can legally avoid up to 5% stamp duty being imposed on the next purchaser by holding their house in an offshore company. Upon sale, the company shares are transferred, not the house. The company has to be managed offshore, which also saves 0.5% duty on UK share transfers. These artificial techniques were partly outlawed by George Osborne in this year&apos;s budget, but only for the small minority of UK houses worth more than \u00a32m. Stamp duty loopholes The London-based developer Peter Vastardis is typical of those we discovered who have used such a technique. He set up VKT Investments, a BVI company with bearer shares that did not show the owners&apos; names. With a bank loan of around \u00a3750,000 he bought a house on Park Road near Regents Park, central London, in 2002, with partners from Athens, George Konstantopoulos and Nikolaos Trivyzas. Five years later, the trio sold the company shares to a businessman in Latvia, Valdis Bergins, for more than \u00a31m. No property sale was recorded at the Land Registry, so the SDLT (stamp duty land tax) saved could have been a hefty \u00a340,000. Vastardis told us: &quot;Everything was proper, nothing illegal about it.&quot; Such loopholes continue to be legal despite the government reform proposals this year, which only apply to mansions worth more than \u00a32m. Capital gains tax loopholes The software engineer Yair Spitzer from Golders Green, north London, went into the buy-to-let business with an opaque offshore structure that appears to have sheltered him from capital gains tax. His three north-west London flats made more than \u00a3280,000 gross profit over three years. One flat at Landau House in Kilburn was bought in 2004 for \u00a3140,000, with a \u00a3100,000 loan from the Kleinwort Benson private bank in Jersey. Let for \u00a31,000 a month, it was resold in 2007 for \u00a3185,000. The second flat, at Parade Mansions, Hendon, bought for \u00a3140,000, was resold for \u00a3207,000. The third flat, at Charlbert Court in St Johns Wood was bought in 2005 for \u00a3270,000, let at \u00a31,516 a month and sold on in 2007 for \u00a3440,000. The flats were purchased by BVI companies called Grassedge and Archcourt. Jesse Hester, a professional nominee in Dubai, was listed as director, and the shares were in turn owned by Spitzer&apos;s BVI-based Rocklea Trust. As the designated &quot;managing agent&quot;, Spitzer continued to control the business. He told us: &quot;We were advised at the time by UK accountants that this structure was appropriate for our circumstances and that it was perfectly legal. Rent was declared to the UK tax authorities.&quot; Complex structures Some of the British owners that we identified used particularly complex structures. The Yorkshire property developer Keith Wilson, for example, carried out a barn conversion in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in the name of a BVI offshore company called HMP Ltd. HMP was in turn owned by a second BVI company called Shortgrass, which he also controlled. Jesse Hester in Dubai was nominally recorded as the director. Wilson originally lived close to the farmhouse site, then moved into a \u00a3495,000 home in Retford, Nottinghamshire, in 2001. He borrowed \u00a3735,000 in 2009 to finance the development. He hoped, according to sources we have consulted, it would become worth more than \u00a31.3m. Wilson did not respond to invitations to comment. Behind another BVI entity, the so-called Inkwood Property Group, we found a Hertfordshire businessman, Lawrie Alderman, chairman of an advertising services agency, TPS Visual Communications. He set up Inkwood in 2001 and used it to purchase the freehold of central London office premises at Bakers Yard in Clerkenwell. He appears to have then arranged to set up an offshore Barclays account to pay in rents of up to \u00a315,000 a month for sub-letting the offices. Alderman did not respond to invitations from us to discuss these arrangements [see footnote]. Wealthy foreigners Some anonymous buyers prove to be wealthy overseas businesspeople, straightforwardly using the generous inheritance tax and capital gains tax advantages offered by Britain. Sir Sam Jonah, the Ghanaian former president of the Ashanti Goldfields company, for example, turns out to be behind the BVI-registered Windsor Properties Holding. He bought a flat in the company&apos;s name at Alberts Court, near Regents Park, for \u00a3640,000 in 2003. It was later transferred into a Jersey-based offshore family trust. He told us: &quot;I do not reside in the UK, so I was advised to use a BVI company for legitimate tax efficiency.&quot; Another businessman, the billionaire chief executive Bruce Rockowitz, who runs the Hong-Kong-based garment wholesalers Li &amp; Fung, bought a luxury London flat in Cadogan Square, Knightsbridge, and transferred it to an associate using an exceptionally opaque offshore technique. The flat was held in the name of a BVI entity, Billion Choice Investments Ltd. The BVI company was in turn placed in the ownership of an offshore trust, the London Trust, set up in the far-flung Cook Islands, in the Pacific, with Rockowitz himself named as the trust&apos;s beneficiary. The beneficiary was then switched, the flat sold for \u00a3790,000, and the cash placed in his associate&apos;s bank account. Rockowitz did not respond to invitations to comment. Property empires One of the most striking discoveries unearthed by the Guardian/ICIJ survey involves the number of anonymous property empires that mushroomed in Britain during the boom years, behind the screen of BVI offshore companies. British banks were willing to lend very large sums to these entities, some of which subsequently came to grief. Huge loans were made by the RBS bank in 2007 to a slew of offshore companies controlled by a 29-year-old Nigerian living in London, Ayodeji Soetan, also known as Raheem Brennerman and Jefferson Brennerman. With \u00a3118m from RBS and a further \u00a318m from HBOS, he bought property in Knightsbridge and the former Red Cross offices in Grosvenor Crescent, one of Belgravia&apos;s most expensive streets, aiming to develop flats for rich Russians and Chinese costing up to \u00a350m each. A Rolls-Royce was, he claimed, to be on permanent standby to chauffeur residents around the corner to shop at Harrods. We discovered that all the BVI companies trace further back to an entity called Nuevitas registered in the tiny Indian Ocean jurisdiction of the Seychelles. Nuevitas in turn controlled an offshore trust called Trigon, of which Soetan was the beneficiary. When his dreams of a tax-free property fortune stalled in 2009 with receivers being called in, Soetan moved to New York, where he now says he heads an oil exploration and energy trader firm called Blacksands Pacific Inc. He told us that our information was &quot;garbage&quot;, but declined to put any details in writing. Another unlikely character who amassed houses by the score in eastern England was Bobby Wahi. Operating from a local trading estate, he bought at least 42 premises that we have identified, in the Skegness, Mablethorpe and Boston area of Lincolnshire. Acquired in the name of a dozen different BVI companies, the purchases were fuelled by loans from RBS (again) and the then Britannia building society. Wahi, a former car dealer, told prospective customers he was a UN &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; and styled himself LL.B [Hons] and &quot;His Excellency&quot;. In the Caribbean, he also registered the short-lived &quot;Private Capital Bank&quot; of Dominica, whose licence was revoked following a change of local regime. After the credit crunch in 2007, the Co-operative Bank, which took over Britannia, appointed receivers, and was forced to keep Wahi&apos;s repossessed properties on its books. With a last-known address in Spain, he did not respond to the Guardian&apos;s attempts to contact him. The biggest and most reckless offshore bank loans of all went to a Briton living in immense style in London, who cannot currently be named for legal reasons. European banks which subsequently had to be bailed out by their taxpayers, handed over a total approaching \u00a31bn in loans to scores of his BVI companies. He acquired in this way some of London&apos;s most prominent buildings, before coming to grief. According to those who eventually lost millions, it was the anonymity provided by offshore firms which enabled him to make fools of so many bank executives. A luckier offshore tycoon was Andreas Stavrinides, of Cypriot origin but living in Essex. He is now the owner of the Skylark hotel in Southend, purchased for \u00a32.3m in 2010 in the name of the BVI-registered Elite Property Holdings. He built up his fortune with a string of care homes, largely financed with loans from Barclays to his two offshore companies: Elite, and Decolace Properties. The homes specialise in residents with dementia or psychiatric disorders, and charge at least \u00a3615 a week. His UK company Health and Home Ltd runs the care homes, paying rent to the landlord companies. Stavrinides told us: &quot;If I was recorded as a director and shareholder, [of the BVI entities] it would have been on a fiduciary basis. I don&apos;t know who the shareholders are. I believe it might have been a family trust&quot;. Some wealthy Israelis have also traded heavily in tax-free UK property behind the offshore screen. The art collector Joseph Hackmey, heir to an insurance business in Israel, moved to Kensington Palace Gardens in London, and set up more than 20 BVI companies with names such as Frentforth, Breezeknoll and Solsdeck. His purchases included: the Intrepid Fox music pub in Soho, since converted into flats, and an upmarket burger restaurant; the old Leinster Hotel in Ossington Street, Bayswater, west London, now a smart gym; and a luxury apartment in Palace Court, Notting Hill, west London. A second major behind-the-scenes Israeli operator we discovered is the lawyer Yoram Yossifoff. He has been involved in more than \u00a31bn of London property raids. An expert in what he calls &quot;creative tax planning&quot;, Yossifoff not only speculates on his own behalf, but, with his Tel Aviv-based Mydas Fund, fronts deals for consortia of other Israeli investors. A source familiar with his transactions justifies them, saying: &quot;The exemption from capital gains tax formed part of policies promoted by the [UK] government of the day to encourage inward investment.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 18 March 2013. Following publication, Mr. Alderman has asked us to make clear that although there were documents indicating that rent would be paid into an offshore bank account, the rent is and has always been paid into a UK bank account and fully declared for UK tax.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-26T20:58:47Z", "title": "How secret offshore firms feed London's property boom", "sentences": ["An expert in what he calls &quot;creative tax planning&quot;, Yossifoff not only speculates on his own behalf, but, with his Tel Aviv-based Mydas Fund, fronts deals for consortia of other Israeli investors."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/26/secret-offshore-firms-fuel-london-property"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Mahmoud Abbas", "Gaza", "International criminal court", "International criminal justice", "Law"], "article": "The card players of the Al-Amari cafe have been around long enough to take a sceptical view of the United Nations vote on Thursday to recognise Palestinian statehood. The men at the regular morning gathering inside one of Ramallah&apos;s dense refugee camps have seen invasion, occupation and peace talks come and go over the years. They&apos;ve listened to pledges from Arab leaders that Israel would be crushed from existence, and heard promises from American presidents of an independent Palestine living in harmony with a Jewish state. None of that has come to pass. So the card players agree that a vote at the UN only goes so far. But that doesn&apos;t mean they think it&apos;s not significant. Husni Khalil, 65, said the vote mattered because Israel had never explicitly recognised a Palestinian state, even though it demanded that the Palestinians recognise a Jewish state. That, he reasons, is because Israel wants to seize as much land as it can in the West Bank. But now the UN decision will stand in opposition to Israel&apos;s attempts to make historic and religious claims to territory that is supposed to be part of an independent Palestine. &quot;Instead of the land belonging to Israel, as the Israelis claim, the world will see that it belongs to us but is occupied by Israel. Palestinians want to live in peace alongside Israel. That&apos;s all we want. But they have to recognise we are a country, a state,&quot; he said. Ibrahim Khamis, a 58-year-old driver, breaks from the card game because he wants to be heard. &quot;This is important because we will be recognised as a country, not a disputed land. And if we are a country, then it will be recognised that we are occupied,&quot; he said. Many Palestinians are mystified over why Israel would oppose the UN move. It&apos;s not violent, it recognises Israel and it&apos;s legal, they say. The conclusion some reach is that Israel is only paying lip service to a Palestinian state. Majed Reehan, a 40-year-old accountant, who mentions in an aside that working with numbers gives him an advantage at cards, said Palestinians have followed the path of concessions, negotiations and meeting the requirements for recognition laid down by everybody from Bill Clinton to Tony Blair. So the UN vote is a just step. &quot;We have proved to the world we can build institutions and we can build a proper state. We have proved to the world we deserve a state. We have done what was asked of us,&quot; he said. &quot;The UN vote is a step forward but we will still be a state under occupation. Maybe it will not automatically improve things but it is something.&quot; Some European countries, such as France and Spain, shifted their support behind the UN request in part because they want to strengthen the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in the wake of the fighting in Gaza earlier this month. Hamas emerged from the war considerably more popular among Palestinians for firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, and for the first time striking at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Many Palestinians contrast Abbas&apos;s commitment to what is widely regarded as a failed diplomatic strategy, in which he has largely been humiliated by the Israelis as they continue to expand Jewish settlements on illegally occupied land, with what is seen as Hamas&apos;s success in forcing concessions through resistance. There was alarm in western capitals at the prospect of ordinary Palestinians giving up on negotiations and Abbas, who is also known as Abu Mazen, by concluding that Israel responds to force, not diplomacy. But the card players do not see the two positions in opposition. Reehan said the violence of recent weeks had strengthened Abbas&apos;s hand. &quot;What happened in Gaza was a boost to Abu Mazen at the UN and it&apos;ll boost him in negotiations,&quot; he said. Khamis noted that Hamas came out strongly in support of the statehood move. &quot;Hamas lifted our heads up high. We didn&apos;t benefit from the peace process. Abu Mazen said it clearly, we haven&apos;t received anything from the peace process. He said: &apos;I&apos;m not the ruler of my people, Israel is&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;Now Hamas has made him stronger. People are applauding Hamas; they respect Hamas. But Abu Mazen is our leader. He wasn&apos;t wrong to say we must negotiate. But Israel will only bow down before strength. You need negotiation but you also need resistance.&quot; As with many Palestinians who have lived through so many twists and turns of conflict and diplomacy, the men are well informed on the detail of what the UN vote will mean. One of the elements Khamis latches on to is also the most contentious for Israel and its closest allies: the prospect of Palestine using recognition as a state to pursue prosecutions at the international criminal court (ICC). &quot;We want the people who attack us held responsible,&quot; he said. &quot;At least we can hold the Israeli army responsible for the massacres against us.&quot; The Palestinian leadership has resisted intense pressure from the US and Britain to renounce the right of the Palestinian Authority to accede to the ICC. The UK said it would abstain in the vote over the issue, and a demand that Abbas agree to immediate unconditional talks with Israel. Still, Abbas&apos;s officials have made it clear that the Palestinian Authority will not be rushing to accede to the ICC. Khamis is not bothered. &quot;It&apos;s not a problem because we can keep it in our hands.&quot; he said, gesturing as though it were a valuable card in one of the games at the cafe. &quot;We can play it at any time.&quot; Reehan thinks the UN vote may actually benefit ordinary Israelis because it will remind them that they are better off negotiating than fighting. &quot;I think the average Israeli wants peace as much as us but they have a radical government. When the [Gaza] war was going on, they were running to their shelters. They don&apos;t want to live like this anymore than we do. Israeli people love life,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-29T15:46:05Z", "title": "UN vote on Palestinian statehood just another cautious step forward", "sentences": ["Hamas emerged from the war considerably more popular among Palestinians for firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, and for the first time striking at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/29/palestinian-statehood-united-nations-vote"}, {"tags": ["Sculpture", "Culture", "Art", "Art and design", "Crime", "UK news", "London", "The art market", "Turner prize", "Art theft", "Douglas Gordon"], "article": "It is a work of art by one of the world&apos;s most feted artists, the Turner prize-winning Douglas Gordon. It is also made from solid gold, with an insurance value of around \u00a3500,000 and, the Guardian has learned, the work has been stolen while in the care of Christie&apos;s, one of the most respected auction houses in the world. The artist fears it may have been taken for the scrap value of its metal, which he estimates to be around \u00a3250,000. &quot;I don&apos;t think this is an art theft,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure it has been melted down.&quot; Gordon, who won the Turner prize in 1996 and whose art is owned by museums including the Tate and New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art, is angry at the behaviour of the auction house. He said Christie&apos;s only told him about the disappearance of the sculpture after he had spoken about the theft elsewhere. Gordon, who owns the work, said: &quot;It is like someone borrowing your car, and then you finding out from a neighbour that it has been crashed,&quot; he said. &quot;It looks like I am the last person in the chain to know.&quot; Gordon said he had first heard of the theft second-hand, from a curator, last week; a Christie&apos;s representative contacted him on the morning of 29 November, 16 days after the crime was reported to the police. Scotland Yard confirmed it was &quot;investigating the alleged theft of a piece of artwork from a secure warehouse in the King Street area of Westminster. The incident was first reported to police on 12 November&quot;. A Christies&apos;s spokesman said: &quot;This matter is under investigation and we are in contact with all parties involved. We cannot comment further.&quot; A source at the auction house said Gordon&apos;s gallery had been informed right away, and that a Christie&apos;s representative had attempted to contact the artist on 28 November. The theft from Christie&apos;s storage facility \u2013 which claims on its website &quot;world-class security, management and expertise&quot; \u2013 is likely to cause significant reputational damage for the auction house. A spokesman declined to comment on arrangements at the storage facility, citing the need to keep security measures confidential. A source said: &quot;Given the sheer volume of works of art that come in, this as an extraordinarily rare thing to happen.&quot; The artwork, made in 2007, is called The Left Hand and the Right Hand Have Abandoned One Another. It is normally kept at Gordon&apos;s Paris gallery, Yvon Lambert. The sculpture was shown this summer at an exhibition of contemporary sculpture at Waddeston Manor, the Buckinghamshire seat of the Rothschild family now in the care of the National Trust. The work was available for private sale through Christie&apos;s, which organised the exhibition. After the exhibition closed on 28 October, the sculpture was returned to the Christie&apos;s storage facility in London for safekeeping. According to Gordon, documentation was signed showing the sculpture had been safely received; and, following standard practice in the artworld, a condition report was completed. But earlier this month, according to Gordon, &quot;apparently an employee randomly picked up the box it was in \u2013 yes, the phrase &apos;randomly picked up&apos; is the phrase I have heard \u2013 and discovered it was a bit light&quot;. The crate was opened and the artwork discovered to be missing. &quot;I had a call last Thursday [22 November] from the curator who had run the exhibition at Waddeston,&quot; said Gordon. &quot;But I only heard from Christie&apos;s directly this morning [29 November], although I understand the police are involved. Apart from the fact it&apos;s outrageous that something might get stolen from Christie&apos;s, I still own the work and I am the creator of the work. There&apos;s something going on here about value and the way the artist is treated in all of this.&quot; Gordon believes his gallery was told of the theft only when the sculpture was due to be taken out of the storage facility to be transported to Tel Aviv for an exhibition in January. Curator Katrina Brown, an expert on Gordon&apos;s work, said the piece occupies a significant place in the artist&apos;s oeuvre. The hand motif, she said, has been an important part of Gordon&apos;s work since the 1990s. For example, Feature Film (1999) was a film of the conductor James Conlon conducting Bernard Herrmann&apos;s score of Hitchcock&apos;s Vertigo, &quot;which focused on Conlon&apos;s hands as conveyers of emotion&quot;, she said. A precursor to the work in gold, Fragile Hands Collapse Under Pressure (1999), was a wax cast of the artist&apos;s hand. It was exhibited in 1999 at Sir John Soane&apos;s Museum in London. Gordon, who was born in Glasgow and is based in Berlin, is best known for his work in film, notably his 24-Psycho, an installation in which the Hitchcock film was slowed down so it took 24 hours to run; and Zidane: A 21st-century Portrait, which followed the footballer Zinedine Zidane during a football match. He won the Turner prize in 1996. &quot;He is best known for his film work and hardly ever makes objects,&quot; said Brown. &quot;When he does, they tend to be pretty potent.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 3 December 2012 to correct the year Douglas Gordon won the Turner prize.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-29T18:32:59Z", "title": "Turner prize-winner's work stolen from Christie's", "sentences": ["There&apos;s something going on here about value and the way the artist is treated in all of this.&quot; Gordon believes his gallery was told of the theft only when the sculpture was due to be taken out of the storage facility to be transported to Tel Aviv for an exhibition in January."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/29/turner-sculpture-stolen-christies"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Uefa", "Football", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Sport"], "article": "A group of Premier League footballers and players in other major European leagues have condemned plans to hold the Under-21 European championship in Israel next year, saying it will be seen as a &quot;reward&quot; for this month&apos;s assault on Gaza in which young people playing football were killed when a sports stadium was bombed. The signatories, who include Eden Hazard of Chelsea, Abou Diaby of Arsenal and four Newcastle players \u2013 Papiss Ciss\u00e9, Cheick Tiot\u00e9, Sylvain Marveaux and Demba Ba \u2013 also criticised Israel&apos;s continued detention without charge or trial of two Palestinian footballers. Several former Premier League players have also signed the letter, including Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, who now plays in China. Players with QPR, Stoke, Blackburn and Ipswich are among the signatories along with footballers in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Turkey. The statement roundly condemns the Israeli assault on Gaza, describing it as &quot;yet another stain on the world&apos;s conscience&quot; and expresses &quot;solidarity with the people of Gaza who are living under siege and denied basic human dignity and freedom&quot;. It then focuses on the destruction of a football stadium which the Israeli military said had previously been used by Hamas as a rocket launching site but which at the time of the bombing was not. &quot;We are informed that on 10 November 2012 the Israeli army bombed a sports stadium in Gaza, resulting in the death of four young people playing football, Mohamed Harara and Ahmed Harara, 16 and 17 years old; Matar Rahman and Ahmed al-Dirdissawi, 18 years old. We are also informed that since February 2012 two footballers with the club al-Amari, Omar Rowis, 23, and Mohammed Nemer, 22, have been detained in Israel without charge or trial,&quot; the statement read. &quot;It is unacceptable that children are killed while they play football. Israel hosting the Uefa Under-21 European championship, in these circumstances, will be seen as a reward for actions that are contrary to sporting values.&quot; The Uefa Under-21 draw is scheduled to be held on Wednesday in Tel Aviv. But the choice of Israel for the competition is facing an increasingly strong challenge from pro-Palestinian activists who say that while the Jewish state has an equal place among footballing nations, it actively prevents the Palestinians from having one. Uefa&apos;s president, Michel Platini, has previously rejected pressure to move the competition out of Israel. Eric Cantona, formerly of Manchester United, wrote to Uefa earlier this year over the detention without trial of Palestinian footballers. &quot;Racism, human rights abuses and gross violations of international law are daily occurrences in that country,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time to end Israel&apos;s impunity and to insist on the same standards of equality, justice and respect for international law that we demand of other states.&quot; The Palestinian Football Association has long protested that it cannot operate freely because of the actions of the Israeli military. Its president, Jibril Rajoub, wrote to Platini earlier this year to say that Israel was in breach of Fifa regulations because of its treatment of Palestinian footballers. Platini was not sympathetic. &quot;We cannot hold the Israel FA responsible for the political situation in the region or for legal procedures in place in its country. You know better than anyone that it is not by punishing people and isolating them that we achieve our aims. It is through dialogue that solutions are found,&quot; he replied. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2012.

The loss at Upton Park extended Chelsea&apos;s run without a win in the Premier League to seven matches, their worst sequence since 1995, with Abramovich understood to have been infuriated by his players&apos; second-half capitulation. There are concerns that Ben\u00edtez, who remains the subject of intense hostility from the club&apos;s fans given his long-standing ties with Liverpool, has been unable to spark an immediate upturn in the side&apos;s form with Chelsea now 10 points behind Manchester United in the title race. While there is no great desire to instigate further upheaval within the coaching set-up following the abrupt dismissal of Roberto Di Matteo less than a fortnight ago, Chelsea will consider more changes to their staff if results do not improve swiftly. To that end the possible reappointment of Grant \u2013 who had briefly been considered as an alternative to Ben\u00edtez when the board deemed Di Matteo&apos;s time to be up \u2013 in an advisory role to assist the Spaniard has been discussed by the hierarchy. The Israeli&apos;s return to the club would represent further antagonising an increasingly disillusioned fanbase, though that he is under consideration reflects the chaos currently gripping the European champions. Grant, a personal friend of Abramovich and previously the club&apos;s director of football, had controversially replaced Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as manager in the autumn of 2007 and went on to steer the team to the League Cup and, most notably, Champions League finals only to lose them both. His contract was terminated in the wake of the European Cup defeat by Manchester United in Moscow on penalties, with Grant later claiming he had turned down the chance to revert to his former position as director of football. The 57-year-old has remained on good terms with Abramovich since and spent time in charge at Portsmouth, West Ham and Partizan Belgrade, but is currently available and in London having delayed a trip back to his home in Tel Aviv. While Grant has not been contacted formally over any potential involvement at Chelsea, it is understood he would be willing to take up an advisory role if the club came calling, though the specifics of any such position are as yet unclear. Ben\u00edtez brought in Xavi Valero, Paco de Miguel and Bolo Zenden on his appointment 11 days ago on a seven-month contract, though Zenden, nominally his No2, is still to secure all his Uefa coaching badges and cannot enter the technical area during games. The interim manager admitted on Saturday he &quot;cannot be 100% sure&quot; he will see out his short-term contract the 52-year-old has called for more time to make his impact felt having benefited to date from only a handful of training sessions and three winless matches in a cluttered schedule. Ben\u00edtez has confirmed there were angry words exchanged by staff and players in the dressing room after the frustrating 3-1 reverse at Upton Park but reaffirmed his belief that he can arrest the side&apos;s slump in form. Indeed, having spoken face to face with Abramovich after his first two games in charge, against Manchester City and Fulham, and again at the club&apos;s Cobham training base last week, as well as attending a board meeting last Thursday, he is confident he still benefits from the owner&apos;s immediate support. Ben\u00edtez will hope to register a first win against Nordsjaelland in Chelsea&apos;s final Champions League group game on Wednesday, though even victory over the Danes may not be enough to force passage into the knock-out phase. Should Juventus avoid defeat against Shakhtar Donetsk, then Chelsea will be consigned to the Europa League, a reality they would still be digesting as they depart for the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan immediately after Saturday&apos;s trip to Sunderland.

Among their chores are to herd cattle, journey across alligator-infested swamps and castrate a bullock. All of which is a particular challenge to Richardson, whose vegetarianism is a source of amused perplexion to the locals.

Maintaining a veneer of self-restraint that made him a respected \u2013 if feared - member of the Brighton business community isn&apos;t easy when his sons drag him into a face-off with east European pretenders to his crown.

But one year on they&apos;re all grownup. Andy, who couldn&apos;t get a canula in, is plunging veins like a natural and Priya, who had the air of a woman who&apos;d already been a doctor for 10 years, is off to dermatology.

Then it&apos;s on to making shashuka \u2013 a quintessentially Mediterranean dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato and hot pepper sauce \u2013 before heading off to pick fresh pomegranates, easily the most glamorous fruit on the planet. A fitting conclusion to his journey.

Caroline has ditched John, but he refuses to leave the house and indulges in some decadent behaviour while listening to The Archers. Gillian has problems, too, as Raff gets a police caution for beating up Paul. And what of Alan and Celia? Well, they&apos;ve obviously been busy as Celia wants to overshare the details of their love life with a reluctant Caroline, and a lack of church attendance threatens to scupper their wedding plans. HV Body Of Proof9pm, Channel 5 Is this show about a police medical examiner who is also a mum, or is it about a mum who is also a police medical examiner? This week it&apos;s tipped towards the latter as Dr Megan Hunt&apos;s private life eclipses everything else. Good news on the dating front is soured when she hears her ex is moving away and taking their daughter along. While this makes things a bit more soapy than usual, it&apos;s just as well as the case-of-the-week \u2013 a teenager found dead after a rave \u2013 isn&apos;t much of a poser.

Which, the author reflects, she might be, albeit someone proselytising on behalf of literature.

JW The Dark Ages: An Age Of Light9pm, BBC4 The word &quot;barbarian&quot;, says Waldemar Januszczak, has its roots in a Greek term for someone who spoke a foreign language, rather than a marauding pagan. It&apos;s a counter-intuitive starting point for a debunking of what we think we know about the Huns, Vandals and Goths. Each of these tribes left behind stunning works of art as they spread out across Europe and, in the case of the Vandals, north Africa. Camden resident Januszczak delights in the irony of the original Goths being &quot;colourful, inventive&quot; people rather than black-clad gloom-mongers. JW Why Poverty? The Great Land Rush10pm, BBC4 Part of BBC4&apos;s Why Poverty? season. Hugo Berkeley and Osvalde Lewat&apos;s film notes that after a period of stability, food prices spiked at the beginning of the 21st century. They look for reasons why in Mali. Mali is poor, with a wealth of agricultural land. This has attracted foreign investors, who have been buying land from beneath the feet of the 75% of its population who subsist from agriculture. A scheme to lease farmland aims to please everybody \u2013 but faces difficulties in figuring out who owns it in the first place. AM Alphas10pm, 5* US superhuman crime squad serial, now in its second season. Hoping to foil supervillain Stanton Parish&apos;s doomsday plot, Cameron and Kat respond to a telekinetic tip-off, and stumble across Mitchell (Hobbit Sean Austin), an Alpha able to store the memories of others. Can the pair get him back to base before Parish&apos;s goon gets to them? Meanwhile, Dr Rosen, the Xavier to Parish&apos;s Magneto, shows his ruthless side when a memory-wiped senator starts asking tough questions. Enjoyable, briskly paced fluff, with enough moral complexity at its core to keep things interesting. GM  Wednesday The War On Britain&apos;s Roads9pm, BBC1 More and more cyclists are taking to the roads, competing for space with four-wheeled traffic \u2013\u00a0with prickly and often perilous consequences. This documentary sees both sides of the conflict, using footage from helmet-mounted cameras now used by cyclists as documentation of their near-collisions with irresponsible drivers. We see also some of the liberties taken by red-light jumping cyclists, and hear from those involved in road rage incidents. A well-made film, if a little high on adrenaline and drama rather than information. DS The Town9pm, ITV1     The Town (ITV) Photograph: Big Talk Productions    A few years ago ITV promised to build an empire around the talents of Martin Clunes, but no one quite envisaged something as spooky as The Town, in which Clunes features as the dishevelled, often drunk mayor. Renton is the town&apos;s name, and the vibe here is decidedly unsettling: amid the calm of the semi-detached houses, there&apos;s the humming of sinister business. When an unexpected turn of events causes the not exactly un-weird Mark (Andrew Scott) to return to his hometown, he finds nothing, eerily, has really changed. A bit too stylish and odd to fit with the channel&apos;s other output, but an intriguing story, nonetheless. JR Chris Tarrant&apos;s Extreme Railways9pm, Channel 5 In this first of a new series, Chris Tarrant travels to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to experience the oft-ramshackle rail network running through the spine of the nation. Viewers not in possession of thick glasses and sturdy notebooks can rest easy: the programme delves more into the culture and history alongside each route rather than poring over, say, the benefits of broad-gauge tracks, while Tarrant remains engagingly game throughout. MJ Rome: A History Of The Eternal City9pm, BBC4 First part of Simon Sebag Montefiore&apos;s attempt to do in two episodes what took Edward Gibbon several volumes. In this instalment, he unspools the irony that Rome owes its status as a monotheistic holy city to its pre-Christian history as the habitat of a vast, unruly pantheon. As Montefiore demonstrates, these gods were consulted \u2013 and sacrificed to \u2013 on every major subject: no wonder so many Roman emperors sought to join their number.

So the old boss has to sit and watch all his loyal underlings try to impress (suck up to) the new guy. It&apos;s more a hindrance than a help that Vickers is played by Will Ferrell; he goes full-tilt in his performance, which is seldom advisable. Seeing the regulars debase themselves in front of him isn&apos;t much fun either, Jim and Pam pimping their baby&apos;s cuteness, Kevin wearing a wig. Thankfully the show is saved by Andy who is mistaken for the office buffoon and desperately has to assume that role.

Amsterdam&apos;s central station, he discovers, was built on reclaimed land. In Brussels, he makes friends by handing out praline chocolates. Portillo&apos;s odyssey ends in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, where the 1918 armistice was signed, and where, in a Foch-off gesture, Hitler later forced the French to concede defeat in 1940. JW Madeley Meets The Squatters9pm, ITV1 It is what it says it is: a documentary in which Richard Madeley sets off to talk to squatters, in the wake of the new law criminalising the squatting of residential property. It might be tempting to conclude that ITV is commissioning by plucking the names of presenters from one hat and the topic from another, but Madeley acquits himself rather well, honestly acknowledging his own wealth and (possibly not coincidental) reflexive distaste for squatting, yet giving those who do it (and those who suffer it) a compassionate hearing. AM Jamie &amp; Jimmy&apos;s Food Fight Club9pm, Channel 4 Caffeine-addled toddlers Jamie Oliver and Jimmy Doherty are out to prove that Brit cuisine is the best. So they&apos;ve decamped to a &quot;pop-up cafe&quot; in Brighton where each week they&apos;ll do battle with foreigners over a particular foodstuff (this week they take on the French at cheese-making). Well, that&apos;s the premise. In reality this is a largely formless affair; one minute Oliver and Doherty are sprinting around a town centre dressed as farm animals, the next they&apos;re challenging Alan Carr to a game of Sausage Roll Russian Roulette. Exhausting. GM The Secret Life Of Rubbish9pm, BBC4 In the 70s and 80s, the stuff we threw away didn&apos;t just reflect the times we were living in, it dictated the whole political agenda. The piles of uncollected rubbish left rotting in the streets during the &quot;winter of discontent&quot; led to refuse collection becoming the first of our public services to be sold off under Thatcher. So part two of this stealthily brilliant BBC4 doc is not just a load of rubbish, it&apos;s about privatisation and environmentalism \u2013 two concepts that weren&apos;t always in opposition, as the bloke who invented the bottle bank cheerily testifies. SJR Playhouse Presents: A Young Doctor&apos;s Notebook9pm, Sky Arts 1           Set in Russia in 1917 and based on the short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov, this might seem like a bleak prospect but far from it; starring Daniel Radcliffe as a doctor working in a small village at the start of the revolution and Jon Hamm as his older self in the Stalin era, this is very funny indeed in its bleakly provincial way, with echoes of The Irish RM and Blackadder. &quot;We have a lot of fun round here,&quot; one of Radcliffe&apos;s new colleagues promises him on arrival. &quot;Only last month I heard a very amusing anecdote.&quot; Take his word for it. DS Europe&apos;s Forgotten Desert9pm, Nat Geo Wild The Tabernas Desert in southern Spain is the only desert in Europe, with far more in common with Africa than the Costas. The ancient former seabed is the parched home to scorpions, reptiles and vegetation somehow thriving in drought. A landscape without human habitation, it is arid and mountainous, nicknamed &quot;the Badlands&quot;, and not without reason. Plants and animals have learned to cope with the scarce rainfall, which comes in the form of infrequent but dramatic deluges. Scenery such as this is a gift to photograph and document, as evidenced here. BA  Friday North Pole Ice Airport8pm, Channel 5 Fans of John Carpenter&apos;s The Thing may experience a jolt of deja-vu at the start of this documentary, in which a helicopter crew flies over the icy wastes, searching for something very particular. In fact, these Russians are looking for the perfect site on which to build, of all things, an airport, just 25 miles from the North Pole, with a runway &quot;like no other in the world&quot;. This new series follows the construction of Ice Station Barneo, and follows its prospective guests (scientists, adventurers, tourists), braving temperatures of -40 C. AJC Westminster Abbey9pm, BBC2     Ptolemy Dean in Westminster Abbey (BBC2). Photograph: BBC/Kate Scholefield    Sweeping cameras herald this new series going behind the scenes at Westminster Abbey: &quot;a flagship institution, right at the centre of public life&quot; as the Abbey&apos;s master of the choristers James O&apos;Donnell says. In this first episode, we meet the dean, the vergers and plumbers&apos; assistants responsible for the smooth running of this self-contained indoor city, approximately 1,000-years-old. If there&apos;s a beatific calmness and quiet majesty about the place, it&apos;s made abundantly clear that it takes superhuman levels of unflustered planning to keep it that way. AJC. Peter Kay\u2013 In Conversation9pm, Channel 4 Whatever you think of Peter Kay&apos;s catchphrase-y schtick, the man has a particular genius for getting the most out of a relatively slim portfolio of material. Here then is a timely bit of self-promotion for Kay&apos;s new standup DVD \u2013 itself cobbled together from the same run of shows as last year&apos;s Tour That Didn&apos;t Tour Tour release \u2013 as the Boltonian comedian chats about a career that only the churlish would deny has been hugely successful. Danny Baker, making a welcome return to our screens, asks the questions. GM Spy8.30pm, Sky1 Tim is invited to the summer ball at Marcus&apos;s school but his ongoing datelessness prompts cruel taunts from Portis and the other spies in the office. Meanwhile, Phillip is ousted from the school in Mrs Godfrey&apos;s own night of the long knives while her daughter Bernice coldly swats away the boyish advances of Chris. Mathew Baynton as Chris steals this episode when he fashions his feelings of rejection into an impressive musical missile and aims it straight at Bernice&apos;s head. Silly and brilliant. Silliant. JNR AC/DC Live At River Plate9pm, BBC4 There are few things more cringe-worthy in rock than a musician mangling the native language of the audience they&apos;re playing to, in some misplaced attempt at bonding. Brian Johnson doesn&apos;t even try. &quot;We don&apos;t speak very good Spanish,&quot; he growls at 200,000 Argentinian fans. &quot;But we speak rock&apos;n&apos;roll pretty good!&quot; He&apos;s not wrong. Recorded in Buenos Aires in 2009, there&apos;s a whole lotta classics here, from Back In Black to Highway To Hell and For Those About To Rock (We Salute You). Play it quietly while sipping a herbal infusion, just to confuse people. AJC Rattlesnake Republic9pm, Animal Planet How many ways can you catch a rattlesnake? Loads, if this documentary which follows Texas types with massive beards &apos;n&apos; bellies hunting them down for cash is anything to go by. Those rattlers love &quot;cracks, crevices and critters&quot;, and there&apos;s a price on their heads. Of course, danger lurks everywhere: lazy apprentice Dalton gets frisked by a snake while he takes a rest on a rock; showman Jackie \u2013 bitten 10 times \u2013 is reaching for the anti-venom again; and young guns Danny and Jase are dicing with death. It&apos;s like a land-locked Deadliest Catch, but more rattly.

An official in the office of the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said: &quot;Israel will continue to stand by its vital interests, even in the face of international pressure, and there will be no change in the decision that was made.&quot; Israel announced the construction of the homes after the United Nations general assembly voted to recognise the Palestinian state. The British prime minister&apos;s spokesman said Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister, had met the Israeli ambassador in London on Monday morning to complain about the new building programme, and that the Foreign Office had put out its own statement about the row. Sweden, Denmark and Spain also summoned Israeli ambassadors in protest at the plan. Downing Street played down reports that Britain might withdraw its ambassador from Israel, but refused to completely rule it out as an option. &quot;We are not proposing to do that,&quot; the spokesman said when asked about the suggestion that Britain was planning to take the extraordinary step of withdrawing its ambassador. He said: &quot;We are not proposing to do anything further at this stage&quot; \u2013 suggesting that a withdrawal had not been completely ruled out. Asked to clarify, the spokesman said: &quot;We are consulting with our international partners and discussing the situation with the Israeli government.&quot; The recall of the British ambassador would be a dramatic and unprecedented rebuke to the Israeli government, whose isolation was sharply illustrated by the overwhelming backing for the state of Palestine in New York last week. Only eight countries out of 193 rallied to Israel&apos;s side in opposing the move. Britain is furious at Israel&apos;s decision to take punitive measures in response, including the authorisation of the 3,000 new settler homes and the development of land east of Jerusalem known as E1 for construction.     Proposed E1 Israeli settlement    A Foreign Office spokesperson said on Monday: &quot;We deplore the recent Israeli government decision to build 3,000 new housing units and unfreeze development in the E1 block. This threatens the viability of the two-state solution. &quot;We have called on the Israeli government to reverse this decision. The Israeli ambassador to London, Daniel Taub, has been formally summoned to the Foreign Office this morning by the minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt. The minister set out the depth of the UK&apos;s concerns. &quot;Any decision about any other measures the UK might take will depend on the outcome of our discussions with the Israeli government and with international partners, including the US and EU.&quot; The development of E1 has been frozen for years under pressure from the US and EU. Western diplomats regard it as a &quot;game-changer&quot; as its development would close off East Jerusalem \u2013 the future capital of Palestine \u2013 from the West Bank. Britain has demanded that Israel rescind the decision. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the settlement expansion plans &quot;would represent an almost fatal blow to the remaining chances of securing a two-state solution&quot;. The EU foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, said such expansion &quot;may represent a strategic step undermining the prospects of a contiguous and viable Palestine with Jerusalem as the shared capital of both it and Israel&quot;. In France, the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said Israel&apos;s plans were a &quot;new area of colonisation&quot; and, if confirmed, would &quot;sap the necessary confidence in a resumption of talks&quot;. He said: &quot;I call on the Israeli authorities to abstain from all decision regarding this and to show clearly their willingness to restart negotiations.&quot; He summoned the Israeli ambassador to France, Yossi Gal, to express his unhappiness over the project. French media reported that London and Paris were considering joint action that would send a &quot;strong diplomatic signal&quot;. However, Paris also refused to confirm rumours that it was planning to pull out its ambassador. &quot;There are other ways of marking our disapproval,&quot; a ministry spokesperson said. France, Britain and the EU have all protested directly to the director general of the Israeli foreign affairs ministry, Rafi Barak. Other steps under consideration are sanctions against settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including tougher measures on the labelling of settlement produce exported to Europe, and the suspension of strategic dialogue meetings. The UK and other EU countries had warned Israel against taking punitive action in response to the UN vote. A statement issued by the British embassy in Tel Aviv said: &quot;The foreign secretary has consistently made it very clear that the UK would not support a strong reaction to Thursday&apos;s UNGA resolution that undermined the prospects for negotiations and efforts to build a strong foundation for the peace process. The recent Israeli government decision to build 3,000 new housing units threatens the two-state solution and makes progress through negotiations harder to achieve. We have called on the Israeli government to reconsider.&quot; The Israeli cabinet unanimously rejected the UN vote at its weekly meeting on Sunday. It described the West Bank as &quot;disputed territory&quot; over which the Jewish people had &quot;a natural right&quot;. Israel&apos;s Channel 2 reported that Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama&apos;s former chief of staff, had described the behaviour of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, as &quot;unfathomable&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-12-03T13:12:00Z", "title": "Israel stands by settlements plan despite growing diplomatic crisis", "sentences": ["A statement issued by the British embassy in Tel Aviv said: &quot;The foreign secretary has consistently made it very clear that the UK would not support a strong reaction to Thursday&apos;s UNGA resolution that undermined the prospects for negotiations and efforts to build a strong foundation for the peace process."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/03/uk-may-recall-israel-ambassador-settlement"}, {"tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "After winning the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow and the Rubinstein Piano competition in Tel Aviv last year, Daniil Trifonov made his recital debut in London in March. If that appearance left a mixed impression, his return for the Southbank Centre&apos;s International Piano Series was almost totally positive. At 21, Trifonov is by no means the finished article, but he is an utterly thrilling prospect; technically fearless and with a musical temperament to match, he&apos;s willing to take risks, and most of them come off. Trifonov had chosen a programme to suit his strengths \u2013 sonatas by Scriabin and Liszt, followed by Chopin&apos;s 24 Preludes Op 28. If the Scriabin, the Second Sonata in G sharp Minor Op 19, showed his ability to spin weightless lines of filigree as the music&apos;s melodic outlines dissolved into decoration, the Liszt B minor Sonata was conceived on the boldest, most dramatic terms. Tempi were extreme. Trifonov plunged ferociously into the opening section and never allowed his dramatic grip to slacken. That didn&apos;t preclude moments of great beauty \u2013 some of the simplest scalic ideas in the slow section had a wonderfully crystalline purity \u2013 but it was drive that mattered most in the performance, even though the climaxes in the final fugue were pressed so hard the sound became thin and wiry. The Chopin Preludes had the same contrasting combination of brilliance and ravishment, sharply focused vignettes contrasted with the panache of a born showman. Trifonov&apos;s articulation in some of the faster numbers was breathtaking, but it was also superbly controlled, just as his ability to float the simplest melody showed his awareness of when the music could be left to speak for itself. The first two encores were sharply contrasted, too: a delicate Medtner Fairy Tale was followed by Guido Agosti&apos;s transcription of the Infernal Dance from Stravinsky&apos;s Firebird, ferociously, swaggeringly delivered. \u2022 What have you been to see lately?

There will be no concession on an inch of the land,&quot; he told the crowd on his first visit to Gaza. &quot;We will never recognise the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation and therefore there is no legitimacy for Israel, no matter how long it will take.&quot; The supporters \u2013 many of them wearing Hamas green headbands and carrying Hamas flags \u2013 packed the open-air venue in rain and strong winds to celebrate the Islamist organisation&apos;s 25th anniversary and what it regards as a victory in last month&apos;s eight-day war with Israel. Among the crowd, which Hamas officials estimated at half a million, were some Fatah supporters, waving their faction&apos;s yellow flag. It was one of increasing signs in recent weeks that reconciliation between the two rival factions could become a more realistic prospect in the coming months. Patriotic songs forecasting the liberation of the whole land of Palestine blared from huge speakers, as children, some dressed in military garb, brandished plastic guns and toy rockets. Accompanied by Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza&apos;s de facto prime minister, Meshaal stepped through a giant model of a Hamas missile on to the stage, which took the form of a map of historic Palestine. Dressed in a dark coat and draped in a Hamas scarf, he repeatedly raised his hands in acknowledgement of the crowd&apos;s cheers. The Hamas leader, on Palestinian soil for the first time in four decades, also pledged to free thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, hinting that militants may attempt to kidnap Israeli soldiers to use as bargaining chips. &quot;We will not rest until we liberate the prisoners. The way we freed some of the prisoners in the past is the way we will use to free the remaining prisoners,&quot; Meshaal said to cheers. Hamas held Gilad Shalit, a young Israeli conscript, for more than five years before releasing him in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in October 2011. Meshaal congratulated fighters from Hamas and other armed groups who targeted long-range missiles at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, saying: &quot;We don&apos;t fight Jews because they are Jews. We fight the Zionists because they are conquerors and we will continue to fight anyone who takes our land and our holy places \u2026 We will free Jerusalem inch by inch, stone by stone.&quot; The right of return for Palestinian refugees &quot;is sacred to us and we will not forfeit it&quot;, he said. In a list of towns which refugees would reclaim, he included Safed, birthplace of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in a barbed reference to hints in a recent interview that Abbas was ready to compromise on this emotive issue. The rally was opened by a masked representative of Hamas&apos;s military wing, the Izzudin al-Qassam Brigades, who told the crowd: &quot;We will cut the hand that extends in aggression against our people and leaders.&quot; Meshaal&apos;s speech, delivered from behind a bank of white flowers, began five hours after the start of the event. Hamas is in buoyant mood following last month&apos;s war with Israel, in which more than 160 Palestinians were killed and around 1,000 injured. Six Israelis also died in the conflict. The hardline faction, which has ruled Gaza since June 2007 after winning elections 17 months earlier, claims it won a victory despite the destruction of much of its arsenal of weapons, training facilities and offices. Following a ceasefire deal, Meshaal told a press conference in Cairo: &quot;We have come out of this battle with our heads held high.&quot; Hamas feels that the conflict brought it significant international legitimacy, with a stream of regional political figures heading to Gaza to show solidarity with Palestinians under bombardment. Officials in Gaza said that around 1,000 visitors from abroad had travelled to the coastal enclave for Saturday&apos;s celebration, including delegations from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, Bahrain and Malaysia, in what was claimed as a further sign of international acceptance. Some in the crowd spoke of their desire for Palestinian unity. Wheelchair user Taghreed Abu Hatab, 40, said: &quot;However hard it was for me to come, I made it. I was waiting for this day for a long time because it represents unity to us. I&apos;m not Hamas, but we are all brothers, and on this day we are begging for unity.&quot; But Ibraheem Lutfy, 32, resented Hamas&apos;s claim of victory in the recent conflict. &quot;It&apos;s not Hamas only that was resisting \u2013 all the factions were there,&quot; he said. &quot;But Hamas wants to own the victory as if it was the only one resisting.&quot; He was not impressed by Meshaal&apos;s presence: &quot;I never felt he did something special to me.&quot; On passing through the border with Egypt on Friday, the exiled Hamas leader kissed the ground and wept. Meshaal, 56, was born in the West Bank but left with his family at the age of 11 following the 1967 six-day war, in which Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. After surviving an Israeli attempt to assassinate him in 1997, he became leader of Hamas following the death of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in 2004. Until the beginning of this year, Meshaal&apos;s headquarters-in-exile was in Damascus. After refusing to support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Meshaal now divides his time between Cairo and Doha. He is expected to leave Gaza on Sunday. The celebration was brought forward by a few days to hold it on the anniversary of the start of the first Palestinian intifada \u2013 uprising \u2013 in 1997. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 9 December 2012 to correct a mistranslation in a quote by Meshaal.", "publicationDate": "2012-12-08T17:49:03Z", "title": "Hamas leader vows not to yield 'an inch of Palestine' to Israel", "sentences": ["Meshaal congratulated fighters from Hamas and other armed groups who targeted long-range missiles at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, saying: &quot;We don&apos;t fight Jews because they are Jews."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/08/hamas-gaza-palestine-khaled-meshaal-israel"}, {"tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "United Nations"], "article": "9 November It was inevitable that at some point Jewish settlements in the West Bank would endanger even the trees. This was the thought I had as I was driven through the northern part of the West Bank on a field trip organised by Oxfam, which is working with Palestinian NGOs to help local cooperatives improve their agricultural practices and open up local and international markets to them. The villagers told us that tens of thousands of olive trees have been uprooted to make way for the construction of the Israeli separation barrier. By the time the barrier is finished, in a few more years, one million trees will be caught in the no-go area between it and the 1967 armistice line. On the way back our driver tells me he worked for a number of years for the Israeli bus company, Egged. &quot;Most of these buses you see going to the settlements travel with very few passengers. They charge little so that what they make can hardly cover the cost of the fuel they consume.&quot; While the life of Palestinian villagers is made difficult, that of the settlers is heavily subsidised to encourage more Israelis to settle. The driver then tells me: &quot;Last week there was going to be a war on Gaza but it was averted at the last minute.&quot; I asked him how he knew this. He said: &quot;An urgent message came asking me to drive immediately to Gaza and bring back all of Oxfam&apos;s international staff. When I got there I found that all internationals were being evacuated. But it wasn&apos;t possible because Hamas closed its side of the border and wouldn&apos;t let them out.&quot; 19 November Today I am in far away Edinburgh, and was determined to give myself a break from the rigours of life under occupation only to end up being bombarded with bad news about yet another Israeli invasion of Gaza. This has happened a number of times before and makes me nervous about going\u00a0away. I just received an email from Eyad Sarraj, a psychiatrist who lives in Gaza city. He writes: &quot;The worst enemy of Zionism is peace. This is why Israel killed Jabari, the Qassam leader who agreed and installed the latest truce three days ago \u2026&quot; This is how he ends his message: &quot;As I finish writing the whole neighborhood is shaken with successive Israeli bombing. It is 3 a.m. There are rumours about a new truce, but remember, Israel kills peacemakers, with love, Eyad.&quot; My most distressing thought is that Israeli weapons are being tried out on our people. This will boost sales for the Israeli armaments industry enabling Israel to develop more weapons that will need to be tried out in future wars. When will Israel discover that peace can be lucrative too? 21 November I arrive in London and go to see the play, Arab Nights. The note from the director, Poppy Burton-Morgan, invites viewers to &quot;a world of djinnis and demonstrations, of romance and revolutions&quot;. I am one of six writers from the Arab world invited to write a tale using the vehicle of the Arabian Nights to reflect on what is currently going on across the Middle East. The one I enjoy most is by the Lebanese artist, Tania Khoury, &quot;Tale of the Dictator&apos;s Wife&quot;, featuring Asma Assad and her obsession with expensive shoes. She is played by Dina Mousawi, who goes on ordering one expensive pair after another on the internet by punching with her long legs the images projected over the wall until the words &quot;account blocked&quot; appear on the screen. In my tale, &quot;The Two Djinnis and the Wall&quot;, I let loose my imagination and have a Palestinian hiker who has been stopped at an Israeli checkpoint tell of his dreams of a new reality in the region to a female Israeli soldier detaining him while his backpack is being searched. She had claimed she did not understand Arabic, but when he finishes she asks: &quot;Will I ever be able to travel to the places you speak about? My family comes from Aleppo.&quot; I hope writers can serve the cause of peace by provoking people&apos;s yearning for it. Aren&apos;t new realities created by first imagining them, making what is possible in art thinkable in life? 26 November Back from London yesterday afternoon. Fortunately during my absence some good rain has fallen. The garden looks refreshed. The bougainvillea is still in bloom. To have survived six months of utter drought, what resilience! And with just a bit of water it and the other shrubs revive and come back to life. 29 November The celebrations began long before the vote was taken at the UN in favour of the Palestinian Authority&apos;s new status as a non-member observer state. Schools were dismissed early and government departments closed hours ahead of the usual 3pm. By late morning last Thursday, people in every town and city of the West Bank were raising Palestinian flags and making celebratory speeches. 30 November I just read that the Palestinian minister of communications will be seeking full membership for Palestine with the Universal Postal Union. If successful this might mean that we might finally get a post code. We&apos;ll no longer need to write 0000 where a post code is required and will stop being the zero people four times over, all thanks to the UN vote. I went for a walk in the afternoon. Yellow signs with black writing have been pasted on billboards by the Fatah Youth movement. They read: &quot;Warning! This is illegally occupied land, State of Palestine, the occupier must leave immediately.&quot; In the evening a post-show discussion of a locally produced play, The Station, reveals that the young are strongly divided. Some want the Palestinian Authority to be dissolved, the occupation brought back and resistance resumed. Some think the way of Hamas is the only right one and most lament how most people are so restrained by their private debts to the banks that they will not get involved in public issues. At a reading in Jerusalem of my book, Occupation Diaries, my old friend, David Kretzmer, who has written a lot about the Israeli High Court, is in the audience. Afterwards he tells me he does not agree with me that the court is to be blamed for the failure to de-legitimise the settlement project. Had they tried this the Israeli government would have restricted their jurisdiction to hear cases against the settlements. But he does agree with me that the settlers now are so powerful they practically control the government. This has been proved by Netanyahu&apos;s insistence on going ahead with his plans to complete the encirclement of Arab East Jerusalem by building the E1 settlement despite strong opposition by Israel&apos;s allies including the US. Perhaps our occupiers have not seen yet the sign posted by the Fatah Youth Movement. 11 December Well, Israel just invaded the &quot;capital&quot; of our new state. I was awakened last night by the sound of gunshots. It turned out that the Israeli army has invaded Ramallah (recognised under the Oslo Accords as Area A with full Palestinian jurisdiction and so out of bounds for Israeli soldiers). Israel it seems is bent on continuing to provoke the Palestinians in the West Bank as it is doing in Gaza, where the Israeli army is making almost daily incursions despite the truce. I wonder whether my friend Hani will hear this news and change his mind about coming on his long awaited Christmas visit. For months he&apos;s been fretting over the reception he would receive at the Tel Aviv airport, whether he will be allowed in or deported even though he now holds a US passport. His family are Palestinian refugees from 1948. He was born in Jerusalem and lived as an adult in the United States. He&apos;s never been involved in politics. There is nothing Israel can hold against him except that he&apos;s a Palestinian. His last email was not encouraging. He writes: &quot;A friend from London gave me an idea of the type of questions I will be repeatedly asked. I am not at all sure I can withstand that.&quot; Perhaps now that Palestine has been recognised by the UN we should place on hold the right of return and work instead on securing from Israel the right of Palestinians just to visit their newly recognised state.", "publicationDate": "2012-12-14T10:00:02Z", "title": "Palestine: Diary of a historic month", "sentences": ["For months he&apos;s been fretting over the reception he would receive at the Tel Aviv airport, whether he will be allowed in or deported even though he now holds a US passport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/14/palestine-diary-state-un-resolution-month"}, {"tags": ["Martin Parr", "Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Jillian Edelstein I grew up in South Africa. Christmas Day was generally spent on the beach, so I associate this time of year with heat. For me, Christmas is a sunny scene like this. In December 2003, I went to a family reunion in Cape Town. This was taken during that particularly memorable Christmas, when I learned of a great aunt I didn&apos;t know existed, and acquired an extraordinary photograph of some of my female relatives, who were in a band in South Africa during the second world war. That sparked a giant project over the next few years. I usually balk at taking all the photographs at family gatherings, and will head off in the other direction if it&apos;s suggested. But in this case, I had agreed to take a group shot of everyone. Immediately afterwards, my son, who was nine at the time, did this wonderfully spontaneous thing of diving into the pool in a Santa hat. Kids are so oblivious to the bigger picture; it was such an offbeat and childish thing for him to do. Photographers often send out one of their shots as a Christmas card. One year, I used a studio portrait of Jane Horrocks wrapped in silver tinsel with a pine-cone garland on her head. But I always appreciate this kind of moment more, possibly because I began my career in reportage; there is a realism about it that is beautiful. Also hugely significant is the fact that my son was born on Christmas Day: to us, he is Christmas. Jillian Edelstein has won many awards for her portrait photography, and recently collaborated with the National Portrait Gallery on their Road to 2012 exhibition. She documented the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa between 1996 and 2002, publishing the photographs in her book Truth and Lies. Sean Smith     Sean Smith's shot of rough sleeper Robert    Just before Christmas in 1993, Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington and I worked on a story together about homelessness. At the time, the Strand in London was the place where many rough sleepers went, so we headed there. We didn&apos;t want to just give someone a fiver and take a photo, so we spent a while going up and down, looking at who was there. During the course of the night, a lot of people left, maybe to go to a shelter or to Cardboard City at Waterloo station. But this guy, Robert, was sleeping on the pavement. He had recently come down from Nottinghamshire and had a pretty tough story about why he had ended up sleeping rough. After taking some pictures, including this one, our plan was to come back early in the morning and take more when he woke up. He was fine about talking to us and didn&apos;t want any money, so we thought the best thing we could do was take him for a meal. We trooped in to Salieri, a nearby tourist restaurant. The waiters looked at us suspiciously because Robert had to bring his sleeping bag and blankets with him. But they gave us a table, and we had a good meal, with the wine flowing freely. Afterwards we left him on the pavement. What we hadn&apos;t thought about is that alcohol is great for warming you up if you are cold and moving into warmth. But if you stay in the cold, it makes you even colder. When we got back in the morning, he seemed freezing and as if he wasn&apos;t breathing. For an awful moment we thought, for all our good intentions, we had given him hypothermia. Luckily he came to and was absolutely fine. We took some more pictures, then went our separate ways. I don&apos;t know where Robert is now, but I was completely confident that things would work out for him. I just wanted him to remember the night these guys from the Guardian took him for dinner. It was the sort of thing you hoped would happen if you were ever in that position. Sean Smith is a Guardian photographer and film-maker.

Thomas Ball     Thomas Ball's shot of Piccadilly Circus at dusk    This was taken in Piccadilly Circus a few\u00a0days before Christmas last year. I\u00a0had\u00a0been commissioned by the French magazine GEO to shoot some\u00a0iconic London scenes for a special issue they were putting together in the runup to the Olympics. It was due to be published in March, so\u00a0they didn&apos;t want it to look like Christmas \u2013 and I was surrounded by\u00a0decorations and lights. So I started out the day very worried: this was a scene that had been\u00a0shot millions of times before, and\u00a0I was working\u00a0at\u00a0dusk with exposures ranging from a second to\u00a0several minutes, while massive advertising hoardings blasted out\u00a0a constant stream of Christmas messages. There was the roar of traffic,\u00a0a cacophony of Christmas tracks\u00a0blasting out of the\u00a0shops, tinsel\u00a0in the windows. I\u00a0had very\u00a0little time and only 20 sheets of film to get it\u00a0right. This exposure was around the length of a traffic-light interval: you can see the people waiting for the green man. I was working with my large format camera, a dark cloth over my head, and started to attract a lot of attention. At first\u00a0it was impossible, but then the stress started to dissipate: I was enjoying watching the sun go down on\u00a0a beautiful winter&apos;s day, and I had some great chats with Londoners, who\u00a0were intrigued as to\u00a0what I was doing, and with tourists, who wanted directions. The streets of London can seem impersonal, busy, unfriendly: I\u00a0was reminded that, if you\u00a0stop and stand around long enough, you can end up having some amazing encounters with complete strangers. I went from feeling very unfestive, on\u00a0a\u00a0mission to prove that it wasn&apos;t Christmas, to having a great day shooting. I succumbed to the Christmas atmosphere, and walked home looking forward to the\u00a0whole thing. GEO ran this shot a few\u00a0months later; they cropped out the &quot;Season&apos;s&quot; on the Coca-Cola hoarding.

Tom Hunter     Tom Hunter's shot of a Hackney snowman    It&apos;s amazing when the snow comes in\u00a0London. The sound of the city completely transforms: it&apos;s deadened and silenced by this huge blanket. This is the first snowman built by both my children. We had just moved into a new house in Hackney, and got to know our neighbours that day. Everyone brought out flasks of coffee and tea, and the children were having snowball fights. It was like going back a hundred years: no cars on the roads, everyone talking, everyone playing. Suddenly you stop thinking about going beyond the end of the street, because you physically can&apos;t, and start thinking about the immediate area you live in. You&apos;re part of a moment. We built this thinking we couldn&apos;t make a real snowman: there didn&apos;t seem\u00a0to be enough snow when we started, and the children weren&apos;t well versed in the art \u2013 the rolling out and heaping up into three balls. But suddenly the snow got heavier, and we gave it arms and legs. The only traditional thing it ended up with was the carrot for its nose. It&apos;s a comedy snowman, really. He&apos;s like a bad dad dancer, with his arms in the air and those trodden-on glasses. Or he could have just fallen over, as a drunk Hackney snowman might. This image shows the magic of flash photography, which captured the individual snowflakes so they look like fairies. Each unique pattern is in focus, and you can almost feel them scattering around the snowman, like a dance he might want to join in. It was a magic moment for my children, this snowman reaching his arms out to them. It was the first snow my son had ever seen. He was crying and freezing most of the day; my daughter, who is older, saw the magic and the dancing.

Elinor Carucci     Elinor Carucci's shot of her mother    This is a shot of my mother driving me in the rain in Jerusalem, in 2000. I was 29, but there was something about sitting in the car with her that was very intense, and reminded me of being driven to piano lessons as a child. She had high expectations: I knew I had to excel, to prepare mentally \u2013 she was very loving, but there was always a tension when we got in the car. That childhood memory came back to me, and the rain made it more intense \u2013 the two of us alone in the car. She is wearing an old coat; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s real fur. She&apos;s always very put together \u2013 full makeup, hair done \u2013 and I&apos;m so not. She&apos;s visiting me now in New York, and even though I&apos;m 41 with two kids she worries about my looks. She&apos;ll say: &quot;I know it&apos;s your choice, it&apos;s your hair, but why don&apos;t you take better care of yourself, go to the salon?&quot; It&apos;s comforting that she worries. Winter in Jerusalem, where I grew up, can be very harsh: it gets cold, and it can snow. It means that Jerusalem people are more homey, as well as proud of their resilience to the weather. New York is a bit the same. I visit my mother in Tel Aviv every summer, so this picture brings back a lot of memories: I don&apos;t really get to see Israel in the winter any more. We just celebrated Hanukkah in New York; we make sure we sing all the songs. My children are fluent in Hebrew, but I do feel the gap between how I was raised, surrounded by Jewish culture, and here, where I have to make an effort. My daughter went to decorate the Christmas tree at her friend&apos;s house, and she may have enjoyed that more. My mother was the first person I ever photographed, and for me photography is about my mum. I feel a bit dead if I don&apos;t photograph her: she is so open and generous; she&apos;d never tell me to put the camera down. Yes, this image was about tension and fearing those piano lessons, knowing that I hadn&apos;t practised enough\u00a0and that she&apos;d be upset. But it&apos;s\u00a0OK to talk about those things now: sometimes\u00a0pictures tell us more than we tell\u00a0ourselves. Elinor Carucci&apos;s work has been shown at the Gagosian and Photographers&apos; galleries in London, and at MoMA in New York. She has published two books, Closer and Diary of a Dancer; she is contributing to a 2013 group show about motherhood at the Photographers Gallery in London. Martin Parr     Martin Parr's shot of a Moscow office party. Photograph: Magnum    A year ago I photographed a whole lot of company Christmas parties in Moscow. December is a great shooting month because of the party season. It was an opportunity to see some of Russian high society and watch them enjoying themselves \u2013 which they do very effectively. I went to a lot of parties. Some were small, and some were more upmarket. One was very strange: it was a surprise party where the whole staff was ambushed and taken off to Stalin&apos;s bunker. This was taken at the biggest Christmas party I have ever seen in my life: there were 1,000 people. It was in a hangar of a place, and it was for M Video \u2013 a Russian electronics chain store in Russia. After a sit-down meal, a really well-known Russian band who immediately fired people up came on. It&apos;s the dancing that is so good in this picture. I have been photographing people dancing for 20 or 30 years now, and I think I will eventually do a book of dancing photos. I need to accumulate another decade&apos;s work; then I can retire from the dancefloor and publish. Over the years I have perfected the art of dancing and photographing at the same time: it&apos;s a great double act. If you&apos;re dancing, you are joining in. If you stand there rigid, you are not in the flow of things. Everyone was on the floor having a great time, and these women were more enthusiastic than anyone else: they were going hell for leather. It required digital skills: the great trick here was to balance the ambient light \u2013 which on a dancefloor is often very little \u2013 with the light from the flash so you don&apos;t kill the atmosphere. I took dozens of shots, but this one captured the moment. Often, you need to exaggerate to make a good picture, but the reality was even more over-the-top than the photograph; you cannot over-estimate the energy of these dancers.

He lives in Bristol. Jane and Louise Wilson     Jane and Louise Wilson's shot of Zahi    Louise Wilson: This was taken with an iPhone during the Yayoi Kusama exhibition at Tate Modern. It&apos;s her 2000 installation called I&apos;m Here, But Nothing \u2013 a room full of ultraviolet light and multi-coloured polka dots. It&apos;s a very magical space. Zahi, Jane&apos;s five-year-old son, just loved that room and I thought it would be great to get a picture of him. He loves colour. A few people were trying to take pictures but they were using flash, which was blowing out the ultraviolet impact. Jane Wilson: It works because Lou managed to capture both the installation and Zahi&apos;s lit profile. She got him standing in front of the video monitor, and used the glow to light his face. It took a little while to set up as he needed to be standing at a certain distance, and it needed to not show the monitor. We both love this image because it shows a complete immersion in the installation, something we try to do in our own work. Louise: He&apos;s quite wrapped up, and they could be a series of twinkling Christmas lights. I take lots of photographs with my iPhone \u2013 lots of him, definitely. I like the way the picture gives a sense of interaction with art. Given the Ebacc situation [Michael Gove&apos;s project to exclude art, drama, music and design from the core curriculum], I think it&apos;s incredibly important to get that level of engagement with art at a young age. I\u00a0think there&apos;s something about Zahi&apos;s raptness that we could learn a lot from. Jane and Louise Wilson were nominated for the Turner prize in 1999.

In practice, however, Paulinho has a taste for the net. To the point where he ended up as Corinthians top scorer in the 2012 Brazilian league, those seven goals among 12 he scored in all competitions this year. His long-range efforts could remind English fans of vintage Frank Lampard and perhaps it is no surprise that even before putting on an efficient display against Chelsea in the final of Fifa&apos;s World Club Cup, Paulinho was already a January transfer target for the English club. Fernando Duarte 99: Diego Forl\u00e1n, Internacional, Uruguay; age 33; forward The striker became the most capped Uruguayan of all time at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica and is also the country&apos;s record scorer. That seemed implausible when he left Manchester United in 2004, disheartened after two and a half largely fruitless seasons. But he was a remarkable success at Villarreal, scoring 54 goals in 106 league games and took the club, which had not played in Europe until 2002, to the Champions League semi-finals, in 2006. Won the Uefa Cup with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid two years later and was voted player of the tournament at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Now playing in the Brazilian top flight. Marcus Christenson 98: Javi Mart\u00ednez, Bayern Munich, Spain; age 24; defender/midfielder It is a measure of how desperately Bayern Munich wanted the Spanish defender/midfielder from Athletic Bilbao in the summer that the club president, Uli Hoeness, admitted afterwards they had paid &quot;\u20ac10m or \u20ac15m too much&quot; for him. In the end Bayern stumped up the buy-out clause of \u20ac40m for him which, after all, is quite a lot for a water carrier. In fairness to Mart\u00ednez, he probably has too much skill to be called a water carrier. &quot;His task is to prevent the opposition from scoring,&quot; Hoeness said. Has an edge to him and admitted in May that he might have called Cristiano Ronaldo a &quot;son of a bitch&quot; after a match. Marcus Christenson 97: Marek Hamsik, Napoli, Slovakia; age 25; midfielder Neither a true forward nor a playmaker in the classic sense, Hamsik&apos;s precise role for Napoli can be as tricky to pin down as the player himself is on the pitch. Explosive and \u2013 like his team \u2013 ruthlessly direct, his ceaseless running from deep positions make him a handful for defenders as well as a constant goalscoring threat. He has reached double figures every season since joining Napoli in 2007 and is well on the way to doing so again \u2013 his form helping to sustain the Partenopei as Scudetto contenders despite the summer departure of the Argentinian striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to Paris Saint-Germain. Paolo Bandini 96: Pepe, Real Madrid, Portugal; age 29; defender Pepe has a bit of a reputation. The Portugal international was banned for 10 games after kicking a prostrate player in the back and punching another in the face, he was caught treading on Leo Messi&apos;s hand and he has a habit of not so much trying to clear the ball as to boot it until it bursts. Intimidation is very much part of his armoury; dark arts too. Pepe is a dog with a bad name. But what is often forgotten is that he is also an impressive centre-back: competitive, swift and strong. It is he, not Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the longest unbeaten run in a Real Madrid shirt. He moved to Spain from Porto in 2007 and has been a fixture since. Sid Lowe 95: Wesley Sneijder, Internazionale, Holland; age 28; midfielder A treble winner with Internazionale in 2010, he has been held back this season by a contract dispute with the Italian club. Inter are trying to renegotiate his basic \u20ac6m salary down to \u20ac4m and the Dutchman could be on his way out of Milan in January. An intelligent player with stunning free-kicks, he did all he could to lift an unruly Holland side at Euro 2012 but the midfielder ended up hitting out at the &quot;pathetic egos&quot; in the squad as the Oranje crashed out in the first round. Capped 90 times by Holland. Convinced by his wife Yolanthe Sneijder-Cabau to convert to Catholicism in 2010. Marcus Christenson 94: Shinji Kagawa, Manchester United, Japan; age 23; midfielder It has not been a straightforward rise to the top for the attacking midfielder who clinched a move to Borussia Dortmund from Japan in 2010 for a paltry \u20ac350,000. Initially, the 21-year-old struggled with German cuisine but admitted the girls of Dortmund &quot;were beautiful&quot;. The coach, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, said that Kagawa needed to get &quot;20% stronger&quot; to succeed in the Bundesliga so the Japanese worked on his body strength. By the time Dortmund won their second consecutive title, in 2012, Kagawa was integral, scoring 13 goals in 31 league games. &quot;We didn&apos;t want him to leave,&quot; said Klopp. &quot;But he had made up his mind.&quot; Marcus Christenson 93: Samir Nasri, Manchester City, France; age 25; midfielder/forward &quot;Great expectations&quot; was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s definition of what lay in store at Arsenal for the rough diamond signed from his boyhood club, where he was known as le Petit Prince de Marseille. Nasri was burdened with comparisons to Zinedine Zidane even before he made his professional debut, when he won the Euro Under-17s. There were periods for Marseille and Arsenal when he was inspirational, which is what alerted Manchester City to make him a big-money target. Although he has won a Premier League title, living up to the boyhood hype remains a challenge. Amy Lawrence 92: Hatem Ben Arfa, Newcastle United, France; age 23; midfielder/forward He is a cult hero for supporters and a challenge for managers and Ben Arfa&apos;s mercurial style is able to tease and test in all sorts of ways. Discipline may not be high on his list of attributes but he has always possessed enough ability to compensate. A maverick talent in his youth, where he was educated at the Clairfontaine academy, he won titles with Lyon and Marseille before taking his twinkling feet to Newcastle. A representative for France at every age level and now the holder of 13 senior caps, he recovered from a broken leg to shine last season. On his day he can be a game-changer and the fans adore him for it. Amy Lawrence 91: Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Tottenham Hotspur, Belgium; age 25; midfielder  Tottenham&apos;s manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, reckons the fact that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 played in every position in midfield and attack while at previous clubs explains why he has such a refined understanding of the game now. Villas-Boas paid \u00a315m to bring the Belgian from Fulham and the signs are that he could prove a bargain, as Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is emerging as one of the most complete midfielders in the Premier League, boasting strength, tenacity, creative passing, tricky dribbling and dangerous shooting. A firm fixture at international level for a Belgian side of which much is hoped for the future. Paul Doyle 90: Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Shakhtar Donetsk, Armenia; age 23; midfielder/forward Shakhtar&apos;s player of the year last season. This season, he&apos;s got even better. Shakhtar had tended to field Brazilians in creative positions and eastern Europeans at the back but Mkhitaryan has broken that trend, playmaking from an advanced central position and scoring hatfuls of goals. His time spent operating deep last season has enhanced his tactical understanding and Mircea Lucescu, Shakhtar&apos;s coach, has hailed his work rate in closing down attacks. Mkhitaryan was seven when his father, an Armenia international, died from a brain haemorrhage; he is already, even at 23, accepted as the greatest Armenian player since the break-up of the USSR. Jonathan Wilson 89: Javier Pastore, Paris St-Germain Argentina; age 23; midfielder He is nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; (the Skinny One) and Paris Saint-German think he is worth more than his weight in gold. The French club paid about \u00a335m to buy him in 2011 from Palermo, where his playmaking made him one of the world&apos;s most exciting prospects. After a sparkling start to his Parisian career, the 23-year-old&apos;s form and confidence dipped and quibbles arose about a perceived lack of application. Recent signs, however, suggest the blip has passed, as the Argentinian has combined inventively with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi. Paul Doyle 88: Leonardo Bonucci, Juventus, Italy; age 25, defender Along with Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli, Bonucci forms the defensive underpinning of Antonio Conte&apos;s excellent Juventus team. Bonucci&apos;s failure to make an impact at Internazionale, his first senior club, led to a season with Bari, where his performances won him a place in Italy&apos;s 2010 World Cup squad. Tall and mobile, his move to Juventus came that summer and this year he played alongside Chiellini and Barzagli in all but one of Italy&apos;s matches as they progressed to the Euro 2012 final. Richard Williams 87: Kwadwo Asamoah, Juventus, Ghana; age 24, midfielder The perfect modern footballer: fit, strong, quick, versatile, modest, hard-working and clean living. Every squad would be happy to have an Asamoah in their ranks. Juventus are delighted with his many qualities and he is regarded as one of the best signings they have made in the post-Calciopoli era. Having come to Europe via Bellinzona in Switzerland, Asamoah has seized the opportunity since moving to Italy. Antonio Conte reinvented him as a marauding wide man, where his energy and agility enabled him to be effective in defensive and offensive duties \u2013 and he provides a string of assists and the odd goal too. As Claudio Marchisio says: &quot;He&apos;s got great physical and technical qualities \u2013 everything needed to be a success at Juventus.&quot; Amy Lawrence 86: John Terry, Chelsea, England; age 32; defender  Easy to dislike but impossible to dismiss, Terry remains a defender of the highest class. Chelsea may have won the European Cup without him on the pitch, but his presence made itself felt as the team fought their way to victory on Bayern Munich&apos;s home turf. The gesture of changing first into his training gear and then into a match strip may have triggered an avalanche of mockery, but it spoke of the spirit of the club&apos;s old guard, who girded themselves for the battle that would finally bring Roman Abramovich the trophy of his dreams. And whenever David Luiz or Gary Cahill play alongside the club captain, each man looks twice the player he appears to be in Terry&apos;s absence. He was also one of England&apos;s best players at Euro 2012, the elder statesman of the team together with Steven Gerrard. Richard Williams 85: Emmanuel Mayuka, Southampton Zambia; age 22; forward A quiet start for Southampton notwithstanding, he is a promising young player who also symbolises the rebirth of the Zambian national team. Mayuka capped the country&apos;s title-winning campaign at the last Africa Cup of Nations with the tournament&apos;s Golden Boot and played all 120 minutes of their win over Ivory Coast in the final, scoring his penalty in the shootout. Leaving Africa first for a spell at Maccabi Tel Aviv, where Porto were rumoured to be interested in signing him, the Zambian earned his move to England with solid displays for Swiss side Young Boys and had reportedly been tracked by Queens Park Rangers. He joined the Saints instead and, with more experience, could prove to be a bargain in a few years&apos; time. Fernando Duarte 84: Darijo Srna, Shakhtar Donetsk, Croatia; age 30; defender Srna runs up and down. A lot. His engine is prodigious. He attacks with gusto, yet rarely gets caught out of position. He can tackle and harry. He defends. He can pass and cross. His set-piece delivery is probably the most consistently dangerous of anybody in the world. As an all-rounder, he is the best right-sided player on the planet. Yet the world&apos;s blind spot to eastern Europe means his consistent excellence goes largely unacknowledged. He&apos;s also overcome early prejudice over his Muslim heritage to be a fine captain. And the story of the coincidences that led to his father being reunited with his elder brother after they were orphaned in the second world war is the stuff of a Hollywood epic. Darijo is the happy ending. Jonathan Wilson 83: Hulk, Zenit St Petersburg, Brazil; age 26; forward The Brazilian forward with the brilliant name and a suspect temper (no, we are not making it up), scored 57 goals in 91 games for Porto until last summer, when Chelsea were preparing a \u00a338m bid to lure him to Stamford Bridge and the Premier League. In the end, Zenit St Petersburg spent about \u00a340m on him, only for the Brazilian to fall out with the manager Luciano Spalletti and threaten to quit the club after being substituted. However, Fifa rules that prevent players from competing for more than two clubs in a season mean Hulk must stay in Russia until at least next summer. He has six goals in 18 caps for Brazil. Was once banned for four months after a tunnel brawl. Nickname allegedly acquired from his father, who was a fan of The Incredible Hulk. Marcus Christenson 82: Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Montpellier, France; age 23; defender Born in the Central African Republic, Yanga-Mbiwa moved to France at an early age and came through the ranks of Montpellier, with whom he signed his first professional contract in 2006. By the age of 19 he was a regular in the first team and his solid displays at right-back helped Montpellier secure promotion to the top flight in 2009. As he matured he switched to central defence, and sometimes midfield, and proved so accomplished there that the club had to fend off interest from several top sides including Arsenal. This year he helped make Montpellier French champions for the first time and made his debut for the senior France squad, for whom he is expected to be a pillar for a long time. He also became his club captain, playing in all six of the team&apos;s Champions League group stage matches this season. Paul Doyle 81: Victor Wanyama, Celtic, Kenya; age 21; midfielder The number 67 is now revered by Celtic fans for two reasons: not only is it the year in which the Lisbon Lions became European champions, it is also the shirt number of Victor Wanyama, the latest Parkhead player on course for greatness. The \u00a3900,000 that the club paid to the Belgian side Beerschot last year looks a pittance for a defender-cum-midfielder with awesome power and influence. While he can spread havoc among opposing defenders Wanyama himself remains composed, consistently choosing the right options after marauding into positions to do damage. Just as rivals struggle to contain the Kenyan, Celtic will struggle to hold on to him after performances such as the one he delivered in October&apos;s Champions League group stage victory over Barcelona. Paul Doyle 80: Luka Modric, Real Madrid, Croatia; age 27; midfielder Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was appropriately effusive after Real Madrid had spent \u00a330m on his No1 target this summer. &quot;He can play in so many different positions,&quot; the Portuguese said. &quot;He has the magic typical of the great talents of football. He is a player a manager wants because of his footballing potential and his tactical knowledge.&quot; However, the Croat has not had the easiest of starts at Real. As the team have struggled, so has he. It was never going to be easy breaking into a talented midfield \u2013 and Modric, upon signing, admitted it would be a huge challenge just to get into the team. Modric scored his first goal for his new club against Real Zaragoza at the start of November but has been in and out of the team with a low coming on 16 December when he was substituted at half-time against Espanyol. It is worth remembering that Modric made a quiet start to life at White Hart Lane too. He cost \u00a316.5m when he arrived from Dinamo Zagreb in the summer of 2008 and the first few months under Juande Ramos were difficult as the team struggled and he adapted. However, after Harry Redknapp took over, the Croat flourished and his manager revealed that he had discussed the midfielder with Sir Alex Ferguson before taking over at Spurs. &quot;Sir Alex said to me last year that he could play in any team. I agree with him, he&apos;s so good,&quot; Redknapp said. Now Modric has arrived at that &quot;any team&quot;. All he needs to do now is to get into it. Marcus Christenson 79: David Luiz, Chelsea, Brazil; age 25; defender David Luiz was 14 years old when S\u00e3o Paulo dismissed him on the grounds he would not be tall enough for top-level football. He left his family home for Vit\u00f3ria EC, a club a thousand miles away. Eleven years later he has a Champions League winners&apos; medal, having played a heroic part in Chelsea&apos;s triumph in May: the defender suffered a thigh injury two days before the match but played 120 minutes and dispatched his shootout penalty past Manuel Neuer. David Luiz has also become a cult hero at Stamford Bridge and a regular in Brazil&apos;s plans for the 2014 World Cup \u2013 his partnership with Thiago Silva is one of the hosts&apos; few certainties. Not bad for somebody once described as looking like a video-game character being controlled by a 10-year-old in the crowd. Fernando Duarte 78: Patrice Evra, Manchester United, France; age 31; defender Once lauded by Sir Alex Ferguson as the best left-back in the world, Evra&apos;s star has been on the wane of late. Showing the first signs of age at 31, he has struggled to keep pace against younger opponents and fallen out of favour with a section of the United support. Following Alexander Buttner&apos;s impressive debut in his position in September, Evra told reporters he was prepared to fight for his place. And yet for all his recent displays might not match up to his best from seasons past, there are still few better in that role. With a growing number of teams in Italy and Spain shifting towards three-man defences, the pool of world-class left-backs capable of playing in a classic back four is increasingly shallow, and Evra remains one of the biggest fish within it. Paolo Bandini 77: Mario Mandzukic, Bayern Munich, Croatia; age 26; forward The Croat&apos;s current dip in form for Bayern Munich is far from Fernando Torres proportions but is still causing puzzlement in light of how well he started his career with the German giants, who signed him following his impressive Euro 2012 campaign for his country. A lithe and lethal finisher, he scored prolifically for Wolfsburg and Dinamo Zagreb before\u00a0joining Bayern, for whom he struck on his debut to help win the German Super Cup. Strong in the air and endowed with deft feet and agile movement, the 26-year-old can serve as both target man and poacher and has the class to finish the season as his\u00a0club&apos;s top scorer despite temporary travails. He has scored 36 times for his country since making his debut in 2007.\u00a0Paul Doyle 76: Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Porto, Portugal; age 26; midfielder The player who made Portugal tick at Euro 2012 and the subject of a late Tottenham bid on transfer deadline day. The papers arrived too late to make the midfielder Spurs&apos; record signing for \u00a320m but the club may well revisit the deal in January. An all-round player with superb vision, the only question mark attached to him concerns his goalscoring record: zero in 2010-11, three in 2011-12 and two this season at the time of writing. Fell out with Sporting when he left for Porto in 2010, the club president, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Bettencourt, saying: &quot;There were zero offers, at zero euros. If I have a \u20ac200m house, need to sell it and no one bids higher, I have to accept the best offer. As a man, we won&apos;t miss him. A rotten apple will contaminate the environment.&quot; Marcus Christenson 75: Ezequiel Lavezzi, Paris St-Germain, Argentina; age 27, forward Despite all scientific regimes available to the modern footballer, thank goodness there is still room in the game for a player nicknamed El Pocho, or Tubby. The ghost of Ferenc Puskas rises to applaud Lavezzi, an inside-forward of the old school, making goals for others while averaging one in every four matches on his own account. After starting his career with Estudiantes and San Lorenzo in his native Argentina, he joined Napoli, where his partnership with Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik took the club to heights unknown since Diego Maradona bestrode the San Paolo stadium. Last summer the Italian club were unable to resist a \u20ac30m offer from Paris Saint-Germain, where he has been settling in alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Richard Williams 74: Christian Eriksen, Ajax, Denmark; age 20; midfielder The world is waiting for the young Danish playmaker to fulfil the potential that attracted the scouts of Ajax when he was 16 and convinced Martin Jol that he would become the successor to Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart. Deft and perceptive, with the ability to contribute his share of goals, Eriksen made his Eredivisie debut at 17 and received his first senior cap at 18, making him the country&apos;s youngest international since Michael Laudrup. He played in two of Denmark&apos;s three matches at the 2010 World Cup, and in 2011 there was no dispute over his man of the match award in a friendly against England in Copenhagen, even though the match was lost. Richard Williams 73: Santi Cazorla, Arsenal, Spain; age 28; midfielder The Spanish press have been known to refer to him as &quot;168cm of happiness&quot; and there is something of his sunny nature which translates directly to his game. Cazorla plays with a smile, and more often than not, his creative style engenders a similar response in those who watch. The Spain international and European champion spent the bulk of his career with Villarreal, before switching to M\u00e1laga, where Arsenal got a bargain. In London he instantly caught the imagination with his dash and guile. Even Mikel Arteta can&apos;t work out which is his preferred foot. Amy Lawrence 72: Pedro, Barcelona, Spain; age 25; forward No one had heard of Pedro when Pep Guardiola turned up at Barcelona. In fact the coaching reports recommended that the club should let him go. Guardiola liked his speed and incisive finishing, kept him on at Barcelona B and then promoted him to the first team. Two years later he was a World Cup winner. Mobile and quick, he puts pressure on opponents high up the pitch, giving Barcelona an intensity sometimes lacking without him, and has the happy knack of scoring important goals. His timing is exceptional. Sid Lowe 71: Hernanes, Lazio, Brazil; age 27; midfielder He has never competed in the Champions League and has yet to receive significant international recognition, so Hernanes is relatively unappreciated outside of Italy. Yet the Lazio midfielder has been superb in 2012, dictating the flow and providing creativity. He has a great relationship with the striker Miroslav Klose and is a threat from open play and free-kicks. Brazil&apos;s coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has declared himself a fan \u2013 Hernanes may yet be Brazil&apos;s 2014 hero.

And this year is likely to be no better as it celebrates its first Christmas after the recognition of Palestine as a state and at the end of a record year in tourism, making it likely that there will once more be no room at the inn. Tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists are expected to visit the birthplace of Jesus over Christmas. All of the West Bank city&apos;s 3,700 hotel rooms are likely to be filled, with thousands more visitors making day trips from nearby Jerusalem. This year has seen a 20% growth in the numbers of visitors to Bethlehem compared with the previous year, and officials hope for a further rise in tourism to Palestine next year. The biggest number of tourists \u2013 more than a quarter \u2013 come from Russia. Officials are heartened by the increasing number of visitors who are opting to stay in hotels in Bethlehem rather than just making the trip from Jerusalem. The number of overnight stays is expected to reach 1.5m by the end of this year. Hotel rates in Bethlehem are about half the price of the equivalent accommodation in Jerusalem, which is just six miles away. But officials say the local tourist industry still faces huge hurdles as a result of Israel&apos;s continued occupation of the West Bank. Israel controls all entry to the West Bank. Tourists and pilgrims either have to fly into Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv or cross overland from neighbouring Jordan via borders controlled by Israel. Palestinian tour buses are forbidden from entering Israel to collect visitors from the airport and they are not allowed to take groups to visit holy sites in Jerusalem or Galilee. Tourists and pilgrims to Israel are usually brought to Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity and other historic sites on short visits organised by Israeli tour operators. Palestinian officials say such visitors rarely stay overnight or spend money in local restaurants and souvenir shops. &quot;Ninety percent of tourism to Bethlehem is controlled by Israel,&quot; said local tourism expert George Rishmawi. &quot;Many tourists are warned against coming to the West Bank, and are afraid to cross the wall,&quot; he added, referring to the concrete barrier that separates Bethlehem from Jerusalem. Since the wall was constructed around Bethlehem almost 10 years ago, local businesses have struggled in the face of restrictions on movement and access. Farmers in the area have also seen much of their land taken over in the past four decades since the six-day war for the construction of the 20 settlements close to Bethlehem. But tourism, one of the main economic sectors, has picked up over the past year. &quot;Next year, we are expecting a further increase,&quot; said Samir Hazboun, the chairman of the Bethlehem Chamber of Commerce. &quot;We are working on new markets, such as India and Latin America.&quot; Officials hoped that the United Nations&apos; implicit recognition of the state of Palestine and the inclusion of Bethlehem on the list of world heritage sites by the UN&apos;s cultural arm, Unesco, would further boost tourist numbers. The city is planning to increase the number of hotel beds, offer improved packages and invest in marketing and promotion, said Hazboun. &quot;OK, we are living in a big prison, but we still hope that things will change.&quot; Bethlehem is &quot;a symbol of hope and peace&quot; to the world, said Rishmawi. However, he added: &quot;Hotels in Bethlehem will be full at Christmas, but we need families to come here all the year round, to walk in our streets and eat in our restaurants.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-12-21T17:26:40Z", "title": "No room at the inn \u2013 but Bethlehem's popularity is a boon for Palestinians", "sentences": ["Tourists and pilgrims either have to fly into Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv or cross overland from neighbouring Jordan via borders controlled by Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/21/bethlehem-popularity-boon-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Christianity", "Middle East and North Africa", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "Amid plastic bags snagged on gorse bushes, rusting hulks of cars in a breakers yard and a few shabby trailers, traces of a biblical landscape are still to be found on a hillside between the ancient cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. A couple of donkeys are tethered to a gnarled olive tree; nearby, sheep and goats bleat as they huddle against the chill December air. But this terrain will soon be covered in concrete after the authorisation last week of the construction of more than 2,600 homes in Givat Hamatos, the first new Israeli settlement to be built since 1997. It lies between two existing settlements: Gilo, home to 40,000 people, sits atop one hill; to its east, on another hill, stands Har Homa, whose population is around 20,000, with further expansion in the pipeline. Both are largely built on Bethlehem land. Givat Hamatos will form a strategic link between these twin towns, further impeding access between Bethlehem and the intended capital of Palestine, East Jerusalem, just six miles away. Israel considers these and other settlements across the Green Line to be legitimate suburbs of Jerusalem, which it claims as the unified, indivisible capital of the Jewish state. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and official bodies have announced a spate of expansion plans in recent weeks. In the birthplace of Jesus, the impact of Israeli settlements and their growth has been devastating. In a Christmas message, the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said Bethlehem was enduring a &quot;choking reality&quot;. He added: &quot;For the first time in 2,000 years of Christianity in our homeland, the Holy Cities of Bethlehem and Jerusalem have been completely separated by Israeli settlements, racist walls and checkpoints.&quot; Bethlehem is now surrounded by 22 settlements, including Nokdim, where the hardline former Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman lives, and Neve Daniel, home to public diplomacy minister Yuli Edelstein. The city is further hemmed in by the vast concrete and steel separation barrier, bypasses connecting settlements with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and Israeli military zones. With little room to expand, it is now more densely populated than Gaza, according to one Palestinian official. In Beit Sahour \u2013 the site on the eastern edge of Bethlehem where, according to Christian tradition, angels announced the birth of Jesus to shepherds in a field \u2013 William Sahouri is feeling the squeeze. Ten years ago, he moved into a housing project designated for young Christian families, which overlooks fields and hills where sheep once grazed. Now most of that land is on the other side of the separation barrier, inaccessible to Palestinians. Har Homa \u2013 which, like all settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, is illegal under international law \u2013 is rapidly spreading down the hill. Cranes are at work on new apartment blocks; bulldozers are flattening land for new roads and buildings. In contrast, Sahouri&apos;s home, along with others in the neighbourhood, is under an Israeli demolition order. It was issued in 2002 soon after the apartments were built without a permit, which is almost impossible to get in areas of the West Bank under full Israeli military control. After protests, the order was frozen but not lifted. &quot;It&apos;s like sitting on a bomb,&quot; says Sahouri, who estimates his family&apos;s presence in the area stretches back more than 300 years. &quot;We don&apos;t know when it will be blown. At any moment they could come with bulldozers and heavy machinery and everything will be gone.&quot; But, he adds, gesturing across to Har Homa, &quot;the Israelis can build 1,000 homes in three months. In 10 years, they build a city, while we have to build stone by stone.&quot; Residents of Beit Sahour \u2013 whose 15,000 population is 80% Christian \u2013 say settlers have targeted another nearby spot. A former Israeli military base at Ush Ghurab is visited almost weekly by hardliners from settlements deep in the West Bank, who have repainted the abandoned buildings, planted trees and raised Israeli flags. The site is now known as Shdema to the settlers, who hold regular meetings and activities on the hilltop. Local Palestinians fear that the visitors will begin to sleep at the former base, then expand the site with additional caravans, followed by the provision of services \u2013 electricity, water, roads \u2013 and eventually permanent homes. This is a familiar pattern of how radical settlements, unauthorised by the Israeli state, take shape. &quot;This area is being highly targeted,&quot; says local Palestinian activist George Rishmawi. &quot;Experience tells us this is how settlements start \u2013 with the actions of fanatics.&quot; On the other side of Bethlehem, another mainly Christian community is also facing a battle, this one against the planned route of the separation barrier. Under present proposals it will cut off 58 families, plus a monastery and convent, from their land. The monks and nuns of Cremisan have joined forces with residents to fight a legal battle over the route, which will be decided in the Israeli courts early next year. &quot;The wall will confiscate nearly all our land,&quot; says Samira Qaisieh, whose house on the edge of Beit Jala was built by her husband&apos;s family almost a century ago. Its vine-covered terrace looks across the valley to Gilo, the Israeli settlement, built on land she says was owned by her grandfather. &quot;Israel says it is doing all this in the name of security. But really they just want a land without [Palestinian] people.&quot; Qaisieh is thinking of leaving unless the barrier is re-routed. &quot;There is no work here. If we lose our land, what is there to stay for? What is the future for my children?&quot; About two-thirds of the 400-mile West Bank barrier is complete; 85% of its route runs inside the West Bank, swallowing almost 8.5% of Palestinian land. In 2004, the International Court of Justice ruled it was illegal and that construction must stop. The wall already snakes around most of Bethlehem, its 8m-high concrete slabs casting a deep shadow, both literally and metaphorically. At the Christmas Tree restaurant, where there are almost no takers for the &quot;Quick Lunches&quot; on offer, business has slowed to a standstill since the wall blocked what was once the main Jerusalem-Bethlehem road. Scores of shops along the closed-off artery have shut down altogether. A few hundred metres along from the empty restaurant, a long steel-caged corridor leading through multiple turnstiles to a checkpoint is the main exit from the city for Palestinians wishing to go to Jerusalem. The Israel Defence Forces issues thousands of extra permits to Christian Palestinians to allow them to visit holy sites in Jerusalem over Christmas, but the lack of routine access has had a dire impact on businesses and employment rates. Bethlehem has one of the highest rates of unemployment of all West Bank cities, at 18%, says Vera Baboun, who was elected as its first female mayor in October. &quot;We are a strangulated city, with no room for expansion due to the settlements and the wall.&quot; In a booklet to mark Christmas 2012, Kairos Palestine, a Christian alliance, says: &quot;Land confiscation, as well as the influx of Israeli settlers, suggest that there will be no future for Palestinians (Christian or Muslim) in [this] area. In this sense, the prospect of a clear &apos;solution&apos; grows darker every day.&quot; Over recent decades Christians have left Bethlehem in their thousands, and now are a minority in a city they once dominated. In 2008 Christians accounted for 28% of Bethlehem city&apos;s population of about 25,000. The daily grind of living under occupation, with few opportunities, little hope and the violence of the Palestinian uprising 10 years ago are cited as the chief reasons for departure. But in the past few years the flood of emigrants has slowed. &quot;We are here, and we will remain here, to help our new state become a reality,&quot; says Nora Carmi of Kairos. In Beit Jala, parish priest Father Ibrahim Shomali, who leads open-air prayers under olive trees at sunset every Friday to protest at the planned route of the barrier around the Cremisan monastery, fears its construction could lead to a fresh wave of Christian departures. &quot;People are leaving,&quot; he says wearily. &quot;But some of us will stay, to pray and resist.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-12-23T00:09:06Z", "title": "Bethlehem Christians feel the squeeze as Israeli settlements spread", "sentences": ["The city is further hemmed in by the vast concrete and steel separation barrier, bypasses connecting settlements with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and Israeli military zones."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/23/bethlehem-christians-feel-squeeze-settlements"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Egypt", "Africa", "Migration and development", "Global development", "Eritrea", "Sudan"], "article": "The number of migrants crossing the border between Egypt and Israel dropped to zero last week for the first time since 2006, as construction of the last small sections of a 150-mile fence is due to be completed in the coming weeks. A total of 36 migrants crossed into Israel from Egypt in December, all of whom were detained, compared with 2,295 in January. The numbers have steadily declined throughout 2012 as construction of the vast steel fence through the desert from Eilat to the border with Gaza has progressed. &quot;We have succeeded in blocking the phenomenon of illegal infiltrators,&quot; said the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. &quot;It has been several months now that no infiltrator has reached [the Israeli cities of] Eilat, Be&apos;er Sheva, Tel Aviv or any Israeli community.&quot; Israel was repatriating migrants to their countries of origin, he said. &quot;For several months now, hundreds of infiltrators have been leaving here\u00a0\u2026 and thousands will soon do so every month until the tens of thousands of people who are here illegally return to their countries of origin.&quot; More than 9,000 migrants were deported in 2012, including almost 4,000 from African countries. Critics of the deportation policy say many migrants face extreme danger in their home countries. &quot;There is no doubt the fence is working as a deterrent,&quot; said Sigal Rosen, of the Hotline for Migrant Workers. But, she added, Israel&apos;s policy of preventing refugees crossing the fence, which is constructed on Israeli territory, was illegal under international law. &quot;If a person is asking for asylum, a country has a duty to check their request.&quot; The fence along Israel&apos;s southern border is estimated to have cost about 1.4bn shekels (\u00a3240m). Israel now has physical barriers along all its land borders apart from one section abutting Jordan, from Eilat to the Dead Sea. Plans to erect a fence along that border are under discussion. Israel accelerated construction of the southern border fence after an attack by militants in August 2011 in which eight Israelis were killed, with the aim of completing it by the end of 2012. The remaining gaps, which total eight miles, are on mountainous terrain near the Red Sea resort of Eilat. The purpose of the fence is to deter illegal immigration, cross-border militant activity and the smuggling of drugs and weapons. More than 65,000 migrants\u201a mainly from Eritrea and Sudan, have entered Israel illegally from Egypt since 2006, according to government figures. A US state department report on human rights noted that Israel approved one out of 4,603 applications for asylum in 2011. The latest immigration figures came as an Eritrean man appeared in court in Tel Aviv on Monday, accused of raping an 83-year-old woman on 21 December. The interior minister, Eli Yishai, said: &quot;The shocking rape is a symptom of a loss of sense of security among Israeli citizens in areas where there are high concentrations of infiltrators.&quot; Leaders of a far-right party called for a mass protest in Tel Aviv on Monday evening. Rosen said she was afraid it could turn into a pogrom. Anti-migrant sentiment was growing &quot;because of incitement by politicians against Africans&quot;, she said. Earlier this year, Yishai suggested migrants were committing rapes and were &quot;Aids carriers&quot;.
