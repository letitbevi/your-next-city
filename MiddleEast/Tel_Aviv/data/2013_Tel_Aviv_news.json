Figures released by the central bureau of statistics this week show the total population of Israel at 7.98 million, 75.4% of whom are Jewish. Just over 20% are Arab and 4% are defined as &quot;other&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s a great joy to know there are more than 6 million Jews in Israel,&quot; said Dina Porat, chief historian of Yad Vashem, Israel&apos;s Holocaust museum and head of the Kantor centre for the study of contemporary European Jewry. &quot;But worldwide we are still in the same place. Before the Holocaust there were around 18 million Jews in the world; after it, a bit more than 13 million. We are still at a bit more than 13 million. But now Israel&apos;s Jewish population is close to half the Jewish nation worldwide. It puts Israel in a very central place. We are almost the only Jewish community that is growing.&quot; Six million was a &quot;significant number&quot;, said Anita Shapira, professor of Jewish history at Tel Aviv university. But, she added, &quot;living Jews do not compensate for dead Jews. The number [6 million] symbolises a catastrophe, not a recuperation. We are still paying for the Holocaust.&quot; Avraham Burg, former speaker of the Israeli parliament and author of The Holocaust is Over; We Must Rise From its Ashes, said 6 million was a &quot;symbolic number but random&quot;. &quot;Is Israel any different if it has 5.9 million Jews, or 6.1 million? The answer is no. I don&apos;t see the state of Israel as either compensation or revenge for the Holocaust. Israel is a standalone entity. Yes, we have the looming shadow of our history, and the victims of the Holocaust should be cherished and remembered, but it should not define our politics,&quot; Burg said. Israel, he added, &quot;is not a state of 6 million Jews but of almost 8 million citizens&quot;. &quot;Each and everyone of us should be equal, regardless of our creed or race.&quot; Separate figures released by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics predicts the number of Arabs in Israel and Palestine will equal the number of Jews by 2016, and exceed it by 2020. There are 5.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and Israel, and 11.6 million worldwide, it said. The Palestinian birth rate was 4.4 in 2009, down from 6.0 in 1997, but higher than the Israeli Jewish birth rate of about 3.0. This demographic trend is the chief argument put forward by Israeli Jews against a single binational state as a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The inevitable Arab majority in such a state would mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state, they say. The Jewish population of Israel has increased almost tenfold since the state was declared in May 1948, when there were about 660,000 Jewish citizens, according to the Israeli CBS (pdf). At least 700,000 Palestinians \u2013 a big majority of the Arab population of Palestine \u2013 fled or were forced to leave their homes and land in the 1948 war.", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T12:56:00Z", "title": "Israel's Jewish population passes 6 million mark", "sentences": ["We are almost the only Jewish community that is growing.&quot; Six million was a &quot;significant number&quot;, said Anita Shapira, professor of Jewish history at Tel Aviv university."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/israel-jewish-population-six-million"}, {"tags": ["Science", "Chemistry", "Science prizes", "People in science", "Nobel prizes"], "article": "To stand your ground in the face of relentless criticism from a double Nobel prize-winning scientist takes a lot of guts. For engineer and materials scientist Dan Shechtman, however, years of self-belief in the face of the eminent Linus Pauling&apos;s criticisms led him to the ultimate accolade: his own Nobel prize. Shechtman was the sole winner of the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2011, for his discovery of seemingly impossible crystal structures in metal alloys. Instead of the regular pattern seen in other crystallised materials, the atoms in his &quot;quasi-period materials&quot; were arranged so that they were regular but never repeated. It is a type of pattern seen in the tiled Islamic mosaics at the Alhambra Palace in Spain and the Darb-i Imam shrine in Iran, but which had never been thought could exist in nature. His discovery in the early 1980s changed chemistry, but convincing some parts of the establishment was not easy. Scientists have subsequently found naturally occurring quasi-periodic crystals in minerals in a Russian river and a Swedish steel company found that these types of crystal were responsible for the strength of some of its ultra-strong steels. Scientists are now working out ways to use quasi-periodic crystals in everything from diesel engines to frying pans. Shechtman was born in Tel Aviv in 1941 and received his PhD from Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, in 1972. He had become interested in engineering at a young age, after reading Jules Verne&apos;s The Mysterious Island, in which a group of people are stranded on an island, far from any civilisation. &quot;The key figure in that book is Cyrus Smith \u2013 he&apos;s an engineer and he could do everything, he could do anything, and I wanted to be like him.&quot; After finishing his military service, he went to the Technion to study mechanical engineering. But when he graduated in 1966, a recession\u00a0in Israel meant that he could\u00a0not find a job. He started a master&apos;s degree instead, thinking he would find a job when the economic troubles had passed. &quot;But then I fell in love with science and decided to continue for my PhD and from there on I was a scientist.&quot; In April 1982, Shechtman was on sabbatical at America&apos;s National Institute of Standards and Technology, when he saw something curious through his electron microscope. &quot;Eyn chaya kazo,&quot; he said to himself (&quot;there can be no such creature&quot; in Hebrew). He had been studying a rapidly cooled mix of aluminium and manganese, an alloy with potential uses in aerospace technologies, and saw something that was forbidden according to known chemistry. The atoms in the sample seemed to be arranged in a pattern that had a five-fold rotational symmetry. The atoms in a solid material are arranged in an orderly fashion and that order is usually periodic and will have a particular rotational symmetry. A square arrangement, for example, has four-fold rotational symmetry \u2013 turn the atoms through 90 degrees and it will look the same. Do this four times and you get back to its start point. Three-fold symmetry means an arrangement can be turned through 120 degrees and it will look the same. There is also one-fold symmetry (turn through 360 degrees), two-fold (turn through 180 degrees) and six-fold symmetry (turn through 60 degrees). Five-fold symmetry is not allowed in periodic crystals and nothing beyond six, purely for geometric reasons. Shechtman&apos;s results were so out of the ordinary that, even after he had checked his findings several times, it took two years for his work to get published in a peer-reviewed journal. Once it appeared, he says, &quot;all hell broke loose&quot;. Many scientists thought that Shechtman had not been careful enough in his experiments and that he had simply made a mistake. &quot;The bad reaction was the head of my laboratory, who came to my office one day and, smiling sheepishly, put a book on x-ray diffraction on my desk and said, &apos;Danny, please read this book and you will understand that what you are saying cannot be.&apos; And I told him, you know, I don&apos;t need to read this book, I teach at the Technion, and I know this book, and I&apos;m telling you my material is not in the book. &quot;He came back a couple of days later and said to me, &apos;Danny, you are a disgrace to my group. I cannot be with you in the same group.&apos; So I left the group and found another group that adopted a scientific orphan.&quot; He says that the experience was not\u00a0as traumatic as it sounded. Scientists around the world had quickly replicated Shechtman&apos;s discovery and, in 1992, the International Union of Crystallography accepted that quasi-periodic materials must exist and altered its definition of what a crystal is from &quot;a substance in which the constituent atoms, molecules or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating three-dimensional pattern&quot; to the broader &quot;any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram&quot;. That should have been the end of the story were it not for Linus Pauling, a two-time Nobel laureate, once for chemistry and a second time for peace. Shechtman explains that at a science conference in front of an audience of hundreds Pauling claimed, &quot;Danny Shechtman is talking nonsense, there are no quasi-crystals, just quasi-scientists.&quot; Pauling told everyone who would listen that Shechtman had made a mistake. He proposed his own explanations for the observed five-fold symmetry and stuck to his guns, despite repeated rebuttals. &quot;Everything he did was wrong and wrong and wrong and wrong; eventually, he couldn&apos;t publish his papers and they were rejected before they were published,&quot; says Shechtman. &quot;But he was very insistent, was very sure of himself when he spoke; he was a flamboyant speaker.&quot; Lesley Yellowlees, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said that fundamental science was about breaking through the boundaries of knowledge and sometimes that means pursuing an idea that others think is just too unbelievable to be true. &quot;Dan Shechtman&apos;s Nobel prize celebrated not only a fascinating and beautiful discovery, but also dogged determination against the closed-minded ridicule of his peers, including leading scientists of the day. His prize didn&apos;t just reward a difficult but worthy career in science; it put the huge importance and value of funding basic scientific research in the spotlight.&quot; A few years before he died, Pauling wrote to Shectman to suggest a truce of sorts. &quot;And the letter says, &apos;Professor Shechtman, may I propose to you to write the joint Shechtman-Pauling paper on quasi-periodic materials? And you will be first,&apos; he says. And I answered him with a letter: &apos;Professor Pauling, I&apos;ll be delighted to write this paper with you, but before we even start we have to agree that quasi-periodic materials do exist.&apos; He wrote me back and said, &apos;Well, that may be too early for that.&apos; And that was the end of our communication.&quot; For the past 27 years, in addition to chemistry, he has been teaching a class at the Technion on technological entrepreneurship. &quot;I know humanity has periods of ups and downs and we are not in a good period now, because of economic problems. But hopefully we will climb again and hopefully the distribution of wealth in the world will be more just and more people will be able to enjoy a prosperity. But in order to do that, each country has to develop. And start-up companies, hi-tech companies, small companies that will grow \u2013 this will lead us to a better future.&quot; And the downsides to winning a Nobel prize? The punishing schedule and living out of a suitcase are both mentally and physically stressful, says Shechtman. &quot;But then again, because I feel like a missionary to promote education and science and technological entrepreneurship, for me, it&apos;s one big celebration.&quot; Big questions What is the most exciting field of science at the moment? Biology and medical sciences. Do you believe in a god? No. What book about science should everyone read? The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S Kuhn. Has Cern been worth the money? Definitely yes. The frontiers of science, on the very small scale and very large scale, require large investments and international effort. If we really want to understand the laws of physics \u2013 and we do \u2013 we need these investments made. What advice would you give a teenager who wants a career in science? Select a subject that interests you and make an effort to become an expert in that field. I promise you, if you make the effort, and you become an expert, you will have a wonderful career. What scientific advance would make the most difference to your daily life? The development of new effective drugs, new efficient batteries and clean, inexpensive energy sources. Are you worried about population increase? Not at all. The good news is world population growth rate decreases systematically and is expected to reach zero by 2050, thanks to urbanisation and women&apos;s education. The bad news is while in most developed countries the number of children per woman is 1 to 1.5, that number in many developing countries is 6-7. If politicians were replaced by scientists, would the world be better place? No, both politics and science would suffer.", "publicationDate": "2013-01-06T00:07:00Z", "title": "Dan Shechtman: 'Linus Pauling said I was talking nonsense'", "sentences": ["Shechtman was born in Tel Aviv in 1941 and received his PhD from Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, in 1972."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/06/dan-shechtman-nobel-prize-chemistry-interview"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is &quot;insoluble&quot; and most Israelis &quot;couldn&apos;t care less about it any more&quot;, according to Naftali Bennett, the surprise star of the election campaign, whose extreme rightwing nationalist and pro-settler Jewish Home is within sight of becoming the country&apos;s second biggest party. In an interview with the Guardian, Bennett said he did not intend to waste the next four years &quot;babbling about Israel and the Palestinians&quot;, and defended his plan to annex most of the West Bank in the face of international opposition, which was the &quot;result of ignorance&quot;. &quot;There is not going to be a Palestinian state within the tiny land of Israel,&quot; he said, referring to the area from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean. &quot;It&apos;s just not going to happen. A Palestinian state would be a disaster for the next 200 years.&quot; Bennett acknowledged that Binyamin Netanyahu was almost certain to continue as prime minister following the election on 22 January, but added: &quot;The big question is the question of power. If we get enough seats in the next Knesset [parliament], we&apos;ll become the biggest and most influential partner in Netanyahu&apos;s next government.&quot; He declined to be drawn on which cabinet post he would seek as a key coalition partner, but said his primary concern was the economy. &quot;If there is one thing I would want to achieve over the next four years, it is to break up the monopolies here and to break the stranglehold the big unions have on the Israeli economy. I think it&apos;s a sin that most Israelis can barely [afford to] live here.&quot; Under Bennett&apos;s leadership, Jewish Home has experienced a spectacular rise in the polls since the start of the election campaign, causing panic and dismay within the main rightwing alliance, headed by Netanyahu, from which support has drained. A poll in the Jerusalem Post on Friday put Jewish Home at 16 seats in the 120-place parliament, while Netanyahu&apos;s Likud-Beiteinu was predicted to win 32 \u2013 down from 45 forecast at the start of the campaign. Another poll put Jewish Home equal to Labour, on 18 seats each. Bennett said his priorities were &quot;to restore values to Israeli politics&quot;, to lower the cost of living and to advocate a &quot;more realistic&quot; approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. &quot;If we hand over [the West Bank] to the Arabs, life here will be miserable and in constant conflict for the next 200 years,&quot; he said. &quot;I want the world to understand that a Palestinian state means no Israeli state. That&apos;s the equation.&quot; Instead of a two-state solution, Bennett has proposed the unilateral annexation of Area C, the 60% of the West Bank that contains all Jewish settlements and is currently under Israeli military control. Palestinians living in Area C could either take Israeli citizenship or relocate to the Palestinian-governed 40% of the West Bank. Bennett conceded that the international community would strongly oppose such a plan. &quot;I don&apos;t accept it&apos;s illegal under international law, but I agree the world would not recognise [annexation]. The world hasn&apos;t recognised Jerusalem as our capital, or the Western Wall as part of Israel, so this would just be another area that the world doesn&apos;t recognise.&quot; Mounting European criticism of Israeli government policies, especially settlement expansion, was of concern, but was misguided, he said. &quot;It&apos;s a result of ignorance and lack of knowledge from our European friends. It&apos;s also the result of a confused policy from our own government, which sends mixed messages. You can agree or disagree with my views, but I&apos;m very clear: a Palestinian state would be a disaster for the next 200 years and would ensure continuous strife. What we are facing is a determined Muslim entity that wants to destroy Israel.&quot; Jewish Home is all but certain to be part of the next coalition government, tilting it significantly further to the right. Among those likely to become members of parliament under Israel&apos;s electoral system \u2013 in which voters back parties, not individuals \u2013 is Orit Struck, a radical activist from the hardline settlement in the heart of the Palestinian city of Hebron. &quot;Orit lives side by side with Arabs in Hebron,&quot; said Bennett, in an unusual way of describing tension surrounding thesettlers&apos; enclave in which Palestinian residents are banned from walking or driving along the main street. &quot;Every party has a spectrum [of candidates] and I totally defend my list.&quot; Bennett, 40, lives in Ra&apos;anana, an affluent town north of Tel Aviv, with his secular wife, a former pastry chef, and their four children under the age of seven. After serving in the Israeli military&apos;s most elite commando unit, Sayeret Matkal, he built an anti-fraud software company, which was sold seven years ago for $145m (\u00a390m). Asked what he spent his money on, he said: &quot;Buying books \u2013 big spending sprees, mostly biographies.&quot; He served as Netanyahu&apos;s chief of staff for four years until 2008. Bennett generated huge controversy last month when he said he personally would refuse orders to evacuate settlements or outposts in the West Bank while on reserve army duty. &quot;If I receive an order to evict a Jew from his house and expel him, personally, my conscience wouldn&apos;t allow it,&quot; he told Israel&apos;s Channel 2. &quot;But I wouldn&apos;t publicly call for disobeying orders.&quot; He backtracked after a storm of criticism, although he told a rally on Sunday that all political parties should sign a pledge never to evict Jews from their homes. His duty as a coalition partner would be to stop Netanyahu veering to the left, he said. &quot;The Israeli-Palestinian issue is something we can talk about for ever, but it&apos;s never going anywhere. I can waste the next four years babbling about Israel and the Palestinians, or the alternative is to say this is insoluble, so let&apos;s work out a modus vivendi with our neighbours the best we can. For too many years, Israel has been taken hostage by this conflict.&quot; The parties There are 34 parties competing for 120 seats in the Israeli parliament on 22 \u00a0January. The main ones are: \u2022 Likud-Beiteinu: the rightwing electoral alliance between prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s ruling Likud party and former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beiteinu. It is expected to win the largest number of seats in the parliament, and therefore form the next coalition government. Latest poll: 32 seats. \u2022 Labour: the main centre-left party. Its leader, Shelly Yachimovich, has sought to focus its campaign on socio-economic issues and has veered away from discussing the Israeli-Palestinian question. Latest poll: 17. \u2022 Jewish Home: formerly the National Religious party, relaunched under Naftali Bennett. To the right of Likud-Beiteinu, it is pro-settler and opposed to a Palestinian state. Latest poll: 16. \u2022 Hatnuah: a new centrist party formed by the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, who has called for negotiations with the Palestinians to resume. Latest poll: 10. \u2022 Shas: ultra-Orthodox religious party, fights hard for the economic and housing interests of its supporters. Latest poll: 10. \u2022 Yesh Atid: centrist party formed by television personality Yair Lapid. Strongly secular. Latest poll: 10. \u2022 Arab parties: three separate parties \u2013 Hadash, Balad and United Arab List \u2013 competing for the Israeli Arab vote. Latest poll: 11 in total. \u2022 Kadima: Though it is the largest party in the current parliament with 28 seats, the centre-right party formed by ex-prime minister Ariel Sharon has plummeted.

But Beijing is just one of hundreds of cities, largely in Asia, where poisonous air is now the fastest growing cause of death in urban populations. In the past few months there have been acute air pollution incidents reported in Bangladesh, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Pakistan. In Tehran, the desperate authorities had to close all public offices, schools, universities and banks twice in the last two months; In Nepal the army has had to give up its cars and in Kabul it has been reported that there are now more deaths as a result of air and water pollution than from conflict. Statistics are unreliable, with few cities able to monitor accurately either the source or the level of the cocktail of pollutants emitted by traffic, ships, industry, brick kilns and domestic heating. But go to the hospitals and doctors will tell you that up to 80% of people admitted come with respiratory or other chronic diseases linked to air pollution. In Tehran, more than 4,500 people were said to have died last year because of air pollution \u2013 but because cancers can take years to develop the true figure may be far higher. Perhaps because there are no drugs available to counter air pollution, it has never been taken as seriously by governments as other diseases like HIV/Aids or malaria, even though the World Health Organisation estimates more than 2 million people worldwide die every year from bad air and that it is now among the top 10 killers in the world. But governments may have to act as new research shows it to be rapidly worsening. The biggest study done so far, published one month ago in the Lancet suggested that, worldwide, a record 3.2 million people died from air pollution in 2010, compared with 800,000 in 2000. The annual Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report ranked air pollution for the first time in the world&apos;s top 10 list of killer diseases, with 1.2 million deaths a year in east Asia and China, and 712,000 in south Asia, including India. But while Beijing got the headlines this week, there is mounting evidence that air pollution in India is as bad, if not worse, than in China. A study conducted by satellite imagery by Tel Aviv University last year reported that Indian megacities were seeing double digit increases in air pollution. From 2002 to 2010, said the paper, Bangalore saw the second highest increase in air-pollution levels in the world at 34%,with Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Ahmedabad not far behind. Improvements in car and fuel technology have been made since 2000 but these are nullified by the sheer increase in car numbers. Nearly 18m cars are expected to be sold this year alone in India. The blame is variously levelled on the geography of cities, the inversion of temperatures especially in cold months which trap pollutants, the vastly increasing number of cars, power plants, forest fires and the boom in building construction. However, the Lancet study found that it was specifically the type of air pollution caused by car and truck exhaust that was doing the most health damage. There is increasing evidence too that the air pollution now plaguing cities is because the fuel being burned by millions of cars and motorbikes is heavily contaminated by dealers who mix petrol and diesel with kerosene, waste industrial solvents and other additives to produce cheaper fuel. The result is a cocktail of poisonous emissions, many of which are not picked up by government monitoring stations and which are not filtered out by catalytic converters. The scale of illegal fuel adulteration is unknown, but academic studies suggest it is rampant in poor countries like Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all of which depend on importing fuel from outside. One study in Nepal found that at least half the motorbikes in use had engines damaged by contaminated fuel. But rich countries should not think their air is clean. A report by the European environment agency found that almost one third of Europe&apos;s city dwellers are exposed to PM10 particulate concentrations above EU legal limits and 90-95% to concentrations of smaller and even more deadly PM2.5 particulates. If nothing is done to improve it, the EU expects to see 200,000 premature deaths a year in Europe by 2020 due to particle emissions alone. EU environment commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik spelled out the financial costs on the European economy in September: &quot;Clean air is an investment. We cannot afford not to act. In monetary terms \u2026 the associated costs [will] amount to between \u20ac189-609bn per year in 2020. Our current analysis shows that if we do nothing, we will see 200,000 premature deaths in the EU by 2020 due to particle emissions alone - but with concerted action, this number can be pushed down to 130,000. To invest in clean air means to invest in our future.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-01-17T14:00:06Z", "title": "Beijing is not the only Asian city with lethal air pollution", "sentences": ["A study conducted by satellite imagery by Tel Aviv University last year reported that Indian megacities were seeing double digit increases in air pollution."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/17/lethal-air-pollution-asia-cities"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Facebook", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Media", "Social networking", "Technology"], "article": "For millions, it&apos;s a way of idling away time, catching up on gossip, making social arrangements or playing FarmVille.

The initiative, called Real Democracy, has allowed hundreds of Israelis to &quot;donate&quot; their votes to Palestinians as a symbolic protest at what they perceive as a lack of democracy. It matches Israeli voters who are willing to give up their vote with Palestinians who decide how \u2013 or whether \u2013 the vote should be cast.

Yet music is more entwined with the life of the nation in Mali than perhaps any other place in the world: a political, cultural and social force. There was the griot tradition dating back centuries, then in post-independence days musicians were used to bond together a nation that lies on the faultline between the Arab and African worlds. More recently, a succession of sublime artists have blazed a trail around the world, their easily accessible, blues-based sounds making the word Mali even more synonymous with magical music. Some commentators talk about the situation in the Sahel as the African wing of the war on terror. This is far too simplistic given the complexities of events there, their deep roots in old grievances inflamed by newer issues such as feuds over the profits of drug-running and kidnapping. But at root this is now a cultural war \u2013 between modernity and the past, between tolerance and brutality, between unity and division. And this is why the music of Mali remains such a vital force in the fight for all our futures. It was excellent to hear the organisers of the Glastonbury festival announce yesterday that they would use Britain&apos;s most important musical event to highlight Malian music. Rokia Traor\u00e9, one of the most brilliant talents I have ever seen, will kick off the festivities; I advise you not to miss her. And to underline how artists from this nation have entranced so many of their fellow performers, we asked some artists from Africa and the west to tell us which tracks have most touched them. Ian Birrell, co-founder Africa Express Robert del NajaMassive Attack I first came across Amadou Bagayoko \u2013 the Amadou in Amadou and Mariam \u2013 when I arrived late in the Congo to join an Africa Express trip. He was like an oasis of calm amid the chaos, this super-cool dude playing incredible riffs on a beautiful gold guitar. I was meant to remix their track C&apos;est Ne Pas Bon, but in typical Massive Attack style never got round to it. It is hard to think of another song more relevant to what is happening right now. It just seems so wrong that this couple come from a country where musicians are being persecuted when they are such ambassadors for all that is good and strong about Mali. Baaba MaalSenegalese musician There is a wonderful record by Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Toumani Diabat\u00e9 called In the Heart of the Moon \u2013 it&apos;s my favourite Malian record. It reminds me of the sort of music I grew up listening to in Senegal. The melodies are so beautiful, and there is a simplicity that makes it accessible to everyone. And it is two great musicians coming together in a very natural way \u2013 they are totally in sync with each other. I can listen to it all day. Emily EavisCo-organiser of the Glastonbury festival           The Radio Tisdas Sessions is Tinariwen&apos;s first album, recorded at a radio station in Mali, and I got into it after seeing them play at Glastonbury in 2007. It was a muddy year at the festival, with a lot of rain all weekend, but two of the highlights for me were Tinariwen on the old Jazz World Stage (now the West Holts Stage) and Africa Express in The Park. We&apos;ve always had a lot of great African artists coming to play over the years but these two sets really stood out and maybe captured a bit of the rock&apos;n&apos;roll spirit that was needed in those conditions. Anyone who was there to see Rachid Taha and the enormous Africa Express band blasting out Rock the Casbah up on that hill will never forget it. And you could feel the same sense of excitement for Tinariwen when they came on in their traditional desert robes and knocked out this amazing, hypnotic blues. It felt as if you had entered another world and we all just got completely lost in it. There&apos;s such a mystery around them as a band and you hear tales of them roaming the desert on horseback, riding into town to play their music, guitars in one hand and rifles in the other. For them, just being able to play and perform music is a matter of life and death and they are constantly on the move. The music that they make is completely spellbinding and very powerful, it really affects you. John Paul JonesBassist with Led Zeppelin There is a song by Rokia Traor\u00e9 called Dounia (from the 2009 album Tchamantch\u00e9) that I absolutely love. It&apos;s beautifuly delicate but also a very complex piece of music. Her voice just floats above it.            My introduction to Malian music was through the blues of the late Ali Farka Tour\u00e9, and I loved his whole approach. I&apos;m not a student of it in any way, but it&apos;s a music I love to play \u2013 I&apos;ve played with Afel Bocoum, who played with Ali, and with Rokia, as well as with Fatoumata Diawara. There&apos;s always a lot going on, so you really have to pay attention, but unlike Congolese music, for instance, it tends to be very gentle, too. The riffs are very melodic and it&apos;s very soulful, very subtle. I find the Rokia song particularly uplifting.Reading this on mobile? Click here Nick GoldProducer of the Buena Vista Social Club, Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and others In 1990, the late, great Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 gave me a cassette and said: &quot;Ca c&apos;est la musique.&quot; I put it on. What is this? I thought. A scraper-driven push-pull rhythm, an insistent funk pulse, declamatory chorus vocals and, occasionally emerging from this minimal but mesmerising stew, the strange combination of violin, acoustic guitar and a weird instrument that sounded like an underwater banjo, but which I later discovered to be a kamelngoni, a recent adaptation of an ancient traditional hunter&apos;s harp and the base of this extraordinary music called modern Wassoulou. And above it all that oh-so-definite and beautiful soul voice unfurling endless serpentine lines. It was the 21-year-old Oumou Sangare&apos;s debut release Moussolou (Women). Six songs, 30 minutes long. Perfect. I listened to it on repeat for weeks on end. David HarringtonKronos Quartet           Toumani Diabat\u00e9&apos;s Mande Variations is currently my favourite album from the amazing riches of Malian music. Like Bach&apos;s Goldberg Variations from nearly 300 years earlier, it&apos;s a record that manages to give the listener a vast sonic-compositional picture of musical possibilities, sets a new high-water mark for the kora as an instrumental force and at the same time is a generous tribute to the bountiful ancient tradition that Diabat\u00e9 inherited. This is music at the highest, most exalted level, coming from the centre of the incredibly deep culture of Mali as refracted through the vision of one of the world&apos;s greatest instrumentalists. BalojiRapper Mamani Keita is one of those unique voices originating from the homeland of blues music. Her songs are in the tradition of Bambara music, but at the same time they are completely in tune with our times. The 2006 album Yelema is not perfect, but she is not afraid to play with the rules of world music and to transgress them. She is like a quiet storm: she provokes and goes against the grain, without us completely noticing it. &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis Saxophonist and arranger for James Brown Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 had a unique style of guitar playing which was quite reminiscent of the blues from the deep south of America. It was quite surprising to hear that; an African guy playing blues. His album Savane has a sadness to it: very haunting, very, very beautiful. I really enjoyed working with him; he was such a pleasure to work with, a calm and sensitive artist. It came very naturally because it&apos;s such an honest form of music. I felt the spirit from him. Femi Kuti Singer and bandleader I&apos;ve come to know of Rokia Traor\u00e9 over the past couple of years. She&apos;s a very strong woman in persona, her beliefs, and in her writing \u2013 a true artist. I love the song Aimer for the soft beauty in her voice \u2013 and I love jazz and the cyclical shuffle on the track, the harmonies, the great n&apos;goni and with it being about love it&apos;s befitting to the current climate as Mali needs some serious love Jon McClureSinger with Reverend &amp; The Makers Although there are so many great Malian musicians, if I had to choose one I would pick Bassekou Kouyate. I had heard great things of him from people who had visited him at his home in Mali but nothing prepared me for seeing him live. The &quot;Jimi Hendrix of the ngoni&quot; tag is overused but rings so true. He is the master of the instrument and a total gent to boost. His record Segu Blue is a masterpiece. Angelique KidjoBeninoise singer-songwriter Exiled in Paris from my native Benin in west Africa, I started to study music in a jazz school in 1985. I could hear the passion the great jazzmen had for African music. John Coltrane had written a song called Dahomey Dance after the name of my country and it has been said that Miles Davis&apos;s modal approach in Kind of Blue was inspired by a performance of the Ballets de Guin\u00e9e that he attended. But African music in the 80s was just about dance, partying, Congolese guitars and &quot;la Sape&quot;, the Zairian form of dandyism. I was so frustrated. I could not imagine how to reconcile in my music the beauty of the traditional music of my youth with the modern sounds of jazz. Then, in 1987, came Salif Keita&apos;s album Soro. It was a grand revelation for me. In the opening of the song Sina, his most amazing voice felt like an incantation. It was surrounded by mystical minor chords and backed by the funkiest Malian polyrhythms you could imagine! The emotion it carried gave me a sense that African culture had unlimited depth and power and could also touch your heart like nothing you had heard before. Johnny MarrFormer Smiths guitarist I first heard Amadou and Mariam when I was in the band Modest Mouse and the drummer would play their first big record on the bus. It didn&apos;t surprise me that they crossed over to rock fans because there&apos;s a shared sensibility in the arrangements. I played with them at an Africa Express gig at Koko in London, and I suspect Amadou is a secret shredder \u2013 and nothing wrong with that. Put it this way: he&apos;s very into his riffs. He and I were sat in a hotel room on our own. Two electric guitars, not plugged in. Jamming. I know how to approach jamming with someone you&apos;ve never met before: there&apos;s a feeling out of space, there&apos;s an appropriate way of making it happen ... and within 20 seconds he was saying: &quot;Solo! Solo! ... Blow! Blow! Blow!&quot; I was completely unencumbered by any electricity: there was no amplifier. I wasn&apos;t plugged into anything. And he wanted me to &quot;blow&quot; like Jimi Hendrix or someone. And I recognise a guitar dude when I hear one \u2013 and he&apos;s one. There&apos;s one tune of his which sounds very like one of mine: What Difference Does It Make? In fact, I remember thinking when we were on stage playing: &quot;I guess you haven&apos;t actually nicked my riff ... in which case, we&apos;re cut from a similar cloth.&quot; I&apos;ll leave it at that! Michael NymanComposer My favourite Mali music album is Damon Albarn&apos;s Mali Music simply because I had the privilege of hanging out in Bamako during the rehearsals for the first live performance of Damon&apos;s collaborative gig at the Barbican in London in March 2002. My trip enabled me to mix with, talk to, listen to serious representatives of the Malian musical culture that is now in the process of being destroyed. The past and present memories are strong; the future is unthinkable. Spoek MathamboRapper           I first heard A Chacun Son Probl\u00e8me by Amadou &amp; Mariam on the African Express train that toured the UK last summer \u2013 with Amadou sitting and singing it by himself much as on the original recording. The world stopped for a moment. I instantly connected with the meditative, trancey qualities of the song, and although I don&apos;t understand French the sentiment cuts through my psyche and my make-believe translations make my probleme that much less problematic. To this day, A Chacun Son Probl\u00e8me takes me a very warm and special place filled with love. Romeo StodartThe Magic Numbers I&apos;ve been extremely fortunate to collaborate with Amadou and Mariam on several occasions over the years and making music together has always been a real humbling and inspiring experience. Amadou&apos;s effortless guitar playing just oozes so much soul and the chemistry between them is really infectious. My favourite record to play of theirs is a collection of early recordings from 1990\u20131995 called Le Meilleur des Ann\u00e9es Maliennes. It&apos;s really sparse, just their beautiful voices with mainly Amadou&apos;s guitar for accompaniment. It features some of the best liquid guitar playing you&apos;ll hear - I highly recommend it.  Ludovico EinaudiPianist My favorite Malian album is New Ancient Strings by Toumani Diabate and Ballake Sissoko, the best exponents of that beautiful Malian instrument, the kora. Apart from the unique atmosphere, the virtuosity of the musicians and the emotional depth what really makes special this album is also the sound being recorded in a natural acoustic. And I love it that the album is also a tribute to their respective fathers \u2013 also kora masters.            Cerys MatthewsSinger, songwriter, broadcaster I&apos;ve been in love with music coming out of Mali since I was a teenager when Ali Farka Tour\u00e9&apos;s haunting blues slinked out of a mixtape I&apos;d been given. Mali could quite easily be branded, like Wales, as a &quot;Land of Song&quot; - music seems to be in the very soil. There are so many talented artists and albums to enjoy \u2013 from Ali&apos;s Savane and Amadou and Mariam&apos;s Dimanche \u00e0 Bamako to more recent releases like Fatou Diawara&apos;s Fatou and Bassekou Kouyate&apos;s new one Jama Ko. I also love the Tel Aviv Session, a collaborative release from Mali&apos;s Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 and Isreali Idan Raichel.

A series of polls on Friday \u2013 the last day permitted for the publication of opinion surveys \u2013 showed Likud-Beiteinu likely to take 32-35 seats in the 120-place parliament. Its nearest rival, Labour, is predicted to get 16 or 17, and the extreme right Jewish Home is expected to finish third, with 11-13 seats. But around 15% of voters are undecided. If a substantial proportion of those actually vote on Tuesday, they could have a marked impact on the parties&apos; final tallies. Turnout in Israeli elections is traditionally high, although it has fallen in recent years. It is expected to be about 70% in this election. Although Likud-Beiteinu is set to be the biggest party by some distance, support for the alliance between Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party and former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman&apos;s Yisrael Beiteinu has steadily fallen during the campaign. The American election strategist Arthur Finkelstein, who advocated the merger and is advising the alliance, predicted it would win 45 seats, and polls a month ago were forecasting 39 seats. Support has drained to the ultra-nationalist, pro-settler Jewish Home, led by Netanyahu&apos;s former chief of staff Naftali Bennett, in an indication of the hardening of opinion on the right of the Israeli political spectrum. &quot;This election will likely mark an acceleration of Israel&apos;s long-predicted \u2026 journey toward a hegemonic nationalism resembling apartheid-era South Africa,&quot; wrote Daniel Levy, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, in Foreign Policy this week. Netanyahu has sought to stem the loss of votes by appealing to the pro-settler vote. He would seek a &quot;real and fair solution&quot; with the Palestinians &quot;and that certainly doesn&apos;t include driving out hundreds of thousands of Jews who live in the suburbs of Jerusalem and in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, in the Ariel bloc,&quot; he told the Jerusalem Post on Friday. Ariel is a huge settlement which juts deep into the West Bank, almost reaching the Jordan valley. Asked in an interview with the Hebrew-language Ma&apos;ariv if he would guarantee that no settlement would be uprooted in the next four years, Netanyahu said: &quot;Yes, correct. The days of bulldozers flattening settlements are behind us, not in front of us.&quot; Speculation is turning towards the complexion of the coalition government Netanyahu will assemble in the coming weeks. Most analysts expect him to form a rightwing-religious block, though he may seek to include at least one of the centrist parties to add breadth to the coalition. &quot;Israel&apos;s right wing has become more hardline, and Netanyahu is a relative moderate. He is out of kilter with much of his own party,&quot; said David Horovitz, founding editor of the Times of Israel. &quot;He would prefer another party to his left in the coalition. He will not want to be the most dovish person in his government.&quot; Labour has said it will lead the opposition rather than join a Netanyahu-led coalition. But the centrist parties Yesh Atid, led by former television personality Yair Lapid, and Hatnua, led by former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, have not ruled out becoming coalition partners. An attempt to form a centre-left alliance between these three parties, potentially capable of challenging the Likud-Beiteinu alliance, failed. The inclusion of a centrist party may help Netanyahu repair relations between the Israeli government and the Obama administration, which have been seriously strained over the past year. The Israeli elections: facts and figures \u2022 Israeli voters go to the polls on Tuesday to elect the 19th Knesset (Israeli parliament). There are 34 parties competing for 120 seats. \u2022 There are 5.1 million eligible voters in Israel, plus another 600,000 abroad. \u2022 Israel uses a kind of proportional representation, called the list system. The public votes for a party, not individuals, with the proportion of votes determining the number of seats allocated to a party. So if a party gets 10% of the popular vote, it is allocated 12 seats \u2013 and the first 12 candidates on its list become members of the Knesset. \u2022 There is a minimum threshold of 2% of the popular vote to gain a seat. \u2022 No party has ever won an overall majority, so every government in Israel&apos;s history has been a coalition. \u2022 The leader of the party with the biggest number of seats is asked to put together a coalition within 42 days. If he or she cannot, it falls to the leader of the next biggest party. Coalition horse-trading can continue for days or weeks. \u2022 Likud-Beiteinu, the rightwing political alliance led by the current prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is expected to be the biggest party. Netanyahu may seek to bring religious parties into a coalition to gain a majority, or he may seek the support of centrist parties. Or he could invite both to create a broader coalition. \u2022 Labour, expected to be the second biggest party, has said it will not join a coalition led by Likud-Beiteinu. \u2022 Opinion polls are banned in the final few days of the election campaign.", "publicationDate": "2013-01-18T15:00:22Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu on course to win Israeli elections", "sentences": ["He would seek a &quot;real and fair solution&quot; with the Palestinians &quot;and that certainly doesn&apos;t include driving out hundreds of thousands of Jews who live in the suburbs of Jerusalem and in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, in the Ariel bloc,&quot; he told the Jerusalem Post on Friday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/18/binyamin-netanyahu-israeli-elections"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israelis have begun voting in a general election that is expected to return Binyamin Netanyahu at the head of another coalition government, albeit with fewer parliamentary seats and a more rightwing, hawkish bent.

The significant drop from the current 42 seats held by the two parties is attributed largely to the draining of votes to the ultra-nationalist rightwing Jewish Home party, led by former commando and startup millionaire Naftali Bennett. Jewish Home \u2013 which is vehemently opposed to a Palestinian state and advocates the annexation of large chunks of the West Bank \u2013 is expected to become the third biggest party, with around 12 seats. But Netanyahu has also run a lacklustre campaign marked by tactical errors. The prime minister and his family cast their votes five minutes after the polls opened at 7am local time (0500 GMT). He said that despite the dry weather, he wished to see &quot;a rain of ballots&quot; for his party. &quot;The stronger Likud-Beiteinu is, the easier it will be to lead Israel successfully,&quot; he added.

Around 18% of the public had not decided which party to vote for, according to the last opinion polls to be published before the election. In theory they could dramatically change the outcome, or boost the prospects of smaller parties. There are more than 30 parties contesting the elections for the 19th Knesset. The polls close at 10pm, and 85% of the votes will be counted overnight. Turnout is expected to be around 65% of the 5.6 million eligible voters, although the proportion among Israeli Arabs \u2013 20% of the population \u2013 is likely to be lower. President Shimon Peres urged Israelis to exercise their right to vote. &quot;In 65 years of existence Israel went through seven wars but never lost its democratic freedom. We fought for our survival but never gave up our democracy. We are a unique country; neither war nor trouble can overcome freedom. Today is a celebration of that democracy,&quot; he said.

Turnout figures were on course to be the highest in more than a decade after a late surge of enthusiasm at the end of a lacklustre election campaign. Binyamin Netanyahu was still expected to win a second consecutive term as prime minister, although with a smaller mandate. The final distribution of seats won by his Likud-Beiteinu electoral alliance and its rivals on both the extreme right and the centre-left will determine the political character of the next coalition. Negotiations will begin on Wednesday and could last several weeks. A record 55.5% of Israel&apos;s 5.6 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by 6pm, with four hours of voting still to go, surprising observers who had predicted a lower turnout than in the last election, in 2009. Sunshine and unusually high temperatures encouraged voter participation. Netanyahu warned his supporters that the high numbers may benefit his opponents. &quot;Voter turnout is high, but not in traditional Likud strongholds,&quot; he said mid-afternoon. &quot;Go out and vote in order for us to be strong.&quot; Tzipi Livni, the leader of the centrist Hatnua party, said she was reminded of the huge social justice protests seen in Israel 18 months ago. &quot;Suddenly people are coming out of their homes.

Despite the possibility of last-minute swings \u2013 almost one in five voters were undecided before polling stations opened \u2013 Likud-Beiteinu was expected to emerge as the biggest party in the next parliament.

Its leader, the former commando and startup millionaire Naftali Bennett, is likely to be invited to join the next coalition. His contingent of ultra-nationalist MPs, some of whom are hardline settlers, along with a markedly more pro-settler presence in the Likud parliamentary group, is expected to bolster resistance to international pressure to halt the expansion of Israeli colonies in the West Bank. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said on Tuesday that the prospects of a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state were receding as a result of settlement expansion. &quot;I hope that whatever Israeli government emerges \u2026 that it will recognise that we are approaching the last chance to bring about such a solution,&quot; Hague told parliament. &quot;I condemn recent Israeli decisions to expand settlements. I speak regularly to Israeli leaders stressing our profound concern that Israel&apos;s settlement policy is losing it the support of the international community and will make a two-state solution impossible.&quot; He added: &quot;There is a clock ticking with potentially disastrous consequences for the peace process.&quot; Hague said the European Union and the United States were considering &quot;incentives and disincentives&quot; to encourage the parties to return to negotiations. Official election results will not be published until next week, but the president, Shimon Peres, will begin the process of selecting a party leader to assemble a coalition on Wednesday.

Right wing and allied Orthodox religious parties won half the seats in the Israeli parliament, presenting Netanyahu with a tough political challenge to put together a stable coalition. Netanyahu remains on course to continue as prime minister, as his rightwing electoral alliance, Likud-Beiteinu, is the biggest party after winning 31 of 120 seats in the next parliament. But it was a sharp drop from the present combined total of 42 for the two parties. Yesh Atid, a new centrist party led by the former television personality Yair Lapid, won 19 seats. It concentrated its election campaign on socio-economic issues and removing the exemption for military service for ultra-orthodox Jews. Netanyahu called Lapid, whose unexpected success hands him a pivotal role in coalition negotiations, as the final results came in to discuss a potential government. Likud officials quoted the Israeli prime minister as telling Lapid: &quot;We have the opportunity to do great things together&quot;. But Netanyahu was also putting out feelers to ultra-Orthodox parties which could prove vital in putting together a government, saying he would open coalition talks with them on Thursday. Final results could shift, although not dramatically, later in the week after votes from serving members of the military are counted. Two out of three Israelis voted in Tuesday&apos;s election, a slightly higher proportion than in the previous two elections, surprising observers who had predicted a fall in turnout. In a speech at his election headquarters in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said: &quot;I believe the election results are an opportunity to make changes that the citizens of Israel are hoping for and that will serve all of Israel&apos;s citizens. I intend on leading these changes, and to this end we must form as wide a coalition as possible, and I have already begun talks to that end this evening.&quot;  Lapid told campaign workers in Tel Aviv: &quot;We must now \u2026 find the way to work together to find real solutions for real people. I call on the leaders of the political establishment to work with me together, to the best they can, to form as broad a government as possible that will contain in it the moderate forces from the left and right, the right and left, so that we will truly be able to bring about real change.&quot; Dov Lipman, who won a seat for Yesh Atid, said: &quot;This is a very clear statement that the people of Israel want to see a different direction. We will get the country back on track.&quot; Labour was the third largest party, with 15 seats. Party leader Shelly Yachimovich said in a statement: &quot;There is no doubt we are watching a political drama unfold before our eyes \u2026 There is a high chance of a dramatic change, and of the end of the Netanyahu coalition.&quot; She said she intended to attempt to &quot;form a coalition on an economic-social basis that will also push the peace process forward.&quot; It seems unlikely Yachimovich could present a credible alternative to Netanyahu&apos;s claim to the premiership. Erel Margalit of Labour said the results indicated &quot;a protest vote against Netanyahu&quot; and that the huge social justice protests that swept Israel 18 months ago &quot;were not a fringe phenomena. Perhaps some of it is moving from the streets into the political arena&quot;. The ultra-nationalist Jewish Home, which showed strongly in opinion polls during the campaign, was at 11 seats, the same as the ultra-orthodox party Shas. The leftist party Meretz made an unexpectedly strong showing, with six seats, more than doubling its current presence. Speculation about the composition of the next coalition government intensified as the results came in. Israel&apos;s electoral system of proportional representation has ensured no single party has gained an absolute majority since the creation of the state almost 65 years ago. Negotiations are expected to last several weeks. As the leader of the biggest party, Netanyahu will be first in line to assemble a coalition. Although Netanyahu&apos;s natural partners are the smaller rightwing and religious parties, he is likely to be keen to include Yesh Atid and possibly Hatnua, which is led by former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and won seven seats. However, Livni&apos;s insistence on a return to meaningful negotiations with the Palestinians could deter Netanyahu from inviting her join him. Three parties mostly supported by Israeli Arabs had 12 seats between them. Although they are regarded as part of the left bloc in the Knesset, it is unlikely they would be part of any coalition government. Yehuda Ben Meir of the Institute of National Security Studies, said: &quot;The story of this election is a slight move to the centre, and above all the possibility of Netanyahu forming a coalition only with his &apos;natural partners&apos; does not exist. He is definitely going to work for a wider coalition.&quot; According to Ari Shavit of the liberal newspaper Haaretz, Netanyahu had failed to consolidate or advance his party&apos;s position. &quot;While in the past he was given poor cards and played them well, this time he had the best cards and played them badly. This was a lesson in how not to run a campaign.&quot; Kadima, which was the biggest party in the last parliament with 28 seats, saw its support plummet and only just crossed the threshold of votes needed to win two seats, according to the partial results. In Washington, the Obama administration said it is waiting to see the make up of the new government and its policies on peace with the Palestinians. But the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said there would be no change in US policy. &quot;The United States remains committed, as it has been for a long time, to working with the parties to press for the goal of a two-state solution. That has not changed and it will not change,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2013-01-23T07:45:00Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu suffers setback as centrists gain ground in Israel election", "sentences": ["In a speech at his election headquarters in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said: &quot;I believe the election results are an opportunity to make changes that the citizens of Israel are hoping for and that will serve all of Israel&apos;s citizens.", "I intend on leading these changes, and to this end we must form as wide a coalition as possible, and I have already begun talks to that end this evening.&quot;  Lapid told campaign workers in Tel Aviv: &quot;We must now \u2026 find the way to work together to find real solutions for real people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/israel-elections-binyamin-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "Israeli voters delivered a painful blow to Binyamin Netanyahu in Tuesday&apos;s election, and halted the country&apos;s worrying drift to the far right. The incumbent prime minister is likely to keep his job but his political bloc failed to put the expansion of West Bank settlements on top of the national agenda, and to sacrifice civil rights in favour of majority rule. The election&apos;s rising star, Yair Lapid, positioned himself as Israel&apos;s new kingmaker and will be the key player in the next governing coalition. Lapid promised his voters one thing: normality \u2013 to live in Israel as if you&apos;re living in western Europe or North America, with a government that worries about education, housing and economic opportunity, rather than Iran&apos;s nuclear programme or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Midway through his recent four-year term &quot;Bibi&quot;, the supposed master politician, lost touch with the Israeli public. Lacking a rival who could challenge his power, he behaved like a monopolist, ignoring the customers. Viewing himself as the saviour of the Jewish people from the wrath of Iran&apos;s atomic bombs \u2013 as the Israeli reincarnation of his hero, Winston Churchill \u2013 Netanyahu behaved like the king of Judea. He stayed on this message during the campaign, which showed his image under the hollow slogan &quot;A strong prime minister for a strong Israel&quot;, but failed to draft a platform. Rather than engaging the public, Netanyahu made a deal with Avigdor Lieberman, his then foreign minister, to merge their parties for the election. This sealed his victory, but further alienated the voters. The public wasn&apos;t satisfied with Netanyahu&apos;s attitude, and in the summer of 2011 sent a powerful warning sign to the prime minister. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis marched in the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities in an unprecedented middle-class revolt against the rising cost of living, and of property in particular. Netanyahu responded by appointing a committee and burying the issue, while arranging a prisoner exchange with Hamas, which brought Gilad Shalit back home from captivity in Gaza. The gambit propelled his popularity for a while, but failed to address the protest&apos;s\u00a0underlying causes. The protesters did not seek to oust Netanyahu. They wanted an improved, more attentive, more compassionate Bibi. And they brought to the fore two journalists-turned-politicians: Shelly Yachimovich, who won the Labour party chairmanship, and Lapid, who formed a new centrist party, Yesh Atid (There Is a Future). The two former television celebrities argued that they understand the public mind better than the old guard of Netanyahu and his ilk. In their analysis, Israelis couldn&apos;t care less about the Palestinian issue and the settlements. Instead they crave economic security and better education. In his weekly newspaper column \u2013 which was the most widely read in Israel \u2013 and his talk shows, Lapid defined the Israeli mainstream and became its voice. His agenda is full of apparent contradictions: nationalist and admiring the military but seeing Israel as part of the west and its culture. Secular and seeking to break the ultra-orthodox educational autonomy, draft exemption and political power, but respecting Jewish tradition. Supporting the two-state solution, but mistrusting the Palestinian leadership. Identifying with the middle class &quot;slaves&quot; while driving a luxury car. Putting education on top, without having even a high-school diploma. Between both newcomers, Yachimovich had an early edge over Lapid. But he ran an exemplary campaign, careful not to lose steam over useless fights or to alienate his supporters \u2013 while Yachimovich turned her back on her party&apos;s peace legacy in a futile effort to win voters from the right. Lapid&apos;s achievement is all the more remarkable considering his zero military or political experience. He simply gave his voters what they wanted to hear. Which raises the key question in the wake of Tuesday&apos;s result: can you really live in Tel Aviv and feel like it&apos;s Berlin, with no occupation and settlements barely 20 minutes away? Can Israel isolate itself behind wire and concrete and fix its education and welfare, as if the Palestinians don&apos;t exist? It sounds good in a campaign, but disconnected from real life. And therefore Lapid&apos;s test\u00a0will be in his ability to pull Netanyahu towards a moderate foreign policy, and not to accept empty pledges of constitutional and social reform in return for sustaining Likud. Coalition talks are the endgame of Israeli elections, and the political rookie Lapid now awaits a tough poker game with the master of survival, Netanyahu. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2013-01-23T18:04:00Z", "title": "Can Netanyahu survive Israel's middle-class revolt? | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["Hundreds of thousands of Israelis marched in the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities in an unprecedented middle-class revolt against the rising cost of living, and of property in particular.", "Which raises the key question in the wake of Tuesday&apos;s result: can you really live in Tel Aviv and feel like it&apos;s Berlin, with no occupation and settlements barely 20 minutes away?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/23/netanyahu-israel-middle-class-yair-lapid"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Hezbollah", "Iran"], "article": "Israel faces threats of retaliation after Wednesday&apos;s bombing on the Syrian-Lebanese border, with Russia and the Arab League describing it as a violation of Syria&apos;s sovereignty. Syria and Iran threatened to respond to the military intervention, which was widely ascribed to Israeli forces. Warplanes targeted a &quot;scientific research centre&quot; near Damascus, according to Syrian state television. Other reports said a convoy believed to be carrying Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles across the border to Hezbollah in Lebanon was struck. The Israeli military declined to comment. A spokesman for the Arab League said the bombing was a &quot;glaring violation&quot; of Syria&apos;s sovereignty. The &quot;silence of the international community about Israel&apos;s bombing of Syrian sites in the past encouraged it to carry out the new aggression, taking advantage of political and security deterioration in Syria,&quot; Nabil al-Arabi, the league&apos;s head, said. The Russian foreign ministry said: &quot;If this information is confirmed, then we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets on the territory of a sovereign country, which blatantly violates the UN charter and is unacceptable, no matter the motives to justify it.&quot; Hezbollah, the Lebanese Islamic militia, pledged full solidarity with the Syrian regime, saying Israel had &quot;perpetrated a barbaric attack&quot;.&quot;In line with its inherent spirit of aggression and criminality, and in accordance with its policy of preventing any Arab or Islamic power from developing technological and military capabilities, Israel perpetrated a barbaric attack against a Syrian installation for scientific research on Syrian territory, causing the death of a number of Syrians, the injury of others, and the destruction of the installation,&quot; the Hezbollah statement read. Two people were killed and five wounded in the attack, according to Syrian state television. The Syrian ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Abdul-Karim, said Damascus retained &quot;the option... to retaliate&quot;. The Iranian deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, was quoted as saying the attack would have significant implications for Tel Aviv, which is within range of Hezbollah rockets. The US administration was warned of the attack, according to the New York Times. Israel continued to maintain an official silence on the air strike, following a pattern of previous military interventions attributed to its forces. Some analysts said this was to minimise the likelihood of retaliatory action. &quot;Clearly someone attacked something on the Syrian-Lebanese border,&quot; said military expert Yossi Alpher. &quot;But it&apos;s extremely important in these situations that Israel does everything possible to avoid being accredited with these actions. There&apos;s a danger of retaliatory action, whether by Syria or Hezbollah.&quot; Alpher said he was &quot;not in the least surprised&quot; by the attack. In the past few days, high-level Israeli emissaries have been despatched to Washington and Moscow, while warnings that weapons, both chemical and conventional, could reach Hezbollah or jihadists inside Syria had become more shrill.&quot;Anyone who puts two and two together is likely to come to this conclusion [that Israel was responsible],&quot; Alpher said. Gerald Steinberg, of the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies, said Israel&apos;s political, military and intelligence leadership would have made calculations about the risks of retaliation before ordering air strikes. &quot;This is a government that is very focused on rational cost-benefit analyses. There is no question in my mind that they would have calculated the risks. The costs of not acting would be deemed to be greater than the potential repercussions,&quot; he said. Israel, he added, had &quot;not acted nor spoken publicly about the upheaval in Syria for almost two years. If something has changed, it&apos;s because something has changed on the ground.&quot; Amid confusion over the target or targets of the air strike, reports suggested that a convoy carrying conventional weapons, most likely Russian-made SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles, from Syria to Hezbollah depots in Lebanon was targeted. &quot;These are game-changing weapons,&quot; said Miri Eisin, a former Israeli military intelligence officer. Syria, she said, had received cutting-edge military hardware from Russia, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles. &quot;These are some of the most advanced technologies. If they go to Hezbollah - a non-state terror actor on Israel&apos;s border - that&apos;s a game-changer. Then you are going to prefer pre-emptive action.&quot; The pre-dawn air strike on the Syrian-Lebanese border closely followed reports of intensive sorties by Israeli military planes. United Nations forces on the Israel-Lebanon border &quot;recorded a high number of Israeli overflights throughout the day and the night&quot;, UN spokesman Andrea Tenenti told the Guardian. UN forces had no evidence of illegal weapons or increased Hezbollah presence in their area of operations, close to the border with Israel. &quot;We haven&apos;t seen any suspicious activities in the south,&quot; he said.Israel is widely believed to be behind previous attacks that it never publicly acknowledged. In 2007 Israel was accused of destroying a site in Syria that was believed to be a nuclear reactor under construction. Syria claimed it was a non-nuclear military site. Israeli fighter planes are believed to have carried out an air strike on an arms factory in Khartoum last October and an attack on an arms convoy in 2009, also in Sudan, in which scores of people were killed. Both were thought to be aimed at preventing the manufacture or transport of weapons to Hamas in Gaza.", "publicationDate": "2013-01-31T16:56:00Z", "title": "Israel faces repercussions of air strike on Syria", "sentences": ["The Iranian deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, was quoted as saying the attack would have significant implications for Tel Aviv, which is within range of Hezbollah rockets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/31/israel-air-strike-syria-repercussions"}, {"tags": ["Harry Redknapp", "QPR", "Chelsea", "Barclays", "Fifa", "Beitar Jerusalem", "Race issues", "Corinthians", "Football politics", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Prudence: man of the week  Harry Redknapp \u2013 easing up on his pre-window pledge to stay frugal and stop QPR owner Tony Fernandes &quot;having his pants taken down&quot; on wages.

On the desk a jar of sweets, still wrapped in gold foil, had melted into a sticky clump. Charred team photographs were scattered over the floor amid singed football shirts. Memorabilia from Beitar Jerusalem football club&apos;s 77-year history had been housed in the office. &quot;It&apos;s all gone, all our history is gone,&quot; said one of the staff sweeping scorched detritus into plastic sacks, pausing to draw on a cigarette and shaking his head in dismay. A blaze at 5am on Friday at Beitar&apos;s premises was probably ignited by burning material pushed through a high window facing outside the grounds. Police said evidence suggested it had been a deliberate arson attack. &quot;We&apos;re looking into possible connections with recent decisions by the management,&quot; said spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. He was referring to the signing last month of two Chechen players, a move that has plunged Beitar into a national and international furore and triggered widespread calls to rein in the virulent racism of a hard core of fans. The problem for these Beitar supporters is not that the new players are Chechens; it is that they are Muslim.           Beitar, the only Israeli club to have never signed a player from the 20% of the country&apos;s population that is Arab, has a long history of racism among its supporters, with a favourite chant being &quot;Death to Arabs&quot;. Before the arrival of Gabriel Kadiev and Zaur Sadayev, fans held aloft a banner at a match reading: &quot;Beitar forever pure.&quot; Since joining the club, the two players have been verbally abused and spat at. They have been forced to travel to and from training under police and private security guard protection. A Beitar supporter \u2013 one of four later arrested and charged \u2013 turned up at the training ground wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot;Mohammed is 100% dead&quot;. Beitar&apos;s owner, Arcadia Gaydamak, refused to bow to the fans&apos; pressure. &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no difference between a Jewish player and a Muslim player,&quot; he said. His stance, however, was weakened by coach Eli Cohen who drew a distinction between European and Arab Muslims, saying: &quot;The fans here have a problem with Arabs living in the Middle East.&quot; Condemnation of the hardcore fans&apos; behaviour has been swift and harsh. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Friday&apos;s apparent arson attack was &quot;shameful&quot;, adding: &quot;The Jewish people, [who have] suffered boycotts and persecution, should be a light unto other nations.&quot; Beitar&apos;s manager, Itzhik Kornfein, told Israel Radio on Friday: &quot;This has gone beyond sports and this has ramifications for Israeli society and for how we look to the world.&quot; Earlier, President Shimon Peres said the entire country was shocked, and former prime minister Ehud Olmert, a Beitar fan for more than 40 years, said that he would no longer attend matches because of fans&apos; behaviour. &quot;Ultimately, this is a matter that concerns all of us. Either we remove this group of racists from our field and cut it off from the team, or we are all like them. Until that happens, I will not go to games,&quot; he wrote. Israel&apos;s attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, said police would take action against any &quot;manifestation of [racism] that crosses the line into a criminal act&quot;. The Israeli Football Association imposed a 50,000 shekels (\u00a38,595) fine on the club for the racist slogans of its fans and ordered the closure of the eastern stand of its stadium, where hardcore fans congregate, for five matches. Some commentators have decried these punitive actions as inadequate. Now attention is focused on Beitar&apos;s match this evening against Bnei Sakhnin, the only top division team from an Israeli-Arab town and regarded with sporting pride by Israel&apos;s Arab minority. There is a history of animosity towards Bnei Sakhnin among Beitar fans; its players are regularly taunted as &quot;terrorists&quot;. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli-Arab member of parliament, said he would attend the match under police guard. &quot;Every time I go to a Beitar match, they shout at me &apos;Ahmed Tibi is a terrorist&apos; and other offensive things.&quot; He described Beitar as &quot;the most racist club in the world. No other club bans players on ethnic grounds.&quot; Bnei Sakhnin, he said, promoted coexistence in sport, with a handful of Jewish players. &quot;Jews and Arabs are playing together. It is the total opposite of Beitar.&quot; Amid heightened tension, Jerusalem police say there will be a heavy security presence before, during and after the match, including undercover units, mounted police and crowd-control specialists. They will be particularly anxious to avoid a repeat of a violent rampage last March by several hundred Beitar fans at a shopping mall close to the city&apos;s Teddy stadium, in which Palestinian staff and customers were abused and assaulted. No one was arrested. That was blamed on a nucleus of extremist Beitar fans, known as La Familia. The group, created in 2005, routinely make monkey noises at black players and chant anti-Islamic and anti-Arab slogans at games. They reportedly booed during a minute of silence for the assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and have been accused of assaulting Palestinian maintenance staff at the club&apos;s grounds. They have also verbally abused Kornfein, Beitar&apos;s manager, for speaking out against racism in football. A day or so before the Chechen players&apos; arrival, one of their number told an Israeli paper: &quot;I&apos;m a racist. I hate Arabs \u2026 If they bring in Muslims, the fans will burn down the club. That can&apos;t happen. Arabs and Beitar Jerusalem don&apos;t mix.&quot; At Beitar&apos;s grounds, hours after the office was torched, club supporter Yaniv Pesso, 43, denounced La Familia. &quot;They are stupid. They are a very small number, like a little mafia, but they have a big voice.&quot; Sport, politics and religion should not be mixed up, he said. &quot;I don&apos;t like Muslims, but sport is sport.&quot; Beitar, however, is not just about sport. In Israel, football clubs have always been associated with political parties or movements, and Beitar&apos;s alignment is with the nationalist right. Its name is shared with a Zionist youth movement linked in the 1940s to Herut, a rightwing party founded by Menachem Begin, which later merged into today&apos;s ruling Likud party, led by Netanyahu. Its fans are predominantly Mizrahi Jews, who came to Israel from other countries in the Middle East and north Africa, and who have always felt excluded from and shunned by the Ashkenazi \u2013 or eastern European \u2013 elite. Mizrahi Jews make up about 40% of Israel&apos;s 8 million population. In contrast to Beitar, for example, Hapoel Tel Aviv, a club based in Israel&apos;s most liberal city, is still associated with the historic workers&apos; movement and today&apos;s political left \u2013 and Ashkenazi Jews. In the mid-1970s, Beitar won its first national championship and Likud became Israel&apos;s ruling party for the first time, with Begin becoming prime minister. Rightwing nationalism, both on the terraces and in parliament, was ascendant. According to Avraham Burg, a former speaker of the Israeli parliament, the club should be viewed from three perspectives. &quot;The small picture is that every football club has a group of very extreme fans who are fanatical about the spirit of the club. The spirit of Beitar is interpreted by this group as ethnic, religious, racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic. &quot;The mid-sized picture is that of Jerusalem. These days it is a narrow-minded, limited, self-confined city, where the two communities [Jewish and Arab] are separated. &quot;The big picture means asking if this is a symbol of a larger problem in Israel. The answer is definitely yes. It&apos;s a combination of racism and xenophobia, but a racism that is connected to religious extremism.&quot; But Tamar Herman of the Israeli Democracy Institute said the racism of Beitar&apos;s fans was not representative or typical of Israeli society. &quot;Football clubs develop a certain subculture that does not necessarily reflect the entire society around them,&quot; she said. Anti-Arab feeling in Israel, she added, was different from European Islamophobia. &quot;It&apos;s based on a conflict of interests. It&apos;s not because they are Arab or Muslim, but because of a constant struggle over ownership of the land. In Europe, Islamophobia is not based on a political, historical and military conflict.&quot; Back at Beitar&apos;s grounds, where the club&apos;s junior team was practising penalty shots in the afternoon sun, manager Barbara Barashi said she was ashamed by the apparent arson attack. &quot;I don&apos;t want people to think we&apos;re all like that. I teach the boys that everyone is equal.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-02-10T00:06:06Z", "title": "Israelis shocked by racist football chants bringing shame to a once proud team", "sentences": ["In contrast to Beitar, for example, Hapoel Tel Aviv, a club based in Israel&apos;s most liberal city, is still associated with the historic workers&apos; movement and today&apos;s political left \u2013 and Ashkenazi Jews."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/10/beitar-jerusalem-counts-cost-arson"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "For decades, it seemed as though one of the world&apos;s smallest religious communities was doomed. Dwindling and insular, the Samaritans of Mount Gerizim were struggling to survive as inbreeding produced generation after generation of children with serious disabilities on an isolated hilltop in the biblical landscape of the West Bank. But the threat of extinction is now receding after the deployment of the twin weapons of advanced medical science and internet marriage agencies to import brides from Ukraine. In fact, the community of four extended families totalling 320 people is now looking forward to rapid growth. &quot;We&apos;re hoping our numbers will reach 10,000 in 10 years,&quot; jokes high priest Aharon Ben-Av Chisda, with more optimism than realistic prediction. &quot;Before, we were worried about the future of our community. Now we have hope.&quot; Much of this hope stems from five young Ukrainian women who have injected fresh blood to Mount Gerizim after swapping a life of bleak prospects, dismal housing and badly paid employment for space, security and strict observance of the religious dictates of the ancient Samaritan community. Alla Altif, 25, the third bride to make the journey from the shores of the Black Sea to the hills of the West Bank, had &quot;no idea what to expect.

The women, located by specialist internet-based agencies, have converted from Christianity in order to join the community, whose members are forbidden from marrying non-Samaritans. The brides now adhere to strict biblical traditions, including isolation during menstruation and for long periods following childbirth. The Samaritans \u2013 who share many beliefs and practices with Judaism, as well as marked differences \u2013 peaked at around a million during the Roman era. But their numbers fell dramatically as a result of bloody rebellions and forced conversion to Islam. By the early part of the 20th century there were fewer than 150 left.

But in a shrinking community reluctant to accept converts, inbreeding had catastrophic consequences. Marriage between first cousins was extremely common, leading to a high incidence of serious birth defects and genetic illnesses. In the 1990s, when the Samaritans at Mount Gerizim were granted Israeli citizenship, they gained access to Israel&apos;s hi-tech hospitals, among the most advanced in the world. Routine genetic testing was introduced in the pregnancies of Samaritan women, and abortions were encouraged whenever the risk of birth defects was higher than 10%. Around one in five pregnancies is now terminated, and in the past 15 years, only two disabled children have been born \u2013 one as a result of oxygen deprivation during labour, and the other a child whose parents failed to complete the full range of tests during pregnancy. &quot;Genetic testing has vastly improved things,&quot; says Ben-Av Chisda, who presides over the Mount Gerizim community and another, 450-strong, in Holon, Israel. It came too late for the 86-year-old high priest, whose wife is a second cousin. They had four children: three were deaf mutes, and one was unable to walk. The beneficiaries are a younger generation, who include Benyooda Altif, 33, and his first cousin, Mazal, 35, who married seven years ago and have a healthy six-year-old son. But Mazal&apos;s second pregnancy, another boy, was terminated after a blood-clotting problem was discovered. &quot;It felt like I lost someone I knew,&quot; says Benyooda. &quot;I had something black in my heart.&quot; The couple are trying for another baby. But, says Mazal, &quot;I&apos;m afraid there&apos;ll be something wrong again. The abortion was emotionally very hard.&quot; Her distress was compounded by having to &quot;sit on my own&quot; for 40 days following the termination. The Samaritan religion dictates that women must sleep separately from their husbands, wear special clothes and eat from separate plates for seven days following the start of menstruation, 40 days following the birth of a boy and 80 days after the birth of a girl. Abortion is governed by the same rule as birth.     A Samaritan mother and her childrren make a Passover pilgrimage to their holy mountain last May. Photograph: Maya Levin for the Guardian    This isolation was the one thing that Alla Altif found difficult to adjust to after joining the community in November 2010. &quot;When I have my period, no one can touch me. If I hold my child, then he is unclean, and I have to bathe him before he can touch his father. The separation is hard. Everything else was easy \u2013 I just had to\u00a0learn the rules and follow them.&quot; Her husband, Uzi \u2013 who is Mazal&apos;s uncle \u2013 made contact with her through an agency based in Israel. He visited her home in Kherson, where she worked in a bar, in June 2010. &quot;We met in a cafe, and talked through a translator. We met every day for a week, and then we decided to marry. It was an emotional decision, but I was ready for it. I wasn&apos;t afraid \u2013 I am a risk-taker by nature,&quot; she says. They married immediately in a civil ceremony. A week later, Uzi returned to Mount Gerizim, and Alla remained in Kherson to complete the paperwork for her emigration. She was already pregnant. The couple married again, in a religious ceremony. Alla learned Hebrew and some Arabic \u2013 members of the community speak both languages \u2013 and quickly adapted to being a full-time mother in a large extended family. &quot;I\u00a0never felt alone here,&quot; she says. &quot;These people have open souls. I am surrounded by warmth and love.&quot; Samaritans in the Israeli town of Holon, south of Tel Aviv, have also accepted 15 brides into their community, half from Ukraine and half local Jewish women. Life in the urban sprawl of Israel&apos;s most populous area is less of a culture shock than the rolling hills of the northern West Bank, scattered with hardline Israeli settlements and densely populated Palestinian cities and towns. The children of Mount Gerizim, perched above the Palestinian city of Nablus, attend local Palestinian schools, and are brought up to be bilingual in Arabic and Hebrew. Each member of the community has both an Arabic and a Hebrew name. The community is proud of this: &quot;We don&apos;t lean to either side. We are peace-loving people who want to be neutral,&quot; says Benyooda. His brother is now &quot;looking for a Ukrainian girl to marry&quot;, he says. Alla has already made one introduction between a Samaritan man and a friend back home, which resulted in a marriage; others may follow. &quot;We are opening our arms to anyone who wants to join our faith,&quot; says Ben-Av Chisda. &quot;These women who came didn&apos;t come because they fell in love, but because they wanted to become part of our faith. Now they practise our religion even more than our own women.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-02-11T08:00:00Z", "title": "How Ukrainian women saved the Samaritans of Mount Gerizim", "sentences": ["I am surrounded by warmth and love.&quot; Samaritans in the Israeli town of Holon, south of Tel Aviv, have also accepted 15 brides into their community, half from Ukraine and half local Jewish women."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/ukrainian-women-samaritans-mount-gerizim"}, {"tags": ["Media", "News agencies", "Reuters", "New Zealand", "Human rights"], "article": "My friend and former colleague Colin Bickler, who has died aged 78 after a short illness, was associated with City University London for 20 years.

The man&apos;s identity became the subject of intense speculation when he was reportedly found hanged in his cell in 2010, but the prisoner&apos;s existence has never been officially acknowledged by Israel&apos;s government, which has gone to extraordinary lengths to stifle media coverage of the case. Now, however, new evidence has been uncovered by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that strongly suggests Prisoner X was an Australian citizen, Ben Zygier, whom it described a Mossad agent. Although there has been no intimation of the accusations against Zygier, commentators have suggested it could only suggest the most serious kind of security case, perhaps involving treason. In the immediate aftermath of ABC&apos;s claims, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office had called &quot;an emergency meeting of the Editors Committee \u2026 to ask its members to co-operate with the government and withhold publication of information pertaining to an incident that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency&quot;. Later in the day the gagging orders were explicitly linked to the claims about the dead Australian by several Israeli MPs who also raised questions about the affair during a debate in the Knesset. Asked by an Arab MP about &quot;reports [of the suicide of] an Australian citizen who was in Israeli custody under a different identity&quot;, the justice minister, Yaakov Ne&apos;eman, replied: &quot;I cannot answer these questions because the matter does not fall under the authority of the justice minister. But there is no doubt that if true, the matter must be looked into.&quot; A second MP, Dov Henin, asked: &quot;Are there people in prisons whose incarceration is kept secret? What are the supervision mechanisms on this kind of imprisonment? What are the possibilities for parliamentary supervision on such incarcerations? How can the public be critical in this situation?&quot; A new documentary screened this week for ABC&apos;s Foreign Correspondent programme claims Zygier used the name Ben Alon or Ben Allen after moving to Israel. He was secretly imprisoned in Ayalon prison in Ramla in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, ABC reported. The 34-year-old was married to an Israeli woman and was the father of two young children. He had reportedly spent a number of months in the cell before his death. Zygier&apos;s father Geoffrey, a prominent leader of the Melbourne Jewish community, apparently refused to speak to the programme makers. The only comparable case that has come to light was Israel&apos;s secret imprisonment for more than 10 years of the KGB spy Marcus Klingberg after he was tried under a false identity. Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs and trade (Dfat) on Wednesday launched a review into how its diplomats handled the case. The review, to be conducted by the department&apos;s secretary, Peter Varghese, was announced after it became known that certain department officers had been made aware in 2010 that Zygier was being held in jail in Israel but did not pass the information on. &quot;Dfat had [originally] advised that it was unaware of Mr Allen&apos;s detention in Israel,&quot; a department spokesman said. &quot;Dfat has now advised that some officers of the department were made aware of Mr Allen&apos;s detention at the time in 2010 by another Australian agency.&quot; Earlier the foreign minister, Bob Carr, had said consul officials were not aware of the man&apos;s circumstances until his parents asked for help in bringing his body back to Australia. Under normal circumstances foreign embassies are advised if one of their nationals is being held in prison. The case of Prisoner X first came to international attention in a flurry of stories in 2010. Coverage talked about the existence of an unidentified man being held in conditions of absolute secrecy for an undisclosed crime, which prompted a media guessing-game over his identity, with some speculating he was an Iranian general. According to accounts at the time, even his guards were not aware of the prisoner&apos;s identity or the crime he had allegedly committed. Debate over the existence of Prisoner X was shortlived, however, with the story disappearing from the Haaretz website. Speculation that the Israeli government had imposed a media blackout prompted Dan Yakir, the chief legal counsel with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, to write to the country&apos;s attorney general and demand that the &quot;blackout be eliminated&quot;. On Monday Haaretz printed a heavily pixellated image of what it said was the original document enforcing a reporting ban. The existence of the blackout appeared to be confirmed by the call for a reporting ban in the immediate aftermath of the Australian report. According to ABC, circumstantial evidence for its identification of Zygier was provided by the repatriation of his body to Melbourne from Tel Aviv a week after Prisoner X was allegedly found hanged in his cell. The programme claimed that Zygier had a second passport in the name of Ben Allen at the time of the repatriation of his body. Commenting on ABC&apos;s disclosures, the Australian foreign minister, Bob Carr, said he was concerned by the claims. &quot;Those allegations certainly do trouble me,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s never been raised with me. I&apos;m not reluctant to seek an explanation from the Israeli government about what happened to Mr Allen and about what their view of it is. The difficulty is I&apos;m advised we&apos;ve had no contact with his family [and] there&apos;s been no request for consular assistance during the period it&apos;s alleged he was in prison. &quot;Even if Prisoner X has now been identified, his crime remains a mystery although it has been widely speculated that it would have involved treachery to warrant such extreme measures.&quot; Details of one of two gagging orders acquired by the Israeli government have been disclosed to the Guardian . Israel first sought to prevent reporting of the case in an injunction it sought in March 2010. A second &quot;clarifying order&quot; was issued by Judge Hila Gerstel of the central district court, making clear that the reporting ban referred to all Israeli media and preventing any discussion of the man who had been referred to variously as &quot;Prisoner X&quot;, &quot;Mr X&quot; or &quot;cell 15 in Ayalon prison&quot;. The court&apos;s involvement on two different occasions suggests some kind of judicial oversight of the case, but neither the man&apos;s identity nor the charges he was facing were made clear. Bill van Esveld, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the case raised serious questions about fundamental prisoners&apos; rights including lack of due process, what information was given to the man&apos;s family and rights of consular access under international treaty obligations. &quot;We only know the absolute bare bones of this case. We know that there was some kind of gagging order and it would be almost unheard of to involve a judge to silence a story that had no basis in truth. &quot;The main concern is over the fact that a person cannot simply be disappeared. That is against the norms of international law. That person&apos;s family needs to know what has happened to them. They have to be able to have access to a defence attorney and their government needs to be informed to permit consular access.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T06:12:00Z", "title": "Israel's 'Prisoner X' was Australian Mossad agent, documentary claims", "sentences": ["According to ABC, circumstantial evidence for its identification of Zygier was provided by the repatriation of his body to Melbourne from Tel Aviv a week after Prisoner X was allegedly found hanged in his cell."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/12/israel-prisoner-x-australian-mossad-agent"}, {"tags": ["The Mossad", "Israel", "World news", "Australia news", "Espionage", "Melbourne"], "article": "Extraordinary new details emerged on Wednesday about the alleged double life of Ben Zygier \u2013 known as &quot;Prisoner X&quot; \u2013 an Australian-Israeli national and reported Mossad agent, who died after being secretly detained in an Israeli prison in 2010. In the midst of an escalating diplomatic storm over the 34-year-old&apos;s treatment and the revelation that he was being investigated by Australian authorities as a suspected Israeli agent who used Australian passports for operations, it emerged that he was confronted shortly before his arrest by an Australian journalist who accused him of being a spy. As the scandal over Zygier&apos;s suicide, while being held incommunicado in Ayalon prison, continued to grow in Israel and Australia, it was also revealed by Australian news organisations that he was under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation [ASIO] as one of three citizens suspected of using of Australian passports on behalf of Mossad. More details of the case emerged as the Israeli government partially lifted its blanket ban on reporting any details of Zygier&apos;s imprisonment, first imposed by an Israeli court after his arrest. Zygier, who was married to an Israeli and had two young children, was found hanged in his cell in late 2010. His body was flown to Melbourne for burial the following week. In Israel the case has triggered demands by opposition politicians, human rights groups and the media for Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s government to supply more information about the man&apos;s imprisonment and death, and to reform its antiquated and authoritarian military censorship rules. When the story about Prisoner X first emerged, Israeli media said the unidentified man was being held incommunicado at Ayalon high-security prison in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. While the case remains deeply murky, the new revelations will be deeply embarrassing to Mossad, not least because they have lifted the lid again on how the Israeli spy agencies acquire cover identities for agents. In the last three years the Mossad department charged with providing cover identities has been caught out in a series of high-profile bungles as it has been found to have been improperly using foreign passports for its operations. The details came only a day after an ABC documentary revealed Prisoner X&apos;s identity for the first time, and after ham-fisted efforts by Netanyahu&apos;s office to prevent reporting of the story by Israeli media messily backfired. According to The Age, Zygier had applied for Australian passports using three identities over the years \u2013 those of Ben Alon, Ben Allen and Benjamin Burrows. The new details about Australian suspicions that Zygier was a Mossad agent came as the Australian government was forced to backtrack on claims that it had no knowledge of his arrest and to admit that Israeli officials had briefed Australian diplomats over the case. There has still been no official explanation for why Zygier was secretly imprisoned without trial, and information on his case ruthlessly suppressed. But speculation is growing that he may have offered to provide information to a foreign power. It is still not clear whether Zygier was actively working for Mossad, or whether he simply acquired passports for the spy agency to use in its overseas operations. According to The Age, Zygier had been approached by a Fairfax journalist after being tipped off that the Australian intelligence agency ASIO was investigating three dual national citizens who had emigrated to Israel, on suspicion that the men had used Australian passports to spy for Israel in Iran, Syria and Lebanon \u2013 which is illegal under Australian law. Zygier, known as Benji, was approached by the reporter Jason Koutsoukis shortly before his arrest in 2010 and asked whether he was an Israeli spy after being accused of travelling back to Australia to change his name and obtain a new Australian passport. At the time Zygier said: &quot;I have never been to any of those countries that you say I have been to, I am not involved in any kind of spying. That is ridiculous.&quot; In recent years the issue of both Mossad operations involving citizens of friendly nations and use of passports of allies, has become a source of serious friction with governments usually friendly with Israel. &quot;There are informal rules,&quot; said one person familiar with intelligence co-operation arrangements. &quot;You inform your allies if you want to speak to someone or do something. There is a feeling the Israelis don&apos;t play by the rules.&quot; Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports became an international scandal not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and detention when it was revealed that the spy agency had used almost a dozen foreign passports in its assassination of Hamas&apos;s Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel, in January 2010. In seven cases it turned out that the passports used were in the name of Jews who had immigrated to Israel from Britain and Germany and had no knowledge that someone using their identity had visited Dubai. At around the same time it emerged that the Australian intelligence service was investigating the use of identities of at least three Australians. In a further development deeply embarrassing for the Canberra government the Australia foreign minister, Bob Carr, was forced to revise his claims that the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv knew nothing of the case until after Zygier died in prison in December 2010 when his family, a prominent Jewish family in Melbourne, asked for his body to be repatriated. Carr&apos;s office now admits that an Australian diplomat (who was not the ambassador) was aware that Zygier was being held. The case, however, remained encircled in a host of unanswered questions, as Zygier&apos;s family and friends in Australia remained tight-lipped about the circumstances of his death, refusing to discuss the case with the media.", "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T17:32:16Z", "title": "Australia was investigating 'Mossad agent' Zygier who died in Israeli jail", "sentences": ["In a further development deeply embarrassing for the Canberra government the Australia foreign minister, Bob Carr, was forced to revise his claims that the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv knew nothing of the case until after Zygier died in prison in December 2010 when his family, a prominent Jewish family in Melbourne, asked for his body to be repatriated."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/13/australia-mossad-zygier-israeli-jail"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "The Mossad", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news"], "article": "In the midst of an escalating international row with Australia, the Israeli government has been forced to admit that it secretly imprisoned a &quot;dual-nationality&quot; citizen \u2013 known as &quot;Prisoner X&quot; \u2013 who subsequently killed himself while being detained in Ayalon prison.     Ben Zygier. Photograph: ABC TV    Prisoner X has widely been reported as being 34-year-old Ben Zygier, who had both Australian and Israeli citizenship and has been described as an agent of Israel&apos;s external intelligence agency, the Mossad, who was arrested in Israel in 2010 on serious but unspecified charges. The information was released after a draconian gag order preventing reporting of the case in Israel was partially lifted by a court on Wednesday evening after media and political pressure. According to reports earlier in the week, Zygier had been held in circumstances of such secrecy and isolation that even his prison guards did not know his identity or alleged offence. The document released admitted that an inmate was registered under a false identity &quot;for security reasons&quot;, but added that his family in Australia \u2013 who have refused to comment on the case \u2013 were notified immediately upon his arrest. It added that the secret detention of Prisoner X was authorised by the most senior officials in Israel&apos;s justice ministry; and that the prisoner \u2013 referred to as &quot;John Doe&quot; \u2013 had been represented by three Israeli lawyers. The document did not make clear either the charge he faced or whether the lawyers were appointed by the state in secret. Israel&apos;s belated admission of the existence of Prisoner X follows a two-year effort to gag any media reporting about the controversial case which saw the office of Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, threaten editors with fines or jail if they disclosed details about the case earlier this week. That effort backfired as Israel faced a deluge of embarrassing revelations about the case which appeared to expose the detailed workings of its overseas intelligence agency in the most graphic detail, as well as the growing irritation of Israel&apos;s allies over the Mossad&apos;s behaviour. The disclosure came at the end of a day of extraordinary new details about the alleged double life of Zygier. It emerged that Zygier had been confronted shortly before his arrest by Australian journalist Jason Koutsoukis of Fairfax newspapers, who accused him of being a spy. Koutsoukis told the Guardian Zygier had been identified to him as one of three Australian-Israeli citizens working for the Mossad under the cover of a European front company that sold electronic equipment to Iran. He also said Zygier was under investigation by the Australian intelligence services and was close to being arrested for using his Australian passport for espionage. As the scandal over Zygier&apos;s treatment and suicide in Israel&apos;s Ayalon prison continued to grow, the Australian government was forced to admit that Israeli officials had briefed Australian diplomats over the case. Previously it had been claimed they knew nothing of Zygier&apos;s detention and death until his family asked for help to repatriate his body. In an embarrassing about-face on Thursday, Australia&apos;s foreign minister, Bob Carr, said his country had been made aware of Zygier&apos;s detention in February 2010. He said Australia had been given assurances by Israeli intelligence sources about Zygier&apos;s safety.  &quot;The Israeli government further advised the Australian government the individual would be treated in accordance with his lawful rights as an Israeli citizen,&quot; Carr said.\u00a0&quot;The Australian government relied on these assurances. At no stage during his detention did the Australian government receive any request from the individual or his family to extended consular support.\u00a0&quot;The Australian government was advised through intelligence on 16 December 2010 of this individual&apos;s death on the previous day and the deceased family had been notified by Israeli authorities.&quot;\u00a0According to the secretary of Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs, Peter Varghese, who is carrying out a review of how the Zygier case was handled, the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv had not been involved in the Zygier case but instead communications were carried out through intelligence channels. \u00a0&quot;The decision to continue communications through intelligence channels rather than to deal with this as a more normal consular case, can only I assume reflect a judgment that, given the nature of this case and that the charges pertained to national security issues, the more effective means of continuing to communicate would be through intelligence channels,&quot; Varghese told a Senate committee. Carr said a review would be conducted of his department&apos;s handling of the prisoner, who was found hanged in an Israeli prison cell in 2010. In Israel, meanwhile, the media was on Wednesday able to report parts of the story for the first time after the government partially lifted its ban on reporting any details of Zygier&apos;s imprisonment, imposed by an Israeli court after his arrest.

A man identified as General Hassan Shateri was reportedly assassinated by what Iranian officials described as &quot;the agents and supporters of the Zionist regime&quot; while travelling from Damascus to Beirut. It was not immediately clear in which of the two countries Shateri was killed but a Syrian rebel commander said an Iranian official was killed in an attack carried out by Syrian rebels in Zabadani in southwestern Syria, close to the Lebanese border. &quot;General Hassan Shateri was martyred by the agents and supporters of the Zionist regime on his way to Beirut from Damascus,&quot; the semi-official Mehr news agency quoted the Revolutionary Guards&apos; spokesman, Ramezan Sharif, as saying on Thursday. Iran&apos;s state English-language television, Press TV, reported that Shateri was killed on Tuesday and described him as the man who &quot;led the Iranian-financed reconstruction projects in the south of Lebanon&quot;. By pointing the finger at &quot;Israeli agents&quot;, Sharif was probably referring to Syrian rebels whom Iranian officials portray as terrorist armed groups backed by Tel Aviv. Iran is a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, providing both with military and financial support. Syria gives Iran physical access to Lebanon and Hezbollah, which is strategically important for Tehran&apos;s leaders because of the group&apos;s geographical position in respect to Israel. Iran does not recognise Israel as a country and usually refers to it as &quot;the Zionist regime&quot;. After the 2006 war between the Israeli military and Hezbollah, Iran&apos;s elite forces bolstered their presence in southern Lebanon, saying they were willing to revamp the region&apos;s war-stricken infrastructure. This became a contentious issue for Tel Aviv but boosted the popularity of Iran among Hezbollah supporters. Mehr said Shateri was a veteran of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war who in recent years &quot;had devoted his time to the reconstruction of damaged areas after the 33-day Israeli war on Lebanon&quot;. Iran&apos;s embassy in Lebanon, meanwhile, identified the dead man as Hessam Khoshnevis, leading to confusion that there might be a second death. But the circumstances given about Khoshnevis&apos;s death and his job title were similar to those of Shateri. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP that Shateri was killed when a rebel group ambushed his vehicle while he was returning to Lebanon from Syria. On Thursday Iran held a funeral ceremony for Shateri in Tehran that was attended by the foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, and the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Ali Jafari. Ghasem Suleimani, the man who heads the external arm of the Revolutionary Guards, known as the Quds force, members of which usually shun public ceremonies, also attended the funeral. In May 2012, a senior Quds force commander conceded for the first time that Iranian forces were operating in Syria in support of the Assad regime. &quot;If the Islamic republic was not present in Syria, the massacre of people would have happened on a much larger scale,&quot; Ismail Gha&apos;ani, the deputy head of the Quds force, said at the time. In February 2012, Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, went public to say that the Icountry has provided assistance to Hezbollah and Palestinian group Hamas. &quot;We have intervened in anti-Israel matters, and it brought victory in the 33-day war by Hezbollah against Israel in 2006, and in the 22-day war [in Gaza Strip]&quot; he said at the time.", "publicationDate": "2013-02-14T18:12:54Z", "title": "Elite Iranian general assassinated near Syria-Lebanon border", "sentences": ["By pointing the finger at &quot;Israeli agents&quot;, Sharif was probably referring to Syrian rebels whom Iranian officials portray as terrorist armed groups backed by Tel Aviv.", "This became a contentious issue for Tel Aviv but boosted the popularity of Iran among Hezbollah supporters."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/14/elite-iranian-general-assassinated-syria-lebanon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "The Mossad", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The Israeli government has reportedly offered to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the family of &quot;Prisoner X&quot; \u2013 an agent of the Mossad with Australian and Israeli citizenship who took his own life while secretly imprisoned for undisclosed &quot;grave charges&quot;. An unnamed source was quoted in the Haaretz newspaper claiming a compensation deal was agreed six weeks ago following the conclusion of an official inquiry into the death of Ben Zygier, who was imprisoned in 2010 under a false identity and who killed himself in Unit 15, a &quot;secret prison&quot; within Ayalon jail near Tel Aviv. Reports of a secret deal with the family follow claims by Zygier&apos;s lawyer that he had protested his innocence on the day before his death in a cell that was supposed to have been monitored 24 hours a day. Its also comes amid mounting calls for the Mossad and the Israeli prison service to face investigation over their alleged negligence in the scandal. A justice ministry official said the judge who had originally handled the case has demanded a further inquiry &quot;to examine issues of negligence&quot;. &quot;If she [the judge] had not found anything suspicious, she would not have transferred the case,&quot; said the official, adding that charges would be filed if the investigation finds there was any negligence in monitoring Zygier during his detention. Neither Zygier&apos;s Israeli wife nor his Australian parents have spoken publicly about his detention or his death. His wife is believed to have fled her home in Israel owing to the unrelenting media interest in her late husband. The Prisoner X case, which was thrust into the international spotlight after an Australian documentary named Zygier earlier this week has prompted a furious debate in Israel over both its military censorship regime, which had tried to silence reporting about the case with draconian gagging orders, and the ability of Israel to &quot;disappear&quot; some prisoners. As Israeli officials moved to say that Zygier was treated fairly, media in the country revealed that the case was not been unique and others suspected of security offences have been subjected to similar treatment. Several papers on Friday carried details of other &apos;Prisoner Xs&apos;, including Mordechai Kedar, a military intelligence officer who murdered a collaborator, KGB spies Marcus Klingberg and Shabtai Kalmanovich and Nahum Manbar. According to one unnamed source familiar with the Zygier case who spoke the YNet website: &quot;When an Israeli is detained for security offences, a process begins, but no one knows how it will end. He disappears into interrogation rooms, and no one knows where he is. They do it using two tools: A gag order and an injunction that prevents the detainee from meeting with an attorney. &quot;In this manner, the detainee is interrogated without being aware of his rights and without meeting anyone. The entire system is recruited to make him disappear.&quot; Although it has not be revealed what crime Zygier was charged with, details about his life and the case have emerged in recent days, including a claim that he had been one of several Israelis with Australian passports who had worked for business exporting telecommunication equipment from Italy to Iran that was a cover for an espionage operation. It has also been alleged that the Australian intelligence service Asio \u2013 which was already investigating the misuse of several Australian passports Zygier had acquired \u2013 believed he was about to disclose information about operations by the Mossad. Zygier is known to have operated under several monikers, including Ben Alon. It was under this name that he visited Iran, Syria and Lebanon. The Age newspaper has also listed Benjamin Burrows as a name Zygier adopted while studying for an MBA at Monash University in Melbourne. The latest claims came as Avigdor Feldman, a prominent human rights lawyer in Israel who visited Zygier in the days before his death to offer advice on the plea bargain he was negotiating, voiced his doubts over the official verdict of suicide. Feldman told ABC: &quot;I was impressed by a person thinking of his future and the decision he was about to make. I met someone who was definitely apprehensive, but with the rational apprehension of a person in his situation.

Hatnuah party leader Livni will serve as justice minister in Netanyahu&apos;s coalition with a special mandate to push forward in negotiations towards a peace settlement, which, if successful, would see Israel withdraw from Palestinian territory in the West Bank after decades of occupation. The veteran politicians form an unlikely alliance. In contrast to Netanyahu&apos;s scepticism, Livni has dedicated her political life to the peace process, often at significant personal cost. In 2009, she turned down the opportunity of forming a coalition government with Netanyahu despite an offer to share the role of prime minister because she did not feel he offered enough commitment to the peace process. Having retired from politics, Livni returned to the political arena in the last elections with a ticket focused almost solely on the peace process. &quot;I came to fight for peace \u2026 and I won&apos;t allow anyone to turn peace into a bad word,&quot; she vowed last November in a comeback speech that was fiercely critical of Netanyahu. Her narrow campaign focus cost her at the ballot box, with an Israeli electorate more concerned with domestic than foreign issues \u2013 as the success of Yair Lapid proved. Hatnuah won only six Knesset seats in January. Speaking on Army Radio on Sunday, Livni&apos;s Hatnuah party colleague Amir Peretz, who is tipped to serve as environmental protection minister, said an agreement could be made only if Netanyahu &quot;promised that negotiations for a political settlement with the Palestinians would occur&quot;. &quot;The parties that form the government are not important but rather its guiding principles,&quot; Peretz added. In her new position, Livni will be a member of the security cabinet and will lead a small team of personally appointed special staff into talks on condition that Netanyahu&apos;s man Yitzhak Molcho will have a place on her team. The prime minister will, however, retain the final word in any potential deal, which must also be approved by the Knesset and the cabinet. &quot;This development should lead to optimism. No [Israeli politician] is more identified, or has such a burning desire and severity of belief in the possibility of a peace agreement with the Palestinians, than Tzipi Livni. She is &apos;Mrs Peace Process&apos;,&quot; said Yehuda Ben Meir, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. &quot;Livni may have felt she had no option to agree to join the coalition after her poor showing at the election. Netanyahu may not keep his word. But knowing her record and her principles, I imagine she has reached some understanding that will seriously advance the peace process. Shared political goals make strange bedfellows,&quot; Ben Meir added. A former foreign minister, Livni has a reputation for being strong-willed and difficult to work with in Israel. One Israeli diplomat explained bluntly: &quot;She is pretty widely unpopular here, even if she is liked abroad.&quot; Political commentators received Tuesday&apos;s announcement with optimism but most nurse doubts that any newfound understanding between Livni and the prime minister will hold.", "publicationDate": "2013-02-19T18:33:31Z", "title": "Tzipi Livni appointed Israeli justice minister", "sentences": ["She is &apos;Mrs Peace Process&apos;,&quot; said Yehuda Ben Meir, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/19/tzipi-livni-israel-justice-minister"}, {"tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Media and tech events", "Changing Media Summit"], "article": "Ahead of the Changing Media Summit 2013, Saul Klein, a partner at Index Ventures, spoke to us about digital disruption, startups and why the internet has an impact on every single area of our lives. Can you tell us a little about Index Ventures? Index Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm. We invest around the world, at all stages from seed to early to growth and across sectors from media, retail, financial services to life science. Which media/tech areas do you think are ripe for disruption in 2013? We focus our investments on the internet and software. What we&apos;ve seen is that both the internet and software have disrupted sector after sector. From the mid-90s, entertainment and media have been feeling the effects. Retail is probably the second major sector to have experienced significant levels of disruption over the past 10 years, with e-commerce, particularly in the UK, accounting for a huge amount of how people go about buying and selling things. Increasingly, other sectors, financial services, education \u2013 are being disrupted as well. I would say that there are five or six sectors \u2013 media, retail, financial services, telecoms, education and software \u2013 that are all actively being affected by a combination of the internet and cloud computing. Our long-term belief is that there is no sector of the economy that will not end up being changed by a combination of the internet and software. If you look at the UK, 8% of GDP is accounted for by the internet, the highest level in the G20. Arguably, the internet is disrupting the economy rather than any sector of the economy. What advice would you give to startups and entrepreneurs? I think it depends at what stage. At the earlier stages we would always say to people to pick a market that is very large and significant. Focus on building a product or a service that people really want and ideally would be prepared to pay for, even if you choose to give it away for free. So building a really valuable product or service that customers like that they become reliant on is critical. And obviously to try and do that in a market that is large enough that were you to succeed you could build a business both significant and meaningful in scale. We tell people not to worry about incumbents. Not to worry too much about your competition. Just focus on making something great in a big market and making sure you build the best team you can possibly build. How do you think the digital startup scene differs here compared to Israel and to the US? I think the key hubs are becoming more and more similar. If you are in involved in the tech ecosystem in London you will feel pretty at home in New York, Tel Aviv, San Francisco or Berlin or Stockholm. I think there is a level of convergence between these different ecosystems where founders and people within them know each other pretty well and you can go from one to another fairly easily. What&apos;s different is the world outside of your bubble. So in San Francisco and the Bay area generally big companies, the media, friends, family really understand the language and modus operandi of the startup community and you feel very much supported there. The same is true of Israel, where startups part of the culture to the extent that it has been called the startup nation. In cities where there are long-established alternative ecosystems, such as London and New York, it&apos;s much harder to be fully integrated into the wider network of that city. But I think that&apos;s starting to change where big companies and the media and the government become very aware of how fundamental the internet is to the economy. In the UK it&apos;s the third largest sector in our economy. Finally \u2014 what will be your message to the industry at the Changing Media Summit 2013? People are very aware how fundamental the internet and software&apos;s impact has been on media to date. But what&apos;s interesting to me now is not just how fundamental an impact the internet and software is having on media or on retail, but on the economy and society as a whole. When the internet is 8% of GDP, it&apos;s fundamental. Today it&apos;s starting to seep into education, soon it&apos;ll be in healthcare, transportation, food and energy. Media and retail are just the beginning. Saul Klein is a partner at Index Ventures To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, sign up for free membership of the Guardian Media Network.

The results of an autopsy conducted in Tel Aviv were revealed at a press conference in Ramallah on Sunday evening after a day of angry protests across the West Bank and Gaza in which dozens were injured. The findings contradict the Israeli prison service&apos;s claim that Arafat Jaradat died on Saturday from a cardiac arrest. A Palestinian doctor&apos;s investigations found that while Jaradat&apos;s arteries were clear, the state of his body suggested he had been beaten in the days before his death. That contrasts with an Israeli health ministry statement that said that the autopsy found &quot;no signs of external trauma \u2026 apart from those pertaining to resuscitation [attempts] and a small graze on the right side of his chest&quot;. It said: &quot;No evidence of disease was found during the autopsy. Two internal hemorrhages were detected, one on the shoulder and one on the right side of the chest. Two ribs were broken, which may indicate resuscitation attempts. The initial findings cannot determine the cause of death. At this stage, until microscopic and toxicology reports are in, the cause of death cannot be tied to the autopsy findings.&quot; The 30-year-old, a petrol station worker and father of two, was arrested on 18 February in relation to a stone-throwing incident in November during which an Israeli was slightly injured. Aside from an old back injury inflicted by a teargas canister, his relatives insist he was healthy when he was arrested. A few days later, he died in Megiddo prison. Kameel Sabbagh, a lawyer who attended Jaradat&apos;s last hearing on Thursday, said he had advised the Israeli judge his client had been tortured and should be examined by the prison doctor. According to Sabbagh, this did not happen. &quot;He had serious pains in his back and other parts of his body because he was being beaten up and hanged for many long hours while he was being investigated,&quot; Sabbagh told Ma&apos;an news agency. His notes from the court hearing describe his client as &quot;extremely afraid&quot; of returning to his cell. A rumour that he had been beaten to death during an interrogation spread quickly on Sunday through Hebron, where hundreds of protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers for the second day running in the streets kilometres from Jaradat&apos;s home. &quot;When the soldiers came to arrest him last week, they told him say goodbye to your wife and your babies, you won&apos;t be seeing them again,&quot; said Mohamed Hashlamon, 58, as he watched masked Palestinian youths hurl concrete blocks from the roof above his home in downtown Hebron to arm themselves with the rubble. A phalanx of Israeli soldiers lining the border between the Israeli and Palestinian quarters answered rocks with rubber bullets and teargas. Three Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were injured in the clashes. &quot;People here are angry. They will fight until nightfall and they will protest again from 10am tomorrow just as they did yesterday,&quot; Hashlamon said. Jaradat&apos;s body was taken for the autopsy in Tel Aviv on Saturday and will be returned to his pregnant wife for burial in his village of Saeer after midday prayers on Monday. His death has inflamed already heightened tensions across the occupied Palestinian territory. On Friday, hundreds clashed with Israeli soldiers in a continuation of months-long demonstrations supporting four hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners held without charge in Israeli jails. On Saturday, nine Palestinians were injured, one critically, when settlers used live rounds of fire in clashes near Nablus. The Hebrew-language media have noted with alarm that the Palestinian Authority is doing little to dissuade protests but is lending its voice to the popular outrage. Issa Qaraqea, the PA&apos;s minister for prisoners&apos; affairs, expressed his suspicion of foul play in Jaradat&apos;s death. &quot;Our information was that Jaradat was being interrogated and then he died. Therefore we call for an international investigation into his death that may have resulted from torture,&quot; he told Reuters. As night fell on Sunday, the West Bank showed no sign of calming. In Beitunia, near Ramallah, two teenagers were reportedly hit with live rounds fired by Israeli soldiers. One, the 15 year-old son of the Palestinian secret services chief, was undergoing surgery having been shot in the stomach. &quot;Statements from the international community calling upon Israel to &apos;respect Palestinian prisoner rights&apos; are insufficient when Israel can arrest, incarcerate and even kill Palestinians without \u2026 consequences for its appalling actions,&quot; a statement from the Palestinian leadership read. &quot;Without justice, there will be no peace.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-02-24T17:59:43Z", "title": "Prisoner was tortured before dying in Israeli jail, says Palestinian Authority", "sentences": ["The results of an autopsy conducted in Tel Aviv were revealed at a press conference in Ramallah on Sunday evening after a day of angry protests across the West Bank and Gaza in which dozens were injured.", "Jaradat&apos;s body was taken for the autopsy in Tel Aviv on Saturday and will be returned to his pregnant wife for burial in his village of Saeer after midday prayers on Monday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/24/violence-west-bank-custody-death"}, {"tags": ["Nine Inch Nails", "Jane's Addiction", "Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Trent Reznor has announced the return of Nine Inch Nails.

Ben Zygier&apos;s death in December 2010, apparently by suicide, has been shrouded in mystery. Last month, Israel was forced to admit that it had secretly imprisoned Zygier on serious but unspecified charges. Zygier, 34, a father of two, originally from Melbourne but who had lived in Israel for 10 years and was also known by the names Ben Allen and Ben Alon, was believed to have worked for Israel&apos;s external intelligence agency, the Mossad. He was arrested in February 2010. Carr, said: &quot;Open sourced material\u00a0\u2026 would suggest he [Zygier] worked for the intelligence arm of the Israeli government. I cannot confirm or deny those reports, but you can draw your own conclusions.&quot; His comments came as he released his department&apos;s review into Australia&apos;s handling of the Zygier case. He said the review raised &quot;unanswered questions about the use of Australian passports of a dual national and they are not easily resolved&quot;. &quot;If it transpires that Australian passports were used for security or intelligence gathering by Israel in this case; it is something against which we take the strongest opposition,&quot; Carr said. &quot;No country can allow the integrity of its passport system to be compromised.&quot; He was unable to confirm speculation that Zygier&apos;s passports had been used in the 2010 murder of Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an operation in which a team of killers, believed to be Mossad agents, used stolen Australian and British identities. Carr said: &quot;We know that in 2010 there was an episode of this in Dubai. We can&apos;t say it took place in this case with Mr Zygier&apos;s several passports. I hope that one of the inquiries taking place in Israel can clarify this position.&quot; &quot;If that&apos;s confirmed we will be registering our strongest protest.&quot; The Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports prompted furious reactions from Britain and Australian not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and an Israeli diplomat was expelled from Canberra a few months later. Carr confirmed that Israeli authorities had given assurances to Australia&apos;s intelligence service, Asio, at the time of Zygier&apos;s detention that he would be afforded his full rights in jail. Carr also confirmed that Zygier had more than 50 visits from his family and lawyer during the 10 months he was held. &quot;At no time did his family or his lawyer come to the Australian government and say they needed assistance,&quot; he said.

And while Philip Himberg&apos;s play, based on a prize-winning documentary film, leaves a lot out, it has a generosity of spirit that proves raucously beguiling. It is not exactly clear why these feminised Filipino guys are drawn to Tel Aviv, or how they come to be qualified carers. What Himberg does suggest is that there is a natural overlap between their professional and private selves. Accordingly, he follows the fortunes of Salvador (or &quot;Sally&quot;) who for seven years has lovingly tended an ailing senior citizen and adopts the role of surrogate daughter. Given Sally&apos;s familial kindness, it&apos;s no surprise that he\u00a0becomes the conscience of the Paper Dolls so that, when their act is booked at a swinging niterie, he steadfastly refuses to flirt with the customers. Himberg&apos;s script tells only half the story. Aside from a few passing references to old boyfriends, the Filipino five seem to lead an oddly chaste existence and we hear little of the security problems posed by daily life in Tel Aviv. But what I like about the show is that it makes no pretence that the Paper Dolls is a world-class cabaret act,\u00a0and that the group&apos;s members feel no need either to apologise for\u00a0or explain their predilection: they are simply five guys who express themselves through dressing up and singing standards such as This Is My Life and Walk on the Wild Side. Even if Richard Kent&apos;s design oddly evokes the concrete brutalism of the National Theatre, Indhu Rubasingham&apos;s production has an infectious gaiety and there are exuberant performances from Francis Jue as the\u00a0tender-hearted Sally and Ron Domingo and Jon Norman Schneider as a pair of fractious brothers. All three are American actors but there is good, home-grown support from Tom Berish as a film\u2011making camp-follower and Caroline Wildi as an Israeli expat. It may not be high art but when the Paper Dolls gleefully inform us that Girls Just Want To Have Fun you gladly surrender to the\u00a0masquerade. \u2022 What have you been to see lately?

Here, they team up as the eponymous characters who inspired two writers&apos; most famous creations \u2013 Alice In Wonderland and Peter Pan \u2013 and met at a bookshop exhibition in 1932.

You couldn&apos;t make it up, could you? Actually, American writer Philip Himberg didn&apos;t have to: his play, Paper Dolls, is based on a true story, first seen as a TV series and then a documentary. The clash of cultures that lies at the heart of the play came about because ailing Hassidic men cannot be touched by women, so these economic migrants do the job to support their families back home \u2013 and on their nights off put on a bit of lippy and a frock and head off to Israeli gay clubs. It&apos;s a tale that certainly lends itself to theatre, with themes of immigration, borders and limitations, a search for home and identity. This is artistic director Indhu Rubasingham&apos;s second production at the Tricycle following the award-winning Red Velvet. Tricycle Theatre, NW6, to 13 Apr MC Curiosity Shop, Exeter Dickens gets an update in the latest show from south-west company Theatre Alibi.

It&apos;s about to be repossessed, leaving Nell and her grandad homeless. Out on the road, they meet a cast of characters who include saints, sinners, wide-boy rappers, bent lawyers, conmen and good samaritans.

However, life in this country turns out to be tough, too, as Alem struggles to create a future and an identity.

Members of the university&apos;s faculty of arts and sciences began a vote of no confidence in John Sexton, who is accused of running NYU with an &quot;excessive use of executive power&quot; more akin to a large corporation than a respected university. A large number of faculty members are thought to oppose Sexton, but even if he loses the vote, which will be completed on Friday, any decision on his future rests with the board of trustees, which has so far given him strong backing. Board of trustees chair Martin Lipton said on Monday: &quot;The trustees strongly and unanimously support John. We are mindful of the concerns held by some faculty, but the trustees see a thriving, advancing university. &quot;We have confidence that John and faculty will continue to work together for the betterment of the university. Positive steps in this direction have already begun.&quot; Under Sexton&apos;s tenure, NYU, America&apos;s largest private university, has been transformed into a lucrative overseas brand with 10 international centres, including bases in Tel Aviv, Buenos Aires and Abu Dhabi. The expansion has won praise from Hillary Clinton, who in 2011 lauded Sexton&apos;s &quot;vision to expand his university internationally while maintaining its reputation for excellence and academic freedom&quot;. But in New York, many academics voiced doubt about the plans. &quot;Faculty had no say over whether we wanted to be a global university,&quot; said Andrew Ross, a sociologist and president of the NYU&apos;s chapter of the American Association of University Professors. He added that the move was solely a decision made by the president and was indicative of the way the university was being run. &quot;It is more akin to executive power used at a corporation. Universities are not supposed to be run like that. They are supposed to be run by shared governance,&quot; he told the Guardian. In particular, concerns have been raised at the locations of some of the overseas centres. Some faculty members have complained that NYU&apos;s reputation could be tarnished as a result of human rights abuses in the United Arab Emirates, whose government has donated tens of millions of dollars to NYU. In a statement on Monday, Sexton said: &quot;Whatever the outcome of this vote, I can say that I have confidence in the NYU faculty \u2013 they are an extraordinary scholarly community. &quot;In the university setting, we believe in criticism, because it makes us better. And when good colleagues have suggestions about how I can improve in serving the university, I listen carefully.&quot; Votes of no confidence in university heads are not unheard of. In November, faculty at the University of San Diego voted in favour of removing its university president. At Kean University in New Jersey, professors and other staff affirmed a lack of confidence in the university&apos;s board of trustees. &quot;It is becoming more common in American universities. It is a last resort of faculty, and a response to administration wielding of executive power,&quot; Ross said. Sexton&apos;s management style is not the only issue: a plan to expand its New York City campus, known as NYU 2031, has attracted significant opposition. Sexton defended the plan in an open letter to New Yorkers. He wrote: &quot;Having been extremely economical with space \u2013 NYU has approximately half the square footage per student of Columbia, one quarter of Harvard&apos;s \u2013 the university has reached a tipping point. &quot;Space is required to create a vibrant intellectual community in all senses of the phrase, with teachers and learners in proximity to each other, ready and willing to engage with other thinkers and doers throughout the city.&quot; Those behind the confidence vote, however, fear that the president&apos;s vision for a larger New York campus will run roughshod over the need to maintain culturally sensitive areas in the city. &quot;What is planned will transform downtown Manhattan,&quot; Ross said. &quot;That has caused concern not just from faculty, but among the community at large in Greenwich Village.&quot; It is unsure just how far the vote could go in unseating Sexton. Ross concedes that the board of trustees are &quot;big supporters&quot; of the president, who has overseen a large injection of new money. Trustees have also awarded him large increases in his salary, which now stands at nearly $1.5m. But a high-profile &quot;no&quot; vote could go some way to forcing the hands of board members, especially if other schools at NYU initiate their own ballots. Ross suggested that among other faculties eying a confidence vote were the Tisch school of the arts, the Gallatin achool, and the Steinhardt school of culture, education and human Development. &quot;Faculty senators are certainly interested in following suit,&quot; he added. The faculty of arts and science vote closes Friday at 6pm, with the result expected soon after.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T18:23:47Z", "title": "NYU faculty members begin no-confidence vote against president John Sexton", "sentences": ["Positive steps in this direction have already begun.&quot; Under Sexton&apos;s tenure, NYU, America&apos;s largest private university, has been transformed into a lucrative overseas brand with 10 international centres, including bases in Tel Aviv, Buenos Aires and Abu Dhabi."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/11/nyu-no-confidence-vote-john-sexton"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Iran", "Hezbollah", "Israel", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Iran and Hezbollah have built a 50,000-strong parallel force in Syria to help prolong the life of the Assad regime and to maintain their influence after his fall, Israel&apos;s military intelligence chief has claimed. Major General Aviv Kochavi said Iran intended to double the size of this Syrian &quot;people&apos;s army&quot;, which he claimed was being trained by Hezbollah fighters and funded by Tehran, to bolster a depleted and demoralised Syrian army. Kochavi, the director of military intelligence in the Israel defence forces (IDF), also said Assad&apos;s troops had readied chemical weapons but so far had not been given the order for them to be used. At the same time, he warned of the increasing sway of extremist groups in the opposition, particularly the al-Nusra Front, which he claimed was beginning to infiltrate Lebanon and was making connections with a Sinai-based militant organisation, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, which is focused on attacks on Israel. Israel opposes the western arming of Syrian rebels because of its fears that the weapons will end up in the hands of such groups. Defence officials say they are focused on Assad&apos;s sizeable arsenal of chemical weapons and missiles and they are prepared to carry out more air strikes to stop such arms being transferred to Hezbollah, even at the risk of what a senior official predicted would be an ugly new war in Lebanon. Western and Israeli governments have long alleged that members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are advising Assad&apos;s generals, and that Hezbollah guerillas are fighting alongside Syrian government troops. Israeli officials say the commander of the Revolutionary Guards&apos; elite Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, has been in Damascus to oversee operations. In his speech on Thursday, Kochavi went much further and claimed that since last June Tehran had been using Hezbollah to build up a large Syrian militia that would be Iranian-controlled even in the event of Assad&apos;s fall from power. &quot;The damages of the imminent fall of Syria are very high for both Iran and Hezbollah. Iran is losing a sole ally in the region surrounding Israel. It will lose the ability to transfer weaponry through Syria to Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah are both doing all in their power to assist Assad&apos;s regime. &quot;They support Assad operationally on the ground, with strategic consultation, intelligence, weapons,&quot; Kochavi told the Herzliya Conference, a meeting of security officials and analysts in Israel. &quot;Most recently, they are establishing a &apos;people&apos;s army&apos; trained by Hezbollah and financed by Iran, currently consisting of 50,000 men, with plans to increase to 100,000. Iran and Hezbollah are also preparing for the day after Assad&apos;s fall, when they will use this army to protect their assets and interests in Syria.&quot; He said the Syrian regular army was crumbling, claiming that several successive recruitment drives had failed, realising only 20% of their targets as young men had fled rather than join up. The International Institute of Strategic Studies yesterday reported that from a notional strength of 220,000, the army had withered to a core of about 50,000 the regime could rely on. The Institute for the Study of War in Washington estimated the loyal core at 65,000. Israel has warned the UK and France against arming Syrian rebels, arguing there will be no guarantees that sophisticated weapons such as portable anti-aircraft missiles will not ultimately find their way to al-Qaida affiliates and other extremist groups, and be turned against Israel. Kochavi claimed the al-Nusra Front had sent &quot;subsidiaries&quot; into Lebanon and had forged connections with Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (also known as Ansar Jerusalem), which has launched attacks into Israel from the Sinai. He said al-Nusra intended to help the group establish cells in Lebanon. Israel&apos;s immediate focus is on preventing any of Assad&apos;s stockpile of chemical weapons and anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles reaching Lebanon. Israeli officials say they have &quot;intimate co-operation&quot; with US intelligence on tracking these weapons. In February Israeli planes bombed a convoy suspected of transferring modern anti-aircraft missiles from Syria to Hezbollah, and Israeli officials, while not formally acknowledging them, would not hesitate to strike again. &quot;There is a readiness to strike again and an awareness that this could escalate. Israel is heavily focused on this, but worried that the rest of the world is not,&quot; an Israeli security source said. A senior IDF official said there were an estimated 50,000 rockets of various ranges in Hezbollah hands, of which a few thousand were capable of reaching Tel Aviv. He acknowledged that Israeli air strikes could trigger a war which neither Israel nor Hezbollah wanted at this time, in which Hezbollah would use much of this arsenal, forcing the IDF to launch another invasion of southern Lebanon, as he said only ground troops could root out the rockets and launchers that were hidden in south Lebanese villages. &quot;Hezbollah will give a house to a fighter in a village. It will be a three-storey house and one storey is for the storage of missiles,&quot; the IDF official said. &quot;In a future war, we would have to bomb and to send troops into the village. Unfortunately, it is not getting to be surgical. We will do everything we can to evacuate the area of civilians, but I think it&apos;s going to be ugly.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-14T14:35:29Z", "title": "Iran and Hezbollah 'have built 50,000-strong force to help Syrian regime'", "sentences": ["A senior IDF official said there were an estimated 50,000 rockets of various ranges in Hezbollah hands, of which a few thousand were capable of reaching Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/14/iran-hezbollah-force-syrian-regime"}, {"tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "Barack Obama", "World news"], "article": "This should be a rare moment of hope. On Friday Israel got a new government and in a few days it will be treated to a US presidential visit, the first of Barack Obama&apos;s second term. You&apos;d think that, like jump leads applied to a car whose battery died years ago, this double jolt of electricity would inject some life into the long-stalled quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace. A new coalition in Israel, a new US secretary of state \u2013 one who, by all accounts, has got &quot;the peace bug&quot; \u2013 and a renewed American president: it should surely add up to what this enduring problem desperately needs, a fresh start.And yet, to recall Obama&apos;s one-time slogan, you&apos;ll find almost no one who expresses hope for any change. Expectations for this week&apos;s visit are rock bottom. Even those well-disposed towards Obama say he&apos;ll be coming to Israel as a tourist, seeing the key sights and shaking a few hands, with no initiative to launch, no plan to unveil. As one Palestinian salesman in Ramallah told the Global Post: &quot;I know he&apos;s coming, but he&apos;s coming for nothing.&quot; Expectations for the new government are scarcely brighter. It&apos;s not only that the prime minister remains the same Binyamin Netanyahu, a man whose belief in, and commitment to, what used to be called the peace process is slim to nonexistent. The makeup of his coalition, which took nearly two months to assemble, suggests paralysis is the best we can hope for. Some will have been heartened by the appointment of the relatively dovish Tzipi Livni to oversee negotiations with the Palestinians. But realists say she&apos;ll be no more than a public face, charged with making nice in foreign capitals, holding endless rounds of talks, enabling Netanyahu to say Israel is doing its bit, while achieving precisely nothing. That Livni and her tiny six-seat party are destined to be a figleaf is confirmed by the merest glance at the coalition arithmetic. Even if she were somehow to make a breakthrough, that would necessarily require Israeli concessions which would be instantly vetoed by the more powerful Jewish Home party headed by Naftali Bennett. Elected on a promise to annex 60% of the West Bank and having ruled out a Palestinian state for the next 200 years at least, Bennett will block any deal that the two sides could plausibly make. So yes, there are more amenable faces \u2013 chief among them the surprise star of the January election, the TV host and columnist Yair Lapid \u2013 but in practice there will be little change affecting the core conflict. The hawks still have the best seats at the top table, Bennett reinforcing both a Likud party whose newest intake has shifted sharply to the right, and the faction loyal to the scandal-plagued ultra-nationalist Avigdor Lieberman, who is himself a West Bank settler. Put simply, there is no meaningful move this coalition could make towards the Palestinians without falling apart. Bibi would prefer to concentrate, as he has for 20 years, on the threat of a nuclear Iranhttp://www.salon.com/2012/09/17/bibis_20_year_iran_warnings/. Doubtless he&apos;ll keep bringing Obama back to that topic next week. But otherwise he newly weakened PM, now answerable to Bennett and Lapid, will instead be compelled to focus inward. Lapid was elected on a domestic platform, promising action on the economy and &quot;sharing the burden&quot;, code for ensuring that ultra-orthodox Jews \u2013 their parties absent from the ruling coalition for thte first time in years \u2013 lose their current exemption from military conscription. After the social protests on the streets of Tel Aviv in the summer of 2011, Israeli politicians have received clear instructions from the electorate: take care of the home front. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are beset by their own, more familiar troubles: the weakness of Mahmoud Abbas and the enduring division of Hamas and Fatah, which makes Gaza ever more distant from the West Bank. The result is that this conflict is as stuck as ever. That notion can sound comforting: if the status quo holds, then at least things aren&apos;t getting worse. But it&apos;s a delusion. There is nothing static about this status quo. As Hagai El-Ad of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel puts it, when things seem to be standing still they are always changing, most obviously through the creation of &quot;facts on the ground&quot;, the expanding Israeli settlements on the West Bank. The more of those there are, the harder it will be to turn that land into a future Palestinian state. It&apos;s too late to change Obama&apos;s itinerary, but perhaps not too late to influence the in-flight entertainment on Air Force One. It&apos;s a long journey, so the president should have time to see two films, both Oscar nominees. The first is not Les Miz or Argo, but 5 Broken Cameras. Shot by an amateur Palestinian film-maker in the West Bank village of Bil&apos;in, it is a powerful eyewitness account of the everyday reality of the occupation, from unarmed villagers clashing with Israeli soldiers to Bil&apos;in&apos;s cherished olive trees set aflame by nearby settlers. That will show the president what this stuck situation is doing to the occupied. But then he should watch The Gatekeepers, released in the UK next month, to see what it is doing to the occupier. This remarkable film consists chiefly of interviews with six former heads of Israel&apos;s security agency, the Shin Bet. The men speak with astonishing candour of past operations, explaining in brutal detail how they took on the terrorist enemy, whether in an interrogation cell or by a bomb dropped from the sky. They are hard men, one smiling with pride as he recalls the ingenious elimination of Hamas&apos;s top bomb-maker via a cellphone packed with explosives. &quot;It was clean,&quot; he says, &quot;elegant.&quot; These are not men to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. Yet asked to assess the bigger picture, each one is crystal clear. &quot;You cannot make peace using military means,&quot; says Avi Dichter. &quot;For Israel, it&apos;s too much of a luxury not to speak with our enemies,&quot; says Carmi Gillon. &quot;There is no alternative to talking,&quot; says Avraham Shalom. Each one of these warriors concedes that their work is ultimately futile, that Israeli security will only be achieved by a negotiated accommodation with the Palestinians. These men, who guarded the very gates of Israel, have come to understand that force only buys you time \u2013 and that time is running out. Weary, they declare that 46 years of occupation has corroded the soul of the nation they have devoted their lives to protect. &quot;We&apos;ve become cruel,&quot; says Shalom, perhaps the hardest of these hard men. &quot;To ourselves, but mainly to the occupied population.&quot; As his plane heads towards Ben-Gurion airport, Obama should reflect on that. If he actually means the words he&apos;ll spend several days repeating \u2013 about the great friendship between the US and Israel \u2013 if he truly cares about Israel, he cannot come as a mere tourist. He must come with a message. He should listen to those who understand this occupation best, because they understand that it has to end.

In fact every week of the year, somewhere on the planet, a fashion week takes place beneath the radar: this month alone, Beirut, Bangkok and Reykjavik will welcome models, buyers and the fashion press to their catwalks. As recently as two years ago, many of these events didn&apos;t exist. Now you can see bare shoulders on catwalks in Islamabad and shows that address religious and social divides in Tel Aviv; even hard-up Haiti delighted onlookers by hosting its first fashion week in November. It&apos;s not just a measure of economic progress in the developing world \u2013 it&apos;s proof that, as fashion goes global, countries that were seen as the cheap labour to which the west outsourced its dirty work are claiming back their industry. These fledgling events are fast evolving. At the first-ever fashion week in Cambodia, I was roped into modelling when resources were scarce: now Vogue and FashionTV are bumping shoulderpads in the front rows. That these showcases of local talent are starting to turn heads \u2013 influential fashion bloggers and international press now pay close attention to the designs \u2013 is hardly surprising. The industry prides itself on sniffing out the next big thing. Who can deny the allure of the original and conceptual creations seen on catwalks across Africa, like the Gaga-worthy confections by Gambian designer Dabo for Nigeria fashion week \u2013 design inspired from a pool of references different from those in the west.

He is at least trying outwardly to show that he is a friend of Bibi&apos;s. And it&apos;s important for us to have him on side. He will see the people of Israel up close. He will see Israel is more than the strong, powerful, developed country people think; it is small and endangered. Everyone is talking about us giving up land and cities to the Palestinians and he will see now that this means evacuating people from their homes. &quot;I think his agenda is pro-Palestinian but he is trying to keep that in check. It was facetious of him to believe that there could so easily be peace in the Middle East. But I think he knows better now \u2013 we are not ready yet.

I don&apos;t think anything will happen, I don&apos;t believe our new government will do anything to move towards peace unless they are forced to. And if there is anyone who can do this, it is our friend, the president of the United States. &quot;I think he tried to work towards peace in his first term but Netanyahu is a difficult man to deal with. It&apos;s a problem. Who knows what will actually come of this trip, but there is more chance of progress with him here than without him. Of course, Clinton was more popular here.

But since then, he has proved himself to be the worst of all US presidents. &quot;He is the first in history to use a veto against us at the United Nations. &quot;If he comes to visit Al-Aqsa mosque he would go under the guidance, the security and the so-called sovereignty of Israel. He would be recognising their illegal annexation of Jerusalem. If he will do that, he will spark the third Intifada \u2013 there would be a waterfall of blood.

He only does things in order for people to like him. &quot;Israel doesn&apos;t have a real friend in Obama. &quot;I don&apos;t think his visit will do much good.

Their parents fled in the 1948 war, leaving their homes forever. But more than 60 years later, it took just one click of a mouse for them to claim their own hilltop outside the ancient village of Farkha, looking out over undulating terraces of olive and almond trees towards Tel Aviv. &quot;It felt unreal. We&apos;ve bought land elsewhere before but there&apos;s an emotional factor when it comes to Palestine \u2013 it was hard for me to accept that I owned land there,&quot; Ali recalled. &quot;It had also been pretty much impossible to buy land in Palestine and guarantee that you owned it until we met Khaled.&quot; Khaled Sabawi, the Canadian-born son of Palestinian refugees, launched Tabo three years ago. Appropriating the Ottoman term for &quot;title deed&quot;, the business was built upon a dream of his father&apos;s to help Palestinians buy Palestinian land. It is a dream that most of the estimated 5 million scattered Palestinian refugees would consider impossible. The conflict that Barack Obama flies into this week for the first time during his presidency is essentially an Israeli-Palestinian battle for land. It is a fight for ownership of the 10,000 sq miles (26,000 sq km) of historic Palestine claimed by both sides as a holy land and a homeland. In terms of &quot;facts on the ground&quot;, it is a battle that Israel is winning. In 1993, the international community witnessed Israeli and Palestinian leaders sign the Oslo agreement to divide the land into two states for two peoples. Yet, since 1996, more than 100 new Israeli outposts have been established in the future Palestinian state. The Palestinians have built one, Rawabi. Many Israeli Jews believe they have a God-given right to settle anywhere in the biblical land of Israel. Others justify the defiance of international law on the grounds of national security or argue that Arabs cannot be trusted. Many settlers have benefited from cheap mortgages and enjoy an enviable lifestyle. As Michael Sfard, a top Israeli lawyer advising the human rights group Yesh Din, puts it: &quot;During the second intifada, at negotiations in Taba and Camp David, Israelis said you can&apos;t negotiate peace in one room when there is shooting outside. &quot;By the same token, you can&apos;t negotiate peace in one room while an unofficial land grab is being waged outside. Even if [Israeli prime minister, Binyamin] Netanyahu signs a peace deal today, this won&apos;t stop Israel from expanding inside Palestine unofficially.&quot; Sabawi and other critics of the Palestinian Authority would add that Israel&apos;s ongoing success in the struggle for territory is aided by the Palestinian leadership&apos;s failure to protect Palestinian land. Legal proof of ownership is almost impossible to come by in the West Bank, where 70% of land is unregistered and ancestral property is inherited by dozens of heirs. Israeli settlements have thrived on this legal ambiguity. &quot;The best way to protect Palestinian land is to create title deeds and we have created hundreds of parcels of title deed land that are now owned by Palestinians. But it was a laborious, arduous, exhausting process throughout which the bureaucracy of the Palestinian Authority \u2013 not Israel \u2013 has been the greatest obstacle,&quot; Sabawi said. It took Tabo&apos;s team of lawyers and engineers four years to register 100 hectares (250 acres) of Palestinian land. In each case, the process started from scratch. It involved negotiating with multiple heirs claiming ownership of a plot of land, agreeing on the borders of that plot, getting an official map of the land approved by the council and then applying for a title deed to legalise ownership. The Tabo website invites prospective buyers in the West Bank, Jerusalem and the far-flung diaspora on a virtual tour of every plot of registered land with a 180-degree view from the site, its height from sea level and slope gradient. Plots are sold for $13,000 (\u00a38,600) to $80,000 and can be paid off over three years. The new high-rise development at Rawabi is Tabo&apos;s closest counterpart in the affordable Palestinian housing market. The urban project benefited from major international support, primarily from USAid and Qatar, and Israeli co-operation. Bashar al-Masry, the Palestinian businessman behind the private venture, was allowed exceptional privileges. The bureaucratic challenges Sabawi and other Palestinians face were pushed aside and title deeds for Rawabi land were granted in one bundle. Locals who owned land in three villages on the proposed site and refused to sell were forced to accept the market rate by the Palestinian Authority. A row about preferential treatment to well-connected individuals ensued. In Farkha, where 90 plots of land have been sold through Tabo, the council is cautiously supportive of the initiative. Tabo has paved roads and extended water and electricity networks to reach their plots of land. &quot;The newcomers will probably help our economy and it&apos;s better that the land is not in the hands of settlers. But Sabawi is not buying our land because he likes our blue eyes. He&apos;s got a good business going,&quot; said Hassan Abdullah Hajaj, a council leader for 16 years. Most villagers, he said, sold land to Tabo for $5,000 per 1,000 sq metres or less out of economic necessity. Unlike Hajaj or Sabawi, the Dabbaghs still cherish an optimistic ideal of Palestine. Ali is an eye surgeon specialising in diabetes and plans to open a clinic in Farkha. The couple have hired an architect to design their home, even though they have yet to receive permission from the Israeli authorities to live in the West Bank. When Ali last flew to Tel Aviv, he was refused entry, despite a British passport. &quot;At least 10 of our friends and relatives have bought land through Tabo after we told them about it. Some don&apos;t even plan to live there \u2013 they feel they are protecting the land just by owning it,&quot; Sana explained. Ali added: &quot;For me it was just something I took for granted. I knew I was going to end up in Palestine. If, God forbid, I don&apos;t get to, at least now I know my children can.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T16:44:32Z", "title": "Palestinians buy land to protect future state and generations", "sentences": ["But more than 60 years later, it took just one click of a mouse for them to claim their own hilltop outside the ancient village of Farkha, looking out over undulating terraces of olive and almond trees towards Tel Aviv.", "When Ali last flew to Tel Aviv, he was refused entry, despite a British passport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/palestinians-land-protect-future"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Obama administration", "World news"], "article": "Barack Obama landed at Tel Aviv airport on Wednesday for a three-day visit to Israel and Palestine that the White House \u2013 anxious to set low-to-zero expectations of tangible outcomes \u2013 has billed primarily as a listening exercise.  Talks between the US president and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, were expected to focus on Iran, Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The president will also travel to Ramallah to meet Palestinian leaders. Israeli air space was due to close for about an hour for the arrival of Air Force One. Obama was greeted by Netanyahu, who was sworn in this week as leader of the new Israeli government; President Shimon Peres; other senior politicians and dignitaries; a contingent of Israeli soldiers; and a military orchestra.  The US president&apos;s first task is to inspect an Iron Dome mobile missile defence unit \u2013 funded by the US \u2013 that has been brought to Ben Gurion airport. He will then fly to Jerusalem by helicopter, though most of his entourage of 600 will travel by road, requiring the closure of the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Obama and Netanyahu were due to hold five hours of talks. Despite the lack of personal warmth between the two leaders it will be the tenth time they have met face to face since both took office in early 2008. No other world leader has clocked up as many meetings with Obama. The Iranian nuclear programme is top of the agenda for Netanyahu, closely followed by the deteriorating security situation in neighbouring Syria. The stalled peace process with the Palestinians will also be discussed, along with Israel&apos;s regional relationships, principally with Turkey and Egypt. Some US and Israeli officials say the trip is also aimed at recalibrating the tetchy relationship between the two leaders at the start of their second terms and building trust on both sides. The White House has said it is a &quot;chance to connect with the Israeli people&quot;, who are largely distrustful of Obama. A poll published last week in the Israeli newspaper Ma&apos;ariv found that only 10% of Israelis had a favourable attitude towards Obama, with 17% defining their attitude towards the US president as &quot;hateful&quot;. As part of his overture, Obama will to deliver his keynote speech of the visit to an invited audience of Israeli university students at the International Convention Centre in Jerusalem on Thursday. He will travel to Ramallah to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the prime minister, Salaam Fayyad. The seven-mile journey will be made by heliicopter, thus avoiding crossing the 24ft-high concrete separation wall that snakes through Jerusalem, separating off parts of the east of the city and the West Bank. However, the president will have a bird&apos;s-eye view of the barrier and some of the 130-plus Jewish settlements that punctuate the West Bank landscape. Many Palestinians are hostile to Obama, believing he failed to live up to early pledges to halt Israeli colonisation of the West Bank and tried to obstruct their quest for recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations. On Tuesday, scuffles broke out between anti-Obama protesters and police near the Muqata, the presidential compound in Ramallah where Thursday&apos;s meeting is due to take place. Many posters bearing Obama&apos;s face have been torn or painted over. According to the Palestinian Authority, 3,000 police officers will be on duty in the city alongside US security personnel. Five thousand Israeli police will be stationed in Jerusalem for each day of Obama&apos;s visit. Both Israelis and Palestinians are sceptical about the chances of any real movement on the decades-old conflict. A poll published in the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday suggested eight out of 10 Israelis do not believe that Obama will succeed in brokering a peace deal in the next four years. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian legislator, on Tuesday criticised the visit&apos;s stated goal of listening to both sides. &quot;The issue is not about listening but realising the reality of the situation and dealing with it,&quot; he told reporters in Ramallah. &quot;The passivity of the United States is dangerous at a time when the whole notion of the two-state solution is at risk.

The presidential entourage leaves Israel for Jordan on Friday afternoon but Kerry will head back on Saturday for further talks over dinner with Netanyahu. He had not been expected to return to the region until next month. In January, Kerry warned US senators that the chances of achieving a Palestinian state alongside Israel were diminishing.

Despite the &quot;great success&quot; of Obama in mobilising the international community behind stringent sanctions against Iran, Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, insisted such an approach must be &quot;augmented by the clear and credible threat of military action&quot;. And although he accepted that Obama was determined to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu said: &quot;Israel can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends. And Israel has no better friend than the United States of America.&quot; Netanyahu said Obama&apos;s recent statement that it would take the Iranian regime about a year to manufacture a nuclear weapon was correct: &quot;We have a common assessment.&quot; But, Netanyahu added, Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment programme could reach a &quot;zone of immunity&quot; earlier. The two leaders strove to demonstrate a new warmth in their relationship, with Obama repeatedly referring to the Israeli prime minister by his nickname &quot;Bibi&quot;. As Obama quoted a letter written by Netanyahu&apos;s brother, Yoni, who died in an operation to free Israeli hostages in Entebbe in 1976, the prime minister was visibly emotional. The pair also joked about their children, wives and gene pools. Netanyahu obliquely acknowledged concerns about some rightwing elements of his new government sworn in earlier this week, but insisted that Israel remained &quot;fully committed to peace [with the Palestinians] and to the solution of two states for two peoples. We extend our hand in peace and in friendship to the Palestinian people.&quot; Obama appeared reluctant to dwell on the issue, twice saying he would return to it in his keynote speech on Thursday. He suggested both sides must take steps &quot;to build trust and confidence upon which lasting peace can depend&quot;, but did not mention the critical issue of Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which has derailed peace talks for the past two and a half years. Obama said that as part of America&apos;s &quot;long-term commitment to Israel&apos;s security, the prime minister and I agreed to begin discussions on extending military assistance to Israel.&quot; The current agreement lasted until 2017, but officials would begin work on extending it &quot;to the years beyond&quot;. In response to a question, Obama said the main goal of his visit was to let the Israeli people know they had a friend in the United States. That was evident in his remarks on landing in Israel earlier in the day, when he spoke of the eternal and unbreakable alliance between the two countries and of &quot;America&apos;s unwavering commitment to Israel&apos;s security&quot;.

Security was tight in the city, with roads around the King David hotel \u2013 the base for the 600-strong entourage \u2013 closed and at least 5,000 Israeli police officers on duty round the clock. US security service personnel were liaising with their counterparts in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. The first day of Obama&apos;s visit was dominated by five hours of talks between the president and Netanyahu. Despite the lack of personal warmth between the two leaders, it was the 10th time the pair have met face-to-face since both took office in early 2008. No other world leader has clocked up as many meetings with Obama. Some US and Israeli officials said the trip was partly aimed at recalibrating the tetchy relationship between the two leaders at the start of their second terms, and building trust on both sides. The White House has said it was also a &quot;chance to connect with the Israeli people&quot;. A poll published last week in the Israeli newspaper Ma&apos;ariv found that only 10% of Israelis had a favourable attitude towards Obama. Seventeen percent defined their attitude towards the US president as &quot;hateful&quot;. As part of his overture, Obama will deliver his keynote speech of the visit to an invited audience of Israeli university students at the International Convention Centre in Jerusalem on Thursday. He will also travel to Ramallah to meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and prime minister Salaam Fayyad. The seven-mile journey will be made by heliciopter, thus avoiding crossing the 24ft high concrete separation wall which snakes through Jerusalem, dividing it from much of the east of the city and the West Bank. However, the president will have a birds-eye view of the barrier and some of the 130-plus Jewish settlements that punctuate the West Bank landscape.  Obama&apos;s itinerary for his 50-hour visit includes visits to the Israel Museum to view the Dead Sea Scrolls, Israel&apos;s haunting Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, and the graves of Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, and assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. He will make a second trip \u2013 again by helicopter - to the Palestinian territories on Friday to visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-20T21:33:00Z", "title": "Netanyahu reaffirms US-Israel bond on Obama visit but talks tough on Iran", "sentences": ["In his welcoming remarks after Obama touched down at Tel Aviv airport, Israeli president Shimon Peres thanked America for its unshakeable support and said &quot;a world without your friendship would invite aggressions against Israel&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/20/obama-netanyahu-israel-us-bond-iran-threat"}, {"tags": ["War films", "Film", "Culture"], "article": " Tobruk (1967)Director: Arthur HillerEntertainment grade: C+History grade: C\u2013 Tobruk is a port on the east of Libya&apos;s Mediterranean coast, near the border with Egypt. It was a hard-fought prize during the second world war, occupied at different times by Allied and Axis forces. People           It&apos;s September 1942. A Canadian soldier named Major Craig (Rock Hudson) has been taken prisoner by the Italians, and is being shipped to occupied France. At Algiers, he is kidnapped and loaded onto a German plane. Believing he has been taken by the Nazis, Craig stolidly refuses an offer of inflight hot chocolate from the suave Captain Bergman (George Peppard, who \u2013 if you grew up in the 80s \u2013 is impossible not to see as Hannibal from the A-Team). In fact, Bergman says, he&apos;s from the &quot;Special Identification Group. German Jews serving with the British.&quot; The SIG \u2013 whose full name is disputed, with confusion among historians about whether the &quot;I&quot; stood for interrogation, identification or intelligence \u2013 was real. When so little is known about a group that even its name is unclear, it&apos;s not a bad idea for film-makers to fictionalise things wholesale rather than messing around with real people. And they have: the only real character here is Erwin Rommel, and he doesn&apos;t appear on screen. Military           Bergman and Craig arrive at a desert camp. In charge is a Brit, Colonel Harker (Nigel Green, who steals the show). At this point, Rommel had taken Tobruk and was threatening Egypt. Harker&apos;s madcap plan is to have the SIG disguise themselves as Nazis and drive across &quot;800 miles of the worst desert the Sahara has to offer, right into the back door of Tobruk&quot; with a group of supposed British prisoners who, on reaching Tobruk, will join them in attacking Rommel&apos;s supply lines. This might sound far-fetched, but it&apos;s more or less true, according to Jewish military historian Martin Sugarman. The real SIG, says Sugarman, had German weapons, chocolates and cigarettes \u2013 though the film makes a plot point out of getting that wrong. They even had &quot;love letters to fictitious wives in Germany, composed by an SIG man and copied, complete with forged German stamps and frankings, by ATS women in Cairo&quot;. Politics          &quot;Taking orders from a ruddy Kraut!&quot; exclaims a British sergeant-major, who is obliged to serve under Bergman and has sort of missed the point. &quot;What&apos;s this bleeding war coming to?&quot; SIG members feel much the same: &quot;If my father in Tel Aviv could see me here now, fighting for the British, he would take back my barmitzvah,&quot; says one. Historically, the film is right to contextualise relations between the British Empire and Palestinian Jews as uneasy during the second world war, though there&apos;s little to cling to here for viewers who aren&apos;t familiar with the history of militant Zionism and the British mandate for Palestine (the state of Israel would not be established until 1948). &quot;The days of the Wandering Jew are at an end,&quot; Bergman tells Craig. &quot;We&apos;re going home.&quot; &quot;Palestine?&quot; asks Craig. &quot;Israel, major!&quot; says Bergman. &quot;Israel! It&apos;s where we began. Anyone looking for trouble in the future will know where to find us.&quot; Spicy words. This film was made during an atmosphere of hostility in the Middle East that would spill over into the six-day war four months after its release. Film-making           As a film, Tobruk is unbalanced. An overplotted, if quite well written, first half gives way to a lengthy and underplotted battle sequence at Tobruk. The latter \u2013 though it is too long, loses the narrative thread, and deviates substantially from the real outcome of the SIG&apos;s operation \u2013 is strikingly well made. They blow up so much expensive stuff, it looks like it cost almost as much as the actual war. The film&apos;s special effects, by Howard A Anderson and Albert Whitlock, earned its only Oscar nomination (which it lost to Doctor Dolittle). In 1971, Universal Pictures brazenly reused much of Tobruk&apos;s footage in the Richard Burton B-movie Raid on Rommel. Verdict With a solid cast, some smart writing and excellent battle scenes, Tobruk is nearly a great movie \u2013 but it&apos;s just too patchy to make the grade.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-21T10:19:17Z", "title": "Tobruk: too patchy to stand out from the rank and file", "sentences": ["&quot;What&apos;s this bleeding war coming to?&quot; SIG members feel much the same: &quot;If my father in Tel Aviv could see me here now, fighting for the British, he would take back my barmitzvah,&quot; says one."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/mar/21/tobruk-reel-history"}, {"tags": ["Barack Obama", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "US foreign policy", "Middle East peace talks", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Mahmoud Abbas", "US news", "World news", "Iran", "Hezbollah", "Hamas"], "article": "President Barack Obama made a powerful and impassioned argument for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, telling an audience of young Israelis that their generation bore responsibility for securing a secure, stable and democratic future for the conflict-ridden land. In what was billed as the most important public speech ever made by an American leader on the issue, Obama delivered a tough message to Israel, saying hard choices had to be faced and risks must be taken. &quot;You can be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream, or you can face growing challenges to its future \u2026 The only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realisation of an independent and viable Palestine,&quot; he said. And in a deliberate appeal to Israeli citizens over the head of their pro-settlement, compromise-averse government, he told the mainly-student audience: &quot;Speaking as a politician, I can promise you this: political leaders will not take risks if the people do not demand that they do. You must create the change that you want to see.&quot; His unequivocal message was strong on vision but short on detail of how a deal, which has eluded the region for more than six decades, could be reached. But the emotional call for peace laid the ground for months \u2013 or years \u2013 of grinding but necessary diplomacy which secretary of state John Kerry will begin after Obama&apos;s departure from Jerusalem on Friday. The first half of the carefully crafted 50-minute speech was devoted to reassuring Israel that its security needs were paramount and paying tribute to the history of the Jewish people &quot;through countless generations&quot;. Obama repeatedly reasserted the &quot;unbreakable bonds of friendship&quot; between Israel and the United States. &quot;I want to tell you \u2013 particularly the young people \u2013 that so long as there is a United States of America, Ah-tem lo lah-vahd [You&apos;re not alone].&quot; But, he went on, &quot;the only way to truly protect the Israeli people is through the absence of war \u2013 because no wall is high enough, and no Iron Dome is strong enough, to stop every enemy from inflicting harm&quot;.  Peace was necessary, just and possible, he said. And in a direct contradiction of the oft-stated view of the Israeli leadership, he asserted: &quot;you do have a true partner&quot; in Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and prime minister Salam Fayyad.  Criticising hardliners on both sides, he said: &quot;There will always be extremists who provide an excuse to not act. And there is something exhausting about endless talks about talks, the daily controversies and grinding status quo.&quot;  Negotiations were necessary, but &quot;there is little secret about where they must lead \u2026 two states for two peoples. There will be differences about how to get there, and hard choices along the way.&quot; Palestinians, he said, &quot;must recognise that Israel will be a Jewish state, and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security. Israelis must recognise that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace, and that an independent Palestine must be viable \u2026 that real borders will have to be drawn.&quot; The president acknowledged that not everyone in the hall or beyond would agree with his message, and that scepticism on both sides abounded.  But in a direct appeal to a young generation, he said: &quot;Your voices must be louder than the extremists who would drown them out. Your hopes must light the way forward. Look to a future in which Jews, Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land. Look to the future that you want for your own children \u2013 a future in which a Jewish, democratic state is protected and accepted, for this time and for all time.&quot; He went on: &quot;There will be many voices that say this change is not possible. But remember this: Israel is the most powerful country in this region. Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world. Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is, but also the courage to see the world as it should be.&quot; Quoting Israel&apos;s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, he said: &quot;&apos;In Israel, in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.&apos; Sometimes, the greatest miracle is recognising that the world can change.&quot; Although the core of the speech focussed on the need for a peaceful resolution of the 65-year conflict, Obama was careful to address Israel&apos;s principal concerns in the region. He attacked the Jewish state&apos;s key enemies of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, echoing Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s assertions that the Iranian nuclear programme posed an existential threat to Israel. Pledging that America would do what it must to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, he said: &quot;When I consider Israel&apos;s security, I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust, faced with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iranian government that has called for Israel&apos;s destruction. It&apos;s no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat. But this is not simply a challenge for Israel \u2026 it is a danger for the entire world, including the United States.&quot; The audience, energised by an early heckler who was swiftly ejected from the hall at Jerusalem&apos;s International Convention Centre, received Obama&apos;s message with cheers, applause, whistles and several standing ovations. Outside the hall, Hagar Shilo, 23, a student at Tel Aviv university, said she was inspired by the president&apos;s words. &quot;We loved it. He did his homework, he knew our culture, he made me feel more secure.&quot; But, she added, &quot;some of us think we have a partner [for peace], some of us don&apos;t. We can&apos;t control the militants in Gaza.&quot; At least two rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel on Thursday for the first time since the end of the eight-day war in November. Michal Sever, 16, also from Tel Aviv, said: &quot;It was very touching that he sees us, he stands for us, and he says we&apos;re not alone. But he also focussed responsibility on our generation.&quot; Earlier, at a joint press conference with Obama in Ramallah, the Palestinian president reiterated that a halt to settlement expansion was the key to progress towards a two-state solution. But, he added, he had a &quot;renewed confidence that the United States \u2026 will help remove obstacles to achieving a just peace&quot;. There was no immediate official reaction from either side to Obama&apos;s address. But one Israeli government official told the Guardian: &quot;It was a very good speech. Obama is right: peace is necessary, just and possible. The question is, how do we implement this? There is only one answer \u2013 negotiations that require incredibly difficult compromises on both sides. But first we have to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.&quot; Danny Dayan, the former leaders of the Settlers&apos; Council, said Obama was &quot;less naive than four years ago, but on the core issues he&apos;s still naive. The president portrayed a utopia \u2013 peace, security, a bright future for children. The problem is that he didn&apos;t give a shred of a hint of how to achieve this. &quot;The two-state paradigm is a mirage. It&apos;s very tempting, but when you approach it, it&apos;s revealed to be no more than hot air, an optical illusion.

A high wind, known as a khamsin, blew dust from the Sahara towards the Holy Land, causing a sharp drop in visibility. As a result of the unanticipated change in the weather, Obama extended his third meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to more than two hours while Israeli police blocked roads to allow the presidential convoy to pass through south Jerusalem to Bethlehem. Obama will have had a close view of the imposing wall which snakes for miles between the biblical cities. Palestinians say its construction has strangled Bethlehem&apos;s economy and obstructed access to family, jobs and places of worship in Jerusalem. The president&apos;s visit to the fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on what is believed to be the site of Jesus&apos;s birth, lasted around 30 minutes. He was greeted by the Greek Orthodox patriarch, Theophilos III, who said: &quot;We welcome you as a messenger of peace and reconciliation.&quot; Vera Baboun, the first female mayor of Bethlehem, said Obama&apos;s visit was an opportunity to learn of the obstacles facing her city. &quot;It&apos;s important that President Obama comes and sees, as a president, and listens, because we need acts,&quot; she said. &quot;Enough is enough, I think. We waited a long time.&quot; After meeting other Christian leaders in the company of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, the presidential convoy left for Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv to fly to Jordan. Obama and Netanyahu had a final round of talks before departure, but a farewell ceremony was cut short because of the adverse weather. Earlier, the president laid wreaths at the graves of Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, and the assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. He spent an hour at Yad Vashem, Israel&apos;s Holocaust memorial. The visit, Obama&apos;s first to the Holy Land since becoming president, appeared to have succeeded in its principal aim of reassuring Israel of the &quot;unbreakable alliance&quot; between the two allies and recalibrating the hitherto frosty relationship between its leaders. Mark Regev, Netanyahu&apos;s spokesman, told reporters at the end of the trip that Israel thanked America for the special bond between the two countries. &quot;President Obama&apos;s words were warmly appreciated,&quot; he said. Following Obama&apos;s call for a renewed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu had made clear his government&apos;s commitment &quot;to a historic compromise that will end this conflict once and for all&quot;, said Regev. The president&apos;s visit had provided &quot;new impetus&quot; to move the process forward. But both sides had to play a part, he added. &quot;It is a two-way street. It&apos;s not for one side to make demands and the other side to make concessions.&quot; Talks should begin as soon as possible without preconditions. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, who accompanied Obama on the trip, is to return to Jerusalem on Saturday for a further meeting with Netanyahu. &quot;We look forward to continuing our discussions with the Americans,&quot; said Regev. &quot;I think we&apos;ll see immediate follow-up through the activities of the secretary of state.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T14:41:37Z", "title": "Barack Obama passes separation wall on road to Bethlehem", "sentences": ["We waited a long time.&quot; After meeting other Christian leaders in the company of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, the presidential convoy left for Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv to fly to Jordan."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/barack-obama-separation-wall-bethlehem"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Turkey", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Barack Obama", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Middle East peace talks", "Gaza", "Gaza flotilla", "US news"], "article": "     Barack Obama has persuaded Israel to apologise to Turkey for the loss of nine lives on board the Mavi Marmara \u2013 the lead ship in an aid flotilla trying to breach the blockade of Gaza \u2013 in a deal that paves the way for diplomatic relations to be restored between the two countries. News of the US-brokered deal came on Friday as Obama was leaving Israel at the end of his first official visit during which he was praised for an emotional speech tailored to mainstream Jewish opinion but criticised for doing nothing practical to advance stalled peace negotiations and downplaying Palestinian suffering. The apology to Turkey for the May 2010 incident had been resisted by Israel until now, despite pressure from the international community. Both are close US allies \u2013 Turkey is a member of Nato \u2013 so the president was well placed to broker the deal. According to White House officials aboard Air Force One, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu placed a call to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan while closeted with Obama in a trailer on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport in the last minutes before the president&apos;s departure for Jordan. Obama joined the call at one point. The Israeli prime minister&apos;s office said Netanyahu &quot;apologised to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to the loss of life&quot;. Erdogan accepted the apology, White House officials said. This was the &quot;first step&quot; towards normalisation of relations between the two countries, US officials said, and had been the subject of talks between Obama and Netanyahu in Jerusalem this week. Arriving in the Jordanian capital Amman Obama went into talks with King Abdullah II on the escalating crisis in neighbouring Syria as well as the prospects for reviving Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. On the Israeli-Turkish deal the president said the &quot;the timing was good&quot; to restore the ruptured relationship, though it was &quot;a work in progress&quot;. A statement from Netanyahu&apos;s office said: &quot;The two men agreed to restore normalisation between Israel and Turkey, including the dispatch of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal steps against IDF soldiers. &quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2026 expressed regret over the deterioration in bilateral relations and noted his commitment to working out the disagreements in order to advance peace and regional stability.&quot; It added: &quot;The prime minister made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional, and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life. In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Netanyahu apologised to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation.&quot; A statement released in Obama&apos;s name on Friday afternoon said: &quot;The United States deeply values our close partnerships with both Turkey and Israel, and we attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security. &quot;I am hopeful that today&apos;s exchange between the two leaders will enable them to engage in deeper co-operation on this and a range of other challenges and opportunities.&quot; The US has been deeply concerned about the deterioration in relations between its two key allies in the region since the flotilla debacle. Nine Turkish activists were killed when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara in an operation to prevent it and other ships in the flotilla from reaching Gaza. The bloody confrontation was met with a wave of international condemnation, and Israel was forced to ease its stringent blockade of the tiny Palestinian enclave. Turkey cut all diplomatic ties with Israel following the incident, and demanded that the Gaza blockade be lifted before normal relations would be restored. In Gaza, which has been ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas for almost six years, Turkey was hailed as a champion of Palestinian rights. Reconciliation talks ran into trouble recently when Erdogan called Zionism a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; and compared it to fascism. But on Friday, a senior US official,\u00a0briefing journalists on the flight from Tel Aviv to Amman, said brokering the deal become possible after Erdogan backtracked on those comments. In an interview with a Danish paper this week, Erdogan did not retract his words but said they had been misinterpreted. Netanyahu told Erdogan &quot;he had seen his interview in a Danish newspaper and that he, Netanyahu, appreciated those comments&quot;, the US official said. Asked if Obama had brokered the deal, the official said:\u00a0&quot;I think it would be accurate to say the president has been making this point to both leaders for going on a couple years now. So I think it&apos;s well known by both Turkey and Israel the importance we place on seeing these two close friends of ours have normalised relations.&quot; He added: &quot;No one is claiming that this resolves every potential difference between Israel and Turkey. I think we said, and I think they would tell you, this was an important step because one of the key things that had been dividing them was their strong differences over the Mavi Mara incident and Turkey&apos;s desire for an apology and compensation.&quot; Israel will now move ahead on existing plans to pay up to \u00a34m ($6.1m) in compensation to the dead activists&apos; families. The deal to end the rift allows Obama to claim a significant diplomatic victory from his first trip as president to Israel. While his speech to Israeli students on Thursday was widely praised, he risked accusations that he had achieved nothing of substance. There was no new plan to kickstart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, little movement on how to deal with Iran&apos;s nuclear programme and nothing concrete on Syria. But the end of the Israeli-Turkish standoff is progress. With so much turmoil and uncertainty in the region, the US wants to be able to count on Turkey and Israel working in tandem. \u00a0\u00a0 The rift created problems beyond just the symbolism. Turkey, as a member of Nato, was able to block Israeli participation in proposed multilateral exercises. The US, which backs Turkey&apos;s bid for membership of the European Union, sees it as an important player in Syria. Nato helped beef up military defences along the border last year. Before flying to Jordan, Obama visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. In the afternoon he crossed the pre-1967 &quot;green line&quot; to visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. A desert storm forced him to abandon the presidential helicopter and instead travel by road, passing through the eight-metre-high concrete wall that cuts off the West Bank city from Jerusalem. Obama&apos;s first visit to the Holy Land since becoming president appeared to have succeeded in its main aim of reassuring Israel of the &quot;unbreakable alliance&quot; with the US and recalibrating the hitherto frosty relationship between its leaders. Palestinians remained deeply sceptical about his ability to force real change. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, is to explore renewing the talks. &quot;We&apos;ll keep plugging away,&quot; Obama said in Amman. &quot;We&apos;ll see if we can make it happen.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T15:43:00Z", "title": "Netanyahu apologises to Turkish PM for Israeli role in Gaza flotilla raid", "sentences": ["But on Friday, a senior US official,\u00a0briefing journalists on the flight from Tel Aviv to Amman, said brokering the deal become possible after Erdogan backtracked on those comments."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/israel-apologises-turkey-gaza-flotilla-deaths"}, {"tags": ["World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Sport", "Football", "Ukraine", "Poland", "Holland", "Germany", "Portugal", "Israel", "Croatia", "Serbia", "Belgium", "Macedonia", "Bulgaria", "Malta", "Slovenia", "Iceland", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "Norway", "Greece", "Kazakhstan", "Albania", "Czech Republic", "Denmark"], "article": "While England and Montenegro were both winning to move further clear at the top of Group H, Ukraine climbed in to third place above Poland after a 3-1 victory in Warsaw.

As it was never a British colony, Goa has a distinct culture \u2013 it was grabbed by the Portuguese in the early days of European colonisation (India only wrestled it off them by\u00a0waging a two-day war in 1961). There is a large population of Catholics, so churches are as common as Hindu temples (and, unlike in many parts of India, the two\u00a0congregations attend each other&apos;s places of worship and also intermarry). And as the sheikh said, Goa is one of the places lucky enough to have averted sectarian violence. I was heading north up the coast from Panaji, the state capital, to a\u00a0fishing village named Mandrem. This was on the strict instructions of my old friend Neerja, who has worked in Bollywood for years. &quot;It&apos;s where we go to get away from the bustle of Mumbai,&quot; she told me. &quot;And from you bloody tourists!&quot; Before the trip, I&apos;d heard that Goa had been ruined. The wide-eyed beach parties of 20 years ago were long gone: now it was all package tours and Russians, full English breakfasts and ice buckets with bottles of vodka \u2013 or so the story went. Neerja had said that all this is pretty much true of the central resorts of Calangute, Candolim, and Baga \u2013 all within easy reach of the airport and to be given a wide berth. But the coast of Goa is surprisingly long and varied. Parts of the far north and far south are \u2013 say it quietly \u2013 almost unspoilt. On the first day in Mandrem, it was nature that made the biggest impact. The clean, endless, golden-white beach fringed with coconut palms; little waders with upturned beaks; small crabs scuttling into holes to avoid being washed out in the wake; herons with green feet; kingfishers proudly showing off their plumage; sea eagles riding on thermals; fish shoaling where a small river meets the sea; a nest of Olive Ridley turtle eggs, and their security guard dozing in the sun. I stayed at Jai Ganesh, a very unassuming guesthouse set back from the beach, run by a young local couple who offer home cooking and the best dhal on the planet. The room was cool because it was brick rather than bamboo, windowless, and came with the fan from Apocalypse Now (the effect was completed one afternoon when we were buzzed by a pair of Indian Army Hind attack helicopters). The main feature was a bright-green frog resident in the toilet \u2013 its favourite perch was under the lid, waiting for a\u00a0mosquito for dinner. But it soon became obvious that Mandrem is not a well-kept secret. It has returning holidaymakers who come for retreats teaching Vipassana meditation, or to go kite-surfing, watch the sunset while sipping cocktails at a lounge bar named Shanti, and to gawp in a nearby boutique owned by Jade Jagger. A\u00a0small contingent is a very posh lot indeed \u2013 rich, beautiful, creative types from Delhi, St Petersburg and Tel Aviv. But the majority are regular people on a budget looking for heat, light and relaxation: there were middle-aged women travelling alone from Brighton and Nottingham; Scandinavian families with young children; an American NGO worker recovering from Afghanistan. All were there to rest and not to pose. And it was cold drinks in the shade with these characters that turned out to be the most relaxing \u2013 and sometimes fascinating \u2013 pursuit in Mandrem. Apart from socialising,\u00a0there is little else to do other than stroll and swim. Sooner or\u00a0later, everyone is mesmerised by\u00a0the view and becomes content with doing very little. That said, there are increasing numbers of visitors, especially north Europeans, who migrate to Goa for stays of several months each winter and bring their jobs with them. Working remotely is feasible because Wi-Fi is ubiquitous (though it stops without warning during power cuts, which occur daily \u2013 sometimes for hours at a time).     A sunbathing cow joins fishermen and bathers on the beach. Photograph: Janne Hellsten/Getty Images/Flickr RF    Given time and the desire for variation, it is worth making the trip to southern Goa&apos;s answer to the Mandrem area \u2013 a cluster of three beaches named Palolem, Patnem and Agonda \u2013 on the Konkan Railway (konkanrailway.com) from Pernem in the north to Canacona in the south. Instead of Mandrem&apos;s endless straight sands that disappear off into the horizon, Palolem is in a\u00a0bay formed by headlands less than three miles apart (the resulting beach, a photogenic arc, was used as a\u00a0location in The Bourne Supremacy). It is also quite crowded, though not uncomfortably so. There is a wide range of accommodation, from huts made from bamboo matting that outside the December peak can be haggled down to 600 rupees (\u00a37.50) a night to plush beachfront studios made of black wood for 10 times more. I stayed right on the beach, at Rose Buds Beach Huts \u2013 in a simple wooden shack that had a cold shower, a creaky fan in the ceiling and staff with a brutal sense of banter. Small boats bearing Hindu and Catholic symbols bring in fresh fish every day. Seafront restaurants serve local catches, including pomfret, kingfish and red snapper, any way you want it. The best meal of the stay was at Papillon (papillonpalolem.com), with a table on the beach. Patnem beach, a 20-minute walk over Palolem&apos;s southern headland, offers a less-developed alternative. Agonda, 15 minutes&apos; drive north, is also a much quieter affair, with little to do other than wind down. There was a colony of furry fruit bats, hanging upside down from a\u00a0eucalyptus tree, each one keeping cool with the odd flap of a black-skinned wing, turning their snouts up at the noisy squabbles of grey langur monkeys below. While it is true that Mandrem and Palolem/Agonda/Patnem are the most peaceful patches of the far north and south, it must be said that few are insulated from the partygoers who have made Goa notorious. One lunchtime at a shack on Mandrem beach, I was chomping through a thali of curries when a friendly Moscovite calling himself Kosmo insisted on talking me through the finer details of what it is like to come down from a\u00a0three-day MDMA binge, and why so\u00a0many of his compatriots are doing this every winter. With a\u00a0direct flight from Moscow to Goa, it can feel like a\u00a0place where you are going to learn less about today&apos;s India and more about today&apos;s Russia. Apparently the mafia have arrived, and there is tension with the locals \u2013 but the Russians I met all decried the small number who are giving the rest a bad name. On the last night in Palolem I sat with my travelling companions at a\u00a0wicker table on the beach, sipping watermelon juice, looking up at the\u00a0night sky. For us Europeans, the crescent moon looked like it had become so relaxed that it had toppled over, so that both of its points\u00a0were poking straight upwards. One of us said it looked like the top of a\u00a0minaret. One of us said it looked like a gleaming white grin.

Russia has refused to extradite the chief suspect in the murder, Andrei Lugovoi, and the case continues to cause serious strain in relations with the Kremlin.

In exile he became an increasingly vocal critic of the government of Mikheil Saakashvili. After spending a year travelling between Britain and Tel Aviv, the 52-year-old suffered a fatal heart attack at his mansion in Surrey in 2008.

A quick glance at any commercially available EFL textbook reveals that a traditional grammar syllabus, the main object of Lewis&apos;s attack, is still alive and kicking, albeit more cleverly disguised. How come Lewis&apos;s ideas have not been eagerly taken up by the mainstream English Language Teaching (ELT)? Insights from research take a notoriously long time to seep into the teaching practice for all kinds of reasons. One of them, according to Penny Ur&apos;s recent opinion article in Learning English, could be that academic research is often written in an opaque, inaccessible language that doesn&apos;t make much sense to those at the chalkface. Deliberately written in a non-academic, teacher-friendly style, Lewis&apos;s 1993 volume was an attempt to introduce fascinating insights from corpus linguistics into the classroom practice. By the early 1990s, corpus research (study of samples of &quot;real-world&quot; texts), propelled by the developments in computer technology, had began to uncover interesting facts about language and how it works. Corpus research had revealed the ubiquity of multi-word phrases, lexico-grammatical patterns and generally a much closer link between grammar and vocabulary than was previously believed. To illustrate how certain grammar structures attract certain words, let&apos;s take Have you ever \u2026? which, as many teachers will know, often causes difficulty for the learner. The most common past participles that occur with this structure are: been / seen / had / heard / tried In fact, these five verbs account for more than half of all occurrences of Have you ever\u2026 in the British National Corpus. Findings such as this one underpinned Lewis&apos;s lexical approach which proposed shifting the focus from what&apos;s possible to what&apos;s probable. In other words, instead of learning abstract grammar rules and then finding the words to fill the slots, learners&apos; attention should be directed to most common, prototypical examples of grammar in use. As far as vocabulary is concerned, new vocabulary items should likewise be presented &quot;in company&quot; of other words that frequently co-occur with them: brush your teeth commit a crime generous donation fundamentally flawed In truth, Lewis&apos;s lexical approach, the core principle of which is the oft-cited dictum &quot;language consists of lexicalised grammar not grammaticalised lexis&quot; did boldly away with grammar/vocabulary dichotomy. In Lewis&apos;s view, &quot;chunks&quot; are the building blocks of language. The subsequent titles (Implementing the Lexical approach, 1997 and Teaching Collocation, 2000 \u2013 both by Cengage-Heinle) offered further insights into this new language description and pedagogical suggestions on how it translates into practice. Skeptics were not convinced. There are hundreds of thousands of chunks the learner has to commit to memory \u2013 where do we start? Opponents scoffed that it&apos;s easier to equip learners with grammar rules and set them off on a path of putting together comprehensible phrases and sentences, thus ensuring faster progress. Undoubtedly, there are thousands of chunks (just like there are hundreds of grammar rules) and even if learning them is taxing on the brain it certainly pays off in terms of fluency when you retrieve from memory whole phrases rather than stringing words together from scratch every time you want to say something. Native speakers take for granted their ability to retrieve from memory lexical chunks as individual wholes when speaking and writing, for example: It&apos;s an absolute outrage! at no extra cost I look forward to seeing you it never ceases to amaze me By some estimates, anywhere between 55% and 80% of native speaker English, depending on the genre, consists of routines and patterns that are in some way prefabricated. In fact, fluency would not be possible without recourse to a large stock of prefabricated chunks and expressions. Chunks also play a crucial role in early second language acquisition. Learners can engage in basic conversations using chunks as unanalysed wholes: Good morning! How are you? Thank you very much. And later: Where do you live? How long are you staying here? I don&apos;t like it. What are you doing? These chunks can later be used as templates to generate new utterances: What are you reading? What are you saying? What are you waiting for? Or: She told me to leave. He asked me to marry him. They want me to stay here. In the past 20 years, more and more evidence has emerged to corroborate Lewis&apos;s claims. Corpus studies have confirmed that chunks pervade our everyday language and structures which have traditionally received attention in EFL grammar pedagogy are relatively rare. Cognitive linguistics lends further credibility to the lexical approach by claiming that chunk learning can foreground acquisition of the grammar system in the second language. Learners first internalise unanalysed chunks and can then extract regularities from them, much in the same way as native speaker children master the English grammar without explicitly attending to the rules of the present perfect or past continuous. The central role of lexis in ELT has been recognised. Textbooks routinely include collocation boxes, pages with functional language and generally pay more attention to spoken language. But, clearly, Lewis was aiming at much more. If anything, the lexical approach for me is about grammar. Not the kind of carefully sequenced and fundamentally flawed presentation of discrete items but grammar as a search for patterns and regularities in language we use. Lewis&apos;s goal was to effect a radical upheaval in the way we teach language and not merely bring vocabulary to the fore. But 20 years on, it is evident that this is precisely what his lexical approach has achieved and \u2013 to finish off with a chunk \u2013 we should be grateful for small mercies. \u2022 Leo Selivan is a teacher trainer and materials developer with the British Council in Tel Aviv.

They were collected from comments in the 800 visitors&apos; books the museum has compiled since it opened in 2001, and whittled down to 32 of the most frequently asked, to form the backbone of its latest show, The Whole Truth \u2013 What You&apos;ve Always Wanted to Know About Jews (but might have been too afraid to ask, the title could have added). A high point of the exhibition, in answer to the oft-asked question &quot;Are there still Jews in Germany?&quot; comes in the form of the Jew in the Showcase, a glass vitrine in which a different Jewish man or woman sits on a pink felt cushion each day to answer the public&apos;s pressing queries in person. On Wednesday it was the turn of Dekel Peretz, a doctoral student in German Jewish history at the Moses Mendelssohn centre in Potsdam, who said he had initially been put off by fear he might feel like an act in a freak show. &quot;But my approach to it is to study the people just as they want to study me,&quot; said the 33-year-old from Ra&apos;anana near Tel Aviv. &quot;I&apos;m really intrigued to find out what sort of things they ask me. In many ways my everyday life is anyway a bit like living in a box, being one of few Jewish people living in Germany \u2013 your mere presence in a pub triggers debates about the Holocaust or Middle East politics \u2013 so I wasn&apos;t fazed about taking part.&quot; Before long he was deep in conversation with 62-year-old Eckhard Morgen and his wife, Manuela, 52, from southern Germany. &quot;We don&apos;t get much of a chance to meet Jewish people, so I was mostly interested to find out why he was so keen to be an exhibit and to talk about his Jewishness,&quot; said Eckhard Morgen. He was moved, he said, by the story of Peretz&apos;s Moroccan, Romanian and Polish family, most of whom perished in the Holocaust. Manuela Morgen said the couple would like to visit Israel, &quot;but have always been put off by the violence&quot;. But the main hindrance, said Eckhard, is of &quot;being German \u2013 I&apos;d be concerned that with older people in particular who have experience of the Holocaust it would be really hard to converse&quot;. That&apos;s one reason he had wanted to visit the exhibition, he said, and it lies at the heart of what the exhibition is about. &quot;My response to it is very emotional,&quot; Eckhard admitted. He stopped short of laughing at the Auschwitz jokes that were also part of the display, which for him &quot;stuck in the gut&quot;. Understandably, reactions to the exhibition have been mixed. Some commentators have called it naive, mawkish and voyeuristic, others daring and challenging. Martina L\u00fcdicke, one of its curators, said the main aim of it had been to &quot;trigger an interesting discussion&quot;. The trepidation with which the curators embarked on the project is expressed in their email exchanges as they developed it, which have been published. They wrangled over whether or not to include the question &quot;Is sex with Jews different?&quot; (it is included) as well as over whether it was right to put a Jewish person on display like, as one visitor put it, &quot;Eichmann in the dock in Jerusalem&quot;. &quot;I think we should do it,&quot; concluded Michal Friedlander, a London-based curator for Judaica and Applied Art at the museum in an email to her colleagues. &quot;As Churchill&apos;s parrot would say: &apos;Fuck Hitler&apos;. Lets put a living Jew in a showcase, not a dead one.&quot; As well as musings on the definition of kosher food and the Wailing Wall, there are references to David Beckham and Prince Charles, alongside Marilyn Monroe, who converted in the 1950s, and Charlie Chaplin, whose Jewish roots were said to lie in Hungary. Beckham&apos;s credentials? The tattoo on his arm of a Hebrew verse from the Song of Solomon as well as his assertions that he is half Jewish. As for Prince Charles, he was circumcised by the then royal circumcisor, Rabbi Jacob Snowman, according to a tradition brought by George I from his homeland., The move apparently prompted suggestions of a greater affinity to Jewishness than the royal family have ever openly admitted. &quot;It is all part of the debate on what it is to be Jewish,&quot; said L\u00fcdicke. &quot;People want clear definitions, but there are none.&quot; Indeed, it seems that some visitors leave the exhibition with more questions than they had when they arrived and it is questionable the extent to which some have been enlightened. Among the more than 200 sticky notes on a wall at the end marked &quot;Any more questions?&quot; visitors have written &quot;How are Jews born?&quot;, &quot;Why do Jews have peyos [side curls]&quot;, and &quot;Is it still OK to call a child Adolf?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T22:37:14Z", "title": "Jewish Museum asks questions about living history", "sentences": ["&quot;But my approach to it is to study the people just as they want to study me,&quot; said the 33-year-old from Ra&apos;anana near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/27/jewish-museum-jews-berlin-exhibition"}, {"tags": ["Jazz", "Culture", "Music"], "article": "You might be fooled, by the playful waltz that opens this set&apos;s portrayal of Vienna, or by the solemnly marching chords introducing Moscow, into thinking that volatile reeds virtuoso Gilad Atzmon has grown tired of fighting battles and finally opted for the expected.

At 9am on Tuesday morning, the 19-year-old will report, as instructed in his draft papers, to a military base near Tel Aviv. There he will state his objection to serving in the Israeli army. Following his refusal to enlist, Blanc expects to be arrested and sentenced to between 10 and 20 days in jail. He will then be taken to Military Prison Number 6 to serve his time. And then, following his release, the cycle will begin over again. The reason why Blanc knows what to expect is that this will be the eighth time the teenage conscientious objector has been jailed in the past 19 weeks. Since the date of his original call-up for military service, Blanc has spent more than 100 days in prison; on one occasion, he was released on a Tuesday and re-imprisoned two days later on a Thursday. Blanc began to consider the possibility of refusing the draft several years ago. &quot;It was a very hard decision, it took me a long time to get to it,&quot; he says. The turning point was Operation Cast Lead, the war in Gaza that began at the end of 2008 and ended three weeks later with a Palestinian death toll of around 1,400. In a statement issued when he was first imprisoned, Blanc said: &quot;The wave of aggressive militarism that swept the country then, the expressions of mutual hatred, and the vacuous talk about stamping out terror and creating a deterrent effect were the primary trigger for my refusal.&quot; The government, he said, was &quot;not interested in finding a solution to the existing situation, but rather in preserving it\u00a0\u2026 We will talk of deterrence, we will kill some terrorist, we will lose some civilians on both sides, and we will prepare the ground for a new generation full of hatred on both sides\u00a0\u2026 We, as citizens and human beings, have a moral duty to refuse to participate in this cynical game.&quot; In an interview with the Guardian, he says: &quot;The war going on in this country for more than 60 years could have ended a long time ago. But both sides are giving into extremists and fundamentalists. The occupation was supposed to be temporary, but now no one speaks of it ending.&quot; The Israeli state, he adds, keeps people &quot;under our control&quot; without democratic rights. Palestinians are subject to &quot;collective punishment&quot; for the actions of a few. Most Israelis grow up knowing that compulsory military service \u2013 three years for boys, two for girls \u2013 lies at the end of their school days. &quot;Going to the army&quot; is a deeply ingrained, collective experience in Israeli national identity. For some, it&apos;s an eagerly-anticipated patriotic duty; for others, a rite of passage; for a few, a difficult moral dilemma. But it is rare for people to refuse on grounds of conscience. Blanc says that since November, he has been the only conscientious objector among the 300-400 inmates in Military Prison Number 6. Most of his friends have come to accept his position \u2013 &quot;we had the arguments a long time ago&quot; \u2013 and some who are currently serving as combat soldiers now say they admire it. His parents, despite some anxiety, are supportive. Blanc rejected the option taken by some objectors of claiming a medical condition that would exempt him from military service. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to lie. This is a point of principle.&quot; Neither could he seek exemption of the grounds of pacifism. &quot;The army has a narrow definition of pacifism \u2013 someone who would never apply force in any circumstances. The [IDF&apos;s] conscience committee asks tough questions, and I would not be able to say never. I think force should be used rarely, but it can&apos;t be completely ruled out.&quot; Blanc is willing to undertake national service in lieu of the compulsory stint in the army, but thus far the military has refused to countenance this. In a statement, the IDF said it could not comment on Blanc&apos;s specific case, but conscription was a result of Israel&apos;s security situation. Although there were limited grounds for exemption, those called up were &quot;fully aware of their responsibilities towards the military and the consequences for failing&quot; to carry them out. Blanc hesitates when asked if he would describe himself as a patriot. &quot;I feel a strong connection to this country, and I&apos;m proud of it in many ways. But I have an aversion to nationalism.&quot; Prison life has taken some adjustment. Blanc, who shares a tent with around 20 other prisoners, is woken for roll call around 5am and works eight hours a day in the kitchen.

A three-day hunger strike by Palestinian security prisoners has been announced. Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh, 64, died on Tuesday morning, three days after being transferred to Soroka hospital in the city of Be&apos;er Sheva. Following news of his death, Israeli prison guards used teargas in response to protests by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, who banged on cell doors and threw objects. Three prisoners and six guards needed medical treatment, according to the Israeli Prison Service (IPS). There were clashes in the tense West Bank city of Hebron, where Abu Hamdiyeh lived. Demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs, according to reports. Abu Hamdiyeh, who was sentenced to life in 2002 for attempted murder, was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus several months after complaining of ill health. By the time he was transferred to hospital, the cancer had spread from his throat to his spinal cord. According to his lawyer, he had lost significant weight and, until his admission to hospital, had been treated only with painkillers. Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority prisoners minister, said Abu Hamdiyeh&apos;s cancer spread because he did not receive treatment earlier. &quot;The prison administration knew that he was suffering from cancer and they didn&apos;t release him and medically neglected him,&quot; Qaraqe told the Palestinian news agency Ma&apos;an. Sivan Weizman, a spokeswoman for the IPS, said it had initiated moves to get Abu Hamdiyeh released on compassionate grounds after his cancer was diagnosed as terminal last week. &quot;Usually it takes a few weeks to complete,&quot; she said. An earlier statement from the IPS said: &quot;The prisoner was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in February and was under the medical supervision of experts at the hospital.

The plane descends either from the west, over the glittering Mediterranean sea and the bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv, or from the east, across the stark biblical landscape of the West Bank. From there it&apos;s uphill \u2013 literally and, perhaps, metaphorically \u2013 to west Jerusalem, the seat of the Israeli government, and to Ramallah, the home of the Palestinian Authority. The US secretary of state is expected to make this journey many times in the coming months of grinding shuttle diplomacy between the two sides of the 65-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He will need stamina, patience, resourcefulness, determination; a strong sense of history, a clear grasp of the present, and a vision of the future; plus an instinct for when to tread delicately and when to diplomatically bang heads. Kerry is in the Holy Land this week, for the third time in less than a month, as part of a drive by the second-term Obama administration to get the so-called peace process back on track after the miscalculations and setbacks of Barack Obama&apos;s first term. Amid carefully lowered expectations, Kerry will strive to bridge the gaps between the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that have caused a two-and-a-half-year impasse. But a long history of failed efforts and aborted talks cannot be far from his mind. Obama&apos;s charm offensive on Israel last month went down well. During his three-day visit he showed warmth towards &quot;my friend Bibi&quot;, repeatedly using Netanyahu&apos;s nickname, in contrast to earlier chilly encounters, and paid tribute to the history and achievements of the Jewish state. He made an impassioned appeal for peace, delivered over the heads of government to the people of Israel. Look through Palestinian eyes, he said, recognise that peace is in Israel&apos;s interests, face the hard choices and take the necessary risks. The president was received with markedly less warmth in Ramallah, where the Palestinians feel betrayed by the past four years and deeply cynical about the future. Despite focusing on settlements early in his first term, Obama barely mentioned Israel&apos;s continuing colonisation project, which many diplomats say is close to eliminating the possibility of the Palestinians ever creating a viable state. There was little acknowledgement of the Palestinians&apos; painful history and bleak lives under occupation. Obama left the Holy Land with his stock higher than ever among Israelis, but even lower among Palestinians. It&apos;s now down to Kerry to try to move forward. Kerry&apos;s efforts to bring the two sides together will focus initially on measures to instil confidence in their stated commitment to negotiations. Israel may be asked to release more than 120 Palestinian political prisoners who have been in jail since before the 1993 Oslo accords. The Palestinians would also like a settlement construction freeze. Israel&apos;s formal position is that this is a non-starter, but it may avoid announcing new building projects in the next two or three months in an unstated gesture. The Palestinians have said they will refrain from pressing ahead with taking Israel to the international criminal court \u2013 a key Israeli concern \u2013 for up to 12 weeks. But they also want to see a proposed map with defined borders at the start of any talks. Kerry is believed to be keen to dust off the 11-year-old Arab (or Saudi) peace plan, under which regional states would normalise relations with Israel in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state. And he is likely to ask Turkey to play an active role in any revived process. It all seems reasonably promising on paper, but the reality on the ground looks rather different. The new Israeli government, sworn in two days before Obama&apos;s visit, is a rightwing pro-settler coalition. One of its key partners, the Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, is vehemently opposed to a two-state solution. Netanyahu also has a long track record of saying he wants peace talks while pursuing a colonialist policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. On the Palestinian side, frustration is growing at the lack of a political horizon and the continued suffocated existence under occupation. Cynicism about the &quot;peace process&quot; abounds, faith in Abbas is plummeting and the mood among young men in villages and refugee camps is growing more radical. Talk of a new Palestinian intifada (uprising) is common both on the street and in Israeli military-intelligence circles. In Gaza, perhaps the most complicated and least discussed aspect of any peace talks, rocket fire has resumed on a limited scale over recent weeks. Another conflict like those in 2008-9 and 2012 would likely derail Kerry&apos;s ambitions. Kerry will also focus on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, as well as the worsening situation in Syria and its knock-on effect in Lebanon. The secretary of state will have his hands full. &quot;It&apos;s too early to be optimistic,&quot; said a western diplomat.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-07T12:24:38Z", "title": "John Kerry returns to Middle East amid lowered expectations", "sentences": ["The plane descends either from the west, over the glittering Mediterranean sea and the bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv, or from the east, across the stark biblical landscape of the West Bank."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/07/john-kerry-middle-east-expectations"}, {"tags": ["Vincent Tchenguiz", "Business", "UK news", "World news", "Kaupthing", "Serious Fraud Office", "Law"], "article": "A private detective agency run out of Vincent Tchenguiz&apos;s offices on Park Lane \u2013 staffed by former Israeli intelligence operatives \u2013 has been thrown out by the investment tycoon in a bitter dispute over bills they presented to him.

The revelation that the Conservative party donor had spied on some of the closest members of his entourage comes two months after he kicked the intelligence experts, trading as Black Cube, out of his Park Lane office and his nearby \u00a315m home. Tchenguiz has accused them of defrauding him, while they in turn claim that he has breached a contract with them. Both deny the tit-for-tat allegations made against each side. In papers lodged at the high court, Black Cube&apos;s finance director, Avi Yanus, said: &quot;Mr Tchenguiz told [Black Cube chief executive Daniel] Zorella \u2013 as he had also indicated to me \u2013 that his alleged concerns had been based on surreptitious recordings he made of private and confidential conversations between me and Mr Zorella and conversations between other employees of Black Cube.&quot; Tchenguiz confirmed the recordings were made as part of an investigation into Black Cube&apos;s conduct. As part of its claim against Tchenguiz, Black Cube detailed the unusually close relationship that its staff had reputedly formed with Tchenguiz before the falling out. Yanus said Black Cube had been at the &quot;core of his entourage&quot; after they were drafted into his Mayfair base almost three years ago. In court filings he said: &quot;Mr Tchenguiz likes to have an entourage surrounding him and for a long period of time ... the employees of Black Cube formed the core of his entourage. He would refer to other people on the margins of his entourage as disloyal and would not let them join his private conversations or eject them from his company entirely.&quot; Black Cube was not well liked by some of Tchenguiz&apos;s other advisers, the documents state. Referring to the collapse of talks exploring a potential investment by Tchenguiz in Black Cube, Yanus said: &quot;I believe that other advisers of Mr Tchenguiz were hostile to the agreement being concluded and indeed wanted to get rid of Black Cube altogether&quot;. A spokesman for Tchenguiz said: &quot;Any hostility was well placed and justified.&quot; Originally operating out of Tel Aviv, Black Cube was drafted in to play an important role in multiple legal disputes involving Tchenguiz-linked companies, which threatened to engulf the businessman&apos;s multi-billion pound investment empire. These disputes emerged in the wake of the 2008 failure of Icelandic bank Kaupthing, from which he and his brother Robert Tchenguiz had borrowed huge sums. At one stage both brothers had been incorrectly suspected of a corrupt relationship with former Kaupthing executives, leading to now notorious raids by the Serious Fraud Office two years ago. Black Cube helped build the successful challenge to the SFO raids, which were declared unlawful last year. A judge said there had never been grounds to pursue an investigation into Vincent Tchenguiz. Search warrants used on his brother were also quashed and the SFO later abandoned that inquiry too. Since then, Vincent Tchenguiz has launched a \u00a3200m claim for aggravated and exemplary damages against the anti-fraud agency. He has also hinted that this could be the first of a series of legal actions against parties who he believes have wronged him since the failure of Kaupthing. Black Cube claim Tchenguiz regularly bragged that these actions \u2013 called Operation Athena by the businessman \u2013 could recover \u00a3500m. Yanus said: &quot;Every few weeks Mr Tchenguiz would say\u00a0\u2026 if he recovered \u00a3500m, Black Cube would receive \u00a35m.&quot; Also under consideration was a film about Tchenguiz&apos;s battle with the SFO. Black Cube claims that 1% of the film&apos;s proceeds were promised to the intelligence firm. Black Cube claim this promise was reiterated by Tchenguiz at a party held in June last year to celebrate after the SFO dropped its criminal investigation. &quot;In the course of this party, I said to Mr Tchenguiz words to the effect of: &apos;What about Black Cube?&apos; Mr Tchenguiz responded: &apos;You got your 1%&apos;.&quot; The investment tycoon was well known for large parties in Mayfair and aboard his yacht in Monaco. He was also a regular visitor to Mayfair nightclub Annabel&apos;s. Tchenguiz insists Black Cube never had an entitlement to 1% of Project Athena. According to its website, Black Cube provides &quot;creative intelligence&quot; and claims to specialise in &quot;untangling complex setbacks and creating unique business opportunities&quot;. Recordings of private conversations between Black Cube staff are understood to have been made in Tchenguiz&apos;s offices, which he shared with the intelligence experts until their departure. Tchenguiz is thought to have been advised that the surveillance was lawful, because he believed he had grounds to suspect Black Cube. It is not the first time Tchenguiz has fallen out with figures close to him and accused them of defrauding him. Last year he was embroiled in a legal dispute with his former head of IT, Keyvan Rahimian. The two had grown up as family friends in pre-revolution Iran and Rahimian lived in the Tchenguiz home for nine years before the falling out in 2008. Amid another flurry of claims and counter claims, Tchenguiz had alleged Rahimian had stolen from him. In turn, his former friend said the investment tycoon had reneged on promises to give him stakes in various investments. In evidence, Rahimian alleged he had been instructed to install &quot;spying software&quot; on the phone of an unnamed individual who he believed did not work for Tchenguiz. He described this as a &quot;hacked mobile phone&quot; and said he had installed the software on three other phones handed to him by Tchenguiz&apos;s legal team. A settlement was reached before Tchenguiz gave his side of the story to the court. Tchenguiz told the Guardian on Friday there was no truth in these allegations. During the hearing lawyers for Tchenguiz accused Rahimian of using the dispute over investments as a cover to air in open court &quot;salacious&quot; claims he thought would be embarrass him into a settlement. In particular, the lawyers pointed to a claim that money transfers had been made, using Rahimian&apos;s account, to pay for &quot;eastern European models to come to the UK&quot;. Another formerly close business partner to have had an uncomfortable exit from Tchenguiz&apos;s Park Lane offices is Nicola Horlick. Her Bramdean asset management operation was invited to base itself there at the start of 2008. But the following year Tchenguiz and Horlick had fallen out and after a high-profile row over the direction of her stock-market listed fund, in which Tchenguiz was the biggest investor, Horlick eventually lost the management contract for Bramdean Alternatives. Also in 2009, Tchenguiz was sucked into a bitter row over the hacking of private computer files belonging to his brother-in-law Vivian Imerman. The hack, which took place on nine occasions and involved vast number of documents, was instigated by Vincent&apos;s brother Robert Tchenguiz, who shared another Mayfair office with Imerman, and was part of an effort to help his sister in a divorce proceedings. In an appeal court ruling in 2010 Lord Neuberger ruled the stolen downloads could not be used by Lisa Tchenguiz Imerman, adding it seemed quite possible the affair &quot;involved breach of statutory duty and statutory crimes&quot;. He said: &quot;It would be offensive if a judge effectively sanctioned [a wife] (or her brother) hacking into her husband&apos;s computer records.&quot; Of Vincent Tchenguiz&apos;s involvement in the affair, the judge found he &quot;was aware of what was going on, and was shown copies of some of the material&quot;. Vincent Tchenguiz \u2013 who has had to prove that very serious criminal allegations against him were baseless \u2013 has received large amounts of negative press which has had an impact on his ability to do business. As part of efforts to minimise this coverage, he has used the services of Reputation.com, a firm specialising in marginalising negative internet postings as they appear on Google searches. Among the services offered by Reputation.com, according to its website, boast that &quot;by strategically influencing the volume of natural [Google] searches we can replace the negative search suggestions with positive and neutral keywords, making them seem more popular&quot;. Tchenguiz, a financial engineer who has a history of complex property investments, is known to have used the services of several private intelligence firms. As well as Black Cube, he also hired a small firm called Hermes Forensic, which included a former UK police officer, to help with his legal battles. Last December, Tchenguiz took a 20% stake in another Mayfair firm Quintel Intelligence, run by former Special Forces director Maj Gen John Holmes. He has also made investments in Israeli firm Businesscope Business Intelligence and web intelligence firm Terrogence. &quot;Vincent believes that there is money to be made \u2013 honestly \u2013 in the sector and that it represents a good business opportunity,&quot; a spokesman said.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-12T20:03:41Z", "title": "Vincent Tchenguiz 'spied on his own spies'", "sentences": ["A spokesman for Tchenguiz said: &quot;Any hostility was well placed and justified.&quot; Originally operating out of Tel Aviv, Black Cube was drafted in to play an important role in multiple legal disputes involving Tchenguiz-linked companies, which threatened to engulf the businessman&apos;s multi-billion pound investment empire."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/12/vincent-tchenguiz-black-cube"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Jordan", "Saudi Arabia", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Al-Qaida", "Bashar al-Assad", "World news", "US news", "US foreign policy"], "article": "Jordan has agreed to spearhead a Saudi-led push to arm rebel groups through its borders into southern Syria, in a move that coincides with the transfer from Riyadh to Amman of more than $1bn (\u00a3650m). It marks a significant change for Jordan, from a policy of trying to contain the spillover threat posed by the civil war across its border to one of actively aiming to end it before it engulfs the cash-strapped kingdom. Jordan&apos;s role as a conduit for arms has emerged in the past two months as Saudi Arabia, some Gulf states, Britain and the US have sharply increased their backing of some rebels to try to stop the advances of al-Qaida-linked groups among them. A push to defeat al-Qaida, rather than an outright bid to oust Syria&apos;s leader, Bashar al-Assad, is Jordan&apos;s driving force. Officials in Amman concede it heightens a risk of retaliation from its increasingly cornered neighbour. Western and Arab diplomats say Jordan is treating al-Qaida&apos;s rise in prominence as an increasing existential threat. Security figures in the kingdom also fear a boost to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, which has long been at odds with the monarchy and boycotted this year&apos;s parliamentary elections. Until this year, King Abdullah had been reluctant to take a direct stake in the Syrian crisis, opting to open Jordan&apos;s borders to refugees and defectors, but not to allow them to be used for gun-running, or a concerted attempt to topple the four-decade Assad dynasty. Jordanian, Syrian opposition and western sources say Abdullah&apos;s calculation is that the sooner the Syrian crisis is over and the more moderate elements are able to defeat Assad, the better the chances are of a moderate regime taking over in Damascus. &quot;It&apos;s a race between them [al-Qaida] and the regular rebels to Damascus,&quot; said one western official. &quot;And it&apos;s in no one&apos;s interests if al-Qaida win.&quot; Last week, Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaida-linked group at the vanguard of much of the fighting in north and east Syria, renewed a pledge of allegiance to al-Qaida&apos;s overall leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. A day earlier, the Islamic State of Iraq, the main al-Qaida current in the heartland of Arabia since the US-led invasion, claimed it was formally allied with al-Nusra. The Syrian opposition&apos;s civilian body said that it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the Jabhat al-Nusra statement. &quot;The Syrian coalition urges Jabhat al-Nusra to stay within the ranks of nationalistic Syrians, to continue its efforts in fighting the Assad regime, and in supporting and protecting the freedom of all Syrian sects,&quot; it said. Light and medium-sized weapons and funds have recently been sent across the Jordanian border to Syrian rebel groups vetted by the CIA, which has run a training programme inside Jordan since early 2012. Some of the weapons were sourced from Croatia over the past year by the Jordanian air force. While not explicitly conditional, the Saudi money is the first for Jordan in more than a year. Jordan has historically received backing from wealthy patrons in the Gulf, as well as the US. The Jordanian industry minister, Hatem al-Halawani, said at a recent conference in Qatar established to support the Syrian opposition that the amount transferred from Riyadh totalled $1.25bn. In 2011 Jordan is believed to have received $1.4bn from Saudi Arabia but in 2012 failed to gain any of the $1bn payment expected. It has had just $200m so far this year, most of which went on the aid effort. Jordan is increasingly unable to provide for the 460,000 Syrians in its refugee camps and the failure of the international community to deliver on aid pledges of $1.5bn has sharpened fears of a humanitarian catastrophe. Some MPs have even called for the borders to be closed with the government declaring the north of the country, where refugee camps have been erected, a crisis zone. Jordanian officials are aware of possible retaliation from an increasingly cornered Damascus, which this week accused Amman of &quot;playing with fire&quot; by opening its border to a military push. Last week, a government spokesman said Jordan was &quot;not part of the crisis&quot; in Syria and supported a political solution. &quot;The Jordanians are happy to channel support but they say &apos;don&apos;t put us in the frontline&apos;,&quot; said one Syrian opposition figure. &quot;They used to be afraid that Assad&apos;s intelligence system could hit back and hurt Jordan but now he is weak they feel emboldened to be more active.&quot; Syrian rebels have made significant gains in the past six weeks near Deraa, the southern town where protests in March 2011 sparked the uprising, and in the Hauran area. Jordan has closed the Quneitra crossing with Syria, near the strategically vital Golan Heights. The Guardian reported last week that Austria, the lead component of the UN peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights, was considering withdrawing its troops, which would likely make the UN force&apos;s position untenable. Austria&apos;s foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger, spoke to commanders on the Golan Heights on Thursday and later confirmed Vienna may pull out its troops, especially if European states lift an embargo on supplying arms to rebels. A vacuum in the Golan Heights would pose a dilemma for Israel, which is already dealing with the withdrawal of thousands of Syrian troops from the area. Officials in Israel and Europe have suggested that if the Austrians withdrew, Tel Aviv would be tempted to cross the ceasefire line and establish a buffer zone inside Syria, adding another regional dimension to the crisis. Syrian forces are believed to have retreated to defend the capital, which despite being under siege by rebel groups, al-Nusra among them, is at no imminent risk of falling. One western diplomat cautioned that recent gains in the south, though dramatic on paper, would slow as rebels edge towards the capital. &quot;It was the same in the north,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;The heady rush into Aleppo last August has led to a stalemate ever since. I&apos;m not sure the southern border is going to soon change the equation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-14T15:03:24Z", "title": "Syria: Jordan to spearhead Saudi Arabian arms drive", "sentences": ["Officials in Israel and Europe have suggested that if the Austrians withdrew, Tel Aviv would be tempted to cross the ceasefire line and establish a buffer zone inside Syria, adding another regional dimension to the crisis."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/14/syria-jordan-spearhead-saudi-arms-drive"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The European Union must take &quot;immediate and concrete steps&quot; to secure the release of a Palestinian prisoner in an Israeli jail who has been refusing food for almost nine months and is in a critical condition, a senior Palestinian official has demanded. In a letter to Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, Saeb Erekat said the life of Samer Issawi &quot;hangs in the balance&quot; and warned his death could result in serious violence and damage efforts to revive the peace process. &quot;The fate of Mr Issawi is being followed very closely by millions of Palestinians, Arabs and supporters of justice worldwide. The situation is potentially explosive and any harm that comes to him will undoubtedly lead to a serious eruption of violence that will make any sort of political progress unlikely,&quot; wrote Erekat on the eve of Prisoners&apos; Day, marked by Palestinians on Wednesday. He added: &quot;Should Mr Issawi die, we will\u00a0\u2026 hold the international community partly responsible for its tolerance of Israel&apos;s appalling actions which have created this terrible situation.&quot; Three thousand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails refused meals to mark Prisoners&apos; Day. Issawi was arrested on 7 July 2012 at a checkpoint and was accused of being in breach of the terms of his release from jail in October 2011 as part of the prisoner swap deal that secured the release from captivity of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Issawi had been sentenced in April 2002 to 30 years in prison for membership of an illegal organisation, attempted murder and possession of explosives. Since his arrest, he has been held without charge, although he has appeared at special hearings at which any evidence against him has not been disclosed. Issawi began refusing food on 1 August last year, his mother Laila told the Guardian last month. Her son \u2013 who is in the Kaplan hospital in Tel Aviv \u2013 was taking water, vitamins and infusions, she said. &quot;I am forbidden from seeing him. I last saw him in court in February but I wasn&apos;t allowed to speak to him. All I could see was skin and bone. &quot;Nothing inside him is functioning. His kidneys are not right, his heart is not right, he has headaches all the time, he can&apos;t take himself to the bathroom.&quot; Issawi has lost at least 45kg in weight, and his heart rate has slowed to 28 beats a minute, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners&apos; rights organisation. It said his lawyers had been banned from visiting him in hospital. Sivan Weizman, spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Service, said Issawi&apos;s condition was stable. She declined to give further details. His case has generated widespread support and clashes across the West Bank. &quot;Samer has put the prisoners&apos; issue on the table. He shows the whole world that thousands of Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli jails unjustly,&quot; said Laila Issawi. Almost 5,000 Palestinian prisoners are held in 27 Israeli jails and detention centres, according to the Palestinian Prisoners&apos; Club. They include more than 100 who have been in prison for more than 20 years, and 235 children. About 200 are &quot;administrative detainees&quot;, prisoners held without charge, including 14 elected members of the Palestinian legislature. The issue of prisoners is a visceral one among Palestinian families, nearly all of whom have experienced the jailing of a relative. Of Laila Issawi&apos;s eight children, six \u2013 including a daughter \u2013 have spent time in prison, and a seventh was shot dead aged 16 by Israeli soldiers. Laila Issawi, 65, spent six months in prison in the 1970s accused of &quot;supporting terrorism&quot; after treating wounded militants as a nurse. Earlier this month, there were clashes and protests in the West Bank following the death from cancer of a 64-year-old prisoner, Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh. Palestinian officials accused Israel of negligence in his diagnosis and treatment. In a message to Israeli activists and intellectuals, posted last week on Facebook, Issawi wrote: &quot;I invite you to visit me in the hospital and see me as a skeleton handcuffed to the bed. Three exhausted jailers around me eat and drink by my bed. The guards follow my pains and gradually growing weight loss. Occasionally they look at their watches and ask: &apos;How can such a body have anything left to survive?&apos; &quot;I haven&apos;t heard a single one of you intervene and try to silence the voice of the growing death as all of you have turned into gravediggers, wearing military uniforms: the judge, writer, intellectual, media, merchant, academic, poet. I am unable to believe that an entire society has turned into the jailers of my death and life, to the protectors of the settlers who are pursuing my dreams.&quot; A group of intellectuals, including the celebrated authors Amos Oz and AB Yehoshua, pleaded with Issawi to end his hunger strike. &quot;We are horrified by your deteriorating condition,&quot; the message said. We feel that the suicidal act you are about to commit will add another facet of tragedy and desperation to the conflict between the two peoples, a conflict that peace-seekers on both sides wish to end. Please, Samer Issawi, don&apos;t pile more despair on the despair already in existence.&quot; In an article published by the Guardian last month, Issawi wrote that his hunger strike was &quot;my last remaining stone to throw at the tyrants and jailers in the face of the racist occupation that humiliates our people\u00a0\u2026 If I die, it is a victory; if we are liberated, it is a victory, because either way I have refused to surrender to the Israeli occupation, its tyranny and arrogance.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-17T09:36:16Z", "title": "EU urged to secure Palestinian prisoner's release from Israeli jail", "sentences": ["Her son \u2013 who is in the Kaplan hospital in Tel Aviv \u2013 was taking water, vitamins and infusions, she said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/17/palestinian-prisoner-israeli-jail"}, {"tags": ["Poland", "Holocaust", "Second world war", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "It was only after her grandmother&apos;s death that Maniucha Bikont discovered the full extent of her secret. Lea Horovitz had decided to escape incarceration in Warsaw&apos;s Jewish ghetto in 1940 after overhearing two shopkeepers comment &quot;she doesn&apos;t look like a zduva&quot; (a &quot;yid&quot;) on spotting the Star of David on her coat. &quot;She realised in that moment she should rip off her badge and buy a new identity,&quot; says 26-year old Bikont, sitting in a cafe in central Warsaw as she retells her grandmother&apos;s extraordinary, but by no means unique, tale. And so it was that Horovitz survived Nazi-occupied Warsaw hiding behind the make-believe persona of Wilhelmina Skulska, who went on to become a successful writer of detective novels. Her daughter Anna \u2013 Bikont&apos;s mother \u2013 was well into her 30s when she accidentally stumbled across the truth. But Wilhelmina, by now well assimilated and scared of yet again becoming a victim of repeated postwar antisemitic campaigns, refused to discuss the matter. And when the first Jewish kindergarten in Warsaw since the war opened in 1991, she strongly disapproved of the fact that Bikont was among the first &quot;intakes&quot;. &quot;She had suffered so much because she was Jewish I think she felt she had to do everything to stop her children and grandchildren from suffering the same way. She had spent all her life escaping from her Jewishness,&quot; says Bikont. &quot;Suddenly, there was I, her granddaughter, coming home from kindergarten singing Jewish nursery rhymes.&quot; Around 90% of the 3.3 million Jews in Poland at the start of the second world war were killed. In the 90s, says Katka Reszke, author of Return of the Jew, an account of 50 Jews in post-Holocaust Poland, &quot;many experts were predicting the end of Polish Jewry&quot;. The end never came. In 2002, 1,133 Poles identified themselves as Jews. By 2011, that figure had leapt to 7,508, although experts estimate that there are as many as 20,000 people with Jewish roots. And on Friday, Poles took the latest step in the fragile attempts to revive the spirit of what was once the largest Jewish community in the world, with the opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. The gleaming landmark institute, built on the site of the former ghetto and facing the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising \u2013 the 70th anniversary of which was also marked on Friday \u2013 has the potential to be on a par with Yad Vashem and Washington&apos;s Holocaust Memorial Museum in scale and importance. &quot;It is certainly not the end,&quot; says Reszke, 35, who unexpectedly discovered her own roots when she was 17. &quot;We&apos;re here. We&apos;re having babies.&quot; She calls the new wave &quot;generation unexpected&quot;. Bikont, a music anthropologist who travels around eastern Europe in search of long-lost folk \u2013 often Jewish \u2013 music, is part of a new, unforeseen generation that has emerged in Poland since the fall of communism in 1989. &quot;It is an important part of my identity even though I sometimes feel rather unusual, being one of the few people I know in this homogenous overwhelmingly Catholic land who hasn&apos;t been baptised,&quot; she says, sitting in Tel Aviv, one of her favourite cafes in central Warsaw. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a Toronto-born ethnographer who is responsible for the permanent exhibition of the almost 1,000-year history of Jews in Poland, says she hopes it will &quot;form part of a cultural itinerary&quot; and &quot;broaden the historical perspective&quot; of the many visitors who come to Poland in search of their Jewish heritage. &quot;The majority of organised groups,\u00a0and especially young people, come for the Holocaust and only the Holocaust. The museum has a very important role to play in changing their itinerary,&quot; she says. Volunteers were out on the streets of Warsaw handing out yellow paper flowers \u2013 daffodils that also deliberately resembled the Star of David badges Jewish ghetto residents were forced by the Nazis to wear \u2013 to commemorate the uprising anniversary. Inside the sand-coloured interior with its undulating passageway and glass panels, dignitaries including rabbis and Jewish scholars from around the world as well as survivors of the ghetto uprising \u2013 in which in 1943 thousands of residents rose up against the Nazis in a stand-off that lasted for almost a month, and a year later inspired the Warsaw Uprising \u2013 mingled to hear classical music and commemorative speeches in rooms that smelt of fresh paint and varnish. Yet in the 20 years it has taken for the museum to be realised, smaller groups have been taking steps towards what some call a revival of Jewish life, and others prefer to describe as a delicate reconnection with it. As well as the reopening of synagogues and Jewish theatres, an annual Jewish festival in Krakow and Warsaw&apos;s Singer theatre festival, citizen&apos;s initiatives have been launched to look after the thousands of Jewish cemeteries across the country, while choirs have been reviving Jewish music. This has all contributed to reshaping the long-standing image of\u00a0 Poland as a massive Jewish graveyard, the site of all the Nazi extermination\u00a0camps. Malgorzata Sledziewska, the deputy head teacher at the humanist Jacek Kuron secondary school in Warsaw says it is part the school&apos;s individual attempt to &quot;pick up the threads of forgotten history in a country that was ethnically-cleansed&quot;, that it is offering pupils Yiddish lessons. &quot;The take-up is strong,&quot; she says. On Poznanska street, the Tel Aviv cafe opened in 2010. Its owner, Malka Kafka, who is Jewish and in her late 30s, says she opened it out of a desire &quot;to be openly Jewish&quot; and to dispel certain myths held by some Poles, about Jews with whom they have little contact. &quot;It was to say &apos;Hi, we are here and this is more or less how our life looks&apos;. It&apos;s not side curls and robes and guys in beards, like the Polish stereotype,&quot; she insists. The need to dispel stereotypes and encourage Poles to recognise their Jewish past was underlined by a recent survey published by the daily Rzeczpospolita, in which 61% of the 1,250 17- to 18-year-olds polled, said they would be unhappy if they discovered their boyfriend or girlfriend were Jewish, while 45% said they would prefer not to have a Jew in the family and 44% would not like to have a Jewish neighbour. &quot;I am shocked, especially when you consider that we&apos;re talking about Warsaw youths, who travel widely these days, but I think it&apos;s an expression of how much of the history of Jews in Poland has been obfuscated,&quot; says Jan Gross, a Polish historian at Princeton University, who has often been vilified by Poles for daring to confront them with their own sinister chapters of antisemitism. Krystyna Budnicka, a survivor of the ghetto who was smuggled out via its sewer system but lost her entire family, insists she has seen a shift in attitudes towards Jews. &quot;At least from a political point of view it is improper to be an antisemite, but it will be harder to change the wider mentality, despite the tragedy of the Shoah,&quot; says the 81-year-old, who also assimilated after the war to ensure her survival. She welcomed the symbolism of solidity and renewal offered by the museum for modern Warsaw as she viewed the former ghetto site from the window of her 14th-floor apartment and recalled how the entire city was burnt to the ground by the Nazis. &quot;The entire topography of Warsaw changed. There is nothing left of my childhood Warsaw, nothing to which I have a connection,&quot; she says. &quot;My kindergarten, my school, our house \u2013 even the streets they were on \u2013 all gone. The only place I can go to where I am not disoriented is the graves where my grandparents are buried. At least when I go there, I know for sure that my parents would have once stood there.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-20T14:37:55Z", "title": "Poland's young Jews pick up the threads of history", "sentences": ["&quot;It is an important part of my identity even though I sometimes feel rather unusual, being one of the few people I know in this homogenous overwhelmingly Catholic land who hasn&apos;t been baptised,&quot; she says, sitting in Tel Aviv, one of her favourite cafes in central Warsaw.", "On Poznanska street, the Tel Aviv cafe opened in 2010."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/20/generation-unexpected-poland-jews"}, {"tags": ["Lionel Shriver", "Fiction", "Books", "UK news"], "article": "Most novelists go to great lengths to convince readers that their work is not autobiographical. Not Lionel Shriver. Her latest novel, Big Brother, out next month, is about a sister trying to rescue a man who is eating himself to death. Topical? Sure. In the UK, health problems associated with being overweight cost the NHS \u00a35bn a year. But a bit too close to the bone? Shriver&apos;s own &quot;big brother&quot;, Greg, died of obesity-related causes four years ago at the age of 55. Ever since Shriver won the Orange prize for We Need to Talk About Kevin in 2005, her name has been synonymous with brutal honesty in fiction and mesmerising eccentricity in real life. But with her latest one, is this self-examination through fiction taken a step too far? Without any knowledge of Shriver&apos;s own life, Big Brother is an entertaining, gripping, intelligent story. But just before the end, it has an astonishing, jaw-dropping moment when the novelist pulls away the curtains and\u00a0lets\u00a0you see right into something that looks dangerously like her own life.\u00a0It&apos;s a shockingly frank and bold move, one that has already divided early readers. For Shriver, 55, this book surely represents some kind of wish-fulfilment \u00a0in novel form. Shriver says she did not have the chance to &quot;save&quot; her brother. By the time she realised that she could have staged an intervention, it was too late. She wrote of her older brother: &quot;He&apos;s topping 330lb: 24 stone. He was once 5ft 7in tall, but his vertebrae have compressed and, at 5ft 3in, I now look him straight in the eye. I used to look up to him in every sense. I ended our last two visits in tears. My brother breaks my heart. He&apos;s obscenely smart ... but he&apos;s also, sadly, a good test case for the claim that one can be &apos;healthy at every size&apos;.&quot; Within hours of her filing that article in 2009, she learned that her brother had died of cardiac arrest in New York, following a sudden respiratory crisis. But this novel is also something of a mid-career test for Shriver. Her recent novels have had mixed reviews. So Much For That, a story of one family&apos;s struggle with the American healthcare system, was judged preachy. The New Republic, a novel about terrorism written before 9/11 but published many years later, was slammed (&quot;...flails ineffectually, never quite finding a juicy enough target&quot;). But Big Brother, like Kevin, can only serve to fuel the cult of personality that has grown up around Shriver, a figure of fascination whose makeup-free complexion has become the female equivalent of Tom Wolfe&apos;s statement white suit. Shriver is a person of iron will and self-discipline, especially over food, exercise and her daily writing schedule. She let herself go once in the past, she has said, when she was 18. &quot;I basically did the pastry tour of Britain. It&apos;s amazing how much weight you can put on if you just eat cream puffs. That was cautionary: &apos;Oh, I see, you&apos;re not immune.&apos; That has not happened again.&quot; Shriver comes across as bizarre in interviews. She has said that this is because she is female. Male authors are not painted as eccentric. She wears gloves and a coat indoors to save on heating bills. She cycles everywhere, runs nine miles at night, every other day, and performs a series of exercises (&quot;130 press-ups in two sets, 200 side crunches, 500 sit-ups and 3,000 star jumps&quot;). She has coffee for breakfast and then eats nothing until 11pm. She writes standing up. Philip Roth does this too, however, and everyone reads it\u00a0as a mark of genius. And no one teases\u00a0Haruki Murakami about his running. So is she really that weird? Or just a woman? She wears the gloves because she suffers from a circulatory condition called Raynaud&apos;s phenomenon. An ascetic lifestyle seems naturally to feed her writing output. Even her frugality seems born of habit rather than of oddness. Before We Need to Talk about Kevin, she was a struggling, unknown writer who published six novels over a period of three decades, which were more or less completely ignored. Kevin was rejected by 30 publishers. You might be wary about success if that had happened to you. Fans of Shriver \u2013 as a person as well as an author \u2013 love her because she is uncompromising, genuine and refuses to be &quot;nice&quot; for the sake of it. Her detractors find her pretentious, difficult, &quot;self-obsessed&quot;. &quot;This is the other word that follows me, that I&apos;m &apos;scary&apos;. I don&apos;t attempt to be scary,&quot; she once said. A lot of the evaluation of her is, arguably, misogynist: she has been described as having a &quot;mannish intellect&quot;, chastised for not being sufficiently modest about her literary success and made to feel, in her\u00a0own words, that she is &quot;a bitch for not having children&quot;. She has many\u00a0traits that would be seen as laudable in a man: &quot;Whereas if it&apos;s a woman, it&apos;s neurotic.&quot; The thing about Shriver is that she is bold and funny. When describing herself in advance to an interviewer so that she would be recognisable, Shriver told the journalist she would arrive looking &quot;short and badly dressed with dirty blond hair&quot;. She says she is a hermit and &quot;culturally lazy&quot;, but also speaks of a passion for Downton Abbey, Desperate Housewives and Mad Men. Not very many people \u2013 least of all, award-winning American writers \u2013 would publish a novel that is basically about snooker (The Post-Birthday World) and references, as a recurring motif, the 1986 Chas &amp; Dave hit Snooker Loopy, quoting it with relish: &quot;Snooker loopy, nuts are we, we&apos;re all snooker loopy.&quot; Shriver was born and raised in North Carolina. Her father was a Presbyterian minister and, later, a theology professor and president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York. The middle of three children (she also has a surviving younger brother), there were family prayers and Bible readings over dinner. At the age of eight, she decided that she\u00a0did not want to have children of her\u00a0own. When she was 12, she announced she would not be going to church any more. Her father dragged her into the car by her hair. &quot;I have a rebellious streak a mile wide,&quot; she says,\u00a0&quot;and admire people who get away with things.&quot; She changed her birth name Margaret Ann to Lionel when she was 15: &quot;I was a tomboy. I grew up with brothers. So I chose a boy&apos;s name.&quot; She does at least have a sense of humour about this too. &quot;A friend tells me that if I am so perverse as to change my name to Lionel, then I deserve the tedium of having to explain it to everyone I meet.&quot; She has said that it is &quot;moderately true&quot; that &quot;maybe&quot; she wanted to be a boy. &quot;Not because, as British papers have crudely abbreviated, &apos;I thought men lead better lives&apos;, but because I hated wearing dresses as a kid.&quot; She regards it as a point of pride that she has been an American expat since 1985, but she returns to New York every summer. Before settling in London 14 years ago, she spent time in Nairobi, Bangkok and Tel Aviv, before living in Belfast for 12 years. In recent years, she has permitted herself to buy a house in south-east London. (She had previously said that owning a house goes against her frugal nature.) She married Jeff Williams, seven years her senior, in Las Vegas in 2003. He is a jazz drummer, which must have come in handy when she was researching the obese brother in the novel (Big Brother&apos;s Edison is a jazz pianist). Amusingly, Williams&apos;s ex-wife was the agent who used the word &quot;evil&quot; when rejecting We Need to Talk about Kevin. As a protagonist, Kevin was, the agent wrote to Shriver, &quot;one kid from hell who will make people sick just reading about the things he does. Don&apos;t make him a mass murderer.&quot; Shriver was instructed to pay her photocopying bill and rewrite the novel &quot;with a lot more humour&quot;. (Shriver dumped this agent before she met Williams.) One of her greatest joys in life is sitting down to dinner with her husband and shouting at Jeremy Paxman on the television after a long day&apos;s writing. As she recently explained in an interview: &quot;Our idea of celebration is to sit down with our bowl of popcorn and watch Newsnight, and we have a very nice dinner with a bottle of wine and often talk at the table until two in the morning. What more do you want? To me, this is\u00a0great.&quot; Whatever you think of Shriver, perhaps the best thing about her is that\u00a0she\u00a0really doesn&apos;t care. &quot;I have not\u00a0had British or American male authors make any effort to include me in their social circle,&quot; she explained. &quot;I should add that this is hardly keeping me up nights.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-20T23:06:11Z", "title": "Lionel Shriver: time to talk about  her big brother | Observer profile", "sentences": ["Before settling in London 14 years ago, she spent time in Nairobi, Bangkok and Tel Aviv, before living in Belfast for 12 years."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/apr/21/lionel-shriver-profile-big-brother"}, {"tags": ["Vincent Tchenguiz", "Kaupthing", "Business"], "article": "Mayfair investment tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz has settled a dispute with a band of former Israeli intelligence operatives who had been at the heart of his activities. The intelligence experts, trading as Black Cube, became important figures in Tchenguiz&apos;s inner circle as he pursued international legal claims after the failure of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing in 2008, an event that threatened much of his business empire. It emerged last week that Tchenguiz, a Conservative party donor, had thrown Black Cube staff out of his Park Lane office and nearby \u00a315m home in February, accusing them of &quot;a wholesale fraud \u2026 for a prolonged period&quot;. They, in turn, claimed he had breached a contract and left \u00a3330,000 in bills unpaid. Last week the Guardian revealed his employees had secretly recorded private discussions between senior Black Cube executives, attempting to build evidence of alleged fraud. Tchenguiz had filed a legal claim in Israel against them; meanwhile, Black Cube lodged a claim in the British courts against him. A hearing to determine where the claims and counterclaims should be heard had been due to take place in London on Monday morning, but was called off at the last minute when a settlement was reach at the weekend and the lawsuits dropped. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but include an undertaking not to discuss further details with the media. Lawyers for Tchenguiz said in court filings that \u00a3820,000 had been paid to Black Cube over 13 months, suggesting this sum was provided for &quot;open source intelligence&quot;. Black Cube describes itself as providing creative intelligence, and operates out of London and Tel Aviv. Vincent and his brother, Robert Tchenguiz, had been among the biggest borrowers from Kaupthing and, with the help of Black Cube, they fought a series of disputes over what loan collateral they should surrender to the bank&apos;s administrators. At issue had been interests in Vincent Tchenguiz&apos;s \u00a32bn UK residential property ground rent portfolio and the company once behind Peverel property management operations. Stakes Robert Tchenguiz had built in J Sainsbury and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, as well as proceeds from the \u00a31.56bn sale of Somerfield supermarkets, had also been claimed as loan security by Kaupthing administrators. Black Cube also helped successfully demonstrate that a Serious Fraud Office corruption case \u2013 examining the brothers&apos; relationship with former senior Kaupthing bankers \u2013 was flawed and that grounds for suspecting Vincent Tchenguiz were entirely misunderstood and baseless.

Brigadier-General Itai Brun, head of military intelligence research at the Israeli Defence Forces, told a security conference in Tel Aviv that the lack of international response to the use of a chemical suspected to be the nerve gas sarin was a &quot;very worrying development&quot;. He said: &quot;There&apos;s a huge arsenal of chemical weapons in Syria. Our assessment is that the [Assad] regime has used and is using chemical weapons.&quot; Although the Pentagon and state department insisted on Tuesday there was no appetite for intervention in Syria, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, speaking at a Nato meeting in Brussels, called on the alliance to make preparations to respond in the event of chemical weapons endangering one of its members, Turkey. Brun cited photographs of victims that showed them foaming at the mouth and with contracted pupils as signs that gas had been used. &quot;To the best of our understanding, there was use of lethal chemical weapons. Which chemical weapons? Probably sarin,&quot; Brun told a conference organised by the Institute for National Security Studies. He specifically referred to 19 March among &quot;a number of incidents&quot; in which chemical weapons had been used by the regime, and criticised the lack of response by the international community. &quot;The regime has increasingly used chemical weapons,&quot; Brun said.&quot;The very fact that they have used chemical weapons without any appropriate reaction \u2013 this is a very worrying development, because it might signal that this is legitimate.&quot; The British and French governments said in letters last week to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, that there was credible evidence Syria had used chemical weapons since December in or near the cities of Homs, Aleppo and Damascus. On Tuesday, the White House expressed concern about the Israeli report, but Barack Obama&apos;s press spokesman, Jay Carney, said US intelligence had not yet independently confirmed the Israeli assessment. Carney said the president had made clear that the use of chemical weapons or the transfer of them to a neighbouring country \u2013 such as Lebanon, though he did not name it \u2013 would be &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Obama has portrayed the use of chemical weapons as a &quot;red line&quot; that would require intervention. However, it is not clear what action the US could take without risking unleashing lethal chemicals and endangering civilians in Syria and, potentially, neighbouring countries. While he refused to rule out the Israeli claim and similar ones from the British and French governments that chemical weapons had been used, Carney said the US is supporting a UN investigation into the possible use of such weapons by Syria. Kerry, at a press conference in Brussels, said the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu had not confirmed Brun&apos;s assertion. &quot;I talked to \u2026 Netanyahu this morning. I think it is fair for me to say that he was not in a position to confirm that in the conversation that I had. I don&apos;t know yet what the facts are.&quot; Kerry urged Nato to prepare responses in case chemical weapons became an issue. He said: &quot;Planning regarding Syria, such as what [Nato] has already done, is an appropriate undertaking for the alliance. We should also carefully and collectively consider how Nato is prepared to respond to protect its members from a Syrian threat, including any potential chemical weapons threat.&quot; Following an incident on 19 March near Aleppo, President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime claimed that opposition forces used chemical weapons against its troops. State television claimed that more than 30 people had been killed in an attack near the northern city after &quot;terrorists fired rockets containing chemical materials&quot;. Opposition activists said regime forces had fired poison gas, hitting their own troops and nearby civilians. A second attack reportedly involving chemical weapons on 19 March took place near Damascus. Reuters quoted a Geneva-based independent consultant on chemical and biological weapons arms control, Ralf Trapp, who said the symptoms described by Israeli intelligence were &quot;consistent with sarin gas,&quot; but photographic evidence alone was not conclusive. &quot;There is a limit to what you can extract from photograph evidence alone,&quot; he told the news agency. &quot;What you really need is to get information from on the ground, to gather physical evidence and to talk to witnesses as well as medical staff who treated victims.&quot; Israel has repeatedly warned of the risks of Syria&apos;s stockpiles of chemical weapons falling into the hands of the regime&apos;s Lebanese allies Hezbollah or jihadist groups embroiled in the two-year civil war inside Syria. In January, Israeli military planes attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons that it said were being transferred to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The attack also damaged a site near Damascus believed to be a chemical and biological weapons research facility. Last week, Netanyahu, said Israel would defend itself if Syria&apos;s chemical weapons and anti-aircraft weapons fell into the hands of Hezbollah or jihadists. &quot;We are prepared to defend ourselves if the need arises and I think people know that what I say is both measured and serious,&quot; he told the BBC. Brun echoed Netanyahu&apos;s comments at Tuesday&apos;s conference, saying: &quot;We have to be very bothered by the possibility that chemical weapons are going to get into the hands of less responsible actors \u2026 It is certainly possible that there will be other incidents of attack against Israel by other organisations that obtain different types of weapons.&quot; The Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, while stressing that there has been no call for the organisation to intervene, said the alliance is &quot;extremely concerned about the use of ballistic missiles in Syria and the possible use of chemical weapons&quot;. Kerry at the weekend announced that the US is to double its non-lethal assistance, including military equipment, to the Syrian opposition. Both US and Nato officials have said repeatedly they do not want to be sucked into the civil war but they might be be forced to if chemical weapons became a threat to Turkey or spilled over into a country such as Lebanon. The Pentagon and the state department, in separate briefings on Tuesday, played down the chances of any imminent intervention and stressed that so far there has been no conclusive evidence of chemical weapons being used. A Pentagon spokesman, George Little, said in a statement the US was continuing to assess reports of chemical weapons use in Syria. &quot;The use of such weapons would be entirely unacceptable. We reiterate in the strongest possible terms the obligations of the Syrian regime to safeguard its chemical weapons stockpiles, and not to use or transfer such weapons to terrorist groups like Hezbollah,&quot; he added. One Pentagon assessment is that it would require 70,000 troops to mount an intervention in Syria.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-23T13:50:00Z", "title": "Israeli general: Syrian 'regime has used and is using chemical weapons'", "sentences": ["Brigadier-General Itai Brun, head of military intelligence research at the Israeli Defence Forces, told a security conference in Tel Aviv that the lack of international response to the use of a chemical suspected to be the nerve gas sarin was a &quot;very worrying development&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/23/syrian-regime-chemical-weapons-israeli"}, {"tags": ["Science funding crisis", "Science", "US news"], "article": "A colleague at my institution recently invited a scientist with a &quot;foreign-sounding&quot; name to deliver a seminar. Foreign, yes, but not to my ears \u2013 immediately I knew that this was an Israeli. As fate would have it, not only did I recognise the name as Israeli, but I recognised the name \u2013 and remembered the face. It turns out that the invited speaker, now a faculty member and independent researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island, did his undergraduate studies with me a quarter of a century ago (that sounds awful!) in Jerusalem at the Hebrew University. While this was certainly an interesting twist of fate \u2013 small world, smaller scientific world \u2013 it puts the spotlight on the issue dubbed as &quot;the brain drain&quot;. In addition to his regular neuroscience seminar at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, my long-lost acquaintance and I agreed to participate in a discussion entitled &quot;Academics without borders: Israeli scientists in the US&quot;, sponsored by the Schwalb Center for Israel and Judaic Studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), and hosted by Dr Curtis Hutt (Religious Studies, UNO) and Dr. Moshe Gershovitz (History Department, UNO).  Dr Gilad Barnea gave a superb and very entertaining overview of the topic, peppered with humorous stories from personal experiences. He discussed, for example, his positive scientific interactions with a religious Muslim woman, and how common goals in science allow the bridging of geopolitical gaps. If I had to summarise his talk in a sentence or two, I would characterise it as an accurate depiction of the international flavor of science. He highlighted the truly international and collaborative nature of &quot;science without borders&quot;. My humble job at this event was to serve as &quot;respondent&quot;, and given the clarity of the main talk, I had an easy job in merely saying a few words to reinforce Gilad&apos;s ideas. Behind the international nature of science itself, of course, are the people. So it&apos;s important to note that approximately two-thirds of all Israeli scientists work outside Israel (and there are more Israeli faculty in the US than in Israel). That&apos;s a serious issue for a small country whose primary resource is in its &quot;hi-tech&quot; and &quot;research and development&quot; output. How did this situation occur? According to Dr Dan Ben-David, Professor of Public Policy at Tel Aviv University, as a young country Israel realised the importance of education and academics, and between 1948 and the mid-70s, Israel managed to reach the same proportion of teaching and research staff per capita as the US. However, between 1978 and 2005, while the US increased its proportion by 29%, Israel dropped investment by 35%. This goes a long way to explaining Israel&apos;s brain drain. However, the issue of brain drain is not restricted to Israel and has negatively affected a huge number of countries across the globe \u2013 and greatly benefited science in the US. At least until now. When I was a postdoctoral fellow (1998\u20132003) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), international scientists who came to work at the NIH were given special visas that stipulated that after five years of training, the scientist would be required to return to his/her home country for two full years. Unless: a) The scientist had a scientific job offer in the US, and, b) The home country provided a letter waiving the requirement of the scientist to return to their home country. This ensured that the blame for any brain drain could not be dropped onto the lap of the US government, because without that waiver letter from the home country, the US government could not keep the foreign scientists in this country. At that time in the early 2000s, to the best of my understanding (in speaking with many international postdocs from different countries), most postdocs had no trouble getting such waivers. In fact, back then, I think only Chinese postdoctoral fellows met with some resistance (and since that time, it appears that the resistance has been dropped). However, I managed to undergo my own desperate drama along the way. Although I was born in the US, it was coincidental \u2013 my father was doing a residency in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 and my family was essentially from Canada. In fact, I was naturalised as a Canadian citizen when I turned 12 or 13. Later, having moved to Israel, I was again naturalised. So when my wife and I applied for postdoctoral positions at NIH, I had no idea that I (born in the US) and my wife and daughter (as dependents) had any claim on US citizenship. In fact, I had read that naturalisation to a foreign country and serving in a foreign military were both grounds for loss of US citizenship. So like my wife and daughter, I also applied for a visa. My wife received hers \u2013 but my daughter and I were denied visas, because of our status as potential US citizens. To condense a long and complex story, by providing a copy of a birth certificate, I was finally issued a temporary 1-year US passport (while my wife had her visa). It was our three-month-old daughter who caused us to make six trips in two weeks to the US consulate, combined with pleading, begging and cajoling, that finally led to authorisation to bring her along. After all the pressure and stress, when we finally arrived at customs and immigration in Washington, DC, with three completely different sets of paperwork \u2013 a temporary US passport, weird visa status for my family, a dog, and all of our worldly goods \u2013 I was extremely nervous about whether we would be allowed into the US. The immigration officer, however, did not blink. He merely looked up at me, stamped the temporary passport, and said &quot;Welcome home, Sir&quot;. Of course, that coined the phrase that later became the title of my novel &quot;Welcome Home, Sir&quot;, about an American/Israeli scientist in the US with post traumatic stress disorder, who struggles with issues of dual identity. Returning now, 10 years later, to the issue of brain drain, it seems as though the tide is turning. Or the drains are becoming clogged. The failure of the NIH budget to increase with the increasing number of US scientists has led to a situation where international postdocs no longer necessarily see the US as the place to be. Ten years ago, as a postdoc, I noted that Japanese and German postdocs in the US almost inevitably returned to their home countries. Today, even postdocs from countries whose science infrastructure is not as developed as that in the US (or Japan and Germany) are not so eager to stay in the US. Indian postdocs are opting for positions in India. Chinese postdocs are opting for opportunities in China&apos;s growing universities. And these two countries are only noted as examples of a wider trend. Perhaps, globally speaking, this may be good for a number of countries who have suffered from brain drain. However, it symbolises an increasingly frustrating situation for US science. If the pipes are not soon unclogged, even US-born scientists will soon be seeking careers in other countries. It&apos;s not hard to estimate the damage to the US that this will cause.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-26T11:25:45Z", "title": "Scientific brain drain \u2013 what happens when the pipes are clogged? | Steve Caplan", "sentences": ["According to Dr Dan Ben-David, Professor of Public Policy at Tel Aviv University, as a young country Israel realised the importance of education and academics, and between 1948 and the mid-70s, Israel managed to reach the same proportion of teaching and research staff per capita as the US."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2013/apr/26/scientific-brain-drain"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Syria"], "article": "     Israel has carried out a second air strike on Syria, hitting targets in and close to Damascus in what briefings by unnamed western intelligence sources reportedly claimed was an attempt to stop a shipment of advanced, Iranian-made missiles heading to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria&apos;s state news agency, Sana, reported explosions at the Jamraya military and scientific research centre near Damascus, saying: &quot;Initial reports point to these explosions being a result of Israeli missiles.&quot; The agency spoke of an unspecified number of casualties. While Israel made no comment, Lebanon&apos;s al-Mayadeen TV reported several apparent strikes, including one on a military position in a village west of Damascus, about six miles from the Lebanese border. Hezbollah&apos;s al-Manar TV said the Jamraya facility was not hit and that it was an army supply centre which had been targeted. The station quoted Syrian security officials as saying three sites, including military barracks, arms depots and air defence infrastructure, were targeted. Amateur video footage said to have been shot early on Sunday in the Damascus area showed fire lighting up the night sky. It is the second Israeli air strike on Syria in three days, both reportedly targeting what Israel believes are shipments of advanced weapons, including Iranian-made Fateh-110 missiles. &quot;In last night&apos;s attack, as in the previous one, what was attacked were stores of Fateh-110 missiles that were in transit from Iran to Hezbollah,&quot; Reuters quoted a &quot;western intelligence source&quot; as saying. There was no way to verify the claim. Israel has previously stated it will not allow the government of Syria&apos;s president, Bashar al-Assad, to assist the movement of sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah, to which it is closely allied. A similar air strike by Israel in January also targeted the Jamraya facility. The Fateh-110 missiles are believed to be significantly more sophisticated than any armaments currently possessed by Hezbollah, with accurate guidance systems and sufficient range to strike Tel Aviv from southern Lebanon. The earlier air strike was confirmed by sources in Israel, who said it was approved at a security cabinet meeting on Thursday night chaired by the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Borrowing the phrase used by Barack Obama to describe any confirmed use of chemical weapons, Israeli officials said they had hit &quot;game-changing&quot; weapons. Contradictory details emerged about the attack, with some sources saying a convoy had been struck and others a warehouse. It appears that the target was either anti-aircraft weapons or long-range ground-to-ground missiles. While Israel has stoked fears in recent weeks that the conflict in Syria could lead to the proliferation of chemical weapons, a senior Israeli defence ministry analyst said after the air strike that Syrian chemical weapons stocks remained controlled by the regime. &quot;Syria has large amounts of chemical weaponry and missiles. Everything there is under [Assad government] control,&quot; a defence ministry strategist, Amos Gilad, said in a speech. Israel has become increasing active in the debate over intervention. It was an Israeli military official who first claimed publicly that western intelligence agencies had evidence of chemical weapons used by the Assad regime. Netanyahu has repeatedly warned in recent weeks that Israel would be prepared to take military action if chemical weapons or other arms were to reach Hezbollah. The Lebanese group, which is allied with Iran, fought an inconclusive war with Israel in 2006 and has been accused of rearming with missiles.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-05T09:08:47Z", "title": "Israel carries out second air strike in Syria", "sentences": ["The Fateh-110 missiles are believed to be significantly more sophisticated than any armaments currently possessed by Hezbollah, with accurate guidance systems and sufficient range to strike Tel Aviv from southern Lebanon."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/israel-more-air-strikes-syria"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Hezbollah", "Bashar al-Assad"], "article": "     The Syrian government said that Israeli air strikes against military targets around Damascus amounted to a &quot;declaration of war&quot; and threatened retaliation, in the latest sign that the fighting is spilling across the Syrian border and risks sparking a wider regional conflict. Israel made no official comment on the strikes early on Sunday, which were the second in two days and the third and heaviest this year. Security sources said they were aimed at preventing the transfer of advanced Iranian-made missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon for possible use against Israel. After the attack, Israel deployed two batteries of Iron Dome anti-ballistic missiles, designed to intercept incoming enemy missiles, to the north of the country, and the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, delayed a trip to China to chair a meeting of his security cabinet. The Iranian army&apos;s ground forces commander, Brigadier General Ahmad-Reza Pourdastan, said Iran was ready to train the Syrian army if necessary, something Israeli and western officials say has been going on for some time, but observers said that the increasingly public and bellicose declarations from Syria&apos;s neighbours showed the conflict&apos;s potential for spreading. In a further development, UN human rights investigators have said they have &quot;strong suspicions&quot; that Syrian rebel forces might have used the nerve agent sarin. Carla del Ponte, one of the lead investigators, said the UN independent commission of inquiry on Syria has not yet seen evidence of government forces having used chemical weapons, which are banned under international law. But she told Swiss-Italian television: &quot;Our investigators have been in neighbouring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week, which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated. This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities.&quot; Del Ponte gave no details as to when or where sarin may have been used. The report followed claims last month that president Bashar al-Assad had used sarin gas in the conflict, but there has so far been no proof of its use. The Damascus regime&apos;s deputy foreign minister, Faisal al-Miqdad, told CNN the Israeli air strikes at the weekend represented &quot;a declaration of war&quot; and betokened an alliance between Islamist terrorists and Israel. He said Syria would retaliate in its own time and in its own way. Omran Zoabi, the information minister, said: &quot;Syria is a country that does not accept insults and it doesn&apos;t accept humiliation.&quot; Israeli military analysts said the missiles had been fired from outside Syrian airspace to avoid engaging Syria&apos;s reportedly formidable air defences. The Lebanese army said that Israeli planes had flown above Lebanon, an act that drew condemnation from the country&apos;s president, Michel Suleiman.     Syria locator.    The office of the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, also denounced the attack, declaring it illegal and a threat to &quot;security and stability in the region&quot;. Meanwhile, Nabil Elaraby, chief of the Arab League, appealed to the UN security council to &quot;move immediately to stop the Israeli aggressions on Syria&quot;. The air strikes lit up the night sky above west Damascus in the early hours of Sunday. Witnesses described a string of blasts that caused fiery clouds in the sky above Mount Qassioun, from where government artillery has been pounding rebel-held areas. &quot;The explosion was very, very strong,&quot; a Damascus-based activist, Maath al-Shami, told the Associated Press. Mohammed Saeed, another activist who lives in the Damascus suburb of Douma, said: &quot;The explosions were so strong that earth shook under us.&quot; He said the smell of the fire caused by the air raid near Qasioun was detectable kilometres away. Syrian state media reported that Israeli missiles had hit a military and scientific research centre in Jamraya near Damascus and caused casualties. Syrian officials had claimed that the first Israeli missile strikes in January had hit the same target, but that was denied at the time by US officials, who said the raids had been aimed at a missile shipment intended for Hezbollah. While avoiding direct confirmation that Israel had struck, Shaul Mofaz, a former defence minister, told Israel Radio: &quot;The policy of preventing leakage of significant weaponry and advanced systems to Hezbollah is right, otherwise we could encounter it here in Israel.&quot; A senior Israeli official was quoted by AP as saying the air strikes were aimed at destroying Fateh-110 missiles, a solid-fuelled Iranian weapon with a 200 mile range and precision guidance systems, far more effective than anything in Hezbollah&apos;s existing arsenal. Its Farsi name means &quot;conqueror&quot;. Michael Herzog, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said: &quot;The context according to reports I have seen is similar to January: a shipment of strategic weapons which would be a game-changer in a conflict with Hezbollah. There is great concern here about the spillover from Syria and particularly about strategic weapons \u2013 not just chemical weapons, but also missiles. &quot;Israel did act and will act whenever it feels its national security interests are threatened, be it on the joint border with Syria \u2013 which has been quiet until now but may not remain that way \u2013 or with the transfer of strategic weapons to Hezbollah.&quot; When Barack Obama visited Israel in March, Netanyahu asked for US help in stopping the spread of Syrian missiles and chemical weapons. &quot;These missiles are not just a problem for Israel,&quot; a senior Israeli official told the Guardian. Israeli officials also acknowledged that such air strikes could spark a new, highly destructive cross-border war with Hezbollah. Emile Hokayem, a regional analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said there were credible reports that, following the Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006, advanced Iranian missiles intended to help rearm the Lebanese Shia militia had been stockpiled in Syria under a joint custody arrangement. &quot;In 2006-07 Hezbollah was restocking obviously and the Syrians had an interest in a conflict-management role to keep some control,&quot; Hokayem said. &quot;This quality weaponry was prepositioned in Syria, under some kind of joint custody. We don&apos;t know the exact mechanisms, but it would clearly have been a very dangerous sovereignty for Assad to allow the Hezbollahis and Iran to do this without Syrian control.&quot; Amos Yadlin, a former chief of military intelligence who heads the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Army Radio that Syria risked serious damage to its already battered military capabilities if it responded to the latest air strikes. &quot;Assad knows that the rebels have made him the primary target, and if he tries to deflect the fire towards Israel, chances are that he will be attacked by both the rebels and Israel,&quot; Yadlin said. The air strikes were also a signal to Iran, Yadlin said, making it clear to Tehran that &quot;when at least some of the players define red lines, and they are crossed, they take it seriously&quot;. Netanyahu has urged the US and other nations to set a &quot;red line&quot; for Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, beyond which it could face military strikes on facilities Israel says are developing the components of a nuclear weapon.

Hawking, 71, the world-renowned theoretical physicist and former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, had accepted an invitation to headline the fifth annual president&apos;s conference, Facing Tomorrow, in June, which features major international personalities, attracts thousands of participants and this year will celebrate Peres&apos;s 90th birthday. Hawking is in very poor health, but last week he wrote a brief letter to the Israeli president to say he had changed his mind. He has not announced his decision publicly, but a statement published by the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine with Hawking&apos;s approval described it as &quot;his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there&quot;. Hawking&apos;s decision marks another victory in the campaign for boycott, divestment and sanctions targeting Israeli academic institutions. In April the Teachers&apos; Union of Ireland became the first lecturers&apos; association in Europe to call for an academic boycott of Israel, and in the United States members of the Association for Asian American Studies voted to support a boycott, the first national academic group to do so. In the four weeks since Hawking&apos;s participation in the Jerusalem event was announced, he has been bombarded with messages from Britain and abroad as part of an intense campaign by boycott supporters trying to persuade him to change his mind. In the end, Hawking told friends, he decided to follow the advice of Palestinian colleagues who unanimously agreed that he should not attend. Hawking&apos;s decision met with abusive responses on Facebook, with many commentators focusing on his physical condition, and some accusing him of antisemitism. By participating in the boycott, Hawking joins a small but growing list of British personalities who have turned down invitations to visit Israel, including Elvis Costello, Roger Waters, Brian Eno, Annie Lennox and Mike Leigh. However, many artists, writers and academics have defied and even denounced the boycott, calling it ineffective and selective. Ian McEwan, who was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 2011, responded to critics by saying: &quot;If I only went to countries that I approve of, I probably would never get out of bed \u2026 It&apos;s not great if everyone stops talking.&quot; Noam Chomsky, a prominent supporter of the Palestinian cause, has said that he supports the &quot;boycott and divestment of firms that are carrying out operations in the occupied territories&quot; but that a general boycott of Israel is &quot;a gift to Israeli hardliners and their American supporters&quot;. Hawking has visited Israel four times in the past. Most recently, in 2006, he delivered public lectures at Israeli and Palestinian universities as the guest of the British embassy in Tel Aviv. At the time, he said he was &quot;looking forward to coming out to Israel and the Palestinian territories and excited about meeting both Israeli and Palestinian scientists&quot;. Since then, his attitude to Israel appears to have hardened. In 2009, Hawking denounced Israel&apos;s three-week attack on Gaza, telling Riz Khan on Al-Jazeera that Israel&apos;s response to rocket fire from Gaza was &quot;plain out of proportion \u2026 The situation is like that of South Africa before 1990 and cannot continue.&quot; Israel Maimon, chairman of the presidential conference said: &quot;This decision is outrageous and wrong. &quot;The use of an academic boycott against Israel is outrageous and improper, particularly for those to whom the spirit of liberty is the basis of the human and academic mission. Israel is a democracy in which everyone can express their opinion, whatever it may be. A boycott decision is incompatible with open democratic discourse.&quot; In 2011, the Israeli parliament passed a law making a boycott call by an individual or organisation a civil offence which can result in compensation liable to be paid regardless of actual damage caused. It defined a boycott as &quot;deliberately avoiding economic, cultural or academic ties with another person or another factor only because of his ties with the State of Israel, one of its institutions or an area under its control, in such a way that may cause economic, cultural or academic damage&quot;. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2013.

It didn&apos;t end well. Almost 6,000 years later, in 1909, a group of young Jews decided to recreate that original garden in Ottoman Palestine, and on the southern tip of the Lake of Galilee set up a kibbutz (or &quot;gathering&quot;) which they hopefully named Kvutzat Degania (&quot;wheat of God&quot;). One of the founders explained that their ideal was not to establish a settlement modelled on &quot;the old way, with Jews on top and Arabs working for them&quot;, but one in which there &quot;wouldn&apos;t be employers and employed at all&quot;: there would be a\u00a0self-sufficient community of peers. Already in the 14th century, John Ball had famously summed up this ideal in\u00a0a question: &quot;When Adam delved and\u00a0Eve span, who was then the gentleman?&quot; The kibbutz meant to respond with a state of blissful equality. Amos Klausner was born in 1939 in Jerusalem and at the age of 15, a few years after the suicide of his mother left him bereft, he joined a kibbutz in central Israel and changed his name to Oz, meaning &quot;strength&quot; in Hebrew. He (and later his wife and children) lived in the kibbutz until 1986, when the family moved out because the climate of the region worsened the son&apos;s asthma. Asked why he had chosen to live on a kibbutz, Oz answered that life in a city like Tel Aviv was not &quot;radical&quot; enough for him. The kibbutz, instead, seemed to allow for the realisation of his utopian dreams, to live among what\u00a0he calls in Between Friends &quot;people with patience and doubts and\u00a0compassion&quot;. But patience and doubts and compassion are not enough to sustain\u00a0utopia: at its heart is always an\u00a0ultimate sense of disappointment. Our long history of imagined happy societies is one of heroic failures, and Oz&apos;s kibbutz proved to be something less than paradise. Jealousy, bigotry, pride, lust, envy, gossip and several other common frailties beset the settlement; above all, loneliness, made\u00a0worse by the constant presence of others who relentlessly watch and judge. Between Friends is the lucid and heartbreaking chronicle of one such well-intentioned and hard-working community of lonely souls. In spite of the first person plural that opens the first chapter, the book is not a memoir, much less documentary history. It can be read as a novel made up of eight stories, or as a skein of stories woven into a novel, in which characters cross over from strand to strand and patches are clarified or continued in other patches, lending the whole narrative a growing sense of\u00a0uneasy familiarity. Beginning with a misanthropic middle-aged gardener&apos;s passion for conveying bad news, which he avidly culls from newspapers and the radio, and ending with a dying old man&apos;s attempt to teach his fellow kibbutzim Esperanto, stretching from the ills of the world to the hopes of the world, Between Friends is a miniature human\u00a0comedy. It explores the always\u00a0uncertain relationships between men\u00a0and women, parents and\u00a0children, friends and enemies, in\u00a0a\u00a0clear, clipped language perfectly suited to the laconic tone of the narrative and impeccably rendered into English by Sondra Silverston. A single discreet detail unfolds centuries of political conflict, as when\u00a0a\u00a0troubled young man wanders through the ruins of the Arab village destroyed by the settlers as retaliation for an attack; or raises vast ethical questions concerning subservience and freedom, as when a &quot;tall, thin, sad and bespectacled&quot; 16-year old thinks of\u00a0freeing a chicken from the kibbutz coop but realises that if he does, it will\u00a0be killed by jackals in the night. The Esperanto teacher declares that\u00a0&quot;imprecise words poison relations between people everywhere, and that&apos;s why clear, accurate words can heal those relationships, but only if\u00a0they are the right words spoken in\u00a0a\u00a0language that all people can understand&quot;. One of the students observes that Cain and Abel &quot;probably spoke the same language too&quot;; another says nothing but thinks that &quot;the sorrow in the world was born long\u00a0before words&quot;. Underlying Between Friends is a notion that Oz has upheld for many years: that compromise, not conflict, is\u00a0the only possible solution to the Middle East conundrum, an agreement that would require each side accepting the other side&apos;s identity and right to exist. The skirmishes and struggles within the kibbutz, the ancient sorrows and unfulfilled expectations, the difficulties of living &quot;between friends&quot;\u00a0are, according to Oz, not\u00a0unlike the\u00a0difficulties of living &quot;between enemies&quot;,\u00a0today and always, since the label imposed on any group of human beings never suffices to recognise them fully as individuals. As\u00a0Between Friends makes clear, the\u00a0impossibility of utopia is less a\u00a0demonstration of the failure of conviviality than an ongoing proof of our determination to keep on trying. \u2022 Alberto Manguel&apos;s A Reader on Reading is published by Yale.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-08T14:24:36Z", "title": "Between Friends by Amos Oz \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Asked why he had chosen to live on a kibbutz, Oz answered that life in a city like Tel Aviv was not &quot;radical&quot; enough for him."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/08/between-friends-amos-oz-review"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Stephen Hawking", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Stephen Hawking, perhaps the greatest mind of our era, has backed a boycott in protest over the policy of the present Israeli government towards the Palestinians.

The efforts of those who want Israel to be shunned \u2013 whether in culture, sport, academia or politics \u2013 garner plenty of interest, but never so much as when a celebrity gets on board. When Hebrew-speaking thespians were invited to the Globe theatre, a chorus including Emma Thompson publicly professed indignation. The debate about Israel hosting next month&apos;s European under-21 football championship went far beyond the blogs following the intervention of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9. Conversely, when Rihanna or Justin Bieber perform in Tel Aviv, they suddenly attract the unlikeliest of fans. Indeed, those against the boycott jumped for joy when it briefly \u2013 and incorrectly \u2013 seemed that Hawking had cancelled for health, rather than political, reasons. It&apos;s natural, if you support a cause strongly, to crow when a prominent individual who is listened to far more than the average openly backs your cause. For some \u2013 Roger Waters comes to mind \u2013 preoccupation with the Israeli-Palestinian situation goes further than a signature, but for many, I&apos;d hazard, wading in one way or the other comes not after years of study of the Middle East. The famous have as much right as anyone to talk politics and if a prominent individual wishes to back a boycott, or rage against it, he is free to do so. The problem is the activists who seize on them as poster children. It&apos;s disingenuous, investing one signature with the weight of an entire political approach, and implying that because of a person&apos;s notoriety, their pronouncements are gospel instead of what they are \u2013 the views of someone no more or less informed. Many causes need glitter to get a hearing. The Rohingya Muslims, for example: their plight rarely makes the front page. George Clooney brought Darfur to the world&apos;s attention. You can say plenty about Gaza, but you cannot claim it is ignored by the mainstream media. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is extraordinarily complex. It requires activists with a vested interest to focus on the facts, to aim for more than point-scoring, and consider the real questions \u2013 how to end the cycle of violence, for one, and how to educate people on both sides as to why two states is the answer \u2013 not which celebrity agrees with them. What the Middle East desperately needs is dialogue, which is why I believe a boycott cannot offer a constructive approach. The discussion could well benefit from meaningful interventions from intellectuals like Hawking, but these must go beyond headline-grabbing. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2013-05-09T09:46:59Z", "title": "Stephen Hawking's Israel boycott: when politics doesn't need poster children | Jennifer Lipman", "sentences": ["Conversely, when Rihanna or Justin Bieber perform in Tel Aviv, they suddenly attract the unlikeliest of fans."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/09/stephen-hawking-israel-boycott"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has encountered severe turbulence after it emerged that he ordered a double bed to be installed on a plane that carried him and his deeply unpopular wife, Sara, to Baroness Thatcher&apos;s funeral in London last month \u2013 at a cost of $127,000 (\u00a383,000). The revelation comes amid growing resentment over an austerity budget proposed by the finance minister Yair Lapid, a former TV personality who won popular support in January&apos;s election by promising to champion Israel&apos;s financially squeezed middle class. Up to 15,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities on Saturday night in an echo of the massive social justice protests that swept the country two years ago. Following an outcry over the cost of installing a &quot;rest chamber&quot; on the chartered El Al flight, Netanyahu&apos;s office said that henceforth no sleeping cabins would be provided on short-haul flights to Europe. Initially, officials defended the move \u2013 disclosed by Israel&apos;s Channel 10 on Friday evening \u2013 in a statement that was immediately mocked by commentators for its detailed account of Netanyahu&apos;s schedule. The statement said: &quot;The prime minister took off for London on the night after Independence Day, in the course of which he attended a reception for outstanding soldiers at the presidential residence, the World Bible Quiz, a reception for diplomatic personnel in Israel and the Israel prize ceremony. The flight was booked for midnight after a day full of events, and afterwards the prime minister was to represent the state of Israel at a number of official international events, including meetings with the prime ministers of Canada and Britain. It is acceptable for the prime minister of Israel to be able to rest at night between two packed days as those.&quot; El Al, Israel&apos;s national airline, was paid $427,000 for the charter flight, including the cost of the chamber. A smaller plane, without sleeping quarters, would have cost $300,000, according to Israeli media reports. Channel 10 pointed out that the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, who will be 90 next month, spent an 11-hour flight to South Korea seated in business class. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel&apos;s biggest-selling newspaper, Sima Kadmon said: &quot;We thought that nothing could surprise us anymore when it came to the Netanyahus&apos; personal behaviour. Well, we thought wrong. It turns out that King Bibi and Queen Sara are entitled to do everything \u2026 The double bed that was installed on the plane cost the Israeli public, which is buckling under the weight of the austerity measures, half a million shekels. Is there no shame?&quot; The disclosure of Netanyahu&apos;s in-flight sleeping arrangements follows the revelation earlier this year of a prime ministerial budget of $2,800 for ice-cream. A contract with a Jerusalem ice-cream parlour was swiftly cancelled. Meanwhile, the Israeli public is facing a 1.5% rise in income tax, a 1% increase in VAT and a reduction in child allowances as part of an austerity package, which critics says disproportionately penalises the middle class. Anger at demonstrations on Saturday focused on Lapid, whose party Yesh Atid (There is a Future) came second in January&apos;s election and is now a key partner in Netanyahu&apos;s coalition government. Lapid had pitched his campaign at middle-class voters who were the mainstay of 2011&apos;s social justice movement. Daphni Leef, one of the protest leaders, called on Lapid to &quot;take from the tycoons, not the people \u2026 from those who have and not from those who don&apos;t&quot;. Lior Tzur, 31, told the Jerusalem Post: &quot;Lapid sold us all an illusion that he&apos;ll change things and help the middle class, when really he&apos;s just going to continue the same policies of money and power that existed before.&quot; A poll published in the pro-government Israel Hayom tabloid last week found that more than 50% of respondents said their confidence in Lapid had fallen since the election.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-12T11:18:48Z", "title": "Netanyahu flies into turbulence over $127,000 bed on plane", "sentences": ["Up to 15,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities on Saturday night in an echo of the massive social justice protests that swept the country two years ago."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/12/netanyahu-turbulence-127000-bed-plane"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The profligacy of Binyamin Netanyahu has come under fire for the second time within a few days after it was disclosed that the amount of public money spent by Israel&apos;s first couple on household expenses rocketed by 80% in three years. New figures show the prime minister and his wife, Sara, spent 5.43m shekels (\u00a3975,000) in their official and private residences in 2012, compared with 3.02m shekels in 2009. The disclosure, following a request from the Movement for Freedom of Information, comes after officials ordered a &quot;rest chamber&quot; containing a double bed to be built inside the chartered plane which carried the Netanyahus to London last month for Lady Thatcher&apos;s funeral. The sleeping arrangements for the five-hour flight added \u00a383,000 to the charter costs. The Netanyahus&apos; household spending in 2012 included \u00a386,000 of taxpayers&apos; money for food and hospitality, \u00a3215,000 for cleaning and maintenance, \u00a320,000 on furniture and household utensils, and \u00a312,000 for &quot;representation expenses&quot; such as clothes, hairdressing and makeup. Most of the money was spent on the prime minister&apos;s official residence in Jerusalem, but around \u00a357,000 was spent on the Netanyahus&apos; private villa in the upmarket seaside resort of Caesarea. According to a statement from the Netanyahu&apos;s office, the figures covered &quot;expenses for official events held in the prime minister&apos;s home and working expenses for the many meetings held there&quot;. The prime minister&apos;s aides were forced to cancel a contract with a Jerusalem ice cream parlour this year after the revelation of an official budget of \u00a31,750 of public money for Netanyahu&apos;s favourite dessert caused outcry. The latest figures were made public as the Israeli cabinet approved a two-year austerity budget which is set to raise taxes and cut public spending in order to close a 2012 deficit of \u00a37bn. The budget includes a 1.5% rise in personal taxation, a 1% rise in VAT and cuts in child allowances. Demonstrations against the budget measures were held in Tel Aviv and other cities at the weekend. Anger has focused on the finance minister, Yair Lapid, a former television personality whose party shot to second place in January&apos;s election after a campaign based on promises to protect Israel&apos;s financially squeezed middle class. According to a report in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel&apos;s biggest-selling newspaper, Netanyahu was accompanied by 31 aides on last week&apos;s official trip to China, including two whose role was to attend to the needs of Sara Netanyahu and the couple&apos;s two grown-up sons. The former prime minister Ehud Olmert was accompanied by 18 aides on a trip to China in 2007, the prime minister&apos;s office said. The same paper carried an article by the commentator Shimon Shiffer, who said: &quot;A week ago I asked one of the new ministers what surprised him most about the cabinet meetings. What surprised me, replied the minister, was that Netanyahu comes to every meeting and discussion heavily made-up. When I looked into the matter, said the minister, I learned that a pair of hairdressers and makeup artists apply themselves every morning to the prime minister and his wife&apos;s faces and hair.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-05-14T09:48:00Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu's spending under fire again as home expenses near \u00a31m", "sentences": ["Demonstrations against the budget measures were held in Tel Aviv and other cities at the weekend."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/binyamin-netanyahu-spending-expenses-israel"}, {"tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Activate"], "article": "Can you tell us about your role as head of Google campus? As the head of campus, my focus is on helping startups grow by providing them with the best environment, education and mentorship support and access to a vibrant startup community at the campus. I rely on a small but great team of Googlers (Google employees) to make it happen, and we work closely with our partners. Most recently, I&apos;m proud of the launch of CampusEDU, an educational programme to help startups access the skills they need, when they need them. CampusEDU includes mentoring events, inspirational speakers and classes \u2013 delivered in collaboration with Googlers, top universities, startups and corporate partners. Have any elements surprised you about Google campus in London? Campus just celebrated its first anniversary, and looking back, we had a spectacular year. In just 365 days, we hosted more than 850 events at the campus, attracting more than 60,000 people for events alone. The campus serves as home to more than 100 startups a day, and in retrospect, I didn&apos;t expect to make such a big impact in such a short period of time. What have been the challenges along the way and how have you solved them? Campus is a big experiment in physical space for Google \u2013 it was the first of its kind in the world and the only one, until Google announced the launch of campus Tel Aviv a few months ago. One of the big challenges was the sheer amount of work and the fear of burning out. In line with the campus spirit, I found a scrappy solution \u2013 I&apos;ve recruited 10 Googlers on 20% projects (as Google employees are allowed to spend 20% of their time on pet projects to keep them creative and energised) at the campus to help run initiatives based on their expertise. For example, we recently published the first-year anniversary report, which was a survey of 1,850 members of campus. Writing a survey is a bit of an art, so rather than me trying to make it work, Marina and Ollie from the Google research team did an excellent job in creating it, delivering it and analysing the data. How does the London tech startup scene compare to other cities? Having lived in Israel, New York and San Francisco, I have a pretty good idea of what a successful startup ecosystem looks like. London has all the elements to succeed as a startup hub. First, we have access to talent, with some of the top universities in the world based here, in addition to global talent that flocks to the city as a metropolis. Second, we have access to capital \u2013 there&apos;s a huge concentration of wealth in London, and more capital is flowing into startups. Finally, we have ideas. While Europe was previously seen as the copycat centre for startups, more and more I&apos;m seeing UK based startups who are disrupting their markets globally. London is a bit behind some of the leading startup hubs when it comes to density of network, but the momentum is playing in our favour, and it&apos;s incredible to see how quickly it is improving. How will London&apos;s technology landscape change in the next five years? Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, said that &quot;prediction is very difficult, especially about the future&quot;. Five years in tech is a long time, but I believe London&apos;s tech landscape will be more focused and specialised than it is today. We may see clear areas of concentration for startups in advertising, fashion, media and fintech, fuelled by acquisitions, and who knows, maybe even initial public offerings (IPOs). What three factors contribute to the success of a startup? A strong team, with complementary skills and a strong culture. Building a great product in a lean way, and finding product-market fit, by listening to customers feedback and finding the right solution for the market the startup is going after. Often, getting access to the right mentorship can also contribute to founders avoiding common pitfalls along the way. Finally, what&apos;s your advice for aspiring entrepreneurs? This is a very general question, but one thing that will always be true is &quot;never stop learning&quot;. Creating a startup and launching a product is a constant cycle of build, measure and learn. Make sure you continue to learn by yourself and from others. Serendipity will surely follow, one way or another.

Israeli diplomats will continue to work both privately and publicly to prevent the transfer until the shipment sails, but officials attempted to lower the diplomatic temperature, insisting Israel had no intention of fighting Russia on the issue. Israel has read Moscow&apos;s insistence on pursuing its deal to supply Damascus with the powerful missile systems as part of a &quot;cold war&quot; power struggle between the US and Russia playing out in the theatre of the Syrian civil war in which it wants no part. &quot;We are unhappy with the prospect of these very serious weapons arriving in Syria but we cannot stop Russia delivering them to the Middle East. We would not strike a Russian target \u2013 our egos are big but they&apos;re not that big,&quot; one senior Israeli diplomat told the Guardian on condition of anonymity. The Israeli military will not hesitate, however, to take any steps necessary to prevent the transfer of this sophisticated Russian anti-aircraft technology to Hezbollah militants or other hostile groups. &quot;I don&apos;t know how upset the Russians would be if, at some point between payment and the installation of this technology in Damascus by Russian experts, something was done to damage the weaponry. As long as no Russians were hurt and they got paid, I don&apos;t think they would care,&quot; the diplomat added. Despite the grim warning from the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya&apos;alon, that Israel &quot;would know what to do&quot; should the delivery of SA300s go ahead, further Israeli military intervention in Syria should not be interpreted as a harbinger of regional war. The current Israeli military intelligence is that neither Hezbollah nor the Syrian regime is prepared to take on Israel in open conflict. Any reciprocal attacks to future Israeli strikes are likely to be carried out on Israeli targets abroad or, possibly, in further cross-border fire in the Golan. Israel&apos;s major concern is not that the Assad regime will use its sophisticated Russian- and Iranian-supplied weaponry against Israel \u2013 a move described by Israeli officials as &quot;suicide&quot; \u2013 but where the arms will end up if and when the regime falls. Yuval Steinitz, Israel&apos;s minister of strategic affairs and intelligence, warned journalists in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Russia&apos;s SA300s could be fed through Damascus back to Assad&apos;s allies in Iran, &quot;and by these means bypass the arms embargo on Iran&quot;. &quot;We don&apos;t want to get involved in the [Syrian] civil war but we will defend ourselves as we always did,&quot; Steinitz warned. The dramatic events of the past week, which has seen Europe prepare to arm Syrian rebels and Russia continue to prop up the regime, may actually have served Israeli interests by prolonging the civil war and dragging out the Syrian conflict until a legitimate, western-friendly leadership emerges from the opposition. &quot;Israel, along with most global players outside of Iran, is quite content to see this civil war continue for a little while longer because there is no palatable alternative that is ready,&quot; an Israeli official revealed.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-29T13:15:55Z", "title": "Israel in Moscow talks to halt supply of missiles to Syrian regime", "sentences": ["Top-level Israeli intelligence figures flew into Moscow on Tuesday night in a last-ditch attempt to talk the Kremlin out of supplying sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime, which once installed in Syria would have the range and power to target civilian and military aircraft over Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/29/israel-moscow-talks-halt-missiles-syria"}, {"tags": ["Alicia Keys", "Roger Waters", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Alice Walker", "Books", "Culture", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Roger Waters and Alice Walker have penned open letters asking Alicia Keys to call off a forthcoming concert in Tel Aviv.

An Occupy-style movement has taken off in Istanbul. The ostensible issue of conflict is modest. Protesters started gathering in the park on 27 May, to oppose its demolition as part of a redevelopment plan. But this is more than an environmental protest. It has become a lightning conductor for all the grievances accumulated against the government. Police have waited until the early hours of each morning to attack, just as police in the US did when dealing with Occupy protesters. They set fire to the tents in which protesters were sleeping and showered them with pepper spray and teargas. A student had to undergo surgery after injuries to his genitals. The occupiers adapted and started to wear homemade gas masks. More importantly, they called for solidarity. In response to yesterday&apos;s assault, thousands of protesters turned up, including opposition politicians. But this morning&apos;s attack allowed no defence or escape. The park, and the area around it, is still closed, and still under clouds of gas. In April, a Justice and Development party (AKP) leader warned that the liberals who had supported them in the last decade would no longer do so. This was as good a sign as any that the repression would increase, as the neoliberal Islamist party forced through its modernisation agenda. The AKP represents a peculiar type of conservative populism. Its bedrock, enriched immensely in the last decade, is the conservative Muslim bourgeoisie that first emerged as a result of Turgut \u00d6zal&apos;s economic policies in the 1980s. But, while denying it is a religious party, it has used the politics of piety to gain a popular base and to strengthen the urban rightwing. It has spent more than a decade in government building up its authority. The privatisation process has led to accelerated inequality, accompanied by repression. But it has also attracted floods of international investment, leading to growth rates of close to 5% a year. This has enabled the regime to pay off the last of its IMF loans, so that it was even in a position to offer the IMF $5bn to help with the Eurozone crisis in 2012. In the meantime, the AKP has gradually consolidated its support within the state apparatus and media, and no longer needs its liberal backers. The Turkish military leadership has been compelled to accept the Islamists, having suffered a significant loss of power relative to other branches of the state such as the police and judiciary. While the erosion of the military&apos;s power should be a gain for democracy, journalists have also ended up in jail on charges of plotting coup d&apos;etats. Of course, there is a history of coup plotting. And the government charged 86 people with plotting to bring down the government in 2008, as part of its investigation into the Turkish &quot;deep state&quot;. But it has been able to use this fear to conflate all opposition with anti-democratic instigation, and crush it ruthlessly. During this time, its vote has risen from 34.28% to 49.90%. It has also demonstrated confidence in the way it has attempted to deal with the Kurdish question, and in its regional strategy. The government embarked on significant new negotiations with the Kurdish Workers party (PKK) in 2009, partly because it wants to forge a lucrative relationship with the Kurdish regional government in Iraq. Under the AKP, Turkey has been increasing its relative autonomy from traditional supporters in the White House and Tel Aviv, forging close relations with Iran, Hezbollah and even \u2013 until recently \u2013 President Assad of Syria. This has been interpreted, hysterically, as &quot;neo-Ottomanism&quot;. It is simply an assertion of Turkey&apos;s new power. Thus strengthened, the government is on the offensive. It has never needed the left or the labour movement, which it has repressed. It no longer needs the liberals, as its attacks on women&apos;s reproductive rights, and its imposition of alcohol-free zones, show. This is the context in which a struggle over a small park in a congested city centre has become an emergency for the regime, and the basis for a potential Turkish spring.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T16:34:44Z", "title": "Istanbul park protests sow the seeds of a Turkish spring | Richard Seymour", "sentences": ["Under the AKP, Turkey has been increasing its relative autonomy from traditional supporters in the White House and Tel Aviv, forging close relations with Iran, Hezbollah and even \u2013 until recently \u2013 President Assad of Syria."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/31/istanbul-park-protests-turkish-spring"}, {"tags": ["England Under-21s", "Stuart Pearce", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Stuart Pearce has praised the growing maturity of his England Under-21 squad before the start of the European Championship finals in Israel this week, with the manager revealing he took the unprecedented step of allowing three of his players to deliver the team talk before their final preparation game. Pearce spoke about his novel pre-match approach after the England squad arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Their opening group fixture is against Italy on Wednesday night when they will hope to continue the form that has seen them string together nine successive wins without conceding a goal. The last of those victories came against Austria in March, when Pearce encouraged Tottenham&apos;s Adam Smith, Bolton Wanderers&apos;s Marvin Sordell and Liverpool&apos;s Jordan Henderson to brief the rest of the squad before a 4-0 triumph in bitterly cold conditions, far removed from the sweltering heat they will experience in Israel. The way the trio responded to their task convinced Pearce that, while the squad are not blessed with the same talent as the class of 2011, when England were able to call on Kyle Walker, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Daniel Sturridge and Tom Cleverley, there is no shortage of character and leadership within the ranks. &quot;Before we left the hotel, I sat back and let the players do the team talk,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;They told us exactly what needed to be done in certain positions. We had one from each unit of the team \u2013 Smith, Henderson and Sordell \u2013 and they probably delivered exactly how I would have done it. It was done in a slightly different manner and with fewer swear words. But in the main, they delivered. &quot;As a group, if I was a club manager working with them, it would be a case of empowering them and giving them real responsibility. Whoever I would have asked to give the talk, they would have delivered. It was just basically asking them how we play and what do we want from them. &quot;I&apos;ve never done it before. I just felt they were ready for it. A couple of nights earlier, we had someone from the military come in and speak. I just felt as a group and individuals, they were just about ready for it.

Bernstein said that Pearce&apos;s position will be reviewed after the tournament in Israel and in consultation with Greg Dyke, who will take over as the FA chairman at the start of July. Pearce&apos;s contract expires at the end of this month and there has been no indication that the 51-year-old will be offered a new deal, despite his impressive record as Under-21 manager. Since his appointment in 2007, Pearce has led England to an unprecedented four successive European Championship finals, and he has also presided over an excellent recent run of results that has seen the Under-21 side win their past nine matches without conceding a goal. Yet his approach to the job has not always tallied with Roy Hodgson&apos;s vision for the Under-21 side, in particular when it comes to which players should be picked. While Pearce believes he should have the strongest possible squad at his disposal in the European Championship finals, Hodgson felt it was more beneficial for players such as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to be involved in the friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil. Hodgson will be among those whose opinion will be sought when Bernstein and Dyke, and the other members of the Club England board, discuss Pearce&apos;s future this month. &quot;Our position with Stuart will be left open,&quot; said Bernstein, who was speaking in Brazil, where Oxlade-Chamberlain scored England&apos;s first goal in the 2-2 draw at the Maracan\u00e3. &quot;We will review it with him at the end of the Under-21s. It is right on the cusp of when I go and it is probably right that any discussions should include my successor. I think I have two weeks left by then and I wouldn&apos;t want to tie anyone&apos;s hands. Any major decision at that stage, it would only be right that my successor is involved.&quot; Pearce is concentrating on the job in hand, starting with Wednesday&apos;sopening group game against Italy in Tel Aviv, where the manager is confident that he will be able to call on the services of Wilfried Zaha, despite the Manchester United forward sitting out the first training session. Zaha, who has been struggling with a long-standing ankle problem, broke off from the main group after the warmup on Monday morning and went through some gentle drills with Derek Wright, the Newcastle United physiotherapist, before watching from the sidelines. With Tom Ince suspended for the match, along with Danny Rose, and England limited in terms of their attacking options, it would be a major blow if Zaha was also ruled out. The 20-year-old, who joined up with the England squad late because of his involvement with Crystal Palace in the Championship play-off final, cut a forlorn figure as he looked on while the rest of the squad were put through their paces at their training ground in Netanya. Pearce remains hopeful that Zaha will be cleared to play against Italy. &quot;He shouldn&apos;t be a doubt,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s obviously played a really full season with the play-off final last Monday. The plan was to do the warmup and then work with the physios. We&apos;ll have another look at him and see where he is with regards to his fitness. But we shouldn&apos;t have a problem. &quot;He&apos;s on top form as you&apos;d expect after his contribution to the whole season for Palace and getting a move to Manchester United, and on top of that winning the play-offs. He&apos;s been outstanding and he&apos;s left the club back in the Premier League so he&apos;ll be a cult hero with Palace for what he&apos;s achieved for them.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-03T11:01:43Z", "title": "Stuart Pearce focuses on England opener despite doubts over future", "sentences": ["Any major decision at that stage, it would only be right that my successor is involved.&quot; Pearce is concentrating on the job in hand, starting with Wednesday&apos;sopening group game against Italy in Tel Aviv, where the manager is confident that he will be able to call on the services of Wilfried Zaha, despite the Manchester United forward sitting out the first training session."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/wilfried-zaha-england-under-21s"}, {"tags": ["MLS", "Vancouver Whitecaps", "Philadelphia Union", "Toronto FC", "Colorado Rapids", "US sports", "New York Red Bulls", "FC Dallas", "LA Galaxy", "San Jose Earthquakes", "Football", "Sport", "New England Revolution", "USA", "Real Salt Lake"], "article": "New England Revolution nightmare for LA Galaxy A historic win for the New England Revolution: a team making a statement. Alarm bells for LA Galaxy: tied for the MLS Cup champions&apos; worst ever defeat.  Results are important in football, in case you didn&apos;t know. Despite missed chances and good efforts and countless what-ifs, it&apos;s still three points for a win, one for draw, none for a loss. Yet while Sunday&apos;s five goal rout might make the Revs seem like champions and the Galaxy seem, well, not like the Galaxy, what ultimately matters are the underlying team fundamentals. The process. A good, proven process is the closest thing to a guarantee a team will finish high up the table.  That&apos;s why observers should resist the temptation of making wild extrapolations from the Revolution&apos;s stunning 5-0 defeat of the Galaxy at Gillette stadium. It&apos;s also why the steadily-improving Revs head coach Jay Heaps didn&apos;t walk away from sidelines beating his chest:  &quot;We have five wins now. It&apos;s important to use this as a learning experience. Like I said, there&apos;s really good stuff we did, but there&apos;s things we have to get better at and we can&apos;t let a game get so wide open when we have a two-goal lead.&quot;  The statistics reveal a little of what Heaps is talking about. Despite the lopsided scoreline, the Revs were defeated on almost every metric save for goals, including taking 9 shots to LA&apos;s 13. Four of the Galaxy&apos;s attempts came within ten minutes of Lee Nguyen&apos;s second goal in the 71st minute, which underlines Heaps&apos; concern. Thankfully for the Revolution, three of those attempts came from Juninho, a key player who has yet to score in 13 starts this season.  For LA, it was a very bad afternoon with some major caveats. First, the loss of Omar Gonzalez and Robbie Keane to international duty took both defensive solidity and attacking threat out of the side. Second, the inexperience of Tommy Meyer in centreback along with another bad outing for the rookie Greg Cochrane made the LA defense look as static as a row of training pylons as the Revs midfield weaved past them. Third, the goals mostly came after Nguyen&apos;s controversial goal, from a quickly taken Revs free-kick which LA initially thought was their throw-in until referee Fotis Bazakos overruled his assistant. Inexperience combined with a sense of injustice may have killed LA&apos;s concentration late in the game (two of the goals came in stoppage time). Still, the Galaxy did all the right things. They had more possession, they took more chances, they had more shots on goal. They did this against a Revolution side which has the lowest goals against rate in the league, with only nine conceded. Meanwhile, despite the failure to take their chances on Sunday, Bruce Arena&apos;s team is still on 21 goals scored, two away from the league high. The process is still good.  As for the Revolution there are signs of a midfield engine really starting to hum. Agudelo, Fagundez, and Sene combined brilliantly in the latter stages of the second half. If the Revs can figure out a way to combine their already impressive defence with a front line that found its groove against the MLS Cup champs, the Revolution may have already begun. RW Vancouver Whitecaps&apos; Jordan Harvey has a week of two feet When a team is in free fall, or perceived to be in free fall, it&apos;s hard to stop the sense of failure being somehow pre-determined \u2014 with evidence for it everywhere. Elsewhere today Richard talks about the late goals Toronto concede - partly it seems, because the team itself half expects them and behaves accordingly. In LA this weekend Chivas USA played their first match without Chelis (and their first back four of the season), only to see one of their number score an own goal that was so neatly and unfussily taken it looked like a training ground move. On Wednesday night Jordan Harvey, who has found himself on the fringes of a Vancouver Whitecaps team that has struggled for wins of late, had a chance to win Vancouver their first ever Voyageurs Cup and a place in next season&apos;s Champions League as Canada&apos;s representative. It would have given some much needed respite to an under-pressure Rennie and confirmed that his project, currently overshadowed by the success of Cascadia rivals Portland Timbers and fellow Canadians (and cup final opponents) Montreal Impact. The ball fell to Harvey on his less favored right foot and he scuffed his shot. Montreal won the cup on a late away goal. Rennie was duly on the defensive for the next day&apos;s press briefing and coming in to Saturday&apos;s game at New York. His team duly showed little ambition or belief in a first half where they were overrun by a New York team on their best unbeaten run in ten years, with both sides playing as if a Red Bulls goal was inevitable. And when the Red Bulls went 1-0 up on a Vancouver own goal early in the second, the suspension and injury-ravaged Whitecaps looked to be headed to another defeat, while the Red Bulls looked to have made their own luck yet again on this unlikely run. Then, seemingly from nowhere, a loose header from New York&apos;s Eric Alexander dropped to Harvey, this time on his left foot. His first time volley flew past Robles, and suddenly the game changed.       Vancouver started to play with belief. New York lost their sense of entitlement and direction; Miller ghosted in to head what turned out to be the winner; Olave was sent off for New York and by the time the game finished, Rennie was talking about the quality of teams they&apos;d already played and his team&apos;s character, while assistant Carl Robinson was talking about just needing consistency: &quot;win every other game and you&apos;re in the playoffs. Lose three in a row and you&apos;re down there and people say you&apos;re a failure. You just want to see them play like that (after Harvey&apos;s goal) when it&apos;s 0-0 not 0-1&quot;. And just as Vancouver were reflecting on turning a bad week, and maybe a bad run, around at the last, Thierry Henry was criticizing the New York media for not believing his prophecies that New York&apos;s own run of good luck in grabbing late winners and equalizers was always going to end:  &quot;I warned you our luck is going away...We had chances to put it in the back of the net in the end, but the luck is going away.&quot;   New York have a break now until June 23. Interesting to see how their self-belief survives Harvey and Vancouver&apos;s moment of catharsis. GP Rocky Mountain teams play two games of one half  Football is a sport rife with cliches, so much so there&apos;s a very popular Twitter account dedicated to keeping track of them all. One of the more familiar is the &quot;game of two halves.&quot; Often a rip-roaring goal fest in the first forty-five minutes can just as easily dissolve into a dirge in the second period, or vice versa.  A pair of MLS Western conference match-ups on Saturday provided a good example. Whether from fatigue from the US Open Cup games midweek or the high altitude or the relatively equal strength of the West as a whole at the moment, the two Rocky mountain fixtures--Real Salt Lake challenging the struggling San Jose Earthquakes at the Rio Tinto, and the in-form Colorado Rapids battling the Western-conference leading FC Dallas--provided their own peaks and valleys to rival the mountainous surroundings, neatly divided by the halftime whistle.  The first 45 at Dick&apos;s Sporting Goods Park was decidedly a valley, at least for the neutral. Ahead of the match, Rapids&apos; head coach Oscar Pareja spoke to his team&apos;s recent success, a matter of putting &quot;defence first.&quot; This was a necessity against FC Dallas, a team that were undefeated in 12 matches and were first in the West with 27 points. The result in practice however was a turgid opening half hour of play, with FC Dallas breaking the monotony with a disallowed goal from Blas Perez followed by a missed shot from Fabian Castillo in the 38th minute. In a boring first half, the Rapids out-fouled Dallas 9 to 4.  What a difference then a goal makes. Or four. After Atiba Harris headed in a long-throw courtesy of Marvel Wynne in the 55th minute, the second half instantly transformed into an altogether different game, with Harris and Perez trading a brace in a ten minute span. That left a final twenty-five minutes in which the Rapids threw off the defensive shackles to rack up chance after chance. Though it ended 2-2, anyone tuning in to watch the last twenty minutes after seeing the first 45 would have been pleasantly surprised. Meanwhile at the Rio Tinto, the effect was reversed. The San Jose Earthquakes&apos; reputation for conceding early only to score more late preceded them against RSL, but the home team seemed determined to squash any hope of a comeback as early as possible. Particularly with Joao Plata, Robbie Findley and Javier Morales in sumptuous form for RSL, who stormed through a San Jose defence missing its centreback strongman Bernarndez on a yellow card suspension. The home team were three goals up by the 38th minute, and there was no sign halftime would halt their momentum. Except it did. After a clearly ineffective start at the tip of Frank Yallop&apos;s too-clever midfield diamond for the Earthquakes, the rookie Adam Jahn was pulled late in the first half in return for Rafael Baca, and Steven Lenhart replaced a seemingly tweaked Sam Cronin. That was enough stability for the Quakes to give their opponents a bit of a game in the second half. Even so Jason Kreis clearly knew the job was done and allowed his players a much-needed rest--RSL was outshot in the second period 6-3. Despite a few threatening shots from Lenhart and co. in the remaining half, the 3-0 first half scoreline held.  Two different games, four very distinct halves. A good advertisement for an MLS Live subscription too; some excellent rewards to be had for the practiced game flipper. RW Groundhog day in Toronto...again In the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, weatherman Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is forced to relive February 2nd over and over again in the small town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. He goes from feelings of hedonism to depression until he eventually settles on self-betterment, both morally and intellectually. In Hollywood fashion, it&apos;s this last phase that finally allows him to wake up to February 3rd (and to Andie MacDowell). Like Phil, Toronto FC, with a few exceptions this season, seem to be reliving the same MLS game over and over again. It goes something like this: TFC manages to look reasonable in possession and careful in attack, with most attempts undone by small details like poor crossing or badly weighted passes. One player stands out (on Saturday it was the young Canadian Jonathan Osorio). The team eventually scores first only to concede the tying or losing goal sometime after the 80th minute, often in stoppage time. They leave the field heartbroken while their head coach defends their overall play in the post-match presser. This was the script yet again against a listless Philadelphia Union tired from their midweek game, forced into making an substitution in the 15th minute when Kleberson picked up a knock, and unable to effectively use the ample space Toronto provided for a counter. Save for Toronto&apos;s relative superiority, the match closely mirrored TFC&apos;s April 13th game against the Union in Philadelphia. Then as now Toronto went down to 10 men (two yellows to Doneil Henry). Then as now Toronto scored first (Osorio header in the 66th minute). Then as now, Jack McInerney, who was quiet just ahead of an ineffective Sebastien Le Toux, was in a brilliant position to score in stoppage time (90+1), scoring his league-leading tenth goal of the season. It would be tempting to write that the late goal, hit by McInerney in the clear on a corner through traffic in the box, was just one of those things for Toronto FC. Yet this season alone the team has conceded five goals in stoppage time. Four of these affected the result. If it&apos;s not bad luck, what is it? First, Toronto needs to score more goals. The team is tied for third in the East for number of goals conceded. That on it&apos;s own is bad, but they&apos;re also fourth last in goals-scored in all of MLS. This means they&apos;re constantly in the position of defending one-goal leads or draws late in the game.  Second, the team needs to learn to hold on to possession in the dying stages of the game. A large portion of their total clearances came in the last five minutes of regulation. Those clearances often went to the feet of a Philadelphia midfielder or defender, or into touch for a Philadelphia throw-in. Ryan Nelsen spoke after the game of getting &quot;overrun&quot; by Philadelphia in the final stages, but it surely doesn&apos;t help when his team makes panicky clearances in rapid succession.  When I mentioned this habit to Ryan Nelsen after the game, he said this would naturally improve as the team &quot;matures&quot; and &quot;gains confidence.&quot; But surely something as simple as this can be coached into a side? Without a world class finisher, it&apos;s something the team will have to learn if they want to wake up to a brand new day. RW The Gold Cup starts now     Bradley, Johnson and Altidore celebrate a US goal against Germany \u2014 but which of their MLS colleagues will be absent from their clubs for international commitments this summer? Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    One of the subplots of the international week and the participation of MLS players has been the release of Jurgen Klinsmann&apos;s MLS heavy provisional roster for the Gold Cup \u2014 an announcement that brings with it all manner of calculus about who might be in position to make a late charge to the edge of the squad for (hopefully) Brazil next year, but also a sense of teams that might be most affected by international call ups for the tournament. Philadelphia Union for example, must have mixed feelings about seeing Jack McInerney, the scoring success story of their season, on the list, while Houston Dynamo, Sporting KC, and Seattle Sounders must have felt similar ambivalence at their own potential loss of key players such as Brad Davis, Graham Zusi, and Eddie Johnson through July \u2014 though Klinsmann has suggested that players he uses in the World Cup qualifying campaign will not be the same as those he uses in the Gold Cup squad. But the effects were already being felt this weekend. With Robbie Keane in Ireland and Omar Gonzalez both bedding himself into the US squad and simultaneously adding question marks about his readiness, the Galaxy were undone in New England. The idea that they might lose a revived Landon Donovan as well, conjures images of their start to last season, without the injured Gonzalez. Without Zusi, Sporting didn&apos;t have the supply line to stop Montreal Impact going top of the East (and adding to Sporting&apos;s recent very poor home form). And while Seattle beat Chivas fairly comfortably, and Obafemi Martins scored for them, they&apos;ll not be comfortable at the prospect of further absences from Brad Evans, let alone Johnson. Teams will also be preparing themselves for other losses to their roster for international duty \u2014 Houston will sorely miss Brad Davis (and potentially Ashe, Bruin, Hall), but add in the likes of Oscar Boniek Garcia as a potential absence for Honduras and their July begins to look very tricky indeed. And yet other sides are hoping that injuries don&apos;t suddenly throw their own players into the spotlight. Dax McCarty&apos;s form for New York might have suggested he&apos;d get a Gold cup look-in, but with his frontrunning team likely playing catch-up by then, as games in hand on them get played, Mike Petke could be forgiven for being happy his midfielder missed out. So as the recent friendlies were played and while most eyes were on the collective drama of the USA&apos;s 4-2 loss to Belgium, or the return to form of Jozy Altidore in the 4-3 win over Germany, some more parochial gazes were monitoring certain players, perhaps in the hope that they might play well for their country, just not yet.

For a start, they had no need to worry if the presence of an Israeli stamp in their passports might complicate future holiday plans. Since January, arrivals at Ben Gurion Airport have been issued with entry cards to be temporarily inserted into travel documents. Uefa&apos;s award of the European Under-21 Championship to a country which, geographically, is part of Asia, is politically loaded. To some, a tournament that starts on Wednesday represents welcome recognition and a fillip for Israeli football, not to mention its many Arab players, while others regard it as another kick in the teeth for Palestinians in the occupied territories. Outside Ben Gurion&apos;s air-conditioned confines temperatures hit a sunny 36C in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Although hot, the air will have felt appreciably more welcoming than over in Doha, where locals frazzled in 40C heat. Nonetheless, England stepped, blinking, into a political firestorm with the potential to rival that surrounded Fifa&apos;s decision to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup. Desmond Tutu, the South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former Archbishop of Cape Town, wrote to this newspaper last Tuesday urging Uefa to move the tournament due to the Jewish state&apos;s alleged treatment of Palestinian sportsmen and women. Part of a concerted campaign highlighting perceived hypocrisies within Uefa&apos;s newly drafted anti-discrimination policies, the letter was co-signed by, among others, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, the former West Ham and Spurs striker. &quot;Uefa agreed new, strict guidelines to deal with racism, suggesting a commendable determination to combat discrimination,&quot; wrote Tutu. &quot;We find it shocking that this same organisation shows total insensitivity to the blatant and entrenched discrimination inflicted on Palestinian sportsmen and women by Israel.&quot; The English game&apos;s ruling body remains undeterred. &quot;The FA has no misgivings and is happy to participate in the tournament,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We&apos;re concentrating on football. We don&apos;t want to mix it with the political landscape.&quot; Israel&apos;s often undulating topography is laced with deceptively confusing contours. While their Under-21 squad contain six Israeli-Arab players \u2013 an accurate reflection of the country, where around 20% of the population is made up of such citizens \u2013 their lives are very different to those of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who lack citizenship and its attendant rights and find daily life riddled with frequent restrictions. The hurdles faced by Palestinian footballers, who have their own, Fifa-registered national side, were highlighted in November when more than 50 players from Europe&apos;s major leagues, including Arsenal&apos;s Abou Diaby and Newcastle&apos;s Sylvian Marveaux, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Cheik Tiot\u00e9, signed a petition demanding Uefa relocate the Under-21 tournament. In a statement they described the choice of venue as &quot;yet another stain on the world&apos;s conscience&quot; and expressed &quot;solidarity with the people of Gaza who are living under siege and denied basic human dignity and freedom&quot;. Specific examples were cited, including the following: &quot;On November 10, 2012, the Israeli army bombed a sports stadium in Gaza resulting in the death of four young people playing football.&quot; The Israeli government claims Hamas was using the ground to launch rockets. Meanwhile, 20 British MPs signed a parliamentary motion registering &quot;profound disapproval&quot; that the FA is supporting an event in a country with &quot;a policy of racial apartheid against Palestinians&quot;. Such dissent failed to dent the Israeli FA&apos;s delight. &quot;The protests were reported in a minor way here,&quot; said Allon Sinai, the chief sports writer at the Jerusalem Post. &quot;They were mentioned, nothing more. This tournament is very big for the IFA; it&apos;s everything for them. They were very happy when they got it \u2013 and very surprised.&quot; Diplomatically, England will visit anti-racism initiatives and community projects featuring Arab-Jewish integration, Ethiopian immigrants and Bedouin women&apos;s football over the next fortnight. &quot;The work is of huge social benefit to local communities, regardless of religion or beliefs,&quot; said David Bernstein, the FA chairman. &quot;Football should always be a tool for good.&quot; As Pearce&apos;s squad settle into their hotel ahead of group matches against Italy in Tev Aviv on Wednesday, Norway in Petah Tikva on Saturday and Israel in Jerusalem next Tuesday, they may well feel as confused as Claire Foy&apos;s Erin in The Promise. Peter Kosminsky&apos;s Bafta-nominated drama serial, broadcast on Channel 4 in 2011, cast Foy as a young woman visiting Israel and discovering the truth about her solider grandfather&apos;s time in Palestine during the final years of the British Mandate. Among many other things she learns is that in Israel the past is omnipresent and contradictions lurk round every corner.

Except here at Fiver Towers, where football never, ever stops. &quot;In the first half we were far too cautious,&quot; said a kind, gentle, elderly man named Mr Roy with an owlish countenance last night, shortly after football had stopped in Rio. &quot;It was understandable because it was a different pitch to the type we&apos;re used to,&quot; he added, for the benefit of those who might not have noticed just how different the large, grass-covered rectangle on which his team had drawn 2-2 with Brazil was compared to the completely different large, grass covered rectangles to which they are more usually accustomed. But after a half-time interval during which that team may well have been subjected to a managerial dressing down that was almost certainly &quot;slightly cross&quot;, England showed they can actually play a bit from time to time, even going so far as taking an unlikely lead courtesy of goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wayne Rooney, before eventually remembering their place in the cosmic scheme of things and politely letting Brazil do an equaliser to make sure that it was all square when football stopped. England manager Mr Roy has every right to be pleased with the result, not least because it will buy him time from increasingly sceptical critics ahead of his side&apos;s next underwhelming performance, probably against Ukraine in September&apos;s vital qualifier for next summer&apos;s 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122 with Adidas, Coca-Cola, Hyundai, Emirates, Sony, Visa, Budweiser, Castrol, Continental, Johnson + Johnson, McDonald&apos;s, Oi Seara, Yingli, Apex Brasil, Centauro, Garoto, Itau, Liberty Seguros, Wise Up and Football For Hope in Brazil.

One West Ham season ticket holder was given a lifetime ban by the club following an investigation by the Metropolitan police in the aftermath of the 3-1 defeat by Tottenham at White Hart Lane in November, when a group of away fans were heard hissing and chanting the name of Adolf Hitler. Two Millwall fans were arrested and charged by police and given lifetime bans by the club after undercover Sky Sports News footage exposed racist abuse during matches against Birmingham City in October and Leeds in November. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;In all honesty, I didn&apos;t have to think too long or too hard about it. It just wasn&apos;t for me. Forget that the financial offer in itself was quite poor, but I would have been taking three steps backwards in my development as a professional coach if I had gone. I walked out of that meeting with the club&apos;s board and football director Dave Bassett, and said &apos;Wow&apos;. It just blew me away. Being one of the bigger lower league clubs, I was expecting a lot more in terms of how they wanted to develop as a club on the field. But they just didn&apos;t seem interested when I was talking about playing a short passing game and taking the football another level up.

Stones, coins and seats were among the assorted missiles launched at the England Under-21 players on that poisonous October evening in Serbia when they were subjected to racist as well as physical abuse. &quot;No matter what we come up against in this tournament, it&apos;s not going to be like the situation we faced that night,&quot; Butland says. &quot;We know that we dealt with it incredibly well.&quot; Butland is talking in Israel before England&apos;s opening group game of the European Championship finals, a tournament that was the prize for all they endured in the second leg of their play-off against Serbia. Stuart Pearce&apos;s side take on Italy in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, when the absence of the suspended Danny Rose, who was sent off in Krusevac, and Tom Ince, who also received a one-match ban for improper conduct, provides another reminder of the ordeal that they went through in Serbia. While those ugly scenes are not something that Butland would ever wish to experience again, the Stoke City goalkeeper believes that the events of eight months ago have had a galvanising effect on Pearce&apos;s squad, who come into these finals on the back of nine straight victories which were all achieved without conceding a goal. &quot;Throughout the game in Serbia, you could see in the lads&apos; eyes it was a very tough situation, and after the game, in the changing rooms, you could see that again,&quot; Butland says. &quot;You could feel that we had got through an extremely difficult scenario. You could see on the lads&apos; faces it was emotional for us. I think that&apos;s what has brought us closer together because of what we have been through. We showed no matter what situation we are put in that we can handle it. &quot;[That night] I was getting a bit more from behind the goal than I was from in front of the goal. There was all sorts being thrown. Anything from seats, to what they were supposed to be eating, and little stones, there was a couple of rocks, that was in the second half. In the first half coins were thrown. But that just gave us more drive in a difficult scenario to go on and win the game.&quot; Butland speaks with such confidence and maturity that it is difficult to believe he will not turn 21 until March next year. The Bristolian has already packed plenty into a burgeoning career, including being part of the squad that Roy Hodgson took to Euro 2012, representing Team GB in the Olympics and winning his first senior England cap at the age of 19 years and 158 days, when he started in a friendly against Italy last August at a time when his only experience of league football was a loan spell at Cheltenham Town. There is, however, a burning desire to achieve more, which shines through when Butland, who joined Stoke from Birmingham City in a \u00a34m deal in January, is asked about his prospects of going to the World Cup finals next summer. &quot;I&apos;m not going to stand here and think three places are taken and just give up. I&apos;ve got to prove that I&apos;m good enough to go,&quot; Butland says. &quot;I don&apos;t see the fact that I&apos;ve come down to the Under-21s as a bad thing. &quot;Conversations were had and this is probably the best thing for my development. I know that going to the senior squad [for the friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil] would have been fantastic but in terms of game-time it would be better to stay here. &quot;I feel really good in this squad and I feel part of it. But everyone wants to get those senior caps and we know this is a great platform. And I feel very confident that, if I get the opportunity to have a good tournament, and then a good season next year, hopefully in the Premier League with Stoke, then the target is to go to Rio.&quot; There was no shortage of motivation on Sunday night, when Butland watched Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Rodwell, a couple of his former England Under-21 team-mates, play in the 2-2 draw against Brazil. With the two-hour time difference in Israel, it was past Butland&apos;s bedtime by the time the game finished but he saw enough to know where he wants to be in the future. &quot;It&apos;s an inspiration,&quot; he says. &quot;The fact that Alex and Jack came on after coming through the Under-21 set-up says a lot about the opportunities. I am very proud for them, especially Alex coming on and scoring the goal he did, he brought a lot of life to the game. That&apos;s definitely the stage we want to get to, playing in the Maracan\u00e3 in Brazil. But doing well here is the first step.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-03T22:00:04Z", "title": "Jack Butland says Serbian abuse of England Under-21's 'made us stronger'", "sentences": ["Stuart Pearce&apos;s side take on Italy in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, when the absence of the suspended Danny Rose, who was sent off in Krusevac, and Tom Ince, who also received a one-match ban for improper conduct, provides another reminder of the ordeal that they went through in Serbia."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/jack-butland-england-under-21-serbia"}, {"tags": ["Media", "Alexander Lebedev", "Mail on Sunday", "Russia", "Israel", "Vladimir Putin", "The Independent", "London Evening Standard"], "article": "   How the Mail on Sunday reported on Polonsky in Israel as Lebedev faces trial    The bizarre events surrounding the prosecution of Alexander Lebedev in Russia have reached a farcical level. His accuser, Sergei Polonsky, is taunting him with tweets from Israel and showing no signs of turning up in Moscow to give evidence at the trial. He was tracked down by the Mail on Sunday&apos;s reporter, Christian Gysin, to a luxury apartment in Tel Aviv.  But Polonsky is aware that the authorities will go ahead without him, accepting his written statement about Lebedev having assaulted him on TV and allowing him not to be cross-examined. Lebedev, who has been charged with hooliganism, claims he was provoked by Polonsky, a real estate tycoon, before they stepped before the TV cameras in September 2011. Lebedev was then seen by viewers to punch Polonsky. It is possible that the future of the newspapers owned by Lebedev&apos;s family - including The Independent and London Evening Standard - hangs on the outcome of his trial. The auguries do not look good for Lebedev. Acquittal in Russia is rare. In 2010, it was estimated that the country had a 99% conviction rate. And there is a political dimension to the case. President Putin is no friend of Lebedev&apos;s and he is known to be extremely irritated by the editorial content of a Moscow paper co-owned by Lebedev, Novaya Gazeta. If found guilty, Lebedev could be jailed for five years. It is uncertain what would then happen to his Russian business interests, the foundation of his fortune.

Speaking on the eve of England&apos;s opening game, against Italy in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, Pearce said he was looking forward to discussing his future with the Football Association in a fortnight&apos;s time, when he hopes to be given the opportunity to extend his six-year tenure. Although there has been no indication as yet that Pearce will be offered a new deal when his contract expires at the end of the month, the 51-year-old has made it clear that he thoroughly enjoys his current role. He said he retains a &quot;real passion&quot; for working with younger players and also suggested that he has no desire to return to club management. Pearce, who has led England Under\u201121s to an unprecedented four successive European Championship finals, expects to sit down with Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA&apos;s director of football development, once the tournament is over. Greg Dyke, who will officially take over as FA chairman from David Bernstein at the start of next month, will also be involved in the talks. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to seeing Trevor Brooking in regard to my future,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;Absolutely delighted with the job I do. No matter what the results of this tournament, [I&apos;m] looking forward to sitting down with the FA in two weeks&apos; time. &quot;I&apos;ve had a fantastic relationship with David Bernstein, because obviously of my Manchester City links with him. But I would fully expect Mr Dyke to come in and be a full part of [the decision-making process]. But that&apos;s for the FA. If Trevor decides he&apos;s dealing with it personally, fine. But I&apos;m sure there will be discussions with regard to the rest.&quot; Asked whether he was keen to continue as Under-21 manager, Pearce replied: &quot;Yeah, I enjoy the role. It&apos;s fantastic. As I say, nothing&apos;s changed with me or with the FA, I think.&quot; Although Pearce&apos;s future has been unclear in the lead-up to previous European Championship finals, he has never before spoken of his determination to remain in charge before a tournament ball has been kicked. By making his stance clear this time Pearce has prevented the issue from becoming a distraction during a tournament which he hopes will end with England winning their first European Championship title since 1984. That promises to be quite an ask, even allowing for the fact that England have put together a run of nine straight victories. This, after all, is not an England squad blessed with supreme individual talent. In the 23-man group only five players \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne, Steven Caulker, Andre Wisdom, Jordan Henderson and Danny Rose \u2013 started 10 Premier League games or more last season. There also looks to be a shortage of attacking options, especially if Wilfried Zaha is unable to overcome the ankle problem which is expected to rule him out of the Italy game. While it would not be in Pearce&apos;s nature to think of anything other than bringing the trophy home, the manager pointed out, when asked what would constitute success in Israel, that it was quite an achievement to keep qualifying for the finals. &quot;In some ways success, when you look at my time in charge, four tournaments\u2026 France have not been here once and they are a major side, so to get here and be part of this fantastic tournament is a success in itself,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;When we start our journey every two years, we sit our players down and we talk about winning the tournament. We&apos;re here to win \u2013 that is the message I only ever send out to the squad. On top of that it will be how many players can get tournament experience here \u2013 the likes of Jordan Henderson, who can step into the seniors next time round. &quot;So there is a multitude of things; if I strip it down to a burning ambition inside me, it is to win it; if I strip it down to me doing my job developing the 23 players here at the moment\u2026 hopefully we will get a few of them stepping forward. Roll the clock back and you have [Chris] Smalling, [Phil] Jones, Kyle Walker, [Danny] Welbeck, [Daniel] Sturridge, all in the seniors who were on this stage two years ago.&quot; Pearce said he believes Italy are the favourites in a group which also includes Norway, whom England beat home and away in qualifying, and Israel, the hosts. &quot;We are going in on the back of winning nine games not conceding a goal, so confidence is very strong. But sometimes you can&apos;t judge [how strong a squad is] until after a tournament is finished or even until a year later,&quot; he said. &quot;Take the Germans when we played them [in the final in 2009] and got beaten 4-0, albeit with [Joe] Hart, [Gabriel] Agbonlahor and Fraizer Campbell suspended, which really shook us. It wasn&apos;t until a year later, the World Cup in South Africa, that people started to hear about [Mesut] Ozil, [J\u00e9r\u00f4me] Boateng, [Sami] Khedira and [Manuel] Neuer, to see the magnitude of the opposition, and the same will apply this time around. &quot;Experience tells me don&apos;t judge the tournament until a year down the line, when some of these national teams go to Brazil and one or two individuals you have not heard of now, all of a sudden they are household names and senior internationals.&quot; It is hoped that a couple of young England players will be among them.

Outplayed for almost the entire match, they succumbed to a free-kick from the best player on the pitch, leaving them bottom of Group A and facing elimination if they lose to Norway \u2013 who drew 2-2 with Israel earlier in the evening \u2013 on Saturday. It was the first goal England Under-21s have conceded in 889 minutes of football and brought an end to a nine-match winning run. Questions will be asked about whether Jack Butland should have been beaten at his near post and also if the wall did its job but England could have no complaints about the outcome. Inspired by Insigne, who was been a regular in the Napoli side and on this evidence will soon be a permanent fixture in the senior team, Italy exposed all too familiar weaknesses in an England team that looked painfully short tactically and technically. Unable to keep the ball and string together coherent passing moves, they were powerless to stem the Italian tide. One statistic sums up how miserable a night this was for Stuart Pearce&apos;s side. Marco Verratti, the accomplished Paris St-Germain midfielder, made 120 passes, which was 76 more than any England player. In other words England spent much of the match chasing shadows and trying to soak up pressure, which brings back uncomfortable memories of the Euro 2012 quarter-final between these two nations last summer, when Italy triumphed on penalties after dominating the previous 120 minutes. England did have a goal disallowed in strange circumstances early in the second half, when Craig Dawson&apos;s header was ruled out after Antony Gautier, the French referee, belatedly penalised Steven Caulker for a foul, but Pearce knew better than to bemoan that incident. Italy, as the England manager admitted, had been denied a clear penalty towards the end of the first half, when Jack Robinson, deputising for the suspended Danny Rose at left-back, brought down Alessandro Florenzi. For Pearce, who 24 hours earlier had said that he wants to stay on as Under-21 manager in the long term, this was a chastening evening. &quot;We were awful in the first half,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought the performance was very poor, I thought the best team won the game. Once Dawson scored we thought we got our noses in front, which would have given us a touch more confidence, but I think overall on the night it was a poor performance, which is unlike us.&quot; Asked what disappointed him most, Pearce replied: &quot;Probably one or two of our bigger players didn&apos;t perform for whatever reason. I felt we could have caused the Italians a problem if we had just been a bit more cultured with our final pass, which just wasn&apos;t good enough to hurt the opposition. As always, I&apos;ll give you an honest assessment of what I saw. It wasn&apos;t good enough from us and the players know that.&quot; Pearce gave some praise to Nathan Redmond, who showed flashes of promise on his Under-21 debut, but it was hard to pick out anyone else in an England shirt who emerged with credit. Tom Ince, who was suspended, will be available for the Norway match and will bring some much needed creativity to the team, but there is no indication that Wilfried Zaha, the most gifted player in the squad, will have recovered from the ankle problem that prevented him from featuring. Italy, in truth, were superior in every department and the only surprise was that they took so long to score. The wonderfully named Ciro Immobile shot wide, Insigne wasted a couple of decent chances and Butland denied Fabio Borino, before Nathaniel Clyne committed the foul that led to the goal. Insigne, who shimmered with menace on the left, curled a fine free-kick inside the near post. England came close to pilfering an equaliser with the last kick of the game, when Jordan Henderson&apos;s free-kick was beaten away by Francesco Bardi, but that would have only papered over the cracks on a hugely underwhelming night. &quot;The way I look at it we&apos;re probably in a three-team group, us Norway and Israel, and they&apos;ve got the march on us because of the point they&apos;ve both got,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;I think probably we&apos;ll have to win both games but that&apos;s tournament football.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-05T22:28:00Z", "title": "England Under-21s 0-1 Italy Under-21s | European Under-21 Championship match report", "sentences": ["The crucial blow came late but it was no more than Italy, and in particular Lorenzo Insigne, deserved on a balmy night in Tel Aviv, one which ended with England making the worst possible start to these finals."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/05/england-under-21-italy-israel"}, {"tags": ["Richard Desmond", "National Lottery", "Northern & Shell", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "UK news", "Charities", "Society", "Charitable giving", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Voluntary sector"], "article": "Richard Desmond has expressed an interest in bidding to run a &quot;bigger, better&quot; National Lottery, with ticket prices of \u00a31, when the licence next comes up for renewal. Desmond, who has been at loggerheads with National Lottery operator Camelot since unveiling his rival the Health Lottery in February 2011, made the claim following comments reportedly made by the rival company&apos;s chief executive, Dianne Thompson. Thompson, who led a failed high court bid to get the Health Lottery&apos;s gambling licence revoked, has said that it is a &quot;possibility&quot; that Camelot might not look to bid to renew the licence it has held for 19 years because of the Health Lottery.

I will put the ticket prices back to a pound.&quot; Camelot declined to comment.

At 380 soldiers and officers, the Austrians comprise a little over a third of the total deployment, known as Undof. For 40 years it has had the task of maintaining a cold peace between Israel and Syria along land that was seized by Israeli forces in 1967 then in effect annexed 14 years later. For 38 of those years, it was one of the most straightforward jobs in global peacekeeping. Barely a stone had crossed the fence between the two sides. The Golan was the safest of Israel&apos;s four borders. Now it is anything but. The understanding forged between the two sides had been deep and abiding. The Israelis knew the location of Syrian positions, who their leaders were, and the formations of their divisions. The Syrians knew that the Israelis wouldn&apos;t cross the line nor aggressively patrol it. The few disputes that did arise were easily mediated by Undof, until mid-2011. In the summer of that year, protesters descended on the Golan fence line and simultaneously moved towards parts of Lebanon&apos;s border fence with Israel. It was the first signal that things were changing; the message from Syria and Iran was that &quot;your borders will not be safe as long as ours aren&apos;t&quot;. Ever since, the situation in the Golan has steadily deteriorated. By late last year, the equivalent of two Syrian Army divisions had been moved out of the Golan region and used to reinforce the defences of Damascus. By then, other groups had begun to fill the void. First among them were the mainstream rebel organisations, who loosely fight under the banner of the Free Syria Army. But jihadists, who see the chaos in Syria as a forum for their own ambitions \u2014 particularly to strike against Israel \u2014 also started to arrive. Fire aimed at Israeli positions on the Golan over the past six months is thought to have come mainly from the jihadists, and sometimes from the remnants of the regime army itself. All the while, the Austrians had been getting anxious. So too had a Filipino contingent from Undof, whose members had twice been kidnapped then released in recent months, underscoring how quickly security has been deteriorating. Israel well knows the perils of being drawn directly in to the Syrian conflict. It has sent numerous messages to Damascus through Russian diplomats to stress that its interests lie first with making sure that new strategic weapons are not passed to Hezbollah in Lebanon, second in ensuring that chemical weapons are not used or handed on and third that the Golan doesn&apos;t become a new front for the civil war. With all three goals looking shaky, along with the future of Undof itself, officials in Tel Aviv have mooted the idea of doing more to secure the border. That could mean a more robust posture inside current defences or, as senior European diplomats believe, potentially the creation of a buffer zone across the ceasefire line. Such a move would mark a significant moment in Syria&apos;s war. Buffer zones haven&apos;t worked out well for the Israelis in recent decades \u2013 the Lebanon experience still rankles. However, allowing a security vacuum to become established in such strategically sensitive lands doesn&apos;t appear to be much of an option either. With Syria gradually unwinding, Israel has made a series of high-stakes decisions \u2013 three air strikes on Syrian soil \u2013 that have not yet changed the status quo. Bashar al-Assad has warned that a fourth such attack will meet with a response, and the Golan Heights seems the most likely place to deliver it.

Speaking on the back of England Under-21s&apos; disappointing 1-0 defeat against Italy in their opening group game in the European Championship finals in Israel, Pearce expressed his frustration with continually being unable to call upon the best young players in the country. While Pearce accepted Glenn Hoddle was &quot;within his rights&quot; to strongly criticise the performance against Italy, the England Under-21s manager pointed out that he was without the services of 17 players, including a number of senior internationals, such as Phil Jones, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Rodwell. In contrast, Italy&apos;s Under-21s coach, Devis Mangia, made a point of thanking Cesare Prandelli, the manager of the national team, for allowing him to pick Marco Verratti, the Paris St-Germain midfielder who has three full caps to his name and was outstanding against England in Tel Aviv. Pearce, whose contract expires at the end of the month, said: &quot;If you bring your best players, you stand a chance of winning the tournament. If you don&apos;t bring your best players, you take your chance when you get there. That applies to every country in the world. &quot;You&apos;ve got to understand, and you don&apos;t want to mention it, but I could have named you 13 players that could have been here. I&apos;ve had two players suspended and two injured, so that&apos;s 17 players. You take 17 players out of the Italian squad and let&apos;s see the result [on Wednesday night].&quot; While Pearce accepts Roy Hodgson should have &quot;first dibs&quot; when it comes to naming his squad, he said research shows England&apos;s senior players have less tournament experience than all but one of the leading nations. Some players, Pearce acknowledged, will be unavailable for legitimate reasons, but he claimed that &quot;one or two do not want to give their summers up to go and represent their country \u2026 that&apos;s just how it is.&quot; Asked what needs to change in terms of the bigger picture, Pearce replied: &quot;I will tell you now what you need to do to win a tournament and be successful. It was exactly the same as the French, Spanish and Germans before us. They have all done this prior to us. You qualify with your best players, you take your best team to the tournament. That is the only way you will have a hope of being successful. The statistics back that up. &quot;We have done a study over the last 10 years. In that time, only Spain surpass us in terms of qualification for tournaments, from under-17 level to the seniors. But when you flip it on its head and ask how many of our top 50 players who are playing in the senior squad now have got tournament experience before they get there, we finish second bottom of the group. &quot;That study is around the top seven teams in Europe. It also incorporates the four top teams in South America and Mexico. The statistics are there. It is whether you want to ignore them and think it doesn&apos;t matter, &apos;we will just turn up and try to win a World Cup&apos;. Or do you want to put the building blocks in place? &quot;Experience is exactly that. I made my England debut when I was 25. I had 20 caps before the World Cup in Italy but nothing prepared me for stepping out into the pressure that came my way. From that experience, I said: &apos;That can&apos;t be right.&apos; It is a pathway I do not want young players to tread. I want them to get that experience [of tournaments] before. &quot;You only have to look at the development of Theo Walcott. He went to the World Cup in 2006. Since then, he could have gone to two World Cups, two European Championships, three under-21 European Championships, two under-20 World Cups and an Olympic Games, age permitting. I think he has only played five and a half tournament matches. We have to address that, so our brighter players, like the Oxlade-Chamberlains, can get tournament experience \u2013 playing time \u2013 and don&apos;t just go to them.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-06T21:30:02Z", "title": "England players need tournament experience, says Stuart Pearce", "sentences": ["In contrast, Italy&apos;s Under-21s coach, Devis Mangia, made a point of thanking Cesare Prandelli, the manager of the national team, for allowing him to pick Marco Verratti, the Paris St-Germain midfielder who has three full caps to his name and was outstanding against England in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/06/england-stuart-pearce-under-21s"}, {"tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "article": "Sheffield Doc/Fest Sheffield doesn&apos;t quite have the same ring as Cannes or Venice, but in documentary terms it&apos;s a fair comparison.

The New York Times, citing senior American officials, said computer software, hardware and training was being provided to pro-Washington countries in the Persian Gulf to diffuse the growing threat from Tehran.  Plans to bolster the computer defences of US allies will be extended to parts of Asia in a bid to blunt the perceived threat of network attacks from North Korea. The Obama administration has long been believed to have been involved in cyberwarfare against Tehran, with earlier reports suggesting the president ordered a series of sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run the country&apos;s nuclear programme. On Friday, the Guardian further revealed that Obama had set up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks. The leaked directive authorises the use of cyber-attacks on foreign nations whenever &quot;US nationals interests and equities&quot; are at stake, and specifies that cyber warfare can be used as &quot;anticipatory action&quot; against &quot;imminent threats&quot;. The New York Times article suggests that accompanying a more aggressive approach to conducting cyberwarfare, Washington is looking to thwart attacks from regimes hostile to the US. The catalyst to boosting the defences of allies seems to have been two recent high-profile attacks \u2013 one against Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil industry, thought have been conducted from Iran, and an alleged North Korean hack of banks and media companies in South Korea. A US official told the New York Times that the Iranian attack was &quot;a real wake-up call&quot; which prompted the Pentagon to draw up proposals to provide allies with better computer defences. It comes as Iran attempts to hire computer programmers associated with illegal hacking, some from Russia.  The US is not the only country to express concern over Tehran&apos;s apparent increased attack on cyber security. On Sunday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of carrying out &quot;non-stop&quot; attacks on its computer systems. &quot;In the past few months, we have identified a significant increase in the scope of cyber-attacks on Israel by Iran.

Stuart Pearce will almost certainly be a casualty of England&apos;s humiliating early exit at the European Under-21 Championship, although anyone who thinks that appointing a new manager will solve everything is deluded. If it is hard to argue with the idea that it is time for Pearce&apos;s six-year reign to come to an end, especially when the manager resorts to asking centre-halfs to play as centre-forwards \u2013 as he did in the final 15 minutes of the sobering 3-1 defeat against Norway on Saturday \u2013 the reality is that the reasons behind the poor performances England have delivered in Israel run deeper than the tactical shortcomings of the man in charge. First and foremost, the Football Association needs to decide whether it is serious about trying to win the Under-21 European Championship, or if Roy Hodgson, the England coach, and the rest of the governing body are happy to go through the motions every two years and prioritise international friendlies instead. One thing is clear, after failing to win any of their previous eight European Championship tournament matches in normal time, England are not good enough to be competitive at under-21 level with a shadow squad. Whether Pearce would have got the best out of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Phil Jones, Danny Welbeck et al is a matter for debate, but something is clearly wrong when the Italy Under-21 coach is thanking the manager of the senior team for making Marco Verratti, a full international, available for the opening group game in Tel Aviv \u2013 where England gave two teenagers debuts and lost 1-0. For England, though, the Norway result was the tipping point and suggested there are wider issues to be addressed. While it is understandable to think they will never win the tournament without their best players \u2013 which has been Pearce&apos;s message for years \u2013 there is no excuse for losing so abjectly to a Norway side who had four of their regular starters on the bench because they had played for the senior team against Albania the night before. The Norway defeat was one of those rare occasions when, in the wake of a poor England display, we were not left bemoaning the team&apos;s inability to retain the ball. England made 462 completed passes compared with Norway&apos;s 156 and enjoyed 69% of possession. A bigger problem was knowing how to use the ball intelligently \u2013 for all their dominance, England registered only one more goal attempt than Norway. At the other end of the pitch, England&apos;s defence was, to quote Pearce, &quot;a disaster&quot;. A defence that failed to concede in nine matches across 19 months has been breached four times in 62 minutes of football here. As much as Pearce must carry the can, the England players have hardly covered themselves in glory. Indeed, on the back of the defeats against Italy and Norway the natural conclusion to draw is that, with the star names missing, England have a paucity of talent at under-21 level. Research carried out by the CIES Football Observatory revealed last week that the playing time of English footballers under the age of 21 in the Premier League has fallen to its lowest ever level. For too long, the Premier League and its member clubs have been preoccupied with serving their own interests, which means generating as much money as possible and focusing on short-term success. The corollary is that homegrown players have fewer chances to break through than in any of the other leading nations. As for the FA, it is now playing catch up at St George&apos;s Park, the national football centre, after finally waking up to the fact that there is a lack of highly qualified coaches in England compared with the other leading nations. Increasing those numbers will take time, as will the benefits of the elite player performance plan, which it is hard to be optimistic about when there are so few pathways to the first team. In the meantime, Pearce will take charge of the England Under-21 team against Israel on Tuesday evening for what looks like being his final game. Gareth Southgate and Peter Taylor, who had two previous spells in charge of the Under-21s, are leading contenders to replace him, with the FA unlikely to move for either Glenn Hoddle or Steve McClaren, two former England coaches.

He fought in the 1948 war from which it emerged independent, but, along with some other writers of his generation, he became disillusioned with his homeland, disenchanted with its very spirit. &quot;The state I took part in founding had ended long ago and I am not interested in what it has become. It\u00a0is ludicrous, blunt, vile, dark, sick, and it will not last. We used to think it would be different.&quot; In the half century up to his death, he published 29 books, most of them novels, with subjects ranging from the 1948 war, the Holocaust and the occupation of territories gained in 1967 to parent-child relationships and ageing. Among his best-known are Hemo, King of Jerusalem (1968), the story of a wounded soldier in a Jerusalem hospital; Nevelot (Carcasses, 1997), about three old men who go on a murderous rampage against young people on the streets of Tel Aviv; Confessions of a Good Arab (1984), recounting the life of a man of Israeli-Palestinian descent; and His Daughter (1988), telling how a senior army officer&apos;s daughter goes missing, and he goes on\u00a0a\u00a0journey to find her, and himself. In terms of style, Kaniuk is identified not so much with his own generation as the next one, and many of his books were adapted for cinema by young Israeli film directors. In the international production of his 1971 novel Adam Resurrected (2008), directed by Paul Schrader, Jeff Goldblum plays a circus entertainer from prewar Berlin leading the death camp survivors in an Israeli asylum. Kaniuk&apos;s last book, Ba Bayamim (An Old Man), in which a widow asks a lonely old painter to produce a portrait of her dead husband, was published a few weeks before his death. Born in Tel Aviv, Kaniuk was the epitome of Israeli &quot;aristocracy&quot;. His mother, Sarah, had come from Odessa. His father, Moshe Kaniuk, born in Galicia, went from Berlin to Palestine in the late 1920s and became personal secretary to Tel Aviv&apos;s first mayor, Meir Disengof. Later he became the first administrative director of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Yoram joined Palmach \u2013 the combat arm of the Zionist militia Hagana \u2013 in the period that saw the end of the British Mandate, the UN resolution on partition, and the outbreak of the 1948 war. He took part in some of the battles around Jerusalem: in one, the battle of Nabi Samuel, he and his platoon were abandoned by their commander, a defining moment which reappeared in his writing. A week later he was injured while fighting on Mount Zion. Once he had recovered, he started working on a ship that brought Holocaust survivors from Europe to Israel. He was encouraged by one of the period&apos;s most acclaimed artists, Mordecai Ardon, to study painting in the Bezalel art academy. In 1951 he continued his studies for a year in Paris. After another voyage as a sailor, he lived in the US for 10 years, and from there pursued adventure, searching for gold in Mexico and diamonds in Guatemala, and gambling in Las Vegas. He got involved in jazz and cinema circles, where he got to know Marlon Brando, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday and the dancer and choreographer Lee Becker, who became his first wife. He described those years of the 1950s as, alongside the 1948 war, the most influential on his life and work. &quot;It was the time of the revolution that changed America, and everybody paid for it. It was a powerful experience, the love of jazz, the efforts to become a writer and a poet, the encounters with all the people whom I have hurt, and who&apos;ve hurt me,&quot; he told the daily Ma&apos;ariv in 2003. He parted from Becker after five stormy years. In 1958 he married Miranda Baker, and went with her back\u00a0to Israel. They had two daughters, Aya, a\u00a0writer and political activist, and Naomi, a tai chi therapist. In 2011 Kaniuk, defiant to the end, won his legal battle when the district court in Tel Aviv accepted his appeal to change the religion clause on his Israeli identity card from &quot;Jewish&quot; to &quot;no religion&quot;. Kaniuk explained that while he did not want to convert to another religion, he had never identified as a\u00a0religious Jew. In addition, following his marriage to a Christian woman, his grandson had been registered as having &quot;no religion&quot;. He wanted his registration to match his grandson&apos;s. The ruling is a milestone in Israel&apos;s constitutional law. The distinctions between religion, nationality and ethnicity carry vast political implications in the state that defines itself as &quot;Jewish&quot;. He was equally uncompromising about the manner of his exit: there will be no funeral, as Kaniuk donated his body to scientific research and asked for his remains to be burned. &quot;I don&apos;t want to leave any bone dust behind. We\u00a0constitute a chain: one exits, another enters,&quot; he wrote in his last blog entry. He also left a few paragraphs of painful reproach to the Israel he had left behind: &quot;We got trapped. We founded a state on a religion, rather than on the nation that we have nearly become. On our way we have not stopped at the hallway of civilisation, and religion has stuck to us like a leech, as that&apos;s its only way to survive, and here it is. It is back. We have not become a nation.&quot; This autumn his memoir of the war, Tashah (&quot;1948&quot;, first published in 2010), will appear in French, English, Spanish and German translations. He is survived by Miranda, his daughters and his grandson. \u2022 Yoram Kaniuk, writer, born 2 May 1930; died 8 June 2013 \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2013.

Having finally been dragged out of an all-amateur era, Australia&apos;s first tilt at qualification was, somewhat appropriately given the game&apos;s historical ties, for the 1966 World Cup in England. The route was set to be arduous with Africa, Asia and Oceania all vying for a lone ticket. However, African nations withdrew en bloc in protest at not being granted an automatic continental berth, South Africa were banned because of apartheid, and South Korea ultimately elected not to participate. A gruelling campaign had become seemingly straightforward. That just left North Korea. Finding a venue, however, proved troublesome. Cambodia, an ally of Pyongyang&apos;s leadership, came to the rescue and the newly built Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium \u2013 a classic Communist style concrete structure - was the venue for a contest to be played over two matches. In truth, one match would prove more than enough to demonstrate the gulf between the teams. A four-week boot camp in North Queensland and a scratch match against local opposition was deemed to be enough preparation for the Socceroos&apos; World Cup campaign. Most of the squad had not travelled internationally for football, let alone to such a foreign environment. But the Aussies were unprepared off the field as well as on it, and by the time the match came around many were ill after consuming the local water.  The fleet-footed and skilful Koreans went one up early although Australia held firm until the hour mark. Then injuries, a noisy 60,000 crowd, and of course, a vastly superior opponent, took their toll. The North Koreans were easy 6-1 victors with Les Scheinflug&apos;s penalty on 70 minutes a lone, though historic, consolation. Johnny Warren later aptly described the match as &quot;Australia&apos;s sporting Gallipoli&quot;, and it was hard to argue with the analogy. Remarkably, goal aggregate was not taken into consideration, and thus a victory for Australia in the return would have meant a third and deciding match. That was never likely, and despite an improved display for Australia, and another goal for Scheinflug, they lost 3-1. The Koreans famously proved their quality on a far bigger stage, notching an unthinkable group stage win over Italy before they narrowly failed to reach the 1966 World Cup semi-finals. 2) Australia 1-0 South Korea (Hong Kong, November 1973)  For decades it was an achievement that stood out as a singular beacon on a desolate landscape.

So too an equally epic globe-trotting campaign four years earlier had indirectly laid the platform for success.  Earlier in the year Australia had seen off New Zealand, Indonesia and, in their first ever meeting, Iraq. Then came a backs-to-the-wall aggregate win over Iran. The final hurdle was home and away against South Korea. The first leg in Sydney was a scoreless stalemate, and the return an action-packed 2-2 draw in Seoul. Australia had to come from two goals down to earn a share of the spoils, but unlike the Iran tie some 24 years later, away goals were not considered. Thus a hastily arranged third match took place in Hong Kong. Remarkably, the match was played just 72 hours later. Korea had enjoyed the better of the first two encounters yet had nothing to show for it. The teams shared the same flight to Hong Kong and crafty Scottish-born midfielder Jimmy Rooney described the Koreans as looking broken. In truth, the decisive match was relatively unremarkable in terms of incident. Despite Australia turning in one of their most fluid performances of the era, the deadlocked remained. Finally on the hour mark came the decisive moment. An unconvincing clearance fell to Rooney who instinctively cushioned the ball into the path of his best mate Jimmy Mackay. The ensuring strike from 30 metres into the top corner was pure perfection with the ball seemingly still rising as it found its way inside the frame of the goal.  Unlike John Aloisi&apos;s much venerated strike three decades on, the grainy footage of Mackay&apos;s goal is only rarely spotted. Yet Australia&apos;s young coach Rale Rasic, who did so much to bond the team into their one-for-all mentality said the goal was a &quot;a moment you treasure for life&quot;. Full-back Doug Utjesenovic described the strike as a &quot;one in a million&quot;: a summation hard to argue against.  3) Australia 1-1 Israel (Sydney, April 1989) Though a draw would not suffice, optimism was high, partly as a result of a battling draw earned a month earlier at Tel Aviv&apos;s intimidating Ramat Gan, and partly due to the new phenomenon that was European-based Socceroos. Australia&apos;s forward line included Eddie Krncevic, David Mitchell and Frank Farina, all of whom had enjoyed success in Europe.  This match, however, was played against a rare backdrop, and proved to be poorly timed in more ways than one. It was the week of Adolf Hitler&apos;s 100th birthday but fears of crowd references to such proved unfounded. The match was also played less than 24 hours after the horrific events at Hillsborough. The &apos;house full&apos; sign went up shortly before kick-off, but despite the shocking news from the other side of the world, or perhaps because of it, officials decided to alleviate a crush outside the gates by throwing the doors open.  Israel&apos;s defence was marshalled by the late Avi Cohen, whose stint at Liverpool in the early 80s marked him as the first Israeli to play in England&apos;s top flight. Up front was Ronny Rosenthal \u2013 who himself would make the move to Anfield a year later \u2013 and Israeli football&apos;s poster boy Eli Ohana. And it was the latter, who boasts several Sydney-based relatives, who made the day&apos;s pivotal contribution. Israel were denied a seemingly clear penalty as Rosenthal went down under the challenge of goalkeeper Jeff Olver, while Farina had similar claims at the other end.  However, a tense and scrappy first half seemed set to end in parity only for Ohana to break the deadlock five minutes before the interval. Socceroos captain Charlie Yankos made a rare error of judgement which, combined with hesitation by defensive partner and current Newcastle Jets coach Gary van Egmond, allowed Ohana to pounce. The lank-haired Ohana coolly rounded Olver and, with calm bordering on insouciance, proceeded to dummy, almost unnecessarily, the retreating Van Egmond before slotting into an empty net.  Two goals in the second half was a massive challenge, and the Socceroos rarely threatened despite the attacking line-up. Substitute Paul Trimboli, the youngest member of the side, scored with a sharply-executed volley two minutes from time to preserve an unbeaten home World Cup qualifying record that was to stretch from 1981 to 2008. The visitors, however, had long taken much of the sting out of the game with a succession of delays. A lengthy period of injury time loomed, but idiosyncratic Italian referee Carlo Longhi decided he had seen enough and incredibly blew for full-time just seconds past 90 minutes. The Socceroos coach, Frank Arok, animated even by his standards, raced onto the pitch thrusting out his watch, and momentarily it seemed that anything could happen as a host of players surrounded the official. Eventually there was nothing to do other than accept the painful reality of another failed campaign. 4) Australia 1-1 Argentina (Sydney, October 1993)            Australia&apos;s path to the 1994 World Cup proved even more convoluted than usual. Dispensing with Oceania was just the first of three hurdles to negotiate. A resilient Canada were overcome, albeit only on penalties as a 21-year-old Mark Schwarzer was catapulted into the spotlight. The final challenge was a meeting with a South American side. The draw suggested that the opponent would likely be Colombia, Paraguay or Peru. Colombia, however, defied expectations by conjuring a landmark 5-0 win in Buenos Aires to send Argentina into the play-off. It was La Albiceleste&apos;s worst defeat in decades and the hand-wringing was immediate. Bowing to public pressure, coach Alfio Basile recalled Diego Maradona following his 15-month absence for taking banned substances, and then named him captain. For perhaps the first time ever, the gaze of the football world was well and truly on Australia. Surely Australia would be no match for the two-time world champions. Argentina&apos;s attack was led by Serie A duo Abel Balbo and the prolific Gabriel Batistuta, and made for a stark contrast with a backline featuring four players from the semi-professional ranks of the National Soccer League. The Argentine pair looked slick in possession but were largely starved of the ball by a hard-working Socceroo side that had long been well-drilled in the art of defending en masse by coach Eddie Thomson. Maradona showed several flashes of inspiration without quite being in vintage form. However Maradona, in one of the few times he escaped the man-marking of Australian skipper Paul Wade, set up Argentina&apos;s goal by delivering an inch-perfect cross converted with equal precision by the head of Balbo. It took just six minutes for scores to be level. Ned Zelic coolly dropped a pass onto the foot of onrushing right-back Tony Vidmar who swept the ball with telepathic accuracy onto the foot of brother Aurelio, who steered home the equaliser. It was the ultimate backyard dream realised.  The second half was delayed as the stadium lights went out which, combined with the actual half-time break, made for a lengthy interval. It was little surprise that the second period lacked the kind of fluency seen in the first, and it was a scenario that suited the visitors. An away score draw was surely enough for Argentina and so it proved, though only by a surprisingly slim margin. Australia, without the injured Zelic and Bosnich, were unwavering until the end in Buenos Aires, and it took a miracle Tommy Oar-esque deflection from Batistuta&apos;s cross off the shin of Alex Tobin to separate the teams. 5) Australia 2-2 Iran (Melbourne, November 1997) Australia&apos;s World Cup history had long been intertwined with heartbreaking failure, but there had never been a nadir like this. This was a storyline that played out like a dark inverted boys&apos; own tale. There was a sense that the increasing competitiveness of the Socceroos internationally, the know-how of a high-profile coach in Terry Venables and the increasing number of European-based players, meant that this was the time. There was also a world record 14 match winning run. Admittedly some of the results were against small fry, such as a ludicrous 13-0 rout of the Solomon Islands, which included goalkeeper Mark Bosnich scoring from the penalty spot. Counter-balancing the scale were victories over Norway, South Korea and perhaps, most notably, Hungary in Budapest; wins in Europe could then be counted on one hand. Aided by some remarkable saves from Bosnich, Australia had escaped Tehran&apos;s hugely intimidating Azadi stadium \u2013 and an estimated 128,000 home supporters - with a 1-1 draw. Backed by the support of a record Socceroos World Cup crowd of 85,000, the balance was now marginally tipped in the home team&apos;s favour. Inspired by wide-men Robbie Slater, and in particular Stan Lazaridis, Australia shredded Iran&apos;s defence on numerous occasions. It was left to Harry Kewell, at just 19 years of age to break the deadlock having scored his maiden international goal in Tehran a week earlier. Aurelio Vidmar doubled the lead three minutes after the interval and Australia seemed unstoppable while the visitors, who had barely conjured a single goal attempt, were dazed and in utter disarray.  But then came what many claim was the turning point. Peter Hore, for whom the phase &apos;Serial Pest&apos; seemed to have been coined, and a man who in previous weeks had interrupted the Melbourne Cup and funeral of Michael Hutchence, entered the field and hauled down the net in the wake of Vidmar&apos;s second goal. There was certainly a momentum shift, accentuated with the first goal for Iran tucked away by captain Karim Bagheri. Replays suggested Khodadad Azizi, who provided the final pass, was offside. Four minutes later Azizi broke the offside trap and slotted past the hopelessly exposed Bosnich. Scores were level but it was Iran that suddenly had one foot in France and with Australia&apos;s earlier fluency now dissipated, there was to be no way back. Johnny Warren, Australia&apos;s own self-styled football missionary, was literally unable to speak to a live national television audience as tears welled in his eyes. The entire Australian football fraternity was in pain and Johnny&apos;s tears spoke for all. Despite the nation&apos;s famed passion for sport, this was seen to be the chance for football \u2013 a game considered by middle Australia to be fractured and marked by ethnic differences \u2013 to cross the divide and make the jump from a subculture to the mainstream. As it turned out the sleeping giant, to use a Warren-ism, was far from awoken, merely roused.  6) Australia 1-0 Uruguay (Sydney, November 2005) Uruguay&apos;s attacking talisman Alvaro Recoba was quoted as saying the two-time winners had a &quot;divine right&quot; to be at the World Cup. For once though, in some of the tightest two matches of football one could wish to see, the bounce of the World Cup ball went Australia&apos;s way. Some was a result of good planning and execution, some a result of pure good luck.  Remarkably Uruguay found themselves in the play-off facing Australia, exactly as they had done four years earlier. With a 3-1 aggregate win taking them to Korea/Japan 2002, not to mention a stunning history of overachievement in the World Cup, Uruguay could be forgiven for being confident. However the Socceroos &apos;golden generation&apos; was now at the peak of their powers. Having been spat on and harassed at Montevideo airport in 2001, the Australian federation went into overdrive in the organisation stakes. They had months to prepare, while Uruguay had exactly four weeks. Incredibly, there was only four days between the two matches, effectively three and a half considering the time difference. Australia departed on a Qantas charter within hours of full time in the first leg, which Uruguay had won 1-0. Uruguay had to wait until the next morning and found that most business class seats were booked out.  Mark Bresciano scored the only goal on 35 minutes with a typically piercing strike amid a heightened atmosphere in Sydney. Australia though were still on a knife edge. An away goal for La Celeste would effectively end the tie. Recoba, perhaps spooked by some fierce attention from defenders and a baying crowd who had clearly read the pre-match press, was in and out of the game although his free-kicks were invariably menacing. Uruguay&apos;s lanky striker Richard Morales had the best chance of the match only to somehow direct his close-range header into the ground and over the crossbar. The two teams knew they were one defensive error away from catastrophe, and extra time came and went. For the first and only time in history, World Cup qualification was to be determined on penalties. Mark Schwarzer&apos;s first save was cancelled out after Mark Viduka dinked his effort wide, only for the Socceroo keeper to again come to the rescue and set up John Aloisi&apos;s momentous winner. Cue unprecedented delirium. Guus Hiddink was feted for his tactical nous, having rolled the dice and won with almost every decision. Yet it could have been so different. The veteran Dutchman was warming up Zeljko Kalac, who boasted a strong record of saves from the spot, with a view to introducing him in the dying minutes. However, an enforced substitution to a stricken Brett Emerton with 10 minutes remaining put paid to that notion. Virtually every member of the Class of 74 was in the stands, taking in an occasion that must have felt like it would never arrive. The absentees were few, but among them was reclusive skipper Peter Wilson, and tragically the late Jimmy Mackay, whose storied goal in Hong Kong 32 years earlier was his generation&apos;s Aloisi moment. The most poignant absence though was that of football missionary Johnny Warren who didn&apos;t live to see the sport&apos;s breakthrough moment. Warren&apos;s state funeral was held a year and a day prior to the second leg. Perhaps there was intervention from above after all.", "publicationDate": "2013-06-17T22:23:00Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: Crucial Socceroo World Cup qualifiers", "sentences": ["3) Australia 1-1 Israel (Sydney, April 1989) Though a draw would not suffice, optimism was high, partly as a result of a battling draw earned a month earlier at Tel Aviv&apos;s intimidating Ramat Gan, and partly due to the new phenomenon that was European-based Socceroos."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/17/joy-of-six-australia-world-cup-qualifiers"}, {"tags": ["ERT", "Media", "Television industry", "Radio industry", "Greece", "Europe", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "Efforts to keep Greek state TV alive after the government ordered it to be shut down were dealt a blow after a diplomatic intervention in Israel. The Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, requested the assistance of his ambassador in Tel Aviv after it emerged that one of the companies keeping ERT on air was owned by an Israeli firm. Defiant journalists occupying ERT studios in Athens and Thessaloniki have been able to keep an unbroken skeleton news service going since 11 June, when Samaras ordered its abrupt closure, thanks to the European Broadcasting Union which provided technical facilities to continue transmitting into Greek homes via three satellites. Officials in Athens confirmed that Greece&apos;s ambassador to Israel, Spyros Lambrinis, had held talks with the Israeli government after it became clear that RRsat, a privately-owned local company and subcontractor of the EBU, was continuing to transmit ERT via its uplink facilities in Greece. But the official stopped short of saying that he had urged the Israeli government to intervene. &quot;The ambassador handed the relevant authorities a letter from the finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, explaining the new situation in Greece and making it clear that the national economy ministry is now the &apos;successor entity&apos; to ERT,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;He made no demands as such but, yes, it is a rather unpleasant situation,&quot; added the official who contacted the ambassador before speaking to the Guardian. The EBU received a letter from the Greek finance minister warning of legal consequences to their action last week, despite international condemnation of the broadcaster&apos;s closure. It is understood that RRSat told the EBU in a letter it had decided to stop broadcasting ERT&apos;s signal after being approached directly by the Greek ambassador to Israel. Two of the satellites are continuing to broadcast the signal, meaning there is still some coverage in Greece alongside internet streaming. Journalists inside the occupied ERT building in Athens said staff continue to work for free, putting programmes out on air while hundreds of protestors maintain a vigil outside.

I&apos;ve always preferred his novels, in particular Comrade Jacob, a sympathetic account of Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers during the English revolution (Caute&apos;s history tutor at Oxford was Christopher Hill). In his new book, he has expanded a cold war footnote into an entire volume, but has performed a valuable service in doing so. The work is a portrait of Isaiah Berlin, with whom the author shared a perch at All Souls College, Oxford, where they engaged in\u00a0lofty conversations. One of the less\u00a0elevated talks concerned Isaac Deutscher, and troubled Caute. Berlin the liberal political philosopher and Deutscher the Marxist historian were both asylum seekers, given refuge and residence in Britain during the early decades of the last century. That\u00a0was about all they had in common. Their intellectual trajectories pointed in opposite directions. Berlin was escaping the Russian revolution, Deutscher was fleeing from the armies of the Third Reich, poised to take Poland. Both were Jews: the first was\u00a0a\u00a0Zionist, who annoyed Chaim Weizmann by refusing all his requests to move to Tel Aviv and become an adviser; the second famously defined himself as a &quot;non-Jewish Jew&quot;, and\u00a0despite arguing with David Ben-Gurion, remained sympathetic to Israel \u2013 until the 1967 war. Deutscher&apos;s next of\u00a0kin had perished in the camps. His surviving relations lived in Israel. He\u00a0died in 1967 aged 60, and his last\u00a0interview in the New Left Review took the form of a prescient warning to\u00a0Israel, comparing its intransigence to that of old Prussia: &quot;To justify or condone Israel&apos;s wars against the Arabs is to render Israel a very bad service indeed and harm its own long-term interest \u2026 The Germans have summed up their own experience in the bitter phrase: &apos;Man kann sich totsiegen!&apos; &apos;You\u00a0can triumph yourself to death&apos;.&quot; Berlin became an influential figure in British and American public life. His\u00a0packed early morning lectures at Oxford on Marx were bracing. He was a\u00a0witty raconteur, intelligent and not averse to replying to hostile questions. His speaking style was confected, a parody of an upper-class English voice replete with stutter and a disjointed laugh. Even his loyal biographer, Michael Ignatieff, was compelled to\u00a0remark on his over-the-top Anglophilia. Berlin was a liberal fanatic, a\u00a0staunch empire loyalist, gliding effortlessly from Britain to the US when the time came. He was at his happiest when close to power, an instinctive courtier, unless insulted or\u00a0ignored. During the 1970s he was invited to Iran, then under the Shah, when dissidents were being hanged naked or toasted on racks by the hated secret police. He accepted. His fee was never disclosed, but the subject of his talk, &quot;On the Rise of Cultural Pluralism&quot;, irritated the empress Farah Pahlavi. He was barely halfway through when the empress signalled a factotum to bring her torture to an end and stop the lecture. Berlin later confided to a friend that it was as if he had been &quot;stung by several wasps&quot;. But why had he gone in the first\u00a0place? Berlin has been much written about. Ignatieff&apos;s 1998 biography was itself the subject of a savage assault by Christopher Hitchens, one of the finest essays he ever wrote, identifying all that Ignatieff had left out. This included justifications of the 1965 massacre of more than a million Communists and other leftists in Indonesia; as well as the horrors of the\u00a0Vietnam war, a conflict planned and carried through by the liberal technocrats of the Democratic party whom Berlin adored. Deutscher has yet to find a biographer. Deeply hostile to American imperialism, he was never uncritical of the Soviet Union and, as a\u00a0consequence, was often slandered in\u00a0the Stalinist press. He had a visceral dislike of former Marxists who supposedly saw the light and became cold-war pawns, subsidised by the CIA via the Congress for Cultural Freedom \u2013 the magazine Encounter was a particular bete noire. Forced to live off\u00a0freelance earnings writing for the Economist and the Observer, Deutscher sometimes cut corners to meet a deadline, but the prose was always meticulous. His three-volume Trotsky biography\u00a0is beautifully written. Deutscher had to write continuously to earn money and that is one reason why he wanted the stability of an academic post. He was offered one by the University of Sussex, but as I wrote at the time in the Black Dwarf, Berlin blackballed him \u2013 Caute writes that he consistently denied the accusation. Caute&apos;s excavation of the archives leaves no doubt whatsoever that Berlin lied. When the vice-chancellor of Sussex consulted him on Deutscher, Berlin let the guillotine drop without any hesitation: &quot;The candidate of whom you speak is the only man whose presence in the same academic community as myself I should find morally intolerable.&quot; But he wanted to\u00a0be helpful: he would not object to Eric Hobsbawm or C Wright Mills. End\u00a0of story. Why did he react so strongly? It was not just the politics. Caute suggests, plausibly, that the reason for the bile was personal. Behind the mask and despite the self\u2011denigration, Berlin was insecure and vain. His first book, Historical Inevitability, was reviewed negatively by Deutscher in the Observer. The\u00a0insult would never be forgiven. Caute&apos;s account of Berlin&apos;s earlier vendetta against Hannah Arendt is an eye-opener. Together with Einstein\u00a0and other prominent Jewish intellectuals, Arendt had criticised Israel for its encouragement of &quot;fascist&quot;-style nationalists who had carried out massacres in Deir Yassin and elsewhere. Berlin was a loyal Zionist from afar; Arendt was anything but. Besides, she was never impressed by his intellect and may well have made this clear at some private gathering. When consulted by Faber &amp; Faber as to whether they should publish The Human Condition, her book on political theory, Berlin responded: &quot;I\u00a0could recommend no publisher to buy the UK rights of this book. There are\u00a0two objections to it: it will not sell and it is no good.&quot; The book was never published in the UK.

Working with a relatively tight budget, he took Brighton to the Championship play-offs, where they lost to Crystal Palace in the semi-finals and, afterwards, he displayed his frustration when he wondered whether he had taken the club as far as he could. It is clear, however, that his breakdown with Bloom has been total. Brighton are ready to turn to Garc\u00eda, the 40-year-old Spaniard, who played for Barcelona and coached their youth team for two seasons.

Within days this had become a nationwide movement whose concerns had spread far beyond fares: more than a million people were on the streets shouting about everything from corruption to the cost of living to the amount of money being spent on the World Cup. In Turkey, it was a similar story. A protest over the future of a city park in Istanbul \u2013 violently disrupted by police \u2013 snowballed too into something bigger, a wider-ranging political confrontation with prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which has scarcely been brought to a close by last weekend&apos;s clearing of Gezi Park. If the recent scenes have seemed familiar, it is because they shared common features: viral, loosely organised with fractured messages and mostly taking place in urban public locations. Unlike the protest movement of 1968 or even the end of Soviet influence in eastern Europe in 1989, these are movements with few discernible leaders and often conflicting ideologies. Their points of reference are not even necessarily ideological but take inspiration from other protests, including those of the Arab spring and the Occupy movement. The result has seen a wave of social movements \u2013 sometimes short-lived \u2013 from Wall Street to Tel Aviv and from Istanbul to Rio de Janeiro, often engaging younger, better educated and wealthier members of society. What is striking for those who, like myself, have covered these protests is often how discursive and open-ended they are. People go not necessarily to hear a message but to take over a location and discuss their discontents (even if the stunning consequence can be the fall of an autocratic leader such as Egypt&apos;s Hosni Mubarak).     Demonstration against the demolition of Gezi Park in Istanbul. Photograph: Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images    If the &quot;new protest&quot; can be summed up, it is not in specifics of the complaints but in a wider idea about organisation encapsulated on a banner spotted in Brazil last week: &quot;We are the social network.&quot; In Brazil the varied banners underlined the difficulty of easy categorisation as protesters held aloft signs expressing a range of demands from education reforms to free bus fares while denouncing the billions of public dollars spent on stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics two years later. &quot;It&apos;s sort of a Catch-22,&quot; Rodrigues da Cunha, a 63-year-old protester told the Associated Press. &quot;On the one hand we need some sort of leadership, on the other we don&apos;t want this to be compromised by being affiliated with any political party.&quot; As the Economist pointed out last week, while mass movements in Britain, France, Sweden and Turkey have been inspired by a variety of causes, including falling living standards, authoritarian government and worries about immigration, Brazil does not fit the picture, with youth unemployment at a record low and enjoying the biggest leap in living standards in the country&apos;s history. So what&apos;s going on? An examination of the global Edelman Trust Barometer reveals a loose correlation between the ranking of a country on the trust scale and the likelihood of protests. The trust barometer is a measure of public confidence in institutions compiled by the US firm Edelman, the world&apos;s largest privately owned PR company. In 2011, at the time the Occupy movement was being born in Zuccoti Park on Wall Street, the UK and the US were both firmly placed at the bottom of the &quot;distrusters&quot; while Brazil topped the &quot;trusters&quot;. By this year Brazil had dropped 30 points on the table, while Spain and Turkey, which have both seen protests this year, were both in the distrusted category. Paul Mason, economics editor of BBC2&apos;s Newsnight and author of Why It&apos;s Kicking Off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions, has argued that a key factor, largely driven by new communication technologies, is that people have not only a better understanding of power but are more aware of its abuse, both economically and politically. Mason believes we are in the midst of a &quot;revolution caused by the near collapse of free-market capitalism combined with an upswing in technical innovation&quot; \u2013 but not everyone is so convinced.     Protesters in Tel Aviv in September 2011. Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images    What does ring true, however, is his assertion that a driving force from Tahrir Square to Occupy is a redefinition of notions of both what &quot;freedom&quot; means and its relationship to governments that seem ever more distant. It is significant, too, that many recent protests have taken place in the large cities that have been most transformed by neoliberal policies. Tali Hatuka, an Israeli urban geographer, whose book on the new forms of protest will be published next year, identifies the mass mobilisations against the Iraq war in 2003 as a turning point in how people protest. Hatuka argues that, while previous large public protests had tended to be focused and narrow in their organisation, the Iraq war protests saw demonstrations in 800 cities globally which encompassed and tolerated a wide variety of outlooks. &quot;Most recently,&quot; Hatuka wrote in the journal Geopolitics last year, &quot;this spirit has characterised the Arab spring and New York&apos;s Occupy Wall Street, which were protests based on informal leadership and a multitude of voices.&quot; &quot;Up to the 1990s,&quot; she said last week, &quot;protests tended to be organised around a pyramid structure with a centralised leadership. As much effort went into the planning as into the protest itself. And the [impact on the] day after the protest was as significant as the event itself. Now protest is organised more like a network. It is far more informal, the event itself often being immediate.&quot; Hatuka cautions against generalising too much \u2013 distinguishing between the events of the Arab spring, where mass protests were able to remove regimes, and protests in western democracies. But she does point to how the new form of protest tends to produce fractured and temporary alliances. &quot;If you compare what we are seeing today with the civil rights movement in the US \u2013 even the movements of 1989 \u2013 those were much more cohesive. Now the event itself is the message. The question is whether that is enough.&quot; She suspects it is not, pointing to how present-day activism \u2013 from the Iraq war demonstrations onwards \u2013 has often failed to deliver concrete results with its impact often fizzling out. Because of this, current forms of protest may be a temporary phenomenon and may be forced to change.     Tens of thousands of Egyptians take part in a rally in Tahrir Square in 2011. Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images    Another key feature of the new protests, argues Saskia Sassen, a sociology professor at Columbia University, New York, is the notion of &quot;occupation&quot; \u2013 which has not been confined to the obvious tactics of the Occupy movement. Occupations of different kinds have occurred in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in Gezi Park, Istanbul, and during widespread social protests in Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, in 2011. &quot;Occupying is not the same as demonstrating. Many of the [recent] protests made legible the fact that occupying makes novel territory, and thereby a bit of history, using what was previously considered merely ground,&quot; Sassen wrote recently. &quot;Whether in Egypt, the US, or elsewhere, it is important that the aim of the occupiers is not to grab power. They were and are, rather, engaged in the work of citizenship, exposing deep flaws and wrongs in their polity and society. &quot;This is a very peculiar moment,&quot; Sassen told the Observer. &quot;This form of protest is very amorphous in comparison with the movements that came before.&quot; She argues that one distinguishing factor is that many of the protest movements of the past decade have been defined by the involvement of what she calls &quot;the modest middle class&quot;, who have often been beneficiaries of the systems they are protesting against but whose positions have been eroded by neoliberal economic policies that have seen both distribution of wealth and opportunities captured by a narrowing minority. As people have come to feel more distant from government and economic institutions, a large part of the new mass forms of dissent has come to be seen as an opportunity to demonstrate ideas of &quot;citizenship&quot;. &quot;Often what people are saying is that you are the state. I&apos;m a citizen. I&apos;ve done my job. You&apos;re not recognising that.&quot; Sassen&apos;s belief that many of the recent protests are middle-class-driven appeared to be confirmed overtly \u2013 in the case of Brazil, at least \u2013 by President Dilma Rousseff, when she acknowledged that the new middle classes &quot;want more and have the right to more&quot;. For an older generation of political theorists, as Sassen admits, not least those from a Marxist background, the current trends have sometimes been puzzling. &quot;I remember talking to [British Marxist historian] Eric Hobsbawm \u2013 a dear friend. He asked me: &apos;What&apos;s up [with Occupy]?&apos; I said it is a very interesting movement. But his reply was: &apos;If there is no party, then there&apos;s no future.&apos;&quot; Indeed, it was precisely this concern two years ago that led Malcolm Gladwell \u2013 in a controversial essay for the New Yorker, Small change: why the revolution will not be tweeted \u2013 to ask a similar question: whether networks of activists modelled on social media and with &quot;weak tie-ins&quot; can sustain themselves in the long run. &quot;The old pyramid way of organising protests does have its limitations, but so too do the new ways of organising,&quot; says Hatuka. &quot;Often it does not feel very effective in the long run. People will often go for a day or two and these protests are not necessarily offering an ideological alternative.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-22T21:00:03Z", "title": "Global protest grows as citizens lose faith in politics and the state", "sentences": ["The result has seen a wave of social movements \u2013 sometimes short-lived \u2013 from Wall Street to Tel Aviv and from Istanbul to Rio de Janeiro, often engaging younger, better educated and wealthier members of society.", "Protesters in Tel Aviv in September 2011.", "Occupations of different kinds have occurred in Tahrir Square, Cairo, in Gezi Park, Istanbul, and during widespread social protests in Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, in 2011."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/urban-protest-changing-global-social-network"}, {"tags": ["World news"], "article": "BTL (below the line) is a weekly profile of a particularly delightful, prolific or controversial member of the Guardian comment community.

Poyet, who was working on BBC&apos;s Match of the Day coverage of the Confederations Cup, appeared to be taken aback when informed by a member of the broadcaster&apos;s production team while on air on Sunday evening that his stint in charge club, which began in November 2009, had been curtailed.

In a little over two weeks, Israel&apos;s supreme court will hear an appeal on behalf of the villagers against the planned evacuation of eight communities in the South Hebron Hills. If the 13-year legal battle over Firing Zone 918 ends in Israel&apos;s favour, the bleat of goats will be replaced by the crack of assault rifles and the villagers will be moved into a nearby town. The Israeli government&apos;s position is that, as a military training zone including live fire, the area is not a suitable environment for permanent residence. In the past week, support for the villagers has come from an unexpected source: 25 of Israel&apos;s best-known authors signed a petition calling for the communities to be saved. Written by the internationally acclaimed novelist David Grossman, the appeal&apos;s signatories include Amos Oz, AB Yehoshua, Meir Shalev and Sayed Kashua. &quot;For the past 20 years, Israel has been actively expelling and displacing the inhabitants of the South Hebron Hills villages,&quot; it says. &quot;These villagers have always practised a unique lifestyle: most of them are cave-dwellers and find their livelihood in sheep and goat-herding and small crop farming. Over these years, they have suffered unceasing harassment by the Israeli army and settlers ... They live in constant fear, helplessly facing a ruthless power that does everything to displace them from the home they have inhabited for centuries.&quot; It goes on: &quot;In a reality of ongoing occupation, of solid cynicism and meanness, each and every one of us bears the moral obligation to try to relieve the suffering, do something to bend back the occupation&apos;s giant, cruel hand.&quot;     Credit: Observer graphics    The area of 12 square miles was designated a military training zone by Israel in the 1980s, but it was not until 1999 that action was taken to clear the land of its inhabitants. The villagers were forcibly evicted, all structures were demolished and inhabited caves were filled with rubble and blocked up. But a court injunction allowed some villagers to return pending a decision on a legal challenge to the evictions. The case was frozen from 2005 until last year, leaving the threat of forced removal and demolitions. It is a remote and undeveloped landscape, rolling towards the Negev desert. Tarpaulin tents and breeze-block shelters are scattered over the dry, stony hills. There are almost no paved roads, and none of the villages is connected to a water supply or the electricity grid. Families depend on a few solar power panels donated by European governments and aid groups, rare rainwater and expensive water supplies brought in by tractor from the nearest town. During the long, arid, summer months, families spend almost half their income on water for themselves and their livestock. Meanwhile, hardline Israeli settler outposts on the edge of Firing Zone 918 are hooked up to water and power, served by paved roads and protected by the Israeli army. The Palestinian villagers and their livestock are subject to frequent intimidation and violent beatings by the radical settlers; tyres have been slashed. For several years, village children have been given a court-ordered army escort on their walk to school following abuse and stone-throwing by settlers. &quot;This is a group of poor and miserable people who are being constantly harassed and attacked \u2013 and my country&apos;s army is obeying the command of the settlers in this area,&quot; Meir Shalev, an award-winning novelist and one of the signatories to the authors&apos; petition, told the Observer. &quot;These people are being driven away, and if you have some kind of heart it&apos;s something you should protest against.&quot; The villagers&apos; Israeli lawyers say the land&apos;s ownership is not in question. &quot;I have three huge files of land ownership in this area. It&apos;s not disputed that this is privately-owned land,&quot; said Shlomo Lecker. The Israeli state attorney told the supreme court last year that the land was needed for military training, and that the villagers&apos; permanent residence was incompatible with exercises involving live fire. But critics say that the context of Firing Zone 918 is the Israeli government&apos;s desire to clear &quot;Area C&quot; \u2013 the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control \u2013 of Palestinians by moving residents into towns in &quot;Area A&quot;, the 18% of the West Bank under full Palestinian Authority control. Under international humanitarian law, the transfer of occupied populations is forbidden unless it is temporary and in the context of active hostilities. Mahmoud Hamamdeh, the chief of Mufaqara village, which faces multiple demolition orders, said the communities lived in &quot;dignity and honour&quot; until &quot;the cancer of settlements began&quot;. Using the Arabic word for steadfast perseverance, he added: &quot;Israel may destroy our cement, but it will never destroy our sumud.&quot; Shalev said he hoped the authors&apos; petition would awaken the Israeli public to the Palestinian villagers&apos; plight, but was doubtful of its impact. &quot;Israeli society has become deaf and blind to the moral aspects of the occupation.

She was killed on cycle superhighway 2 in east London, near Aldgate East station, on Saturday evening. Of course, it is no surprise; nothing significant has changed since the last cyclist was killed in a collision with a lorry, or the one before that, or the one before that. While this sad situation will provide another occasion for all the usual arguments and opinions to be wheeled out once again for and against cyclists on the road, much more important are the unvoiced views of a larger segment of the population; casual cyclists who may lose faith in both the hire scheme and the superhighways. With the cycle hire scheme as popular as it has proved to be, it was only a matter of time before a fatality occurred. With thousands of potentially inexperienced cyclists on the roads every day, it is essential to make those roads as safe as possible to reduce the likelihood of this happening again. It is unrealistic and unfair to put the onus on cyclists to be solely responsible for their own safety in these situations while simultaneously encouraging less confident riders to get on bikes and explore the city. The danger posed to cyclists by lorries on busy streets is a widely acknowledged and easy to mitigate problem that continues to kill on an all too regular basis. Lorries are involved in about 50% of cyclist deaths in London, and any plan to increase the take up of cycling needs to make addressing this issue a top priority. While no trivial matter, it will be much easier to make legislative changes here than to properly address infrastructure concerns, which although necessary will take time. The companies that own lorries have a duty of care not just to other road users but also to the drivers they employ. While it would be unwise to make any claims about this particular incident before more details are available (although it should be noted that the driver stopped and has not been arrested), it is possible that if the cyclist was in the vehicle&apos;s blind spot there may have been very little the driver could have done to avert the incident. The technology to eliminate blind spots is widely and cheaply available; unfortunately it seems that more cyclists must die before there is the political will to make the use of these innovations compulsory. As cycling becomes more popular across the UK, it is not good enough to rely on the quick wits of experienced cyclists as our only safety measure. To reap the benefits of increased bike use we must remove the psychological barriers to taking up cycling, and this is a major one. Roads should be safe for cyclists of all abilities, from experienced daily commuters to tourists on their first ride through the city. The fact that the collision occurred on a cycle superhighway reminds us of the lack of serious planning for cycling infrastructure in London. Whether you prefer working towards segregated routes or safer shared roads, the glorified bike lanes are a sorry compromise which many drivers have very little respect for. While the quieter stretches are often well marked and away from traffic, at busy intersections such as the one where the accident occurred they can do little more than confer a false sense of security on their users. This junction is one of many in London where it is much more important to be alert to what&apos;s going on around you than it is to be following a blue line on the road. While they are apparently designed to facilitate &quot;safer, faster and more direct journeys into the city&quot;, to suggest that being on a superhighway at this junction gives you even the most minimal protection from other traffic is patently ludicrous. According to a Metropolitan police spokesperson, the cyclist was not wearing a helmet. While wearing one would have been unlikely to have saved her in a collision with a HGV, the fact remains that the cycle hire scheme reduces the percentage of helmeted cyclists on the roads. We can expect more fatalities in the future from interactions between cycle hire bikes and vehicles other than lorries, against which helmets offer little protection. As has been proved by the repeated failure of cycle hire schemes in cities with compulsory helmet use such as Melbourne and Brisbane these laws are inimical to uptake of public bike share facilities. Tel Aviv&apos;s Telofun scheme only took off once helmet laws were effectively repealed for urban riders, an example followed by Mexico City in the run-up to the launch of its Ecobici scheme. If we are to have lorries on our streets, and we must, they need to be adapted to take into account the other users of the city, including the casual cyclists who use the cycle hire scheme. We have had enough wake-up calls, and our sluggish response is beginning to look like ambivalence. The infrastructure debate will roll on, with big promises and inadequate funding commitments.

You can&apos;t get any work finished in the daytime, you can&apos;t sleep at night, and feeling hot and sticky between your thighs has little to do with sex, as you toss and turn in bed, about as comfortable as Charles Saatchi&apos;s PR adviser. In fact your most rampant desire involving the person lying next to you is for them to get up, go to the kitchen and swap your pillowcase for one they&apos;ve secretly been stashing in the fridge-freezer. Going to bed naked, something you longed for during the 100-year pyjama wars, makes you feel less like a sultry Latin lover and more like a Pritt Stick. Even your dog, initially so thrilled about the whole outdoors skipping-like-a-mental-thing, is reduced to panting in the manner of a born-again asthmatic. And yet, and yet. That feeling of night-time heat can be so powerful when it first seizes you. As a pale white kid from Yorkshire, I remember the first time I found out that darkness could also be hot. I was five, on holiday in Sicily, and I opened the car door after a long drive, only to be met with a blast of heat. It was night outside, therefore it should have been cold, but it felt like being violently assaulted by a soft flannel. Mount Etna had erupted nearby and I didn&apos;t know this heat was normal in other countries \u2013 I grew quietly excited, as we picked up bits of cooled lava that had reached the road, that the volcano was coming for us. Years later, something of that feeling returned to me on a journalism trip to Tel Aviv. Sitting outside a street cafe at midnight; a hot, dark, Middle Eastern midnight, beside stalls selling fresh pomegranate juice, the smell of jasmine, the bodyguards with guns. Everyone stopped to stare as a cloud of bats swarmed down the street, a hot black flutter swooping past the overhead tangle of telegraph wires; the vivid, whooshing noise as they passed. My friend Amy, who lives on Orkney, goes out bird-watching and taking photos on the island after dark, sometimes in the early hours. The sky is streaked with the world&apos;s highest type of cloud, visible only in summer after the sun has set. These clouds, which glow in the dark with a blue-white light, are apparently called noctilucent \u2013 the Latin for &quot;night shining&quot;. They look like static interference pulled into threads. Like sinewy ghosts. Amy says a herd of\u00a0black cows charged towards her when\u00a0she was out looking at the night shinings last night. Here in London, the buildings are so much closer together, the air is less fresh and you have to resign yourself to the fact that everyone else has had a toke on it before it gets passed to you. There are no stampeding cows, only stampeding drunks falling out of public houses, sent slightly delirious by the heady combination of 30\u00b0C sun and lilting Belgian lagers. I used to enjoy the odd guilty laugh at a blog called Goths in Hot Weather, which showcased photographs of people wearing layers of purple velvet, black lace and studded dog collars on sunny days. Until I heard myself complaining this morning that I didn&apos;t know how to dress in the sun, that I didn&apos;t know where to put all these long hot limbs. I started to wonder if my slightly awkward collection of thin, floppy garments couldn&apos;t at least be given some kind of structure. Maybe I should just put some makeup on after all. Some nice thick black eyeliner. And a crucifix. And three layers of ripped fishnet tights. Oh, it&apos;s time to come clean and admit it \u2013 they had the right idea all along. We are all goths in hot weather now.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-10T07:00:06Z", "title": "This sunny weather is a reminder of the stifling heat of the night | Sophie Heawood", "sentences": ["Years later, something of that feeling returned to me on a journalism trip to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/10/sunny-weather-heat-night"}, {"tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability"], "article": "The technocrats of Masdar could hardly be accused of a lack of ambition. The five-year-old Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, which aims to be the world&apos;s first zero-carbon city, aspires also to be a global centre of excellence for innovative clean-tech water companies. &quot;Masdar can be the Silicon Valley of water,&quot; says Mohammed El Ramahi, Masdar&apos;s head of utilities and asset management. He is certain that this part of the Middle East can be to water what California is to the microchip. With predictions that the water tech industry \u2013 covering desalination, purification, recycling, rainwater collection and hydro-electricity \u2013 will be worth $1tn by 2020, it is perhaps no surprise that Abu Dhabi wants in on the action. Revolutionary technology Finding an affordable desalination technology to transform the planet&apos;s vast supplies of unusable, salty water for consumption and re-use by people and industry is the modern alchemist&apos;s dream. But El Ramahi is confident that Masdar could be the birthplace for such a revolutionary technology. &quot;It will create desalination solutions which are completely viable and capable to be utilised in less fortunate communities,&quot; he says. Masdar is not alone, however. There is competition all around the world, including major clusters in the US, such as Ohio, Massachusetts, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and California; Ontario and British Columbia in Canada; and Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands. &quot;The prize is an enormous economic engine that [will] create jobs \u2013 expensive jobs,&quot; says Laura Shenkar, principal of Artemis Water Strategy, a consultancy based in San Francisco. Shenkar organises The Artemis Project Top 50, an annual ranking of the most promising water tech companies. The United States claimed top spot in 2012, being home to 29 of the top 50. Five came from Canada, five from Israel, four from Australia and three from Singapore. It would be wrong, however, to write off the other territories. Singapore, for instance, despite claiming just three top 50 companies, is home to a cluster of more than 100, as well as 25 research centres. With the right ingredients, Shenkar says \u2013 venture capital, academic institutions and fierce competition \u2013 a jurisdiction will attract emerging tech companies and lay an &quot;egg for economic growth&quot;. Long-term investment According to Ian Elkins, editor of Global Water Intelligence, a news and information service, the biggest challenge facing any new water technology, no matter how brilliant it may be on paper, is the time it takes to get a technology to market. Finding a jurisdiction where the local water utility company is open-minded about providing a test bed for new technologies is therefore incredibly important for emerging companies. &quot;Unlike the telecommunications or IT sectors, where take-up of new technologies is virtually instantaneous, it generally takes at least seven years for any new water technology to gain serious traction. During that time it will need sustained funding to keep it going through to commercialisation,&quot; Elkins says. &quot;Supportive local utilities such as Mekorot in Israel and PUB in Singapore can make the difference by providing testing and validation opportunities within the context of a working utility. The resulting performance data can then be used to support the commercialisation of the technology,&quot; he adds. Innovation by necessity North America may have topped out in the Artemis Top 50, but John Carr, general manager of water and mining at Clean TeQ, an Artemis Top 50 firm based in Melbourne, Australia, specialising in ion exchange and membrane processes, contends that those jurisdictions facing serious water scarcity issues may, in the long term, have the edge. &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention, so areas where water availability is low tends to lead to the highest level of innovation,&quot; Carr says. For such reasons, Australia should be watched closely, he suggests. &quot;Australia ticks all the boxes for an innovation hub for water technology. It has an advanced R&amp;D base with its universities and institutions, strong government support, several large industries with high water demand and water availability which ranges from scarce to drought,&quot; he adds. In the same vein, the rain-starved Middle East could well become home to several powerful water tech industries. Israel is one country in the region playing host to a successful cluster. The state recycles around 85% of waste water and its 300 or so water companies, specialising in desalination, waste water and irrigation technologies, earn it more than $2bn annually in exports. &quot;Slowly, large parts of the world [are] understanding what Israel had to understand 60 years ago,&quot; says Gilad Peled, director of agro-technology, water and environment at the Israeli Export Institute, adding that revenue has &quot;increased by 300% in the last five years&quot;. &quot;To understand what makes Israel a centre for excellence for water technologies you have to go back in history and understand the geography of the country \u2013 Israel is a small country with small resources of sweet water and a fast growing population,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not only the technologies that attracts global interests but the different way of thinking.&quot; Water ambition Peled and his team are gearing up for WATEC 2013 in Tel Aviv in October, a conference designed to showcase its expertise in the water tech sector. The last event in 2011 attracted 20,000 participants, including 5,000 from overseas. Peled hopes Israel will one day be seen as &quot;the Silicon Valley of water&quot;. &quot;We at the Israeli Export Institute will continue to do everything to reach this dream.&quot; Meanwhile, Masdar is similarly ambitious. Where will the nascent city&apos;s water tech industry be in 10 years&apos; time? &quot;On the moon \u2013 if not higher,&quot; replies a supremely confident El Ramahi. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2013 to reflect that Masdar City is five years old and not seven as originally written.

Now the Israeli band Orphaned Land is joining forces with the Palestinian group Khalas to take a message of coexistence through rock&apos;n&apos;roll across Europe. An 18-gig tour will see the bands perform in six countries, including Britain, this autumn. The musicians will share both a stage and a tour bus for three weeks, proving in practice that their &quot;metal brotherhood&quot; overrides differences of religion and national identity. At a concert to launch their European tour in Tel Aviv last week, Orphaned Land&apos;s lead singer, Kobi Farhi, and Khalas&apos;s lead guitarist, Abed Hathut, explained their mission. &quot;We can&apos;t change the world, but we can give an example of how coexistence is possible,&quot; said Farhi. &quot;Sharing a stage and sharing a bus is stronger than a thousand words. We&apos;ll show how two people from different backgrounds who live in a conflict zone can perform together.&quot; &quot;We are metal brothers before everything,&quot; said Hathut. But, he added, &quot;there is no bigger message for peace than through this tour&quot;. Coexistence ventures may be new in the world of heavy metal, but precedent was set in the high-brow realm of classical music more than two decades ago, when Jewish conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim and Palestinian intellectual Edward Said co-founded an orchestra of young Israeli, Palestinian and Arab musicians. The members of Khalas, which is the supporting act on the tour, and Orphaned Land have &quot;become soulmates&quot; since meeting at a radio station and realising they have more in common than divided them, said Farhi. Last week&apos;s gig was their second performance together. But joint ventures between Jewish and Arab artists in Israel have in the past met with boycott calls from Palestinian activists, who argue that coexistence projects sanitise discrimination against Israel&apos;s 1.5 million Arab citizens and the state&apos;s military occupation of the Palestinian territories. &quot;I&apos;m strongly against boycotts of any kind,&quot; said Farhi. &quot;The purpose of art is to represent harmony in places of disharmony, to bring hope.&quot; Hathut, from Acre in northern Israel, said Khalas \u2013 which means &quot;enough&quot; in Arabic \u2013 was a Palestinian band. &quot;Just because we are Palestinians, people expect us to sing only about the occupation.&quot; Orphaned Land, however, is overtly political. &quot;Our music is never about an ex-girlfriend, it&apos;s always about politics,&quot; said Farhi. The lyrics to one of the band&apos;s most popular numbers, Disciples of the Sacred Oath, includes the line: &quot;Shall we see the end of war, blood brothers? Or shall we fill another grave, for ourselves we couldn&apos;t save.&quot; The heavy metal brothers hope this autumn&apos;s tour is just the start. &quot;One day our children will form a band together,&quot; said Farhi.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-21T15:32:35Z", "title": "Israeli and Palestinian bands unite in 'metal brotherhood'", "sentences": ["At a concert to launch their European tour in Tel Aviv last week, Orphaned Land&apos;s lead singer, Kobi Farhi, and Khalas&apos;s lead guitarist, Abed Hathut, explained their mission."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/21/israeli-palestinian-bands-unite-tour"}, {"tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Documentary", "Animation"], "article": "When Uri Geller was a kid, living at his mum&apos;s B&amp;B in Cyprus, he made friends with a guest named Yoav. Uri told Yoav he could read his mind and knew Yoav was an Israeli spy. Yoav said that when Uri grew up he must join the Israeli army, the paratroopers, then officer school, and from there go on to the Mossad. His life was mapped out. Whoa, hang on. Uri&apos;s a cutlery-wrecking television magician and was Michael Jackson&apos;s mate when Michael was around to have mates, right? Yeah, he&apos;s not just that, though. Not according to The Secret Life of Uri Geller (BBC2, Sunday). Once, during the six-day war, a Jordanian soldier jumped out from behind a rock, he and Uri looked into each other&apos;s eyes, Uri&apos;s life flashed before him. And then he shot the Jordanian, dead. Oh! Couldn&apos;t he have just bent the barrel of the other guy&apos;s gun round? Anyway, from that moment on Uri realised his true love for Israel, and his calling to help, using his paranormal powers. He began to collect influential friends, like Benjamin Netanyahu (Jacko came later). And he went to a secret place outside Tel Aviv, with barbed wire and camels everywhere (which tells you just how secret it was), and he started doing stuff for the Mossad, though he can&apos;t say exactly what; it&apos;s too secret obviously. Don&apos;t forget there were camels, everywhere; that&apos;s how secret it was. Then the Americans got interested too, because this was the cold war, and they were worried that the Soviet psychics were getting ahead in the spoon-bending race. So one of the heads of the CIA (probably) summoned Uri to America, where he did a lot of work at the Stanford Research Institute, into remote viewing, quantum entanglement, stuff like that; though at that stage the CIA didn&apos;t totally trust him; they thought he might be a double agent. From there to Mexico, where Uri spied on the Russians, sat behind them on planes, erasing their floppy discs, using just the power of his mind, naturally. What about the raid on Entebbe though? Uri can&apos;t talk about Entebbe. Is is true he played a pivotal role in the audacious operation to rescue the hostages, took out the radar over the whole of North Africa so that the Israeli Defence Forces could fly in at night? He&apos;s not saying. Put it this way, though: he&apos;s certainly not saying he didn&apos;t do it. Jesus, I&apos;m beginning to wonder what major counter-terrorism operations Uri Geller hasn&apos;t been involved in over the years. I&apos;m assuming he was behind the killing of Bin Laden. Mogadishu didn&apos;t go so well though, did it Uri? Yeah, I know what you&apos;re going to say: Paul Daniels was in charge\u00a0of that one. There&apos;s a nice deadpan, non-judgemental tone to this film. Vikram Jayanti, who made it, pretty much leaves it up to you what to believe. It&apos;s tricky one. Here are these\u00a0people who seem legit saying they did this and that work with Uri into remote viewing (seeing things you\u00a0can&apos;t see, I think, like where missing people are) etc. But a lot of it \u2013 the stuff Uri won&apos;t talk about but clearly wants us to believe \u2013 is clearly bonkers. And isn&apos;t it a bit suspicious that an international spy \u2013 psychic spy, whatever the hell it is he thinks he is \u2013 is so keen to talk, even if it&apos;s mainly to say he can&apos;t. Be quiet, and do\u00a0something useful, like find Madeleine McCann. He does looks good, for 66, no? Maybe he&apos;s done to time what he should have done to that Jordanian&apos;s gun barrel: bent it back on itself. Now\u00a0that would be a useful skill; he could go back to 1972 and undo the Munich massacre. A new series of Family Guy (BBC3, Sunday) is a cause for celebration, and\u00a0what a joyous opener. So jam-packed with lols I enjoyed it as much the second time. After a disastrous evening at the high-achieving Fishmans, the Griffins decide they too, like the Fishmans, will climb Mount Everest. In Nepal, so-called, because the mountains look\u00a0like nipples. (It&apos;s actually a much better joke than that, with Jesus telling\u00a0God you can&apos;t just call a country Nipple, so God moves the stress to the last syllable: &quot;how about nipPLE&quot;?) They make it to the top ... oh, the Fishmans got there first. But the Griffins eat the Fishman boy on the descent. Yup, eat. &quot;I just hope he&apos;s not trapped in some crevice somewhere,&quot; says distraught Mr Fishman, searching for his son. &quot;Well my gut tells me he&apos;ll be squeezing himself out of a crevice very soon,&quot; says Peter.

I always drew things, since I was a boy. My mother was a painter, but every time I did a drawing, she&apos;d say, &quot;Be an architect&quot;, to make sure I didn&apos;t start wanting to become an artist. My pencil was always my tool. A lifetime later, it&apos;s still all about the pencil in the hand. What was your big breakthrough? Choosing, one lunchtime, not to go back\u00a0to the architecture practice in London that I worked for. Instead, I\u00a0went to a scrapyard and picked up a\u00a0Rover car seat to make the\u00a0Rover chair. The rest is history: 28\u00a0years later, at the Pompidou Centre in Paris where I had my retrospective, I was told off\u00a0for touching the very same chair without wearing white gloves. I\u00a0wonder what they&apos;d do if they saw my\u00a0cat going to sleep in it every night. Which of your designs are you most proud of? I don&apos;t understand this word &quot;pride&quot;. It&apos;s nice to see pieces I did 30 years ago changing hands for obscene amounts of money, or to walk home from work and see my Bookworm bookshelf in people&apos;s living rooms \u2013 but I&apos;m not really proud of any of it. Which artists do you most admire? We all owe a lot to Duchamp. But I am also a big admirer of Man Ray: he was brilliant on the BBC programme Great Artists in Their Own Words. Who or what inspires you? Everything that I&apos;ve seen until yesterday at four o&apos;clock in the afternoon. Everything can trigger something: good, bad, beautiful, not\u00a0so\u00a0beautiful. I&apos;m not a methodical person \u2013 I&apos;m restless and lazy, and I\u00a0jump from one thing to the other. Have new technologies changed the way you work? As I said, the pencil is still my main tool, but now it&apos;s not a soft 6B Caran d&apos;Ache, it&apos;s a light-pen on a tablet. And the studio looks different: where once we were welding steel and bending and polishing, we now have computers. How has the recession affected architecture in Britain? I think it might take us back to the way it was in London in the 80s, when I studied architecture. No one was building anything; it was all about architecture on paper. If an architect happened to build something, he had to apologise to his mates. But it did mean we were able to think about architecture without the burden of having clients. What&apos;s the biggest myth about architecture? That behind every good building you find an amazing client. There&apos;s a lot of\u00a0talented, idealistic, hardworking architects, and not enough good clients. Most choose you for the wrong reasons: they don&apos;t want to take risks. What&apos;s the worst thing anyone ever said about you? Designers accuse me of being an artist, artists accuse me of being an architect, and architects accuse me of being a designer. But it doesn&apos;t bother me too\u00a0much; that&apos;s just the way the fragmented world works. Do you suffer for your art? Not really. I quite enjoy it. In short Born: Tel Aviv, 1951. Career: Co-founded the architecture and design firm Ron Arad Associates in 1989. His designs include the Rover chair and the Bookworm bookshelf; buildings include the Belgo restaurants in London, and the Design Museum Holon, Israel. Became a Royal Academician in 2012.

Only &quot;arts and entertainment&quot; \u2013 a category that is boosted by Google&apos;s video site YouTube \u2013 and search engines were bigger, at 9.5% and 15.7% respectively. The figures, which do not include traffic from mobile phones, were compiled by SimilarWeb, a web measurement company based in Tel Aviv which tracks clicks online rather than total volume of traffic. Otherwise, the figures would be distorted by the sheer size of video files such as YouTube and the BBC&apos;s iPlayer, which is classed under &quot;news and media&quot; because it sits within the BBC&apos;s website. The data does not include illegal searches for child abuse, which typically travel over secret networks such as Tor, or use peer-to-peer technology to try to hide the abuser&apos;s identity.      &quot;Traffic on adult sites represents a huge portion of what people use the internet for, not just in the UK but around the world,&quot; said Daniel Buchuk, head of brand and strategy at SimilarWeb. &quot;It is astonishing to see that adult sites are more popular in the UK than all social networks combined.&quot; &quot;People don&apos;t just &apos;stumble&apos; upon adult content. More than 8% of Google UK searches led to adult sites in the past three months,&quot; he said. The data was released as internet service providers wrestle with the challenge posed by the prime minister, David Cameron, who earlier this week tasked them with ensuring that within 18 months anyone signing up for internet service would have to choose whether to opt in or out of being able to access pornographic sites. Internationally, it appears that Britain is far less interested in porn than Germany, where it makes up 12.5% of traffic \u2013 nearly half as much again as the UK \u2013 and somewhat less than Spain, where it comprises 9.6%. But Britain ranks above the world average of 7.7%, and just slightly ahead of the US, where adult traffic makes up 8.3% of clicks. Cameron&apos;s anti-pornography policy has been criticised by internet experts who say it will be ineffective and commentators who point to his refusal to take action over the Sun&apos;s topless Page 3 pictures as contradictory. The controversy over the proposed blocking intensified over the week when the website of Claire Perry MP, who has campaigned against access to pornography, was hacked to show adult pictures. It also emerged that the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei operates the HomeSafe filtering system used by TalkTalk, one of the UK&apos;s largest ISPs. Cameron praised HomeSafe when launching his scheme \u2013 but it emerged that the system collects data about every URL that customers try to access. The system holds a list of &quot;banned&quot; URLs determined to contain pornographic content; every request via TalkTalk&apos;s system is routed through Huawei&apos;s system and checked against the list, but requests from customers who have opted to view pornography are ignored. That, campaigners argue, means there is in effect no &quot;opt out&quot; from the filters \u2013 only from their application. The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said on Wednesday that &quot;protecting children from seeing legal adult pornography \u2026 [is] best addressed by parents following the excellent advice provided by Get Safe Online&quot;. Martyn Thomas of the IET warned that &quot;universal blocking of websites, search terms and content is a blunt, ineffective tool&quot;. Buchuk said: &quot;The hardest part for the government, which is what companies like Facebook or Tumblr are currently struggling with, will be to draw the line on what gets banned.&quot; SimilarWeb collects its data by watching the activity of people who have installed one of its browser plugins, which Buchuk said were installed in millions of machines worldwide. Around 1% of the internet populations in most western countries use its plugins, he said, allowing a reliable estimate to be made. The data includes cases where people go to pornographic subdomains within sites such as Tumblr, now owned by Yahoo, but not on YouTube, which includes content restricted to adults which is protected by a login. Buchuk suggested that the policy of forcing people to choose whether to opt in or out of accessing adult sites could have dramatic knock-on effects: &quot;Other industries such as online gambling often rely on display advertising on adults sites.&quot; That could mean lower revenues for both the sites and the gambling companies. \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 29 and 30 July 2013 to clarify that Martyn Thomas represents the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).", "publicationDate": "2013-07-26T16:35:09Z", "title": "Porn sites get more internet traffic in UK than social networks or shopping", "sentences": ["The figures, which do not include traffic from mobile phones, were compiled by SimilarWeb, a web measurement company based in Tel Aviv which tracks clicks online rather than total volume of traffic."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/26/porn-sites-internet-traffic-uk"}, {"tags": ["Music documentary", "Pop and rock", "John Lennon", "Jimi Hendrix", "Frank Zappa", "Leonard Cohen", "Music", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "     Reading this on mobile?

Afterwards, John Lennon came up and asked me why I hadn&apos;t asked them any questions. I told him I found the whole thing pretty silly. He laughed, and when I told him I\u00a0was studying moral sciences, he thought me pretty silly, too. He wanted someone to show him around the university \u2013 I realised much later that he was very interested in education. So we meet up later and he&apos;s in disguise \u2013 a dreadful one, with a large fedora hat, long brown raincoat and fake beard. There were no screaming fans following him on campus. I got him into places like the Wren library, which he enjoyed. I\u00a0got the feeling he was interested in getting an education, a formal one which he never did get.&quot; This is how Palmer, now in his 70s, talks: in perfectly paced anecdotes, full of colour, character, drama, insight, action \u2013 and of course stars, generally the biggest stars of all. The same could be said of his acclaimed music documentaries, four of which have just been released on DVD. Their subjects are Liberace, Leonard Cohen, Frank Zappa and the Beatles. As he is enjoying explaining, it was the Fab Four, and Lennon in particular, who set him on a path that would lead to over 100 films about everyone from Maria Callas to Igor Stravinsky. Lennon gave Palmer his number, saying if he was ever in London to call so he could return the favour. But Palmer had no intention of even visiting the city. &quot;I was going to be an academic,&quot; he says. Nevertheless, two\u00a0years later, he ended up there, working for the BBC. &quot;I&apos;d worked with\u00a0Ken Russell on his Isadora Duncan film and Jonathan Miller on Alice in Wonderland. My first film was on Benjamin Britten, and it was the first British documentary to be networked across America. This was seen as some\u00a0success, but I don&apos;t think it was much down to the quality of the film.&quot; It got him noticed, and he quickly rose through the BBC ranks, allowed more freedom than a newcomer could normally expect. When he finally met up with Lennon again (who by then was &quot;intergalactic&quot;), the Beatle told him what he must do. &quot;There were all these great bands around, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and they weren&apos;t getting any serious coverage. You could do Top of the Pops or Juke Box Jury \u2013 that was it. People like Hendrix didn&apos;t want to do those. John told me it was my duty to get them on to television. I\u00a0wasn&apos;t much into that type of music\u00a0then, but anyone could see how incredible Hendrix was. Television was just ignoring these people. I said, &apos;John what can I do? I&apos;m new at the BBC and I don&apos;t have an &quot;in&quot; with any of these bands.&apos; He said, &apos;I&apos;ll provide the introductions, you can do everything else.&apos;&quot; So Lennon went through his contacts, and Palmer dealt with the artists directly, filming Hendrix, Eric Burdon (of the Animals), Cream, Frank Zappa and Pete Townshend, gaining the sort of access that could only be dreamt of today. Lennon also provided the title for Palmer&apos;s examination of politics and rock&apos;n&apos;roll \u2013 All My Loving \u2013 as well as &quot;darkly hinting that the Rolling Stones mustn&apos;t be included. Mick Jagger has never forgiven me for that.&quot; It took a while for All My Loving to be broadcast. David Attenborough, then BBC2 controller, vowed it would air over his dead body, says Palmer. When it finally did reach the living rooms of Britain, its impact was seismic. &quot;David Jacobs [Juke Box Jury&apos;s presenter] came up to me at a BBC party and very angrily poked me in the chest, saying I&apos;d ruined his career. Within about three weeks of All My Loving being aired, Juke Box Jury was cancelled. They&apos;d seen the writing on the wall.&quot;     Ringo Starr as Frank Zappa in 200 Motels     At the start of the 1970s, having left the BBC, Palmer made the surreal film Frank Zappa&apos;s 200 Motels. He was seen as a safe pair of hands, one of the few people capable of making something watchable out of Zappa&apos;s script about him and his band going crazy in a small town. The script, Palmer recalls, was in a state. &quot;He dragged in this huge trunk full of scraps of paper, stacks of them, plus notes and drawings. I said to him, &apos;I see what you&apos;re trying to do, to show the effects of a drug trip. We can do this, but not on the budget we have.&apos;&quot; Zappa&apos;s ideas for trippy visuals would have been too expensive and time-consuming to realise, since movie-style special effects required specialist equipment. So Palmer had a brainwave: shoot on videotape, which had steadily improved since its invention in the 1950s, reaching the point where it could conceivably handle being blown up to cinema-sized screens. &quot;I met with whoever was in charge of MGM that month, and I remember him slowly putting his teacup down on his desk when I told him my plan, saying, &apos;What&apos;s videotape?&apos;&quot; Palmer&apos;s experiment didn&apos;t just work \u2013 it was cheaper, and the results could be transferred back to film for conventional editing. A bizarre, anything-goes mix of druggy interludes, hippy slang, animation, music and counter-culture humour, 200 Motels proved a hit on the midnight-movie circuit, with the part of Zappa played by Ringo Starr, thinly disguised in\u00a0beard and wig. By the time he made Bird on a Wire, his 1972 film about Leonard Cohen on tour in Europe, Palmer was feeling bullish. &quot;I told them I wanted total access, no door closed.&quot; He was in luck. &quot;It seemed Cohen was going to retire after the tour, the record company wasn&apos;t interested, so there were no company people around. It was just the band and our little film crew in the dressing room.&quot;     Bird on a Wire    The result is a spellbindingly intimate portrait: Cohen comes across as supremely focused, polite and gentle, not to mention exhausted. It culminates in a gig in Tel Aviv. The audience, trying to get closer to the stage, are roughly handled by the plentiful security as Cohen softly and firmly calls\u00a0for calm. &quot;Cohen singing Bird on a Wire at that gig, tears streaming down his face \u2013 that&apos;s the man.&quot; For the\u00a0live portions of this mesmerising work (which Palmer recently recut, fixing all the tampering that occurred after it left his hands), the camera is fixed tightly on Cohen. The\u00a0band, the venue and the rest of the\u00a0world fade away. When we move on to La Divina, his 1987 Maria Callas documentary, Palmer offers an insight into his approach. &quot;Rather than show her as an opera-singer who is a fragile, damaged woman in deep trouble, I presented her as a fragile, damaged woman in deep trouble who is also an opera singer.&quot; Another thing that marks out his documentaries is the lack of voiceover. &quot;Oh, I hate it when they try to tell you what to think,&quot; he says. My epiphany came with 2001: A Space Odyssey. The beginning of the film, the apes, all tells a story without words, just the music. I left the cinema invigorated and desperate to get back to editing.&quot; I wonder what Palmer thinks of Behind the Candelabra, Steven Soderbergh&apos;s new film about Liberace. &quot;It&apos;s a great movie, and Michael Douglas gives a career-best performance. But that&apos;s not Liberace. Everyone knew he was gay, but he never minced like that. He&apos;d walk across a room like anyone else. He&apos;d look you dead in the eye. He was straight as a die.&quot; Palmer pauses. &quot;He was incredibly generous, though \u2013 they got that right. I remember we were shooting him around his swirl bath. He offered to let us use it. I thought it a bit much, and he admitted he never used it himself \u2013 yet there are entire scenes set in that bath in the movie.&quot; What they failed to capture, he adds, was the man&apos;s excessive wealth. &quot;Soderbergh certainly didn&apos;t have the budget for that.&quot; Most of Palmer&apos;s films were made for TV, something he believes would be unworkable today. &quot;In those days, you were dealing with one or two BBC people. They&apos;d defend you, stick up for you if you made a mistake as long as you were honest about it. They&apos;d trust you to go off and make your films unsupervised. Today, it&apos;s all committee-run, TV and music. I think [director general] Tony Hall is the best thing to happen to the BBC in decades. I wrote to him after they sacked 500 people telling him he should sack more.&quot; Years ago, Ken Russell called Palmer. &quot;He asked me if I could remember who\u00a0was in charge of production at the BBC in the autumn of 1971. I told him, &apos;Frankly, Ken, I can&apos;t remember nor do I really care.&apos; &apos;Exactly!&apos; he boomed. &apos;They&apos;re all gone and forgotten and we&apos;re still making films.&apos;&quot; Indeed they are. There&apos;s Palmer&apos;s forthcoming and long-gestated film about Vangelis. And he&apos;s currently arranging screenings of Nocturne, a documentary about Benjamin Britten made for the composer&apos;s centenary year. Naturally, this being Palmer, these aren&apos;t your run-of-the-mill screenings: one will take place in the White House. The\u00a0plan was to show it in November, on what would have been Britten&apos;s 100th birthday, but the date was shifted. &quot;That&apos;s not actually on his birthday, I\u00a0told them. But they said it&apos;s the only day Mrs Obama is free to attend.&quot; \u2022 Leonard Cohen: Bird on a Wire, Frank Zappa&apos;s 200 Motels, All You Need is Love: The Beatles, and The World of Liberace are out now.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-28T18:00:00Z", "title": "Tony Palmer: he's with the band", "sentences": ["It culminates in a gig in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/tony-palmer-hes-with-band"}, {"tags": ["Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Ireland", "Europe"], "article": "US drugmaker Perrigo has agreed to buy Irish biotech firm Elan in an $8.6bn (\u00a35.6bn) deal that will knock millions off the Michigan-based company&apos;s tax bill as it takes advantage of the emerald isle&apos;s corporate tax rate. Perrigo, which makes over-the-counter medicines and vitamins, said it would make annual savings of more than $150m (\u00a398m) in taxes and operating costs by moving its headquarters to Ireland, where corporation tax is 12.5% compared with the US rate of 35%. Joe Papa, Perrigo chief executive, described the deal as &quot;financially compelling&quot; and said it would mean the combined company would pay a corporate tax rate in &quot;the high teens&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re excited by what it means for the international expansion. We think it&apos;s financially compelling and when you put it together with an Irish domicile that has operational tax synergies, we think it&apos;s a really compelling story.&quot; The takeover, which gives Perrigo shareholders 71% of the company to Elan&apos;s 29%, shows the appeal of Ireland&apos;s ultra-low corporate tax rates, which have attracted hundreds of foreign companies, including tech giants Apple and Google. Ireland&apos;s tax system came under the microscope of the US Senate in May when lawmakers accused Apple of using subsidiaries, ostensibly based in Ireland, to avoid paying billions to the US Treasury. Perrigo&apos;s company headquarters will move to Ireland, although shares in the new company are expected to trade on the New York and Tel Aviv stock exchanges. Perrigo has had a Tel Aviv listing since it acquired Israeli-based Agis industries in 2005. The merger signals a revival of animal spirits in the corporate world after a fallow period for dealmakers following the economic slump. News of the deal helped lift the FTSE 100 in early trading, as investors also digested news of the $35bn (\u00a323bn) mega merger between France&apos;s Publicis and America&apos;s Omnicom to create the world&apos;s largest advertising firm. The Perrigo-Elan tie-up underlines the ease with which companies can acquire a cheaper tax rate. Hundreds of US companies are based in Ireland, where they pay an average tax rate of 8%, according to a report by the US Congressional Budget Office. Perrigo is only the latest to move across the Atlantic, following US pharmaceutical company Actavis, which announced in May that it was buying Dublin-based Warner Chilcott in a $8.5bn (\u00a35.6bn) deal that will see the company based in Dublin. Since it was founded in 1887 by a general store entrepreneur, who sent travelling salesman bearing patent medicines across the American midwest, Perrigo has grown into a global company with 9,500 employees that develops, makes and distributes generic medicines, as well as over-the-counter remedies, diet pills and infant formula. If the takeover is approved by regulators, Perrigo will reap the benefits of Elan&apos;s blockbuster drug Tysabri, seen as one of the most effective treatments for multiple sclerosis. Elan, a co-inventor of the drug, earns 12% royalties on Tysabri&apos;s global sales, which were worth $1.6bn in 2012 and are expected to grow rapidly, as the drug is taken up in new countries and to treat other diseases. Tysabri is Elan&apos;s main product, after the company sold off almost all of its drugs after the high-profile failure of experimental Alzheimer&apos;s drug bapineuzumab, which never lived up to hopes it would fight progression of the debilitating brain disease. The tie-up with Perrigo brings an end to a tumultuous period for Elan, which has fought off three hostile takeover bids from New York-based Royalty Pharma. After the flop of its latest bid that valued Elan at $6.7bn, Royalty Pharma announced it was giving up its fight to acquire the company. Perrigo will pay Elan shareholders $6.25 in cash and 0.076 of the new Perrigo company&apos;s stock, per share, in a deal that Elan chairman Robert Ingram described as &quot;an excellent transaction&quot;. Elan shares are valued at $16.50 \u2013 a premium of 10% on their closing price on 26 July. Barclays and HSBC have put up $4.35bn in bridging capital to underwrite the deal.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T17:16:55Z", "title": "Perrigo to buy Irish biotech firm Elan in $8.6bn deal", "sentences": ["Perrigo&apos;s company headquarters will move to Ireland, although shares in the new company are expected to trade on the New York and Tel Aviv stock exchanges.", "Perrigo has had a Tel Aviv listing since it acquired Israeli-based Agis industries in 2005."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/29/perrigo-buy-biotech-firm-elan"}, {"tags": ["Championship", "Football", "Reading", "Wigan Athletic", "Charlton Athletic", "Leeds United", "Ipswich Town", "Watford", "Leicester City", "Nottingham Forest", "Birmingham City", "Blackpool", "Bolton Wanderers", "Brighton & Hove Albion", "QPR", "Blackburn Rovers", "Yeovil Town", "Derby County", "Burnley", "Barnsley", "Bournemouth", "Middlesbrough", "Millwall", "Huddersfield", "Sheffield Wednesday", "Doncaster Rovers"], "article": "Favourites The Championship is the most unpredictable league around but previews of the battle for promotion tend to be predictable in their focus, more often than not homing in on the teams that have been relegated from the Premier League, partly because they are what we know best and partly because they should have more money, bigger crowds and better players. That&apos;s the theory anyway and it&apos;s not foolproof: relegated teams can be in a state of financial disrepair (Birmingham and Portsmouth) or they can self-implode (Wolves). In the past five seasons, four teams have bounced straight back into the top flight: Birmingham City in 2009, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion in 2010 and West Ham United in 2012. So, with that in mind, where better to start than by putting forward the title-winning credentials of two of the relegated sides? Nigel Adkins&apos;s sacking by Southampton last season was baffling and, although he was unable to prevent a doomed Reading from going down, his exploits at St Mary&apos;s means his new side, who have been boosted by the arrival of Wayne Bridge, will enter the season with justifiable optimism. Reading never looked strong enough to survive last season but they have not lost anyone of note and their squad has not altered radically from the one that won the Championship two seasons ago. While Reading seem settled, there are likely to be more changes at Wigan Athletic. Roberto Mart\u00ednez has left for Everton, taking Arouna Kon\u00e9 and Antol\u00edn Alcaraz with him, and they may not be able to hold on to James McCarthy, Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman, who are all far too talented not to be playing in the Premier League. However, Wigan&apos;s new manager, Owen Coyle, who has already invested in Scott Carson, Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 and Grant Holt, would probably be able to use the money from their sales. The major worry for the FA Cup holders, though, is that their exertions in the Europa League during the winter will put a dent in their bid for automatic promotion. The losing side in the play-off final can often find it difficult to recover and it will be a challenge for Gianfranco Zola to ensure there is no slump at Watford after their defeat to Crystal Palace at Wembley in May. Perhaps a bigger problem for Watford, who are one of three clubs owned by the Pozzo family, along with Granada and Udinese, to overcome is their nasty habit of freezing at crucial moments. Last season they lost five of their last 10 league games and threw away 14 points in the final 15 minutes of games. When they are in the mood, though, few teams will be as dangerous as Watford and although they cannot call upon Matej Vydra, the Championship&apos;s player of the season last year, there have been more arrivals from Udinese and Granada. Few managers will be under as much pressure as Nigel Pearson, whose Leicester City will be expected to maintain a strong challenge after fading badly last season and eventually losing to Watford in dramatic circumstances in the play-offs, while their east Midlands rivals, Nottingham Forest, will be awkward opponents under Billy Davies, who won promotion with Derby County in 2007. Jamie Mackie is an intelligent addition from QPR. Play-off hopefuls The Championship&apos;s volatile nature was summed up last season by Peterborough, who filled the third relegation slot, finishing 14 points off a play-off place, while six points separated Derby County in 10th place from Barnsley in 21st. Few leagues are as open and sometimes it only takes one good run at the right time to put a side in contention. It means that Charlton Athletic, where Chris Powell continues to impress, Birmingham City and Blackpool, who may have done enough to keep the highly-coveted Tom Ince for another year, will enter the season with something approaching quiet confidence. Dougie Freedman will also be expected to prove himself in his first full season as Bolton Wanderer&apos;s manager, while Brighton will hope to be there or thereabouts under Oscar Garc\u00eda, Gus Poyet&apos;s replacement. The side to watch out for could be Ipswich Town. When Mick McCarthy replaced Paul Jewell in November, Ipswich were bottom with one win and the Tractor Boys were on the road marked League One. By the end of the season, they were safely ensconced in mid-table. McCarthy is proven at this level, having won the title with Sunderland and Wolves, although this could be a season too soon for Ipswich. Life has rarely been easy for Leeds United during the past 10 years but for the first time in a while there is a feeling that they may be heading in the right direction. That has much to do with their new owners appointing Brian McDermott in March, while Ken Bates&apos;s ties with the club were severed last week. McDermott was unfortunate to lose his job at Reading, with whom he led an unfancied group of players to the title in 2012. However, given that Leeds finished 13th last season, no one should expect any instant miracles. Strugglers What to make of QPR? Maybe they will run away with the league, maybe they will challenge for the play-offs, maybe they will slumber in mid-table or maybe they will do a Wolves and go down. The last option seems unlikely under Harry Redknapp but there is a lingering sense that he may jump at any vacancy that happens to present itself in the Premier League, especially if QPR start badly. He did not last long in the Championship with Southampton in 2005. It feels as if every positive at QPR comes with a caveat. They have J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Joey Barton and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my but will any of them be there once the transfer window shuts? Richard Dunne, signed on a free, is an excellent defender but will he stay fit? Redknapp is shrewd in the transfer market \u2013 and definitely not a wheeler-dealer \u2013 but with all the upheaval, can he create a coherent side in time for the new season? At least the signings of Karl Henry and Danny Simpson suggest a return to the hard-working ethos that won QPR promotion in 2011. Still, QPR&apos;s plight could be worse. They could, for instance, be Blackburn Rovers. Their long-suffering fans probably do not have a clue what to expect from the campaign but they will know better than to anticipate it to be fun under the unacceptably preposterous Venky&apos;s. Blackburn had four managers last season. How long will Gary Bowyer last? Barnsley escaped relegation by the skin of their teeth last season while Millwall may struggle after losing Kenny Jackett. As for the promoted sides, Doncaster could be on the verge of a lucrative takeover and Bournemouthwill hope the cherubic Eddie Howe can guide them to safety. However, Yeovil, who were promoted with a wage bill of less than \u00a31m, know that they will be up against it. Gary Johnson will need to galvanise a small squad and bank on his inspirational striker, Paddy Madden, firing in front of goal. New managers Owen Coyle is looking to rebuild his reputation at Wigan after being sacked by Bolton last season. He impressed for a while at Bolton and, although he was unlucky with injuries, his record in the transfer market was poor. He is unlikely to be as tactically adventurous as Mart\u00ednez but knows the Championship, having won promotion with Burnley in 2009. Paul Dickov was sacked by Oldham despite beating Liverpool in the FA Cup, but he has been given a chance by Doncaster after Brian Flynn was made director of football. Oscar Garc\u00eda is, at first glance, a gamble by Brighton after Gus Poyet&apos;s departure. The 40-year-old Spaniard arrives in England having taken charge of 26 senior games with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel. Yet he led them to their first title in a decade and can be expected to maintain Poyet&apos;s free-flowing style. A former West Ham captain, Steve Lomas, as Millwall&apos;s new manager? A brave appointment but a potentially canny one: Lomas led St Johnstone to third in the SPL last season and the second qualifying round of the Europa League. Players to watch Matt Smith (Leeds) The 6ft 6in striker scored two goals to help Oldham beat Liverpool 3-2 in the fourth round of the FA Cup, before he scored a last-minute equaliser against Everton and a consolation in the replay at Goodison Park. His exploits have earned him a move to Elland Road and the lack of pressure could aid a 24-year-old who was playing non-league football two years ago. Liam Bridcutt (Brighton) The deep-lying midfielder was one of Brighton&apos;s most impressive performers last season but continues to operate under the radar. The Scotland international is neat and tidy in a side based on possession football. Lewis McGugan (Watford) Most of Watford&apos;s signings have come from Granada and Udinese and the most eye-catching was Diego Fabbrini, a 22-year-old winger who has been capped by Italy. However, McGugan, signed on a free from Nottingham Forest, could be the bargain of the summer if Zola can help him become more consistent. \u2022 This article has been amended after originally stating that Bournemouth were League One champions", "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T11:32:51Z", "title": "Championship 2013-14 season preview | Jacob Steinberg", "sentences": ["The 40-year-old Spaniard arrives in England having taken charge of 26 senior games with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/02/championship-preview-2013-14"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East peace talks"], "article": "In the unlikely setting of the West Bank&apos;s biblical landscape, amid stony hills and valleys where sheep and goats bleat under ancient olive trees, an urban planner&apos;s dream is taking shape. A gleaming hi-tech city, with homes for 40,000 residents, cinemas, shopping malls, schools, landscaped walkways, office blocks, a conference centre, restaurants and cafes, is rising on a crest within sight \u2013 on a clear day \u2013 of the Tel Aviv skyline. It looks a little like a new Israeli settlement. But the billion-dollar city of Rawabi is the first planned urban centre to be built for Palestinians. And phase one of the development \u2013 600 near-completed apartments \u2013 has just sold out, with around 8,000 potential buyers registered for homes yet to be constructed. The level of interest reflects social and financial shifts in Palestinian society and symbolises the economic potential of a future state of Palestine. More than half of those who have signed contracts have taken out long-term mortgages and a high proportion are nuclear families in which the mother works outside the home. A small number are single women who plan to live alone, unusual in Palestinian society.     The untouched site a few miles north of Ramallah, West Bank, before the ground was broken in 2011.    A third of the $1bn (\u00a3640m) investment in Rawabi has come from the private Palestinian conglomerate Massar International, and the rest from Qatar. &quot;The risks are extremely high,&quot; said Bashar Masri, the chief executive of Massar and the driving force behind Rawabi. &quot;But I wanted to create an impact project, and I wanted to show we can build a great economy and create jobs.&quot; The construction phase of the project has created 8,000-10,000 jobs \u2013 one in three workers are women \u2013 paying, at the bottom end, 30% above the Palestinian minimum wage. But the ambition is for up to 5,000 permanent jobs, mostly in the hi-tech and service industries, to be located in the offices and facilities of the new city when it is complete. Planning for Rawabi \u2013 which means &quot;Hills&quot; \u2013 began five years ago, and the ground was broken in 2011. The target market was young middle-class Palestinian families living in chaotic and overcrowded West Bank cities, who would be attracted by modern, streamlined, hi-tech apartments, fabulous views and open spaces, almost every conceivable consumer and leisure facility on the doorstep \u2013 and at a price 15-20% lower than Ramallah, a few miles to the south. Among the city&apos;s first residents will be the Khabi family, who have just made a $15,000 down payment on a three-bedroom apartment. The rest of the $102,000 total is coming from the Khabis&apos; first mortgage.     An artist's impression of the finished Rawabi, which has created more than 8,000 construction jobs.    &quot;It feels a bit scary,&quot; said Amal, 42, the mother of four children. She and her husband, Adel, 47, will both commute to insurance company jobs in Ramallah. &quot;We are telling our friends to move here too,&quot; she said. The Khabis fit the profile of the typical Rawabi homebuyer: in their early 40s, husband and wife working in the private sector, with a household income well above the average. Their parents&apos; generation would have lived with or near members of a large extended family; these couples are opting for a more westernised, and atomised, lifestyle. Seven percent of Rawabi homebuyers so far are single professional women; 11% are Christian (compared with 2% of the Palestinian population). A small proportion are buying as investment for rental or future resale; 4% of buyers are Palestinian expatriates. &quot;Young, internet-savvy, educated English-speakers,&quot; was how Ramzi Jaber, Rawabi&apos;s commercial manager, described his clientele. Around half have taken mortgages to finance their new home. The hilltop sales centre, which shows a slick 3D film of imaginary life in Rawabi and allows purchasers to choose from a range of options for bathroom and kitchen finishes, lighting and floor tiles, also houses representatives of Arab banks in glass booths offering long-term loans. &quot;Islamic financing&quot;, in which interest payments \u2013 forbidden to Muslims \u2013 are replaced by service charges, is available. Masri was disappointed that more would-be purchasers had not taken mortgages, saying this was the key to &quot;the sense of security&quot; that home-ownership gives to &quot;all communities&quot;. A mortgage education programme was aimed at dispelling apprehension of long-term loans, especially among lower-income families. Even so, attracting potential homebuyers for the planned 6,000 units has not been difficult; luring international companies to take office and retail space has been more problematic. Some potential takers withdrew following last November&apos;s war in Gaza, according to Masri. &quot;We&apos;ve not been successful yet,&quot; he admitted. A major deterrent is that Rawabi is situated in territory under Israeli military occupation, a situation that has no clear prospect of changing despite the start of formal peace talks next week. Masri has sought co-operation from the Israeli authorities for the development but it took several years to get permission to build a road to the site that ran for half a kilometre through Area C, the 60% of the West Bank under total Israeli military control. Eventually a temporary permit \u2013 which requires annual renewal \u2013 was granted last year. Water has been another huge challenge, both for construction and to service the finished buildings. Israel controls almost all water supplies; 600,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem consume almost six times as much water as 2.7 million Palestinians. Construction in Rawabi halts for a day or more each week because of water shortages. &quot;I spend 70% of my time dealing with issues like these,&quot; said Masri. He is also critical of the Palestinian Authority, which has failed to deliver on a pledge to supply Rawabi&apos;s infrastructure at a cost of $150m. Rawabi&apos;s investors have been forced to finance the provision of power, water, sewage, schools and roads, adding 10-12% to the cost of a home. &quot;I never envisioned that we would not have this funding with all the donor money that has come to Palestine in recent years,&quot; said Masri. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed that our government has not set this [project] as a priority.&quot; Masri and the Rawabi project have not escaped criticism. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign has accused the businessman of helping to &quot;whitewash [Israel&apos;s] ongoing occupation, colonisation and apartheid against the Palestinian people&quot; by maintaining links with Israeli industry and by consulting Israeli architects and engineers on Rawabi. Israeli Jews from the nearby settlement of Ateret, which is illegal under international law and likely to be evacuated under any peace deal, complain that Palestinians are building tens of thousands of new homes when the expansion of their colony is constrained by political considerations. &quot;It feels like unfair treatment of Jewish residents,&quot; said Orit Flint, 35, who described it as a &quot;human rights&quot; issue. Undeterred by either radical boycotters or Israeli settlers, Masri is optimistic about the future, seeing Rawabi as part of the Palestinian nation-building effort. &quot;I was born and grew up in Nablus at a time when carrying a Palestinian flag on the street was enough to be shot dead [by Israeli soldiers],&quot; he said. &quot;The reason I&apos;m optimistic is that the Palestinian people aren&apos;t going anywhere, and eventually they&apos;ll give us a state.&quot; From the terrace of the sales centre, he points to a skeletal building and the unfinished penthouse apartment that will eventually become his family&apos;s home. &quot;We are still living under military occupation, but we have made this successful,&quot; he said. Rawabi will not be complete for another seven years, but creating the next modern Palestinian city, Rawabi 2, &quot;will not be as difficult&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-08T13:30:09Z", "title": "Rawabi rises: new West Bank city symbolises Palestine's economic potential", "sentences": ["A gleaming hi-tech city, with homes for 40,000 residents, cinemas, shopping malls, schools, landscaped walkways, office blocks, a conference centre, restaurants and cafes, is rising on a crest within sight \u2013 on a clear day \u2013 of the Tel Aviv skyline."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/rawabi-west-bank-city-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Apps", "Technology"], "article": "Few people would connect the drab olive green of an Israeli army uniform with the cutting edge of fashion.

Israeli tech firms Nice, Comverse and Check Point were all created by 8200 alumni or based on technology originally developed by the unit. With the emergence of consumer apps based on crunching vast amounts of information known as &quot;big data&quot;, Israel is a decade ahead of the US and Europe \u2013 and all because of the military. New startups such as Stylit hope to emulate the success of Waze, a big-data-based driving app developed by former IDF cyber-squaddies and bought by Google for more than $1bn (\u00a3654m). &quot;A lot of the practices and the technology that we used in the army are used today at Stylit to address the problems we are aiming to solve in fashion,&quot; said Yaniv Nissim, a former 8200 programmer who designed the company&apos;s algorithm by combining the wisdom of former army tech geeks with fashion industry stylists. &quot;The technology is mainly machine-learning technology. It&apos;s how to take huge amounts of information and from that to understand users&apos; behaviour.&quot; Big data predictive algorithms developed to prevent enemy attacks also power Any.Do, one of the world&apos;s most popular productivity apps for mobile devices. For Nissim&apos;s army buddies, 8200 is Israeli hi-tech&apos;s old school tie, opening doors to a vast group of like-minded and similarly-trained entrepreneurs. Rompr is a mobile app through which parents can share information about activities for toddlers. Chief executive Noa Levy and the three co-founders all served in elite IDF tech units. &quot;Trying to make sense of the patterns you find when you study a lot of data and turning that into actionable information \u2013 that&apos;s the guiding principle that we have in Rompr and also something that is very important in those technological units,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s more the mindset than the actual technology. Then you can go out and do it on a completely different series of tasks, using the same methodology.&quot; Until a decade ago, Unit 8200 was a secret. Then it starred in the book Start-Up Nation, which chronicled Israel&apos;s emergence as a hi-tech powerhouse with more venture capital investment per person than anywhere in the world and the largest number of Nasdaq-listed companies after the US and China. Three years ago, 8200 alumni decided to emerge from the shadows and offer their expertise to other young Israeli entrepreneurs. The result was the 8200 entrepreneurship and innovation support program (EISP), a five-month hi-tech incubator in which unit alumni volunteer to\u00a0mentor early-stage startups. So far, 22\u00a0of them have received funding totalling $21m (\u00a313.5m) and employ 200 people, joining the 230,000 employees of Israel&apos;s 5,000 tech companies that earn $25bn a year \u2013 a quarter of Israel&apos;s total exports. Nir Lempert, a reserve colonel, former deputy commander of Unit 8200 and chairman of its alumni association, says the unit handpicks the brightest teenagers in the country then trains them to solve problems in multidisciplinary teams using methods usually associated with business, not battles. They are encouraged to think differently. &quot;The central mission of the unit is to save lives, to prevent terror and other attacks,&quot; says Lempert. &quot;We teach our people that the mission is so important that there is no possibility of failure.&quot; The 8200 legend attracts increasing numbers of young Israelis into IDF tech units. Mamram, the main IT support unit of the IDF, now offers a six-month pre-army course at its headquarters base in a suburban street on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. From dawn into the night, recruits study programming skills, teamwork, project management and \u2013\u00a0most important \u2013 how to be creative.

In front of a large crowd at the AIS Arena, the Boomers and Tall Blacks both started well before an imposing third quarter performance saw the Australian side post 28 points to the New Zealander&apos;s seven. Try as they might the Kiwi side could not bounce back, and the Boomers secured a 76-63 victory to take the series 2-0. Patty Mills looked in his element throughout the game, recording 21 points in a performance that Australian basketball fans will hope the point guard can repeat regularly in the forthcoming NBA season. The Canberra local was unsurprisingly awarded most valuable player, much to the crowd&apos;s delight. Maccabi Tel Aviv&apos;s Joe Ingles also starred for the Boomers, collecting five assists and 12 points, while Luke Nevill managed six rebounds in 19 minutes on the court. Rebounding was perhaps the one edge the Tall Blacks had over Australia, with Mika Vukona picking up seven defensive and two offensive rebounds. Corey Webster led the point scoring for New Zealand with 16, shooting 50% from inside the arc, but the Kiwis were unable to match their opponent&apos;s superior shooting. Looking for a strong first quarter after a sluggish start in Auckland midweek, the Boomers opened up a small lead which they took to the break, with Ingles and Mills both opening their accounts. The Tall Blacks fought back in the second though, and the New Zealanders found themselves level and then ahead for large parts of the quarter. Even a late three from Matthew Dellavedova couldn&apos;t help the Boomers cause, as the Kiwis closed out a six point lead into half time. Unlike their rugby union counterparts however, the Boomers quickly fought back thanks to an inspiring few minutes from the San Antonio Spurs point guard Mills. The Canberran made a lay-up after his half-court steal effort, before knocking down a three within the first minute of the third quarter. Led by their NBA star, Australia dominated throughout the penultimate stanza, notching up a 10 point unanswered run in the first few minutes, followed by 13 more without reply later in the quarter. Mills demonstrated why he is considered one of the best Australian basketballers, making 13 points in less than seven minutes in a commanding performance. Mills got a warm send off from the crowd after sinking his third three-pointer for the quarter, as he was replaced by exciting young talent Dante Exum. The 18-year-old may not have had long on the court, but nevertheless impressed with a nice field goal. If Exum and Simmons represent the next generation for Australian basketball, they certainly did little wrong in their limited minutes during the series. Both got a large round of applause from an appreciative crowed when the duo came on again towards the end of the game. Trailing by 15 points heading into the final break, the Tall Blacks desperately needed a comeback, yet even the best efforts from captain Vukona would not be sufficient. With a big lead on their side the Boomers controlled the final quarter, and the game petered out with the Boomers holding on to a 13-point victory.  With little but bragging rights to compete for, as both sides have automatic entry into the 2014 Basketball World Cup, the final few minutes saw little action as the happy crowd applauded their heroes. \u2022 Earlier in the afternoon, the Australian Opals secured qualification to the 2014 Fiba World Championship for Women in Turkey with a dominant 84-66 win over the New Zealand Tall Ferns. Despite not being her usual dominant self, Lauren Jackson nevertheless managed to lead the scoring for the Opals with 21 points, while Belinda Snell impressed with 63% shooting from outside the arc on her way to 17 points. Both sides started the first quarter with intensity, trading points almost evenly with entry to the World Championship on the line. A 14-4 run after the first break may have seen the New Zealanders go ahead, but a powerful Kelly Wilson hook shot inspired the Opals to a five point lead at half time. Playing well and with only a narrow margin between them and the Opals, the Tall Ferns must have been confident heading out for the third quarter. Yet just as they did in the first leg of the series on Wednesday, the Australians made their move and did not look back, scoring 13 unanswered point during a dominant run. From then on the women in green barely looked troubled, and despite a brief Kiwi fight back Australia&apos;s ticket to Turkey never seemed in doubt.

Only in Israel, right in their midst, people are busy with their summer vacations. Here, the hottest news in recent weeks was the nomination fiasco of the national bank governor. Even the resumption of peace talks with the Palestinians, after five years of impasse, raises only little interest or hope here. Israel has never appeared so remote and disconnected from its neighbours. Seen through a mainstream political prism in Israel, the latest switch in the Arab spring revolutions with the military retaking of Egypt simply proves that the Jewish state is, as former prime minister Ehud Barak once said, &quot;a villa in the jungle&quot;. Despite all its inter-tribal rivalries and domestic tensions and even its never-ending occupation of the West Bank, Israel is uncharacteristically an island of calm in a troubled region. Or, in popular terms, &quot;they&quot; kill each other while we go to the beach. Israel&apos;s Arab community is torn between the duelling sides in Syria and Egypt. But the Jewish majority, viewing itself as an unfortunate bastion of the west, looks at the bloodshed across the border as if it were on Mars. Few\u00a0Israeli Jews bother to learn Arabic or to immerse themselves in regional culture; cross-border trade is minimal; and the internet has shortened the mental distance from Tel Aviv to New York and Berlin, its cultural beacons. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is an old adherent to &quot;the villa in the jungle&quot; school of thought. His political and cultural references are entirely Anglo-American, he has hardly ever visited an Israeli Arab town, has probably never met an Arab intellectual, and views the neighbourhood with a mixture of suspicion and fear. The upheavals of the past three years merely strengthened this worldview. Netanyahu&apos;s outgoing cabinet secretary, Zvi Hauser, told my colleague Ari Shavit in an interview last week: &quot;Look at the changes that are going on around us. The Middle East is not going forward, but backward.&quot; In practice, Netanyahu adopted a &quot;leave us alone&quot; policy, keeping a low public profile while tacitly supporting the old regional order and occasionally using force to prevent direct security threats. Israel&apos;s military warns of a dangerous deployment of jihadists across the Syrian and Egyptian borders. This month, two cross-border exchanges of fire marked the deteriorating security in the Sinai, but governments in Jerusalem and Cairo pretended it was business as usual. Then, on Monday, Islamists slaughtered 25 unarmed Egyptian policemen in northern Sinai, close to the Israeli border, showing the Egyptian army&apos;s inability to defeat the jihadists. Yet despite the difficulty in pacifying the Sinai, Israel bets on General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, telling Washington to keep its military aid to Egypt intact. Next month Israel will mark the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war, its last military confrontation with Egypt. The 1979 peace treaty, which followed the war, has been the cornerstone of Israel&apos;s regional stance: an alliance with the old dictatorships, preferring their state-centered nationalism over pan-Arab or Islamic ideologies, while always fearing an &quot;Iran next door&quot; scenario. Israel reaped enormous benefits from its peace with Egypt, which allowed it to shrink its ground forces, and now wants Cairo to restore calm and order to Sinai and keep Hamas-ruled Gaza in check. The Egyptian military is seen as a more natural partner to achieve these goals than the Muslim Brotherhood, although the shortlived Morsi presidency kept the peace treaty intact and brokered a ceasefire in Gaza. Netanyahu will not take sides publicly in the Egyptian conflict; he would merely leverage the upheavals across the border to justify the West Bank status quo. Few Israelis challenge his policy and argue that a peace breakthrough with the Palestinians would support the pro-American regimes in the Arab world far more than the current Israeli isolationism. Most would simply hide behind walls and fences, while planning their next vacation in Europe or Thailand. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "publicationDate": "2013-08-20T17:00:00Z", "title": "The Jewish majority in Israel still see their country as 'a villa in the jungle' | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["Few\u00a0Israeli Jews bother to learn Arabic or to immerse themselves in regional culture; cross-border trade is minimal; and the internet has shortened the mental distance from Tel Aviv to New York and Berlin, its cultural beacons."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/jewish-majority-israel-villa-in-the-jungle"}, {"tags": ["Thailand", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Two Iranian men have been convicted by a Thai court for their role in a bomb plot last year that officials believe was an attempt to assassinate Israeli diplomats in Bangkok. Saeid Moradi, 29, whose legs were blown off when a bomb he attempted to throw at police detonated at his feet, was sentenced to life in prison for carrying explosives as well as for attempted murder. Mohammad Kharzei, 43, was jailed for 15 years for possessing explosives. The men were detained after a cache of homemade explosives destroyed the roof of their house in an upscale neighbourhood in of the Thai capital on 14 February last year. Moradi attempted to hail a taxi after fleeing the building, but when the driver refused to stop, he threw a bomb at the vehicle and another at police, injuring himself and five other people. Kharzei fled to Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, where he was arrested while trying to board a flight. The defendants maintained their innocence throughout their trial and insisted that they were unaware of the explosives in their home. Investigators said the DIY explosives found at their property \u2013 which had round, coin-like magnets on them \u2013 were similar to the &quot;sticky&quot; bombs that had been used against Israeli embassy targets in India and Georgia the day before the Bangkok explosion. Neither Moradi nor Kharzei were charged with terrorism or attempted murder, however, and Iran has staunchly denied any involvement in any of the attacks. The attempted bombings in Delhi, Tbilisi and Bangkok followed increasing tensions between Israel, Iran and the west over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons programme after nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari was killed in the Iranian capital by an explosive device stuck to the window of his car by the passenger of a passing motorcycle Two other people survived a similar attack a few miles away the same morning. Iran claimed it was the work of the Israeli intelligence agency the Mossad and later executed a so-called Israeli spy after he allegedly confessed to receiving training in Tel Aviv. The resulting attacks against Israeli targets in India, Georgia and Thailand were widely believed to be retaliatory in nature. A Guardian investigation scoured witness statements, police evidence and court documents, and found the bomb plots to be the work of a co-ordinated group of roughly 12 Iranians, with preparations involving reconnaissance missions, house and transport rentals and target surveillance over a period of at least 10 months. Who orchestrated the attacks remains unclear. Test runs seem to have been carried out as early as April 2011, when five Iranians implicated in the bombings travelled to Thailand and India for reconnaissance. One of them, Leila Rohani, 31, visited Thailand twice in 2012 and rented the Ekkamai house shared by Moradi and Kharzei. Rohani is still at large, having returned to Tehran via Kuala Lumpur. Another Iranian, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, believed to be the mastermind behind the international operation, met Moradi and Kharzei in the Thai beach town of Pattaya and was with them when the house in Bangkok exploded. A day later he fled to Malaysia. In is now detained in prison in Kuala Lumpur, appealing against an extradition order to Thailand over his alleged role in the plot. Moradi, a former factory worker from Tehran, said during his trial that he was carrying the explosives out of his house in order to dispose of them and that he was unaware of their similarity to the bombs used to target Israeli diplomats in Delhi and Tbilisi. Kharzei told the court that he is not a militant but had met Moradi in Tehran airport before they boarded the flight to Thailand in February last year, and had nothing to do with the explosions. Their lawyer, Kittipong Kiattanapoom, said he would ask them if they wanted to appeal against their sentence.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-22T10:17:00Z", "title": "Iranians convicted over Bangkok bomb plot", "sentences": ["Iran claimed it was the work of the Israeli intelligence agency the Mossad and later executed a so-called Israeli spy after he allegedly confessed to receiving training in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/thai-court-convicts-iranians-bomb-plot"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Rising alarm over the potential for the Syrian crisis to spill over into Israel has fuelled a mass scramble for gas masks, with thefts and fistfights breaking out in some of the long queues at distribution centres across the country. Despite efforts by political and military leaders to reassure the public that the chances of retaliation by the Damascus regime against Israel are slight, thousands of people among the 40% of the population still lacking protection kits have flocked to depots over the past few days. A telephone helpline collapsed under the weight of inquiries. One distribution depot in Jerusalem was forced to close after its gas masks were stolen by agitated members of the public. The postal authority, which manages distribution, said in a statement: &quot;People attacked the workers and brutally grabbed gas mask kits.&quot; Fights broke out elsewhere as people waited in line for up to five hours. Gas masks were being offered on eBay for up to $50 (\u00a332) each. Eight hundred schools and 2,800 kindergartens have been ordered to conduct emergency drills by Monday, according to Israeli media reports, and city councils in the Golan Heights and northern Israel are holding defence planning meetings. Tel Aviv city council was considering using underground car parks as mass shelters, saying the majority of existing public shelters were inadequate. Weekend leave for soldiers in the northern command area has been cancelled, the government has authorised a limited callup of around 1,000 reservists, and missile defence systems such as Iron Dome and Patriot have been moved to the north of the country. In the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967, some residents were stocking up on food and water for bomb shelters. Jonathan Bass, a graphic artist in Katzrin, the biggest Israeli settlement in the Golan, said he and his neighbours were &quot;preparing for the unknown&quot;. &quot;People are going to the supermarket to stock up on food and water, and getting their shelters ready. We all have our gas masks. When someone&apos;s put against the wall, there&apos;s usually some kind of retaliation. And the easiest target is us. You just don&apos;t know what a wounded person will do, it&apos;s unpredictable.&quot; In Majdal Shams, where most of the population are Syrians who found themselves on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line drawn after the six-day war, human rights worker Salman Fakhr Eddin said people were tense, not least because many had close family and friends in Syria. &quot;I worry about my friends in Damascus all the time,&quot; he said. Closer to home, some residents were stockpiling food, and explosions caused by an Israeli mine clearance programme were making people jumpy. But he said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe the Syrian regime will retaliate. Assad is against his own people, he&apos;s not interested in fighting the Americans or Israelis.&quot; Although the Golan \u2013 still littered with the detritus of past wars, such as the rusting hulks of tanks and the crumbling houses and mosques of former Syrian villages \u2013 is on the frontline between Israel and Syria, some locals pointed out that any missiles fired on Assad&apos;s orders following US strikes would be likely to shoot over their heads to Israeli cities such as Haifa or even Tel Aviv. &quot;I&apos;m not afraid as a Golan resident because, if at all, the missiles will fly above us. But of course we are upset and concerned, and I think this is a stupid move by the US,&quot; said Chaim Saperia, who has lived in Alonei Habashan, close to the ceasefire line, for 25 years. &quot;In Syria, we&apos;re not dealing with a pro-west side and anti-west side. Both sides hate the west. And attacking Israel is the easiest way for them to respond.&quot; The youngest of his seven children had become accustomed to hearing the sound of fighting a few miles away, he said. &quot;Shelling, automatic munitions, rockets \u2013 it&apos;s part of the melody of our lives.&quot; Behind a display of Golan apples, honey and wine at the Quneitra lookout post less than 40 miles from Damascus, Ora Peretz was unfazed by the possibility of a new escalation in the civil war that has raged close by for the past two and a half years. &quot;I hear and see the bombing every day,&quot; she said from her wooden kiosk, perched between the Red Cross-controlled border below and the satellite dishes and telecommunications masts of an Israeli military base above. &quot;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s coming next, but I&apos;m ready,&quot; she added, saying she had collected her gas mask last year. At Queneitra, normally thronged with tourists, coach arrivals were down to a trickle. A dozen Christian pilgrims from Slovakia photographed nearby Syrian villages as their Israeli tour guide gave them a brief rundown on the civil war. &quot;It&apos;s anyone against everyone. It&apos;s unbelievable. There are no rules. As Israelis we are used to wars, but this is a real tragedy. And they blame Israel for everything,&quot; he said. Most military analysts argued that retaliation against Israel by the Syrian regime was unlikely but could not be ruled out, and that Israel was ready to respond if necessary. Gadi Shamni, a former IDF general and until recently Israel&apos;s military attache in Washington, said a US attack was only a matter of time, but the Syrian response was less certain. The Americans&apos; main problem, he said, was &quot;to find the right dosage for this attack \u2026 that will not scramble the whole Middle East. Assad will react in some way \u2013 he will have to do something to show his people. But attacking Israel would have severe consequences. &quot;He might try to do something symbolic. But anything that hurts Israeli citizens will bring an Israeli response that&apos;s on a different scale [to the US attack]. We don&apos;t have any choice.

The bird, allegedly working for the French government, was captured in a heroic citizen&apos;s arrest by a fisherman who spotted that it was wearing some sort of electronic device. Disappointingly, some actual investigation found it was a tracking device used by French scientists studying the bird&apos;s migration patterns. So much for a bird playing the next James Bond.

Before that, reports in 2007 showed that Iran had arrested 14 spy squirrels; the following year, two pigeons were captured near a uranium enrichment facility.

From 1908, pigeons were fitted with cameras to take aerial photos. Photograph: Boyer/Roger Viollet/Getty    Animal espionage has a hairy history. A German engineer first attached a camera to a pigeon in 1908 to take aerial photographs, which inspired German military intelligence to do the same. Pigeons are still being experimented with \u2013 in 2007, scientists in China reported they had successfully implanted electrodes into the birds&apos; brains in order to fly them like remote-controlled aeroplanes. In the 1960s, the CIA started looking at the possibility of using cats as furry spies, by implanting microphones and transmitters, with the hope that they could be released in and around the Kremlin. Code-named &quot;Acoustic Kitty&quot;, agents planned to test how well the cat worked by getting it to eavesdrop on two men in a park. Unfortunately, the cat was run over by a taxi and the project was abandoned. Or was it?

Rapid growth in air travel means even more people will be visiting them in the future. So where does the world want to visit, do business, or live? Ipsos Mori has surveyed more than 18,000 people in 24 countries, to find out. The most striking finding from the Ipsos Top Cities research is that there are a handful of &quot;superbrand&quot; cities. New York is the clear leader, but London and Paris, in joint second place, do very well indeed, chosen by large numbers of people as places they want to go. But the world&apos;s public don&apos;t just think about America and Europe. The United Arab Emirates may be home to the tiniest fraction of the world&apos;s population, but punches far above its weight in terms of profile, as witnessed by Abu Dhabi&apos;s fourth place as somewhere to visit. Meanwhile, Sydney&apos;s claims to truly be a &quot;world city&quot; are confirmed. It&apos;s clear that the global public is quite discerning and knows the cities well enough to avoid having to make hasty generalisations. New York is the place to make money. Paris is the best place to spend it. But for us, the surprise star is Zurich, which beats all its rivals in being the place the world&apos;s public would most like to live. London receives a global vote of confidence. It is a genuine all-rounder, appearing in the top five for each question, an achievement only matched by New York. If we restrict our focus to the young, it is London, along with New York, which is the most popular place to live for under-35s all over the world. And when we look at the views of the 11 European countries, London is the continent&apos;s most important city. Together with positive signs for the UK economy generally and in the wake of London 2012, this is both a sign for celebration by Boris Johnson and a prompt: what now needs to be done to ensure London continues to punch above its weight? Will all the people who want to move to London be welcomed or even housed? Three hundred miles away from London, Paris will not be too downbeat. The capital of the world&apos;s most visited country is the clear winner as the world&apos;s favourite place to visit, whether respondents are from Argentina, Australia or Canada. But Paris falls down on its reputation as somewhere to do business, and this will surely worry French policy-makers as they debate what needs to happen to get France&apos;s economy moving more quickly. Just 7% see France as one of the world&apos;s top business locations. It is beaten by Washington, a city not normally associated with the commercial world, as well as Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Shanghai. Rome is in a similar position, with just 2% seeing it as a business centre, only a tenth the number who rate it a top place to visit on holiday. At the other end of the spectrum are Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, which perform strongly as places for business, but are not seen as attractive places to live. There are also questions to be asked in those cities which, despite their status, size, history and other attributes, have a relatively low profile, at least when looked at on the world stage. Cities in this cohort include Madrid, Istanbul (fieldwork was conducted before this summer&apos;s protests) and Bangkok. President Putin may be disappointed to see Moscow ranked alongside Brussels, in 31st place \u2013 if he wants more tourists he has lots to do. Finally, there are the cities that are just not popular at all. Tel Aviv, Tehran and Karachi are anchored to the foot of the table, and barely trouble the scorer. Some will be surprised to see Budapest, Casablanca and Warsaw occupying the places just above them. What of the future? Well, this is the first survey Ipsos has conducted of this kind, and we look forward to tracking our cities&apos; progress, perhaps adding a few more (such as Dubai) to the field as well. One thing to watch will be the perspectives of different generations, and how they evolve. At the moment, there is a broad consensus between younger and older people on the best places for business and best to visit. But on the best place to live we have an entirely different pattern: for the world&apos;s 50- to 64-year-olds, it&apos;s Zurich, Sydney and Toronto which occupy the top three places. But among the under-35s, it&apos;s London, New York and Paris. Can London hold on to its top slot as this younger generation get older?

Yet it&apos;s less than three miles from the Western Wall, fully within the municipality of Jerusalem itself. And despite many of Shu&apos;fat&apos;s Arab residents paying their Arnona (property) tax to the Jerusalem municipality \u2013 if they didn&apos;t, they would forfeit their precious blue ID card, allowing them to find jobs in prosperous west Jerusalem and elsewhere \u2013 they get almost no services. This is land that Israel claims for itself, so the Palestinian police cannot operate here. But the Israeli police refuse to enter the camp, so it&apos;s an anarchy zone. Local drug dealers sit in the sun at the entrance, under the gaze of Israeli soldiers who do nothing. The UN runs the schools, collects the rubbish and fights a losing battle to sort out sanitation. The Israelis refuse. It is a place without government, without government services and without much hope. And nobody seems to give a damn. We visit the local secondary school of 2,000 pupils. There is flurry of temporary excitement as a rumour spreads that the water may be running today. It&apos;s a false alarm. There has been no running water in the school for nine months. When we want to visit the loo, the UN man whispers advice: &quot;Pee but don&apos;t poo.&quot; Poo turns out to be a continuous theme of the visit. The camp is surrounded on three sides by the separation barrier, in the valley of a hill on which the camp is set. The hole in the wall for sewage to escape has recently been blocked, creating what the locals call a &quot;shit lake&quot; up against the barrier and causing those the other side of the wall, in the leafy Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze&apos;ev, to complain about the smell. Indeed, the smell of shit is the only reason the settlers of Pisgat Ze&apos;ev come into contact with the humanity of those the other side of the wall, fellow members of the same city, a city that is supposed to be one of the holiest places on earth. To say it again: these are people living perfectly properly and legally in an area Israel claims to be within Israel, yet they are still placed behind a concrete cage. For the last few days, Jews have been celebrating their New Year, Rosh Hashanah. They gather together as families to eat apples dipped in honey and pomegranates. Theologically, this begins a period of penitential soul-searching ending with Yom Kippur. My adopted family in Jerusalem are wonderful, fully engaged with the Palestinian issue and despairing of wider Israeli indifference. But the violin-maker from Tel Aviv is more representative of the Israeli left: &quot;We just put our heads in the sand like ostriches,&quot; he explains. In other words: the situation is too difficult so they give up thinking about it. Understandably, Israelis hate outsiders like me arriving in their country and talking about the conditions in which Palestinians live. But they are the ones who have to live with constant security worries. And the situation is genuinely complex \u2013 especially, perhaps, for Zionists like me. But the wall is not as great a security provider as many assume. It takes under a minute for group of young men to scale it at Shu&apos;fat. Ladders go up one side, a car draws up on the other, also with ladders. In a flash a group of young men are over and speeding off in the car. Thousands do this every day. Only the young, the frail and the elderly are really trapped by the wall. No, what the wall really does is keep the conditions of a place like Shu&apos;fat out of sight and out of mind to the wider Israeli public.

The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, says he will make Iran the focus of a meeting next week with the US president, Barack Obama, and a speech the next day at the UN general assembly, where he drew a red line on a cartoon bomb last year. A statement from Netanyahu&apos;s office described the newly elected president&apos;s remarks about the peaceful aims of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme and his readiness to pursue diplomacy as an exercise in media spin. &quot;The true test is not Rouhani&apos;s words, but rather the deeds of the Iranian regime, which continues to aggressively advance its nuclear programme while Rouhani is giving interviews,&quot; said the response, issued on Thursday after an interview the Iranian president granted to the American network NBC. The statement raised the prospect of a reheating of old disagreements with the Obama administration over the handling of Iran, fuelled by an exchange of letters between Obama and Rouhani and talk in Washington of negotiations that could remove sanctions. Reflecting the Israeli government&apos;s concern that the US and Europe may be wavering, Netanyahu told a meeting of his cabinet last week that &quot;the pressure on Iran must be increased and not relaxed, and certainly not eased&quot;. Netanyahu asserted that Iran must halt all uranium enrichment, remove enriched uranium from the country, dismantle the Fordo nuclear plant and stop &quot;the plutonium track&quot; to a nuclear weapon. Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former adviser to Netanyahu, said: &quot;Right now Rouhani is in the midst of a charm offensive, and there are officials all across the west who feel compelled to respond with hopeful signals about Iranian intentions. &quot;Israel is obviously focused on what actions Iran has taken. The real question is what tangible change you see in Iranian behaviour. We&apos;re not talking about mood music.&quot; Other analysts were similarly sceptical. Rouhani &quot;is really focused on the economic hardship in Iran as a result of sanctions, and that&apos;s why he wants to talk to the US and the international community,&quot; said Emily Landau, director of the arms control programme at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. &quot;He wants to get the sanctions off his back. He has given absolutely no indication that Iran is willing to reverse course on the nuclear issue.&quot; Israeli officials are concerned that in return for an easing of sanctions, Iran could give up part of its nuclear programme while maintaining components that will enable it to move quickly towards building a bomb when it sees fit. Pointing to the recent confrontation with Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons, the officials argue that a credible military threat has to be maintained to press Iran to change course. Even as he pursues diplomacy with Iran, Obama has said the military option remains on the table. But Yuval Steinitz, Israel&apos;s minister for strategic affairs, asserted in an interview published on Friday that such a promise was not enough. Claiming that Iran was six months away from developing a bomb, Steinitz told the right-leaning newspaper Yisrael Hayom that time had run out for negotiations. Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the US and a special envoy for Netanyahu, said that while &quot;officially there&apos;s no space between us and the Americans, we&apos;re more cautious, or perhaps more suspicious&quot;. He added: &quot;With the economic situation in Iran approaching bankruptcy in many respects, if the pressure is working it shouldn&apos;t let up at this crucial point.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-23T08:36:16Z", "title": "Israel sceptical about easing of pressure on Iran to halt nuclear programme", "sentences": ["Rouhani &quot;is really focused on the economic hardship in Iran as a result of sanctions, and that&apos;s why he wants to talk to the US and the international community,&quot; said Emily Landau, director of the arms control programme at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/israel-iran-nuclear-rouhani-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The killing of two Israeli soldiers in the West Bank last weekend has prompted an angry backlash in Israel and led the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to announce he will allow Jewish settlers to enter a disputed house in the tinderbox Palestinian city of Hebron. The latest violence, which follows the killing of four Palestinians in recent weeks during Israeli raids, further raised Israeli-Palestinian tensions at a time when the two sides are in the early stages of recently resumed peace negotiations. On Saturday, the body of an Israeli soldier who had been lured to the West Bank by a Palestinian was found in a well after he had been reported missing by his family. An army statement said that the soldier, Sergeant Tomer Hazan, had worked with the Palestinian in a restaurant in the coastal city of Bat Yam, and had travelled with him by taxi to an Israeli town near the Palestinian&apos;s home village. The Palestinian, identified as Nidal Amar, then persuaded Hazan to accompany him to his village, Beit Amin, and later killed him with the aim of exchanging his body for the release of Amar&apos;s brother, jailed since 2003 for carrying out attacks on Israelis, the army said. Arrested at his home, Amar led investigators to Hazan&apos;s body, concealed in a well north of the village of Siniria. Israeli soldiers are regularly warned to be on alert for possible abduction attempts, which Palestinian militants have warned they could carry out to secure the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier seized and held for five years by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, was released two years ago for more than 1,000 prisoners. Amar was married to an Israeli Arab who lives in the town of Jaljulya, near the border with the West Bank. She told Israel&apos;s Channel Two broadcaster that she hoped he would &quot;get what he deserves&quot; and that she was ashamed of his act. Amar&apos;s father also denounced the killing. In Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, angry protesters demonstrated outside the restaurant where the killer and his victim worked, lighting memorial candles and holding up a sign saying: &quot;Bibi is good for terrorists,&quot; referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. The owner of the restaurant was criticised for employing Amar, who the authorities said had worked in Israel without a permit. On Sunday, another Israeli soldier was killed in Hebron when shots were fired at troops securing the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a hotly contested shrine where both Jews and Muslims pray in strict separation. The shooting followed unrest throughout the city, where there is an increased presence of soldiers and Israeli visitors over the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. In response to the shooting, Netanyahu approved the entry of settlers to a house they claimed they had bought near the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The settlers were evicted from the site last year after the legality of the purchase was called into question, and the case is under review. The economics minister, Naftali Bennet, leader of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party, urged Netanyahu to respond to the soldier&apos;s killing by allowing the settlers back into the house. On Monday, Netanyahu&apos;s office said in a statement that he had ordered &quot;immediate action&quot; to return the settlers to the premises. &quot;Those who try to uproot us from the City of the Patriarchs will achieve the opposite,&quot; Netanyahu was quoted as saying. &quot;We will continue to fight terrorism and strike at terrorists on the one hand and strengthen settlement with the other.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-23T09:27:05Z", "title": "Israeli soldiers' deaths spark protests", "sentences": ["In Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, angry protesters demonstrated outside the restaurant where the killer and his victim worked, lighting memorial candles and holding up a sign saying: &quot;Bibi is good for terrorists,&quot; referring to Netanyahu by his nickname."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/israeli-soldiers-deaths-protests"}, {"tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Zaha Hadid", "Culture"], "article": "Two buildings, one all right angles, the other all curves. One is JW3, a new Jewish community centre in Finchley Road, north London, designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands; the other is the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, the renovation and extension of an 1805 gunpowder store to serve as an annexe to the Serpentine Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid. At \u00a312m and \u00a314.5m respectively, their cost is similar, though JW3 has more than twice the floor area of the gallery. One is about problem solving, the other about creating a problem \u2013 or, to put it another way, raising an ambition. They represent poles, mutually exclusive, of contemporary British architecture. JW3 is the invention of the philanthropist Dame Vivien Duffield, who, inspired by the Jewish Community Centre in Manhattan, thought there should be one in London. In the US such centres are common \u2013 most cities of any size have one, and they can go back a century and a half. They serve Jews but also gentiles, offering such things as swimming pools to the community as a whole. JW3 has a nursery school, a hall for performing arts and events, a cafe and restaurant, a cinema, dance studios, learning centres and a resource centre. It also has a sunken outdoor space which may be used for concerts, ice skating or a temporary farm. A small tower of flats, replacing homes that were formerly on the site, rises at one end. As well as providing facilities, its aims include the encouragement and promotion of Jewish culture, engendering pride and belonging among people who are Jewish, and understanding among those who are not. So the restaurant is a place to eat, but it is also, as the chief executive Nick Viner says, &quot;part of the cultural output&quot;, aiming to show Jewish cooking at its best. You can learn krav maga, a form of Jewish self-defence, or you can do fitness classes of no denomination. This delicate combination \u2013 of belonging to one group but being open to all \u2013 runs through the whole institution. When it comes to architecture, the way chosen to express its identity is to express it hardly at all. &quot;What is Jewish architecture?&quot; asks Alex Lifschutz of Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. &quot;It is no different from any other.&quot; The most that can be said is that this building is descended from the Bauhaus school of design, some of whose leading lights were Jews, some of whom went on to make Tel Aviv a centre of modernist buildings, some of which look a bit like JW3.     JW3's performing arts hall which, like every other part of the building, serves the community as a whole. Photograph: Hufton+Crow    The design is more about bringing together the various parts of the rich brief in a relaxed but coherent whole that allows everything to interconnect and work well. So the cafe and the hall are next to each other and to the outdoor space, such that all work together to form a version of a town square. It&apos;s designed to be open to change \u2013 if necessary, &quot;it would make a very nice office block&quot;, says Lifschutz. Practical challenges, such as the closeness of the brutally busy Finchley Road, had to be met, in this case by setting the building back and putting the outdoor space into a sunken court. Its concrete construction is warmed up by touches of colour and timber and brick on the block of flats. Elements of bronze and brass add quality. Everything is well made and considered and the light is good. It looks like a good 1960s secondary school or library (which, in case you were wondering, is a compliment) that has also benefited from improvements in waterproofing and sustainability in the past half-century. It&apos;s not aiming to be revolutionary but good. We are &quot;using brick as innovatively as we can&quot;, says Lifschutz, but in truth you can only go so far in innovating brick. It&apos;s like attempting radical bread. The weaker moments are when JW3&apos;s crafted efficiency fails to unbend. The nursery feels too much like converted offices, and the outdoor space is rigid and brittle. More pleasure could have been taken in the diversity and contrasts of the brief, but the chosen palette of materials and details doesn&apos;t encourage it. The building is also least inviting when you first see it, when it presents to the street sound-deflecting sheets of glass mitigated by planting, which for now looks uncomfortable. The plants will grow but the place still wants some softness in the construction. Zaha Hadid, meanwhile, says she wants to create something &quot;fantastic&quot;, and almost all the energy of her Serpentine Sackler project is devoted to achieving this aim in one particular place, which is a restaurant and &quot;social space&quot; under a bulging, all white, tent-like roof attached to the old gunpowder store. This interior is indeed extraordinary, an environment of undulation and of layers of brightness into which hollow, light-bearing stalks descend from the ceiling. If JW3 is like a 60s school, this is like something else from the period, a survivor of a forgotten world&apos;s fair \u2013 let&apos;s say an astrophysics pavilion. It&apos;s an instant period piece that is likely to find its greatest fulfilment as a place for parties. Which, with premium rates for events hire, will play an important part in the Serpentine&apos;s business plan.     \u2018The pursuit of the fantastic\u2019: Zaha Hadid\u2019s \u00a314.5m Serpentine Sackler Gallery. Photograph: Luke Hayes    This moment of the &quot;fantastic&quot; comes at a price, however, which is more visible outside than in. The curves, ideally fluent, sometimes grind and stutter round corners, and if the structure is intended to float, to touch the ground lightly, it rather labours and heaves. Too-visible joints let down its aspiration to seamlessness, and the building becomes less convincing when it has to deal with the fact of rain, with drains, stains and stray leaves. And talking of climate, it would be nice if the restaurant had large, openable windows so you might connect with the park outside, but the design doesn&apos;t allow it. In the old building you can&apos;t see the same love and interest that is bestowed on the tent interior. Its conversion into galleries is mostly routine, with a clumsy moment when a new beam crashes oblivious past old work. There is also one of the more bizarre architectural sights of this century, when the futuristic office of Zaha Hadid switches to dutiful, boxy neo-Georgian in order to make a new rear extension match the gunpowder store. There must be better ways of respecting it than this. In other words, if you half-close your eyes, preferably at night-time and with the assistance of lighting, food and drink, and forget all the above imperfections, and suspend the suspicion that it might all be a bit kitsch, you can get a kind of whoosh out of the curvy interior. Whether this whoosh is worth paying more than double the cost per square metre of JW3 is questionable. This is neither the Serpentine Gallery nor Hadid at their best. Together, JW3 and the Serpentine Gallery offer alternatives: you can be sober and responsible or ambitious and extravagant. If, in the comparison of these particular two buildings, the former approach comes off better, at other times it will be reversed. But it&apos;s a false opposition that overlooks the possibility that architecture might operate in more than one register. More, it overlooks the need of buildings to adapt, atmospherically as well as functionally, to the purposes they serve. If Hadid&apos;s pursuit of the fantastic did not entail the subordination of almost everything else, and if Lifschutz could loosen up at the right moments, we&apos;d be on to something really special.", "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T23:05:14Z", "title": "JW3; Serpentine Sackler Gallery \u2013 review", "sentences": ["&quot;It is no different from any other.&quot; The most that can be said is that this building is descended from the Bauhaus school of design, some of whose leading lights were Jews, some of whom went on to make Tel Aviv a centre of modernist buildings, some of which look a bit like JW3."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/29/jw3-serpentine-sackler-gallery-review"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Hassan Rouhani", "Iran", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, vowed to &quot;tell the truth&quot; about Iran&apos;s nuclear programme as he flew to the US on Sunday to meet Barack Obama and address the United Nations. A diplomatic offensive at the UN last week by Iran&apos;s new president, Hassan Rouhani, who had a historic 15-minute phone conversation with Obama on Friday, has raised concerns in Israel, which fears improving relations between the US, one of its closest allies, and Iran, one of its worst enemies. There is concern that if the US eases economic sanctions and removes any military threat, Tehran would be freer to create a nuclear bomb. Officials say Netanyahu will present evidence of continued Iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon, and will urge the US and others not to be taken in by Rouhani&apos;s charm offensive.&quot;I will tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk and offensive of smiles,&quot; Netanyahu said on Saturday night before boarding his plane to New York. &quot;One must talk facts and tell the truth. Telling the truth today is vital for the security and peace of the world and, of course, it is vital for the security of our country.&quot; As Netanyahu travelled to the US, Israel&apos;s Shin Bet domestic security agency announced it had arrested an Iranian with Belgian nationality who was suspected of spying for Tehran. The agency said Ali Mansouri, 58, carried photos of the US embassy in Tel Aviv and had been promised $1m (\u00a3620,000) to set up companies in Israel on behalf of the Iranian intelligence services &quot;to harm Israeli and western interests&quot;. Israeli commentators said Netanyahu would have to work hard to offset the impression left by Rouhani in his UN speech and media appearances, where he presented himself as a peace-seeking moderate. &quot;The Iranian president was very successful in convincing many in the US who want to be convinced that there is a new spirit in Tehran and a great willingness now for compromise. It will be an enormous challenge for Netanyahu to reverse that trend,&quot; said Jonathan Spyer, a senior research fellow at the Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya. In the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, prominent columnist Nahum Barnea wrote that, in his phone conversation with Rouhani, Obama had &quot;folded the flag which Netanyahu had waved to Israelis and the world, the basis of his diplomatic existence&quot;. Barnea added: &quot;The threat of a military attack by the US has been removed, at least in the coming months, and it is doubtful if there ever was an Israeli military threat.&quot; Netanyahu has argued for increased sanctions on Iran, backed by a &quot;credible military threat&quot; that he said proved itself in the case of Syria, which under threat of a US strike agreed to international control of its chemical weapons. The Israeli leader has urged that Iran be pressed to halt all uranium enrichment, remove enriched uranium from the country, dismantle the Fordo nuclear plant and stop &quot;the plutonium track&quot; to a nuclear weapon. Yossi Alpher, an Israeli strategic analyst, said that Netanyahu&apos;s &quot;strident tone&quot;, which included ordering the Israeli UN delegation to walk out of Rouhani&apos;s speech, meant that &quot;he&apos;s coming across as a kind of spoiler&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t think he will be able to persuasively argue that Rouhani is not worth talking to,&quot; Alpher said. &quot;We lose a degree of credibility when we allow ourselves to be totally out of synch with our allies on this issue.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-29T14:16:49Z", "title": "Netanyahu plays hawk to Rouhani's dove with anti-Iran rhetoric", "sentences": ["The agency said Ali Mansouri, 58, carried photos of the US embassy in Tel Aviv and had been promised $1m (\u00a3620,000) to set up companies in Israel on behalf of the Iranian intelligence services &quot;to harm Israeli and western interests&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/netanyahu-rouhani-iran-rhetoric"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "Hassan Rouhani", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "The nauseating effrontery of Michael Herzog&apos;s jeremiad at what he terms &quot;the smile offensive&quot; of Iran&apos;s president, Hassan Rouhani, is breathtaking (Israel can&apos;t trust Iran, 28 September).

Doubtless, were the UN to impose on Israel the kind of sanctions levied on Iran, forcing the regime to comply with international law, we would see a speedy, just resolution to the 65 years of oppression suffered by the Palestinian people.Ian LoweryKensworth, Bedfordshire \u2022\u2008With Iran, it&apos;s not really about nuclear weapons at all.

In 2006 this new approach was adopted to put pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme. The original aim was to focus economic pressure on key individuals and entities, but avoid causing extensive collateral damage to the general population. However, having failed to achieve anything, the sanctions regime has been successively &quot;toughened&quot; (ie expanded). The result is the sort of broad-based economic blockade that everyone agreed long ago to be a bad idea. It would seem that as far as sanctions are concerned what goes around comes around.David SmartAssociate fellow, Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies \u2022\u2008It is difficult to disagree with the logic of Simon Jenkins, but he has overlooked a political dynamic. He says &quot;Israel&apos;s boycott of Iran&apos;s hand of friendship is madness&quot;. Not so. The &quot;existential threat&quot; reinforces US support for Israel and its hostility towards Iran. This leverage is too important to give away. And Israel has probably calculated that a rapprochement led by Obama can be defeated in Congress, especially with its help. To break this dynamic, Britain and Europe need to show willingness to pursue rapprochement without, if need be, the US.David AngluinLiverpool \u2022\u2008Is the Netanyahu who has &quot;vowed to &apos;tell the truth&apos; about Iran&apos;s nuclear programme&quot; (Report, 30 September) the same Netanyahu who refuses to tell the truth about Israel&apos;s huge stockpile of nuclear warheads and the missiles with which to fire them, and who refuses to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty?Gerald Kaufman MPLabour, Manchester Gorton", "publicationDate": "2013-09-30T20:00:02Z", "title": "Letters: Questions of trust for Iran and Israel", "sentences": ["It really is time for Jews worldwide to stand up and be counted: dissociate us from the suicidal impulses that are ever present in Israel.Benedict BirnbergLondon \u2022\u2008Michael Herzog might well be asked: why can&apos;t Iran and most of Israel&apos;s neighbours trust the Tel Aviv regime?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/questions-trust-iran-israel"}, {"tags": ["Cycling", "Women", "Fitness", "Life and style", "London", "UK news", "Transport"], "article": "Don&apos;t hug the kerb, own the road. Never be afraid of being seen, or getting in somebody&apos;s way. And if a car or bus behind you has to wait, they can wait. Those are some of the lessons biking instructor Noam Cohen imparts in sessions aimed at giving female cyclists the skills to stay safe on the road \u2013 and the confidence to get on their bikes in the first place. She taught the two sessions in a new effort called Heels on Wheels, run by bike maker Pitango Bikes. Cohen says that too many women are missing out on the pleasure, convenience and health benefits of cycling. She says she understands why many are wary of riding to work, particularly in urban environments such as London:  &quot;I&apos;ve been cycling for a few years now and I was really timid at the beginning. I was afraid to ride on the main roads. When you don&apos;t ride with confidence, it&apos;s very dangerous. Because you&apos;re afraid to &apos;own the road&apos;, which is one of the main things we teach. Then you&apos;re way more likely to get hurt or to be unseen. And I think for women, our tendency would be to stick to the side, to be unseen, to try to be as close to the side as we can and not to say &apos;I&apos;m here&apos;.&quot;  Cohen&apos;s partner Ilan Harari is one of Pitango&apos;s founders. He says the idea for Heels on Wheels came about as he was chatting with a group of women at the PR firm his company employs. &quot;I was talking to them, and asking them why they don&apos;t ride to work, and they all just said they&apos;re scared, they&apos;re scared of drivers, or roads or various things,&quot; he said. &quot;They feel intimidated.&quot; When the company conducted an informal survey of 100 London women, 67 said they did not own a bike because they were too frightened, and 72 said they would not know how to fix a bicycle. British Cycling is seeking to get 1 million more women on their bikes by 2020. Cohen starts the 90-minute, \u00a330 class with a discussion at Pitango&apos;s Archway warehouse, then leads participants on a ride through both busy roads and quieter side streets. She says she learned her approach from Harari, who developed it in a year spent working as bike messenger on Tel Aviv&apos;s busy streets. Cohen says:  &quot;I don&apos;t think you need to be aggressive, I think you need to be seen. You need to be in the middle [of the road] and not be pushed by vehicles, not be stressed if a cab driver honks at you, which has happened to me in the middle of the night riding. Or if a driver starts shouting at you because he wants to pass fast, you need to wait until you are safe to let him pass.&quot;  &quot;When you don&apos;t have experience, you tend to be very timid,&quot; she adds. Just two women came to the first Heels on Wheels class in early September, but Harari says he hopes the programme will grow. Shir Moaz, 25, says she decided to sign up &quot;basically because I was scared to ride on the roads here&quot; in London. Now, she feels more confident, and is considering cycling to her job as an office manager, a one-hour ride. &quot;Every time I go on my bike now, I&apos;m like, &apos;Ah, remember what she said&apos;,&quot; Moaz said. &quot;I expect more that things will happen, so I know how to react better.&quot; Will Heels on Wheels help convince more women to hop on their bikes? &quot;I hope so,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;It&apos;s such a fun way of commuting.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T10:42:56Z", "title": "The course that teaches female cyclists to 'own the road' | Beth Gardiner", "sentences": ["She says she learned her approach from Harari, who developed it in a year spent working as bike messenger on Tel Aviv&apos;s busy streets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/oct/02/course-female-cyclists-noam-cohen"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "Egypt", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Shimon Peres"], "article": "Resplendent in his gold brocaded black gowns and purple turbans, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who has died aged 93, often resembled a medieval stranger marooned in the modern world. In fact, he was one of Israel&apos;s most astute public operators. As spiritual head of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, Yosef influenced the course of Israeli politics. And as former chief rabbi to Israel&apos;s Sephardim and Mizrachim \u2013 Jews of Iberian, North African and Middle Eastern origin \u2013 he rekindled a sense of communal pride not experienced for centuries. Yosef applied ancient laws to contemporary circumstances. Often he would study until 3am in his booklined three-room flat. Every Sabbath hundreds flocked to a modest Bukharan synagogue in Jerusalem \u2013 the Bukharan Jewish community came from central Asia \u2013 to hear sermons which were beamed around the world by internet. Yet Yosef was also an enigmatic man whose austere public face hid his private charm. He adopted progressive stances which few Israeli rabbis favoured \u2013 such as accepting the Jewish status of Ethiopian Beta Israel, or &quot;Falashas&quot;, in the 1970s, championing peace with the Palestinians in the 1980s and sanctioning organ donations in the 1990s. On the other hand, he often took abstruse, even offensive positions. He lambasted Reform Jews as &quot;destroyers of religion&quot;; claimed that Jewish law forbade men to walk between women; and told President Bill Clinton to &quot;kiss our feet&quot;. In 1999 he repudiated the supreme court after his protege, Aryeh Deri, was jailed for accepting bribes. In 2000 he called Holocaust victims &quot;reincarnated souls of sinners&quot;; later he likened Palestinian and Arab foes to snakes and vipers. In 2010 he said gentiles should serve Jews, he once called Binyamin Netanyahu a &quot;blind she-goat&quot; and this year he dubbed a religious Zionist party as a &quot;home for goyim [non-Jews]&quot;. Yosef was born Abdullah Youssef in Baghdad, Iraq. At four he arrived in British Mandatory Palestine with his parents, Yaakov and Georgia. In Jerusalem he enrolled at Porat Yosef Yeshiva, the leading rabbinical Sephardi seminary. While poverty forced him to study by moonlight, at 18 he wrote the first of his more than 30 books. Ordained a rabbi at 20 and made a religious court judge at 25, in 1944 he married Margalit Fattal, who came from Aleppo, in Syria. Three years later Yosef was appointed chief rabbi of Cairo, just as tensions in Palestine undermined the security of Egypt&apos;s Jewish community. He nonetheless defended Jews&apos; right to statehood. His affection for Egypt was reciprocated 50 years later when Hosni Mubarak afforded him a near-royal reception as Israel&apos;s emissary for peace. Yosef returned to an independent Israel in 1950. In 1968 he became chief rabbi of Tel Aviv, a hedonistic city which the more pious considered little better than Sodom and Gomorrah. Yosef was known for generally lenient rulings when he was Israel&apos;s chief Sephardi rabbi, from 1973 to 1983. In 1974, for instance, he allowed around 1,000 women whose husbands remained missing in action after the 1973 Yom Kippur war to remarry. But it was as spiritual mentor of Shas \u2013 an acronym for &quot;Sephardi Torah Guardians&quot; \u2013 that he truly made his mark. The party began as a municipal list in Jerusalem in 1983. Then Yosef dictated its policies and handpicked its prospective Knesset members, including the 25-year-old Deri, a rabbi and friend of his son, David. Soon Shas blossomed into a national political force that fused religious zeal with an ability to articulate Sephardi grievances. For despite constituting half the population, Sephardim still felt that both Israel&apos;s secular establishment and Ashkenazi-run orthodox parties treated them like second-class citizens. Yosef wooed the less observant. He preached in cinemas, stressed a compassionate social agenda and created a network of 1,800 Shas-run schools and welfare centres in poor neighbourhoods. Yet a generation of Sephardi religion students - including most Shas politicians - still owed primary loyalty to a nonagenarian Lithuanian-born Ashkenazi sage, Rabbi Eliezer Schach. In August 1989 Yosef ruled that Israel should relinquish parts of the biblical &quot;Land of Israel&quot; (located in Palestinian territories), if that could prevent bloodshed and bring lasting peace. Religious settlers immediately attacked his ruling. Undaunted, Yosef and Deri visited Egypt in 1990 to discuss initiatives with Mubarak. In March that year, Yosef ordered Deri to leave the Likud-Labour coalition government, and join a pro-peace Labour alliance led by Shimon Peres. But Schach countermanded Yosef, corralled Shas back into government, and gave a two-year lease of life to the ailing Likud. Yosef displaced Schach as party guru on the eve of the June 1992 elections. Shas&apos;s subsequent entry into Yitzhak Rabin&apos;s coalition government seemed like a &quot;dream ticket&quot;, combining Shas piety with Labour pragmatism. Reality, however, proved different. Shas clashed over education policy with another coalition partner, the secular Meretz party. Investigations into Shas corruption fuelled Sephardi suspicions about prejudice in Israel&apos;s establishment. In September 1993 Shas left the government on the day that Israel signed the historic accords with the PLO. In opposition, Yosef avoided the vilification of Rabin that indirectly led to the latter&apos;s assassination in November 1995. However, he failed to get Shas to endorse Rabin&apos;s successor, Peres, as presidential candidate. Instead most voted for Netanyahu, who went on to win the May 1996 elections. Despite that, Shas gained 10 seats and Yosef persuaded Netanyahu to grant it two key ministries, interior and labour. He offered to meet Yasser Arafat personally, when Netanyahu refused to do so. His dialogue with Palestinian police chief Nasser Yusuf arguably saved lives on both sides. In 1997 Yosef invoked the Talmud to condemn Israeli zealots who usurped Arab property in east Jerusalem. And he threatened to sabotage the government if Netanyahu did not redeploy troops from the occupied territories, as promised in the Oslo agreement. However, in late 1997 Yosef&apos;s dithering nearly sank plans to withdraw Israeli troops from Hebron. In 1998 he opposed reform Jewish converts becoming Israelis. In 1999 he proposed packing the supreme court with rabbis and condemned Russian immigrants as &quot;whores and crypto-Christians&quot;. Israel&apos;s media called it a descent into lunacy. Despite having suffered a heart attack, Yosef was helicoptered to mass rallies across Israel, his face adorned Shas posters and he even won votes from Israeli Arabs, grateful for Shas&apos;s ministerial largesse. In 1999 Shas increased its tally of Knesset seats to 17, two short of Likud itself. Yosef increasingly veered to the right, as did Shas under the political stewardship of Eli Yishai, which left a Labour-led government in 2000. The rabbi opposed Ariel Sharon&apos;s disengagement from Gaza in 2005. That year Israel arrested three Palestinian militants for planning to assassinate Yosef. Nonetheless, he part-inspired the 2011 social protests in Israel. Despite months in hospital, he ensured that one son, Yitzhak, was appointed chief rabbi in June 2013, and apparently thwarted the outgoing chief rabbi, Shlomo Amar, from succeeding him in his guiding role with Shas. The party lost seats in this year&apos;s elections and for the first time other rabbis openly criticised the ailing Yosef. A spokesman for the downtrodden and a champion of faith, or a bigoted autocrat who undermined democracy, and whose political dalliances sullied his religious purity? At least Yosef silenced orthodox Ashkenazim who once had lampooned him and his community. Each of his 11 children either became a rabbi or married one. His eldest daughter, Adina Bar-Shalom, established the Haredi College of Jerusalem. Above all, Yosef reminded Israel&apos;s Sephardi Jews (to quote a Shas slogan) that they came from &quot;generations of sages, not criminals&quot;. Margalit died in 1994; Yosef is survived by 10 of his 11 children. \u2022 Ovadia Yosef, rabbi, born 23 September 1920; died 6 October 2013 \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2013.

There&apos;s much to be said for that second position, but conscious computing offers a third possibility: what if we could harness digital technology to cultivate attention, focus and calm? In my piece, I looked at web-blocking software like Mac Freedom, meditation apps like Rewire, and the fantastic F.lux, which causes a &quot;sunset&quot; on your screen when the real sun sets outside. But it&apos;s a fast-growing field, and plenty more has happened \u2013 or just come to my distracted attention \u2013 since then. Here are a few links worth your time. (Don&apos;t click them if you&apos;re supposed to be focusing on something else!) \u2022 Calm.com is a nicely designed site and app to help you meditate (or just take relaxing pauses from work). Rest is even simpler: a bare-bones Mac app to prompt you to take regular breaks, preferably by getting up. \u2022 How I turned my iPhone into a simple, distraction-free device: a good basic guide to voluntarily limiting your smartphone&apos;s capacities, and what it feels like when you do. Read it alongside 11 ways I&apos;m trying to achieve a sane relationship with the internet. \u2022 I enjoyed this two-part edition of the Buddhist Geeks podcast featuring the creator of ReWire, Mike Redmer: Part One: Rewiring Meditation for the Digital Age and Part Two: Contemplative Technologies. (Buddhist Geeks is also planning a Contemplative Technology Conference in San Francisco next year.) If you&apos;re more interested in the daily challenges of focus than in meditation specifically, read Linda Stone on Maintaining Focus in a Maddeningly Distractive World, an interview by James Fallows. \u2022 Focus @ Will purports to deliver &quot;attention-amplifying music channels scientifically designed to engage with your brain&apos;s limbic system&quot;. I&apos;m not going to attempt to assess the neuro-claims made on the site. But it&apos;s true that there&apos;s a real problem with listening to your iTunes library on shuffle or to Spotify while you work: those songs are likely to be the ones you really enjoy, which isn&apos;t much good if that distracts you from the task at hand. How did Focus @ Will affect my limbic system? I&apos;ve no idea, but the music did seem to help me concentrate a little better.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-09T15:51:15Z", "title": "One button to silence all distractions: the latest in 'conscious computing'", "sentences": ["&quot;When he goes on red in Tel Aviv on his smartphone, we can see in the office in Toronto in real time that he&apos;s on red and we don&apos;t make any effort to contact him.&quot; Obviously, you can&apos;t force a human to obey the red signal."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/oct/09/internet-distractions-one-button-myfocus"}, {"tags": ["Facebook", "Social networking", "Social media", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Internet", "Broadband", "Data and computer security", "Business", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms"], "article": "Facebook has acquired Onavo, a 40-person strong Israeli startup focused on mobile application intelligence, data and compression.

Les Blues beat Finland 3-0 with Franck Rib\u00e9ry and Karim Benzema among the scorers, but they are unlikely to be seeded in the play-off draw which takes place in Zurich on Monday. Russia qualified from Group F by the narrowest of margins after conceding a last-minute equaliser against Azerbaijan. Fabio Capello&apos;s men began the day three points clear of second-placed Portugal and needing a draw in Baku to ensure they would be on the plane to Brazil, but Vagif Javadov&apos;s last-minute strike set nerves fluttering. The visitors held on to leave Portugal, who were comfortable 3-0 winners over Luxembourg, in the play-offs. The match between Israel and Northern Ireland ended 1-1 in Tel Aviv, Steven Davis equalising for the visitors. Flares and fireworks lit up the skies above Sarajevo as Bosnia-Herzegovina won 1-0 in Lithuania to reach the World Cup for the first time. Vedad Ibisevic scored the only goal after 68 minutes to ensure they topped Group G ahead of Greece, who won 2-0 at home to Liechtenstein. Iceland will have another shot at becoming the smallest nation to qualify for a World Cup after taking second place in Group E with a 1-1 draw in Norway. The visitors led through Kolbeinn Sigthorsson&apos;s 13th-minute strike and although Daniel Braaten equalised on the half-hour, the point saw Iceland to reach the playoffs ahead of Slovenia, who lost 1-0 in Switzerland but had already won the group. In Group D, Romania secured a play-off place with a 2-0 victory over Estonia. The Romanians finished ahead of Hungary, who were also 2-0 winners over Andorra. Turkey&apos;s hopes of finishing runners-up ended with a 2-0 loss at home to Holland, for whom Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder scored. The night&apos;s unluckiest side were Denmark, who secured second place in Group B with a 6-0 victory over Malta in Copenhagen but missed out on a play-off berth as they finished with the weakest record of the nine runners-up. Two penalties from Daniel Agger were not enough to keep alive their chances of qualification. Italy, who drew 2-2 at home to Armenia on Tuesday night, topped the group. Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle struck a hat-trick as Sweden and Germany served up another eight-goal thriller in Group C, following the 4-4 draw in Berlin a year ago. Sweden, already assured of a play-off place, went 2-0 up but Sch\u00fcrrle&apos;s treble and goals from Mesut \u00d6zil, who later limped off, and Mario G\u00f6tze ensured Joachim L\u00f6w&apos;s table-toppers rounded off their campaign in style with a 5-3 win. In the same group the Republic of Ireland overturned an early deficit to beat Kazakhstan 3-1 in Dublin, leaving John to O&apos;Shea to hail his side&apos;s &quot;fantastic&quot; response. An own goal, a Robbie Keane penalty and O&apos;Shea&apos;s first international strike in 10 years gave Ireland a welcome victory under interim manager Noel King. &quot;Noel said to us beforehand that whatever happens keep your heads up and play properly,&quot; said O&apos;Shea. &quot;We got the rewards from it and we could have scored even more.&quot; Aaron Ramsey struck a late equaliser for Wales to stun Group A winners Belgium in Brussels and boost Chris Coleman&apos;s hopes of keeping his job.

He has won four World Press awards to date for his coverage of the Middle East conflict, and his acclaimed documentary photographs of war-torn areas around the world have been exhibited in galleries and museums in Europe, the\u00a0US and Israel. This international figure undoubtedly has a unique perspective on the meaning of home, a theme he has explored in depth for his latest project, probably his most personal to\u00a0date. The idea arose in 2008 after the death of his father, who was a\u00a0rabbi and a historian, and who spent his life exploring questions of Jewish identity. Keen to produce a series of photographs that honoured his father&apos;s values, passion and vision, Passow began visiting Jewish communities in London, Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester and many other, smaller British cities and towns with a Jewish presence. He spent a considerable amount of time in these places, in private homes, synagogues, communal spaces and family celebrations, exploring the meaning of home in all its aspects for the British Jewish community today. The resulting black and white photographs are stunning artworks in their own right, which manage to affectionately but unsentimentally document the great range and diversity\u00a0of contemporary Jewish life\u00a0in 21st\u2011century Britain. Originally conceived for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in 2012, nearly 100 photographs from this series have now been published in a\u00a0beautifully produced book, with an excellent introduction by Jonathan\u00a0Freedland. No Place Like Home is a joy to own, best viewed with friends and family around a\u00a0table. Everyone will have an opinion about these photographs, as\u00a0each one seems to promote lengthy discussion, heated debate and much gentle laughter. While there is plenty of visible humour on show, this is clearly a\u00a0serious project, which reveals Passow&apos;s passion for and intimate understanding of the subject.     London 2010, Kiddush following Sabbath morning prayers at a Liberal synagogue. Photograph: Judah Passow    Many of the photographs in the book are anti-stereotypical (in the words of my 12-year-old son), filled with rarely recorded, universally understood private moments in time. Everyone, Jewish or not, will find something familiar here, such as the woman preparing a family meal in her kitchen, or the nurse in conversation with a relative in the corridor of a care home, or the children elbowing their way to the front of a crowded buffet, the police officer questioning a teenage boy on the street about a robbery and the woman holding her head in her hands in a domestic violence shelter. These particular photographs seem to reflect as much about British society today as they do about Britain&apos;s Jewish\u00a0community. Other images in the book portray a distinctive, religiously observant community, immersed in traditional Jewish customs and activities: a\u00a0bearded shochet, poised with meat cleaver in hand, preparing to slaughter a chicken in a kosher abattoir in Luton; an orthodox man wrapped in a tallis pausing for morning prayers, while standing in the doorway of a kitchen in Birmingham; young male yeshiva students in Gateshead poring over the Talmud and an elderly rabbi in full regalia inspecting an etrog for use during the festival of Sukkot in London. These timeless photographs instantly bring to mind Roman Vishniac&apos;s much-loved and widely reproduced A Vanished World project \u2013 a record of Jewish life in the shtetls and villages of eastern Europe in the 1930s. Passow&apos;s images of orthodox life, much like Vishniac&apos;s, serve as visual reminders of the continuity of\u00a0observant Jewish practice. Other photographs examine the cultural life of secular Jews living in the UK today. We see a\u00a0woman playing bridge at a fund-raising tournament in a West End hotel; members of the London Maccabi Lions football team in the changing room after a game; pensioners in deckchairs enjoying the\u00a0sea air, teenagers at a pop concert, and a late-night party in the East End of London for the launch of EasyJet&apos;s new route to Tel Aviv. An\u00a0Israeli flag dominates the background of the latter image and recurs in many other pictures throughout the book, reflecting the deep connection to Israel felt by many British Jews. Other\u00a0photographs, however, reveal the anti-Zionist sentiments felt by some British Jews \u2013 such as the photograph of a Jewish demonstrator from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign\u00a0protesting against\u00a0the launch of the new air route to Tel\u00a0Aviv by writing &quot;Boycott Israel&quot; in\u00a0stones on\u00a0the sand.     London 2010, a sukkah for bankers, lawyers and stockbrokers at Canary Wharf. Photograph: Judah Passow    Passow has also captured the patriotic allegiance to queen and country observed by most British Jews, orthodox and secular alike. One photograph shows a group at a\u00a0Jewish day centre for elderly people, waving union flags while singing &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; at the end of a variety show. In another we see two Jewish ex-servicemen, wearing bowler hats and suits, with remembrance poppies in their lapels, standing proudly on parade in Whitehall. Yet another focuses on a wooden panel hanging on the wall of an orthodox synagogue in London with the prayer for the royal family inscribed on it in English (similar plaques can be seen in synagogues throughout the country). Another, taken in an elderly care home in Brighton, shows a pensioner walking past a framed poster from the second world war (for distribution throughout mandate-controlled Palestine) with a\u00a0photograph of Winston Churchill on it and Hebrew writing beneath, which translates as: &quot;We shall win \u2013 Winston Churchill, the British prime minister.&quot; For me, the most interesting photograph in the whole collection was taken outside the entrance to the orthodox synagogue of my home town of Southend. It shows an oversized Star of David floating against a black background. Standing in front of this most potent of all Jewish symbols is an elderly (you can tell by the hands) man, or woman (you cannot see their face), who has raised his/her sweatshirt over his/her face, presumably in an attempt not to be caught on camera. This perfectly composed photograph is\u00a0an ambiguous image. It seems to show a private, mysterious, closed and out-and-proud community all at the same time. The meaning of any of these photographs cannot be fully grasped in a first viewing. Like the reading of Jewish texts, these images are multi-layered, complex and filled with hidden depths. They demand careful and repeated attention. Each &quot;reading&quot; reveals something new, and each picture seems to ask more questions than it\u00a0answers. \u2022 Rachel Lichtenstein&apos;s Diamond Street: The\u00a0Hidden World of Hatton Garden is published by Hamish Hamilton.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-18T14:00:02Z", "title": "No Place Like Home by Judah Passow \u2013 review", "sentences": ["We see a\u00a0woman playing bridge at a fund-raising tournament in a West End hotel; members of the London Maccabi Lions football team in the changing room after a game; pensioners in deckchairs enjoying the\u00a0sea air, teenagers at a pop concert, and a late-night party in the East End of London for the launch of EasyJet&apos;s new route to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/18/no-place-home-judah-passow-review"}, {"tags": ["Restaurants", "Middle Eastern food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "London", "UK news"], "article": "The winner of our newcomer of the year award almost never happened. &quot;It was meant to be a kebab shop in Brixton,&quot; says Itamar Srulovich, one half of the Israeli husband and wife team behind Honey &amp; Co, the tiny Middle Eastern cafe on London&apos;s Warren Street. He looks around the small, white-walled dining room. &quot;This is all a big mistake.&quot; His wife, Sarit Packer, agrees. &quot;We have become known for our cakes but even those were a mistake,&quot; she says. &quot;We realised there were lots of commuters passing by, so we put things in the window hoping they&apos;d come in.&quot; Let us offer up a prayer of thanks, then, to the gods of happy accidents. In a restaurant world dominated by big ticket launches, Honey &amp; Co is a breath of fresh air. At its heart are the flavours of Israel and the Middle East where Itamar and Sarit grew up and started cooking professionally. It&apos;s about quince salads with mint, honeyed hazelnuts, chilli and fresh curd cheese, deep intense bowls of lamb shawarma on crispy pitta bread or chicken tagine with chestnuts, raisins and date molasses. Most of all there are Sarit&apos;s cakes, including the Fitzrovia bun, their pistachio and cherry take on the curls of the Chelsea bun. The critics, including this one, have all swooned and it has quickly developed a huge fan base. Itamar and Sarit, a glorious double act who finish each other&apos;s sentences, met working in an Italian restaurant in Tel Aviv. Eventually they decided to travel the world but only got as far as London where, exhausted by the effort of finding a flat, they decided to stay. Sarit worked at the Michelin-starred Orrery as a pastry chef, Itamar at the Oxo Tower. Later they both found their way to the empire of Yotam Ottolenghi: Itamar as head chef in the Islington deli restaurant, and Sarit as the executive pastry chef for the group before opening Ottolenghi&apos;s more upscale restaurant Nopi. &apos;Ottolenghi was a chance to get to know customers,&apos; Itamar says. Sarit nods. &apos;In kitchens you are secluded but at Ottolenghi we were able to talk to people and get to know them.&apos; The food they cooked there, they say, wandered far and wide across the world. The food at Honey &amp; Co is, according to Sarit, &quot;just what we cook at home&quot;. The decision to set up on their own was a long term ambition, which became longer and longer as they searched for the right spot. &apos;We were exhausted from hunting for a site when we walked in here. It didn&apos;t look promising. The walls were painted orange and there was a big deli fridge, but we realised it had a good vibe.&apos; As to the name, &quot;we just wanted something associated with sugar,&quot; says Itamar. So is he also involved in the cake side of the business? Sarit snorts with laughter: &quot;No! He has only ever made one cake. But he is a big inspiration for our cakes. He wakes up hungry.&quot; Itamar confirms this is the case. &quot;I wake up wanting things and she has to make them.&quot; Mostly what you get from Itamar and Sarit is a sense of the extreme pleasure they take in what they do. &apos;We&apos;ve been chefs for 15 years,&apos; says Sarit. &apos;To get to a point where you are able to cook your own food and people enjoy it is terrific.&apos; As to the newcomer award it is by turns both &quot;exciting&quot; (Sarit) and &quot;unbelievable&quot; (Itamar). Not that they have time to dwell on such things. A recent bidding war led to a two-book publishing deal. And they have other plans. &quot;We still want to open another restaurant but we only want to do things that are fun,&quot; says Itamar. And Sarit finishes his sentence. &quot;We still want to do our kebab shop.&quot;  Honey &amp; Co, 25a Warren Street, London W1T 5LZ; 020 7388 6175", "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T07:00:00Z", "title": "OFM awards 2013 best newcomer: Honey & Co", "sentences": ["Itamar and Sarit, a glorious double act who finish each other&apos;s sentences, met working in an Italian restaurant in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/20/ofm-best-newcomer-award-honey"}, {"tags": ["Schedule 7", "Law", "UK news"], "article": "A human rights campaigner is taking legal action against the Home Office and a police force for detaining him under anti-terror legislation. Baraa Shiban, who works for the legal charity Reprieve and has spoken out against the UK&apos;s &quot;war on terror&quot;, was travelling to London to speak at an event organised by the thinktank Chatham House when he was detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. The same legislation was used at Heathrow airport in August to detain David Miranda, partner of the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald who has written about mass internet surveillance by the US National Security Agency and Britain&apos;s GCHQ. Leigh Day, the law firm representing Shiban, has written to Sussex police and Theresa May, the home secretary, asserting that he was detained &quot;to intimidate and interrogate him because of his human rights work and criticisms of the UK&apos;s &apos;war on terror&apos;.&quot; They have asked for documents that give information about why he was detained. Reprieve alleges that schedule 7 is being used as part of a campaign of intimidation of human rights workers at UK borders. Other activists say they have also been stopped under schedule 7. Chris Osmond, who campaigns for a corporate boycott of Israel, said he had been stopped twice this year and questioned about his personal life, his work as a researcher for the UK-based research group Corporate Watch and his involvement in G8 protests. Osmond said he was threatened with arrest if he did not answer questions, and was made to hand over a laptop. &quot;Our research [for Corporate Watch] is used by a variety of individuals and social movements to inform action against corporations and for social change,&quot; he said. &quot;The questions being asked of us about our work have serious ramifications for freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The implication is that our work exposing corporate power can in some way be linked to terrorism.&quot; Another activist from Corporate Watch, Jessica Alm, said she was detained and questioned at Luton airport in February after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv following a research trip. Michael Deas, who campaigns for the boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel, said he was stopped at the Eurostar terminal in London and detained for an hour under schedule 7 in December last year by officers who identified themselves as Special Branch. Deas said the line of questioning was &quot;clearly designed&quot; to gather information on leftwing political activity, and that was no reasonable grounds to suspect that he might be engaged in terrorism. Lawyers acting for Shiban have sent a letter to the Metropolitan police and to the home secretary. It says: &quot;Our client was not detained for the purposes of collecting information about terrorism, but instead he was detained and questioned to intimidate and interrogate him because of his human rights work and criticisms of the UK&apos;s &apos;war on terror&apos;.&quot; The lawyers claim that Shiban&apos;s detention under schedule 7 violated his fundamental rights, and are seeking confirmation that it was unlawful. They are claiming damages and demanding copies of all documents regarding the decision to detain him. A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;Schedule 7 forms an essential part of the UK&apos;s security arrangements \u2013 it is for the police to decide when it is necessary and proportionate to use these powers.&quot; A Sussex police spokesman said the force was &quot;satisfied our actions were legitimate, justified and proportionate and were carried out in accordance with the act&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-30T18:17:09Z", "title": "Reprieve activist seeks damages over schedule 7 detention", "sentences": ["The implication is that our work exposing corporate power can in some way be linked to terrorism.&quot; Another activist from Corporate Watch, Jessica Alm, said she was detained and questioned at Luton airport in February after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv following a research trip."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/oct/30/reprieve-activist-schedule-7-detention"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Anglicanism", "Christianity", "Religion", "London", "UK news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "This week the Israeli government announced final approval for 1,500 new apartments in East Jerusalem. Much of the rest of the world \u2013 even the US \u2013 complains vigorously about all this highly contentious settlement building. But it makes little difference. Israel doesn&apos;t listen. It just keeps on doing its own thing, indifferent to the calls of the international community. The impression given is that Israel doesn&apos;t give two hoots what anybody else thinks. It is, claims French academic Diana Pinto in a recent book, a form of national autism. Back in 2009, French Europe minister Pierre Lellouche called British foreign policy &quot;autistic&quot; for being introverted and self-absorbed. But Pinto&apos;s claim is different. She doesn&apos;t mean it as an insult \u2013 either to Israel or to sufferers from autism (though both may take it that way). Her argument begins by noting that Israel is brilliant scientifically and technologically. Amazingly, for so tiny a place, it has more companies listed on the Nasdaq, the hi-tech stock market, than all of Europe combined. This start-up revolution has, she insists, replaced the kibbutz as Israel&apos;s &quot;conceptual motor&quot;. Israel works fantastically well in cyberspace. Perhaps it always has. Zionism, until very recently, has long been a dream, a sort of virtual reality. Those who have, for centuries, been hounded as aliens in other people&apos;s lands, might have learnt to live more freely in the imagination than in the harsh reality of poverty and pogroms. But the flip side of all this prodigy-like technological mastery is a lack of empathy, an inability to meet the gaze or to enter into the emotional reality of its neighbours. In this Rain Man caricature, Israel lives in an existential bubble, cut off (by a wall, both mental and literal) from its surroundings. Walking down the Tel Aviv boardwalk you could be forgiven for thinking you are in Santa Monica rather than the Middle East. This introversion Pinto links with Judaism&apos;s lack of interest in religious conversion. &quot;Any attempt to convert others implies finding the best way to interact with them by penetrating into their deepest values and symbols \u2026 in brief, dialoguing. Autistic personalities rarely dialogue.&quot; In other words, Israel lives in its own little cyberspace, a loner that doesn&apos;t play well with other people. In order to make some sense of Pinto&apos;s claim I went online and took an autism test, developed by Professor Simon Baron-Cohen at Cambridge University, imagining myself answering the questions as though I was Israel itself. This shows how curious Pinto&apos;s whole argument is. Questions about one&apos;s ability to remember dates and phone numbers, or fascination with patterns and categorisation, or desire for routine may suggest autism in a person but how does one answer as a country as a whole? I contacted Baron-Cohen to ask him what he thought. &quot;I find it unhelpful to use a psychiatric diagnostic term as a metaphor,&quot; he sensibly responded. &quot;Unlike the neurological and genetic condition of autism, much of Israel&apos;s behaviour can be seen as a reaction to living in war conditions for much of its history.&quot; He goes on: &quot;I could imagine a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians one day, and this will be because some basis of trust has been established between the two communities. If I&apos;m right, then the idea that Israel has autism is even more absurd, since autism doesn&apos;t just vanish when trust is established. For those who actually have autism, it is a lifelong state of being.&quot; So here then is the real problem with\u00a0Pinto&apos;s metaphor. It is fatalistic, without the possibility of change. History teaches the current situation cannot be permanent. One day, surely, the walls will fall.

The numbers of those protesting in central London were swelled by a gathering on Westminster Bridge organised by the People&apos;s Assembly, an anti-cuts umbrella group whose &quot;Bonfire of Austerity&quot; was addressed by the Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Jon McDonnell. In the US, protesters in Washington DC gathered at the Washington Monument before walking to the White House to raise awareness of causes including opposition to mass surveillance and genetically modified foods. Other protests, of varying size, took place in cities including Vancouver, Tel Aviv, Dublin, Paris, Chicago and Sydney. One of a number of Facebook pages for the event described it as a &quot;Call for Anonymous, WikiLeaks, the Pirate Party, Occupy and Oath Keepers to defend humanity&quot;. &quot;Remember who your enemies are: billionaires who own banks and corporations who corrupt politicians who enslave the people in injustice,&quot; it added.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T08:20:00Z", "title": "Protesters gather around the world for Million Mask March", "sentences": ["Other protests, of varying size, took place in cities including Vancouver, Tel Aviv, Dublin, Paris, Chicago and Sydney."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/protesters-gather-million-mask-march"}, {"tags": ["Dance music", "Music", "Dubstep", "Clubbing", "Culture"], "article": "If at some point this summer you danced in a field surrounded by people in UV paint pointing ecstatically at screensaver visuals, chances are the DJ on stage was Dutch. Ti\u00ebsto, Afrojack, Hardwell, Armin van Buuren \u2013 these DJs and producers are the backbone of the global EDM industry, commanding crowds of thousands by blending the twinkling trance they pioneered a decade ago with the thrilling asymmetry of dubstep. Away from this fluorescent kitsch, however, lurks an underground Dutch scene that is even stronger than ever, with as many as eight dance music festivals in a single weekend in Amsterdam. The one I visit is Dekmantel, held in a giant woodland clearing on the city&apos;s border, and there&apos;s a bold shaft of daylight between the music being played here (subtle shifts of mood, a strong narrative thread pumping through it) and Ti\u00ebsto&apos;s blandly utopian oeuvre of predictable builds and drops. Tom Trago&apos;s afternoon disco set is floozily fabulous, the Amsterdam native chucking on crowdpleasers such as Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King while wearing a child&apos;s party hat on his bald head. Less than eight hours previously he had been behind the decks of Trouw, a club at the heart of the scene (Amsterdam&apos;s mayor spun the first record at its recent reopening).     Tom Trago. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    &quot;There&apos;s a tsunami of new people coming up,&quot; he says, dragging excitedly on a joint after he comes offstage. &quot;There&apos;s a positive development going on in young kids, and their consciousness about what is good or not. Kids are punky \u2013 at 17, 18, 19, they say no, I&apos;m not going to just do what this other guy is doing.&quot; His Voyage Direct series of releases champions this new generation, featuring local producers such as Awanto 3, Maxi Mill and Dexter who make melodic, probing house music. These, as well as his own tracks \u2013 including the ones on new album The Light Fantastic \u2013 show the tree-ring growth outward from the core of Chicago house and Detroit techno that arrived at Amsterdam clubs such as The Roxy in the early 90s. &quot;Back then, it was much more like a typical harbour,&quot; says another local producer, San Proper, leisurely accepting the joint from Trago. &quot;People had the information, but they didn&apos;t really own it.&quot; In other words, they aped the imports of the American and UK scenes, with labels such as Bunker and Outland driving the first wave of Dutch underground dance. &quot;Maybe the 909s were really cheap,&quot; wonders Trago as to its popularity. &quot;The ecstasy was good too. But that was all before we were born, of course!&quot; he laughs.      The arrival of Rush Hour, a label, shop and party promoter team, cohered the scene further. &quot;House, Detroit techno, disco \u2013 we really got into that as a result of Rush Hour,&quot; says Thomas Martojo, one of the three founders of Dekmantel, which has grown from club nights for 100 friends to festivals for thousands, plus a record label of their own. &quot;Rush Hour has a massive influence on the people who are buying records.&quot; It was also important for Juju and Jordash, the Israeli duo Gal Aner and Jordan Czamanski, who make jazz-inflected techno and moved to Amsterdam seven years ago. &quot;It definitely played a role,&quot; says Czamanski. &quot;All the parties when we moved here were Rush Hour stuff.&quot; The city seemed impossibly fertile for the pair, coming from techno-starved Tel Aviv and Haifa where, as Aner drily notes in a nod to his partner, &quot;Jordan was the scene.&quot;     The Dekmantel soundsystem. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    &quot;Amsterdam is the complete opposite of Tel Aviv \u2013 life doesn&apos;t necessarily mean struggle here,&quot; continues Czamanski. &quot;Tel Aviv is a happening city, but politically it&apos;s very tense and stressful. There were one or two clubs that brought DJs we were into, and that was every few months, unless it was cancelled because there was a bomb on a bus. And then moving to a place like Amsterdam where every week there was something different going on, it influenced our music.&quot; The difference between now and the past is that, as San Proper says, &quot;there&apos;s an identity to it now \u2013 people are claiming something. People are saying there is a Dutch sound. Me, I can&apos;t distinguish it at all.&quot; &quot;There is no Dutch sound!&quot; Trago explodes in agreement. &quot;There&apos;s too much shit going on to give one identity to it.&quot; And this, paradoxically, is what defines the scene: a plurality between genres that London has been slouching towards, but which techno-centric Berlin absolutely rejects. &quot;In London you can be doing dubstep nights, year long, every weekend, but here there&apos;s just one dubstep night and it probably plays some hip-hop too. Everything falls into each other,&quot; says Trago, with Martojo agreeing: &quot;You&apos;re not a techno guy or a disco guy or a drum&apos;n&apos;bass guy \u2013 everyone visits everyone else&apos;s parties.&quot;     Legowelt and Xosar at Dekmantel. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    Their working methods are varied too \u2013 whereas Trago primarily uses one piece of equipment, the Akai MPC2000XL sampler and drum machine (&quot;the Japanese guy who invented this shit, I want to be at his funeral \u2013 this machine changed my life&quot;), Juju and Jordash use analogue synths and jam for 40 minutes at a time to generate a single idea. When performing live, they frequently improvise. Falling between the two are Legowelt and Xosar, lovers and collaborators who each work on their own cosmic takes on house. Where Xosar (US expat Sheela Rahman) mostly uses Korg&apos;s Electribe unit to make tracks, Legowelt (The Hague resident Danny Wolfers) has a love affair with vintage synths that has got massively out of hand. &quot;It&apos;s disgusting, it&apos;s perverse \u2013 he&apos;s addicted to synthesisers like a crackhead,&quot; says Rahman. &quot;They&apos;re oozing out of closets \u2013 any drawer you open up you find drum machines.&quot; &quot;The kitchen and the bathroom, those are the only rooms that don&apos;t have synthesisers in,&quot; Wolfers admits. &quot;In our house we can make music anywhere we want \u2013 I can attach a synthesiser in the garden.&quot; Their tracks are transcendent pilgrimages through electronic sound, &quot;trying to subliminally relay the message of our intention to help humanity raise its consciousness levels,&quot; as Rahman says. &quot;For advancement of the human population, [to remind them] to not be pedestrian,&quot; continues Wolfers. &quot;And to just be freaky.&quot; For them, too, this is a scene that is absolutely not nationalistic, thanks to the global village online. &quot;It&apos;s cyberpunk, information overload, but we can pick the good things out of it,&quot; says Wolfers of the new dance pluralism. &quot;In the 90s in The Hague you had the scene around [producer and DJ] I-F: raw electro and raw acid that went into techno, and it was very, very local. Even Utrecht had their own house scene. But nowadays it&apos;s international.&quot; Rahman chimes in: &quot;When I was living in Los Angeles, it was more to do with a scene as opposed to the actual music, that jugular feeling of energy and power. But there&apos;s a lot more emphasis placed on those feelings here.&quot; Looking out on the crowd at Dekmantel, identical in ponchos and cutting shapes through the dry ice and rain, you can see what she means.

The arrival of Kerry, Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, and his French and German counterparts, Laurent Fabius and Guido Westerwelle, has further boosted anticipation that a deal is within reach. On Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced that drafting of a joint statement would start on Friday morning and could be completed by the end of the day. &quot;I have come personally to Geneva because these are negotiations that are difficult but important for the regional and international security,&quot; Fabius said on arrival in Switzerland. &quot;It is a question of reaching an agreement which represents a first solid step in addresses the international concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme. There has been a lot of progress but so far nothing has been finalised.&quot; Kerry flew to Geneva from Israel, where he discussed the outline of the deal with Binyamin Netanyahu at a meeting at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. The Israeli prime minister is reported to have restated his opposition to any partial agreement that lifts any sanctions without a complete halt to Iranian uranium enrichment. According to the Haaretz website, he told Kerry Israel would not be bound by any agreement struck in Geneva. On Friday morning over breakfast, the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who is co-ordinating the Geneva talks, met senior diplomats from the six nations involved in the long-running negotiations with Iran \u2013 the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2013 to discuss positions before beginning the work of drafting an agreement. The US state department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a statement as Kerry took off from Israel saying: &quot;In an effort to help narrow the differences in negotiations, Secretary Kerry will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, today at the invitation of EU high representative Ashton to hold a trilateral meeting with high representative Ashton and foreign minister Zarif on the margins of the \u2026 negotiations.&quot; Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Zarif said the agreement could be finished by the end of Friday, but that much would rely on the contribution of western diplomats. &quot;Depending on what they put on paper with us, we can decide whether it&apos;s a major deal or a small step in the right direction. I hope it&apos;s more than a small step in the right direction, but I&apos;ll be happy if we move in the right direction,&quot; Zarif said in his only interview with a British newspaper. He said the process of drafting would begin at a meeting with Ashton, which Kerry is expected to join. &quot;I believe the ingredients are there. I believe there is a general understanding of everyone involved, but it is important at the same time to start doing things in black and white and try to move forward with the text,&quot; Zarif said. To coincide with the climactic point in the talks, Iran launched a sophisticated new website to put the case for its nuclear programme, rebutting allegations that it is a front for eventually making weapons and laying out the energy, environmental, health and agricultural reasons for its development. Western officials agreed that drafting work could begin on Friday, but cautioned that there were still many difficult issues to resolve. Any agreement would represent a historic breakthrough after a decade of diplomatic sparring marked by paralysis and distrust. Zarif said the six other nations represented in Geneva had agreed with an Iranian plan to move the negotiations forward \u2013 a statement of intent encompassing an initial confidence-building measure and an outline of the end goal of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme and a normalisation of relations between Tehran and the west. The foreign minister said the negotiations had gone further in the first day than merely agreeing a framework. &quot;We have gone beyond that and we have agreed on the elements that have to be incorporated in each one of these [steps]. The manner in which we incorporate them and the balance we strike between these elements \u2013 that&apos;s the sort of questions we have to answer tomorrow,&quot; he had said. It is widely expected that both an interim deal and a longer-term settlement would involve western acceptance of Iran&apos;s enrichment programme in return for Iranian acceptance of limits on its scope, particularly a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium of about 5%, sufficient for fuel for nuclear power stations. There would also have to be an agreement on how far Iran could go in developing a heavy-water reactor at Arak which would produce plutonium, as well as on Iranian acceptance of extensive and intrusive inspections by the international watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the negotiations got under way in Geneva, Netanyahu had referred to the emerging deal as &quot;a mistake of historic proportions&quot;. Asked about the Israeli prime minister&apos;s comments, Zarif said: &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s an authority on mistakes because he&apos;s been making mistakes for his entire life. He&apos;s been calling the Iranian programme six months away from a nuclear weapon since 1991, so I don&apos;t consider him a credible authority.&quot; As to the reception a nuclear bargain is likely to receive back in Iran, the foreign minister said: &quot;It depends on the type of deal that we get.&quot; &quot;The Iranian public is very sceptical about the process and I believe rightly so because we haven&apos;t had a very positive experience in the past,&quot; Zarif said. &quot;What is important is to prepare a solid agreement that all sides can be happy with and all sides can sell to their populations. For Iran because it&apos;s our right. It&apos;s our programme, it is important that it is respectful and it is based on equal footing and I believe we can sell it to the public. If we can&apos;t I don&apos;t think we should agree to it.&quot; In Tehran, Ayatollah Movahedi Kermani used his address at Friday prayers to warn that any deal struck in Geneva between Iran and the west would be detrimental for the Islamic republic. &quot;It&apos;s harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing other than playing tricks. Our enemy would not rest even for a moment. If we underestimate the enemy we will definitely get hurt,&quot; he told crowds in Tehran. &quot;The US secretary of state has pledged Netanyahu that he will not do a bad deal with Iran. It means that they will not agree to an agreement which is harmful for them which means they will not make a good deal with Iran.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think the talks will bear fruit. They are not going to stop their enmity with us,&quot; he said.- Zarif is not the only participant in the Geneva talks likely to face resistance back home. In Washington on Thursday, the US Senate said it would move ahead with a debate on tough new sanctions on Iran after the Geneva meeting was over. Some senators have said they would consider loosening the sanctions regime, but only in return for significant concessions from Tehran. In another sign of progress on Thursday, Zarif said the head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, would visit Tehran on Monday, raising expectations of a breakthrough in long-running talks between the Iranian government and the agency aimed at clearing up uncertainty over Iran&apos;s past development work on nuclear weapons. Zarif said: &quot;Mr Amano&apos;s visit is going to be an important indication that we are in process in moving forward.&quot; His optimistic remarks followed a full meeting of all the delegates and separate discussions between Iranian officials and diplomats from the US, Russia and China, and talks with the three European states represented \u2013 the UK, France and Germany. British and Iranian diplomats discussed the eventual appointment of non-resident charges d&apos;affaires in each other&apos;s countries. Zarif had cancelled a trip to Rome so that he could hold a face-to-face meeting with Ashton as it became clear that substantial progress was being made.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T10:20:18Z", "title": "John Kerry to join Iran nuclear talks to 'narrow differences'", "sentences": ["There has been a lot of progress but so far nothing has been finalised.&quot; Kerry flew to Geneva from Israel, where he discussed the outline of the deal with Binyamin Netanyahu at a meeting at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/john-kerry-iran-nuclear-talks-us-sanctions"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "John Kerry", "Obama administration", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Saudi Arabia", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel"], "article": "Hardliners in Tehran, hawks in Tel Aviv and Washington, nervous Saudis and their Gulf allies are all alarmed at the prospect of a nuclear deal between Iran, the US and the international community. Initial reactions from conservative opponents of President Hassan Rouhani have been predictably critical - with warnings that all sanctions had to be lifted and Iran&apos;s right to uranium enrichment recognised before confidence-building measures could proceed. So were the openly angry words from the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, still hinting at a unilateral strike on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities. The agreement reached in Switzerland was, he warned, &quot;the deal of the century&quot; for the Islamic Republic. But Israel \u2013 with its own undeclared atomic arsenal \u2013 would not be bound by it. In the US, suspicions look likely to harden on Capitol Hill as the crucial details of the Geneva agreement, and especially any relief from sanctions, become clear. The White House has already had to urge Congress not to tie its hands in the talks with Iran. Saudi Arabia, which has dramatically demonstrated its chagrin at Barack Obama&apos;s policies towards both Iran and Syria, kept silent on Friday. But no one has forgotten \u2013 thanks to WikiLeaks \u2013 King Abdullah&apos;s famous call to &quot;cut off the head of the snake&quot; in Tehran. Warnings this week that the kingdom may acquire its own nuclear weapons from Pakistan were a reminder \u2013 perhaps a deliberate one \u2013 of the high stakes being played for in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates is also likely to be deeply unhappy about the beginning of a rapprochement between its powerful regional rival and traditional protector. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, who was putting the finishing touches to the P5 + 1 agreement in Geneva, has already had to reassure the Gulf states, as well as Jordan and Egypt, that America will not allow them to be targeted by Iran. Bahrain, with its restive and repressed Shia majority, worries in particular about this. Tehran, warned one influential Gulf commentator, could interpret a nuclear agreement as &quot;American acquiescence in Iranian meddling in their allies affairs&quot;. Opposition everywhere should, however, be tempered by the fact that the emerging deal looks likely to be phased, limited and reversible, offering partial relief from crippling sanctions in return for verifiable progress on international monitoring of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. In the Islamic Republic, the key to momentum will be sufficiently tangible economic improvements to build up the popular support Rouhani needs to bolster his position vis-a-vis diehard conservatives and the Revolutionary Guards, imbued with decades of suspicion towards the US, the west and their Arab allies. The continuing confrontation over the war in Syria, where Tehran and Lebanon&apos;s Hezbollah back Bashar al-Assad to the hilt while the Saudis support the Sunni rebels, has been a vivid reminder of Iran&apos;s regional reach and influence. For the moment though, Rouhani appears to enjoy the backing of Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has urged critics &quot;not to consider our negotiators as compromisers&quot;. Israel&apos;s ill-tempered opposition \u2013 even before anything has been formally agreed \u2013 looks set to further strain its already tense relations with Washignton. &quot;Netanyahu unwise to challenge US so openly/dismissively on possible Iran nuclear deal,&quot; tweeted Nicholas Burns, a former senior US diplomat. &quot;Netanyahu&apos;s outburst was a serious tactical error.&quot; The Israeli prime minister has taken a hard line on this issue for years, so it is no surprise he is taking the news badly. It is still hard to imagine, however, that Israel would attack Iran \u2013 even if it has the military capability to do so alone \u2013 while a prolonged and internationally backed agreement is in place.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T15:36:24Z", "title": "Hawks squawk even before Iran nuclear deal is sealed", "sentences": ["Hardliners in Tehran, hawks in Tel Aviv and Washington, nervous Saudis and their Gulf allies are all alarmed at the prospect of a nuclear deal between Iran, the US and the international community."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/hawks-iran-nuclear-deal-us-israel-middle-east"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Hassan Rouhani", "Nuclear weapons", "Lady Ashton", "Politics", "European Union", "John Kerry", "US foreign policy", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"], "article": "From his room in Geneva&apos;s InterContinental hotel on Friday morning, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, could take in the sweeping view of Mont Blanc looming over Lake Geneva before an intensive day of diplomacy with his US and European counterparts. Many would take in this idyllic vista and think of skiing and hiking, but for Iran&apos;s most senior diplomat it might well suggest the &quot;mountain of challenges&quot; \u2013 as the Persian idiom has it \u2013 that he and President Hassan Rouhani face back home. As Zarif met the EU&apos;s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and prepared to shake the hands of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, hardliners in Tehran made clear they were still opposed to the United States and feared any prospect of an agreement in Geneva. &quot;Death to America,&quot; chanted crowds sympathetic to the elite Revolutionary Guards and its voluntary Basij militia gathered at Tehran University in the centre of the city for Friday prayers. The Geneva talks were held on Thursday and Friday, the Iranian weekend, which is likely to have reduced the public backlash in Iran, but still the hardliners made their voices heard. The leader of Tehran&apos;s Friday prayers, Ayatollah Ali Movahedi Kermani, said in remarks broadcast live on national radio that any deal with the west would be detrimental to Iran. &quot;It&apos;s harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing but play tricks,&quot; Kermani said. &quot;Our enemy would not rest even for a moment. If we underestimate the enemy, we will definitely get hurt.&quot; The imam was particularly critical of assurances Kerry gave to Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, before leaving Tel Aviv for Geneva. &quot;The US secretary of state has promised Netanyahu that he will not do a bad deal with Iran,&quot; he said. &quot;This means that they will not agree to anything that is harmful for them \u2013 which means they will not make a good deal with Iran.&quot; Reflecting remarks this week by Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has said that he is not optimistic about the talks, Kermani said: &quot;I don&apos;t think the talks will bear fruit. They [the enemy] are not going to stop their hostility towards us.&quot; Despite Kermani&apos;s warning, Rouhani&apos;s diplomacy appears to have the support of Khamenei, who has ultimate power in all state matters. Khamenei has criticised those who labelled Iran&apos;s nuclear negotiators &quot;compromisers&quot;, warning that they had a difficult mission and no one should &quot;weaken an official who is busy with work&quot;. Iran&apos;s conservative-dominated parliament has so far been silent about the trajectory of the talks, although a group of MPs criticised Rouhani&apos;s team for keeping the details of a possible accord secret from the public and called them to parliament for questioning. Others said it was necessary the talks remained secret at this stage. On Friday, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, signalled his approval of the Geneva talks. He told the Isna news agency that the ground had been prepared for an agreement that would ease western sanctions and that it was compatible with Iran&apos;s national interests. Khamenei&apos;s backing of Zarif&apos;s team means many of the more hawkish fundamentalists have refrained from criticising the new government&apos;s diplomacy directly. Instead, they have warned against giving in to the west&apos;s demands. Before Rouhani&apos;s largely successful visit to the UN in New York in September, Khamenei gave him more authority by talking of &quot;heroic flexibility&quot;. That visit brought a historic phone conversation between Rouhani and Barack Obama, the first direct talks between Iranian and US leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution. &quot;Khamenei himself is also under lots of pressure,&quot; an Iranian analyst said, asking not to be identified. &quot;The hardliners in the Revolutionary Guards are surrounding him all the time and sabotaging Rouhani&apos;s diplomacy by injecting scepticism about Americans and their intentions.&quot; As Rouhani passes his first 100 days in office, he can claim credit for a number of election promises that have been fulfilled. A number of leading activists have been released from prison and Tehran has taken serious steps to improve ties with the west, not least breaking the 34-year taboo of talking directly to the US at the highest level. A Tehran University professor, Sadegh Zibakalam, said by telephone that he anticipated a historic moment in Iran&apos;s relationship with the west. &quot;We didn&apos;t expect this, but it seems that Rouhani&apos;s &apos;key&apos; is opening many doors and a historic agreement may be under way,&quot; he said, referring to the key Rouhani adopted as the symbol of his election campaign. &quot;We don&apos;t know much about the details of this possible deal but to me what&apos;s important is that for the first time in 35 years since the 1979 Islamic republic, it appears Iran and the west are trusting each other despite sabotage by hardliners in Iran, in Washington or Tel Aviv. For the first time, it seems Iran has trusted the US and Europe&apos;s words that they are not seeking regime change and that the sole issue here is the nuclear programme. The west, on the other hand, seems to have taken Iran&apos;s word that it will open the doors to IAEA inspectors and have nothing to hide.&quot; Zibakalam said hardliners in Tehran were driven by rivalry with Rouhani&apos;s moderate administration. &quot;It is partly true that in general, hardliners don&apos;t want the Rouhani team to succeed. &quot;They are even ready to sacrifice national interests for their political gains and internal rivalry,&quot; he said. &quot;There is also a third group of people who really don&apos;t believe we should have any sort of dialogue or relations with the west.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T19:39:52Z", "title": "Rouhani's diplomatic progress in Geneva keeps Iran's hardliners at bay", "sentences": ["If we underestimate the enemy, we will definitely get hurt.&quot; The imam was particularly critical of assurances Kerry gave to Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, before leaving Tel Aviv for Geneva.", "&quot;We don&apos;t know much about the details of this possible deal but to me what&apos;s important is that for the first time in 35 years since the 1979 Islamic republic, it appears Iran and the west are trusting each other despite sabotage by hardliners in Iran, in Washington or Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-talks-diplomatic-progress-geneva-hardliners"}, {"tags": ["Baz Luhrmann", "Guillermo del Toro", "Terence Davies", "DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "Nothing about F Scott Fizgerald&apos;s The Great Gatsby feels especially festive: it&apos;s all critical despair in stifling summer air, chilled mint juleps and crisp linen suits. Baz Luhrmann&apos;s The Great Gatsby (Warner, 12) is another matter: this luxurious pudding seems more at home in the run-up to Christmas (when it was originally slated for release in cinemas) than it did back in May. That may be because Luhrmann has never met a bauble, sparkler or strand of tinsel he didn&apos;t like: like all his films, this Gatsby is dressed and decorated to scrumptious excess. Critics trotting out the tired &quot;style over substance&quot; epithet were missing the point. Style is substance in Luhrmann&apos;s universe, and as such, the film is rather effective in capturing the beautiful but damned hollowness of Fitzgerald&apos;s jazz age; it&apos;s the film Jay Gatsby might have naively made of his own wasted life. If it&apos;s less successful in summoning the novel&apos;s moral authority, that&apos;s because everyone involved is clearly having far too good a time. Accept it as a blinged-out totem to a classic rather than an adaptation thereof, and you will too. Needless to say, the Blu-ray comes bloated with extras of variable interest and necessity: unsurprisingly, a token feature on Fitzgerald&apos;s life and legacy is executed with less conviction than an exhaustive five-part dissection of Luhrmann&apos;s most ambitious set pieces in the film. Rivalling Gatsby for iridescent gaudiness is Guillermo del Toro&apos;s Pacific Rim (Warner, 12), state-of-the-art trash that demonstrates just how hard it is to honour the cheap and cheerful charms of vintage monster cinema on a budget of \u00a3118m. Much was made in Hollywood of this being a rare blockbuster with an original concept. True enough, it&apos;s not based on a comic book, though &quot;original&quot; is a stretch when the premise boils down to three words: Monsters! Robots! Fight! Super-sized sea creatures called Kaijus are rising from the ocean to put humanity in its place; the military&apos;s only combat option are equally colossal humanoid war machines called Jaegers. (Disappointingly, they don&apos;t come dressed in camel-coloured cashmere and sleek tailoring.)      Idris Elba in Pacific Rim: 'state-of-the-art trash'.    A stiff Idris Elba plays our splendidly named commander Stacker Pentecost; the film could use more of this knowingly inflated silliness. Pan&apos;s Labyrinth director del Toro remains an exciting conductor of spectacle, but wit has never been his strong point. This week&apos;s best art-house option is a flawed one. Foxfire (Artificial Eye, 15) is Frenchman Laurent Cantet&apos;s first English-language effort, and wants for the keen, sociable eye and ear of his masterful The Class. Still, this adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates&apos;s novel about the formation and implosion of a girl gang in 1950s New York is bristly and beautifully realised. There&apos;s less spiky feminism to be found in Kuma (Saffron Hill, 15): a soap-streaked but quietly engrossing study of a Turkish teen duped into a polygamous marriage, it&apos;s also available for streaming in the Guardian screening room. Meanwhile,\u00a0a pair of worthwhile documentaries tackle concerns of creatures great and small: More Than Honey (Eureka, 12A) is an unexpectedly pointed take on the global bee crisis, while Blackfish (Dogwoof, 15) is blatantly but persuasively thriller-ised in its portrayal of killer whales abused in captivity.

This week&apos;s best Netflix addition is Yossi, a wistful, compassionate romantic drama that came and went with little ceremony in cinemas last year. A self-contained sequel to Israeli director Eytan Fox&apos;s Yossi &amp; Jagger, it follows a Tel Aviv doctor (the excellent Ohad Knoller) as he tentatively puts himself back on the market after a shattering loss.

There are, to be sure, a\u00a0few painfully florid patches in this superb autobiography (&quot;Headmaster Mr Coleman rumbles with grumpiness in a rambling stew of hate&quot;), but it would be hard to imagine Ronnie Wood or Eric Clapton portraying the &quot;Duchess of nothing&quot; Sarah Ferguson as &quot;a little bundle of orange crawling out of a frothy dress, the drone of Sloane, blessed with two daughters of Queen Victoria pot-dog pudginess&quot;. Morrissey despises most of the people he meets, often with excellent reason. He is scurrilous, withdrawn and disdainful, an odd mixture of shyness and vitriol. The dreamy, heart-throbbish photo on the cover of the book, the nose rakishly tilted above the\u00a0Cupid&apos;s-bow lips, belies what a mean old bastard he is. He finds an image of himself in (of all people) the minor Georgian poet AE Housman, who preferred art to humanity and whose ascetic, spiritually tortured life seems to echo Morrissey&apos;s own. He admires wayward, bloody-minded types much like himself, and takes a\u00a0sadistic delight in discomforting interviewers. &quot;Why did you mention Battersea in that song?&quot; a journalist asks him. &quot;Because it rhymes with fatty,&quot; he replies. Taken by his father at the age of eight to watch George Best play at Old Trafford, he swoons at the sight of such artistry combined with such rebelliousness. Years later, others will swoon at his own mixing of the two. Some of his bloody-mindedness springs from a damaged childhood. Born into a working-class Irish-Mancunian family, Steven Patrick Morrissey sang his way out of what struck him as a soulless environment, as other working-class Irish Mancunians have written or acted their way out. The vitriol started to flow early: his bleak mausoleum of a Catholic primary school was ruled by Mother Peter, &quot;a\u00a0bearded nun who beat children from\u00a0dawn to dusk&quot;, and by the time he was 17 he was already emotionally exhausted. Manchester, still in its pre-cool days, was a &quot;barbaric place where only savages can survive \u2026 There are no sexual guidelines, and I see myself naked only by appointment.&quot; His eloquent contempt for his fellow citizens is terrifying: &quot;non-human sewer-rats with missing eyes; the loudly insane with indecipherable speech patterns; the mad poor of Manchester&apos;s armpit.&quot; The final indignity is to be turned down for a job\u00a0as a postman at the local sorting office. At the hour of the birth of the Smiths, which gave him the exit from Manchester he craved, he felt himself dying of boredom, loneliness and disgust. &quot;I would talk myself through each day,&quot; he writes, &quot;as one would nurse a dying friend.&quot; Not long afterwards, hordes of young people throughout the world are\u00a0wearing his face on their chests. He returns to the streets where he grew up, now with a police escort, to sing to 17,000 fans from a stage overlooking an odious Inland Revenue office where he once worked. Having failed to find love from one man or woman, he can now find it from thousands. Mick Jagger and Elton John are eager to shake his hand. He enjoys his celebrity, but the sardonic self-irony of the book seeks to\u00a0persuade us otherwise. There is a relish and energy about its prose that undercuts his misanthropy. Its lyrical quality suggests that beneath the hard-bitten scoffer there lurks a romantic softie, while beneath that again lies a hard-bitten scoffer. Implausibly, he claims to be &quot;chilled&quot; by road signs reading &quot;Morrissey Concert, Next Left&quot;. It&apos;s true, however, that having spent years yearning to be seen, he now spends years longing to be invisible. Living in Hollywood is hardly the best place for that. He deals with his own egocentricity by being wryly amusing about it: his birth almost killed his mother, he comments, because even then his head was too\u00a0big. Even so, he remains for the most part icily unillusioned, like a monk passing through a whorehouse. His contempt for the music industry is visceral, and he prefers to spend his time reading Auden and James Baldwin. (Spotting Baldwin in a Barcelona hotel, he decides not to approach him, since even the mildest rejection would apparently mean he would have to go and hang himself.) The solution to all problems, he tells us, &quot;is the goodness of privacy in a warm room with books&quot;. David Bowie tells him that he&apos;s had so much sex and drugs that he&apos;s surprised he is still alive, to which Morrissey replies that he&apos;s had so little of both that he feels much the same. Tom Hanks comes backstage to say hello, but Morrissey doesn&apos;t know who he is. The press lie that he is a racist, that he opened the door to a journalist wearing a tutu, that he hung around public toilets as a youth and that he would welcome the assassination of Margaret Thatcher. The Guardian runs a disapproving piece on him adorned with a photo of somebody else. When he discovers that a Smiths record released in Japan includes a track by Sandie Shaw, he begs the people around him to kill him. &quot;Many rush forward,&quot; he adds. &quot;Although a passable human creature on the outside,&quot; he comments of himself, &quot;the swirling\u00a0soul within seemed to speak up for the most awkward people on the planet&quot;, of whom he himself ranks among the most adept. He is one of the great curmudgeons and contrarians of our time. He\u00a0even puts in a\u00a0good word for the Kray brothers. Surprisingly, he goes easy on his passion for animal rights, but observes no such restraint when it comes to George Bush (&quot;the world&apos;s most famous active terrorist&quot;) and Tony Blair, at whose feet he lays the London deaths of 2005. At least the vindictive music industry has taught him how to\u00a0hate, though one suspects he didn&apos;t\u00a0need much tutoring. The music impresario Tony Wilson &quot;managed a lengthy and slow decline which some thought was actually an ongoing career&quot;. There is a cameo of Julie Burchill of such sublime savagery that\u00a0one expects the page to ignite. The\u00a0former Smiths who took him to court are subjected to 50 pages of devastatingly articulate venom. Though he is careful to inform us that he drives a sky-blue Jag, fame hasn&apos;t changed him much. He is still the same miserable old Mozzer he always was. The death of friends leads him to wonder movingly whether life isn&apos;t &quot;all too burdensome, with so much loss taking its root in the heart, as the body goes spinning on towards a\u00a0dreadful cessation&quot;. It isn&apos;t the kind of sentence Robbie Williams would come up with. His interest in the dead, his father warns him, outstrips his affection for the living. He sees a ghost on Saddleworth Moor, burial ground of\u00a0the Moors murders, and narrowly avoids being kidnapped in Mexico. Everywhere he looks he sees violence: &quot;military science whaling, nuclear weapons, armed combat, the abattoir, holy war \u2026 riot police assaulting innocent civilians.&quot; When a small, flightless bird comes to live in his back garden, he fences it in with boxes to ward off predators. He has quite a few such boxes of his own. Perhaps the time has come for a new\u00a0career. If he could get treatment for his addiction to alliteration and stop using phrases like &quot;for you and I&quot;, this prodigiously talented &quot;small boy of 52&quot;, as he described himself two years ago, could walk away with the Booker prize.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-13T12:00:00Z", "title": "Autobiography by Morrissey \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Not content with being voted the greatest northern male ever, the second greatest living British icon (he lost out to David Attenborough) and granted the freedom of the city of Tel Aviv, Morrissey is now out to demonstrate that he can write the kind of burnished prose no other singer on the planet could aspire to."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/13/autobiography-by-morrissey-review"}, {"tags": ["World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Sepp Blatter", "Fifa", "World Cup", "Sport", "Football"], "article": "Sepp Blatter sat back, a look of part-amusement, part-disbelief adorning his face, and emitted a hearty chuckle right from the bottom of his gut. &quot;They have asked, &apos;Can we be the 33rd team?&apos; They have asked for that, really.&quot; Everyone else laughed along and the Republic of Ireland were the butt of world football&apos;s jokes. The essence of sport is for there to be winners and losers. It is cruel and, although Blatter&apos;s laughter might have been deemed slightly unprofessional, it was hard not to join in as he revealed the Football Association of Ireland&apos;s plea for inclusion in the 2010 World Cup after Thierry Henry&apos;s handball led to France&apos;s winning goal in their play-off meeting. Blatter&apos;s attitude towards the play-offs has changed since, however. &quot;They are unfair,&quot; he said last week. And the only positive that can be taken is that they make for good TV. That statement could be construed as a lot of hot air from the Fifa president and his admittance that he would need to find a solution indicates that an actual decision to cease with the play-offs is not quite imminent. Yet one of international football&apos;s most thrilling dates on the calendar, mixed between countless humdrum friendlies, is being threatened. After all, is unfairness not part of the game&apos;s attraction? The excitement of a two-legged straightforward knockout game remains one of the great tension-ridden spectacles in football. Taking away play-offs would also prolong the gap of competitive international football even further: between early October and the following June there would not be a meaningful international game played in Europe. Meanwhile the amount of sleep-inducing friendlies where players are more concerned about avoiding injury, international managers worry about the fury of clubs and the football is, generally, sub-standard, continues to take up more and more of the calendar. There has always been a certain beauty about these games since the inception of a separate Uefa stream in 1998 \u2013 a purity not only in terms of format but the approach of teams. There can be one-sided matches, as both of Tuesday&apos;s intercontinental ties showed but every four years there has been at least one long-enduring memory from the Uefa ties. Defensive shackles are often thrown off, teams are gung-ho and it results in plenty of excitement. Why take that away? Initially the play-off was stumbled on almost by accident when Sudan refused to play Israel in the final round of CAF (Africa)/AFC (Asia) qualifying for 1958 on political grounds and Wales were put forward as the best runner-up from Uefa to face Israel over two legs. Wales qualified with ease, winning 2-0 in both Tel Aviv and Ninian Park, although progression was determined by two points for a win rather than aggregate. Four years later there were three play-off games \u2013 with Spain, Mexico and Yugoslavia thankful for their introduction \u2013 but none was required for 1966 and 1970 while the Soviet Union were expelled between legs against Chile for 1974 having refused to play in Santiago on political grounds. Hungary hammered Bolivia 9-2 on aggregate to make it to Argentina in 1978 and eight years later Scotland edged Australia to secure a place in Mexico, with Colombia triumphing over Israel to qualify for Italy in 1990. Australia had a mammoth task to qualify in 1994, overcoming New Zealand in an Oceanic play-off before then defeating Canada to set up a final round against Argentina only to miss out because of an own-goal by their centre-half Alex Tobin. Then, for France 1998, a separate round of Uefa play-offs was introduced, giving a whole new lease of life to the qualification process. Since then each set has thrown up a fascinating story line. There was Yugoslavia&apos;s remarkable destruction of Hungary, winning 12-1 on aggregate with Predrag Mijatovic scoring hat-tricks in both legs. Turkey qualified for 2002 through the play-offs and ended up finishing third in Japan and South Korea. They were then defeated on away goals next time by Switzerland after it finished 4-4 on aggregate through a dramatic Tuncay hat-trick in the second leg in Istanbul. And although the Republic of Ireland, full of hard work and endeavour at the Stade de France, were hard done by on the road to South Africa, the achievement of Slovenia four years ago was given short shrift. Two goals down in the first leg in Russia, Nejc Pecnik&apos;s 88th-minute strike gave them hope before they renewed acquaintances and won 1-0 in Maribor to go through on away goals. That a team can perform admirably in a lengthy campaign to reach the play-offs but then, gut-wrenchingly, have their dreams taken, or in the case of Ireland, palmed away, is what makes the play-offs so enthralling. For the four victorious Uefa nations next Tuesday, qualifying for Brazil will taste so much sweeter than a procession through the group stages. Yet most importantly these are fixtures that are loved by supporters, as referred to by Blatter last week. There is, inevitably considering the addition of new Fifa members, constant tinkering with the qualification process but putting a halt to play-offs entirely would only dilute the international game when it needs strengthening. The World Cup might still be the game&apos;s greatest stage but international breaks during club seasons are viewed as a nuisance. Taking away the play-offs would only serve as another nail in the international game&apos;s coffin.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-15T09:01:02Z", "title": "World Cup play-offs are not fair but abolishing them would be worse | Alan Smith", "sentences": ["Wales qualified with ease, winning 2-0 in both Tel Aviv and Ninian Park, although progression was determined by two points for a win rather than aggregate."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/15/world-cup-playoffs-fair-abolish-harm-game"}, {"tags": ["Manchester United", "Cameroon", "Partizan Belgrade", "Aston Villa", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Two players made their Premier League debuts for Manchester United against Bolton Wanderers at Old Trafford on 10 August 2003, just over a decade ago. One was a precocious Portuguese winger who went on to win three league titles, one FA Cup, two League Cups and the Champions League during six glittering seasons at the club. The other was ... Eric Djemba-Djemba. It is perhaps fair to say that the two players&apos; paths went separate ways from there, but looking at Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 often playing with a pained expression and saying he was sad at Real Madrid last season \u2013 and speaking to Djemba-Djemba, it is not immediately obvious who is the happier. Djemba-Djemba was bought as a promising 22-year-old from Nantes for \u00a33.5m by Sir Alex Ferguson that summer and still remembers his debut as if it were yesterday. &quot;It was fantastic. It was with Cristiano Ronaldo and it was our first game in the league,&quot; he says of replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on 67 minutes. &quot;We came on together against Bolton and it was fantastic because we won that game 4-0 and I was very happy in the dressing room afterwards.&quot; While Ronaldo remained on the bench for United&apos;s next game, at Newcastle United, Djemba-Djemba made his first start in an XI that featured Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane and Solskjaer. United won 2-1. Djemba-Djemba became a fixture in Ferguson&apos;s lineup during those early days, playing in 13 games before going off to the Africa Cup of Nations in January. Indeed, there were goals as well, one against Panathinaikos in the Champions League and another against Leeds United in the League Cup. The 32-year-old, now playing for Partizan Belgrade, remembers the last one vividly. &quot;Oh my God, you remember that time! It was so nice. In my house I have a picture from when I scored against Leeds in the Carling Cup. It was in extra time and I scored from a corner. And I still have a picture in my head from when I go into the dressing room after the game. There was Alex Ferguson. He was smiling. A big smile, with his glasses on. He was so happy.&quot; Ferguson may have been happy on that day but in his recent autobiography he admitted that several of his signings during that era did not work out. Ferguson wrote: &quot;Kl\u00e9berson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and David Bellion were among the new faces \u2026 You can&apos;t dodge the truth about those years. We rushed down the path of buying in proven players \u2013 who we thought would match our standards right away \u2026 Djemba-Djemba had been playing at a decent level in France. They were easy or obvious signings. I like having to fight for a player on the grounds that a battle to extricate him means you&apos;re acquiring something valuable.&quot; But Ferguson could not deny that Djemba-Djemba was a wonderful character, even if things did not work out for him on the pitch. &quot;Djemba-Djemba, another smashing lad, was hammered by the press for not being a signature signing. They always liked the marquee names and took a much dimmer view of players with a lower recognition rating. Eric struck us as potentially another top central midfielder. I went to see him playing in France and he did really well. He understood the game, nipped attacks in the bud very well and was available for \u20ac4m.&quot; Djemba-Djemba, though, became synonymous with the only serious wobble of Ferguson&apos;s success-soaked years at Old Trafford. He was the Keane replacement signed on a five-year contract who would depart United before the Irishman, sold to Aston Villa in January 2005 for \u00a31.35m, two years into a three-season barren spell for the club without a league title, the longest of Ferguson&apos;s reign after he secured a first championship. The Cameroonian&apos;s CV shows only 13 league starts, in 35 United appearances. A nomadic eight years followed, with stops after Villa including Burnley (on loan), Qatar Sports Club, Denmark&apos;s Odense, and Hapoel Tel Aviv of Israel, before he arrived at Partizan this summer. So what happened at United? &quot;I was not being [selected] in many games and it was difficult,&quot; Djemba-Djemba says. &quot;Roy Keane came back from injury, I wanted to play games and I had a talk with the gaffer. He said: &apos;No problem. If you have [another] team and you want to continue to play, that&apos;s not a problem.&apos;&quot; As Djemba-Djemba says going from Douala, where the Cameroonian grew up, to the Theatre of Dreams can only be viewed as a success story. &quot;It was a big achievement. Even if you are from an OK family in Africa, life can sometimes be difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;I have 10 brothers and sisters, I was the No9 [and] we had a house with four bedrooms. My first training at Carrington, though \u2026 I had to pinch myself. I was training with Van Nistelrooy, Giggs \u2013 Ryan Giggs is an unbelievable player, fantastic \u2013 Keane, Paul Scholes. It was: Wow!&quot; he says. The first day of training at Carrington enthralled. Of his fellow debutant, Djemba-Djemba says there was clear signs of the path Ronaldo would take: &quot;In training, with his pace at 17, he was like a car. He was so fast. I need to kick him to take the ball. He was running like he had stolen something, like a thief.&quot; That first season ended with United winning the FA Cup, the last time they claimed the trophy. Djemba-Djemba featured once, as a substitute in the 2-1 quarter-final win over Fulham at Old Trafford. As an unused reserve for the 3-0 victory over Millwall in the final he received a medal, to go with his 2002 Africa Cup of Nations winners&apos; gong. There is gratitude that Ferguson named him on the bench. &quot;Oh not disappointed because I have the title. For me it is [about] a group,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&apos;t come on but I played before so was happy.&quot; The move to Villa in January 2005, signed by David O&apos;Leary, was less enjoyable. &quot;If you go from Manchester United to Aston Villa you go to play many games,&quot; he says. &quot;After four games I got a hamstring injury [in a 3-1 defeat to Everton on 26 February 2005] and after that, it was difficult for him and me to understand each other. We didn&apos;t agree. I didn&apos;t have a good experience with David O&apos;Leary \u2013 he didn&apos;t give me a chance again,&quot; he says. Djemba-Djemba made only four league starts in 18 months, with his final appearance as a substitute against Arsenal on the opening day of the 2006-07 season in the first game at the new Emirates Stadium. While this was under Martin O&apos;Neill, who had replaced O&apos;Leary, what ultimately burned bridges with the latter were comments made during the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. &quot;I say in an interview that I didn&apos;t understand David O&apos;Leary, why I don&apos;t play. When I came back he didn&apos;t like it. He say to me he didn&apos;t like it, I say to him this is what I think, so I didn&apos;t play again.&quot; There was a more enjoyable time on loan at Burnley, from January 2007 until the end of that season. &quot;Steve Cotterill was manager, I was so happy to work with him because he was a great man. He say to me: &apos;If you work you will play.&apos;&quot; This was only two years after leaving United. Yet Djemba-Djemba says there was no difficulty in motivating himself for a lower league. &quot;Life is not complicated. Manchester is a great team and everyone wants to play for Manchester. But if they don&apos;t give you the chance and you have the opportunity to play for teams that want you, you should go and enjoy. It&apos;s football.&quot; The philosophy took Djemba-Djemba to Qatar SC for the 2007-08 season, Odense. &quot;I stayed four years and played more than 100 games. Oh my God, I enjoy,&quot; he says. &quot;I enjoy playing every year the Europa League and three years in a row [though] we didn&apos;t take the championship, we were second.&quot; In his opening campaign, many in Danish football believed him to be the player of the year, and though he finished second in the official vote, there was a special reunion at the awards ceremony. &quot;Ferguson came to give the trophy, he was invited by [Peter] Schmeichel, who was working for Danish TV. I saw him, I was happy, and we took a picture together. He was so happy and we laugh \u2013 he is a funny grandad, you know. &quot; After last term&apos;s stint at Hapoel, &quot;I enjoyed,&quot; came the move to the Serbian capital. &quot;Partizan is a very good level, you are playing normally Champions League and Europa League every year,&quot; he says of the Super Liga leaders. Now the Cameroonian, who is divorced and has four children, hopes to play until he is 36. &quot;After I will see if I have the power to continue,&quot; the midfielder says. &quot;I have no regrets about anything in my career. You realise it is football and God decides everything. I was happy to be playing for Manchester, happy to be winning titles, happy the way they treat me. And I have no regrets about going to Aston Villa, it was the choice of God, that&apos;s it. When you are young you can do some mistakes: for me, I never regret my mistakes. I could have stayed longer if I wanted to. But it&apos;s not well to stay and to play one or two games in five years.&quot; Joining had been the fantasy transfer for a boyhood United fanatic nicknamed Cantona who followed the club from his hometown, Doula. &quot;It was my dream come true \u2013 Manchester United,&quot; he says. &quot;My hero was Eric Cantona.

The dramatic development in a long-running case instigated by the state of Israel came late on Friday when the Israeli government filed a legal motion to prevent its former agent being subpoenaed as a star witness, citing security concerns. The US judge hearing the case had previously said the agent&apos;s testimony was crucial. The plaintiffs and their lawyers claim the move is to protect economic ties with Beijing. Instead of championing justice for the victims of suicide bombings and attacks, Israel has caved in to Chinese demands, critics say. Two related cases are being brought by US citizens against the state-owned Bank of China for allegedly allowing the transfer of funds to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Palestinian militant organisations responsible for suicide bombings that have killed hundreds of people. One is a group action on behalf of 22 relatives of victims; the other was brought by the father of Daniel Wultz, a 16-year-old boy killed in a bombing in Tel Aviv in 2006. The families are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The origins of the case lie in Israel&apos;s discovery eight years ago that funds were being channelled to Hamas and Islamic Jihad via accounts held with the Bank of China. Israeli security officials were dispatched to Beijing to alert the Chinese authorities to the transfer of funds and to request its cessation. After the Chinese authorities failed to act, Israel sought and found US citizens prepared to sue the Bank of China, which has branches in America, under US anti-terrorism laws. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are proscribed by the US as terrorist organisations. The former Israeli agent Uzi Shaya, who was part of the 2005 delegation to Beijing, was due to appear for questioning in New York on 25 November. At an earlier hearing, the judge, Shira Scheindlin, said Shaya &quot;may be the only person who really has the knowledge as to what transpired at the [2005] meeting&quot;. Shaya had previously indicated his willingness to testify, but said he needed authorisation from his government. Now Israel has moved to bar the agent from giving evidence on the grounds that it could endanger national security. In a statement released on Saturday, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s office said: &quot;After conducting a comprehensive review of the matter, the state of Israel concluded that it cannot allow the former official to be forced to disclose in foreign legal proceedings any information that came to his knowledge in the course of his official duties. &quot;The disclosure of such information would harm Israel&apos;s national security, compromise Israel&apos;s ability to protect within its border, and interfere with international co-operative efforts to prevent terrorism.&quot; It added that Israel &quot;stands with victims of terror and their families and sympathises with their profound agony and pain&quot;. Israel has become alarmed about the impact of the case on diplomatic and trade relations with China. In the runup to a visit by Netanyahu to Beijing in May, the prime minister reportedly gave assurances under Chinese pressure that Israeli officials would not testify in the case. The two nations have since discussed a bilateral free-trade agreement. The finance minister, Naftali Bennett, said on a visit to China in July that &quot;such an agreement would considerably increase the amount&quot; of trade, currently worth at least $8bn annually. An article by a trio of prominent columnists in Yedioth Ahronoth described the move as &quot;one of the gloomiest days in the annals of Israel&apos;s lengthy war on terrorism&quot;. It said a high-ranking delegation from China had visited Israel to meet Netanyahu two weeks ago. &quot;In the course of the visit, a deal was reached: Israel will refrain from aiding the bereaved families in their suit, and China will not realise its threat to close its doors to the Israeli economy,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Israel bowed to the dictates of the Chinese government.&quot; An Israeli lawyer representing the 22 families in the group action said she was &quot;deeply concerned and disappointed&quot; by the Israeli government&apos;s move. &quot;Financial engagement&quot; with China should not be &quot;at the cost of abandoning those families who have had loved ones murdered by the Palestinian terror groups who we allege moved funds through the Bank of China,&quot; said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner. Yekutiel Wultz, the father of the teenage boy killed in Tel Aviv, said he had been asked by the Israeli government to bring the case.

Netanyahu said the deal would leave Iran with 18,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium. &quot;They are not giving up one centrifuge, not one,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve been around for about 4,000 years, the Jewish people, and we are not about to let ayatollahs armed with nuclear weapons threaten that,&quot; he said. He said it was &quot;no secret&quot; that many Arab leaders held the same opinion. Netanyahu called for an increase in sanctions, a move which would have the support of many Republicans in Congress. &quot;I think you should increase that pressure because it&apos;s finally working,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you give it up now when you have that pressure and Iran doesn&apos;t take apart one centrifuge when you have that pressure, what leverage will you have if you ease the pressure? It just doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; Talks in Geneva between Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States \u2013 are set to resume this week. On Saturday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, talked up the chances of a deal being reached. &quot;Our common impression is that there is a very good chance that must not be passed up,&quot; he said.  On Sunday, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in Israel to meet Netanyahu, offered reassurance about France&apos;s tough stance on the Geneva talks. &quot;France will not give way on nuclear proliferation,&quot; Hollande said, at a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport. &quot;So long as we are not certain that Iran has renounced nuclear arms, we will keep in place all our demands and sanctions.&quot;  Western diplomats have said one of the sticking points to ending 10 years of sanctions is Iran&apos;s argument that its right to enrich uranium should be recognised. The US argues that Iran does not have that right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  On Sunday, in an interview with the ISNA news agency, Iran&apos;s chief negotiator and foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, suggested that recognition of that right need not be included in any deal. &quot;Not only do we consider that Iran&apos;s right to enrich is unnegotiable, but we see no need for that to be recognised as &apos;a right&apos;, because this right is inalienable and all countries must respect that,&quot; he said.  After his meeting with President Hollande, Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to Moscow to see the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, this week and then return to Israel to meet the US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Friday. Speaking on CNN, Netanyahu said it was clear that sanctions were working and Iran&apos;s economy was &quot;on the ropes&quot;.  &quot;The options aren&apos;t really a bad deal \u2013 and this is a bad deal \u2013 or war, there&apos;s a third option: sanctions. Increase the sanctions,&quot; he said. Senators including John McCain have been calling for increased sanctions on Iran. This week McCain called Kerry a &quot;human wrecking ball&quot; over Iran. &quot;I have never been more worried about the parameters of this deal,&quot; he said. Netanyahu said he would prefer a diplomatic solution. &quot;We need a good solution and that&apos;s the main point. The problem with a partial deal is you reduce the sanctions and in this case Iran is practically giving away nothing.

The chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the decision to introduce allocated seating on its flights had drawn in older passengers and business travellers who once shunned the budget airline. &quot;I think no question there has been an increase in people who refused to even contemplate flying easyJet.&quot; The average age of an easyJet passenger is now 42, compared with 38 or 39 a few years ago - &quot;a small but \u2026 significant change&quot; that reflects changing perceptions of easyJet, McCall said. Many older passengers, especially, &quot;our parents&apos; generation&quot;, do not want to be in the scrum for boarding, she said. EasyJet&apos;s rising fortunes help explain why struggling rival Ryanair has launched a charm offensive to win back customers put off by its reputation for penny-pinching and aggressive customer service. Ryanair, still Europe&apos;s largest no-frills carrier, recently announced it was introducing allocated seating, after issuing two profits warnings in two months. But McCall contended that easyJet&apos;s main rivals were legacy carriers, where there is more direct competition in the same airports. &quot;It is about competing with Alitalia, Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa and those are our key markets.&quot; EasyJet has boomed as a host of regional airlines and legacy national carriers have run into trouble in recent years, reducing the number of players in the market. Small carriers have closed, while British Airways owner International Airlines Group has cut routes, allowing rivals to fill the gaps. EasyJet&apos;s offer of allocated seating, as well as declining competition in the European aviation market, helped it to a 51% growth in pre-tax profits. In a set of results that sent its share price up by more than 6% to \u00a313.54, easyJet reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3478m for the year to the end of September, up from \u00a3317m the previous year. Almost 61 million passengers flew with easyJet during the year, including 11 million business customers, a more lucrative group because they book later and are prepared to pay for more leg-room. This helped lift the average profit per seat to \u00a37.03, up from \u00a34.81 in 2012. The strong results put easyJet shareholders \u2013 including controversial company founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou \u2013 in line for a \u00a3308m windfall. The budget airline has promised shareholders a special dividend of \u00a3175m, on top of the ordinary dividend of \u00a3133m, which is paid in line with the company&apos;s policy of doling out one third of annual profits to investors. Haji-Ioannou, who holds 36.5% of shares and has repeatedly clashed with easyJet&apos;s board this year over plans to buy 135 Airbus jets, can be expected to gain more than \u00a3100m. He described the payout as a victory for shareholders: &quot;The directors have now accepted that more money has to be returned to the shareholders \u2013 if only they would accept that less cash should go to Airbus for more planes.&quot; McCall, a former boss of the Guardian Media Group, will also reap rewards: she could take home \u00a33.37m in pay, bonuses and share options in 2013, compared with \u00a33.1m last year. She is credited with improving customer service and cutting costs since she joined the budget airline in 2010. As well as allocated seating and the introduction of speedy boarding, easyJet has overhauled its in-flight menus, offering porridge and fruit salad, as well as the usual coffee and sandwiches. The airline has dropped unprofitable routes, while introducing flights to Moscow and Luxembourg from the UK, and opening a base in Naples. EasyJet plans to launch flights to Strasbourg and Tel Aviv, targeting business and leisure customers. The airline has said it expects capacity to grow by 5% next year, but warned that its next set of quarterly numbers may look subdued against last year, when interest in visiting the UK surged after the Olympics. City analysts cheered the results, which come after easyJet arrived in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies in March. Over the past year easyJet has seen its share price rise 96%, compared with a 20% average rise for the FTSE 100, according to Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. &quot;EasyJet is maintaining cruising altitude with another set of fine numbers,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-19T14:40:00Z", "title": "EasyJet: allocated seating attracts older passengers and boosts profits", "sentences": ["EasyJet plans to launch flights to Strasbourg and Tel Aviv, targeting business and leisure customers."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/19/easyjey-shareholders-windfall-profits-up-50-percent"}, {"tags": ["Cycling", "Road safety", "Fitness", "Life and style", "London", "UK news", "Sweden", "India", "Germany", "China", "Netherlands", "Paris", "Los Angeles"], "article": "Malm\u00f6 When I arrived in Malm\u00f6 two years ago, it was the free bicycle pumps, installed in convenient places on cycle paths, which showed me that, when it\u00a0comes to cycling in Sweden, Malm\u00f6 leads the way. Sweden&apos;s third-largest city is laced with 500km (310 miles) of cycle lanes, more even than in Copenhagen, a short hop across the \u00d6resunds Bridge. About a quarter of all journeys in the city are already made by bike. That is an estimated 100,000 trips a day for the its 307,000 inhabitants. Stockholmers, by contrast, use bikes for fewer than 10% of trips. When I take my daughter to day care in the morning on the back of my bike, the cycle lanes are packed with parents and commuters. Almost all my friends own cargo bikes, which they use to ferry their young families to day care, or to do the weekly shop. Remarkably, in the 10 years from 2003 to 2012, the city has seen only 16 cyclists killed in an accident involving a car. Olle Even\u00e4s, a traffic planner for Malm\u00f6, puts this down to the way the city has built its cycle lanes. &quot;In Malm\u00f6 we have two-way cycle lanes, every single track, which isn&apos;t the case in Copenhagen. We never have painted lanes as cycle tracks; we always have a dedicated surface which is separated from the car traffic by a divider and up a level from car traffic.&quot; The law-abiding nature of the people also helps cut down on fatalities. For Swedes, cycling in the wrong direction on a cycle path or, worse still, on a pavement intended for pedestrians, elicits the sort of outrage people in the UK reserve for those dumping their rubbish on the pavement. The city continues to try to cut car use, aiming to increase cycling&apos;s share of journeys to 30% by 2018. To do this it has earmarked at least 400m kroner (\u00a337m) to be spent on various cycling programmes in the years 2012-19. &quot;This is the money we know we have for sure, but we are going to be spending even more than that,&quot; says Even\u00e4s.Richard Orange     Cyclists in Delhi must compete with rickshaws and the city's seven million cars. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images    Delhi Size is power on India&apos;s roads and in the\u00a0caste system of transport, cyclists rank just a notch above pedestrians and stray animals. Buses and SUVs rarely, if ever, give way to lesser mortals. Indeed, pedestrians attempting to cross a road here, even with children in tow, are invariably honked\u00a0at while drivers speed towards\u00a0them. By and large, cycling is not a lifestyle choice for the middle classes. Rather, it\u00a0is the default mode of transport for those who cannot afford anything else.\u00a0Labourers, deliverymen and semi-skilled workers such as plumbers and carpenters use bicycles. They are India&apos;s struggling masses, not its moneyed elite. In 2012, according to India&apos;s National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 168,301 people died on its roads. In New Delhi, that includes 78 cyclists and 501 pedestrians. There are nominal cycle lanes on some of the capital&apos;s main thoroughfares, but with seven million cars jostling for space, those lanes are often cannibalised by motorised rickshaws and scooters, leaving no safe space for bicyclists. Cyclists rarely wear helmets and there are no viable emergency services to ferry accident victims to\u00a0hospitals. In recent years, some intrepid middle-class Indian and foreign expatriate cyclists have begun to brave Delhi&apos;s roads. Recognisable by their expensive bicycles, helmets and high-visibility vests, they can sometimes be spotted along the quieter avenues of colonial New Delhi. One company, Delhi by Cycle, has even set up two-wheeled tours through the narrow, twisting lanes of the old city. But they start before dawn, before cars, motorbikes, cycle rickshaws, pushcarts, cows\u00a0and the ever-present crush of pedestrians appear. If cycling in London is dangerous, Delhi is like having a near-death experience every single time. Anu Anand     Cyclists are well-catered for in Berlin, but it still saw 15 cyclist deaths in 2012. Photograph: Adam Berry/Getty Images    Berlin In many ways, Berlin is a cyclists&apos; paradise. Most major roads have clearly marked cycling lanes, either on the pavement or on the road itself. The age\u00a0range of cyclists is broader than in London: with old ladies and kids sharing lanes with bike couriers in Lycra, road behaviour tends to be less aggressive. Some major junctions even have a special set of traffic lights for cyclists, allowing them a head start ahead of\u00a0motorists. That doesn&apos;t mean there are no problems. Fifteen cyclists died in 2012, seven of them through collisions with lorries; 4,533 more were injured over the same period. According to the German Cycling Club (ADFC), one of the most common causes of accidents are cars turning into side streets at high speed and cutting off cyclists in the lanes to\u00a0their right. Berlin&apos;s many tram lines can also be a hazard: the track grooves are perfect for trapping the wheel of your average city bike. In spite of being notoriously cash-strapped, Berlin has taken steps to make cycling safer. This month, the city authorities launched an online survey in order to\u00a0help identify trouble spots. On radsicherheit.berlin.de, users can mark\u00a0dangerous junctions, blocked paths and road potholes, as well as recording &quot;near-misses&quot; that they didn&apos;t log with the police at the time. But Berlin also expects its cyclists to\u00a0stick to the rules more than London does. One reason for this is self-policing: try going down a cycling path on the wrong side of the road, even in an alternative district such as Kreuzberg, and you will soon be bellowed at by other cyclists or by pedestrians. Cycling offences are not just punished with on-the-spot fines: any fine over \u20ac45 (\u00a337.50) also comes with points that show up on your driving licence (which means that, in theory, you can end up with points on your licence before you have even passed your driving test). And, unlike Britain, Germany has a drink-drive limit for cyclists: a blood alcohol content of 0.16%, though some regions have recently tried to lower the limit to the same as that for cars (0.05%). This also explains the German word for a shandy: Radler or &quot;cyclist&quot;, because it\u00a0just about keeps you sober enough to\u00a0stay on your bike.Philip Oltermann     Beijing hopes to have a quarter of its residents cycling by 2015. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images    Beijing Beijing was once a city of bikes. Now it&apos;s a city of traffic. There are more than 5m cars in Beijing, and they have transformed its once-generous thoroughfares into a noxious, honking mass. Cycling helps me rise above the noise. I bike 5km (3 miles) to work every day, weaving through Ming dynasty-era alleyways, gliding past shadowy government offices, darting among flatbed tricycles hauling mysterious metal tanks. The Chinese capital is notorious for its air pollution, and my commute isn&apos;t always pleasant. But when the smog lifts and the city snaps into focus, it&apos;s the highlight of my day. Along with the freedom comes a fair amount of risk. According to official statistics, cyclists were involved in more than 10,000 of China&apos;s 67,759 traffic accident-related deaths in 2009. Scooters blast through red lights; cars park on the pavements. Nobody wears a helmet. Last winter, I was riding to work when I collided with an auto-rickshaw. They are the sharks of the city&apos;s bike lanes \u2013 vault-sized motorised boxes that are almost as powerful as small cars, but are not required to play by the same rules. It was on the wrong side of the road. I veered left; the driver veered right; I hit the side of the carriage and fell over. The driver, a middle-aged man with oily hair, decided to play the defensive \u2013 he was clearly from the countryside, and if the accident was serious, my medical bills could have wiped out his savings. He pointed his finger at me, yelling. A crowd began to gather. I shot him a middle finger and pedaled away, my right knee bleeding, my handlebars askew. In 2010, the Beijing government announced hopes that by 2015, nearly a\u00a0fourth of the city&apos;s residents would use cycling as their primary mode of transportation. It doesn&apos;t seem likely. The city is too much of a sprawl, its traffic too unruly. There are other reasons, too. On Monday night, I returned to a restaurant where I had parked my one-speed Giant overnight, only to find it missing. A passerby saw me looking, and asked how long I&apos;d left it outside. &quot;Too long, I\u00a0guess,&quot; I said. &quot;You should\u00a0know better,&quot; she replied. &quot;This\u00a0is China.&quot;Jonathan Kaiman     Amsterdam has long had a reputation for 'traffic anarchy', but if it's chaos, it works extremely well. Photograph: David R. Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy    Amsterdam Over the course of my 11 years of daily biking in Amsterdam, I have never worn the helmet I brought with me from the US. No one needs a helmet here. Instead of putting the onus on the cyclists to protect themselves, in Amsterdam the onus is on society to provide a safe environment to ride in. Here, everyone bikes: the young, the old, the tourists. It usually takes me less than an hour to spot three pregnant cyclists. I had never realised how stressed I\u00a0was while biking in America until I biked with relative ease in Amsterdam. Despite the decades-old reputation of Amsterdam&apos;s cyclists for being &quot;traffic anarchists&quot; \u2013 riding through red lights, biking without lights at night, and so on \u2013 it is a chaos that works incredibly well. Most motorists here are also cyclists, which enables them to better anticipate the behaviour of cyclists in traffic. Driving instructors teach new motorists to use their right hand to open their door, which forces the driver to turn, putting them in a better position to see if a cyclist is approaching from behind. Amsterdam is by no means perfect. Cycling fatalities do occur \u2013 estimates say about six a year - but on nothing like the scale that they do in the British capital. And the Dutch do not rest on their laurels with the infrastructure they have created over the past 30 years. I\u00a0am always pleasantly amazed by how the city continues to be improved.Pete Jordan     Paris has taken its V\u00e9lib' scheme of hire bikes to its heart. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Paris  Paris is extremely proud of the fact it was the first capital to introduce a city-wide free bicycle scheme. Known as V\u00e9lib&apos;, a combination of the words v\u00e9lo (bike) and libert\u00e9 (freedom), it was introduced in 2007 by Socialist mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb. Now approaching retirement, Delano\u00eb considers it one of the great triumphs of his term in office. By 2012, when V\u00e9lib&apos; was celebrating its fifth birthday, there were around 23,000 of the heavy grey bicycles in circulation, more than double the number when it was launched. There are now 1,700 bicycle &quot;stations&quot; \u2013 1,400\u00a0of them in Paris itself and 300 in\u00a0surrounding towns. In 2007, there were just 750. Under the Socialists, the French capital has installed 652km (405 miles) of dedicated cycle routes for the 224,000 Parisians who have signed up to V\u00e9lib&apos;, a figure that will rise to 700km by the end of 2014. Launching several thousand bicycles onto the city&apos;s roads in 2007 caused widespread safety concerns, but they have proven largely unfounded. While cycling around the Arc de Triomphe can be a perilous exercise, with cars coming from all directions following the now largely outdated &quot;priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 droite&quot; rule, the number of accidents involving cyclists between 2007 and 2012 was relatively low: 12 have died, eight of them while using a V\u00e9lib&apos;. More than 660 have been injured, according to police, though most of the injuries were reported as &quot;not serious&quot;. In 2010, 43 people died in accidents on Paris&apos;s streets and boulevards: two cyclists, 18 pedestrians, 17 motorcyclists and scooter riders and six vehicle drivers or passengers, according to the Paris Pr\u00e9fecture de Police. In 2011, not a single cyclist died. Accident investigators say because there are more cyclists around, other road users have become more used to them and are giving them &quot;greater respect&quot;. The rules of the road \u2013 &quot;I don&apos;t ride on the pavement, I respect traffic lights and stop signs, I don&apos;t carry passengers and I don&apos;t ignore no entry signs&quot; \u2013 are posted on each V\u00e9lib&apos; bike.Kim Willsher     Moscow's bike-hire scheme works well in summer \u2013 but is mothballed for the harsh winter months. Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty Images    Moscow With 10-lane highways cutting through its centre, roads covered in snow and ice for much of the year, and drivers who \u2013 to put it charitably \u2013 do not always obey the letter of the law, Moscow has never been much of a city for cyclists. Those who can afford a car brave the legendary traffic jams, while those that cannot use the ruthlessly efficient metro system. In recent years, however, as the chaos\u00a0of post-communist wild capitalism has subsided and thoughts have turned in some quarters to issues such\u00a0as quality of life and urban planning, bicycles have become a more visible part of Moscow&apos;s fabric. This year, a local equivalent of Boris bikes was even introduced, with the Bank of\u00a0Moscow funding 1,000 bikes and 74\u00a0rental points across the centre of the\u00a0city. It was free to use them for up to half an hour, and just 60p for an hour after that, for those who paid an initial registration fee. The bikes have\u00a0been removed with the onset of winter, but over the summer season nearly 50,000 Muscovites registered for the scheme. Nevertheless, the bikes were still mainly used for cycling along Moscow&apos;s embankments, through its newly renovated parks and along the pedestrianised boulevard ring that runs through the centre. Actually using a bike as a means of getting from A to B along normal roads is still a matter for the brave and the foolhardy, and cyclists on the roads are a rare sight indeed.Shaun Walker     Rome's cyclists hope that their bike-friendly mayor can deliver. Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images    Rome With its fabled seven hills, cobbled streets and notoriously chaotic traffic, Rome is not an obvious cycling paradise. A bike-sharing scheme launched in 2008 has been an abject failure. And, for what it&apos;s worth, helmets and hi-vis have never been included in any Italian&apos;s definition of bella figura. Despite the risks to both health and\u00a0image, however, many Romans are choosing to brave the roads and get on their bikes. For the first time in decades, more bikes were sold than cars in the recession-hit Italy of 2011, a trend reflected predominantly in the north but also on the traffic-clogged streets of the capital. Many of those who do brave it insist the city&apos;s off-putting image is unfair: it is hard for cars to speed around the narrow, winding streets of the historic centre, they say. Moreover, Roman motorists, whatever their other defects, are used to looking out for people on two-wheels - it&apos;s just that those wheels tend to belong to a Vespa or Piaggio. But tragedies, of course, do happen. Last year, five people died in accidents involving bicycles, according to the city authorities; one person the year before that; three in 2010, and four in 2009. In July, a 60-year-old man called Domenico Calabr\u00f2 was fatally injured in a collision with a car on the city&apos;s south-eastern outskirts. The man who now finds himself at the centre of the city&apos;s cycling future is the mayor, Ignazio Marino, who was elected in June and has repeatedly spoken of the need to make Rome a more bike-friendly capital. He says he is considering various projects in order to boost cycle use, including the creation of parking lots for 10,000 bikes, a new, more successful cycle-sharing scheme, and 20km more cycle paths to add to the patchy existing network. Marino is himself a keen cyclist, often seen whizzing around town, security staff in tow, on a white Lombardo. Even for him, however, it\u00a0hasn&apos;t been straight-forward: in\u00a0July,\u00a0he fell off. Cycling activists are pleased that their new &quot;first citizen&quot; is a bike-lover, but are still waiting to see if he will keep his promises, says Fausto Bonafaccia, president of the BiciRoma association. &quot;The cycle path situation is improper for a city like Rome, the capital of Italy, where vegetation, disjointedness and potholes represent daily obstacles for those who want to travel by bike,&quot; he says. &quot;Road safety \u2026 does not meet the minimum standards befitting a civilised country and cyclists are always at risk of having an accident in\u00a0the Roman traffic.&quot;Lizzy Davies     Cairo's most fearless road users must be its bakery delivery cyclists. Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images    Cairo  Tell a local that you cycle in Cairo, and more often than not you will be met with a wide-eyed stare. Driving a car is dangerous and frustrating enough, with 42 annual road deaths per 100,000 Egyptians, according to the World Health Organisation. Britain has just 2.75. Cairo&apos;s roads are chaotic, with cars paying little attention to road markings, and gridlocked streets common by mid-afternoon. Lane discipline is not a recognised concept, drivers often reverse down multi-lane highways, and cars will not stop for pedestrians seeking to cross a road until they step out into the speeding traffic. In this environment, there is little concept of cycling as a means of getting across the city. Needless to say, there are no cycle lanes. Many deliverymen do use bikes to pedal around their neighbourhoods \u2013 perhaps Cairo&apos;s most fearless road-users are the cycling bakers who careen through traffic jams balancing vast trays of bread on their heads. But very few commuters cycle, put off by the perceived danger and the\u00a0lack of infrastructure. For some professionals, bikes are associated with the working class, and so have a social stigma \u2013 while some female cyclists report harassment from passersby. But the city&apos;s few energetic bike advocates say that cyclists are slowly on the rise. When the Cairo Cycling Club was founded five years ago, it had just four members. Now it organises weekly recreational group rides through quieter districts that have sometimes attracted hundreds of cyclists. In\u00a0two provincial cities near Cairo, the authorities are planning to encourage more\u00a0cycling along some main roads. There are no exact figures, either for the number of Cairene cyclists or the number of annual cycling-related fatalities. But Ahmed el-Dorghamy, one of Cairo&apos;s most vocal cycling proponents, says there are more than 20,000 users of Egyptian online cycling groups. &quot;The idea we want to get across is that it&apos;s not just a sporting activity,&quot; he told the BBC last year. &quot;It can also be a means of transport in some areas of Cairo.&quot;Patrick Kingsley     New York's busy streets might seem daunting, but things are improving for cyclists. Photograph: Joseph Mcnally/Getty Images    New York If you commute by bike in New York City, you are still regarded by colleagues as something of a daredevil. And if you don&apos;t wear a helmet, they frankly think you are reckless. Mind you, this is a country where they wear helmets for the game they call football (which, actually, does have a serious head-injury problem). But perceptions lag behind reality. New York has become a much more cycle-friendly city over the past decade or so of the Bloomberg administration. Cyclist fatalities have held steady over that time: in a good year, perhaps just a dozen; in a bad year, double that number. But bike use has tripled since 2000 and, with several hundred miles of new bike lanes put in, it is still growing fast. So, according to the City&apos;s &quot;cycling risk indicator&quot;, the danger of serious injury has plummeted by 73% (between 2000 and 2011). And New York is truly a bikeable city. Manhattan and the other boroughs are reasonably flat, and car ownership is the lowest of any American city. The views can be spectacular, whether you are flying down one of the big avenues in a canyon of Gotham skyscrapers or taking the riverside bike path along the Hudson on the west side. Earlier this year, the city got the Citibike bike-share scheme, our equivalent of Boris bikes. Despite teething troubles, the five-month-old rollout is mostly judged a great success \u2013 not least because it has not yet resulted in a single fatality. Not everything is rosy. Transportation Alternatives, NYC&apos;s leading pro-bike campaign, has worked hard recently to make more of an issue of how poorly fatal accidents involving pedestrians or cyclists are often investigated by the NYPD. Just last weekend, an article in the New York Times asked provocatively: &quot;Is it OK to kill cyclists?&quot; But I take heart simply from the fact that the question is being asked: the mindset is\u00a0changing. My main tip from the mean streets: just watch out for the yellow cabs \u2013 they never pull over to drop people off, and passengers will fling the doors open on either side.Matt Seaton is the Guardian&apos;s former cycling columnist and is now an editor at the New York Times.     Tel Aviv's flat, wide-open spaces are ideal for cycling. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Tel Aviv It is flat, sunny and boasts a sweeping promenade hugging long golden beaches. There are 120km of cycle paths threading throughout the city, 1,500 public bikes for hire at an hourly rate, and 3,000 bicycle parking slots. Welcome to Tel Aviv, cycling heaven. That, at least, is the city council&apos;s vision. As part of a plan to turn Tel Aviv into a car-free city, it has promoted two-wheel transport, with the introduction two years ago of Tel-O-Fun, an Israeli version of Boris bikes, available for hire at around \u00a38 for two and a half hours. A network of cycle paths has been established along roads and through parks, and an annual city bike ride attracted 20,000 participants in September (though 42 cyclists were injured). Helmets are encouraged, but not a legal requirement. According to a poll last year, 14% of residents say it&apos;s their main form of transport. But not everyone is in heaven. &quot;A lot of the cycle paths are just painted areas of the pavement, interrupted by bus stops and with pedestrians wandering over them,&quot; says Ruthie Pliskin, a PhD student who cycles to university every day. &quot;Even the paved ones along the roads are often blocked by parked cars. They&apos;re very narrow, and sometimes it&apos;s not even clear which direction you are supposed to cycle.&quot; Despite the city council&apos;s efforts, Pliskin says cycling is still a dangerous activity in Tel Aviv. &quot;But it has the potential to be a great cycling city \u2013 even if you do need eight showers a day in the summer.&quot;Harriet Sherwood Los Angeles Drivers rule Los Angeles, yet on balance the city is surprisingly safe for cycling. An expanding network of bicycle lanes is slowly making parts of LA friendlier to two wheels, turning a once eccentric form of transport almost hip. About two cyclists are killed in traffic-related collisions in LA county each month, out of a total population of 10 million. Per capita, that is a lot better than many other big population centres in the US and elsewhere. The bad news is that 3% of road accident fatalities are cyclists, way above the US&apos;s national figure of 1.7%. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa became evangelical after he fell and broke his arm swerving from a taxi that cut him off on Venice boulevard in 2010. Within two years the city built 123 miles of new bikeways, nearly eight times the rate of the previous 40 years. There are now more than 430 miles of bike paths across the city. Not all cheered. Hollywood complained that a bright green, 6ft-wide lane, which runs for 1.4 miles through downtown&apos;s historic core, ruined the area&apos;s utility as an Anytown, USA, location. Worse, camera lights reflected the green on to everything else, including actors&apos; faces. California&apos;s governor, Jerry Brown, rejected a law obliging motorists to give cyclists at least 3ft of room while passing, or slow down. But advocacy groups such as the LA County Bicycle Coalition, and rider packs known as Midnight Ridazz and Wolfpack Hustle, and programmes such as CicLAvia, appear to be slowly winning the argument. LA&apos;s new mayor, Eric Garcetti, has pledged to continue bike-friendly policies. You still need strong nerves to cycle here. About 22 cyclists a year are killed or badly hurt in LA&apos;s epidemic of hit-and-runs \u2013 there are 20,000 cases annually. Veterans warn that one of the most perilous places is Beverly Hills: few lanes and inconsiderate drivers.Rory Carroll     David Byrne riding his bike in New York. Photograph: Sam Polcer    Why I like cycling in New York CityBy David Byrne I ride everyday in New York City unless it&apos;s pouring rain or snow or the roads are icy \u2013 and that&apos;s actually not often. I\u00a0now know where the protected bike lanes are and I will go a block or two out of my way to use them. The protected ones make a huge difference, though the occasional delivery or municipal vehicle parks in them. Even\u00a0the non-protected lanes \u2013 the ones in green and white paint that run alongside the traffic \u2013 feel much more secure. Having used bikes in London, I&apos;m used to a lack of road space being allocated to cyclists. But it is, yes, a little scary sometimes back in London. We used to do scary quite well in NYC, but we&apos;ve mostly gotten over it. One does have to beware of limo and hire-car drivers who feel they are carrying people more important than us, and watch out for New Jersey plates, as they&apos;ve rarely seen cyclists and pedestrians where they come from. Bike delivery guys riding the wrong way are another hazard, but maybe they&apos;ll fall in line eventually as well. NYC is easy \u2013 it&apos;s dense and fairly flat. The new bike-share program needs to expand and is already hugely popular. I see men in suits using it, so for me that means the whole thing has passed the tipping point and resistance is futile \u2013 best now to figure out how to make it all work. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2013.

At first, said Simon \u2013 who declined to give his surname \u2013 he thought it was a Palestinian missile from Gaza, a short distance along the coast. &quot;I shut the shop and smoked a cigarette to calm myself,&quot; he said. After a few minutes, puzzled he had not heard the air-raid siren, he stuck his head out of his door to see the flaming shell of a car. Its passenger, and the target of the blast, was a member of prominent Israeli crime organisation the Domrani family. The car bomb on Ort Street, close to a school, was not a solitary incident. In the space of a fortnight spanning the final week of October and the beginning of this month, two car bombs detonated in the southern port city, both targeting Domrani family members. Ashkelon is not the only Israeli town to be rocked by mob violence this year. On 7 November, a device attached to the car of a prominent state prosecutor, well-known for pursuing Israel&apos;s crime families, detonated in Tel Aviv. This rise in incidents has inspired a fierce debate that reached a climax last week with a call from Israel&apos;s hawkish public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, for the use of anti-terror tactics usually reserved for Palestinian militants \u2013 including administrative detention \u2013 against Jewish Israeli crime families. As he made his call, several high-profile arrests took place and a number of businesses associated with mobsters were bulldozed in Ashkelon. If one man embodies the country&apos;s reviled organised crime network, it is 38-year-old Shalom Domrani, reputed head of the family that bears his name. It is his war with a former associate that has thrown Israel&apos;s gangsters into an unwelcome spotlight. Domrani was arrested on 9 November with six of his associates. The circumstances of his detention underscore another cause for mounting concern over the activities of organised criminals: the fear that crime families are making money by infiltrating local government. The current case against Domrani is unrelated to gang war. He and his co-accused, Rabbi Yoram Abergil, face charges of issuing threats to another prominent rabbi with a large following in the Negev city of Netivot \u2013 a bullish attempt, it is alleged, to influence the outcome of municipal elections. The difficulty faced by Israel&apos;s police in pursuing organised crime, however, was underlined on Wednesday when Domrani was released from jail to house arrest over the vote-fixing allegations. Ordering the release, Judge Menahem Mizrahi said: &quot;You can&apos;t arrest someone just because of his reputation. There are clear rules, including the existence of evidence, progress in the investigation and a clear reason for the arrest.&quot; A short walk from Simon&apos;s shop, not far from the seafront, is a corner where the restaurant Pasha stood until it was demolished on Tuesday by police officers from Unit 433 \u2013 known as Israel&apos;s FBI. This is the force on the frontline of Israel&apos;s battle against the mob. Benny Jannah, who owned Pasha, complained to the Guardian that he was the victim of a misunderstanding. &quot;The restaurant wasn&apos;t even open yet,&quot; he said, standing several doors down from his destroyed premises. &quot;The police said it had been taken over by the mob. They got it wrong. We have no connection to criminals. They said we had been forced to rent it to some people and we were afraid to speak. It isn&apos;t true!&quot; Whatever the facts of this case, the allegation is unsurprising. In Ashkelon, as elsewhere, Israeli mobsters have targeted businesses for protection rackets, loan sharking and forced takeovers. The roots of the Domrani crime family are to be found in Ashkelon&apos;s impoverished neighbourhood of Shimshon: a place of dilapidated, gimcrack apartment blocks, settled by Sephardic Jews of Moroccan origin, many of whose families arrived in the 1950s \u2013 a group long marginalised in Israeli society. With high unemployment and poor access to the banking system, loan sharking and crime thrived. Always a tough place, Ashkelon earned the nickname &quot;the city without pity&quot; because of the viciousness of its criminal disputes. It was in this environment, it is said, that Domrani emerged as a &quot;soldier&quot;. The public depiction of him in those days is as a small-time gangster who started in the racket of stealing sand from public beaches. Within a decade, the story goes, he had become a household name whose empire spanned protection and illegal gambling parlours. In Shimshon, a mother and her daughter whose family provide legal services to Domrani agreed to speak to the Guardian. &quot;He&apos;s not as bad as people say,&quot; the daughter said. &quot;He helps the poorer people. He sends his &apos;soldiers&apos; around with boxes of vegetables.&quot; So why are the police interested in him? &quot;Well, he is a criminal,&quot; the mother said. &quot;He&apos;s just not responsible for everything that people say he is.&quot; The heavy-set Domrani, like his main rival in the gang war, no longer lives in Ashkelon. His fortified home is in a rural farming settlement, or moshav, a short drive away \u2013 a safer base than the city, which had become too hot for him to live in even before the latest escalation. Amid small houses shaded by trees, Domrani&apos;s tall compound walls are topped with plastic. It is a conspicuous building: CCTV cameras are set at every corner, monitoring approaches to the house. The front door is inscribed with a verse from Psalm 16: &quot;I have set the Lord always before me.&quot; A woman strolling nearby refused to discuss her neighbour. &quot;We don&apos;t talk about that subject,&quot; she said, ending the conversation. Debate over the cause of the current surge in this gang war \u2013 and its unusually brutish violence \u2013 has inspired intense scrutiny among domestic commentators. Israel&apos;s previous surges in criminal violence have been played out with guns and exclusively between gang members. But the availability of explosives and weapons stolen from the Israeli Defence Forces, analysts argue, has changed the nature of gang conflicts. A recent editorial in the Jerusalem Post speculated that there was also an economic motor powering the conflict \u2013 the &quot;nearly inevitable result of Israel&apos;s burgeoning economy. Like all sectors of Israel&apos;s economy, organised crime, too, has enjoyed a major boom.&quot; Amir Zohar, a crime blogger, suggests more personal motives. &quot;There is a lot of money involved. There are a lot of weapons available. And then there is the question of ego. Shalom Domrani&apos;s rival was a former member of his crime family who lives in a neighbouring moshav. For a while Domrani was spending a lot of time in Morocco, which was becoming a colony of Israeli crime families. I can&apos;t put my finger on it precisely, but during that period they became rivals.&quot; Others blame a lack of support for the police. Lior Akerman, a former senior officer in the Shin Bet \u2013 Israel&apos;s national security agency \u2013 complained in the Jerusalem Post: &quot;The government has been neglecting the police for years. While the military has an outrageously large budget, the police barely receives enough to cover its salaries.&quot; Two alleged members of the Domrani gang swept up in the election-rigging affair \u2013 Avner Abargil and Avraham Tanturi \u2013 stood last week in a court in Rishon Lezion for a custody hearing. Tanturi, a burly man with a shaved head, mouthed messages about his remand conditions to his friends. Tanturi&apos;s solicitor, Leah Felus, pointed to a lack of evidence and absence of charges as proof that her client&apos;s arrest was nothing more than a transparent attempt by the authorities to &quot;stem public anxiety in the wake of the bombings&quot;. Back in Ashkelon, the deputy mayor, Efraim Mor, a former senior policeman who worked the beat in Shimshon for several years, explained the new strategy that has brought Ashkelon&apos;s police force and municipality into an alliance targeting the crime families and businesses associated with them. He described the recent demolitions as part of a wider strategy: &quot;The message is very simple. The criminals have crossed a red line with the bombings. We will make this a place where it is hard for criminals to do business. The law will be enforced. We want to say \u2013 it&apos;s not worth it to be here.&quot; Aharonovitch&apos;s call for the use of administrative detention against mobsters was promptly slapped down by government sources in Jerusalem. But Mor is a supporter of any move to strengthen his city&apos;s arsenal against the mob. &quot;We need all the means available in the fight against crime,&quot; he said. &quot;If a criminal sets off a bomb on a public street, it&apos;s no different to terrorism.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-11-21T18:29:00Z", "title": "Israel's growing gang violence leads to calls for anti-terror tactics", "sentences": ["On 7 November, a device attached to the car of a prominent state prosecutor, well-known for pursuing Israel&apos;s crime families, detonated in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/israel-gang-violence-anti-terror-tactics-ashkelon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Iran", "US foreign policy", "Nuclear weapons", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "     Israel swiftly condemned the deal struck in Geneva, with the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, calling it a &quot;historic mistake&quot; and warning that his country would not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Speaking to ministers at the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said: &quot;Today the world has become a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world has taken a significant step toward attaining the most dangerous weapon in the world\u00a0\u2026 Israel is not bound by this agreement. &quot;The Iranian regime is committed to the destruction of Israel and Israel has the right and the obligation to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. As prime minister of Israel, I would like to make it clear: Israel will not allow Iran to develop a military nuclear capability.&quot; Netanyahu, who has staked his premiership on the need to defend Israel against the Iranian threat by military action if necessary, faces further isolation from key allies in the west who brokered and endorsed the diplomatic accord with Tehran. The issue has severely strained relations between Israel and the US over recent weeks. But the prospect of diplomatic alienation did not stop a string of minsters taking to the airwaves to denounce the deal. &quot;If in another five or six years a nuclear suitcase explodes in New York or Madrid, it will be because of the agreement that was signed this morning,&quot; the economy minister, Naftali Bennett, said. &quot;We woke up this morning to a reality in which a bad, a very bad agreement was signed in Geneva.&quot; The foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said Israel needed to reassess its position in the light of the deal. He said: &quot;A situation assessment is needed. Apparently, we are going to have to make decisions, when all the options are on the table.&quot; He added: &quot;Obviously when you look at the smiles of the Iranians over there in Geneva, you realise that this is the Iranians&apos; greatest victory, maybe since the Khomeini revolution, and it doesn&apos;t really change the situation within Iran.&quot; But some analysts suggested that Israel&apos;s options were limited by the west&apos;s consensus on the need for a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. &quot;International legitimacy for a unilateral Israeli attack is reduced significantly. The international community endorses this deal, and so Israel will find it really hard to use military power,&quot; said Yoel Guzansky, former head of the Iran desk in the prime minister&apos;s office and now a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. The deal, he said, was &quot;not perfect, not the deal we prayed for, but it&apos;s not as bad as some as saying this morning&quot;. The justice minister, Tzipi Livni, suggested Israel needed to repair its relations with the US and seek tactical alliances elsewhere on Iran. &quot;After the signing of this agreement, Israel has to look ahead: to act in close co-operation with the United States, to strengthen that strategic alliance, and to create a political front with other countries as well, such as Arab countries that see a nuclear Iran as a threat,&quot; she said But the prospects of an alliance between Israel and the Gulf states should not be exaggerated, said Guzansky. &quot;The Gulf states don&apos;t like this agreement, but not necessarily for the same reasons [as Israel]. The fact is, Iran will be less isolated \u2013 this threatens the Gulf states. So there is a place for co-operation. But any suggestion that Israel could look for other allies is not serious. Israel now needs to repair the damage [with the US],&quot; he said. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born Israeli analyst, stressed the agreement was interim, but &quot;as an interim deal, it&apos;s a good deal. It halts the more sensitive parts of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. But we have to see what kind of final deal is reached.&quot; He added: &quot;The sanctions relief element of the deal is so small it&apos;s almost symbolic. Iran needs far more than that, so it will take the deal seriously and come back to the negotiating table in six months. This is a promising initial step, but there are many challenges ahead.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-11-24T11:34:30Z", "title": "Israel condemns Iran nuclear deal as 'historic mistake'", "sentences": ["The international community endorses this deal, and so Israel will find it really hard to use military power,&quot; said Yoel Guzansky, former head of the Iran desk in the prime minister&apos;s office and now a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/israel-condemns-iran-nuclear-deal-binyamin-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Hassan Rouhani", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "Nuclear weapons"], "article": "It was probably a mixture of good fortune and the dedication of Iran\u2019s new administration that the Geneva \u2018interim\u2019 deal was reached just before Hassan Rouhani was due to give the nation a report he promised during June\u2019s election campaign. Happily, he was therefore able to deliver something on his promise of changing the course of the nuclear issue and easing sanctions. The blockage is not going to be removed but a moratorium on any new measures is still a sign of relief for a regime that was slowly drowning under their growing tide. Iran\u2019s chief diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, spoke of a great victory after signing the Geneva agreement. President Rouhani informed Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that Iran\u2019s right to enrichment had been recognised, and the leader responded positively and expressed the hope the achievement would pave the way for even greater ones. For the regime, Geneva feels already like a moment of truth. Certainly there is relief that more sanctions are off the menu, at least for six months. We can be optimistic that the Iranian government means business, wants to prove the nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful, and that they will carry through an agreement as long as they are given enough to keep their heads high, inside and outside the country. But everyone will recall the bitter moment of accepting UN security council resolution 598 in 1988 ending the Iraq war with Saddam Hussein still in power. Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s steadfast defiance came to an end in Geneva. In times past, he was adamant the best form of defence was attack. When the west refused to provide 20%-enriched uranium for the Tehran Amirabad research reactor, he sided with those who said: \u201cLet\u2019s just go ahead and make our own\u201d. Ayatollah Khamenei also upped the ante by building the fortified, underground Fordo enrichment facility near the holy city of Qom. All this was partially based on a hope that the west would concede more if the Israelis worried about Iran getting closer to bomb-grade material. But the worry proved infectious \u2013 it was shared by the Arabs and the west \u2013 and led rather to pressures for a snakehold on the Iranian economy in the form of unprecedented, tightening sanctions. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should be given considerable credit for these back-breaking sanctions due to his inflammatory rhetoric towards Israel and the United States. At first, Ahmadinejad\u2019s bombast suited Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s plan, as it encouraged Israel to talk about attacking Iran, but then American officials started touring world capitals asking for cooperation on sanctions to prevent an Israeli attack \u2013 helping increase Middle Eastern tensions and putting Iran and its Sunni Arab neighbours on a collision course. The grip of sanctions created hardship for all Iranians, and it soon became clear the previous approach had reached its expiry date. Hence Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s \u201cheroic flexibility\u201d \u2013 which means accepting reality and adjusting your expectations and calculations accordingly. Hopefully it&apos;s not too late.\u00a0 A glance at Iran\u2019s list of \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cmust not\u201d requirements from Geneva makes clear Tehran did not get the upper hand, and it is hard to detect the \u2018win- win\u2019 situation Rouhani has spoken of on so many occasions. Naturally there is scope for interpretation based on one\u2019s views and interests. The acceptance of enrichment up to 5% has been seen in Tehran \u2013 and among hardliners in Tel Aviv and Riyadh \u2013 as a victory for Iran. But at the same time, the curbs and limits on the Iranian nuclear programme are so severe as to be almost equivalent to stopping it. The daily access of UN inspectors to Natanz and Fordo, the ban on enrichment above 5% and the conversion of the entire stockpile of enriched to 20%, all reflect the realisation of the Iranian regime that it can go no further with the policies that predated \u201cheroic flexibility\u201d. Of course, Iran will receive $7billion in return (its own money, seized abroad). And there will be no new \u201cnuclear related\u201d sanctions. Restrictions on precious metals and airplane parts will be eased, and there will be some relief over money transfers for students and people facing medical bills. Far from wriggling off the sanctions hook, Iran will find its revenues remain heavily dented with oil sales not allowed to increase after being cut back 60% in 18 months. Looking on the bright side, this could be an opener, a deal to test the water. It may even succeed in building mutual trust if all parties involved can move from a mindset that wants to put Iran under duress. Geneva has also put Binyamin Netanyahu\u00a0in a tricky position, as the world cannot allow itself to be taken hostage by his manifest intransigence. But in the cold light of day, are the prospects for the deal so promising? If the Americans signed hoping to curb Iran nuclear programme for six months, and then after the six months to extend the freeze, well then they have made a big mistake. If the majority of sanctions remain in place and are not in time removed, then other world players will see Washington\u2019s double standards. And this would put pressure on Rouhani\u2019s team to do what Iran did after Ahmadinejad came to power: end the freeze on enrichment, break the IAEA seals, and resume suspended nuclear activities with a new vigour. Have no doubt that Rouhani, who gave a lot of ground in Geneva, has exposed himself to hardliners who will attack him aggressively both for bringing the nuclear programme to a sort of voluntary halt and for giving unprecedented outside access. Kayhan, a hardline newspaper whose editor-in-chief Hossein Shariatmadari is appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei, has already chosen a controversial front-page headline: \u2018Geneva Agreement Last an Hour!\u2019 This referred to John Kerry saying the signed document had not recognised Iran\u2019s right to enriching uranium, which was of course the very victory the Iranian negotiating team and president had claimed. For Shariatmadari this is no doubt just the beginning. It is hard to see how Iran can return to the defiance he advocates, but the problems ahead in reaching a comprehensive deal may slowly increase regional tension and give him further material for headlines. Among the Iranian people, there is already an overwhelming mixture of joy that no new sanctions will be imposed and hope that the situation will ease further. There is relief that the wind from Geneva has pushed away the clouds of war with Israel and the United States. But people know winds can change course, and that Rouhani\u2019s position is precarious.

The accord reached in Geneva on Sunday morning represents a first, six-month phase of a process in which Iran will accept limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. According to US calculations, the interim deal will be worth up to $7bn (\u00a34.3bn) to Iran, made up of $4.2bn in Iranian oil sales revenue unblocked from frozen accounts; $1bn repatriated from petrochemical sales; a possible $500m in extra production and sales by the Iranian car industry due to the lifting of the ban on imports of car parts; and the unblocking of $400m in Iranian frozen assets to help pay the costs of Iranian students abroad. A suspension on a ban on Iran&apos;s trade in gold and other precious metals is expected to bring in smaller amounts. France&apos;s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said EU ministers would discuss the lifting of partial sanctions as early as December and that a &quot;Europe-wide&quot; decision was necessary for easing some of the punitive measures that the EU has imposed on Tehran. &quot;[That meeting] is expected in several weeks, for a partial lifting that is limited, targeted and reversible,&quot; he told radio station Europe 1. The Geneva deal, struck between Iran and a six-nation group comprising the US, three European states, Russia and China, mediated by the EU&apos;s foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, is expected to trigger a flurry of diplomacy. This will include an EU initiative to try to reassure Iran&apos;s regional rivals, enemies and sceptics, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, of the value of an agreement that, for the first time in a decade, has Tehran agreeing to roll back its nuclear projects under intrusive daily inspection by United Nations monitors. European and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts are to confer this week on how to verify the implementation of the accord in Iran, which will rely heavily on IAEA expertise and manpower to inspect Iran&apos;s nuclear-related sites. Diplomatic efforts will also be made to bolster Iranian reformists under President Hassan Rouhani to try to reinforce his flanks against a conservative backlash in Iran. &quot;The [Iranian] government can show they are really delivering on their promise to improve relations with the west,&quot; said a senior diplomat. &quot;I hope it will change Iran&apos;s relations, particularly with the west, for the better. This will hopefully recreate more confidence and trust. I know that for countries in the region there are other issues that are very important \u2013 that is Iran&apos;s regional role.&quot; Ashton and the six-nation group will soon start work preparing further negotiations with the Iranians with a view to sealing a final settlement within six months. The task could be far more challenging than clinching the interim accord as it will involve tackling issues that were set aside during the past few months&apos; deliberations as being too hard to solve. At some stage, say sources, those negotiations will have to tackle suspected military aspects of the nuclear programme that go back years and have never been clarified, concerning the Parchin military complex, for example. Western diplomats say that the Geneva deal was achieved in the nick of time as Iran&apos;s enrichment capacity and its stockpiles of enriched uranium were escalating at such a rate that the country would soon have had the capacity to assemble nuclear weapons in a matter of weeks if it had chosen to break out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. &quot;It is a first important step,&quot; said the senior diplomat of the weekend agreement. &quot;If we had not been able to agree that step and the Iranian programme had progressed the way it has been progressing in the last months, this would have significantly increased the break-out capability.&quot; Fabius assured Israel that Paris would be protecting its security in the Middle East, but said he did not think Tel Aviv would seek military action against the Islamic republic because, if it did, &quot;no one would understand it&quot;. Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has called the Geneva agreement an &quot;historic mistake&quot;. He announced on Monday that he would be sending a team to Washington to discuss the Iran deal. &quot;I spoke last night with President Obama. We agreed that, in the coming days, an Israeli team led by the national security adviser, Yossi Cohen, will go out to discuss with the United States the permanent accord with Iran,&quot; he said. But Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, told parliament on Monday : &quot;We would discourage anybody in the world, including Israel, from taking any steps that would undermine this agreement and we will make that very clear to all concerned. &quot;The fact we have achieved for the first time in nearly a decade an agreement that halts and rolls back Iran&apos;s nuclear programme should give us heart this work can be done and that a comprehensive agreement can be attained.&quot; Iran&apos;s negotiating team, led by its foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, returned home on Sunday night from Switzerland to a hero&apos;s welcome at Tehran&apos;s Mehrabad airport. Upon arriving in Tehran, Zarif updated his Facebook page, which has been &quot;liked&quot; by 700,000 people, apologising to his supporters that bodyguards did not allow him to spend time with them at the airport. &quot;It is 10:45pm Sunday night. Just arrived at home. Before posting a report drafted in airplane, I would like to thank all present in airport for welcoming us,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I am very sorry that our guardsmen wouldn&apos;t let me get out of the automobile.&quot; His message post, Zarif talked about the tensions behind the smiles and laughs shown on camera worldwide. Zarif said: &quot;The art of a diplomat is to conceal all the turbulences behind his smile.&quot; He called on his critics in Iran to be fair and consider the country&apos;s national interests. &quot;You should be alert that Zionists and other warmongers are all extremely on edge and they would spare no pretext and device to bring a deal \u2013 dubbed a deal of the century for Iran \u2013 to nothing,&quot; he wrote. Zarif&apos;s smiling face dominated the front pages in Tehran, with two reformist newspapers, Etemaad and Shargh, publishing the picture of his handshake with his American counterpart, John Kerry. Conservative newspapers also ran headlines suportive of Zarif&apos;s diplomacy, apart from Kayhan, a hardline newspaper whose director is appointed by supreme leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei. &quot;The US is not to be trusted,&quot; read its deadline. Sadeq Zibakalam, a prominent analyst at Tehran University, told Deutsche Welle&apos;s Persian service: &quot;Geneva showed that people in Iran are tired of radicalism. We will see more newspapers in stands, less censorship by the cultural ministry and release of more political prisoners.&quot; Zibakalam said he thought the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and Mousavi&apos;s wife, Zahra Rahnavard, would also be lifted in the coming months.

Weighing in at 30lbs, it was one of a dozen or so sustainable transport options being exhibited at the summit on the 12 to 13 November as part of the Israeli government&apos;s fuel choices initiative. There were spaceship-like, solar-powered overhead transport pods for cities, cars running on a battery powered by fresh air from a company called Phinergy, and a detachable electric battery which can be fixed to any bicycle from a venture named Cycli. The battery is expected to be on the market next year for about $300. The Muv-e creation can be folded and wheeled on to public transport and is also due on the market next year for around $2,000 to $3,000, with a battery radius of roughly 7 miles. Also, on show was BeemCar, a proposed alternative to light rail, run on solar panels and designed to travel overhead in busy cities. It would offer 67% energy savings over an urban bus, say its creators. The Israeli government is serious about becoming fuel independent as soon as possible, with a focus on ensuring 60% of energy in transport comes from the renewables sector by 2025. As part of the government&apos;s fuel choices initiative, launched in 2010, several sustainable energy technology pilots are being supported with a mixture of government and venture capital investment. Israel has become known for its tech start ups, even if the best ones are often bought in their infancy by US companies. In August, the Boston Globe said the start up scene in Tel Aviv was second only to Silicon Valley. And, in March, Apple announced it would be opening its third Israeli-based R&amp;D centre, in Ra&apos;anana, a Tel Aviv suburb. So, what is creating such a throng of activity in Israel? &quot;There is a strong entrepreneurial vibe here,&quot; says Joanna Landau, founder of Kinetis, an organisation which sets about promoting Israel as somewhere which isn&apos;t just about conflict. &quot;Our grandparents kind of created Israel as a start up in the forties. They were creating everything from scratch and they left an entrepreneurial legacy. That&apos;s the spirit we have here. We&apos;re a small place, with eight million people, and we&apos;re very close knit. And, a lot of innovations, like those in water recycling and drip irrigation have been a matter of survival.&quot; Mandatory military service often brings people even more closely together, and a number of start ups happen during or after service between groups of people who&apos;ve met while serving, Landau told me and a group of sustainability writers on a recent tour of the country. The drive towards energy independence is bringing all sorts of developments in Israel&apos;s solar industry too. Since the country&apos;s early days solar power has been harnessed and now, 90% of homes have solar panels to heat their water. Down in the Arava desert there is a cluster of companies making strides in this space, aiming to take the region towards complete energy independence in the next 18 months. One of the most prominent, the Arava Power Company is planning the Middle East&apos;s first commercial solar farm, after five years of battling government legislation. Its pilot site has 16,000 solar panels and generates 9m k/w hours of energy a year. It was set up on the Kibbutz Ketura by Yosef Abramowitz \u2013 a Jewish American, named one of the world&apos;s six leading green pioneers by CNN last year. &quot;We&apos;re looking at a commercial site which will straddle Israel and Jordan and it&apos;s expected to grow to a $2bn entity,&quot; said Abramowitz. &quot;Between all the solar programmes in this region, we will hopefully be carbon neutral in 18 months,&quot; he says. Kibbutz sites are a noticeable hotbed of sustainable innovation as you look around Israel. While some struggle with growing costs and more people to support, the most forward-thinking are inputting energy-free air-conditioning systems \u2013 Neot Semadar, fully solar-powered cafes and modern housing made from recycled materials \u2013 Kibbutz Lotan. And, at Ketura, along with the solar plant, there is Algatech, an algae farm, set up to provide green fuel, food and animal feed, just using sun. It has sold all its expected output two years in advance of production. The venture is part of the government&apos;s fuel choices initiative. &quot;I think it&apos;s not a coincidence that we have so many sustainable initiatives here on the Kibbutz,&quot; says our guide Yuval Ben Chai. &quot;We are based on co-operation and the Kibbutz is a place that truly gives space for people&apos;s ideas and dreams. And, I think it couldn&apos;t be done in any other place.&quot; Once Kibbutz culture is added into the mix, it&apos;s even clearer to see why start ups have such fertile ground in Israel. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November to correct the name of the algae farm from UniVerve Biofuel to Algatech and to correct the attribution of the quote &quot;I think it&apos;s not a coincidence that we have so many sustainable initiatives here on the Kibbutz,&quot; from &quot;Ohad Zuckerman, one of the founders of the algae venture&quot; to &quot;our guide Yuval Ben Chai&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T18:23:00Z", "title": "Israel's drive for energy independence creating wave of sustainable start ups", "sentences": ["Outside Israel&apos;s first ever fuel choices summit in Tel Aviv, earlier this month, delegates zipped around Habima Square on a futuristic-looking Muv-e, a portable, lightweight, electric scooter designed to travel at up to 25mph.", "In August, the Boston Globe said the start up scene in Tel Aviv was second only to Silicon Valley.", "And, in March, Apple announced it would be opening its third Israeli-based R&amp;D centre, in Ra&apos;anana, a Tel Aviv suburb."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/israel-energy-sustainable-start-ups"}, {"tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Culture", "Music"], "article": "&apos;It was a ludicrous progression that I went into the Wagner repertoire with Hans Sachs first,&quot; laughs baritone Gerald Finley. &quot;And now Amfortas in Parsifal? This is not the natural evolution for a singer like me. There are\u00a0other roles that usually come first. But sometimes in this career the step-by-step approach isn&apos;t the way it works\u00a0out.&quot; In fact, Finley&apos;s career does read like a catalogue of orderly advancement. A\u00a0leading chorister at King&apos;s College, Cambridge and a star of the Royal College of Music, he emerged from the Glyndebourne chorus as Figaro to sing the very first words heard at their new opera house in 1994. He has created contemporary roles in new operas by\u00a0John Adams and Mark-Anthony Turnage while simultaneously building a reputation as a leading Mozartian. He\u00a0has won Grammy and Gramophone awards for opera and recital recordings and later this season will celebrate 25 years at the Royal Opera House. Next week will see his 100th performance at Covent Garden in his debut production of Wagner&apos;s grail saga, Parsifal, in which he is the physically and morally wounded king, Amfortas. The role follows his acclaimed Hans Sachs in the 2011 Glyndebourne Meistersinger. But look just beneath the surface of\u00a0Finley&apos;s apparently smooth CV and there is much that has not been by the book. One of his signature roles is Don Giovanni \u2013 he recently featured in no fewer than five productions in just two\u00a0years \u2013 but he didn&apos;t actually learn the part until he was 40. Finley has endured two significant vocal crises in\u00a0his career and was so in awe of the\u00a0great German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau that for many years it distorted his own potential repertoire. Such was his trepidation before taking on the demanding role of Sachs that his wife even bought him a book called Wagner Without Fear. &quot;As with so many things, the Wagner eventually came about through a combination of opportunity and practicality,&quot; he explains. &quot;Sachs was on\u00a0my list for later in my career, but Glyndebourne was the perfect venue for Meistersinger in that it is a relatively small auditorium where the stage is not\u00a0too deep. That means you would necessarily be towards the front and so\u00a0volume was never going to be an issue.&quot; And, as Glyndebourne has been a reassuring home from home to him throughout his career, so he is similarly surrounded by long-standing colleagues for his Covent Garden Parsifal, most notably conductor Antonio Pappano. &quot;I first met Tony when he was looking for a Giovanni for a concert tour in the Middle East. You&apos;d think it was a bread-and-butter piece, but we were both 40 and it had never crossed our paths. So in Tel Aviv we sang the Don together every day for about three weeks in this bunker-like rehearsal room and got to know each other pretty well, both as people and as musicians. He&apos;s been amazingly supportive ever since, and so doing Amfortas with him is both comforting, and also challenging as he&apos;s not afraid to really demand of me in front of the entire cast. But because I trust implicitly what he wants, and the results that he gets, he is bringing more out of me than even I knew was there.&quot; Finley says for years the combination of enjoying the work he was doing allied to a sense of Wagner as a &quot;psychological fortress&quot; ensured he largely steered clear of the music. &quot;But people did keep saying that not only would I enjoy it, it would help me open up as an artist. And so ultimately I thought if this is going to help me sing better, why am I resisting? Something like Amfortas is not a long role, but it is very condensed, with a great deal of passion and some wonderfully lyrical lines. And the power of the\u00a0music is palpable.&quot; He observes in\u00a0his colleagues, some of whom have given 50-plus performances, &quot;that they love to come to rehearsal, and they feel that the music is essentially part of their existence. They feel the uplift and are invigorated by it. And I&apos;m sure that being united with the music is a constant that somehow helps them cope with the very disjointed life of the singer, which can be a lot about travel, separation from those you love and being a long way from home.&quot; Finley&apos;s first home was in Canada \u2013 although he now lives in Sussex \u2013 where he was born in 1960 and brought up in Ottawa. There were several musicians in his wider family and from the age of 10 he was singing treble in a renowned Anglican church choir. &quot;Which showed how much I loved the music as it wasn&apos;t easy in Canada to be a choirboy whose voice hadn&apos;t broken when all your friends were playing ice hockey and football. I liked all those things too, but there just weren&apos;t enough hours in the day to fit with my\u00a0commitment to the choir.&quot; When his voice eventually did break, comparatively late at 16, he moved straight to the bass section and by the time he was 18 was deciding whether he should pursue a career in veterinary science or music. &quot;I went for music, but even then, while I hoped my voice would take me into the musical world, I never thought it would be the prime element of my work. If anything, I wanted to be a choral conductor, and that was what I\u00a0had in mind when I went to the UK.&quot; An audition for the Royal College of\u00a0Music had been arranged via a relative who had been an organist at Westminster Abbey. But, on arrival in London, Finley was also invited to sing at King&apos;s College, Cambridge, where he spent the next three years \u2013 which included performing alongside Janet Baker, who became an early supporter \u2013 before returning to the Royal College where by all accounts he was a particularly assured student. &quot;Well, I was connected to the professional choir scene because of King&apos;s. And back then that meant you could step in and be a deputy around the place and so could earn a living.&quot; He joined the chorus at Glyndebourne, which also meant becoming an understudy and Finley was given the chance to sing in an early rehearsal of Albert Herring because the principal was getting married. &quot;And straight away you know people are thinking &apos;Finley, hmm \u2026&apos; Those little opportunities are very important and it makes me angry when I see young singers who don&apos;t know the music backwards when chances come along. A couple of times my own understudies haven&apos;t been prepared when really they should have been throwing me out of a job. And if you put in the work, things can turn out well.&quot; In his case he was soon singing around the world in both the core repertoire, especially Mozart, at the same time as taking on new work from Turnage \u2013 The Silver Tassie, about a footballer injured in the first world war and then Anna Nicole \u2013 as well as John Adams, for whom he originated the part of Oppenheimer in Dr Atomic. &quot;I like it that we have stories from today that can be reflected or discussed or approached via contemporary music, voice and theatre. But you do attempt to look at any material as if it was the first night. You try to think of Wagner&apos;s notes as still being wet on the page, and you try to connect musically with people in a\u00a0way that perhaps they haven&apos;t experienced before. The difference is that every now and again Mark Turnage would call out, &apos;Gerry, we&apos;re going to change that note&apos;, in a way that Wagner doesn&apos;t. So you see the composer adjusting, hopefully for the better, in\u00a0response to what one is offering.&quot; He says that he will probably take on\u00a0fewer new roles in the future as he\u00a0seeks to manage his voice through potentially another two decades of\u00a0singing. It was while he was at Glyndebourne in his late 20s that he had his first vocal crisis, when he realised he was over-reliant on choral techniques. He spent a year with a voice coach &quot;putting together a voice that was founded on breath and muscle, which shattered my lieder singing completely but enabled me to do the Figaros and a lot of the other roles I\u00a0sang in the first part of my career.&quot; He claims being a singer is less like being a dancer \u2013 &quot;who are always dancing through pain and injury&quot; \u2013 than a tennis player. &quot;You can carry on, and make compensations, for a long time when the muscles are out of kilter. But eventually things will just not work any more.&quot; In his case a blood vessel broke on his vocal cord. &quot;And that provided an\u00a0opportunity to think about the fundamentals, something that doesn&apos;t often come for a singer in mid-career because you are usually so busy. Like a\u00a0tennis player who&apos;s always wanted to\u00a0get that serve just right, when recovering from injury you can work on the mechanics without the pressure of performing and earning a living.&quot; When he re-emerged, he found himself better able to return to one of his early musical inspirations. &quot;I saw Fischer-Dieskau sing when I was a student and was utterly captivated. For 10 years I wanted to be like him, but couldn&apos;t, and therefore tied myself in\u00a0complete knots. After the vocal problems I realised that I have a love of both opera and of lieder but I only have one voice, so I have to sing it all the same way.&quot; Finley will release a CD of Schubert&apos;s Winterreise \u2013 recorded many times by\u00a0Fischer-Dieskau \u2013 in the new year to\u00a0coincide with a residency at the Wigmore Hall with his regular accompanist Julius Drake, that will also take in work by Sibelius and Liszt. &quot;My recital work is essential because it allows me to dwell on my own artistic interests. Julius is like a musical brother and he understands that I\u00a0now\u00a0have to supply new vocal resources for dealing with either big climaxes or Mahlerian suspensions. And I&apos;m learning all the time how to use the\u00a0equipment I have.&quot; Other immediate plans include a Covent Garden Marriage of Figaro, a Cunning Little Vixen in Vienna and his first full opera in Canada for 21 years for his debut as Falstaff. &quot;Falstaff and Iago will be my Verdi roles over the next few years. As for other things, if there is a Scarpia out there somewhere I&apos;d be happy to do that, too, and I am not doing any Wagner roles that would preclude Mozart. But the fundamental thing is to find out where my voice flourishes. And you can&apos;t deny that doing something like Amfortas helps with that. The revelation to me \u2013 particularly in Meistersinger \u2013 is that when I am singing it is usually with just parts of the orchestra, rarely the full sound. So the vocal delivery isn&apos;t about planting your feet and bawling it out, and that reassured me that Wagner was about making singing really valuable. And so now I feel I&apos;ve joined the Wagner train and I have a valid ticket. It&apos;s a pretty long train, admittedly, but I&apos;m comfortable on it and feel I can stay around. Amfortas and Hans Sachs will be roles that I sing for the rest of my life.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T18:45:00Z", "title": "Gerald Finley: 'I feel I've joined the Wagner train and I have a valid ticket'", "sentences": ["So in Tel Aviv we sang the Don together every day for about three weeks in this bunker-like rehearsal room and got to know each other pretty well, both as people and as musicians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/29/gerald-finley-opera-wagner-covent-garden"}, {"tags": ["Hezbollah", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "World news"], "article": "A senior Hezbollah commander has been shot dead outside his south Beirut apartment in the biggest blow to the secretive Shia militia since its then military commander was assassinated by a car bomb in the city six years ago. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the killing, saying it had twice before tried and failed to target Hassan Howlo al-Laqqis, who is understood to have been the group&apos;s overall logistics and procurement chief. But a previously unknown Sunni group claimed responsibility for the brazen attack on Hezbollah&apos;s home turf, underlining the Shia militia&apos;s deepening entanglement in a regional sectarian conflict. Before Laqqis&apos;s funeral in Hezbollah&apos;s Beeka valley heartland, a statement from the militant group said Israel &quot;should bear full responsibility and all the consequences of this heinous crime and its repeated targeting of dear resistance leaders and cadres&quot;. Israeli officials denied any involvement. &quot;Unequivocally no. We had nothing to do with it,&quot; said Israel&apos;s energy minister, Silvan Shalom. &quot;The Salafists over there did it,&quot; he added, referring to a fundamentalist Sunni insurgency in Syria and Lebanon that has in recent months vowed to take the fight to the Shia Hezbollah. An unknown group claiming to represent Lebanese Sunni interests took to Twitter to claim responsibility for the killing. In late November, another Sunni group, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, used the same forum to claim it had sent two suicide bombers to blow up the Iranian embassy in Beirut, an attack that killed more than 20 people, including a diplomat and up to four Hezbollah guards. Renowned for its secrecy and discipline, Hezbollah closely guards its inner secrets, particularly its military command structure and the identities of senior militants who lead operations against Israel and, increasingly, against groups fighting the regime of its key backer, Syria&apos;s president, Bashar al-Assad. Laqqis is understood to have held a position on the group&apos;s Jihad Council, which gave him a stake in the group&apos;s strategic decision-making and in devising military tactics. Sources in Beirut said his status had grown steadily since the assassination of Hezbollah&apos;s former overall military chief, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed by a car bomb detonated by Israeli agents in central Damascus in February 2008. Unlike that killing, however, Laqqis&apos;s death triggered few rumours in Tel Aviv of Israeli involvement. &quot;And the question that is being asked is who did this,&quot; said a source with connections to Israeli security figures. &quot;This one looks homegrown.&quot; In recent months, various Sunni groups, some al-Qaida-aligned jihadists and others more closely linked to the Syrian opposition, have sworn vengeance against Hezbollah for the prominent role it has taken in defending the Assad regime. The group&apos;s forces were largely responsible for capturing the Syrian border town of Qusayr in June and are prominent in fighting now taking place around Damascus, in the Qalamoun Mountains near the Lebanese border and in Aleppo in northern Syria. After initially denying it had taken a stake in the Syrian civil war, Hassan Nasrallah spent more than two years conditioning his followers to focus on a new enemy \u2013 Sunni jihadists, who he claimed were trying to bring a sectarian war to Lebanon. However, his claim to be fighting a defensive war in Syria has been scorned by much of the Sunni world, which sees Hezbollah as a direct proxy of Iran&apos;s Shia Islamic leaders. While Hezbollah has also lost several leaders on the battlefields of Syria, it has historically reacted viscerally to assassinations in its territory. Despite reported efforts in Israel and Europe, it has so far failed to avenge the death of Mughniyeh. &quot;As far as we&apos;re concerned, we&apos;re not particularly sorry of course, but we had nothing to do with it,&quot; said Shalom, of Laqqis&apos;s death. &quot;Of course Hezbollah does not want to show its inferiority. It is taking blow after blow. Hundreds of its members have been killed in Syria, more than the number killed in the war against us. &quot;This was a major blow so it is trying to show his assassination as part of the war against Israel and not as a domestic war.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-12-04T17:05:46Z", "title": "Hezbollah suffers heaviest blow in years as commander is shot dead in Beirut", "sentences": ["Unlike that killing, however, Laqqis&apos;s death triggered few rumours in Tel Aviv of Israeli involvement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/hezbollah-commander-shot-dead-beirut-shia-israel-sunni"}, {"tags": ["Amanda Palmer", "Music", "Neil Gaiman", "Books", "Performance art", "Art", "Culture", "Art and design"], "article": "Over the past few years Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman have become a kind of Kim and Kanye for the Comic Con classes, a pair whose couplehood now almost transcends their individual fame.

He: the 53-year-old British graphic novelist beloved for Coraline and The Sandman series.

Though he reads from behind a lectern, it sounds as if it&apos;s fireside \u2013 he lilts through his cadences, sonorous and theatrical. He sings, too \u2013 they open with the duet Making Whoopee. &quot;You know, I think I was actually better when I wasn&apos;t as good,&quot; he tells me later. &quot;Because when I wasn&apos;t as good and obviously completely terrified, you get the entire 2,000 people just rooting for me.&quot; But this audience couldn&apos;t be rooting for both of them harder. The show is shambolic, in that welcome-to-our-living-room way that Palmer \u2013 who really has played fans&apos; living rooms \u2013 is so loved for. Readings and songs are punctuated by confusion over the whereabouts of mic stands, for example, and the crowd loves it. I think they would love it even if the two passed three hours on stage picking their noses.

Palmer is in a torn khaki T-shirt and last night&apos;s eyeliner (&quot;we&apos;ve been awake about 20 minutes&quot;) and he, as ever, is all in black. &quot;Everybody there wants to feel very together,&quot; says Palmer, when I mention the intense fandom of the night before, &quot;and there&apos;s such a community vibe that when you start to segment it, people all of a sudden feel they&apos;re not invited to the party.&quot; As she talks I notice something keeps attracting and holding her attention on the wall to my right. It&apos;s a large mirror. Over the next hour and a half her own reflection is the recipient of a lot of eye contact. Palmer and Gaiman&apos;s relationship began over email. He blogged about liking a song of hers, she sent him a thank-you note and a correspondence was born. Eventually she asked him to caption a series of photographs she had taken of herself dead, originally meant to accompany her first solo album, 2008&apos;s Who Killed Amanda Palmer.      &quot;And I wrote back and said, yeah, because nobody had ever asked me to write captions for photographs of themselves dead.&quot; It was platonic and when they finally met in person (where else but the green room of New York&apos;s Comic Con), &quot;I didn&apos;t even think she was cute.&quot; &quot;He looked like hell,&quot; she says.

I just thought: &apos;I want to look after you.&apos; And I didn&apos;t actually do anything ...&quot; He notices the wildly skeptical face she&apos;s pulling. &quot;I didn&apos;t!&quot; he protests. &quot;Sooooo not true,&quot; she says. She turns to me: &quot;Neil told me as I came off stage that night he would marry me.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think I said it out loud ...&quot; A few months later, she agreed to date him. &quot;I wooed her,&quot; he says, proudly. They quibble over which occasion qualifies as their first date. &quot;We didn&apos;t go anywhere,&quot; he says, when she suggests it was a night in LA where Gaiman, in his own words, &quot;being chivalrous and noble and English&quot;, surprised her with a two-bed suite on the last night of a tour. &quot;You have to go somewhere for it to be a date.&quot; The suite&apos;s second bed turned out to be just a sofa. &quot;So,&quot; he says, &quot;that felt like the universe telling us we should probably sleep in the same bed. Which we did. And ...&quot; She chips in: &quot;It was our first exercise in realising that our sexual chemistry was very awkward.&quot; &quot;Incredibly awkward,&quot; he agrees. And then, sounding surprised. &quot;It&apos;s got quite good since.&quot; &quot;It has, it&apos;s got really fantastic since, but he was used to making out with people in an entirely different way.&quot; &quot;Oh God!&quot; he cries with a visible cringe. &quot;See? It gets much, much, much too ...&quot; &quot;You wanted to tell the entire story,&quot; she says. &quot;No, I didn&apos;t, I just wanted to tell the funny bit about the bed.&quot;     Palmer and Gaiman in Art Spiegelman's flat: 'I think Neil's fans are more rabid.' Photograph: Timothy Fadek for the Guardian    In January of 2010 they got engaged and were married a year later. They remain as smoochy with each other as adolescents. Performative, perhaps, but I find it sweet. Both, in fact, seem teenager-ish in their sensibilities \u2013 here, for example, is how Gaiman describes himself in his Twitter bio: &quot;Will eventually grow up and get a real job. Until then, will keep making things up and writing them down.&quot; Those made-up things include comics, graphic novels, six books of fiction, 15 young adult works, several screenplays and a trove of short stories. His latest novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, debuted at No 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. He is probably the higher profile of the two, although it seems her fans are fiercer. He agrees. &quot;Yeah. Her fans.&quot; &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; she says. &quot;I think his are more rabid.&quot; She adds: &quot;You rarely see men saying: &apos;I want to feel about my wife the way Neil Gaiman feels about his wife.&apos; But you do see a lot of women going: &apos;I can&apos;t wait to find a husband like Neil Gaiman!&apos; But I think that could also be that I reveal a lot more about the inner workings of the marriage and Neil&apos;s more stand-offish.&quot; He mumbles, through a rice cake, something that sounds like &quot;embarrassed&quot;. &quot;Embarrassed?&quot; I say. &quot;British,&quot; Palmer corrects me. He swallows his rice cake. &quot;I said embarrassed, but either will work. We both have our lines in the sand on how much we communicate to the internet, it&apos;s just, you know, my line in the sand is in Brighton and hers is in Plymouth.&quot; The two have an open marriage, of which Gaiman has said: &quot;We would not allow another relationship to imperil what we have. We talk. And talk. And talk. And hug a lot. And talk some more. And then do whatever needs to be done in the real world.&quot; But the difficulties and delicacies of polyamory must be compounded by their other very open relationship, the one they have with their public. She has close to a million Twitter followers, his number almost two million and they talk to them all the time. &quot;There&apos;s an art or a skill that there really isn&apos;t a name for yet,&quot; Palmer says, &quot;but it&apos;s how to negotiate the intimacies of your real-life relationships and the intimacies of your internet sphere. Neil and I learned this lesson early on \u2013 you don&apos;t complain about the marriage on Twitter.&quot; She has said before that,&quot;when I go to the other room to Twitter with my followers, it feels like sneaking off for a quick shag&quot;. She laughs when I remind her of this, but says: &quot;If you look at the Twitter feed as just another relationship that you dominate and it feeds your ego, it does have that sense of: &apos;I&apos;m tired of reality over here, I&apos;m just going to run across the street and go where it&apos;s simple.&apos;&quot; Twitter, though, is by no means always a refuge for her. There was the post-Kickstarter scandal last year, where, having raised a then unprecedented amount of money ($1.2m) for her new album, she asked musicians to play for free on her tour, or at least, in exchange for &quot;beer, hugs and high fives&quot;. &quot;Pretty much everybody on Earth has a threshold for how much to indulge an idiot who doesn&apos;t know how to conduct herself,&quot; Steve Albini wrote, &quot;and I think Ms Palmer has found her audience&apos;s threshold.&quot;     Palmer and Gaiman perform a free show for fans in Tel Aviv, October 2013. Photograph: Guy Prives    Then, last April, in the wake of the Boston marathon bombings, she published &apos;a poem for dzhokhar&apos;, a seemingly sympathetic address to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old charged with co-perpetrating the attacks that killed three people and injured more than 200 others. As both literature and gesture it was almost universally deplored and derided. The parodies included one Poem for Amanda Palmer, which begins: &quot;you don&apos;t know that there are ways of responding to a tragedy without being narcissistic and self-serving / you don&apos;t know how a national crisis and the death of at least three innocent people could not be about you.&quot; I put to her the possibility that the devotion of her fans functions as a sort of cocoon, perhaps blinkering her from her own actions. &quot;If all my fans were doing was stroking my ego constantly, and never criticising me or questioning me, I&apos;d be afraid of them.&quot; So they do criticise her? &quot;Oh, absolutely. Sometimes the most wonderful thing about having an open dialogue and very honest relationship with my fanbase is that they&apos;re as quick to criticise me, albeit much more compassionately, than the haters and the trolls.&quot; What was their critical response to &apos;a poem for dzhokhar&apos; then? &quot;&apos;Not your best poem but we know where you were coming from,&apos;&quot; she says briskly. &quot;And a bunch of your fans going &apos;too soon&apos;,&quot; Gaiman offers. &quot;Yeah, but I think the difference between my fanbase and the rest of the outside world that came thundering in is that my fanbase understood the intention and didn&apos;t misconstrue it.&quot; Gaiman seems as soft-hearted a soul as they come. I wonder how he copes with his wife being publicly attacked. &quot;I was astounded,&quot; he says gently, &quot;It was spilling over from Amanda&apos;s stuff to my stuff: &apos;Your cunt wife should have her legs cut off and a bomb shoved up her cunt for writing love poems to this terrorist.&apos;&quot;   Amanda Palmer - Have To Drive on MUZU.TV.   Last summer the Daily Mail reviewed Palmer&apos;s performance at Glastonbury by focusing on an errant nipple. She responded with Dear Daily Mail, a blithe and deliciously witty song that includes the line: &quot;Your focus on debasing women&apos;s appearances ruins our species of humans.&quot; &quot;It was one of the highlights of my life having one of Neil&apos;s aged British aunts clutch my hand and say&quot; \u2013 and she puts on an impressive English accent \u2013 &apos;I absolutely adored your Dear Daily Mail song.&apos;&quot; &quot;I suddenly saw a new phrase after that,&quot; says Gaiman. &quot;I kept seeing: &apos;Say what you will about Amanda Palmer, BUT ...&apos; \u2013 and I thought, OK, we have turned some kind of corner from the Amanda haters.&quot; She sees it a little differently. &quot;The weather will just keep constantly fucking changing, you have no control over it, and if you let yourself be too pleased with yourself that you managed to get back into the good favour of the internet ... fuck it, it&apos;s all meaningless. The hardest thing about being attacked in such a way is how deeply misunderstood you feel. To feel misunderstood hurts a lot more than feeling disliked.&quot; She looks at Gaiman. &quot;I can feel ignored, I can feel irritated, but he never misunderstands my intentions. And that&apos;s why I married him.&quot; &quot;I married her,&quot; he says, &quot;because I couldn&apos;t ever imagine getting bored of talking to her.&quot; She reaches out her arm for his hand, he reaches out for hers, and the two of them paddle palms, looking at each other. Her eyes, I realise, are flooded with tears. \u2022 An Evening With Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer is out now through 8ft records", "publicationDate": "2013-12-08T18:00:00Z", "title": "Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer: an audience with geek royalty", "sentences": ["&quot;Pretty much everybody on Earth has a threshold for how much to indulge an idiot who doesn&apos;t know how to conduct herself,&quot; Steve Albini wrote, &quot;and I think Ms Palmer has found her audience&apos;s threshold.&quot;     Palmer and Gaiman perform a free show for fans in Tel Aviv, October 2013."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/08/amanda-palmer-neil-gaiman-audience-geek-royalty"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Business"], "article": "The UK government has issued an explicit warning to British businesses over the risks of involvement in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including potential damage to a company&apos;s reputation. New guidance published by UK Trade &amp; Investment, a government body that works with British businesses in international markets, says there are &quot;clear risks related to economic and financial activities in the settlements, and we do not encourage or offer support to such activity&quot;. It goes on: &quot;Financial transactions, investments, purchases, procurements as well as other economic activities (including in services like tourism) in Israeli settlements or benefiting Israeli settlements, entail legal and economic risks stemming from the fact that the Israeli settlements, according to international law, are built on occupied land and are not recognised as a legitimate part of Israel&apos;s territory.&quot; It advises citizens and businesses to be aware of the &quot;potential reputational implications&quot; of involvement in Israeli settlements, urging those &quot;contemplating any economic or financial involvement in settlements [to] seek appropriate legal advice&quot;. It is the first time the UK government has explicitly stated its position on settlements, which are illegal under international law, in advice specifically directed at businesses. It is part of a steadily stiffening position by the UK on settlements and their produce, an indication of frustration and anger at Israeli intransigence on its activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The guidance was seized on by the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. &quot;The UK government has realised that its condemnations of illegal settlements are falling on deaf ears, and has started to address the huge amount of economic support that the illegal settlements receive from UK businesses,&quot; said Rafeef Ziadah, of the Palestinian BDS national committee.UY But, she added, the guidance needed to go further. &quot;It isn&apos;t enough to simply warn businesses about the economic and legal risks of doing business with settlements. The UK government and all EU member states have a duty to take a proactive approach to preventing businesses from contributing to Israeli violations of international law and Palestinian human rights.&quot; Pro-Palestinian campaigners pointed to firms such as G4S and Veolia, which have encountered public criticism because of their involvement in business activities across the pre-1967 Green Line. Earlier this year, the EU said it would no longer give funds or grants to bodies, including research and academic institutions, with links in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The British government has introduced voluntary guidelines for supermarkets and other retailers on the labelling of settlement produce to allow consumers to make an informed choice about purchases, and has pressed the EU to adopt a similar policy. The Israeli embassy in London said it was troubled by the assertion in the UKTI guidance that economic activity in Israeli settlements entailed special legal or economic risks, and was concerned that the warning of &quot;potential reputational implications&quot; in relation to Israel did not apply to any other country or regime. However, it welcomed the confirmation in the guidance that the British government was strongly opposed to boycotts. A spokesman for the British embassy in Tel Aviv stressed that the guidance was voluntary and decisions were the responsibility of individual businesspeople or companies. &quot;We are deeply committed to promoting the UK&apos;s trade and business ties with Israel,&quot; he added.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T18:28:44Z", "title": "UK government issues warning over doing business with Israeli settlements", "sentences": ["A spokesman for the British embassy in Tel Aviv stressed that the guidance was voluntary and decisions were the responsibility of individual businesspeople or companies."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/uk-government-warns-over-business-israeli-settlements"}, {"tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "France", "Europe", "National Theatre", "Opera", "Classical music", "Music"], "article": "The massive grey church of Saint-Sulpice dominates a part of the left bank of Paris just behind the sumptuous Od\u00e9on theatre. It&apos;s around the corner from where Patrice Ch\u00e9reau grew up in a family of artists \u2013 painters, I think he said they were. Now he lies in front of the sepulchre in his shiny black box, a muscular socialist under a mountain of Bourbon lilies. As the owlish president of the republic looks on, a young priest clouds the air with rose incense. (Later, his friends object: &quot;How absurd! Patrice was an atheist!&quot;) The grave pallbearers heave up the heavy box and lug their burden the long, long distance down the crowded nave towards the towering front door. Suddenly someone in the shadows claps. My heart stops. At once the hundreds gathered start to applaud. It echoes, swells, deepens. As the vast doors are wheeled open, there&apos;s a roar from the crowd in the square. We stand in the square in the rain, crying, greeting his friends and ours, smiling, holding hands with handsome old people we hardly know, rows of young faces glistening with tears, straight-backed, stoic, embracing each other, unable to say anything. In 2004 the great Swiss director Luc Bondy directed a show for me at the Young Vic. His close friend Patrice Ch\u00e9reau came to see it. Half-embarrassed, expecting refusal, I asked the obvious: &quot;Why don&apos;t you do one, too?&quot; Long pause. Very long pause. Charming smile. &quot;Maybe.&quot; Well, he didn&apos;t say no. For years I&apos;d followed him around Europe, wherever he had a show \u2013 theatre, opera or his own solo performances. (A notable betrayal: in Paris for one night to see him perform his version of Dostoevsky&apos;s The Grand Inquisitor, I discovered that Nina Simone \u2013 another genius \u2013 was at the Olympia. Simone won.) One summer, I cornered him outside a cafe in Aix-en-Provence just before the premiere of his incredible production of Janacek&apos;s From the House of the Dead, later seen at La Scala and the Met. He was thoughtful but evasive. &quot;Yes, I&apos;m booked up but it could happen, possibly, I&apos;m very busy, in a year or two. But we must think hard. What could the play be?&quot; A year later I was invited to Thessaloniki, where Patrice was to receive some grand European prize. That I had been asked meant something about our possible show \u2013 but what? I walked into the vast, domed civic hall on the seafront to discover I was on a panel of producers scheduled to discuss their experience of working with him. But that&apos;s ridiculous, I said. &quot;Don&apos;t make a problem. Just give your impressions.&quot; But I&apos;ve never worked with him! &quot;How can that be? He particularly asked that you should speak.&quot; Perhaps a hundred expensively dressed people looked up at the improvised stage. Sitting at one end of the group of producers, I pointed at the elderly theatre academic George Banu at the other end. &quot;You must see this as a tableau. George represents what has been, I what will be. I&apos;ve come from the future to tell you of a production Patrice has yet to do.&quot; A feeble joke, especially as I had no idea what the production would be or even, honestly, if there would be one. Someone asked the inevitable: &quot;But England has always ignored him. Tell us, why do you want so much to work with Patrice?&quot; So I told them. In 1974, Peter Hall&apos;s National Theatre invited Ch\u00e9reau&apos;s production of La Dispute by Marivaux to do a few performances in the newly opened Lyttleton. Ch\u00e9reau had been a star director in France since leaving school. In his 20s, he had joined Roger Planchon as an associate at the famous Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire outside Lyon. What are the great productions I&apos;ve seen at the NT? Planchon&apos;s Tartuffe, Peter Stein&apos;s The Hairy Ape, Giorgio Strehler&apos;s The Chioggian Quarrels, Bill Bryden&apos;s The Mysteries, Robert Lepage&apos;s Seven Streams of the River Ota, Stephen Daldry&apos;s An Inspector Calls, Katie Mitchell&apos;s Waves. It&apos;s a contradiction, but I remember all of them better than I remember La Dispute. I was 22 when I saw it. I remember a vast box hedge, a pool of water, a large woman (Congolese, was she?) singing in a deep, rich mezzo, the intensity of the exceptionally handsome actors playing the children. I remember the long, long piece of music \u2013 was it Monteverdi? \u2013 that we heard before the show began. (Was it 20 minutes long?, I asked him 35 years later. &quot;Seven and a half,&quot; was his lofty answer.) In terms of the detail of the show, I remember nothing more. But what I will never forget was the air-thrilling realisation that I was seeing something that I hadn&apos;t imagined possible. I&apos;d prepared by reading the play \u2013 but what was this? The play was there, but it was unlike any performance of any play I&apos;d ever seen (and even at that age I&apos;d seen plenty). It had an extraordinary freedom. It somehow suggested the complexity of everything, the contradictoriness. It would not be categorised. It was the truth as two people knew it \u2013 Marivaux and Ch\u00e9reau \u2013 but the total truth, for that brief moment, anyway. Who knew you could get that amount of life onto a stage? It was amazing. It was too bright, it burnt the retina, I could understand almost nothing, I can remember almost nothing. But, for me, it changed everything. Ever since then, when the lights go up in a theatre and I see a sofa or a bench plumb in the centre of the stage, I want to go home. If you&apos;ve put a sofa in the middle of the stage, where&apos;s the room for the vast box hedge? There&apos;s not enough open space for the Congolese lady to sing. A taxi drew up outside the Young Vic and Patrice stumbled out. I tried not to stare at a scab across the bridge of his nose. &quot;I am so stupid. I got drunk in my hotel room and fell onto the minibar.&quot; Uh-huh. Later I noticed one of his front teeth was loose. He took it out and waved it about, grinning. &quot;I look like a tramp.&quot; He slotted it back into his face. What will you drink, Patrice? &quot;A strong Bordeaux.&quot; He had a way of drawing all the light towards him. Dressed in costly dark colours, he seemed to burn with an intensity that needed fuel of many kinds. He often seemed about to blow up \u2013 with anger, with hilarity, with incredulity, you didn&apos;t know. His assistant director at the Young Vic, Peter Cant, described him as: &quot;Part bull, part toreador. For him directing is a blood sport.&quot; When he heard Patrice was to direct for me, a French festival director looked at me aghast: &quot;But he will explode your theatre!&quot; In a way he did. We half-hid at my corner table. &quot;I have made up my mind.&quot; Great! &quot;I want to make Macbeth.&quot; Fantastic. &quot;Yes, but there is only one actor I can make it with.&quot; We&apos;ll get him. &quot;Yes, but he is very angry with me. I know he will refuse.&quot; We&apos;ll persuade him. &quot;You think it is OK for me to make Shakespeare as my English debut? Is my English good enough? You must tell me the truth.&quot; It&apos;s a great idea. You should do it. &quot;But how to do the ghosts? When I did Hamlet at Avignon, I thought: how to make the ghost extremely frightening? I had the idea for it to gallop in on a horse.&quot; My theatre&apos;s not quite big enough for that. &quot;But I&apos;ve staged so many fights in my life, I&apos;m sick of it. But I&apos;ll do it if you say so. I trust you.&quot; Oh Jesus, please don&apos;t trust me. As predicted, the only possible actor was angry with him. So we met others, and soon Patrice had found the only actor who could possibly be better than the first. After one such casting session, he set off back to Paris. He called me from the Eurostar. &quot;You know I am doing a play by Jon Fosse?&quot; Yes, it was to be performed in a gallery of the Louvre and then all over France. &quot;His agent has sent me another one. It&apos;s crazy, they always do that. But I like this new one better than the one I agreed to. You know, it&apos;s ridiculous for me to make my English debut with Shakespeare. Read this Fosse. Say what you think, but if you like it I will make it for you.&quot; In Europe, Jon Fosse is the most performed living playwright. His subject, time after time, is &quot;the dark&quot;, the bitter and hard-won survival over despair, the self-destroying side of life we can&apos;t explain or avoid. I glanced at I Am the Wind but put off reading it for days. I eventually got to it sprawled on a pavement in the sun in Tel Aviv. Two men meet. They decide to get into a boat and row out to sea. One drowns himself. (&quot;I am the wind,&quot; he says.) The other drowns in grief. For many years, I suffered badly from depression. I know a bit about it. I know only one genius play on the subject, Endgame by Samuel Beckett. Was this another? I liked it very much but it seemed slight, the pages so empty, almost white.     Jack Laskey in Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's production of I Am the Wind at the Young Vic in 2011. Photograph: Simon Annand     Would I have said: &quot;OK, let&apos;s go&quot; to any other director? Unlikely. Who in London will want to see this play? London theatre doesn&apos;t really know Fosse, but what it knows it loathes. But that singing Congolese lady, that box hedge. &quot;Ok, let&apos;s go.&quot; I took him to see Room 7 at the Jerwood rehearsal studios, one of the best rehearsal rooms in London \u2013 high ceiling, flooded with light. On the way out, I lost him then found him contemplating a little fountain by the entrance: very low down, a rectangular block of thin stone with water gurgling around it. In Richard Peduzzi&apos;s design, this became the &quot;boat&quot; on which the two men set out to sea: a simple rectangular platform. Operated by a special metal arm cunningly manufactured in Italy, it rose up out of the big pool of water that had gushed into and filled the otherwise empty Young Vic stage. The moment when this &quot;boat&quot; first appeared was exquisite conjuring, unlike anything else I&apos;ve ever seen. There&apos;s nothing on stage except a few inches of water covering a big seaweed coloured canvas. And then - whoosh - up it came, parting the waters, and the two men were out there in middle of the ocean riding the waves. Perfect. Poetic. Existential. But also just a piece of wood steered by one man somehow sailing another over a darkened stage. Sometimes, of course, the cunning Italian metal arm malfunctioned. On press night, I stood at the side of the stage and prayed to all the gods in whom I don&apos;t believe. Long afterwards, a critic who had loved it told me that, as they took their seats, a number of his colleagues had chortled in anticipation of an evening of tedious pretentiousness. Many of them were bemused. Even bored. Even some of my friends didn&apos;t get it. Jon Fosse himself had seen a late rehearsal. He arrived early in a good state, but by the time the run began he had had a few drinks. (His agent explained: &quot;He gets so nervous.&quot;) Somehow by the end he&apos;d sobered up. He padded across the vast, still damp acre of canvas into the tromp l&apos;oeil far distant horizon and put all three of his arms round the actors (Tom Brooke, Jack Laskey) and Patrice. &apos;You have made it a love story. I adore it. It&apos;s great, it&apos;s great.&quot; It was great. I have no doubt of that. We&apos;d judged the number of performances well, and it more or less sold out. Many, many people said to me: &quot;That&apos;s the best production I&apos;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Or &quot;one of the best&quot; \u2013 let&apos;s not go crazy. Or, yes, let&apos;s go crazy. I remember the man who operated the many delicately timed subtitles when it played in Barcelona collapsing with exhaustion at the end of a performance, flat out on the floor, panting &quot;I got it right! I had to! I love it so much.&quot; I remember a performance at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville in Paris when, as the show ended, a man in the audience stood up and started shouting. Oh my God, I thought, is he booing? What&apos;s going on? It wasn&apos;t until the applause at last died down that we could hear the words he was howling across the emptying auditorium: &quot;Merci! Merci! Merci! Merci!&quot; Before he started rehearsals, Patrice told me he had prostate cancer. &quot;I have to tell you because you are my boss. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t let you down, it will be fine. I have to return to Paris every weekend for treatment. But it&apos;s OK, I can do it. Please don&apos;t tell anyone.&quot; His soul-warming smile. It was often obvious that he was in deep pain. The actors and his longtime choreographer Thierry Niang knew everything. Was he going to die? No. Was this a play about a man dying? Pause. Very long pause. Once, sitting outside the theatre, he suddenly went dead white, staggered, half-fainted, hauled himself up, recovered, sat still for a while, went back into rehearsal. I used to fetch him from St Pancras whenever he returned from Paris and the chemical onslaught. As I drove him to his hotel, he&apos;d sit in ghastly silence, clutching his translations of Conrad&apos;s Lord Jim and The Mirror of the Sea, which were part of his research. One day as he arrived on the station concourse he told me at once that the cancer had got worse. It had spread to his liver. In June this year, I emailed him and didn&apos;t hear back. In August an answer came: &quot;Hi David! I didn&apos;t answer you because my summer has been quite strange and very agitated. I am sorry. I worked very well at Electra in Aix. The production was good, I guess. Then I went to Spain and suddenly, with the heat, I discovered how exhausted I was. Now I am in hospital recovering from strong anaemia, dehydration etc. Nothing very important. The illness seems to be stopped, under control. I hope to leave this place at the end of the week and have some days of holiday finally. Lots of love, p.&quot; (Always, with Patrice, the small p.) In October I was in New York. My iPhone buzzed in my pocket. It was a text message from Katie Mitchell. &quot;I&apos;ve just heard some sad news and wanted to check you knew ...&quot; From the rainswept square of Saint-Sulpice, we took taxis to the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery. Drenched, we dawdled, stopped off for soup then got stuck in traffic. By the time we arrived the coffin had already been cemented in. A workman with a bucket was clearing his tools away. It was still raining, though lightly now. Thierry Niang looked at us, eyes full of tears: &quot;Now Patrice is the wind.&quot; I thought of all those sofas still cluttering all those London stages all those years later ... and I thought &quot;Who cares?&quot; I had the sun king in my theatre as he blazed up one last time. I wouldn&apos;t mind having that on my own tombstone. \u2022 This is a version of the speech David Lan will give on Sunday 15 December at the Young Vic at a celebration of the life and work of Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, in collaboration with the Royal Opera House and the Institut Fran\u00e7ais.

In Jerusalem, meteorologists said the worst storm to hit the city for 60 years had left snow up to 50cm deep in some areas. Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv was briefly closed on Friday morning, and major roads were littered with abandoned cars. Motorists were stranded in their vehicles for up to 12 hours as snow blocked highways. Public transport was cancelled and schools were closed for the second day. Thousands of homes were without power as snow-laden trees collapsed, bringing down power lines. Nir Barkat, the mayor of Jerusalem, described the snowstorm as a &quot;tsunami&quot;, for which the city council was unprepared. Three evacuation centres were set up to help more than 1,000 people stranded overnight. Residents of Ramallah, in the West Bank, awoke to blizzard conditions and widespread power cuts. Other areas of the West Bank, including the Palestinian cities of Hebron and Bethlehem, were struggling to cope with heavy snowfalls. Gaza, whose residents have been forced to deal with 12- to 16-hour power cuts as a result of the severe fuel shortage in the tiny coastal strip, has been affected by heavy flooding as well as the first snowfall in a decade. Dozens of people have been injured. The Israeli military opened a crossing to allow deliveries of gas for heating and other humanitarian supplies into the blockaded Gaza strip. Four water pumps were due to be delivered to help with widespread flooding. The snowstorm, which follows a November of record-high temperatures and glorious sunshine, is the second in the Holy Land within a year. Jerusalem and other areas were also blanketed in snow last January. Storm Alexa has brought blizzards, torrential rain and icy winds to the region this week. Aid agencies have warned that the weather is catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of refugees enduring the bitter cold in flimsy tents and makeshift shelters. As more snow fell overnight in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, the United Nations and other agencies scrambled to distribute warm clothing, blankets, bedding, heating equipment and waterproof plastic and tarpaulin. &quot;More snow overnight here in Bekaa valley. Another brutal night for freezing Syrian refugees in tents,&quot; Jeremy Bowen, the BBC&apos;s Middle East editor, tweeted. More refugees are reaching the Bekaa valley each day, crowding into around 250 informal temporary settlements. The Lebanese government has refused to establish refugee camps for fear that those fleeing the Syrian civil war will become permanent residents, as Palestinian refugees did in 1948. There are already around 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, joining a population of only 4.5 million. Around 2.3 million people have fled Syria since the war began. Lisa Abou Khaled, a field worker with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in the Bekaa valley told the Guardian that the snow was exacerbating already dire conditions for people living in inadequate shelters and tents. Efforts to distribute waterproof materials and blankets were being hampered by the snow, she said. &quot;These are substandard shelters \u2013 and these settlements are expanding on a daily basis. Not only are more refugees arriving from Syria, but some who have been renting accommodation in Lebanon are moving to the settlements as their money runs out,&quot; she said. &quot;Many refugees are leaving their homes with nothing but the clothes they are wearing.&quot; UNHCR said 1,300 refugees had recently arrived in a 24-hour period in a remote area of north-east Jordan called Ruwaished, after walking for days. More than half were children, the agency said.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-13T15:46:00Z", "title": "Snowstorm brings havoc and hardship across Middle East", "sentences": ["Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv was briefly closed on Friday morning, and major roads were littered with abandoned cars."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2013/dec/13/middle-east-snow-storm-alexa"}, {"tags": ["Manchester City", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Maybe when the story comes to be written about this season&apos;s Champions League that strange finish to Manchester City&apos;s game at Bayern Munich and the awkward moment when it dawned on everyone that Manuel Pellegrini had got his sums wrong will be consigned to the small print. Nobody can be certain everything would have worked out anyway and allegations of amateurishness have to be placed in the context that City have just beaten a Bayern team that accumulated every trophy going last season. They have qualified for the knockout stages for the first time and it is easy to understand why their supporters might be reluctant to feel too aggrieved if they remember it was 15 years almost to the day since Bayern were playing Manchester United and City&apos;s opposition was Mansfield Town in the Auto Windscreens Shield, in front of their lowest-ever crowd \u2013 3,007 \u2013 at Maine Road. Yet that does not change the fact that what happened in Munich was a throwback to those days at City when every silver lining came attached with its own cloud, albeit with David Silva and Jes\u00fas Navas now in midfield rather than Jamie Pollock and Ged Brannan. Most troublingly, it smacked of a lack of planning and intelligence and, though we will never know what the result might have been in different circumstances, it is tempting to wonder if there is even a flicker of embarrassment on Pellegrini&apos;s part considering a fourth goal in the Allianz Arena would have meant winning their qualifying group and a last-16 tie against Olympiakos, Galatasaray, Zenit St Petersburg, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen or a Milan side that have won only four of their first 15 fixtures in Serie A. City, as runners-up, will now get one of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain or Borussia Dortmund when the draw takes place in Nyon . Nobody will want to be paired with Pellegrini&apos;s often exhilarating side but the bottom line is that everything could have been so much more straightforward if it were not for the manager&apos;s blurred thinking, calculating his team needed to score twice more in Munich, then deciding it was probably beyond them, removing a striker for a midfielder and opting not to bring on Sergio Ag\u00fcero, the player he says is next in line to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Sir Alex Ferguson used to call these &quot;senior moments&quot; and he spoke from experience bearing in mind he once spent an infamous briefing, the day before United played Maccabi Haifa in 2002, talking about Hapoel Tel Aviv. Gordon Strachan was responsible for another one, after Celtic beat United in 2006, not realising that it was good enough to take them through the Champions League group stages until he went in for the television interviews. &quot;I think it was Gabriel [Clarke] who came up to me and said: &apos;Well done, well qualified&apos;\u2026 &apos;Pardon?&apos;&quot; Danny Higginbotham also tells a wonderful story about Southampton&apos;s first-round tie in the 2003-04 Uefa Cup against Steaua Bucharest, when they drew the first leg 1-1 before losing 1-0 to a late goal in Romania. Strachan was the manager on that occasion, too, and lost his temper afterwards asking his players why, at 0-0, they had been throwing everything forward in the second half, leaving themselves so exposed at the back. &quot;I was the first person he turned to in the dressing room,&quot; Higginbotham recalls. &quot;He said: &apos;I have to know from you all, did you not realise nil-nil would have taken us to extra-time?&apos; I had to be honest. &apos;No, I didn&apos;t think it was enough, I thought we were out on away goals.&apos; Claus Lundekvam was next and he said exactly the same. He went round everyone and everyone said the same apart from Jo Tessem. &apos;I understood, gaffer,&apos; he said. &apos;Nil-nil, extra time, I understood.&apos; Strachan went bananas at the rest of us. He walked out and we felt terrible, all thinking we had got it wrong and let him down.&quot; It was later, once everyone was showered, Strachan came back in with a sheepish look on his face. &quot;Strachan, first and foremost, is the best manager I ever worked with,&quot; Higginbotham says. &quot;He just said: &apos;Listen, something to tell you, it turns out you were right and I was wrong.&apos;&quot; That, of course, is the moment everyone in the dressing room looked at Tessem. The difference is that was Southampton&apos;s first time in Europe for 19 years whereas City are supposed to be a serious club these days, dining at the top table and well past the stage where their manager has to put up with\u00a0cheap shots about having an Alan Ball moment. Interestingly the German newspapers have been much harder on him than their English counterparts. &quot;Europas Rechenk\u00fcnstler&quot; \u2013 &quot;Europe&apos;s Maths Wizards&quot; - was the headline in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The Stuttgarter Zeitung says Pellegrini &quot;embarrassed himself&quot; and Die Welt concludes &quot;the world of football is laughing at Manchester&apos;s coach \u2026 these mistakes have a tradition at the club.&quot; Thomas M\u00fcller is widely quoted saying: &quot;I&apos;m not sure everyone knew what was at stake here.&quot; Certainly nobody in the City dugout \u2013 and it is some entourage \u2013 seemed to cotton on. Up in the press box the member of staff operating the club&apos;s Twitter account kept its followers up to speed. Down on the pitch the players were never properly briefed. &quot;We knew roughly,&quot; James Milner said. &quot;We didn&apos;t know if 4-2 would be enough or if we would need 5-2. We thought it needed to be 5-2, to be honest.&quot; My colleagues interviewing Milner report that he still seemed uncertain an hour or so after the final whistle. Looking at it optimistically, perhaps City will make it immaterial and overhaul whichever of the group winners they are drawn against. They would have to face them at some point anyway, if they actually have serious aspirations about winning the competition, and Pellegrini&apos;s insistence that he will not lose any sleep over his mistake is probably based on the fact it is strange a manager can win at Bayern and be held to account for it. Equally Dietmar Hamann is not one of football&apos;s rent-a-quote mob and it is worth listening to him when he describes it as a &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;scandalous&quot; lack of professionalism. Hamann&apos;s view is that someone from Pellegrini&apos;s backroom staff should have informed him because it is hardly the position of a player to tap the manager on the shoulder and point out he is getting it wrong. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, another man who knows a thing or two about winning European trophies, says much the same. It is not an anti-City agenda, before any of their supporters reach for the old default setting. It is just plain common sense. &quot;It mattered \u2013 because there&apos;s a big difference between winning the group and coming second in the group,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said, accurately. &quot;Just look at the list of teams on those two lists and you will see why.&quot; Hamann overlooks City&apos;s record in Europe over the past few years when he says they have cost themselves &quot;a bye to the quarter-finals,&quot; but you understand the point. &quot;Cityitis,&quot; Joe Royle used to call it, back in the day. At least Pellegrini has a team capable of sparing their blushes. Keane did not resent Clough&apos;s criticism \u2013 with Ferguson it is quite different Roy Keane did not even blink. The interviewer had just asked him to name the best manager he ever played for and Keane was straight to the point. &quot;Without a doubt Brian Clough.&quot; Not Sir Alex Ferguson? &quot;You asked the question, I answered you.&quot; And he had done so with great emphasis on those first three words: Without a doubt. He has said it a few times now and, if you were to speak to the three other players who have worked under both managers \u2013 Neil Webb, Viv Anderson and Peter Davenport \u2013 it is probably fair to say there would be a clear verdict in favour of Clough. And, indeed, that he would have demanded it. &quot;For all his horses, knighthoods and championships, he hasn&apos;t got two of what I&apos;ve got,&quot; Clough, the double European Cup winner, used to say of Ferguson. &quot;And I don&apos;t mean balls.&quot; Equally we all know Keane&apos;s motives when, in the same documentary, he refers to Ferguson as &quot;that man&quot; and breaks into a sheepish smile, almost trying to hide his face, when the interviewer points out the great coincidence that so many of the players he has chosen for his best Manchester United XI happen to be the ones who ended up falling out with the manager. Brilliant as Clough was, there is also the fact that Keane&apos;s time at Nottingham Forest, signing from Cobh Ramblers for the wonderfully unorthodox fee of \u00a347,000, actually coincided with that period \u2013 and it had never happened on the Trent before \u2013 when Clough sometimes got his plimsolls wet when he tried to walk on water. Even reaching the FA Cup final in 1991, Clough had already showed signs that he had lost a little of the old magic, never demonstrated better than when he stayed in his seat rather than speak to his players before extra time. They finished eighth the next season but the following year is when everything unravelled and one of the directors sold a story to the Sunday People that the board had started to think Clough&apos;s drinking was out of control. Keane found him sitting in complete darkness in his office one evening, pretending he was not there because Graham Taylor was outside and wanted to speak to him. &quot;The scene was comical in one way, sad in another,&quot; Keane writes in his autobiography. &quot;As I left Brian Clough cowering in his office, I reflected on the toll football could take on one of its most combative characters.&quot; The difference, strangely, is that Clough also used to pan Keane in the media but without any comeback. He punched him in the stomach after an FA Cup tie for costing the team a goal with a careless back-pass. On another occasion he told the newspapers Keane was a &quot;greedy child&quot; for wanting a pay rise. But Keane just took it. &quot;I didn&apos;t resent Brian Clough&apos;s criticism of me,&quot; he writes. &quot;I never forgot what he&apos;d done for me.&quot; With Ferguson, it is different \u2013 nastier, spiteful, as if both of them have blocked out the good times. Neither is probably finished yet either. London calling in stadium boom QPR have just announced plans for a 40,000-capacity stadium that will be more than twice the size of Loftus Road and bigger than both the current Tottenham and West Ham grounds. Spurs are planning to upgrade to a new 56,000-seat home and West Ham will be swapping Upton Park&apos;s 36,000 seats for 54,000 at the Olympic stadium the year after next. AFC Wimbledon want to move back to Plough Lane in a stadium that would start with 11,000 seats, but rising to 20,000, and Brentford, with an average attendance of 6,700, have plans of their own for somewhere three times the size of Griffin Park.

Set within the Orthodox Hasidic community of Tel Aviv, and offering an intimate insider's view of a world which remains little seen in mainstream cinema, Fill the Void is an intelligent and moving examination of the possibilities of personal freedom within the strict confines of religion and tradition. \nWhen personal tragedy strikes during the joyous celebrations of Purim, 18-year-old Shira finds her plans for the future thrown into disarray. Having long envisaged an ideal, match-made marriage comparable to that of her beloved big sister Esther, Shira discovers that she has the potential to heal her family's grief over the loss of a child if she agrees to rethink her own wedding plans. Should she pursue her long-treasured dream in which a carefully planned union with an equally inexperienced young man had always been the goal? Or should she agree to step into her sister's shoes, to occupy the gaping chasm which now looms within her family, to allow her self-abnegation to become the crucible of their future happiness? \nWritten and directed by Rama Burshtein, whose previous work is described as comprising \"films for the orthodox community, some of them for women only\", Fill the Void gives vibrant voice to characters who often seem to exist within a great silence. Like the protagonists of the Jane Austen novels which Burshtein cites as a primary influence, these women live within a society in which their options are limited by rigidly enforced rules, and yet it's their choices, emotions, conflicts and resolutions which drive and define the narrative. It is the maternal Rivka (Irit Sheleg) whose grief at the loss of a daughter provides the impetus for Shira's dilemma, and who initially conceives the plan which may offer both liberation and/or imprisonment for her family. \nThe first thing we notice about Aunt Hanna (Razia Israeli) is the defiantly strong set of her face and the directness of her gaze; it is not until we have spent some time in her company that we realise she has no arms \u2013 a factor which is entirely secondary to her strength of character. As for Shira, her youth and comparative inexperience of the outside world mask a profound and maturing sense of self, and we watch as she grows (stronger, wiser) before our very eyes, discovering the truth about her own needs and desires within circumstances which may appear to override both. A sequence in which Shira becomes lost in a melancholic fugue while playing the accordion (her name means \"song\" in Hebrew) is particularly powerful, part of a complex tapestry of interweaving lives in which music plays an integral role. \nThere is a further layer to Burshtein's creation; that of the Orthodox community's peculiarly parallel presence within the secular world. Making a point of her deliberate avoidance of any \"religious-secular dialogue\", she places her characters within the streets and houses of Tel Aviv through which they move with little or no interaction with the non-religious community. This is an alternative version of Tel Aviv as seen through the eyes of an insular community which exists within the wider parameters of the city; two worlds side-by-side but entirely separate. \nFor Burshtein, the sphere of Shira's experience is absolute; this is not a story in which retreat (or \"escape\") from the strictures of her society is an option, any more than it would be for Austen's Emma Woodhouse. Indeed, the omnipresent Hasidic ritual seems to set this story somewhat back in time, away from the modern world, closer to the conventions of the past&nbsp;than the myriad opportunities of the present. \nSome audiences may find this worldview alienating; the acceptance of an existence in which all the promises and possibilities of life are bound by the prospect of inevitable marriage brings with it many problems, both personal and political. Yet Burshtein uses the limitations of her story to her advantage, focusing on Shira's unexpected independence, stressing the value of female voices within the community, reiterating the role of choice, even within arranged unions. As for Hadas Yaron, she does a brilliant job of making Shira a fully rounded character, her face a rippling seascape of reactions and responses, at once finely nuanced yet utterly naturalistic. On the evidence of this performance (which won her a Volpi Cup award at Venice last year), Yaron is a star in the making \u2013 a talented, understated screen presence who draws and holds the camera's attention with ease and grace. \nThe myriad contradictions of Fill the Void are all captured in Yaron's expression in the final shots of the film, which offer a far more ambiguous and open-ended conclusion to this tightly controlled tale than some may care to imagine. Whatever the trajectory of the narrative, Yaron, Burshtein and Asaf Sudry have conspired to leave us with a parting glance as enigmatic and contradictory as the closing back-of-the-bus tableaux from The Graduate.

This is because her church on Piccadilly has decided to erect a full-size copy of the Israeli separation barrier to block off her Christopher Wren church. And because she lives above the shop, the grim presence of this temporary structure is with her all the time. &quot;Politics aside, living beside the 26ft wall is having a curious effect on those who are here. It dominates our imagination and has colonised our minds \u2013 and ours is only an art installation up for the 12 days of Christmas,&quot; she told\u00a0me and my 11-year-old son on a tour\u00a0of the project. It wasn&apos;t straightforward explaining the whole project to Felix. A few days after watching our church nativity play with him, it was quite an imaginative jolt to realise that Bethlehem is a real place cut off by a concrete wall and that it has very little in common with the fantasy, Narnia-like version that is the stuff of Christmas cards. I attempted to give him a potted version of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, mindful that the sort of simplifications required to explain things to a young boy in half a minute were always going to fall into one trap or another. &quot;So, whose side are you on, Dad?&quot; he then asked. &quot;Both,&quot; I replied. He was dissatisfied with that answer. And that&apos;s the problem with the Israeli separation wall: it forces you to\u00a0take sides.     Focus on modern Bethlehem at St James's, Piccadilly, where a 26ft wall has has been built to replicate Israel's separation barrier.     The online reaction to this installation has also been predictably binary. For some it is a powerful testament to Israeli government brutality; for others it&apos;s another example of Christian antisemitism seeping into the liberal church. And some of the graffiti on the Piccadilly wall reflects this same for-us-or-against-us division. Some have written about its illegality under international law; others have written that this wall saves lives. Personally, I think the separation barrier is a monstrosity that creates the feel of an open prison in places like Bethlehem and is sometimes more about a land grab by the Israeli authorities than it is about protection from Palestinian bombers. The idea, for instance, that the fence incorporates Jewish settlements such as Ariel, 12 miles into the West Bank, is evidence of its wider political role. But the line that says &quot;this wall saves lives&quot; cannot be dismissed out of hand. Last week, a friend of mine was out shopping in Jaffa when I received a text notification that a bomb had been discovered on a bus in southern Tel Aviv, not far away. In the end, it was disarmed, but one security man was hurt. The intention to create carnage on that bus was clear. And if these buses carry people you know and love, you will see things differently. During the first three years after the beginnings of the second intifada in September 2000, suicide attacks on Israeli citizens rose steeply: more than 200 people were killed in 2002. As the wall was constructed, so the numbers declined: only three people were killed by suicide bombers in 2007. It is possible to dispute the fact that there is a causal link here, but the numerical evidence is not insignificant. I know the familiar joke about the Anglican church sitting on the fence so much that it has splinters in its bum, but I admire the fact that places like St James&apos;s in Piccadilly are prepared to speak about the multiple injustices created by the wall without succumbing to some nonsense about whose side are you on. That&apos;s cheap sloganeering politics, too concerned with maintaining the purity of its own outrage. But even worse than this is the fantasy of Bethlehem as some religious Disneyland. O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie \u2013 lie being the operative word there.
