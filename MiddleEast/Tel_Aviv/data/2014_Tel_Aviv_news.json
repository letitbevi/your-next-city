Dr Zeev Rotstein, director of Tel Hashomer hospital, said Sharon&apos;s condition had deteriorated over the past two days and a number of vital organs, including his kidneys, were suffering from &quot;critical malfunction&quot;. &quot;He is in critical condition and his life is definitely in danger,&quot; Rotstein told reporters. &quot;The feeling of the doctors treating him and also that of the family with him is that there is a turn for the worse.&quot; Sharon&apos;s condition had been deteriorating for a long time, he said, but now vital organs were failing. The former prime minister is not receiving dialysis treatment, as it is not recommended for a patient with multiple organ failure, Rotstein added. Antibiotics had been administered in recent weeks for infections that caused his condition to deteriorate. &quot;He is receiving all the treatments that a patient in his condition should receive,&quot; he said. Sharon&apos;s two sons, Gilad and Omri, and other close family members were at his bedside as doctors warned he may die in hours. Raanan Gissin, Sharon&apos;s former media adviser, said: &quot;The assessment of doctors is that this is a matter of time, of days or hours, that Ariel Sharon will not be with us. This is a very sad moment for me because I was his adviser for over 15 years. And it&apos;s a very sad moment also for people in Israel because Ariel Sharon was an icon. He was like [Nelson] Mandela was for people in South Africa.&quot; Under Jewish law, burial should take place as soon as possible after death. However, Israeli officials may seek rabbinical dispensation to delay a funeral to give time for representatives of countries to travel to Israel. US secretary of state, John Kerry, is already in the region for meetings with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the progress of peace negotiations. A state ceremony is expected to mark Sharon&apos;s death, but the former prime minister is likely to be buried next to his wife&apos;s grave at the family ranch in the Negev desert.

It worked. The City&apos;s astonishingly low rents compared with other European capitals \u2013 a one-bed flat a short walk from Alexanderplatz in the centre of town can still be picked up for as little as \u20ac450-a-month (\u00a3373) \u2013 have helped draw arty people from across the world and made Berlin a major centre for artists, writers, musicians and, increasingly, technology and web entrepreneurs. The city has already produced some globally recognised tech startup successes, including the music sharing service SoundCloud and games company Wooga \u2013 and Wowereit wants more. &quot;Berlin has caught the public&apos;s attention as a startup hub,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to capture that momentum and drive Berlin&apos;s economy forward. [We] will fully dedicate ourselves to becoming Europe&apos;s leading startup hub.&quot; The city already boasts 2,500 tech startups, and has attracted hundreds of millions of euros in investment from some of the world&apos;s biggest venture capital funds. Wowereit admits that Berlin has some way to go in overtaking London as Europe&apos;s startup capital and has called in Chancellor Angela Merkel to help. She toured the city&apos;s new-tech clusters last year, told startups they were &quot;the yeast that makes the industry grow&quot; and promised to help make it easier for foreigners to register to work in the city. The momentum behind Berlin has been building steadily in the past few months with Microsoft founder Bill Gates leading a $35m (\u00a321m) investment in ResearchGate, a Berlin-based global network for scientists. Other big investments include famous Silicon Valley fund Sequoia Capital pumping $19m into 6Wunderkinder, maker of the popular to-do list app Wunderlist.As part of the investment Sequoia&apos;s Welsh partner Sir Michael Moritz will join the board of the three-year-old company that already boasts 6m users. New York fund Union Square Ventures led a $7m investment in the Football App, a mobile football news and information service downloaded by more than 12m people. Gates&apos;s successor at Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, has opened an &quot;accelerator&quot; for startups in a grand building on Unter den Linden, Berlin&apos;s most famous boulevard.It joins a long list of other big established companies, including Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Post, drugs company Bayer, media company Alex Springer and even supermarket chain Rewe and Coca-Cola. Ballmer said he chose to locate the accelerator in Berlin \u2013 alongside Bangalore, Paris, Beijing, Tel Aviv and London \u2013 because he had been impressed by the &quot;amazing emerging ecosystems&quot; and &quot;incredible startups&quot; springing up in the city. Microsoft&apos;s general manager for Germany, Christian Illek, said: &quot;Why have we chosen Berlin? Berlin is the metropolis for creativity. Berlin has become the hotspot in Europe, alongside London, for founding IT companies and startups. &quot;There is no other city like Berlin where the spirit of pioneering and innovation is so strong. If we succeed in implementing the ideas of startups into successful business models, Berlin will become Europe&apos;s Silicon Valley.&quot; Alexander Ljung, co-founder and chief executive of SoundCloud \u2013 which has attracted investment from Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher&apos;s A-Grade Fund and a rumoured $50m from venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers \u2013 said he and co-founder Eric Wahlforss chose to move from their native Sweden to Berlin because of the city&apos;s internationally-acclaimed clubbing scene and because it was much cheaper than staying in Stockholm or moving to London. &quot;The atmosphere and culture in Berlin is very unique,&quot; he said. &quot;Since the costs for living are still low, people can afford to only work a few hours per week, and do the stuff they want the rest of the time. &quot;Some folks are like professional clubgoers. And the consequence is that people in the creative, media and internet world are much more understanding and tolerant when someone comes to a meeting a little bit later, and with a hangover. Nevertheless, if you want to create a company, you have to work hard, which means that you need a lot of discipline here not to get tempted too often to enjoy the Berlin nightlife.&quot; Rising rents in London&apos;s Silicon Roundabout are also pricing out many startups, with some looking as far afield as Berlin. According to the estate agent Savills startups have made the area around Old Street roundabout so &quot;fun, funky and trendy&quot; that &quot;boring corporates think: &apos;we want a bit of that&apos;&quot; and are sending the rents up to \u00a340 per sq ft, and a single desk space in a shared office to \u00a3400 a month. By comparison, Berlin office rents can range from as low as \u20ac4 per sq ft in the trendy up-and-coming Neuk\u00f6lln district to \u20ac20 in Mitte, right in the centre. Google is backing The Factory, a new 16,000 sq ft startup campus complete with apartments, gym and restaurants built into the remains of the Berlin Wall near the touristy Mauerpark flea market. Office space in the building costs \u20ac16 per sq ft and was fully let months before opening. Simon Schaefer, founder of The Factory, said people from the UK, Europe and the rest of the world were attracted by the rents but also the opportunity to help build a community. &quot;There is nothing that Berlin really stands for, except being cheap and cool, and drunk and druggie,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s the potential to shape something, that is why so many people are coming here.&quot; Adam Haywood, the British chief executive of the photography location service Reccy, said his company chose to start in Berlin rather than London because &quot;the rents and other costs are so much lower we can stretch money a lot further. It&apos;s also a really fun city and everyone speaks English&quot;. Berlin&apos;s internationalism and the widespread use of English is another key draw for startups and investors. Jens Begemann, founder and chief executive of Wooga and a mentor to dozens of other startups, says the office language of all startups in the city is English even in the few that have all German-speaking staff. &quot;You have to have everything in English, it is the only language we speak here,&quot; he said in Wooga&apos;s colourful offices near Alexanderplatz. &quot;Because English is the official language here we can hire anyone from anywhere. There are talented young people across the world who can&apos;t get jobs; if they come here they can get a job. &quot;We have done interviews over Skype, and they&apos;ve arrived the next day.&quot; He jokes that the company canteen \u2013 which apes Google by giving away food and drink \u2013 is &quot;like the United Nations&quot; because the company employs staff from about 50 countries. Foreign staff are not required to learn English, but they are offered lessons and encouraged &quot;to try&quot;. The influx of young well-paid non-German speaking people has not gone down well with everyone, mainly because it has pushed up rents for locals. Monika Herrmann, the mayor of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, one of the areas most favoured by expats, has accused long-term visitors of treating the city as a &quot;movie set&quot;. &quot;I expect them to participate. It&apos;s not just a cool place to live. It&apos;s not just a place to party. The coolness of the district has something to do with the fact that we want to live here together,&quot; she told the English-language magazine Ex-Berliner. &quot;It has something to do with the fact that you meet in your pub at night, regardless of which language you speak. There&apos;s a danger that this will slowly disappear, because some people just want to invest in a cool area, which they don&apos;t really care about.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-01-03T18:40:55Z", "title": "Berlin's 'poor but sexy' appeal turning city into European Silicon Valley", "sentences": ["Ballmer said he chose to locate the accelerator in Berlin \u2013 alongside Bangalore, Paris, Beijing, Tel Aviv and London \u2013 because he had been impressed by the &quot;amazing emerging ecosystems&quot; and &quot;incredible startups&quot; springing up in the city."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/03/berlin-poor-sexy-silicon-valley-microsoft-google"}, {"tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "In truth, Ariel Sharon&apos;s journey ended long ago. Eight years have passed, almost to the day, since he was silenced by a stroke that left him lodged in the limbo between life and death. That state of ambiguity was strangely fitting for a figure who, after decades painted as either black or white \u2013 reviled by his enemies as the &quot;butcher of Beirut&quot;, loved by his admirers as &quot;Arik, King of Israel&quot; \u2013 ended his life an unexpected shade of grey. After a long career as his country&apos;s most fearless, some would say brutal, warrior \u2013 his father&apos;s gift to him on his fifth birthday was a dagger \u2013 and as patron to the settler movement, Sharon&apos;s final act was to dismantle some of the very settlements he had sponsored. In 2005 he ordered Israel&apos;s disengagement from Gaza, seized in the 1967 war in which Sharon had been a crucial, if maverick, commander. When the stroke struck, he was poised to win an election that would, it was widely assumed, be followed by further withdrawals from the West Bank. The former general had unique credibility to do that \u2013 to fix borders that had remained provisional since the state was born \u2013 because he was drawn from Israel&apos;s founding generation. Sharon had fought in the 1948 conflict Israelis call their war of independence: despite having his arm in a plaster cast, he led a platoon. Even his name was given to him by Israel&apos;s founding father, David Ben-Gurion \u2013 turning the young Scheinerman into Sharon as if he were King Arthur anointing a knight. Israel&apos;s current president, the apparently immortal nonagenarian Shimon Peres, was also a Ben-Gurion protege and key player in 1948, but he was never a soldier. The demise of Sharon means the 1948 combat generation has gone. And that matters more than you might think. The explanation can be found in a new, immensely powerful book. My Promised Land by the Haaretz columnist Ari Shavit is a personal history of Israel, one that begins in 1897 with a boatload of dreamers yearning for Zion, sailing to Jaffa: their leader is a British Jew, the Rt Hon Herbert Bentwich \u2013 the author&apos;s great-grandfather. From there, Shavit offers us places and moments that between them tell the story of the last remarkable century, whether absorbing successive waves of Jewish refugees from the rubble of post-war Europe or building the secret nuclear reactor at Dimona, from the triumphs of the settlers to the failures of the peace movement. The book is not without flaws. Critics have faulted the scarcity of women, Mizrachim (Jews of Middle Eastern origin) and Palestinians in Shavit&apos;s narrative. There is no denying that his vantage point is that of Tel Aviv&apos;s male, liberal elite. He is an Israeli aristocrat, his link to Bentwich putting him on a par with those Americans who trace their origins to the Mayflower. By his own admission he is a Wasp, a White Ashkenazi Supporter of Peace. But that does not negate the book&apos;s three great strengths. The first is context. Every time an interviewee is introduced \u2013 whether a great novelist or the unnamed engineer behind Israel&apos;s nukes \u2013 we are given their back story, the life that led to their views. You can still disagree with the most hawkish speakers, but it&apos;s useful to know the harrowing past of loss and violent bereavement \u2013 often but not only in the Holocaust \u2013 that shaped so many of them, the fear that transformed itself into a desperate longing to survive. Similarly, Shavit resists the binary simplicities that afflict so much discussion of Israel-Palestine. His book will provide ammunition both to those who despise Israel and those who revere it, telling of its darkest deeds as well as its shining triumphs. Propagandists for both sides, who resemble each other so closely, could cherry-pick favourite facts to buttress their view \u2013 but both will end up disappointed. Shavit is a hawk on the Iranian nuclear threat, for example, but fierce in his denunciation of the post-1967 occupation. He slams Israel&apos;s hawkish supporters for failing to address the occupation and slams Israel&apos;s opponents for failing to address Israelis&apos; deep fear of their own annihilation. To truly understand the country and the conflict, he says, you have to understand both: that &quot;occupation and intimidation&quot; are the twin pillars of the Israeli condition. But Shavit goes further. He castigates his former comrades in the peace movement for focusing so narrowly on the territories conquered in 1967, as if returning them to the Palestinians will solve the entire conflict and bring blissful resolution. For, he insists, the heart of the matter is not 1967 but the birth of Israel in 1948. In one chapter, he meticulously reconstructs events in the mainly Arab town of Lydda in July 1948, when soldiers of the embryonic Israeli army emptied the place of its Palestinian inhabitants and, according to Shavit, killed more than 300 civilians. In an unflinching account based on the testimony of those who did the killing, Shavit states baldly: &quot;Zionism carrie[d] out a massacre.&quot; Now, Shavit is not the first Israeli to stare the reality of 1948 in the face. He quotes a famously candid speech from 1956 in which Moshe Dayan did much the same. More than 30 years later, Israel&apos;s &quot;new historians&quot; excavated the archives, looking for the factual truth. Some of those described themselves as anti-Zionists, others as post-Zionists. But Shavit might be the first such voice from deep inside the Zionist mainstream to speak so directly of the events the Palestinians regard as the nakba, the catastrophe. That represents a profound challenge to Israel and its supporters. Shavit is telling them, as an Israeli patriot profoundly committed to his country, that it can avoid this painful history no longer: it has to own up to it. His message to the Israeli left \u2013 and perhaps to John Kerry, now on yet another peacemaking trip to Jerusalem \u2013 is that it can delude itself no more that dealing with the relatively easy matter of the post-1967 occupation will be enough to bring peace. Ending the occupation is a worthy goal in its own right, Shavit says, but the real Palestinian grievance originates in 1948. That thought fills the author with pessimism. He sees &quot;no solution&quot; to the clash of Palestinians who believe their land was stolen and Israelis who believe their collective lives depended on taking it. I think Shavit is right about the necessity for honesty, but wrong to believe this means a true peace is forever doomed. Much of what Palestinians demand is precisely the acknowledgement that in 1948 they did indeed suffer a nakba. If Israel could one day make such an admission, who knows what accommodation might follow? The tragedy for both sides is that the right people to speak that truth were the founding generation. Those who fought the war of 1948 were best placed to close its wounds. An intriguing habit of Sharon&apos;s was to refer to places in Israel by their original, Arabic names \u2013 thereby acknowledging the truth that usually lies buried beneath the soil. Leading his nation to do the same could have been Ariel Sharon&apos;s final mission. They will have to do it without him.

Tuto, not his real name, is an athlete from the Nuba region of Sudan. He trains in 400m, 800m and 1500m distances and has won medals in professional international competitions. But this is not what he wants to stop. For the past six years Tuto, his wife and two young children have lived a life on the run, fleeing violence in Sudan to seek a better life in Israel. Yet after settling in the town of Arad, life for the Tutos remained a struggle. &quot;I stayed in Israel for five years and six months and I worked as a cleaner in hotels,&quot; Tuto said. &quot;Life in Israel is very hard for refugees. I worked from 6am to 5pm and then I trained [as an athlete]. My children also faced racism at school. In Israel you are like a machine. You work from day to night and you face racism from the highest ranked [person] to the lowest,&quot; he added. The Tutos were among an estimated 60,000 migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, in Israel \u2013 a community that the government has declared unwelcome. Last year the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was determined to remove &quot;tens of thousands of infiltrators&quot;, saying new measures were necessary to &quot;protect the Jewish and democratic character of the state&quot;.  Under the international convention on refugees, of which Israel is a signatory, the government is unable to forcibly repatriate anyone if there is ongoing violence in their home country \u2013 so it is seeking other ways to reduce migrant numbers.  One of these is a controversial new law that allows migrants without visas to be detained indefinitely in an open-prison that required them to sign in three times a day. Protests against this law, which was introduced three weeks ago, have seen tens of thousands of migrants taking to the streets of Tel Aviv yesterday and today, and a strike that has caused disruption to businesses such as restaurants, hotels and cleaning services, where migrants are often employed.     One of the asylum seekers protesting in Israel today. Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA    The government is also offering financial incentives to refugees in an attempt to get them to return home voluntarily. For the Tuto family this looked like an attractive option so, rather than face detention, they accepted a $1,500 payment to return to Sudan via Egypt.  But when the family arrived they faced further persecution from the Sudanese government, which strictly forbids its citizens from travelling to Israel. At the airport, Tuto told officials that the family had been in Egypt rather than Israel, but the deception was easily detected by Sudanese authorities as Tuto&apos;s children, aged seven and five, had lived most of their lives in Israel and speak Hebrew rather than Arabic. Three days later Sudan&apos;s National Intelligence and Security Service visited Tuto&apos;s home in Khartoum. He was out at the time and the officials took his mother into custody for days, questioning her about her son&apos;s whereabouts. Fearing for his life, Tuto and his family went into hiding. &quot;In Sudan, security forces were after me every day. They wanted to put me in jail,&quot; Tuto said. &quot;There is no security in my country, I couldn&apos;t live there.&quot; &quot;I moved from safe house to safe house. I was terrified every day and I moved between more than 10 houses, staying with friends and family. They would beat and intimidate my mother and my siblings. I&apos;d rather die than stay in Sudan,&quot; he added. So once again the family was forced to flee, arriving in a country he would prefer not to identify, where again they are unwelcome. They live in a rented house with a one month permit to remain, and the little money they have is slowly running out. &quot;My children don&apos;t go to school. We don&apos;t leave the house. We don&apos;t know anyone. We don&apos;t know anything.&quot; he said. &quot;I regret leaving Israel. At least there I could work. I feel tricked by the Israeli government.&quot;     Tel Aviv residents protesting against the African migrants in their neighbourhood in 2012.  Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    Amnesty International, which has documented the stories of migrants in Israel, has criticised the way they are treated. Yonatan Gher, the director of Amnesty International Israel, said: &quot;Asylum seekers in Israel... do not get access to fair and transparent asylum proceedings, have no work permits and no access to basic health and welfare services.&quot; He said the new detention law added to the pressures on refugees, who, like Tuto, were being driven to accept so-called voluntary return forms, only to put their lives in danger. Both the Israeli and Sudan government have denied responsibility for the Tuto family&apos;s fate. An Israeli government spokesman described the family&apos;s experiences in Israel as &quot;marginal incidents&quot; that were not representative of the country&apos;s &quot;multicultural, multi-religious, and multi-lingual&quot; cultural diversity. Dr Khalid Al Mubarak, a spokesman for the Sudanese government, rejected suggestions that the security services intimidated returnees. &quot;Some people go to Israel, some are recruited and trained (to fight the Sudanese government), and then they are sent back to the Sudan. Of course our security service would need to screen people (returning),&quot; he said, &quot;but any tales of going to the family and beating them up, that is nonsense.&quot; For Tuto, the only option left is to keep running. He is currently trying to train with a local running group. &quot;I still have $900 left (of the Israeli money),&quot; he said. &quot;Our only hope is to be resettled to another country. I don&apos;t have any other hope. I can&apos;t work and I have no money.&quot; Additional reporting by Patrick Galey.

The speaker of the Knesset, Israel&apos;s parliament, refused to allow entry to a delegation to attend a meeting with politicians from leftwing parties. The protesters had been barred &quot;against the backdrop of the tension and general public atmosphere, as well as the fear that granting the infiltrators access will cause provocations in the parliament&quot;, the speaker&apos;s office said. Eli Yishai, the former interior minister, urged the government &quot;to put every single one of the infiltrators in detention facilities, take their work permits, put them on aeroplanes and send them packing to their countries or a third country&quot;. Outside parliament, the acclaimed Israeli author David Grossman told protesters: &quot;The idea of Israel contains the idea of refugees, of people who escaped from a terrible destiny to find refuge and shelter.&quot; He said he felt &quot;embarrassed and ashamed that we have reached this situation. Israel has not created this problem but there is a problem now, and we have to struggle with it and to solve it in the most humane way. You are not criminals: you are normal, ordinary people who are trapped in an abnormal and very extreme situation.&quot; Tens of thousands of refugees, mostly from Eritrea and Sudan, have been on strike since Sunday, affecting hotels, restaurants and other services in which they are employed, usually without work permits in lowly paid, menial jobs. About 20,000 took part in a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Sunday and up to 15,000 protested outside the US and European embassies and the offices of the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, in the city on Monday. More than 100 detained refugees are on hunger strike. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly said &quot;infiltrators&quot; from Africa threaten the Jewish character of Israel. &quot;These are not refugees \u2026 they are illegal immigrants who have come looking for work,&quot; he said at the weekend. There are an estimated 53,600 refugees or migrants from Africa in Israel, nearly all of whom entered via Egypt, according to government figures. The flow has been almost completely halted by the construction of a steel fence along Israel&apos;s border with Egypt last year. According to interior ministry figures, none of 1,800 asylum requests from Eritreans and Sudanese have been approved; an estimated 70% of asylum applications from Eritreans and Sudanese are approved by European governments. Last month, the Israeli government passed a law allowing for &quot;infiltrators&quot; to be compulsorily detained for up to a year. A new &quot;open&quot; centre in the desert has capacity to hold up to 9,000 migrants indefinitely. All are being encouraged to voluntarily return to their countries of origin. &quot;We have fled persecution, forced military conscription, dictatorship, civil wars and genocide. Instead of being treated as refugees by the government of Israel, we are treated as criminals,&quot; an organisation called Freedom4Refugees said in a statement. &quot;A range of unprecedented policy changes has caused us to take drastic measures to display our discontent, frustration and fear \u2026 We have asked the Israeli government to improve [its] asylum policies, recognise us as refugees and give us our rights accordingly. Instead, with every year that passes, we have been criminalised, met with xenophobia and increasingly dehumanising policies.&quot; Critics of the government&apos;s policy say Israel has sought to attract hundreds of thousands of foreign workers, mainly from south-east Asia, in recent years to take low-paid jobs such as care workers and agricultural labourers. Migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa could be offered such jobs instead, they say. Some also suggest Israel should be especially welcoming to refugees, given the history of persecution of the Jews.

Since 2006 Sharon had lain in a vegetative state in a private room at a long-term care centre near Tel Aviv, tended round the clock by dedicated nursing staff and watched over by two plain-clothes agents from the Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s internal security agency. He never regained consciousness, although doctors and family members insisted he showed a limited response to stimuli. He was dependent on fluids and nutrients delivered through a feeding tube, although he breathed without the assistance of the artificial respirator stationed in his room. The delicate question of how long the former prime minister should be kept alive without hope of recovery was rarely discussed openly. According to his son Gilad, medical staff urged the family to allow him to die in the aftermath of the stroke, declaring &quot;the game was over&quot;. The family rejected the advice. &quot;I would never be able to forgive myself if we did not fight to the end,&quot; Gilad Sharon wrote in a biography of his father published in 2011. The cost of Sharon&apos;s medical care was recently estimated at $456,000 (\u00a3277,000) a year. The bill was paid entirely by the state until 2011, when a parliamentary committee decided it should be shared between the government and the Sharon family. The stroke that in effect ended Sharon&apos;s life was blamed largely on his voracious appetite. Throughout his political career \u2013 but with increasing urgency as the prime minister grew older and bigger \u2013 Sharon&apos;s medical advisers repeatedly warned him of the dangers of obesity. They cautioned him to curb his legendary consumption of food and cigars, and to take regular exercise. The injunctions were heard and ignored. A typical meal with friends and family would include hamburgers, steak, lamb chops, shish kebab and an array of Middle Eastern salads, followed by chocolate cake, according to the Israeli media. An adviser said he had &quot;been told he needs to go on a diet since 1965&quot;. He was a regular customer of a rundown restaurant in Beit Jala, a Palestinian Christian village next to Bethlehem, trapped behind the imposing concrete wall that Sharon built, where the mouthwatering smell of barbecued chicken permeates the neighbourhood. According to the owner, Nakhle Qaabar, Sharon&apos;s unmistakable form materialised twice in the restaurant itself, but mostly he would dispatch a government driver to fetch a super-sized takeaway. The lifestyle took its toll. On 18 December 2005, the prime minister was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke. He was examined and treated, and discharged after two days with surgery to repair a small hole in his heart scheduled for early January. On 4 January 2006, the night before that appointment, Sharon suffered another stroke at his beloved ranch in the Negev desert. A paramedic urged that he be taken immediately to the nearest hospital, in the city of Be&apos;er Sheva. But Sharon&apos;s personal doctor, Shlomo Segev, who had been consulted over the phone by Sharon&apos;s son Gilad, countermanded this with an instruction to keep him at the ranch until Segev could get there from Tel Aviv. Half an hour later, Sharon collapsed in the bathroom. An ambulance was summoned to take him to hospital in Be&apos;er Sheva, but its departure was delayed when security personnel could not manoeuvre the stretcher carrying the prime minister into the vehicle. As it was finally about to leave, Segev arrived and redirected the ambulance to the world-class Hadassah hospital on the edge of Jerusalem, 55 miles (90km) away. En route, the doctor rejected the offer of a helicopter transfer. By the time Sharon arrived at the Hadassah, his condition had seriously worsened. He was operated on for seven hours, the first of several marathon surgical procedures, but never regained consciousness. After four months at the Hadassah, the former prime minister \u2013 whose successor, Ehud Olmert, had by this time won a general election \u2013 was moved to the Sheba Medical Centre where he remained until his death. According to those close to the former prime minister his health fluctuated, although he never emerged from his coma. He breathed independently, according to Dov Weissglas, a former close aide to Sharon. &quot;He is breathing spontaneously, not on a respirator,&quot; he told the Guardian six years ago. &quot;If you disconnect him from the feeding machine, it means he would die slowly out of hunger and thirst \u2013 no one on earth will do it. He is very much alive, in terms of somebody who is in a coma.&quot; Gilad, his wife, Inbal, and his brother, Omri, took turns to visit Sharon every day, insisting that they saw signs of response when they read aloud or played music in his hospital room. According to friends, the brothers were convinced their father might make a miraculous recovery. &quot;His children and the doctors who are treating him see different signs that he is aware, that he knows what is going on,&quot; Reuven Adler, a family friend, told the Guardian in 2007. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to tell if he listens, if he sees. They tell me: &apos;We saw an improvement today,&apos; or: &apos;He reacted fantastically today.&apos; The two sons are very serious guys. They are not imagining these things.&quot; Four years later, Gilad was still optimistic. &quot;When he is awake, he looks at me and moves fingers when I ask him to,&quot; he told the New York Times in 2011. &quot;He lies in bed, looking like the lord of the manor, sleeping tranquilly. Large, strong, self-assured. His cheeks are a healthy shade of red. When he&apos;s awake, he looks out with a penetrating stare. He hasn&apos;t lost a single pound; on the contrary, he&apos;s gained some.&quot; A year ago, medical experts said Sharon had exhibited &quot;robust activity&quot; in his brain during tests. Scans showed the former prime minister responding to pictures of his family and recordings of his son&apos;s voice. However, doctors said the chances of him regaining consciousness were almost zero. Sharon&apos;s kidneys began to fail last month, and a decision was taken not to put him on dialysis. Other vital organs subsequently showed signs of failure. Although his doctors spoke in recent days of his strong heart and his fighting spirit, they knew it was only a matter of time. The former soldier and political leader is expected to be laid to rest at the ranch in the Negev desert that he loved dearly. On a hill, under a willow tree, lies the grave of his second wife, Lily, who died in 2000. The following year, an interview with the Guardian, he said, with tears in his eyes: &quot;One day, I will be buried here too, next to my wife.&quot; Eight years after he last uttered a word, his wish is about to be realised.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-11T12:50:40Z", "title": "Death finally claims soldier-politician Ariel Sharon after eight years in coma", "sentences": ["Since 2006 Sharon had lain in a vegetative state in a private room at a long-term care centre near Tel Aviv, tended round the clock by dedicated nursing staff and watched over by two plain-clothes agents from the Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s internal security agency.", "But Sharon&apos;s personal doctor, Shlomo Segev, who had been consulted over the phone by Sharon&apos;s son Gilad, countermanded this with an instruction to keep him at the ranch until Segev could get there from Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/ariel-sharon-dies-eight-year-coma-israel"}, {"tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "Few global figures were as compelling as Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli prime minister who has died aged 85. A remarkable blend of maverick and mainstay, he fought in all of Israel&apos;s main wars and gave the impression of\u00a0having been involved in every political development since the nation&apos;s birth in 1948. He was left in a persistent vegetative state by a massive stroke in January 2006. As a military officer and general, Sharon had courted international controversy by his battlefield belligerence. Historians blamed him for instigating unnecessary wars; foes accused him of targeting civilians. A\u00a0considerable number wanted him tried as a war criminal for allegedly abetting atrocities against Palestinians in Beirut in 1982. His supposed passage from warmonger to peacemaker was the stuff of countless editorials. Sharon was more than a piece of living history, however. He was also a supremely canny politician who knew the pulse of Israeli civil society better than any other. First elected premier in 2001 and re-elected in 2003, in November 2005 he did the unthinkable for a ruler: he resigned from his own party. Breaking free from the Likud \u2013 the coalition he had helped cobble together in 1973 \u2013 he created a brand new party from scratch, Kadima (&quot;forward&quot; in Hebrew). For most politicians, this would have been tantamount to suicide. Still in the glow of his aura, and now under his disciple, Ehud Olmert, Kadima swept aside Labour and Likud in the March 2006 elections. Long before then, Kadima&apos;s creator had established a reputation for building up and then destroying. In August 2005 he audaciously dismantled all Jewish settlements in Gaza, in the teeth of fierce protests. Sharon personally planned these colonies \u2013 and many more in the occupied West Bank \u2013 in the mid-1970s; hence the feeling on the right that he had betrayed the Greater Land of Israel cause. &quot;Withdrawal&quot; was clearly, then, more than an empty gesture. In the words of several Palestinians who had written internet messages shortly after his stroke in 2006, he had been the first Israeli leader to acknowledge in practical terms their right to owning part of the &quot;Holy Land&quot;. His own ultimate peace plans remained a secret. But the Hamas victory in Palestinian elections only three weeks after his stroke and the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon shifted the balance yet again. Sharon became prime minister in his twilight years on a pledge to stifle the Palestinian rebellion that began in September 2000. On 6 February 2001 he defeated the Labour incumbent, Ehud Barak, by almost 25 percentage points in Israel&apos;s last direct prime ministerial elections. On 28 January 2003 he cemented his power by leading the Likud to a historic electoral victory over its Labour rivals. Both as general and statesman, Sharon acted like a bulldozer. Critics held him responsible for miring Israel in Lebanon from 1982 to 2000, when some 1,200 Israeli soldiers and 17,000 Lebanese died. Many also blamed him for sabotaging the 1993 Oslo peace process. On 28 September 2000 he visited Jerusalem&apos;s Temple Mount with a &quot;message of peace&quot; and 1,000 armed police. If it was a calculated move, it paid off. His presence prompted a full-blown Palestinian uprising, and allowed him to gain national leadership four months later by posing as Israel&apos;s saviour. To his supporters he was always &quot;Arik, Melech Yisrael&quot; (King of Israel), the only politician who told it like it was. Sharon had proved his bravery during the 1948 war of independence, and reached public attention five years later, when the prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, chose the 24-year-old officer to head a new elite commando squad called Unit 101. Their brief was to eradicate cross-border raids by Palestinian fedayeen (guerrillas), yet many felt the overzealous Sharon was becoming a law unto himself. He regarded civilians who &quot;harboured terrorists&quot; as legitimate targets. On 14 October 1953, his commandos attacked Qibya in Jordan and killed 69 residents, including women and children. After Qibya, concluded Egypt, peace with Israel would be impossible. Many historians feel the raid contributed to the Suez crisis three years later. It was during this latter conflict that Colonel Sharon captured the strategic Mitla Pass and thus played a key role in capturing the Sinai peninsula for Israel. After the war, though, Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt, and Sharon faced criticism for disobeying orders and recklessly endangering soldiers&apos; lives at Mitla.

Photograph: Terrence Spencer/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Image    In the June 1967 six-day war, Major-General Sharon retook both the pass and Abu Agheila. In 1970-71, he crushed dissent in occupied Gaza by relocating 160,000 refugees, killing 100 Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) suspects, and arresting another 700. Witnesses recall him drawing a grid for his patrols and then bulldozing every house on it. In October 1973, he claimed he had turned the tide of the Yom Kippur war by crossing the Suez canal, trapping the Egyptian 3rd army and winning the largest tank battle since Kursk in 1943. Ever mindful of his image, he was photographed with a bloodstained bandage swathing his rakish quiff. Sharon entered the Knesset in 1973 and became minister of defence in 1981. As soon as he was in office, he started planning to alter the regional map. Ostensibly, he aimed to eliminate threatening PLO units in southern Lebanon. In fact, he planned to install a puppet Maronite regime in Beirut and expel Lebanon&apos;s 300,000 Palestinians. He calculated that they would flee to Jordan, overthrow King Hussein and build a new Palestine on the ruins of the Hashemite kingdom. Israel would then hem in its most dangerous foe, Syria. So went the theory. In practice, Sharon&apos;s masterstroke began to go awry soon after he launched Operation Peace for Galilee on 6 June 1982. It was rumoured that he and the chief of staff, Rafael Eitan, misled the prime minister, Menachem Begin, who envisaged a limited 48-hour operation (Begin resigned a year later). Sharon did dislodge the PLO, but at the cost of creating hundreds of thousands of refugees, risking war with Syria and bombing Beirut virtually unremittingly. For the first time, Israeli conscripts balked at fighting what Begin called a &quot;war of choice&quot;. Matters worsened with the assassination of Sharon&apos;s ally, the Lebanese president-elect Bachir Gemayel, on 14 September 1982. For the next three days, Phalangist Christians took revenge, under Israeli eyes, by killing between 800 and 2,000 Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. Some 400,000 Israelis marched in protest, and an Israeli commission of inquiry held Sharon personally, albeit indirectly, responsible. After much resistance, he resigned in February 1983 and was forbidden from holding the defence post again. In Lebanon, his excesses spawned a new enemy among the formerly friendly Shias of the south \u2013 Hezbollah. Over the ensuing 18 years of Israel&apos;s occupation of part of Lebanon, these fundamentalists proved more hostile than the PLO had ever been.     Ariel Sharon, centre, with Moshe Dayan, left, on the western side of the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur war, 1973. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Colleagues had detected signs of megalomania in Sharon long before these events. He would yell obscenities at fellow officers and disobey orders in order to conduct reckless battlefield operations. Despite that, he was an educated man and a witty raconteur. He revelled in classical music, and cherished friends ranging from Israeli leftists such as Shimon Peres to African dictators such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Sharon had studied Middle East history at Jerusalem&apos;s Hebrew University in 1952, military strategy at Camberley Staff College, Surrey, in 1957, and graduated in law from Tel Aviv University in 1966. He was born at Kfar Malal, 15 miles north-east of Tel Aviv, a moshav (collective settlement) in central Palestine. His parents, Samuel and Vera Scheinerman, had arrived six years earlier from Russia. Ariel was barely a year old when Bedouin marauders threatened their home. No doubt such family memories coloured his views, although later Arab negotiators found him neither racist nor disrespectful. He also never forgave moshav-dwellers who ostracised his parents for running a\u00a0private plot. As a teenager he fought for Labour&apos;s Haganah militia. In early adulthood, he remained within the ambit of Mapai, Labour&apos;s chief constituent party. But when he entered politics, he gravitated towards the right. In December 1973 he became a Knesset member for the capitalist Liberal party, befitting a man who was Israel&apos;s largest cattle rancher. He helped create the Likud bloc by joining his Liberals and other smaller factions to Begin&apos;s Herut as senior partner. Bored with the niceties of opposition politics, in 1975 he became security adviser to the Labour prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, though in 1977 he contested elections as head of his own Shlomtzion (Peace of Zion) party. Sharon was now a leading advocate for militant settlers. Although never a religious Jew \u2013 his passion for gargantuan plates of non-kosher food was legendary \u2013 he saw the settlers as Israel&apos;s new pioneers. Between 1978 and 1981, back in the Likud, he used his powers as agriculture minister to establish 240 settlements in the West Bank and Galilee. These &quot;facts on the ground&quot;, he hoped, would render any future territorial compromise impossible. Land was Sharon&apos;s leitmotif. But in government, realpolitik prevailed. He agreed to return Sinai to Egypt, and in April 1982 he dismantled Israeli towns there, to the chagrin of his supporters. Many of these settlers decamped to new locales in Gaza, at Sharon&apos;s instigation, only to be removed once more, 23 years later. He survived Lebanon to become industry minister in the Likud-Labour coalition governments of 1984-90, but failed to topple the Likud leader and prime minister from 1986, Yitzhak Shamir, in internal party elections.     Ariel Sharon, minister of industry and trade, in a session of Israel's parliament in 1985.    From 1990 to 1992, Sharon (now housing minister) mischievously founded a new settlement whenever the US secretary of state James Baker visited Israel. This led an angry US administration to cancel a $10bn loan guarantee. Sharon ran up debts of $600m on grandiose immigrant housing schemes in remote locations. Wary at the mounting cost of his beliefs, voters threw out Likud in 1992 and elected Labour. Likud skipped a generation by choosing Binyamin Netanyahu, and not Sharon, as Shamir&apos;s successor. In opposition, he rejected the Oslo peace agreement as &quot;a moral error of the first order&quot;. He had mused about meeting Yasser Arafat in the 1970s; now he called the PLO chairman a &quot;war criminal&quot;. Envious of Netanyahu&apos;s appeal, Sharon considered opposing him in the first direct election for prime minister in May 1996. By standing down, he avoided splitting the rightist vote and thus allowed Netanyahu to narrowly beat the prime minister Peres. Netanyahu initially excluded Sharon from his cabinet, but then grudgingly created a portfolio for him, the ministry of national infrastructure. Characteristically, Sharon exploited the office&apos;s ambiguities to become tsar of water, electricity, housing and roads. Then, in October 1998, as the newly appointed foreign minister, he astounded his acolytes by signing the Wye River agreement, facilitated in Maryland by President Bill Clinton, which granted Palestinians control over another 13% of the West Bank. In May 1999, when Netanyahu lost national elections to Labour&apos;s Barak, Sharon was virtually the only big player left in the Likud. He assumed the party leadership and became head of the opposition. He rebuilt the shattered party, thwarted Netanyahu&apos;s attempted comeback in late 2000, and lambasted Barak&apos;s concessions to Arafat at Camp David in July 2000. Then, in elections in February the following year \u2013 at the age of 72 \u2013 he garnered 62.5% of the vote and overwhelmed Barak.     Ariel Sharon, right, shakes hands with the Palestinian prime minister Mahmoud Abbas, watched by the US president George W Bush following a summit meeting at the Royal Palace in Aqaba, 2003.  Photograph: Hussein Malla/AFP/Getty Images    As prime minister, Sharon hoped to inspire the esprit de corps of his army years. A throwback to the early Zionists, he was wedded to the soil, certain of his beliefs, the antithesis of the supposedly pitiable diaspora Jew. The public knew him as the hero of his autobiography, Warrior (1989). Now he rejected an understanding reached between Clinton and some Israeli and Palestinian ministers. This pact to end violence and address the most pressing issues (Jerusalem, settlers, statehood and borders) was unofficially agreed at Taba in Egyptian Sinai, during late December 2000 and early January 2001. By then the Al Aqsa intifada had been raging for three months and showed few signs of abating. Israeli voters \u2013 including Labourites disillusioned by what they saw as Palestinian mendacity and belligerency \u2013 felt drawn to the old warrior. Elected on a landslide in prime ministerial polls in February 2001, Sharon set about creating a government of national unity with a defeated Labour. Two considerations influenced this decision: a desire not to repeat the error of ignoring national fissures, as in 1982; and a sense that a Labour cabinet presence would insulate him from international criticism. He especially welcomed Peres, reappointed Labour leader after Barak&apos;s resignation. The veteran Labourite&apos;s expertise and links with Arab and western leaders was a prized asset; he became foreign minister and deputy prime minister. True to form, Sharon intensified retaliation against Palestinians, including &quot;targeted assassinations&quot;. He once described Israeli retaliations as &quot;a continuation of our war of independence&quot;. Simultaneously he hosted visiting US diplomats, first the CIA director George Tenet and then Senator George Mitchell. Yet he demanded &quot;10 days of quiet&quot; before talks with Palestinians could start. Palestinian militants continued suicide attacks on Israeli citizens. As long as established Palestinian leaders could not or would not stop such actions, Sharon could claim Israel had &quot;no peace partner&quot;. By the same token \u2013 some Israeli journalists said \u2013 Sharon had undercut moderates by surrendering the trump card to extremists. Israel&apos;s new ruler refused to meet Arafat, whom he charged with duplicity and connivance in murder. Next, he exploited US fury after 9/11 and convinced President George W Bush that Israel&apos;s fight against Hamas and Fatah militants was part of the new &quot;global war against terror&quot;. Bloody suicide bombings in early 2002 prompted him to reoccupy Palestinian cities. Israeli troops sealed Arafat in his compound in Ramallah, but while it was impossible for the PLO chief to leave, it became increasingly perilous for Sharon to leave Israel too. At one stage it appeared that a Belgian court would charge him with war crimes. He faced troubles at home as well. Wariness at the lack of a grand strategy eroded support, while poorer sectors balked at the austerity policies of finance minister Netanyahu. Israel&apos;s economy was ailing: poverty was increasing and a single mothers&apos; movement gathered pace. It seemed that Sharon had momentarily lost touch with his core constituents. In August 2002, Labour left the government in protest at secret budgetary contributions to settlements. Bereft of coalition partners, on 6\u00a0November Sharon called for early parliamentary elections. Although three weeks later he won the Likud leadership election, it seemed he risked defeat at the polls. Not only was he haunted by a scandal over alleged bribes and unethical payments dating back to 1999, but voting irregularities in choosing the Likud electoral list added to his problems. Labour&apos;s new leader, retired general Amram Mitzna, accused Sharon of acting like a mafia boss. The tide turned in his favour after new terror attacks (including one against Israeli tourists in Mombasa) and voters&apos; wariness about Mitzna&apos;s daring peace plans. On 28 January 2003, Likud doubled its seats to 40, Labour fell to 19, and Sharon began planning a new administration. Mitzna, meanwhile, refused to join the new coalition. Likud chose instead to ally itself to smaller parties. There were chasms over core beliefs (on peace, synagogue and state, and economic policy). Rightwing and religious parties sat uncomfortably with the moderate, secularist Shinui. On 30 April the US released its &quot;road map to peace&quot;. Despite his 14 objections, Sharon accepted it and committed Israel to withdraw from West Bank cities and release more Palestinian prisoners. A fortnight later, he held talks in Jerusalem for the first time with the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas. Yet despair returned as June saw yet more terror attacks and Israeli reprisals, with Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire. Some air force pilots refused to fly if innocents were endangered. There was desultory criticism from America, but Israel&apos;s principal ally was otherwise engaged in Iraq. Arafat spoilt the US grand plan by denying Abbas meaningful powers, leading to his resignation on 6\u00a0September; and an unofficial Palestinian truce began to crumble. Sharon chose to press ahead with two unilateral measures. One was the accelerated construction of a &quot;security fence&quot; or &quot;separation wall&quot;, ostensibly to stave off suicide bombers. In July he rebuffed Bush&apos;s request that he freeze the barrier construction. The second venture was to prove much more controversial. After months of tinkering with dismantling illegal hilltop settlements, while expanding better established ones, Sharon shocked the world on 2 February 2004, by saying Israel would pull troops out of Gaza and evacuate all 22 settlements in the strip. Angry settlers galvanised half of Likud&apos;s Knesset members to deride the scheme as the end of Eretz Yisrael. On 2\u00a0May it was Sharon&apos;s turn for a shock when party members rejected his Gaza plan by a 2-1 margin. Had his political nous failed him? Leftist critics had questioned his sincerity over leaving Gaza. Yet they had to reconsider when he sacked ministers to force his cabinet to accept the plan. In July, tens of thousands of settlers formed a 50-mile human chain to condemn the plan. Bizarrely, a large peace rally around that time hailed Sharon as a convert to compromise. Some militant settlers and their rabbinical mentors hinted that he deserved death for &quot;treachery&quot;, just like his predecessor, Rabin. Evidently rightwingers were not assuaged by his decision to assassinate successive Hamas leaders, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Rantissi. Later that year, foreign ministry staff worried that Israel was becoming an international pariah. So had the old warrior truly turned into an elder statesman? Or did he plan to use Gaza withdrawal as a ruse to cantonise Palestinians in a Jewish-dominated West Bank? Arafat&apos;s death that November was a chance to test the theories. Publicly, Sharon acknowledged the possibility of gaining a &quot;partner for peace&quot;. His four-decade involvement with Arafat had so dominated Israeli-Palestinian relations that until one or other, or both, players vacated the stage, said critics, there could be no peace. Sharon cautiously welcomed Abbas&apos;s selection as PLO chairman, and promised that Palestinian presidential elections would proceed. Scarcely had this &quot;opportunity&quot; arisen than a budgetary quarrel smashed Sharon&apos;s minority coalition government. Peres (returned as Labour leader) again threw Sharon a lifeline; the pair negotiated a new coalition to promulgate Gaza withdrawal. Meanwhile, Abbas convincingly won the presidential polls on 9 January 2005, and met Sharon at a much-publicised summit on 8 February. Together they declared a truce in the four-year intifada, after which Sharon vowed to release another 500 Palestinian prisoners. Sharon prevailed upon his cabinet to back Gaza withdrawal. The pullout began on 1 August, and the last settler left seven days later \u2013 ahead of schedule, notwithstanding much-publicised protests. The Israeli flag was lowered in Gaza a month later. Ultimately, Sharon ceded control of Gaza&apos;s southern Rafah border post to Egypt, another notable departure from Israel&apos;s traditionally cautious strategy. In the final analysis, Sharon calculated accurately: most Israelis then supported withdrawal as a necessary palliative on what was seen then as the road to peace; and settlers, once touted as &quot;national pioneers&quot;, appeared out of touch. Less successful was the hoped-for joint strategy between Abbas and Sharon. Their meeting in June 2005 ended in failure, and post-pullout meetings were cancelled after terror attacks. In what was seen as a landmark address to the United Nations, on 15 September 2005, Sharon called for peace and overtly recognised Palestinian rights, while reasserting Israel&apos;s claims over a united Jerusalem and its determination to fight terror. It took the surprise victory of Amir Peretz over Peres in the Labour party, in November, to provide the catalyst for change. Within hours Peretz ordered Labour ministers to desert the coalition; three days later Sharon dropped his own bombshell, announcing the creation of what was to become Kadima. He cited frustration at backstabbing by Likud central committee members and parliamentary rebels. He had urgent reforms in mind, but could not enact any, he claimed. Immediately 13 Likud Knesset members joined him in exile. Some rebel Labourites followed suit, and even Peres pledged support. Opinion polls correctly suggested that Kadima would trounce Likud and Labour. Once more, Sharon, the creator of worlds, had become the destroyer and daring rebuilder, but this time he would not see the consequences. What Kadima stood for was not clear. Some say Sharon was about to launch a New Deal to meet the challenges that Peretz was posing on behalf of the neglected poor; others felt his security toughness would provide cover for daring new peace plans. Nor did the election of his nemesis, Netanyahu, as head of what remained of Likud much trouble the old soldier. It seemed that the appeal of Sharon, around whom the party coalesced, was sufficient to command trust in Kadima. Hence when he suffered a first, minor, stroke, in December 2005, a few began to realise the danger of placing their faith in his personality-driven enterprise. A second stroke, a few weeks later, cast all of Israeli politics into doubt. It fell to Sharon&apos;s ally, Olmert, to assume the role of acting prime minister. Olmert led Kadima to a less convincing election victory on 28 March; and was confirmed as prime minister on 14 April, the day Sharon was declared &quot;permanently incapacitated&quot;, having been in a coma for 100 days. Most outsiders will remember Sharon as a military dynamo and hardline Zionist. Yet in private he was said to be a contemplative man, who only felt true peace on his 1,000-acre farm in the arid Negev, and hid a tragic private life. His beloved first wife, Margalit, died in a car crash in 1962; her sister, Lilly, his formidable second wife, succumbed to cancer in 1999; in 1968, his favourite son, Gur, was killed in a shooting accident.

The former army general and prime minister suffered multiple organ failure over the new year. His sons were at his bedside at the Sheba Medical Centre, a long-term care facility near Tel Aviv, where Sharon has lain since May 2006.     Shimon Peres (left) with Ariel Sharon in Egypt in 1975.

But Sharon&apos;s death, at the age of 85 and after eight years in a coma, was less of a shock to Israel than the devastating stroke that felled him on 4 January 2006 at the height of his premiership.

Photograph: Hussein Malla/AFP/Getty Images    Even so, for many Israelis he will be mourned as a giant figure who played a key role in shaping Israel both as a soldier and a statesman. His passing severs the last link to the iconic generation which fought in the 1948 war that followed the declaration of the state. His reputation as a fearless \u2013 and controversial - soldier was matched by his uncompromising ideology as a politician. Among Palestinians and leftwing Israelis, he will be remembered as a powerful and reviled champion of Israel&apos;s colonial settlement project, and the political force behind the construction of the vast concrete and steel separation barrier that snakes through the West Bank. Many will not forgive him for failing to prevent the killing by Lebanese Christian forces of hundreds of Palestinians and Lebanese Shia in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982.

The former prime minister is expected to be buried at his ranch in the Negev desert, next to his wife&apos;s grave. Using Sharon&apos;s nickname, the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, paid tribute to the former prime minister. &quot;My dear friend, Arik Sharon, lost his final battle today. Arik was a brave soldier and a daring leader who loved his nation and his nation loved him. He was one of Israel&apos;s great protectors and most important architects, who knew no fear and certainly never feared vision. He knew how to take difficult decisions and implement them. We all loved him and he will be greatly missed.&quot; Danny Ayalon, former deputy foreign minister, said Sharon was a giant, both militarily and politically. &quot;He could be very tough on the battlefield but very reasonable in the political sphere. That&apos;s what made him very special.&quot; Barack Obama said: &quot;On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the family of former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon and to the people of Israel on the loss of a leader who dedicated his life to the state of Israel.&quot; David Cameron said: &quot;Ariel Sharon is one of the most significant figures in Israeli history and as prime minister he took brave and controversial decisions in pursuit of peace, before he was so tragically incapacitated. Israel has today lost an important leader.&quot; Ed Miliband said: &quot;Nobody can doubt the impact he had on Middle East politics.&quot;  Sharon suffered a first stroke on 18 December 2005 at the age of 77. The prime minister had long indulged his gargantuan appetite for rich food and cigars, despite doctors&apos; repeated warnings that he needed to lose weight and take exercise. The prime minister was kept in hospital for 48 hours. Seventeen days later Sharon had another, much bigger, stroke at his Negev ranch. Despite paramedics urging his immediate transfer to the nearest major hospital, one of Sharon&apos;s personal doctors insisted the prime minister should be kept at home until the physician could personally examine him. However, following a further collapse while waiting for the doctor&apos;s arrival, an ambulance was called. Instead of being taken to the nearest hospital, the doctor directed the ambulance staff to drive to the Hadassah hospital on the outskirts of Jerusalem, a journey of around an hour. Sharon underwent several long operations but never recovered consciousness. Four months after the stroke he was transferred to a long-term medical facility near Tel Aviv, where he remained \u2013 apart from one brief home visit in 2010 to assess whether he could be moved to his Negev ranch \u2013 until his death on Saturday. There was a glimmer of hope last January when doctors said the former prime minister had exhibited &quot;robust activity&quot; in his brain during tests. Scans showed Sharon responding to pictures of his family and recordings of his son&apos;s voice. However, medical experts said the chances of him regaining consciousness were almost zero. Sharon \u2013 known as &quot;Arik&quot; to his friends, &quot;the Bulldozer&quot; to his critics \u2013 was a giant figure, both literally and metaphorically, in Israel. He was accused of war crimes after between 800 and 2,000 Palestinians were butchered at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982 in Lebanon by Phalangist Christians while Israeli forces stood by. Sharon was defence minister at the time. But his reputation as a belligerent and uncompromising rightwinger was challenged in the period immediately preceding his stroke by his astonishing decision to withdraw Israeli forces and settlers from the Gaza Strip, and his determination to carry out the evacuation in the face of virulent opposition and accusations of betrayal. Analysts were divided over whether the man who had been a driving force of the settlement enterprise then intended to initiate a much more complex withdrawal of settlers from the West Bank, or whether he had &quot;sacrificed&quot; Gaza in order to maintain Israel&apos;s hold on the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Following his incapacitation, Ehud Olmert assumed the role of prime minister. Kadima, the party Sharon founded after breaking with the rightwing Likud shortly before his demise, won the largest number of seats, with Olmert at its helm, in the general election of March 2006. Kadima, on the centre-right of the Israeli political spectrum, was predicted to reshape the electoral landscape. But the party has floundered in the vagaries of Israeli politics, with its multitude of parties and unstable proportional representation electoral system. In last January&apos;s election, the party won only two seats. Olmert was seen as technocratic leader in contrast to the colourful, ideological, strongman image that Sharon enjoyed. In a foreword to Sharon&apos;s autobiography, Warrior, the late Israeli journalist Uri Dan wrote: &quot;Though much of the world knows him by the title of this autobiography, he is fundamentally a man of peace.&quot; Many assessments of Sharon&apos;s life and legacy will dispute that.

The scene was a typical English cafe as a bald John Bull type in a white polo shirt looked up towards the television news and instinctively sprayed out a mouthful of whatever he was drinking. It never showed what he actually saw but his face was a picture of shock. Then the words flashed on the screen alongside him. &quot;It&apos;s a bloody big deal.&quot; Financially, yes. Jermain Defoe will be paid \u00a390,000 a week over the four years of his contract and plainly that has been enough to make him think, a few months after turning 31, it is worthwhile joining a club whose name appears to be synonymous with failure. An article in the Globe and Mail, by the football correspondent and author John Doyle, should tell you everything you need to know about Defoe&apos;s new employers. &quot;There&apos;s something soul-destroying about TFC&apos;s sad, seven-year history,&quot; Doyle wrote last May. &quot;The FC stands for &apos;futility club&apos;. Coaches and executives come and go. Players come and go. But TFC stays stalled. And maybe the only way to categorise it is this way: as a new team, an expansion team about to be born, as it was when founded in May 2006, a year-zero team. It&apos;s always year zero in Toronto.&quot; Until a year ago, Paul Mariner was coaching the team, culminating in fans protesting at matches by wearing paper bags over their heads. Mo Johnston, another name from the Panini sticker books, has had spells as manager and director of soccer, was nicknamed Trader Mo and is another one who can be ticked off when Doyle goes through the strange cast of people &quot;who, frankly, seem to know nothing about building a soccer club&quot;. Aron Winter, the former Holland international, was the manager before Mariner and now it is the turn of Ryan Nelsen, lured away from the chaos of QPR&apos;s relegation season, as a friend of the president (who has since been removed) and with absolutely no background in coaching. Jason de Vos, a former Canada international, has called it &quot;without a doubt, the most bizarre coaching appointment ever made in Major League Soccer&quot;. As for the results, well, the mayor Rob Ford is not the only person in Toronto clinging on to his job. Nelsen&apos;s team won six of their 34 games in the season that finished in October, lost 17, drew 11 and finished second from bottom of the Eastern Conference, getting nowhere near the play-offs \u2013 pretty much in line with what it has been like in every year of their existence. In 2012 it was even worse, finishing 19th out of 19 Major League Soccer (MLS) teams. The previous year they were 16th out of 18 but with the worst defence in the competition. Nelsen tried to steady the team by bringing in a succession of players whom many people might have suspected were no longer in the sport. Robert Earnshaw, 32, was a free agent after leaving Maccabi Tel Aviv. Bobby Convey, once of Reading, followed, aged 30. Steven Caldwell, 33, came in from Birmingham City and has just been named the supporters&apos; player of the year. &quot;The team could be called Ryan Nelsen&apos;s retirement home for mediocrities,&quot; according to Doyle. &quot;There is no identity to TFC, no iconic player, no team ethos to promote, no populist coach to present. There is nothing. Zilch. Zero year, every year.&quot; Nelsen, the eighth coach to have a go at putting it right, has talked about trying to eradicate &quot;seven years of mistakes&quot;. Doyle describes results as &quot;disastrous&quot;. Defoe, to put it bluntly, is joining a club where the limitations are limitless. A club with plenty of cash and a showy front but nothing behind it, like a Kinder chocolate egg with no toy inside \u2013 the equivalent in standard, you could say, of a side in the bottom six of the Championship, if you were putting it generously. Perhaps he is excited by the possibility of being the star man and the satisfaction that might follow if he can help deliver the first sliver of success. Then again it did not really work out that way for Toronto when they made the former Germany international Torsten Frings one of their &quot;DPs&quot; \u2013 designated players \u2013 or the Dutchman Danny Koevermans. No, this is about the bags of gold on offer and another reminder that money is how a lot of footballers keep the score these days \u2013 enough of it evidently that Defoe is willing, if necessary, to surrender part of his career and sacrifice going to the World Cup, given that he is effectively asking Roy Hodgson to select someone who has now broken free from top-level club football. Hodgson will not be schlepping over to Canada to watch him at the open-air BMO Field, where the attendances fell last season to a new low of just over 18,000. He has always been an admirer of Defoe, the way he brilliantly comes to life inside the penalty area, and the speed of thought and finishing that has established him in fifth place on the all-time list of Tottenham scorers. Yet who can blame the England manager for sounding unenthusiastic now the player&apos;s priorities have become so blurred? &quot;We will have to see what the competition for places is and what other possibilities I have,&quot; Hodgson said when the proposed transfer was mentioned before Christmas. &quot;It won&apos;t be quite as simple as saying: &apos;While you are in America you have got no chance.&apos; But on the other hand I am not prepared to go down the other route and say: &apos;If you go and play your football in America you are still guaranteed a place on the plane.&apos;&quot; Hodgson had previously recommended that, if Frank Lampard were leaving Chelsea, as had looked likely last season, and had ambitions to figure in the World Cup, it would not be a good idea for him to choose Los Angeles Galaxy as a resting stop. Those comments attracted enough publicity at the time for Defoe to understand very well the risks, in a sporting sense, about dropping down to this level. The MLS, as Sir Alex Ferguson notes in his latest autobiography, is too athletic to be derided as a Mickey Mouse league. Yet he still points out there were absolutely no football reasons for David Beckham making the move and that he suspects his old player probably regrets taking himself away from high-end football. As for Toronto \u2013 or &quot;Ambitious Toronto&quot;, as the English press appear to have renamed them \u2013 they may have some money swilling around but their story is so undistinguished to this point it brings to mind an old quote from Rodney Marsh about the West Bromwich Albion side relegated in 2003. &quot;They&apos;ve made some new signings but it&apos;s like putting lipstick on a pig. It&apos;s still a pig.&quot; Defoe was apparently persuaded that Canada was the best place for him, rather than another club in England or trying to win over a new manager at Spurs, when he took a telephone call from Drake, the rapper and Toronto fan. The striker follows a path once trodden by Danny Dichio, Carl Robinson, Rohan Ricketts, Richard Eckersley and Ronnie O&apos;Brien, once on the books of Juventus (zero appearances) and briefly one of the most famous Irish people in the world because of a students&apos; campaign to vote him in as Time magazine&apos;s Person of the Century. The money is sensational but it would have to be because this is the moment, unfortunately, when we should probably stop taking Defoe&apos;s career seriously. David Moyes must ignore the ex-factor The funny thing is that Sir Alex Ferguson, at one point last summer, had confided he was extremely aware his presence in the stands might increase the pressure on David Moyes. Ferguson, at a meeting of Manchester United&apos;s supporters&apos; club secretaries, acknowledged it might be a difficult balancing act, bearing in mind his new position as a director, and said he would have to consider how it might impinge on his successor. Evidently he has concluded there is not a great deal he can do if the television cameras decide to zoom in whenever United are doing badly and, in the case of their defeat at Sunderland, capture him shaking his head and wearing the expression of someone who has just missed the last bus home. It was always going to be slightly awkward for Moyes, like going on a date while the other person&apos;s ex tags along, but I would also wager it is a long way down the list of things the manager would like to change. He would never admit it, but Moyes is probably entitled to think Ferguson&apos;s treatment of Wayne Rooney, going against everything he has ever preached to publicise a private conversation and announce the striker had asked for a transfer, was a classic piece of selfishness that badly undermined the club throughout his first months in the job. The timing of Ferguson&apos;s autobiography, with all its strategic point-scoring, is another demonstration of his less appealing side and, yes, it is probably true Moyes would not have looked quite so inadequate if the retired manager were not so visible. It would be a much greater problem, however, if Ferguson had been turning up unannounced at the training ground or if the players were going straight to him, rather than Moyes, something that happened regularly to Wilf McGuinness and Frank O&apos;Farrell when Sir Matt Busby stopped managing the team without being able to cut himself free. So far, there has been no evidence of that, and it seems to be more of an issue for the media than the relevant people at Old Trafford. If nothing else, Moyes really should be focused on the players around him rather than the guy 20 yards or so over his left shoulder. Fanning the flames of moneyball Last week, I asked whether the Football Association might try to do more to take care of its own competition. The answer promptly came in the form of the television schedules for the FA Cup&apos;s fourth-round ties and the news that Liverpool&apos;s supporters will potentially be asked to trek down to Bournemouth for a 12.45pm kick-off. Arsenal&apos;s tie against Coventry City has been switched for BT&apos;s coverage to a Friday night, in a move the Sky Blue Trust has aptly described as &quot;money first, money second, money third and, oh yeah, there&apos;s the supporters&quot;. It has been that way too long and, sadly, nothing changes.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-11T22:00:00Z", "title": "Jermain Defoe heading for a dead end moving from Tottenham to Toronto | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Robert Earnshaw, 32, was a free agent after leaving Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/11/jermain-defoe-tottenham-toronto-world-cup"}, {"tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "Israel", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The death at 85 of Ariel Sharon, Israel&apos;s former prime minister who had been in a deep coma since suffering a stroke in January 2006, represents an extraordinary moment of rupture in his country&apos;s history. Of the generation of Israeli soldiers and politicians who fought in Israel&apos;s founding conflicts, only Shimon Peres now remains in a prominent role. Sharon&apos;s life represented a metaphor for Israel&apos;s trajectory. The son of Russian immigrants and born in a farming community near Tel Aviv in 1928, he was a teenage volunteer in the fight against British rule in the Palestine Mandate. He was present at many of the key symbolic moments in Israel&apos;s development. He fought \u2013 and was wounded \u2013 in the 1948 war of independence that Palestinians know as the Nakba \u2013 the &quot;catastrophe&quot;. A bloody ruthlessness was also evident from early on when he led the infamous 1953 retaliation raid on Qibiya in Jordan that saw 69 Jordanians, many of them civilians, killed. All would be overshadowed, however, by his role as a key architect of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the personal responsibility a commission of inquiry ruled that he had for one of the worst human rights violations of that conflict \u2013 the Sabra and Shatila massacre in which many hundreds of Palestinian refugees were murdered by Lebanese Christian militiamen. And it was Sharon who presided over another landmark moment \u2013 the dismantling, in the face of angry opposition, of Jewish settlements in Gaza. In reality, the rupture with the past took place a long time ago in January 2006 when Sharon slipped into the coma from which he would never awake. Within a handful of weeks, Palestinian politics would also be transformed with the landslide victory in Gaza of Hamas over the Fatah movement of his old adversary Yasser Arafat. Israel \u2013 and its place in the world \u2013 has also changed in those intervening years. Since the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, Sharon&apos;s country has prosecuted two conflicts \u2013 against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza \u2013 that largely failed in their military objectives. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign \u2013 while controversial \u2013 has continued to gain traction, while the election of Palestine to the UN General Assembly as a non-member observer in 2012, against Israeli and US objections, has been another key moment. Both in domestic politics and on the wider social front, Israel has been forced to confront uncomfortable truths about tensions both within Israeli society and with the wider diaspora long overshadowed by the averred contingencies of national security. As the Israeli journalist and author Ari Shavit argues in his new book My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, his country has become a less certain place in the last decade, returning to questions Sharon&apos;s generation believed had been answered long ago: &quot;Why Israel? What is Israel? Will Israel?&quot; In some respects, those such as Shavit, who began in the left Zionist movement Peace Now, have moved closer to Sharon&apos;s late political vision when he ordered the evacuation of the Gaza settlements, believing that, without a peace deal imminent at any time in the near future, Israel must act unilaterally to end the occupation of the West Bank as a moral necessity. In other ways, however, evidence of Sharon and his policies is still sharply in evidence, not least in the separation barrier that he gave approval to. Perhaps the most significant change is the one that is least visible, a subtle alteration in the balance of power within both Israeli and Palestinian society that has seen the emergence of a newly confident economic class that is demanding a more normalised political state. On the Israeli side, that has been driven not only by its technology sector but by the discovery of its new offshore gas fields whose most likely customers are Palestinians and its other Arab neighbours. In the final analysis, how will history judge Ariel Sharon&apos;s importance? That task is probably best left to an Israeli commentator, Amir Oren, writing in Haaretz immediately after his death. &quot;He is a person who experienced pleasure and pain, who lost a son and was widowed twice, who used people and organisations (the IDF, Likud, the Shlomtzion and Kadima parties, the settlement enterprise in the West Bank and Gaza) as a private launching pad for himself; who achieved maximum power but wasted it on petty matters.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-01-12T00:06:00Z", "title": "Ariel Sharon: a life that shaped Israel's story and mirrored its turbulent times | Observer editorial", "sentences": ["The son of Russian immigrants and born in a farming community near Tel Aviv in 1928, he was a teenage volunteer in the fight against British rule in the Palestine Mandate."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/12/observer-editorial-legacy-of-ariel-sharon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Philippines", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "The X Factor", "Culture", "Television", "Television & radio", "Entertainment"], "article": "Israel&apos;s invisible force of Filipino carers of elderly people and those who are infirm was a little more visible on Wednesday after 47-year-old Rose Fostanes won Israeli X Factor, stunning judges and the public with her rendition of My Way.

I can&apos;t believe this has happened to me.&quot; Comparisons have been made with Susan Boyle, the 52-year-old Scot who won fame for her performances in Britain&apos;s Got Talent in 2009.

Three decades on, the criminally overlooked music he made in that bedroom has been released as a record called Hearsay I-Land, and it&apos;s a fine reissue. &quot;There was a lot of cross-pollination of sounds happening,&quot; he says, recalling a decade filled with some of the greatest electronic music the city has ever played host to. &quot;And that&apos;s what I&apos;d really been about anyway, mixing various sounds together and coming up with another kind of sound in itself.&quot;            Reading on mobile? Click here to listen to Ballo-Balla Before moving to New York in 1980, Young lived in San Francisco, where he hosted a show on the FM radio station KSAN on which he&apos;d try out these new sounds. On his website, he describes this endeavour in typically expansive terms: &quot;Africa, Asia, Europe and native America became the source material, space and silence became the structure, and composing, improvising and the continued development of instrumental facility became the tasks.&quot; Young&apos;s passions ran to the charmingly arcane. He nurtured a particular interest, for example, in the correlation between the tonalities of pygmy singing and those of 1960s and 70s avant garde jazz. But Young was also a club kid, an enthusiastic dancer who took his own records along on nights out to try to persuade DJs to play them. He wouldn&apos;t likely see a division between these two sensibilities \u2013 the tirelessly experimental on the one hand, and the beat-happy, groove-seeking on the other \u2013 but when he brought the entirety of 1984&apos;s I-Land record to parts of 1987&apos;s Hearsay Evidence, it seems like the world wasn&apos;t quite ready for it. &quot;People didn&apos;t quite know what to think,&quot; he says, &quot;because it wasn&apos;t new wave, it wasn&apos;t disco, it wasn&apos;t ska. And it had a sparseness about it that I don&apos;t think they&apos;d quite heard at that time.&quot; And did anyone give him a hard time for making music that wasn&apos;t jazz? &quot;Yeah, some of the avant garde purists did,&quot; he says. &quot;They hated my Isophonic Boogie Woogie: they didn&apos;t like the cover, they didn&apos;t like my use of electronics, they didn&apos;t like anything.&quot; But he was pissing off the right people? &quot;Exactly,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;I kind of felt like if certain people didn&apos;t like what you were doing then you were on the right track.&quot; He adds: &quot;There&apos;s that saying, &apos;no man is an island&apos;, but I always felt like a complete island unto myself. So that was really what that name I-Land was all about.&quot; In other words, Young never really expected anyone else to care \u2013 particularly not decades later. But, in 2007, a Brooklyn DJ called Jacob Gorchov came across a copy of 1987&apos;s Hearsay Evidence in a bargain bin at a record store. He bought it on a whim and was so excited by what he heard that he tracked down Young. &quot;It&apos;s quite amazing that [Hearsay Evidence] connected with another generation,&quot; Young says. &quot;That&apos;s the way it is, you know?

Click here to listen to Don&apos;t Ever Take Your Love Away He and Gorchov took the best of Hearsay Evidence and the best of I-Land, and the result is Hearsay I-Land, which Gorchov put out on his own label, Palto Flats. So far, the reaction has delighted Young. &quot;People who like my other music also like this, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m most happy about \u2013 that it&apos;s not a compartmentalised thing, you know? They can accept it as part of a whole being. If it is insanity on my part,&quot; he says happily, &quot;then at least I have some brothers and sisters who are with me.&quot; The songs are sleazy and innocent, often at the same time. Don&apos;t Ever Take Your Love Away is a dub-inflected ballad on which Young&apos;s high, lean voice is particularly melancholy, but the oddest and sweetest track is the stealth-groove of Ballo Balla. Featuring vocals from his wife, Risa, it sounds very young, almost adolescent, particularly on the push-pull, spoken chorus of Ballo-Balla. There&apos;s a sincerity and simplicity to it that can&apos;t only be explained by the basic production. &quot;It&apos;s about dancing,&quot; he says. &quot;We met at an after-hours club on the dance floor. So dance is a very integral part of our relationship. She was dancing by herself and I was watching her, and she just pushed the guys all off and looked at me and shrugged her shoulders, and I got the message. So we fell in love.

It is the stuff of pulp thrillers and the sort of narrative often used to characterise the worst fears about the Iranian nuclear programme. In reality, though, neither US nor British intelligence believe Tehran has decided to build a bomb, and Iran&apos;s atomic projects are under constant international monitoring. The exotic tale of the bomb hidden in the desert is a true story, though. It&apos;s just one that applies to another country. In an extraordinary feat of subterfuge, Israel managed to assemble an entire underground nuclear arsenal \u2013 now estimated at 80 warheads, on a par with India and Pakistan \u2013 and even tested a bomb nearly half a century ago, with a minimum of international outcry or even much public awareness of what it was doing. Despite the fact that the Israel&apos;s nuclear programme has been an open secret since a disgruntled technician, Mordechai Vanunu, blew the whistle on it in 1986, the official Israeli position is still never to confirm or deny its existence. When the former speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, broke the taboo last month, declaring Israeli possession of both nuclear and chemical weapons and describing the official non-disclosure policy as &quot;outdated and childish&quot; a rightwing group formally called for a police investigation for treason. Meanwhile, western governments have played along with the policy of &quot;opacity&quot; by avoiding all mention of the issue. In 2009, when a veteran Washington reporter, Helen Thomas, asked Barack Obama in the first month of his presidency if he knew of any country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, he dodged the trapdoor by saying only that he did not wish to &quot;speculate&quot;. UK governments have generally followed suit. Asked in the House of Lords in November about Israeli nuclear weapons, Baroness Warsi answered tangentially. &quot;Israel has not declared a nuclear weapons programme. We have regular discussions with the government of Israel on a range of nuclear-related issues,&quot; the minister said. &quot;The government of Israel is in no doubt as to our views. We encourage Israel to become a state party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT].&quot; But through the cracks in this stone wall, more and more details continue to emerge of how Israel built its nuclear weapons from smuggled parts and pilfered technology. The tale serves as a historical counterpoint to today&apos;s drawn-out struggle over Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. The parallels are not exact \u2013 Israel, unlike Iran, never signed up to the 1968 NPT so could not violate it. But it almost certainly broke a treaty banning nuclear tests, as well as countless national and international laws restricting the traffic in nuclear materials and technology. The list of nations that secretly sold Israel the material and expertise to make nuclear warheads, or who turned a blind eye to its theft, include today&apos;s staunchest campaigners against proliferation: the US, France, Germany, Britain and even Norway.     Whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu.  Photograph: AP    Meanwhile, Israeli agents charged with buying fissile material and state-of-the-art technology found their way into some of the most sensitive industrial establishments in the world. This daring and remarkably successful spy ring, known as Lakam, the Hebrew acronym for the innocuous-sounding Science Liaison Bureau, included such colourful figures as Arnon Milchan, a billionaire Hollywood producer behind such hits as Pretty Woman, LA Confidential and 12 Years a Slave, who finally admitted his role last month. &quot;Do you know what it&apos;s like to be a twentysomething-year-old kid [and] his country lets him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting,&quot; he said in an Israeli documentary. Milchan&apos;s life story is colourful, and unlikely enough to be the subject of one of the blockbusters he bankrolls. In the documentary, Robert de Niro recalls discussing Milchan&apos;s role in the illicit purchase of nuclear-warhead triggers. &quot;At some point I was asking something about that, being friends, but not in an accusatory way. I just wanted to know,&quot; De Niro says. &quot;And he said: yeah I did that. Israel&apos;s my country.&quot; Milchan was not shy about using Hollywood connections to help his shadowy second career. At one point, he admits in the documentary, he used the lure of a visit to actor Richard Dreyfuss&apos;s home to get a top US nuclear scientist, Arthur Biehl, to join the board of one of his companies. According to Milchan&apos;s biography, by Israeli journalists Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman, he was recruited in 1965 by Israel&apos;s current president, Shimon Peres, who he met in a Tel Aviv nightclub (called Mandy&apos;s, named after the hostess and owner&apos;s wife Mandy Rice-Davies, freshly notorious for her role in the Profumo sex scandal). Milchan, who then ran the family fertiliser company, never looked back, playing a central role in Israel&apos;s clandestine acquisition programme. He was responsible for securing vital uranium-enrichment technology, photographing centrifuge blueprints that a German executive had been bribed into temporarily &quot;mislaying&quot; in his kitchen. The same blueprints, belonging to the European uranium enrichment consortium, Urenco, were stolen a second time by a Pakistani employee, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who used them to found his country&apos;s enrichment programme and to set up a global nuclear smuggling business, selling the design to Libya, North Korea and Iran. For that reason, Israel&apos;s centrifuges are near-identical to Iran&apos;s, a convergence that allowed Israeli to try out a computer worm, codenamed Stuxnet, on its own centrifuges before unleashing it on Iran in 2010. Arguably, Lakam&apos;s exploits were even more daring than Khan&apos;s. In 1968, it organised the disappearance of an entire freighter full of uranium ore in the middle of the Mediterranean. In what became known as the Plumbat affair, the Israelis used a web of front companies to buy a consignment of uranium oxide, known as yellowcake, in Antwerp. The yellowcake was concealed in drums labelled &quot;plumbat&quot;, a lead derivative, and loaded onto a freighter leased by a phony Liberian company. The sale was camouflaged as a transaction between German and Italian companies with help from German officials, reportedly in return for an Israeli offer to help the Germans with centrifuge technology. When the ship, the Scheersberg A, docked in Rotterdam, the entire crew was dismissed on the pretext that the vessel had been sold and an Israeli crew took their place. The ship sailed into the Mediterranean where, under Israeli naval guard, the cargo was transferred to another vessel. US and British documents declassified last year also revealed a previously unknown Israeli purchase of about 100 tons of yellowcake from Argentina in 1963 or 1964, without the safeguards typically used in nuclear transactions to prevent the material being used in weapons. Israel had few qualms about proliferating nuclear weapons knowhow and materials, giving South Africa&apos;s apartheid regime help in developing its own bomb in the 1970s in return for 600 tons of yellowcake.     Pictures of the secret Dimona nuclear reactor in Israel, showing where the plant has allegedly been camouflaged. Photograph: space imaging    Israel&apos;s nuclear reactor also required deuterium oxide, also known as heavy water, to moderate the fissile reaction. For that, Israel turned to Norway and Britain. In 1959, Israel managed to buy 20 tons of heavy water that Norway had sold to the UK but was surplus to requirements for the British nuclear programme. Both governments were suspicious that the material would be used to make weapons, but decided to look the other way. In documents seen by the BBC in 2005 British officials argued it would be &quot;over-zealous&quot; to impose safeguards. For its part, Norway carried out only one inspection visit, in 1961. Israel&apos;s nuclear-weapons project could never have got off the ground, though, without an enormous contribution from France. The country that took the toughest line on counter-proliferation when it came to Iran helped lay the foundations of Israel&apos;s nuclear weapons programme, driven by by a sense of guilt over letting Israel down in the 1956 Suez conflict, sympathy from French-Jewish scientists, intelligence-sharing over Algeria and a drive to sell French expertise and abroad. &quot;There was a tendency to try to export and there was a general feeling of support for Israel,&quot; Andre Finkelstein, a former deputy commissioner at France&apos;s Atomic Energy Commissariat and deputy director general at the International Atomic Energy Agency, told Avner Cohen, an Israeli-American nuclear historian. France&apos;s first reactor went critical as early as 1948 but the decision to build nuclear weapons seems to have been taken in 1954, after Pierre Mend\u00e8s France made his first trip to Washington as president of the council of ministers of the chaotic Fourth Republic. On the way back he told an aide: &quot;It&apos;s exactly like a meeting of gangsters. Everyone is putting his gun on the table, if you have no gun you are nobody. So we must have a nuclear programme.&quot; Mend\u00e8s France gave the order to start building bombs in December 1954. And as it built its arsenal, Paris solds material assistance to other aspiring weapons states, not just Israel. &quot;[T]his went on for many, many years until we did some stupid exports, including Iraq and the reprocessing plant in Pakistan, which was crazy,&quot; Finkelstein recalled in an interview that can now be read in a collection of Cohen&apos;s papers at the Wilson Centre thinktank in Washington. &quot;We have been the most irresponsible country on nonproliferation.&quot; In Dimona, French engineers poured in to help build Israel a nuclear reactor and a far more secret reprocessing plant capable of separating plutonium from spent reactor fuel. This was the real giveaway that Israel&apos;s nuclear programme was aimed at producing weapons. By the end of the 50s, there were 2,500 French citizens living in Dimona, transforming it from a village to a cosmopolitan town, complete with French lyc\u00e9es and streets full of Renaults, and yet the whole endeavour was conducted under a thick veil of secrecy. The American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh wrote in his book The Samson Option: &quot;French workers at Dimona were forbidden to write directly to relatives and friends in France and elsewhere, but sent mail to a phony post-office box in Latin America.&quot; The British were kept out of the loop, being told at different times that the huge construction site was a desert grasslands research institute and a manganese processing plant. The Americans, also kept in the dark by both Israel and France, flew U2 spy planes over Dimona in an attempt to find out what they were up to. The Israelis admitted to having a reactor but insisted it was for entirely peaceful purposes. The spent fuel was sent to France for reprocessing, they claimed, even providing film footage of it being supposedly being loaded onto French freighters. Throughout the 60s it flatly denied the existence of the underground reprocessing plant in Dimona that was churning out plutonium for bombs.     Producer Arnon Milchan with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the premiere of Mr and Mrs Smith. Photograph: L Cohen    Israel refused to countenance visits by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), so in the early 1960s President Kennedy demanded they accept American inspectors. US physicists were dispatched to Dimona but were given the run-around from the start. Visits were never twice-yearly as had been agreed with Kennedy and were subject to repeated postponements. The US physicists sent to Dimona were not allowed to bring their own equipment or collect samples. The lead American inspector, Floyd Culler, an expert on plutonium extraction, noted in his reports that there were newly plastered and painted walls in one of the buildings. It turned out that before each American visit, the Israelis had built false walls around the row of lifts that descended six levels to the subterranean reprocessing plant. As more and more evidence of Israel&apos;s weapons programme emerged, the US role progressed from unwitting dupe to reluctant accomplice. In 1968 the CIA director Richard Helms told President Johnson that Israel had indeed managed to build nuclear weapons and that its air force had conducted sorties to practise dropping them. The timing could not have been worse. The NPT, intended to prevent too many nuclear genies from escaping from their bottles, had just been drawn up and if news broke that one of the supposedly non-nuclear-weapons states had secretly made its own bomb, it would have become a dead letter that many countries, especially Arab states, would refuse to sign. The Johnson White House decided to say nothing, and the decision was formalised at a 1969 meeting between Richard Nixon and Golda Meir, at which the US president agreed to not to pressure Israel into signing the NPT, while the Israeli prime minister agreed her country would not be the first to &quot;introduce&quot; nuclear weapons into the Middle East and not do anything to make their existence public. In fact, US involvement went deeper than mere silence. At a meeting in 1976 that has only recently become public knowledge, the CIA deputy director Carl Duckett informed a dozen officials from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the agency suspected some of the fissile fuel in Israel&apos;s bombs was weapons-grade uranium stolen under America&apos;s nose from a processing plant in Pennsylvania. Not only was an alarming amount of fissile material going missing at the company, Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (Numec), but it had been visited by a veritable who&apos;s-who of Israeli intelligence, including Rafael Eitan, described by the firm as an Israeli defence ministry &quot;chemist&quot;, but, in fact, a top Mossad operative who went on to head Lakam. &quot;It was a shock. Everyody was open-mouthed,&quot; recalls Victor Gilinsky, who was one of the American nuclear officials briefed by Duckett. &quot;It was one of the most glaring cases of diverted nuclear material but the consequences appeared so awful for the people involved and for the US than nobody really wanted to find out what was going on.&quot; The investigation was shelved and no charges were made. A few years later, on 22 September 1979, a US satellite, Vela 6911, detected the double-flash typical of a nuclear weapon test off the coast of South Africa. Leonard Weiss, a mathematician and an expert on nuclear proliferation, was working as a Senate advisor at the time and after being briefed on the incident by US intelligence agencies and the country&apos;s nuclear weapons laboratories, he became convinced a nuclear test, in contravention to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, had taken place. It was only after both the Carter and then the Reagan administrations attempted to gag him on the incident and tried to whitewash it with an unconvincing panel of enquiry, that it dawned on Weiss that it was the Israelis, rather than the South Africans, who had carried out the detonation. &quot;I was told it would create a very serious foreign policy issue for the US, if I said it was a test. Someone had let something off that US didn&apos;t want anyone to know about,&quot; says Weiss. Israeli sources told Hersh the flash picked up by the Vela satellite was actually the third of a series of Indian Ocean nuclear tests that Israel conducted in cooperation with South Africa. &quot;It was a fuck-up,&quot; one source told him. &quot;There was a storm and we figured it would block Vela, but there was a gap in the weather \u2013 a window \u2013 and Vela got blinded by the flash.&quot; The US policy of silence continues to this day, even though Israel appears to be continuing to trade on the nuclear black market, albeit at much reduced volumes. In a paper on the illegal trade in nuclear material and technology published in October, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) noted: &quot;Under US pressure in the 1980s and early 1990s, Israel \u2026 decided to largely stop its illicit procurement for its nuclear weapons programme. Today, there is evidence that Israel may still make occasional illicit procurements \u2013 US sting operations and legal cases show this.&quot; Avner Cohen, the author of two books on Israel&apos;s bomb, said that policy of opacity in both Israel and in Washington is kept in place now largely by inertia. &quot;At the political level, no one wants to deal with it for fear of opening a Pandora&apos;s box. It has in many ways become a burden for the US, but people in Washington, all the way up to Obama will not touch it, because of the fear it could compromise the very basis of the Israeli-US understanding.&quot; In the Arab world and beyond, there is growing impatience with the skewed nuclear status quo. Egypt in particular has threatened to walk out of the NPT unless there is progress towards creating a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The western powers promised to stage a conference on the proposal in 2012 but it was called off, largely at America&apos;s behest, to reduce the pressure on Israel to attend and declare its nuclear arsenal. &quot;Somehow the kabuki goes on,&quot; Weiss says. &quot;If it is admitted Israel has nuclear weapons at least you can have an honest discussion. It seems to me it&apos;s very difficult to get a resolution of the Iran issue without being honest about that.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-01-15T18:18:54Z", "title": "The truth about Israel's secret nuclear arsenal", "sentences": ["According to Milchan&apos;s biography, by Israeli journalists Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman, he was recruited in 1965 by Israel&apos;s current president, Shimon Peres, who he met in a Tel Aviv nightclub (called Mandy&apos;s, named after the hostess and owner&apos;s wife Mandy Rice-Davies, freshly notorious for her role in the Profumo sex scandal)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/truth-israels-secret-nuclear-arsenal"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "Sudan", "Refugees", "Eritrea", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "Thousands of asylum-seekers who entered Israel illegally from Sudan and Eritrea have staged protests outside UN offices and foreign embassies in Tel Aviv, accusing Israel of neglecting its responsibilities under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.

Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    More than 50,000 asylum seekers from Africa have arrived in Israel in the past decade, creating a political problem for the government and causing social tensions with local residents in south Tel Aviv where many of them live. Unable to obtain legal work permits, they eke out an existence in dead-end jobs and live in fear of arrest by Israeli immigration officials. Populist Israeli politicians have seized on the issue, with one member of parliament branding the migrants a cancer and calling for their immediate deportation. After lengthy delays processing asylum applications \u2013 some 1,800 have been submitted and none have been approved \u2013 the migrants declared a strike two weeks ago and started demonstrating in an effort to pressure Israel into allowing them to stay. In a rare public comment earlier this month, Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, dismissed their protests. &quot;These are not refugees, but people who are breaking the law and whom we will deal with to the fullest extent of the law,&quot; Netanyahu told cabinet ministers. The migrants said they had higher hopes of compassion from Israel, a country that has previously absorbed successive waves of refugees. But the Israeli government says that while it will not force any of the migrants to return to Eritrea or Sudan against their will, it does not want them to stay either.     The migrants, primarily from Eritrea and Sudan, marched from downtown Tel Aviv to the embassies. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;Israel has never considered itself open to immigration on a broad scale [other than the special arrangements for Jewish immigrants],&quot; said Daniel Solomon, legal adviser to Israel&apos;s population and immigration authority. &quot;We see most of this group as illegal economic migrants.&quot; Solomon said no one would be forced to leave, but long-term illegal immigrants could be required to live in a desert detention centre for up to a year under a new immigration law that came into force in January 2012. Since the law was passed and a fence was constructed, largely sealing Israel&apos;s border on the desert, the amount of migrants has dwindled from 2,000 a month to single figures. Solomon said 2,500 migrants \u2013 including 2,000 Eritreans and Sudanese \u2013 had left Israel &quot;of their own free will&quot; during 2013 and a further 500 this month alone, spurred on by a $3,500 (\u00a32,100) grant to each from the Israeli government. Solomon said Israel was close to implementing an arrangement with a third African country that had agreed to accept thousands of the migrants. But a crowd of several hundred protesting outside the British embassy on the Tel Aviv seafront on Wednesday disagreed.

Its contents are to be published over eight days in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag, starting on Sunday with Himmler&apos;s letters to his wife Margarete. The letters portray a man whose cheerful mood is often at odds with the historical crime he helped to orchestrate. &quot;I am travelling to Auschwitz. Kisses, your Heini,&quot; he wrote to his wife before setting off to inspect the concentration camp where he directed the killing of some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews. Himmler and his wife shared antisemitic feelings, as well as a joint dislike of Weimar-era Berlin. &quot;Poor sweetie, has to tussle with those wretched Jews over money,&quot; the SS leader wrote to his spouse on 16 April 1928. In November 1938, after the Reichskristallnacht pogroms that her husband had directed, Margarete Himmler wrote in her diary: &quot;All this Jew business, when will this pack leave us so that we can enjoy our lives?&quot; &quot;I hate and will always hate the Berlin system, which will never latch on to you, you virtuous and pure woman,&quot; Himmler wrote in December 1927. &quot;Berlin is contaminated. Everyone only speaks of money,&quot; &quot;Marga&quot; wrote a year later. Himmler, who killed himself in British custody in L\u00fcneberg on 23 May 1945, styled himself as a Landsknecht or servant to his country, &quot;toughened up through 10 years of battle&quot; in a letter of 2 January 1928. Margarete describes her husband as &quot;an evil man with a tough and rough heart&quot;, but also writes: &quot;I am so lucky to have such an evil good man, who loves his evil wife as much as she loves him.&quot; Heinrich and Margarete Himmler had a daughter, Gudrun, in 1929. From late 1938, Himmler had an affair with his long-term secretary Hedwig Potthast, with whom he had two children. The newly discovered collection of documents is thought to have been found by US army officers in May 1945 in one of the Himmler family homes in Gmund, near the Tegernsee lake in the Bavarian Alps. Some of the documents seized by soldiers were confiscated soon after by the US intelligence service, which was collecting material to be used in the Nuremberg trials. But the cache of letters, photos and diaries is likely to have stayed in private hands. The archive resurfaced in Israel in the early 1980s but failed to gain public attention, partly thanks to the controversy around the forged &quot;Hitler diaries&quot; published by the news magazine Stern and the Sunday Times in 1983. They were then sold to the father of the Israeli film-maker Vanessa Lapa, whose documentary about Himmler, Der Anst\u00e4ndige (The Decent One), will premiere at the Berlin film festival next month. Welt am Sonntag claims that the Himmler letters tally with those passed into public hands in 1945 and have been authenticated by a number of experts. &quot;There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents in Tel Aviv,&quot; the former federal archivist Josef Henke told the newspaper.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-26T12:07:56Z", "title": "Himmler hoard of letters and diaries discovered in Israel", "sentences": ["The stash of documents from the Nazi era is currently held in a bank vault in Tel Aviv, but has been authenticated by the German federal archive, considered the world&apos;s leading authority on material from the period.", "&quot;There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents in Tel Aviv,&quot; the former federal archivist Josef Henke told the newspaper."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/himmler-hoard-letters-diaries-israel-nazi-leader"}, {"tags": ["Costa book awards", "Awards and prizes", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Mental health", "Health", "Society", "Schizophrenia", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "This has been one of the most eventful weeks so far in an already eventful life for Nathan Filer. On Saturday, it was his wedding \u2013 the culmination of a journey that began in spring 2012, with an unexpected proposal to his partner Emily while they were being held in an Israeli detention centre. Then on Tuesday he won the Costa Book of the Year award for his first novel, The Shock of the Fall, a trip to the podium that began in 2002, when he was training to be a mental health nurse. It was then that he first had the idea for his central character, Matthew Homes: a 19-year-old man playing and replaying the dark night, a decade before, when his older brother Simon, who had Down&apos;s syndrome, died suddenly in front of him. The novel went through many drafts, says Filer, being picked up and put away for months, even years. &quot;Basically, nothing from that first draft survived. But I consider it to be the same project because of that central character.&quot; Matthew is diagnosed with schizophrenia, but that&apos;s not all he has to deal with: the novel charts his mother falling apart after Simon&apos;s death; there&apos;s the story of a historic assault on another close family member; and another who is locked up in psychiatric care. One character is severely disabled physically, her son has to care for her \u2013 but what stops the novel swirling into a vortex of medication, guilt and suicidal thoughts is Matthew&apos;s humour. The novel has been compared to Vernon God Little, The Catcher in the Rye and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, all of which Filer read while he was writing it. The result matches them in the strength of its central voice. &quot;I should say that I am not a nice person,&quot; says Matthew in the opening line, before leading readers through the pet names and special handshakes he shares with his dad; the birthday party where one of Simon&apos;s friends systematically munches all the pineapple squares off the cheese-and-pineapple sticks; and the evenings with the family gathered in front of EastEnders (Simon has crush on Bianca). &quot;I&apos;m nineteen years old,&quot; says Matthew, &quot;and the only thing I have any control over in my entire world is the way I choose to tell this story. So I&apos;m hardly going to fuck about. It would be nice if you&apos;d try to trust me.&quot; The Costa judges have been unstinting in their praise. When The Shock of the Fall won the first novel category, back in early January, they said: &quot;It&apos;s so good it will make you feel a better person.&quot; Filer seems surprised by his win \u2013 the bookies had put him fourth in a field of five \u2013 and ambivalent about being interviewed. &quot;Obviously this is brilliant,&quot; he says, sitting up smartly in the suit he wore for his wedding, &quot;but it is also quite unsettling and huge, isn&apos;t it? People focusing on the book I&apos;m very happy with, because I&apos;m very proud of it and I think it&apos;s good. I&apos;m slightly less comfortable with people focusing on ...&quot; You? &quot;Yeah!&quot; Perched on the edge of the sofa, eating chips to line his stomach for a night of celebration ahead, he has the demeanour of someone who might make a break for it\u00a0at any minute. Filer already seems to have lived several lives: as well as being a mental health nurse and award-winning novelist, he has worked as a mental health researcher, toured the country as a performance poet, made an award-winning short film called Oedipus, lectured in creative writing at Bath Spa University and volunteered as a human rights activist in Palestine. He says he wasn&apos;t an avid reader as a child, but was always an avid writer, growing up with an older sister and a father who worked as a foreman at Rolls-Royce, then as a bus driver before retiring. His mother was a healthcare assistant in a general hospital, and when Filer dropped out of his first degree at Dartington College of Arts, where he&apos;d been studying theatre, he followed in her footsteps, before moving into mental healthcare.     The centre was vile, full of \u00adantisemitic graffiti \u2013 nonetheless they conceived their daughter there ... Nathan Filer with his wife, Emily, at the awards gala in London. Photograph: Richard Kendal/Barcroft Media    In 2009, having worked on The Shock of the Fall for seven years, he decided to study for a creative writing MA, making the novel his priority. That same year he met his partner Emily, who also works in mental health, and her interest in human rights led to them volunteering in Palestine. In 2011, the pair travelled to Hebron, working with the International Solidarity Movement. They taught English at a university, and offered what support they could to people whose houses had been demolished: they filmed one man in this situation, and put his story online. &quot;It&apos;s about raising awareness,&quot; says Filer. &quot;We would go to protests, to be there and observe. If international people are there, it&apos;s less likely the Israeli military will use heavy-handed tactics, so we were there to try to make things more peaceful, really.&quot; He says he loved being in Palestine and, about six months later, he and Emily travelled there to volunteer again. This time though, as soon as they arrived at the airport in Tel Aviv, they were taken into a side room and questioned, before being driven to a holding facility, to await deportation on the next plane home \u2013 their passport details had been taken by the Israeli military during a peaceful protest on their previous visit. Filer didn&apos;t feel he was in danger, but says he was furious, &quot;because we knew that the work we were doing was perfectly legal. We didn&apos;t break any Israeli laws, we&apos;re pro-human rights, peaceful\u00a0people.&quot; They had been searched repeatedly already, but on arrival at the holding facility, Filer was told to empty his pockets again in front of Emily. He tried to protest: he had a ring in his pocket, having planned to propose to her during the trip. But the guard insisted. &quot;I said, &apos;Oh well, you&apos;ve ruined everything.&apos; And I took out the ring \u2013 the box, in any case \u2013 so she saw it.&quot; He asked her to marry him right there and she agreed. The guard gave them a glass of Sprite to celebrate. As a result, they were given the family room at the facility. &quot;It was a pretty bleakly depressing place, really. There was a cot, and you just think holding a child here would be awful. There were stencils on the wall of children&apos;s characters, like the donkey from Shrek, but it was peeling off. And there was lots of really vile, antisemitic graffiti. It was just a really unsettling\u00a0place.&quot; Nonetheless, they conceived their daughter Ayda there, and were soon heading back to the UK, newly engaged and expecting. Ayda is now one, and was the chief flowergirl at their wedding. Filer has said he hopes she&apos;ll be a freedom fighter. &quot;I\u00a0keep saying she&apos;s going to win the Nobel peace prize, or the Pulitzer,&quot; he laughs, &quot;but obviously what I really want is for her to be happy, healthy, well-adjusted.&quot; While he does admit to borrowing traits from some of his relatives in shaping his characters, he doesn&apos;t really want to say more about his family. He is slightly more forthcoming when I ask if Matthew resembles how he was at 19. The book is set in Bristol where Filer, now 33, grew up. &quot;We were both teenagers in a similar area, and of a similar class, so I guess there&apos;s something in it. The thing is, without wanting to sound too pretentious, when you spend so long with a character and grow together, you influence each other a bit, don&apos;t you? I admire him, I suppose. He has a stoicism I don&apos;t have. He doesn&apos;t feel so sorry for himself as I might sometimes do. He&apos;s very brave and decent.&quot; Filer, who still does shifts on mental health wards, insists the book isn&apos;t specifically about schizophrenia, nor the NHS. But he did feel a responsibility to &quot;not propagate myths&quot;. Of all mental health diagnoses, schizophrenia is often the most stigmatised. &quot;Broadly speaking,&quot; he says, &quot;people hang on to that Jekyll and Hyde, split personality idea, which is not part of the diagnosis. It&apos;s not even nominally a part of it. And there&apos;s a misrepresentation of violence as well \u2013 which is not to say that violence can&apos;t be a part of it, but it&apos;s overrepresented in the media, especially the tabloids.&quot; He wrote movingly and bitingly last weekend, for this paper, about cuts to mental health services: the fact that since 2011, for instance, there has been a 9% reduction in beds for mental health patients across the NHS. I ask what this would mean for someone like Matthew. &quot;People are going to be more desperate before they get a bed, and they&apos;ll be discharged sooner, before meaningful recovery. It doesn&apos;t actually save money \u2013 that&apos;s the thing, it&apos;s myopic \u2013 because you close the beds and save money and people don&apos;t then just go and get better somewhere else. They get more and more unwell. Whereas you could have perhaps had a short, planned admission. Instead, they get so unwell they end up being picked up by the police [and sectioned]. We then have to find them a bed, because they&apos;ve been detained. They get sent 300 miles out of the area, or sent into the private sector, and the money is spent there, or the money is spent at A&amp;E or in the criminal justice system. So you haven&apos;t saved money, you&apos;ve just moved it on, while creating a kind of net misery.&quot; He&apos;s clearly still passionate about mental health, even though his success as a writer is such that he could have left all these concerns behind. When he finally finished The\u00a0Shock of the Fall, it was subject to an 11-way auction and was sold for a six-figure sum. It is being published in more than 10 countries this year, a tally likely to rise after this win. Filer says he&apos;ll always write \u2013 screenplays, articles, poetry \u2013 but he&apos;s surprisingly noncommittal about the idea of setting sail on another novel. &quot;I\u00a0am of course mindful that there&apos;s a degree of expectation. But really, that expectation belongs to other people. I\u00a0don&apos;t actually have to.&quot; He smiles and heads off for a glass of champagne.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T18:51:23Z", "title": "Costa winner Nathan Filer: 'This is huge, isn't it?'", "sentences": ["This time though, as soon as they arrived at the airport in Tel Aviv, they were taken into a side room and questioned, before being driven to a holding facility, to await deportation on the next plane home \u2013 their passport details had been taken by the Israeli military during a peaceful protest on their previous visit."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/nathan-filer-costa-award-shock"}, {"tags": ["Friends of the Earth", "Environment", "Water", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Residents of Tel Aviv will wake up in February to discover a huge hourglass full of polluted water standing in the city&apos;s central Rabin Square.

Gidon Bromberg, director of FoE in Tel Aviv, said the environment was being held hostage by the logjam in the Middle East peace process and internal Palestinian disputes between Hamas and Fatah. As the politicians dawdle, fresh drinking water is running out for the 1.7 million Palestinians in Gaza. Last November, the World Bank completed construction of a wastewater treatment plant designed to prevent pollution of the underground aquifer that provides fresh water to 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, but it stands idle, silenced by political wrangling. Gaza is dependent on Israel for most of its electricity supply but Israel is refusing to provide the extra three megawatts required to power the plant until Gaza&apos;s existing electricity bills are paid. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority cannot agree on who should settle the debt. &quot;Until a solution is found to provide electricity, untreated sewage will continue to contaminate the coastal aquifer and flow into the Mediterranean,&quot; said Bromberg. He said the waste also threatens to pollute an Israeli desalination plant in nearby Ashkelon. Unicef says that more than 90% of the water extracted from Gaza&apos;s sole aquifer is unfit for human consumption. More than four out of five Gazans buy their drinking water from expensive, unregulated private vendors. Most of it is contaminated. &quot;Some families are paying as much as a third of their household income on water,&quot; said June Kunugi, Unicef special representative for the State of Palestine. Unicef has helped provide 18 small neighbourhood desalination plants, providing free drinking water to 95,000 people. &quot;Residents receive access to drinking water once a week, which allows them to fill up their storage tanks at home with water that lasts until the next refill,&quot; said Sabri Al-Faleet, of al-Nuseirat municipality. &quot;Pollution crosses borders,&quot; declare the captions on the adverts accompanying the FoE campaign. &quot;Time is running out.

Pro-boycott campaigners believe they will benefit from the celebrity furore, even though Johansson \u2013 faced with the incompatibility of sponsorship of SodaStream, which has a factory in an illegal settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and her role as a goodwill ambassador for Oxfam \u2013 broke links with the charity. The row follows mounting pressure, especially from Europe, where NGOs, trade unions, churches and others are forcing their governments to take action. The number of European corporations who have severed or reviewed links with Israeli companies which operate in settlements is accelerating; the European Union is taking an increasingly tougher line; and the boycott movement is gaining traction in the United States, where it has previously struggled to win support. Estimates about the potential economic impact differ, but the alarm in Israel is palpable, as demonstrated by the furious reaction from Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s government when John Kerry, the US secretary of state, recently warned of more boycotts if current peace talks with the Palestinians fail. The issue is uncomfortable for the 500 Palestinians who work in SodaStream&apos;s factory at Mishor Adumim, an Israeli industrial park built on expropriated Arab land, part of a 1,300-strong mixed workforce.     Leah, a Jewish worker, and Nidaa, a Palestinian from Jericho, at the SodaStream factory in Mishor Adumim. Photograph: Heidi Levine/Sipa/Rex    &quot;We are against the boycott idea,&quot; said Nidaa, a Palestinian from Jericho, sitting next to an orthodox Jew on the production line. &quot;It would destroy us. Yes, this place is a settlement, but that&apos;s normal. It&apos;s easy to get here and it&apos;s a good place to work.&quot; Others agreed. &quot;This is about our jobs. It&apos;s not about politics here,&quot; said a colleague. &quot;Palestinian independence is a long way away.&quot; But, according to Omar Barghouti, founder of the Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, &quot;the political atmosphere has changed towards enforcing international law. Israel&apos;s impunity is being eroded. BDS is growing tremendously and that is affecting decision-makers everywhere. We are changing the discourse.&quot; BDS, insisted Barghouti, was &quot;no coalition of lefty intellectuals&quot; but was supported by Palestinians across the political spectrum, including nationalists and Islamists. Many advocate a two-state solution to the conflict with Israel, while others, including Barghouti, argue for a &quot;secular democratic state&quot; that would replace &quot;apartheid&quot; Israel \u2013 though how that would happen given the balance of forces remains unclear. According to the sociologist and writer Salim Tamari, an advocate of two states, &quot;the problem is that among many BDS people, there is no endgame&quot;. A weakness of Palestinian strategy is that a boycott of Israel on the ground has never made much headway. Shops in East Jerusalem and the West Bank are crammed with Israeli produce even when Palestinian goods are available at equivalent prices. &quot;If foreign banks are standing up for our rights, what are we doing?&quot; asks Mahdi Abdel-Hadi of the Passia thinktank. Barghouti counters this by speaking of the &quot;colonisation of the mind&quot; and sheer dependence on the occupation. &quot;We don&apos;t expect the criteria that we ask in Britain, Johannesburg or New York to apply in Ramallah or Jerusalem. We are a captive economy. Israel has over decades destroyed our industry and agriculture and confiscated our water resources. We do not expect our economic institutions to completely boycott Israel. That&apos;s unrealistic.&quot; Barghouti described his own attendance at Tel Aviv University, where he did an MA in philosophy and ethics, as a &quot;private matter&quot;. Al-Haq, a human rights organisation based in Ramallah, drew a distinction between boycotts, which it said were based on a moral judgment, and divestments based on the application of international law. &quot;Boycott is both a loaded and a vague term,&quot; said Wesam Ahmad of Al-Haq. &quot;It can mean everything to everyone. If you tell someone not to buy a product in a supermarket, you&apos;re not presenting a legal argument but a moral argument.&quot; But the work of the two organisations were complementary, said Ahmad, with Al-Haq focusing on the potential legal liability of a corporation or body, and employing rather more low-key tactics than the high-profile, high-pressure BDS approach to celebrities and public figures. &quot;We tell companies they may be contributing to a violation of international law. A company then has to make a risk assessment in order to protect its reputation and stock value in the event of a legal complaint \u2013 to ask itself what the cost is of continuing such activities,&quot; said Ahmad. According to Hanan Ashrawi, one of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation&apos;s most eloquent voices, a boycott &quot;is one way of engaging with and standing up to the occupation, and empowering individuals to take action&quot;. She added: &quot;It&apos;s gaining traction all over the world. We saw how effective it was in the South African struggle. It sends a very clear message that this occupation is costly in moral and economic terms. And if governments don&apos;t want to hold Israel accountable, the people will.&quot; Not surprisingly, the boycott issue is hotly debated in Israel. Avraham Burg, a doveish former speaker of the Knesset, wrote approvingly in Haaretz that Israel &quot;will remain helpless when confronted by a [Palestinian] civil rebellion that moves the discourse from who&apos;s stronger/tougher/more resilient to a discourse on rights and values. For this we have no answer.&quot; Other liberal commentators have suggested that one way of bringing home the cost of occupation for Israelis would be for EU countries to impose visa requirements. A controversial 2011 law banning support for boycotts is a constraint on public discussion. But Tom Segev, one of the country&apos;s leading historians, says: &quot;There has to be a situation where as many Israelis as possible understand \u2013 not through the use of terrorism \u2013 that their own lives are affected badly by the occupation.&quot; On the right there is anger and defiance and much talk of the &quot;delegitimisation&quot; of the Jewish state by the BDS movement. Naftali Bennet, Netanyahu&apos;s economy minister and leader of the Jewish Home party, says Israel can live without peace with the Palestinians and will not succumb to economic pressure. &quot;We expect our friends around the world to stand beside us, against antisemitic boycott efforts targeting Israel, and not for them to be their amplifier,&quot; was his blunt response to Kerry&apos;s warning. EU labelling of products from West Bank settlements triggers emotive references to yellow stars \u2013 the humiliating emblem Jews were forced to wear by European antisemites \u2013 and to the Nazi Nuremberg Laws. The financial impact is already being felt. Last year Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley lost $29m, or 14% of their income, because supermarkets in the UK and Scandinavia are shunning their peppers, dates and grapes. Yair Lapid, the finance minister, has warned that even a limited European boycott could cost Israel $3bn a year and destroy 10,000 jobs. At SodaStream&apos;s settlement factory, meanwhile, it was back to siphon production as usual this week, as the glare of the international spotlight faded. Outside the plant \u2013 an Israeli munitions factory in a previous incarnation \u2013 a modernist sculpture records the words of the Prophet Isaiah, exhorting peace. &quot;And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.&quot; The boycott wars, however, look set to go on.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-06T19:46:28Z", "title": "Scarlett Johansson row has boosted Israeli settlement boycott, say activists", "sentences": ["That&apos;s unrealistic.&quot; Barghouti described his own attendance at Tel Aviv University, where he did an MA in philosophy and ethics, as a &quot;private matter&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/scarlett-johansson-israeli-settlement-boycott-activists"}, {"tags": ["Managing your cashflow", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Business essentials", "Entrepreneurs", "Small business", "Business"], "article": "For many startups looking for that crucial seed funding to fuel the launch of their new business, pitching events provide an ideal platform to show investors that their venture is worth putting time and money into. But how far would you go to prove your business is an attractive investment? Startups around the world are stepping out of their comfort zones and taking extreme measures for the chance to turn their great ideas into successful ventures. Polar Bear Pitching Welcome to Oulu in northern Finland - a subarctic city of endless daylight in the summer and eternal darkness in the long winter months, when temperatures rarely rise above freezing and a blanket of crisp, white snow covers everything. Slipping into a pair of trunks or bikini and taking a refreshing dip is not the top of most people&apos;s to-do lists on a sub-zero day in February, but a group of fearless startups are hoping to do just that in the hope of securing much needed funding for their new business. The inaugural Polar Bear Pitching event on 7 February will see around 20 thick-skinned entrepreneurs from Finland and around the world plunge into a hole in the ice to deliver a winning pitch to potential investors. How much time they get to sell their idea will depend on how long they can stand the freezing cold water. It&apos;s an extreme endurance test which the organisers hope will kickstart a small business revolution in the city where the unemployment rate is as high as 14%. &quot;There are startups which want to show the world that no matter what kind of troubles there are, they are willing to take the risk and really put themselves in the game,&quot; explained the event&apos;s project manager Mia Kemppaala. &quot;There&apos;s the saying that the comfort zone is a beautiful place but nothing really grows in it. This event is where you really have to step out of your comfort zone and take big risks.&quot; According to Kemppaala, the event forces the companies to really think about what they want to say, because they won&apos;t be able to stay in the water longer than five minutes. Some, only seconds. If the investor is impressed by the pitch, a networking event after will allow them to approach the entrepreneur for more information. While doctors and a rescue team will be standing by to fish out any contestants who run into trouble, pitcher Niina Palmu is confident she&apos;ll last a full three minutes without freezing. The chief operating officer of fitness business the Laturi Corporation says she entered the event to show her customers that even the most difficult hurdles to health and happiness can be overcome. Ice-dipping is a Finnish tradition which Palmu has experienced before. She explained the secret to survival is regular practice: &quot;We are going into the water every working day, so the repetition is there and that is the key to building a new habit. What we have learned along the way is that team support is very important. We started at five seconds and the plan is to be able to increase the time by eight seconds every day.&quot; The Elevator World Tour The concept of the elevator pitch is nothing new - entrepreneurs have the time it takes for a lift to climb a tall building to pitch their idea. However, organisers of a global pitching event started in Canada have taken that concept to literal new heights. The Elevator World Tour is a series of pitching events taking place in some of the globe&apos;s most iconic towers. The idea is simple. A total of 100 startups compete for the chance to win $100,000 by sharing a one-minute ride on the lift with potential investors. If investors like their idea, they are allowed to do a longer pitch on stage in front of an audience. &quot;The point is to stand out and get noticed. 60 seconds isn&apos;t enough to sell your company but it&apos;s enough to garner the interest of an investor,&quot; said the event&apos;s creator, Philippe Telio. &quot;Typically companies need to not only explain the problems they&apos;re solving, but how they are uniquely doing that. It&apos;s not enough to have a generic solution.&quot; You&apos;ve only got a minute, he advises, so the most important thing is to strike an emotional chord with the person you&apos;re pitching to. Telio added: &quot;This is fast-paced, so investors get to see a lot of companies in a short space of time. The reality is that when you&apos;re listening to a pitch or interview, you form an opinion very quickly. If you can&apos;t figure out in the first 30 seconds or minute why you&apos;d want to invest in someone, you may not be interested to hear more.&quot; The event, which started life as part of the Montreal International Startup Festival in 2009, has already proved a success in Toronto and Tel Aviv, and is expected to arrive in Paris or Barcelona in March and New York in May. Speed funding Time is precious for most investors. So why bother wasting 15 or 30 minutes of your day waiting for an entrepreneur to get to the point when you can spend just a few minutes listening to a pitch which really delivers the pith of an idea? Much like the dating equivalent, speed funding puts investors at tables around a room and the hopeful startup has just four minutes to pitch their idea, before moving on to the next station. It&apos;s a short amount of time to sell an idea you may have been working on for months or years, but according to Angels Den CEO and founder, Bill Morrow, the success rate is proof that the concept works. Morrow, whose company has been running regular speed funding events in the UK for the past seven years, explains up to 50% of startups who attend find investment as a result. He said: &quot;One of the reasons speed funding works better than other pitching mechanisms is that it allows the business angels to ask really stupid questions, which in a big room of people, they would feel intimidated to do. That brings them confidence &quot;If you don&apos;t like somebody, you only have to spend four minutes talking to them. If there are some sparks you particularly like, then you pick up with them after. The average person who pitched at a recent night had four angels interested in them. One company had 15 and another 11. They still might not invest after that, but it entices them into another meeting at another time. That&apos;s all we ever look to do.&quot; Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T08:55:00Z", "title": "Going up or taking the plunge?

The confused-looking canine is wearing a black protective vest and wags his tail at points. &quot;Down with them, down with their spies!&quot; one fighter exclaims. It must be one of the most oddest prisoner-of-war propaganda videos in history. These dogs are being used in Afghanistan by the military to sniff out buried bombs and narcotics. But it&apos;s not the first time an animal has had military credentials, of course: horses were an essential part of warfare for thousands of years, and there have been many examples of animals being held for spying \u2013 it was only last year that the Egyptian police kept a stork behind bars for this crime (the suspected spying device was actually a tag intended by conservationists to track its migration). But what other roles do and could animals play in human warfare? 1. Sniffing and detection The bee is pretty intelligent, and honeybees have been trained to recognise the scent of bomb ingredients. Once trained, the bees are strapped into a cartridge and exposed to air samples \u2013 if the bee picks up the scent of explosives, a camera in the cartridge records its reaction. The company developing the technology intends the bees to be unstrapped at the end of their &quot;shift&quot;. Dolphins have extraordinary natural biological sonars and have been used by the US Navy to detect swimmers and divers. If an intruder is about, the dolphin touches the sensor on a boat, which in turn alerts the handler. The dolphin is trained to swim to the intruder, bump him or her from behind and swim away while military personnel take over. MI5 once intended to have a gerbil spycatcher. The plan in the 1970s was to recruit a team of specially trained gerbils to detect spies and terrorists flying into the UK. This was because the furry animals can detect a rise in adrenalin from the scent of human sweat. This was actually put into practice by Israel, and gerbil cages were put on the side of security checks for travellers at Tel Aviv airport. The scheme was aborted when the Israelis found that the gerbils could not tell the difference between threats to aviation and passengers scared of flying. 2. Carriers Voytek the soldier bear was an important mascot adopted by Polish troops in 1943, after an Iranian boy gave the cub to a Polish refugee in exchange for cans of food. Yoytek grew into a 6ft, 250lb bear and was trained to carry mortar shells, boxes of ammunition, and the bare necessities for the soldiers. In 1944, he was officially enlisted in the Polish army and was a hero of the second world war, with name, rank and number. Horses, donkeys and mules have carried and pulled for many armies through history. 3. Espionage Insect cyborgs could be developed for espionage and detection. A proposal from the US&apos;s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) for a hybrid insect micro-electro-mechanical systems (Hi-Mems) programme says insects could have electronic controls implanted during the early stages of metamorphosis so that tissue can grow around them. The idea is that a small chip is put in the larva, and as it morphs into a beautiful caterpillar, it reorganises its nervous system. It then integrates itself with the circuit \u2013 in theory allowing handlers to transmit signals to the chip and then control the insect&apos;s behaviour. The idea is that cyborg caterpillars would carry recording devices or gas sensors to detect chemical attacks.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T18:44:51Z", "title": "War Horse has nothing on spycatching gerbils and ammo-fetching bears", "sentences": ["This was actually put into practice by Israel, and gerbil cages were put on the side of security checks for travellers at Tel Aviv airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/feb/07/war-horse-gerbils-bears-animals-wartime-taliban"}, {"tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Phoenix"], "article": "Phoenix, On tour Phoenix&apos;s frontman Thomas Mars is someone who seems to have it all.

Bankrupt! then, seems like an odd title for their fifth album. As it turns out, though, the reason for that is a positive one. Rather than an empty account, the band have lately found themselves without creative baggage, and felt the urge to surge forward. In truth, Bankrupt! is probably a bit less exciting than that makes it sound, but it is still a fine record: as experimental as they might think they&apos;re being, the band&apos;s natural position is slick and melodic, 1980s-influenced pop.

Maker of agreeably low-key and mystical records like his Dagger Paths EP, Barnes takes &quot;urban&quot; tropes like loops and reverberating drum patterns and places them in very different contexts. Rather than a soundtrack to the city at night, Barnes is all about a more rural kind of menace, one that conjures the similarly moody work of Mogwai and Boards Of Canada.

A rock&apos;n&apos;roll band, but one who want to build from the ground up, the band&apos;s best-case scenario (as displayed on their Champagne Holocaust album of 2013) is a kind of primitive, atmospheric space-rock.

McFarlane&apos;s charisma as a performer would certainly have ignited her present rapid rise, but her vision as a songwriter is accelerating that momentum, with this UK tour unveiling her second album for Gilles Peterson&apos;s Brownswood label. If You Knew Her features eight originals dedicated to the &quot;vibrant, amazing, charismatic black women in my life&quot;, sometimes expressed with nothing but piano, bass or the hang drum for support, sometimes fuelled by the energies of her lively young band.

Where Midsummer Marriage was a gloriously indulgent work, Priam was its complete opposite. Tippett remodelled his musical language to compose it, and the result is terse, pared down and unflinchingly confrontational in its retelling of the story from Homer&apos;s Iliad of the beginnings of the Trojan war.

He applied it to a small house in Uppsala, in his native Sweden, designed in 1949 by his contemporaries Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm and built of bricks. Were it not for that material, the house might stand as the very example of the light, ascetic, prim, nordic modernism that afflicted Britain for some years after the war. The Festival of Britain in\u00a01951 was actually The Festival of Plagiarising Scandinavian Architecture. Asplund&apos;s neologism caught on in Stockholm and was picked up by British architectural pilgrims to that city, among them Oliver Cox, Graeme Shankland and Michael Ventris, the decoder of Linear B (an ancient script seen as one of the great linguistic riddles). Although the epithet signified nothing, or maybe because it signified nothing, it was taken up as a slogan of defiance or something by arty young British architects, none artier than Alison and Peter Smithson and their representative on Earth, Reyner Banham, an architectural critic whose prose may cause all but the entirely insentient to wince. The Smithsons&apos; Hunstanton School in Norfolk, finished in 1954, derives from Mies van der Rohe and has little in common with subsequent buildings that were deemed brutalist. B\u00e9ton brut Banham expanded Asplund&apos;s coinage, turning it into a bilingual pun on the French b\u00e9ton brut \u2013 literally raw concrete. Exposed concrete, left rough and unfinished, would become the defining trait of brutalism. So Banham, with his weakness for feeble wordplay, linked brutality with concrete, even though there had\u00a0been concrete structures since the\u00a0Romans, most of them pacific. The shared etymology of brut and brutal was unfortunate. Monoglot opponents of brutalist buildings \u2013 knowing nothing of b\u00e9ton brut and apprised only of the English component, brutal \u2013 were handed the ammunition of what seems like a boast of culpable aggression. Or maybe not: the French, to whom the pun was clear, have been no more appreciative of their brutalist buildings than the English. Cit\u00e9 Radieuse Before the war, Le Corbusier&apos;s work was sleek, smooth, right-angled, rational. Postwar, he led the reaction against such architecture: he dumped a technical manual in favour of ecstatic poetry. La Cit\u00e9 Radieuse in Marseille, aka l&apos;Unit\u00e9 d&apos;Habitation, was the first of his\u00a0exercises in sculptural and plastic moulded concrete which, in spirit if not style, have affinities with the primitivist tendency of the arts and crafts. L&apos;Unit\u00e9 gave the word brutalism a meaning. Le Corbusier ripped off countless other artists and architects, notably Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pablo Picasso and most importantly Friedrich Tamms. Indeed, his later oeuvre can be viewed as a synthesis of thefts. Le Corbusier never applied the word brutalist to his own work.     Tricorn Centre, Portsmouth. Photograph: View Pictures/Rex    Dystopia Brutalism is the decor of dystopian films, literature and comics, just as gothic is for horror. See Alphaville, A Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, Get Carter, La Haine. Books and films have of course impinged on the way brutalist buildings have been judged down the years, assisting in their condemnation. They have been found wanting beside the holyhocked cottages and winking dormers beloved by Blighty. Expressionism Brutalism, as Nikolaus Pevsner pointed out with some distaste, had its roots in expressionism, the jagged, often counter-intuitive, mostly brick idiom that flourished in the Netherlands, Germany and the Baltic states from 1910 to 1930. Its greatest exponent was Michel de Klerk, whose social housing projects in Amsterdam retain, a century after they were made, a beguiling freshness. Its kitschiest exponent was Bernhard Hoetger. His B\u00f6ttcherstrasse in Bremen, a street 100m long, was commissioned by the inventor of decaffeinated coffee, Ludwig Roselius, who dedicated it to Adolf Hitler. At the 1936 Nuremberg Rally, Hitler showed his gratitude by declaring it decadent.     Gottfried B\u00f6hm's Mariendom, in Neviges, Germany    F\u00f6rderer Vatican II was a godsend to architects. The Roman Catholic church was a generous, adventurous patron, and its buildings were to be advertisements for the church&apos;s newfound modernity. With few functional demands to take into consideration, architects enjoyed carte blanche. God can, apparently, live anywhere \u2013 and in the 1960s, he shared the widespread taste for open-plan spaces and theatre-in-the-round. The boundary between architecture and sculpture, which Le Corbusier had broached, was now comprehensively trampled. The architects who most took advantage of this were Walter F\u00f6rderer in Switzerland and Germany, Gottfried B\u00f6hm in and around Cologne, and Fritz Wotruba in Vienna. Their work defines brutalism. It is accretive, ostentatious, hyperbolic in its asymmetries and protracted voids, composed of parts that do not connect or are in a fragmentary state, dramatically vertiginous, geometrically farouche, extravagantly cantilevered, discomfiting, aggressive (in so far as an inanimate object can be \u00a0aggressive). There is no desire to please with prettiness or even beauty. The reaction demanded is that of awe. The quality that the greatest brutalist buildings manifest is sublimity. Geology Brutalist architecture did not seek to represent geological formations. It sought to create buildings that matched such formations, even challenged them. Mankind could take on nature and win, could make its own yardangs and hoodoos. Half a century ago, mankind lorded it over the earth. The practices of being friendly to vegetables and minerals, and of granting rights to animals were far in the future \u2013 though they had, of course, been de rigueur in Germany for 12 years, from the Nazis&apos; seizure of power to their defeat. H To anyone under the age of 50, brutalism belongs to the age of their non-existence. It is something that happened in history, while postmodernism is still with us. But now, having ransacked all other dressing-up boxes, architects have gradually turned to brutalism for inspiration. The most prolific is Jurgen Mayer Hermann, who trades as J Mayer H. His border checkpoints and service stations in Georgia might, at first glance, be taken for works of the 1960s \u2013 they are uncompromising, assertive, convinced of the artist&apos;s right to impose his vision without consultation, without accommodating consensual taste. Imperial College London Sheppard Robson&apos;s magnificent hall of\u00a0residence in South Kensington was finished in 1963 and demolished 42 years later. It is not shown on the practice&apos;s website. Nor are its slightly later and happily extant lecture halls at Brunel University. Are its current architects embarrassed by their predecessors&apos; work? Uneasy about how potential clients might react? Imperial College has form in this area. Some professor of a &quot;discipline&quot; called Sustainable Energy in Business defends the destruction of cooling towers thus: &quot;You have to think: how much does this enhance the landscape compared to what else we could do if we weren&apos;t having to maintain the towers?&quot; This is the very epitome of unreflective short-termism and a not-particularly-convincing justification for sanctioned vandalism. Jasari The School of Advanced Proxenetism, in Albania&apos;s capital Tirana, was designed by the late Nexhat Jasari, whose other works included soundproofed containers, experimental dungeons and the Presidential Bison Run.     Jonathan Meades in front of Skopje post office, Macedonia. Photograph: Francis Hanly/BBC    Konstantinov   Skopje \u2013 in Macedonia, then the southernmost Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \u2013 was largely destroyed by an earthquake in July 1963. The masterplan for rebuilding the city was undertaken by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. Most of the actual buildings were designed by Yugoslav architects, among them Janko Konstantinov, whose post-office complex presages the wild and delirious spomenik memorials to the National Liberation War (ie the second world war). President Tito commissioned scores of these futuristic melds of architecture and sculpture, some of which have been recorded by Belgian photographer Jan Kempenaers. Many, however, were destroyed during the 1990s civil wars. Konstantinov&apos;s work also presages the weirdly joyous style of the later years of the Soviet satellites, the Leonid Brezhnev Plays Las Vegas school of architecture. Much of this has been recorded by the French photographer Fr\u00e9deric Chaubin.     The Trinity Square car park, Gateshead. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA    Luder The three finest works of British brutalism were designed by Rodney Gordon of the Owen Luder Partnership. They were: Eros House in Catford, London; the Tricorn in Portsmouth; and the Trinity in Gateshead. The first, a block of flats, is disfigured; the other two shopping centre and car park complexes have been destroyed in acts of petty-minded provincial vandalism. One can have nothing but contempt for the scum-of-the-earth councillors, blind planners and toady local journalists who conspired to effect the demolition of such masterpieces. One can only despair at the pusillanimous lack of support from wretched English Heritage. The dependably crass Prince of Wales, the man who sullied Dorset with Poundbury, described the Tricorn as &quot;a mildewed lump of elephant droppings&quot;, a simile as vulgar as it is visually inept. No doubt his heritage industry toadies removed their tongues in order to chortle a moment&apos;s laughter. The critic Ian Nairn was on the money: &quot;This great belly laugh of forms ... the only thing that has been squandered is imagination.&quot; Gordon&apos;s imagination was indeed fecund, rich, untrammelled. It was haunted by Russian constructivism, crusader castles, Levantine skylines. But the paramount desire was to make an architecture that had not previously existed. There are as many ideas in a single Gordon building as there are in the entire careers of most architects. The seldom-photographed street level stuff at the Trinity left the observer with the sensation of being in the presence of genius. One thinks of the burning of books. Monstrosity It took more than three-quarters of a\u00a0century before high Victorian architecture began to be rehabilitated through the efforts of John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, etc. Their pleas went unheeded. They were reckoned to be perverse and mischievous. Thousands of &quot;monstrosities&quot; were destroyed. The survivors are now widely valued, and lost ones are mourned. We\u00a0have learned nothing. Half a century after brutalism&apos;s heyday, the\u00a0term &quot;concrete monstrosity&quot; trips\u00a0readily off the tongues of the unseeing, the torpid, the incurious. Britain is once again being architecturally cleansed in favour of timidity and\u00a0insipidity. New Newness and change were bound to be for the better. When Harold Macmillan announced in 1957 that &quot;most of our people have never had it so good&quot;, some of our people were still living in caves (in the Severn valley), and many of our people had no bathrooms and shared outdoor toilets. Built along brutalist lines, new flats had all those amenities, plus central heating, and were welcomed by their occupants. Social-housing projects were not yet bins for sociopaths. But they would soon become so: if blocks are unguarded, if there are no janitors, if they are not maintained \u2026 You don&apos;t buy a car and never get it serviced. Organisation Todt The Nazis&apos; civil-engineering arm, named after Fritz Todt, built motorways and arranged their surrounds in order to achieve minimal damage to the landscape. These animal-lovers were nothing if not green. From the outbreak of war, its work was almost entirely martial. After Todt&apos;s death in 1942, the OT was directed by Albert Speer. Its architects included Werner March, author of the 1936 Berlin Olympics stadium, and the startlingly prolific Friedrich Tamms, who created the designs for 60 different types of gun emplacement, bunkers, shelters, flak towers, U-boat bases, etc. Tamms was, arguably, the first brutalist. He revived the expressionism that the Nazis had proscribed. The forms he used were seldom functional. Rather, they employ the imagery of might \u2013 vizors, chainmail fists, anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. They were terrifyingly graphic warnings to the people of occupied countries.     Sainte Bernadette church, Nevers. Photograph: Collection Artedia/VIEW    Parent The church of Saint Bernadette in Nevers, France, consecrated in 1966, is the work of architect Claude Parent and theorist Paul Virilio. For some years, they had been studying the thousands of structures that comprise the Atlantic Wall, the coastal fortifications built \u2013 by slave labour \u2013 along the west of Europe from 1940-44. The similarities between these structures and brutalist architecture had been brushed under the carpet. In their huge bunker-like church, Parent and Virilio make the link explicit. Quebec Canada&apos;s most extreme examples of brutalism are in Quebec City, which boasts Dimitri Dimakopoulos&apos;s boorish Concorde Hotel; and in Quebec Province, home to Moshe Safdie&apos;s thrilling Habitat 67, a collision of 150 residential units in\u00a0Montreal that appear to teeter perilously. The effect is both fragmented and monolithic: a labyrinth made by termites with an eye for right angles. Robbins The Committee on Higher Education, chaired by economist Lionel Robbins, sat from 1961-63. Its report recommended a massive expansion of tertiary education. New universities were to be built. Old universities and colleges were to be extended. One reaction was Kingsley Amis&apos;s observation that &quot;more will mean worse&quot;. Another was delight on the part of architects who saw an incomparably rich gravy train approaching. Denys Lasdun&apos;s University of East Anglia is perhaps the finest of the lot. The Roger Stevens building at Leeds \u2013 by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon \u2013 is agreeably weird. One minor nail, a drawing pin, in brutalism&apos;s coffin was its rapid espousal by the Wilsonian establishment, which caused half-witted spartist protest-kids to identify it with repressive authority. Soreq Those protest-kids have no doubt directed many howls of self-righteous anger at the Soreq Nuclear Research Plant in Israel. The architect was Philip Johnson who, in his long life (he lived to 99 and never retired), had jumped on many bandwagons and even started a few. One of this creepy socialite&apos;s many enthusiasms was Hitler, which makes an Israeli commission a matter of wonder. While his brutalist buildings in the US are as unconvincing as most of his oeuvre, this temple to radiation on the dunes a few miles south of Tel Aviv is impressive. Brutalism was the cold war&apos;s architectural mode, on both sides of the Iron Curtain \u2013 Mutually Assured Construction.     Kenzo Tange's Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre, Kofu, Japan    Tange Kenzo Tange&apos;s viscerally exhilarating Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre in the Japanese city of Kofu is a vast machine that seems to be missing vital parts. His Kuwait embassy in Tokyo might have been assembled from several vaguely similar extant buildings, while the Shizuoka press centre is all cages attached to a stout pole. Elsewhere, Tange hangs cantilevers at oblique angles and creates buildings that look as if they are in the process of collapsing. Utzon The Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon is celebrated for the Sydney Opera House. His essays in brutalism were failures, tentative and timid. Indeed, this was an idiom for which Scandinavians seemed to have had no stomach. A tragic lack of insensitivity and an excess of rationality no doubt militated against its adoption. Vanbrugh The proto-brutalist John Vanbrugh&apos;s buildings were widely lambasted while he was still alive. Blenheim was described as &quot;a quarry&quot;. When he died, the Reverend Abel Evans famously wrote: &quot;Lie heavy on him earth! For he\u00a0/laid many a heavy a load on thee.&quot; World&apos;s End This estate of seven London towers, between King&apos;s Road and the Embankment, was designed by Jim Cadbury-Brown and Eric Lyons. More than any other London scheme, it demonstrates brutalism&apos;s debt to expressionism, explicitly that of Hamburg and Bremen. It is restless, angular, red brick, complicated. Cadbury-Brown&apos;s earlier work included the Royal College of Art, an equally commanding presence. X Team X was a loose grouping of youngish architects, manifesto folk, who in 1953 broke\u00a0with CIAM (Congr\u00e8s International d&apos;Architecture Moderne) to pursue a less rational architecture \u2013 in other words, they had understood\u00a0the prevailing change of\u00a0mood. The\u00a0group included Le Corbusier&apos;s collaborators Shadrach Woods and George Candelis, who had been instrumental in changing that mood, and the Smithsons. In\u00a0Rachel Cooke&apos;s Her Brilliant Career, there is a photograph of the teenage Alison Smithson. At first\u00a0glance, it appears to be Kevin Rowland in Dexy&apos;s ragamuffin period. This is worrying. Yale Paul Rudolph began his career, in Florida, by designing light and airy houses, mostly of modular construction. He moved from these chamber\u00a0pieces to full-blown and very noisy\u00a0symphonies: massive, lumbering, sullen campus buildings that manifest a spectacular indifference to what anyone thinks of them. This is sod-you-ism at its most stubborn. One is obviously led to think of clumsy robots sodomising each other. Rudolph was dean of Yale&apos;s architecture school and author of that faculty&apos;s building. Among his pupils were Richard Rogers\u00a0and Norman Foster. Photoshop Rogers&apos;s Lloyds building and render it\u00a0as though it were built of concrete. Zapotec During the 1920s, there was a California craze for neo-Mayan architecture or, more precisely, exterior decoration. The pre-Columbian modes that attracted attention in the 1960s were the Zapotec and the Inca: massive, bold, cyclopean, devoted to 45\u00b0 slopes. Where building ends and natural formations begin is often moot. \u2022 Jonathan Meades&apos;s Bunkers, Brutalism, Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry starts on BBC4 at 9pm on Sunday. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2014 to correct Evans&apos;s epigram on Vanbrugh.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T07:00:00Z", "title": "The incredible hulks: Jonathan Meades' A-Z of brutalism", "sentences": ["While his brutalist buildings in the US are as unconvincing as most of his oeuvre, this temple to radiation on the dunes a few miles south of Tel Aviv is impressive."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/13/jonathan-meades-brutalism-a-z"}, {"tags": ["Weekend fashion special spring/summer 2014", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Homeland", "Drama", "Mad Men", "Historical drama", "US television", "Fresh Meat", "Comedy", "House of Cards", "Parks and Recreation", "Zawe Ashton", "Helen Mirren", "Elisabeth Moss", "Gillian Anderson"], "article": "Carrie Mathison, Homeland American Vogue loves to put serene, beautiful actresses on its cover; crotchety-faced, nervous-wreck federal agents, not so much.

Her gaberdine and leather Burberry trench was tightly buttoned, the collar turned up incongruously against the August weather; her hands were thrust into the pockets, her gaze cool and level. In one of the pictures inside, Danes was in a\u00a0surveillance van, wearing a knee-length Victoria Beckham sheath dress accessorised with bulky headphones and trademark crossed-arm pose. Similarly, when Danes starred in a\u00a0fashion shoot for the New York Times&apos;s T magazine, she was wearing Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Valentino, but still recognisably Carrie, with that shiny, natural hair, posing against the backdrop of Tel Aviv.

A tight ponytail and tiny, fearful fringe topped off a motley collection of overly fussy blouses tucked unflatteringly into frumpy skirts in pukesome shades of green and beige. Everything screamed social and sexual immaturity and vulnerability, which, of course, attracted the disgusting Pete Campbell to her as blood attracts sharks. This in turn led to an interlude of secret maternity wear, followed by secret baby and secret adoption. A girl grows up fast under these conditions, and since then Peggy&apos;s wardrobe has \u2013 like the woman herself \u2013 become less fussy, more focused, more put-together. Ponytail and separates have gone out, a bob and dresses have come in. But it is still clearly armour. Necks are high, patterns sober, hemlines sensible, at least for the 1960s. They are not chosen with fun, comfort, self-expression or any other frivolity in mind. They&apos;re there to help her in the job she&apos;s doing among men who \u2013 despite, or more likely because of, her success \u2013 will still seize any opportunity to do her down. I suspect her personal taste and professional needs will finally converge in the 80s pant suit \u2013 though, God and Matthew Weiner willing, the series won&apos;t stray beyond 1979. Lucy Mangan Vod Nordstrom, Fresh Meat     Zawe Ashton as Vod Nordstrom in Fresh Meat. Photograph: Richard Saker    Fresh Meat captures the lives of six university students foraging for meaningful friendship amid carpet stains and penne pesto. There&apos;s a\u00a0posh one, a sensitive one, a\u00a0pretentious one, a good-time girl, a\u00a0geek \u2013 and then there&apos;s Vod: magnificent, hedonistic, goofy, uninhibited Vod. The daughter of an RAF officer and a boozy mother, Vod is both insecure and full of bluster, with an anti-establishment streak that seeks outlet through spliffs, pints and bovver boots. Her wardrobe is an experimental mish-mash of mixed messages: braces, blue lipstick, a rocker quiff and a\u00a0leopard-skin dressing gown. Zawe Ashton, the actor who plays Vod, told the Guardian last year: &quot;I\u00a0always describe her as having no subtext, no filters. The whole birth of that character was so much about hair and makeup and wardrobe.&quot; Vod is largely uninterested in looking feminine, save for a BP-sponsored university event where she dressed in full ballgown, only to clamber on a table, unleash bags of fake oil from under her skirt and cry: &quot;Carry on stuffing your faces with sausages \u2013 ignore the oil spill!&quot; She&apos;s bold, unnerving and a little bit wrong \u2013 but who cares?Rosie Swash Jane Tennison, Prime Suspect     Helen Mirren as Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect. Photograph: ITV/Rex    What I most love about DCI Jane Tennison&apos;s clothes is that DCI Tennison doesn&apos;t really give a\u00a0damn about them. Yes, she looks chic and stylish in her simple blouses and plain tailoring (it&apos;s hard to make Helen Mirren look bad, in all honesty), but her image is largely unimportant to her. Lynda La Plante&apos;s heroine doesn&apos;t think about\u00a0fashion any more than her male colleagues, who, though not blessed with Tennison&apos;s room-hushing sexuality, are dressed in similarly bland suits. Sometimes we\u00a0see Tennison stir after a late night of heavy drinking and obsessing over evidence, having slept in her crumpled workwear. And even when she&apos;s on top of her game, nothing is overdone; every last detail feels authentic. Her shoes\u00a0are always sensible courts, never dominatrix heels. She goes for soft tailoring, not power suits with sharp angles and jumbo shoulder pads. Her shirts look stylish, but generic and robust enough to deal with the odd yolk stain at post-briefing fry-ups with the lads from the station. Nothing is perfect, everything is functional, ticking all the right boxes, while her attention remains firmly on the job at hand. The sheer ordinariness of her wardrobe \u2013 when, nowadays, female detectives such as Stella Gibson in The Fall must appear as though fresh from a Whistles sample sale, or like Sarah Lund, as famous for her jumpers as for her ace detective work \u2013 is exactly what makes DCI Tennison&apos;s such an unforgettable look.Sali Hughes Claire Underwood, House Of Cards     Robin Wright as Claire Underwood in House Of Cards. Photograph: Kobal Collection    Say what you like about Claire Underwood, the blond, terrifying one played by Robin Wright in House Of Cards: her wardrobe is cold, hard perfection. As one half of a Washington DC power couple, Underwood knows that perception is everything, and dresses accordingly. At work, she is pristine in form-fitting shift dresses, crisp shirts, mannish trousers, tailored overcoats and expensive accessories: Louboutins, perhaps, or an Yves Saint Laurent tote. By night, at the Capitol Hill galas where she publicly swaps longing looks and urbane witticisms with her husband, she binds herself into chic, corseted gowns and strapless cocktail dresses. Whatever the occasion, her palette is as controlled as her small talk: black, navy, charcoal, pewter, cream, white. Every outfit shows off her tanned, gym-toned biceps and lithe, bare legs (hosiery is for wimps). From her precise fringe to her sharp stiletto heels, Underwood&apos;s look projects control. It&apos;s a perfectly curated aesthetic that confirms her as the commander of her own tastefully accessorised destiny; the wearer will never be found slobbing out in a holey T-shirt or accidentally inhaling a pint of Ben\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Jerry&apos;s Phish Food. And yet it&apos;s not much of a spoiler to reveal that Underwood is as battered and broken as the rest of us, if not more so. As House Of Cards progresses, you wonder whether those beautiful corsets are the only things holding her together.Hannah Marriott Stella Gibson, The Fall     Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson in The Fall. Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC    I always suspected that power blouses were unwearable by mortals like me, who live in the same world as bra straps, spaghetti bolognese and an ironing deficit. Watching Gillian Anderson coolly cut a swath through BBC crime drama The Fall in a succession of the glorious things left me wholly convinced. Anderson played a murder detective who worked with a certain stillness, even when calmly practising strangulation techniques on her own wrist, or accepting sex from a man at her hotel door by merely reaching for the Do Not Disturb sign. Those silken, cream-coloured blouses were part of that stillness, yet they almost revealed her flesh; a\u00a0hint of woman in a man&apos;s world. These are blouses that make a\u00a0subtle joke about their own femininity; associated with Tory wives who pretend to be ladylike while actually wearing the trousers, or royal women who have to look pretty for the camera while commanding with a will of steel. In fact, a plain silk blouse is one of the sexiest things you can put on, if you&apos;re not really meant to be wearing clothes that make people look at you. I\u00a0dread to\u00a0think how much you have to spend on one that sits right on the\u00a0body like Gibson&apos;s, effortless and\u00a0breezy as expensive milk. Sophie Heawood Leslie Knope, Parks And Recreation     Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope in Parks And Recreation. Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK/Rex    I admit, the reason I love Leslie Knope&apos;s wardrobe has a lot more to do with Leslie Knope than with the clothes. In Knope, Amy Poehler has created one of the truly great female TV characters: bursting with ambition, unflappably optimistic, indefatigably gauche and, most of all, eternally good-hearted. And her all-time idol is\u2026 Joe Biden. If you don&apos;t love this woman, you have no soul. Knope&apos;s clothes reflect her character perfectly in that the underlying ingredients should be awful but, put all together, they become surprisingly endearing, even inspirational. Those brisk skirt suits and 1970s trouser suits could look C&amp;A, but on Knope they bespeak an ambitious woman who is unfettered by feminine concerns about prettiness or elegance, one who dreams of being Hillary Clinton but is really, well, Leslie Knope. Her bolshiness and lack of self-deprecation should be an inspiration to us all, with or without the brown trouser suit. Her off-duty style depends on her mood: on bad days, it&apos;s teenager-like hoodies and jeans; on\u00a0special nights out, it&apos;s mainstream pretty dresses. In other words, her wardrobe is the same as 90% of western women. But Leslie shows us how to Knope it up.Hadley Freeman", "publicationDate": "2014-02-15T09:00:00Z", "title": "The detective wore Prada: fashion on TV", "sentences": ["Similarly, when Danes starred in a\u00a0fashion shoot for the New York Times&apos;s T magazine, she was wearing Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Valentino, but still recognisably Carrie, with that shiny, natural hair, posing against the backdrop of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/feb/15/fashion-tv-homeland-mad-men-fresh-meat-fall"}, {"tags": ["Cabaret", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Stage", "Culture", "Theatre"], "article": "Certain art forms lend themselves to the Israel-Palestine conflict: epic, despondent, near-silent cinema, say, or interminable sagas about intransigent politics. But a camp, twinkle-eyed cabaret fronted by a man in gold lam\u00e9 evening dress? This is Ballad of the Burning Star, a\u00a0fiercely emotional attempt to understand the complexity of the occupation and its psychological impact on Israeli and Palestinian people. The show&apos;s highly successful run at the Edinburgh festival last summer was also contentious, with some people walking out, furious at its perceived antisemitism, and one man attempting to halt proceedings for a live debate. As Burning Star sets off on a UK tour,\u00a0Nir Paldi \u2013 the man who wrote, co-directed and stars in the show \u2013 seems sanguine about how it might be received. &quot;For me,&quot; he explains, &quot;it&apos;s not talking about Israel and Palestine. It&apos;s talking about my life, where I grew up and my reality.&quot; Born and raised in Israel, Paldi now lives in the UK, and finds that every time he tells someone where he&apos;s from, &quot;it&apos;s like releasing a nest of wasps in the air. People want to tell you what they think about the situation, and expect you to be articulate about what you think.&quot; Paldi, however, has never enjoyed such confidence. &quot;Ever since I\u00a0was a young child, I felt this lingering pain and disappointment, this anger that what is going on is so stupid. But I\u00a0could never define what I felt was right without a second later feeling completely different. &quot;I would feel very angry about the Israeli politicians and people who are not doing anything, and feel very guilty. But a second later, I would feel very angry at the Palestinians who are destroying opportunities and exploding buses. But a second later, I would think, &apos;Missiles are falling on Israel, why wouldn&apos;t they attack back?&apos; These voices drove me slightly insane.&quot; Burning Star is Paldi&apos;s struggle to resolve these contradictions. Work on the show began in 2012 with six weeks of talking, as Paldi described his experiences in Israel to George Mann, his partner and co-artistic director of Theatre Ad Infinitum. Lengthy research was needed, says Paldi, because it&apos;s impossible to say anything about Israel without qualifying it with reference to several centuries of history. The 20-minute autobiographical solo piece Paldi produced as a result taught him two things. First: &quot;I can&apos;t be standing there whining about my life \u2013 as an Israeli Jew, you lead a normal life.&quot; He lived in the occupied territories as a child in the mid-1980s (his parents, he admits, took advantage of the situation economically), but spent his teenage years in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv. Even his military service passed quietly, as he taught theatre to impoverished children. And the second lesson? He wanted to\u00a0perform in drag. &quot;It gives so much freedom,&quot; he says \u2013 and it&apos;s partly the freedom of expression relished by his character, Star, that gives Burning Star its volatility: &quot;If she sees someone feels insulted, she doesn&apos;t give a fuck.&quot;     'What I wanted to communicate was the confusion' \u2026 Nir Paldi in Ballad of the Burning Star.  Photograph: Alex Brenner    It took two further rehearsal periods to hone the character of Star \u2013 who is\u00a0putting on a performance with a musician called Camp David \u2013 and her troupe of dancers, the Starlets, who wear military gear and are mercilessly persecuted by their imperious frontwoman. The show had a nine-day run in London early last year, and after each performance, Paldi held a Q&amp;A to gauge audience reactions. One night, an old German-Jewish woman confronted him. &quot;She was so upset,&quot; Paldi says. &quot;She said, &apos;My whole family died in Auschwitz.&apos;&quot; Paldi&apos;s own family moved to Israel from eastern Europe around the turn of the 20th century; his great-grandfather is one of Israel&apos;s most famous painters. &quot;It really rocked me \u2013 but it also made me feel more resolute. We have to start healing and moving on, looking at ourselves not as victims but people who are recovering. The philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz felt that the Holocaust is the Germans&apos; problem: it&apos;s so true and nobody is close to seeing this in Israel. There is so much blindness going on.&quot; Israel hasn&apos;t been the same, Paldi argues, since 1995, when prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Zionist appalled by Rabin&apos;s movement towards peace. &quot;In the show, the assassination is done in a comedic way. But it was a massive trauma for the country. There was genuine hope that things would get better and then, boom, that became despair.&quot; He still visits his family in Israel twice a year and each time he arrives he feels &quot;the repression, this bitterness in the air&quot;. And he&apos;s clear what has to happen: &quot;Stop the occupation. Even if it means buses will explode every day, it&apos;s better for us as a people.&quot; He hopes to tour Burning Star in Israel, but knows it will need a theatre to back it up. In the meantime, he&apos;s pleased the show doesn&apos;t try to resolve anything itself. &quot;I stopped wanting to articulate a specific thought or feeling \u2013 what I wanted to communicate was the confusion.&quot; That balance of argument is Burning Star&apos;s greatest strength. \u2022 Ballad of the Burning Star at Edinburgh festival: four-star review", "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T16:30:00Z", "title": "Why drag artist Nir Paldi is tackling the Israel-Palestine conflict in cabaret", "sentences": ["First: &quot;I can&apos;t be standing there whining about my life \u2013 as an Israeli Jew, you lead a normal life.&quot; He lived in the occupied territories as a child in the mid-1980s (his parents, he admits, took advantage of the situation economically), but spent his teenage years in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/18/how-israeli-drag-queen-nir-paldi"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Saudi Arabia", "Oman", "Kuwait", "United Arab Emirates"], "article": "There has been much talk this month about subtle Iranian-Israeli overtures, sparking speculations in policy circles about the possibility of a thaw in relations between Tehran and Tel Aviv. While these speculations are premature and flirt with wishful thinking, it makes geostrategic sense for the two adversaries to set aside their mutual hostility to address common concerns in the Middle East. It all began in Abu Dhabi in mid-January at the International Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s annual assembly, which included delegations from Iran and Israel led by their respective energy ministers. While Arab states that regularly, if unofficially, interact with Israel such as Kuwait boycotted the assembly due to their official Israeli non-recognition, Iran attended, and energy minister Hamid Chitchian even remained at the table when his Israeli counterpart, Silvan Shalom, spoke. As Middle Eastern affairs expert Meir Javedanfar noted, \u201cNo Iranian delegate would dare take such a risk without clearance from the very top.\u201d The favour may have been returned at the Munich security conference in early February when Israel\u2019s defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon, remained in his seat to listen to foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran. This was in stark contrast to the United Nations general assembly last September, when the Iranian and Israeli delegations boycotted each other\u2019s speeches. The day after the security meeting ended, Zarif gave an interview to a German broadcaster in which he acknowledged the Holocaust and described it as a \u201chorrifying tragedy.\u201d (President Hassan Rouhani had similarly condemned the Nazi genocide of European Jews while in New York for the general assembly.) Zarif added that if the Palestinian-Israeli issue were to be resolved, Iran would consider recognising Israel. Apparently under pressure from hardliners back home, he later claimed that his comments had been distorted. These gestures come as Iran has been redefining its international image after years of incendiary anti-Israeli rhetoric from the Ahmadinejad administration. In September, Rouhani and Zarif wished Jews around the world a happy Rosh Hashanah, and earlier this month the Iranian government made a gift worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to a Jewish hospital in Tehran. An Iranian-Israeli rapprochement is not unprecedented. During the shah\u2019s reign, the two countries enjoyed a geostrategic working relationship involving intelligence and security cooperation, an energy alliance \u2013 including the Israeli import of Iranian oil \u2013 and common positions on the threats posed by the Soviet Union and pan-Arabism. Hard as it is to imagine, revolutionary Iran continued to cooperate with Israel during much of the 1980s and 1990s despite the mutually bellicose rhetoric out of Tehran and Tel Aviv. Israel supported the Islamic republic with arms during its war with Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. In the late 1990s, a group of Israeli agricultural experts reportedly visited Iran for a secret meeting with its deputy minister of agriculture. Around this time, the two countries also allegedly began to renegotiate Israel\u2019s $1 billion debt to Iran. Tehran even allowed Israeli experts to visit areas damaged by the 2003 earthquake in Bam, as much of the infrastructure there was built by Israeli firms before the Islamic revolution. Clearly, there is a track record of Iranian-Israeli cooperation regardless of the politics and rhetoric that have weighed against it. Although Binyamin Netanyahu has been vociferous in addressing the perceived Iranian threat to Israel, during his first term as prime minister in the late 1990s he evidently sent signals that he was interested in dialogue with Tehran. Likewise, in 2003, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved an intended grand bargain with the US \u2013 rebuffed by the Bush administration \u2013 under which Iran would have recognised a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. The geostrategic setting in the Middle East is once again favourable to an Iranian-Israeli rapprochement, whether overt or sub rosa. In contrast, the turmoil in Syria and the proxy battle with Saudi Arabia highlights the deep enmity between Tehran and its longstanding rival, Riyadh. This has been highlighted by former US ambassador Frederic Hof, who recently revealed that Iranian officials told him that Iran was not in conflict with the United States or Israel but rather sees Saudi Arabia as its main adversary. Tehran has thus been seeking to counter Saudi influence in the region by repairing relationships that have deteriorated over the years, such as the one with Turkey, which feels similarly threatened by growing regional sectarianism. Also working to repair its ties with the United Arab Emirates, Iran is purportedly negotiating a solution to long-running disputes over a group of small islands in the Persian Gulf. Compounded by Iran\u2019s already close ties with Iraq and Oman, Saudi Arabia is being diplomatically out maneuvered and encircled by the Islamic republic. Even the November nuclear deal in Geneva with the so-called P5+1 can be seen as enhancing Iran\u2019s regional status to the detriment of Saudi Arabia, which has threatened to distance itself from the United States over the apparent Washington-Tehran thaw. By reestablishing strategic cooperation with Israel, Iran can refocus its attention closer to home without fearing imminent Israeli military action and can carve away at the sole major issue bridging Israel and Saudi Arabia, the perceived Iranian threat. As I have argued previously, Saudi Arabia and Israel have less in common than do Iran and Israel, which share much in the way of culture and history, and are linked through Iranian-Israeli Jewry. In fact, Iran is home to the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside Israel and there are believed to be more 200,000 Iranian Jews presently living in Israel. In Israel\u2019s case, it can benefit from cooperation with Iran, particularly as the region is under threat of growing extremism by fundamentalist Wahhabi fighters who despise Shiites and Jews alike. Furthermore, a d\u00e9tente with Tehran would likely remove the threat posed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, which acts as a deterrent against possible Israeli military action on Iran, much like Israel\u2019s nuclear submarines act as a deterrent against Iran in the Persian Gulf. It could also positively affect Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and hedge against threats by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian territories. Iran and Israel must seize the current opportunity, look beyond their political differences and let their national interests guide them to deal together with shared regional concerns. The two have cooperated in the past, and the time is right for them to do so once again.

She then spent two years in Theresienstadt (Terez\u00edn) concentration camp, where nearly 35,000 prisoners perished.

Her formal musical education began at five and she was soon taking piano lessons with Conrad Ansorge, a pupil of Franz Liszt. She met her husband to be, Leopold Sommer, was also a musician, in 1931 and married him two weeks later. The couple and their son, Raphael, were sent from Prague in 1943 to a camp in the Czech city of Terez\u00edn (Theresienstadt in German) where inmates were allowed to stage concerts in which she frequently starred. She never saw her husband again after he was moved to Auschwitz in 1944 and many in her extended family and most of the friends she had grown up with were also lost in the Holocaust.           Following the war, she went to Israel in 1949 with her sisters and taught music in Tel Aviv before moving to London at the prompting of her son, who had grown up to become a concert cellist but who died suddenly in 2001 while on tour. In a 2006 interview with the Guardian \u2013 when she was living alone, continuing to practice the piano for three hours a day and had also only recently given up a daily swimming routine \u2013 she spoke of her love of life and her passion for music. Of her concentration camp ordeal, she said: &quot; &apos;People ask, &apos;How could you make music?&apos; We were so weak. But music was special, like a spell, I would say. I gave more than 150 concerts there. There were excellent musicians there, really excellent. Violinists, cellists, singers, conductors and composers.&quot;     Alice and her son, Raphael. Photograph: Droemer    Asked if she ever thought about why she survived, she replied: &quot;My temperament. This optimism and this discipline. Punctually, at 10am, I am sitting there at the piano, with everything in order around me. For 30 years I have eaten the same, fish or chicken. Good soup, and this is all. I don&apos;t drink, not tea, not coffee, not alcohol. Hot water. I walk a lot with terrible pains, but after 20 minutes it is much better. Sitting or lying is not good.&quot; She added: &quot;I am looking for the nice things in life.

Within its maze of cobblestone streets are buildings that once housed mosques, churches and synagogues, hinting at the varied cultures that once called this medieval city home. Earlier this month, about 50 miles away from Toledo, the Spanish government sought to strengthen its ties with one of these cultures, announcing plans to fast-track the naturalisation of Sephardic Jews, whose ancestors were expelled five centuries ago from Spain. The bill, said the Spanish government, would &quot;correct a historical wrong&quot;. The legislation has yet to be approved by parliament, but already consulates in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem said they have been flooded with requests for information. Up to 3.5 million people around the world are thought to have Sephardic \u2013 Hebrew for &quot;Spanish&quot; \u2013 Jewish ancestry. Now the descendants of another group who figured prominently in Spain&apos;s colourful past \u2013 before also being expelled \u2013 say it&apos;s only fair that the same right of return be extended to them. Shortly after banishing the country&apos;s Jewish population, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand turned their attention to Spain&apos;s Muslims, forcing them to covert to Christianity or face expulsion. The Muslims who converted, known as Moriscos, often did so in name only, holding on tightly to their customs and traditions. In the early 1600s \u2013 nearly 120 years after Jews in Spain were told to leave \u2013 the Moriscos were also expelled. An estimated 275,000 people were forcibly resettled, the majority of them heading to Morocco, some to Algeria and Tunisia. A group representing Moriscos in Morocco recently sent a letter to Spain&apos;s King Juan Carlos asking the country to make the same conciliatory gesture to the descendants of Muslims. Speaking from Rabat, the president of L&apos;Association pour la M\u00e9moire des Andalous strongly criticised Spain&apos;s double standard in offering to naturalise the descendants of Jews ousted from Spain but not Muslims. The Spanish government &quot;should grant the same rights to all those who were expelled&quot;, Najib Loubaris told news agency EFE. &quot;Otherwise the decision is selective, not to mention racist.&quot; The Spanish government&apos;s offer to Sephardic Jews was &quot;very positive&quot;, said Loubaris, in that it showed an acknowledgment of &quot;guilt for the expulsion that the Spanish state committed against its own citizens&quot;. Loubaris estimated that 600 families in Morocco can trace their origins to Spain. Most no longer speak Castilian Spanish, he said, but their connection to Spain is evident in their music, architectural styles and gastronomy. In Spain, the Junta Isl\u00e1mica reinforced the vivid links between the expelled Muslims and Spain. To this day, across the country there are families &quot;who can demonstrate their lineages, who can show that their relatives were expelled hundreds of years ago,&quot; said Muhammad Escudero Uribe. Whether it is citizenship for Muslims or Jewish descendants, he said, &quot;the cause and historical background is the same. And for this we want this same right to be extended. From a legal standpoint, it&apos;s only just.&quot; His organisation has spent years lobbying the Spanish government to naturalise the descendants of Muslims. In 2006, a left-wing party in the autonomous region of Andalusia proposed a bill that would recognise the rights of Muslims who were expelled. The bill never made it to a vote. &quot;It doesn&apos;t seem that the government shares our position,&quot; lamented Escudero Uribe. The push for citizenship rights is just one part of a larger campaign being waged to raise awareness of Islamic influence in Spain, said Antonio Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, a law professor at the University of C\u00f3rdoba. &quot;We&apos;re the only place in Europe that has estranged itself from its past,&quot; he said. The right of return for those with Spanish Muslim ancestry would be &quot;symbolic rather than practical,&quot; he said. While Sephardic Jews may be able to provide proof of their lineage through their surnames, their language or through certification from the federation of Jewish communities in Spain, setting similar criteria for the descendants of Spanish Muslims would be nearly impossible. &quot;But the gesture would go a long way in repairing centuries of forgetting.&quot; Since the Spanish government&apos;s announcement, columnists around the world have mused on what prompted Spain to reach out to Sephardic Jews. Michael Freund, writing in The Jerusalem Post, called the decision &quot;decidedly ironic&quot;. He explained, &quot;the expulsion happened in part because Spain wanted Jews&apos; assets, and now they are welcoming Jews back for the same reason&quot;. Others, such as the Portuguese lawmaker who drafted a law similar to Spain&apos;s that will eventually allow Jews expelled from Portugal five centuries ago to return, insisted that the experiences of Muslims and Jews on the peninsula couldn&apos;t be compared. &quot;Persecution of Jews was just that, while what happened with the Arabs was part of a conflict,&quot; Jos\u00e9 Ribeiro e Castro told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Antonio Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Ramos suggested another reason. The hundreds of thousands of Muslims who left in the early 1600s couldn&apos;t possibly have been the only Muslim descendants in the country, he insisted. &quot;The majority of these people didn&apos;t leave when they were expelled,&quot; he argued. &quot;They stayed and they created a culture that can be described as most authentic and most Hispanic.&quot; Extending the right of return to the descendants of Spanish Muslims would shine a spotlight on a truth that most in Spain would like to ignore, he argued. &quot;The danger is that we will have to recognise that the majority of the Spanish population is of Muslim descent,&quot; said Rodr\u00edguez Ramos. &quot;It&apos;s an effort to hide our history, to hide our memory.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2014 to correct a misspelling of the word Granada in the picture caption. Muslim Influence in modern-day Spain \u2022 The Moors introduced a variety of new crops to the Iberian peninsula including oranges, lemons, cotton and sugarcane.

Moorish architecture is defined by slender columns, horseshoe arches, serene courtyards and geometric patterns. \u2022 The tangled, narrow street plans seen in many southern Spanish towns date back to Moorish times. \u2022 The guitar, along with flamenco&apos;s signature cry of ol\u00e9, are believed to be derived from early versions of the instruments brought by the Muslims to Spain.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-24T16:40:39Z", "title": "If Spain welcomes back its Jews, will its Muslims be next?", "sentences": ["The legislation has yet to be approved by parliament, but already consulates in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem said they have been flooded with requests for information."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/24/spain-sephardic-jews-islam-muslim"}, {"tags": ["Australian politics", "Australia news", "Iraq", "Iraq war inquiry"], "article": "Years after America officially withdrew from the country it invaded in 2003, Iraq remains in chaos. The issue is largely ignored in the press these days, except for the occasional horrific tale of carnage. Nobody senior in the western world has found themselves in the dock defending their justifications for the war. While examining the lack of legal oversight, the lack of planning or concern for the aftermath of the inevitable fall of Saddam Hussein, and the lack of parliamentary scrutiny preceding what amounted to a US war of aggression, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the viability of making a peaceful, citizen\u2019s arrest on former Australian prime minister John Howard for his central role in this story. This idea has a clear and principled pedigree. In 2010, Guardian columnist George Monbiot initiated the ArrestBlair.org campaign for the purpose of rewarding anybody who made a peaceful citizen\u2019s arrest of the former British leader. Blair was accused of \u201ccrimes against peace\u201d and the crime of aggression. Because the political and media elites continue to insulate Blair and his colleagues from legal culpability over the Iraq war, alternative methods were required. To this day, Iraqis are enduring insecurity, violence, kidnapping, sexual violence, extremism and terrorism. The legacy of the conflict is absolutely devastating. And yet the politicians who took America, Britain and Australia into the conflict work and play openly. Howard, who led Australia into Iraq in 2003, remains a free man, lecturing around the world. He was given an award at Tel Aviv University this year for his \u201cunwavering, courageous advocacy of the state of Israel spanning decades\u201d, is often quoted in the media, and gave a talk at Sydney\u2019s Lowy Institute in 2013 defending the morality of removing Hussein from power. No apologies, no mea culpas and no serious questions followed. The vast bulk of the political elite prefers to ignore what transpired in 2003, and there are no serious calls to hold Howard accountable for alleged breaches of international law in joining George W Bush\u2019s operation (Campaign for an Iraq War Inquiry is a notable exception). In Britain, the Downing Street memo revealed the illegality of the war without a UN resolution. In Australia Howard\u2019s government, according to countless interviews with insiders at the time, had no interest in gaining advice about the legality of the enterprise. Blindly supporting the US alliance, and a desire to crush a former American ally, was paramount. Then defence department head Ric Smith has said that he \u201cwas not aware of any senior official advising against it [going into Iraq] in my time .\u201d In reality, John Howard ministers took no advice before joining the war. The head of the department of prime minister and cabinet, Peter Shergold, told journalist Paul Kelly in his 2009 book The March of the Patriots that \u201cit would be wrong to think they [Howard and then foreign minister Alexander Downer] were not interested in advice but the advice they wanted ... was about the conduct of the war and capabilities, not the decision to go to war.\u201d Britain\u2019s Chilcot inquiry, yet to release its report amidst accusations of political interference, heard in 2010 that every senior legal advisor at the Foreign Office before the war concluded that it breached international law. Despite these damning facts, Blair and his foreign secretary Jack Straw are seemingly immune from prosecution or even serious investigation. This is where the power of the people becomes vital, if for only symbolic reasons, to highlight the institutional failure of our nominally democratic system to hold the highest office bearers to account. International law must apply to all. This January, Monbiot praised the latest individual who confronted Blair, at a restaurant in London, and wrote that:  It has already succeeded in doing two things: keeping the issue \u2013 and the memories of those who have been killed \u2013 alive, and sustaining the pressure to ensure that international law binds the powerful as well as the puny.  The evidence against Howard is long and detailed. He has continued to claim it was \u201cnear universal\u201d that Saddam had WMDs and Iraq was therefore a threat to the world. In fact, countless officials, insiders, weapons inspectors and secret services questioned the accuracy of these \u201cslam dunk\u201d assessments. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 told Blair in 2002 that \u201cthe intelligence and facts are being fixed around the policy.\u201d In Australia, senior intelligence officer Andrew Wilkie resigned in 2003 over his claims that Howard was abusing intelligence reports over Iraq. No independent legal advice was sought, and therefore the party cabinet decision on war was not a transparent process .  Even former Howard government minister, Nick Minchin, admitted in 2010 that he regretted Australia was \u201cnot able to be more successful in persuading the Bush administration to remain focused on Afghanistan rather than in opening up another front in Iraq.\u201d Minchin argued that he \u201cknew that the decision [to invade Iraq] having been made, Australia had to support it.\u201d There was no mention of legal advice supporting Canberra\u2019s entry into the conflict.  Margaret Swieringa, a senior Australian public servant who worked as a secretary to the federal parliamentary intelligence committee from 2002 until 2007, wrote in 2013 that Howard\u2019s use of intelligence reports was fundamentally flawed. She knew, as an insider, that, \u201cnone of the government\u2019s arguments [of Iraq\u2019s apparent immediate threat] were supported by the intelligence presented to it by its own agencies. None of these arguments were true.\u201d A campaign to hold Howard to account wouldn\u2019t be a stunt. It would be a serious attempt to keep the most devastating war in a generation in the public arena by reminding those most implicated that there is a price to be paid if such actions are ever repeated again.  A full public inquiry into the Iraq war, including the war powers used by Howard to take Australia into a conflict opposed by a great number of Australian people, is required.

The song did not come easy. Banging his head in frustration on a hotel-room floor, Leonard Cohen ground out about 80 stanzas before finally achieving the perfect anthem that is &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. And no one got it. CBS Records rejected the album. After a 1984 indie release, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; hung in limbo for a decade until Jeff\u00a0Buckley, sighing deeply over a\u00a0steel\u00a0guitar, gave a soft, introspective reinterpretation. Buckley&apos;s death by drowning in 1997 added a tragic aura to\u00a0the song. The producers of Shrek called in Rufus Wainwright to record it\u00a0for the soundtrack. Cohen, having been fleeced by a felonious manager, went back on the road, singing &quot;Hallelujah&quot; in a trademark brown hat. X Factor hopefuls heard it\u00a0and one belted it out to victory. Suddenly, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was being downloaded 100,000 times a day and turning into the most covered pop song of the 21st\u00a0century.            Amid the resurrective clamour, few grasped the leap that Cohen had made into the past. In the depths of despair, he had sought the &quot;secret chord / That\u00a0David played, and it pleased the Lord&quot; across three millennia of human creation, appealing as one lost Jew to an ancestor for the primal gift of music. I think I know where he was coming from. Growing up in a devout and learned north London home, I became aware of the taboos and tensions that prevailed between Jews and music. I\u00a0learned, for instance, that Jews, mourning the destruction of their temple in 70AD, were forbidden by rabbis to sing or play music, all the way\u00a0down to Moses Maimonides in the\u00a012th century. I knew, too, that a woman&apos;s voice was\u00a0proscribed by the Talmud as &quot;nakedness&quot; and that hearing a\u00a0woman sing was equivalent to having an illicit sexual liaison. Thrilling as that may have seemed to my boyish mind, women&apos;s singing really was taboo. As\u00a0was listening to music for seven and\u00a0a\u00a0half dark weeks of the year and at times of personal loss. In sorrow, music was the first thing to be switched off. Yet, amid these constraints, music was everywhere. At any solemnity or\u00a0celebration, someone would start a\u00a0tune. There would be singing at all Sabbath meals. Since my father was tone deaf, it was my grownup sisters who floated the melodies that I, at three or four years old, learned to harmonise by ear. Music was our means\u00a0of togetherness. Without music, I\u00a0remember thinking, would we even be Jewish? So when Radio 3 commissioned me to make a three-part series about music and the Jews, I made the decision to avoid popular cliches of &quot;Jewish music&quot; \u2013 klezmer bands, cantorial wails, Ladino lullabies \u2013 and focus on some of the bigger questions. How, for instance, has music shaped the character and history of the Jews? How did Jews influence music? Biggest of all, can music define personal and collective identity? I started where Cohen did, in search of the elusive King David: poet, musician, warrior, sexual malefactor and author of a book of psalms that forms the basis of worship for Jews and\u00a0Christians alike. Though there isn&apos;t \u00a0much evidence that David wrote\u00a0all or\u00a0any of\u00a0the 71 psalms that bear his\u00a0name, we cannot read them today\u00a0without becoming aware of this musician&apos;s private world, his inner ear. Walking on the ramparts of Jerusalem, Yehoshua Engelman, a\u00a0London-born rabbi turned psychotherapist, and I discuss Psalm 51, the one about sex with Bathsheba, the one where Cohen sings: &quot;Your faith was strong but you needed proof / You saw her bathing on the roof / Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.&quot; How could David, having sent a man to his death so he could steal his wife, sit down and write &quot;Hallelujah&quot;? &quot;With great difficulty,&quot; explains Yehoshua. &quot;The Talmud tells us that David was punished for his sin.&quot; &quot;How&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;He was deprived of his music for 10\u00a0years.&quot; Time stops still on the wall of David&apos;s city. Yehoshua&apos;s reading of Psalm 51 is\u00a0that David was rendered musically, and\u00a0perhaps sexually, impotent by guilt, an idea that does not exist until Freud adduces it in 20th-century Vienna. Could Jewish guilt be rooted in\u00a0Jewish music? American composer Steve Reich came to Jerusalem in the 1970s in search of his Jewish roots. His epiphany arrived while listening to the way Yemenites enunciate the Psalms. &quot;I just had to chant a verse [with them],&quot; he recalls, &quot;and a melody popped into my head. What is that? It was an unconscious dredging up of Bulgarian rhythms from\u00a0B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, changing rhythms in\u00a0The Rite of Spring, all unbidden. But\u00a0it introduced a new kind of rhythmic writing for me, a specific idea\u00a0of combining twos and threes into\u00a0five/eights, seven/eights; something I hadn&apos;t done before.&quot; Reich considers his psalmic score, Tehillim, to be his towering masterpiece.            Tehillim were the songs of the temple. The search for their lost music is a bimillennial obsession. In 1905, a\u00a0cantor called Abraham Zvi Idelsohn arrived in Jerusalem from South Africa and, like Bart\u00f3k in the Balkans, began recording old men&apos;s songs on wire machines. Applying new techniques of\u00a0academic musicology, he surmised that the Jews of Yemen came closest to temple music. At the National Sound Archive in Jerusalem, I played Idelsohn&apos;s cylinders and consider his boldest conclusion \u2013 that Yemenite-Jewish microtones lie at the root of Gregorian chant, and hence of all Christian music. The creative potential of this source remains limitless. The music of modern Israel is driven by Yemenite singers \u2013 Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Ofra Haza and Achinoam Nini, known as Noa. All are women, therefore silenced by Judaism and Islam. &quot;I am Yemenite and I am Jewish,&quot; declares Noa, who sang on the Eurovision song contest with a Palestinian, Mira Awad. &quot;You find a way to work around the restrictions and that gives you a lot of strength and develops your creativity to amazing heights.&quot; In a Tel Aviv apartment, I meet the\u00a0anthropologist Tova Gamliel, an\u00a0authority on mourning, and ask her\u00a0to\u00a0demonstrate the oldest known Jewish sound \u2013 the keening of Yemenite women. Gamliel stands, composes herself and sings a visceral, chilling trope that freezes my fingers to\u00a0the chair. &quot;The role,&quot; she explains, &quot;is to make people cry, to express sorrow in a very aesthetic performance. But the song has a text \u2013 the life of the\u00a0departed \u2013 and the singer can vary\u00a0that\u00a0according to what the person deserves, good or bad. She is telling the\u00a0others: when you die, I may not be\u00a0so generous.&quot; The power of life after death was vested in a woman. &quot;She was the only one who had this right. People were very afraid of her, very respectful,&quot; says\u00a0Gamliel. When the keening ends, the woman recomposes herself, then tells a joke. Life must go on. Myriam Fuks from Brussels is an eighth-generation Yiddish singer whose repertoire has passed from mother to\u00a0daughter for two centuries. Myriam&apos;s mother, Frania, sang in Warsaw theatres, survived the Warsaw ghetto. Myriam wakes in the morning with fragments of Frania&apos;s hundreds of songs. Unable to remember the refrain, she asks the pianist Martha Argerich to\u00a0improvise for her on a new recording. The need to keep memory alive by song, I discover, a driving Jewish motivation. It was the late 1820s before Jews were allowed into western music. There had been isolated intrusions \u2013 Salomone Rossi in Monteverdi&apos;s Mantua, Lorenzo da Ponte in Mozart&apos;s Vienna \u2013 but it took a pair of bankers&apos; sons from Berlin, Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, to change the\u00a0culture. Mendelssohn, aside from his own concert works, restored Bach&apos;s oratorios to public performance \u2013 &quot;giving classical music its Old Testament&quot;, according to one of my contributors. Meyerbeer blew out the walls of existing opera houses with gargantuan music dramas, paving the way for Richard Wagner and the romantic imagination.            Wagner, in a notorious 1850 pamphlet, &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (&quot;Judaism in Music&quot;), named Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer as symptoms of the Jews&apos; &quot;infinitely small&quot; ability to write music. He demanded the exclusion of Jews from German music, a blueprint for Hitler&apos;s ethnic cleansing. Like most bigots, Wagner lived in fear of the other, the unknown, the unimagined. At the end of his century Arnold Schoenberg, exasperated to his Jewish core by the tonal corsets of German music, ripped them off in two creative revolutions, atonal and serial. Orchestral music would never sound the same again. Around the same time, on the front stoops of New York brownstones, the sons of Jewish refugees from Russian pogroms and of former African-Caribbean slaves from the deep south found an unsuspected common taste for busy rhythms, minor keys and\u00a0blue notes. Their conversation signalled the birth of pop music. How Jewish was that? George Gershwin, the most restless and creative of the early writers, never concealed his Jewish roots. When he sang &quot;It Ain&apos;t Necessarily So&quot;, he not only challenged Scripture with Talmudic argument, he actually sang it\u00a0in the traditional mode of Talmudic study. Visiting the Yiddish theatre star grandparents of the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, Gershwin talked of the freygish mode as the key to America&apos;s popular music. Freygish is Yiddish for questioning. What Jews added to pop music was a quizzical note. Michael Grade, heir to an entertainment dynasty and ex-chair of the BBC, explains why Jews were so big in showbiz. &quot;There&apos;s something in the DNA of the Jews that makes us adept at\u00a0assimilating,&quot; he explains. &quot;There&apos;s a\u00a0great openness to what&apos;s going on. We are watching the audience, trying to keep in touch with what the audience wants. The best of the impresarios \u2013 I&apos;d\u00a0include my uncles and my late father \u2013 would be just ahead, not too far ahead, of public taste. And ready to take a chance on talent. Things are never the same again after the great talent has spoken.&quot; Jews became tastemakers, Grade believes, because they had learned to listen out for any change in the wind. A\u00a0key to survival became a\u00a0tool in identifying and managing public taste without sacrificing a hardwon identity.            Schoenberg&apos;s last words on a sheet of music paper were: &quot;Ich bin ein kleiner Judenbub.&quot; (I am a little Jewish boy.) Gustav Mahler used to\u00a0say: &quot;A\u00a0Jew\u00a0is like a swimmer with a\u00a0short arm. He has to work harder to\u00a0reach shore.&quot; Jews made music out of an awareness of their Jewishness. That perspective makes a generic concept of &quot;Jewish music&quot; uninteresting and largely irrelevant beside the transformations that Jews brought to music wherever they lived, and the changes that music wrought in the matter of being Jewish. Could anyone, I have always wondered, be Jewish without music? &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter which you heard,&quot; sings Leonard Cohen, &quot;the holy, or the broken.&quot; Hallelujah! \u2022 Music and the Jews begins on Radio 3 on 9 March.", "publicationDate": "2014-03-01T09:30:00Z", "title": "'Without music, would we even be Jewish?'", "sentences": ["&quot;You find a way to work around the restrictions and that gives you a lot of strength and develops your creativity to amazing heights.&quot; In a Tel Aviv apartment, I meet the\u00a0anthropologist Tova Gamliel, an\u00a0authority on mourning, and ask her\u00a0to\u00a0demonstrate the oldest known Jewish sound \u2013 the keening of Yemenite women."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/01/without-music-would-jews-be-jewish"}, {"tags": ["Zinedine Zidane", "France", "Football", "Spain", "Sport", "Real Madrid", "Pel\u00e9", "Kenny Dalglish", "Barcelona", "World Cup"], "article": "When Fabio Capello was the England manager he often talked about the way the national shirt hung heavily on the shoulders of his players.

They may have been global superstars with Champions League medals and millions in the bank but when it came to playing for their country, they were intimidated by the sight of three lions on a shirt. The burden of expectations can weigh down the best of us, so spare a thought for Enzo Alan Zidane Fern\u00e1ndez. The young midfielder will train with France&apos;s Under-19s for the first time this week. The team&apos;s manager, Wily Sagnol, said: &quot;We&apos;re all somebody&apos;s son, there won&apos;t be any more expectation on him,&quot; but the 18-year-old is set to make his debut in a training match behind closed doors on Tuesday night while contending with the six most iconic letters in the country&apos;s sporting history: ZIDANE. Those three consonants and three vowels add up to the greatest player of his era: the man who volleyed in the most majestic goal ever scored in a Champions League final; the three-time world player of the year who won the scudetto with Juventus, La Liga with Real Madrid and the World Cup and European Championship with France. To Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano he was &quot;a walking spectacle who plays as if he had silk gloves on each foot&quot;; to art-house film directors he was a leading man who could carry a whole movie; and to the people of France he was their goalscorer in two World Cup finals. But to young Fern\u00e1ndez, he is a father, a coach at Real Madrid and the reason his name has been known his whole life. Enzo has opted to play under his mother&apos;s maiden name but whether he likes it or not, his father has made him famous. Their family kickabouts in the Zidane back garden have been watched by over two million people online. The skills he showed as a 12-year-old against Barcelona&apos;s youth team have excited a generation of expectant Real Madrid fans. When he was called up to the Real Madrid first-team squad as a 16-year-old by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho it made front page news. When he scores a spectacular goal in a youth match \u2013 or loses his temper and is sent off \u2013 the story is recounted around the world, because of his famous name. When Didier Deschamps held a press conference last week to discuss France&apos;s upcoming friendly against Holland, he was asked about Enzo. The France manager won the World Cup with Zidane when Enzo was a toddler, but he would not be drawn on the subject: &quot;Leave him alone, this is all he needs. His name is hard to carry. He&apos;s just a player with a well-known name. It&apos;s never easy, and it&apos;s even less easy with his name. He won&apos;t live his father&apos;s history and I think Zizou will agree with me. Zizou lived his life, had his career. Enzo will have his own.&quot; Enzo will have his own life, but it may not endure like his father&apos;s. Jordi Cruyff, who spent the bulk of his career at Barcelona and Manchester United without ever settling on what name to put on the back of his shirt, knew all about being less than extraordinary. &quot;There are two types of football players,&quot; he reflected. &quot;The legends and the mortals. My father is a legend and I am a mortal. The legends like my father; they come, they do and they remain. I am part of the vast majority of mortals; we come, we do and we die.&quot; Cruyff won the Premier League and played for Holland. In most families that would measure up fairly well, but it just so happens his dad was &quot;Pythagoras in boots&quot;. To his credit, Jordi seems to have accepted his lot: &quot;It was more the media who were dreaming that my genes would be identical to my father&apos;s. To my pain, it was never like this.&quot; He is now a sporting director in Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv, who won their first title in a decade last season. Paul Dalglish has also moved abroad to find some success. Having grown up but never truly settled at Celtic, Liverpool and Newcastle, Paul spent some time drifting through the Football League before setting off for the US, where he is now coaching with the MLS club Real Salt Lake. &quot;I can&apos;t go anywhere without people saying: &apos;You&apos;ll never be as good as your dad,&apos;&quot; he said of his time in England. &quot;Growing up with the surname on your back, you were never really judged on what you could do. You were judged on what you could do compared to what your dad had done. Coming to America, where the knowledge of what he had done wasn&apos;t the same, allowed me to be judged on what I could do. It was enticing to be able to carve out a reputation for myself. It&apos;s the best decision I&apos;ve ever made.&quot; Pel\u00e9&apos;s elder son, Edinho, has also found some peace in coaching. The former Santos goalkeeper had an unremarkable career in the game but after being convicted of murder and arrested for his part in a drug-trafficking operation, he seems to have found a home again at Santos. He was appointed as their goalkeeping coach in 2007 and has since been promoted to the role of assistant manager. Edinho is now wise enough to admit that he and his father made mistakes: &quot;We do not choose our parents. If it was not the ideal father in my youth, he regained it all when he stood by me and went through it all with me. I have to be aware that 24 hours a day I&apos;m always a potential target, and that at any moment I can be used.&quot; Edinho knows the pitfalls of being a famous son and is well placed to help his younger brother, Joshua Nascimento, who plays for the Santos youth team. Joshua plays up front but has decided against adopting his father&apos;s shirt number: &quot;As I am a striker, I prefer to wear No9 or 11. Maybe one day I&apos;ll wear 10, that will be big. It will increase the responsibility. I&apos;ll have to handle it the best possible way. The comparisons will happen, but I have to block them. Pel\u00e9 was Pel\u00e9, and I am me.&quot; It all sounds a little drab for young Enzo, but he can take heart from the story of the Forl\u00e1ns of Montevideo, a family who have led Uruguay to international trophies across three generations. When Diego Forl\u00e1n helped win the Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2011 he emulated the achievements of his father, Pablo Forl\u00e1n, and his grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazo. Forl\u00e1n scored two goals in the final against Paraguay, then lifted the trophy and announced: &quot;Three generations have won this trophy. My grandfather won it, my father won it, and now I have also done it. The name of Forl\u00e1n will stay in history.&quot; Who knows, maybe the name of Fern\u00e1ndez will stay in history, nestling up to the name of Zidane.", "publicationDate": "2014-03-04T14:17:28Z", "title": "Will Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez emulate his famous father, Zinedine Zidane? | Paul Campbell", "sentences": ["To his credit, Jordi seems to have accepted his lot: &quot;It was more the media who were dreaming that my genes would be identical to my father&apos;s.

But Netanyahu re-iterated his calls for a full recognition of Israeli sovereign rights and a lasting security presence. \u201cIt is time the Palestinians stopped denying history,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to recognise the Jewish state \u2013 no excuses, no delays.\u201d \u201cIf this peace is to be more than just a brief interlude, Israel needs security arrangements. We shall always hope for the best, but in the Middle East we have to be prepared for the worst. This position may not win me universal praise but I am charged with protecting the security of my people.\u201d The trip has left many in Washington fearing that the elusive peace deal is as far away as ever and brought an equally chilly response from Palestinian leaders. Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi told The Associated Press that the Israeli leader went to Washington \u201cready to allocate blame without, in any way, showing any sign of willingness to do the right thing \u2013 to stop settlement activities, accept \u201867 borders, accept signed agreements, end illegal actions and move ahead. Instead, he is reiterating his ideological condition of recognition of a Jewish state.\u201d Netanyahu also repeated his scathing criticism of US and European nuclear negotiations with Iran, contrasting its support for killing in Syria with Israel\u2019s offer of medical facilities to wounded civilians. \u201cIn a Middle East saturated by butcherism and barbarism, Israel is a force for good. The border is a dividing line between decency and depravity,\u201d said Netanyahu. \u201cThe only thing that Iran sends abroad are rockets and terrorists,\u201d he added, calling Iran a \u201cbrutal theocracy\u201d that represses millions and whose \u201csoothing words do not square with aggressive actions\u201d. \u201cThe greatest threat to our common security is a nuclear armed Iran,\u201d concluded Netanyahu. \u201cWe must prevent them from having the capability to make weapons.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-03-04T20:11:14Z", "title": "Netanyahu says he is prepared to make 'a historic peace' with Palestinians", "sentences": ["\u201cLike New York and Tel Aviv, John Kerry is the Secretary of State who never sleeps,\u201d joked Netanyahu."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/netanyahu-aipac-prepared-historic-peace-with-palestinian-leaders"}, {"tags": ["Adelaide festival 2014", "Australia news", "Classical music", "Electronic music", "Jazz"], "article": "What do you get when you cross the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra with Sunn O)))? Over the next couple of days, music fans at the Adelaide festival are going to find out, when Ilan Volkov\u2019s Tectonics project hits the city.  It will be the fifth time Tectonics has been staged since its inaugural performance in Reykjavic 2012 (it\u2019s also been to Glasgow and Tel-Aviv). The idea behind the festival is to collide two opposing forces (like tectonic plates) \u2013 experimental music performers and a traditional orchestra \u2013 and see what kind of energy will be unleashed. Adelaide will get a programme that concentrates on Australian composers and musicians but also involves international musicians ranging from the aforementioned ambient doom metallers (playing in their Gravetemple incarnation) to Fluxus legend Takehisa Kosugi. With one of the two concerts running at nearly nine hours, the audience will get a total immersion in Volkov\u2019s vision. \u201cFor an audience it\u2019s a really powerful experience where you\u2019re confronted by very diverse things,\u201d says Volvok, \u201cand that\u2019s why the marathon aspect to it is very strong. If it was spread over three weeks it would lose this energy that it has.\u201d     Volkov rehearses with Adelaide Symphony Orchestra ahead of their Tectonics Adelaide performance, photographed in the Grainger Studio. Photograph: Alicia Canter    The idea behind the festival is easily explained by the fact that Volkov is a symphony orchestra composer (he was the youngest person ever appointed to conduct a BBC orchestra, the Glasgow Symphony) but also puts on avant garde music gigs at a Tel Aviv club he co-owns. Tectonics will express that range, including everything from solo acoustic performances to hardcore electronic improvisation. \u201cAs an audience you have a feeling of a real adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of what I chose is very physical and visceral so you really need to be in the space to hear it, to really experience what it is, and that\u2019s why the choice of composers like Scelsi feels so natural in the context of the other genres that are included in this event. The barriers are broken totally.\u201d Scelsi is Giacinto Scelsi, the 20th-century composer whose work provides one of the tentpoles of the programme, alongside that of Iannis Xenakis. Volkov chose both composers for their interest in ritual and symbol, which influenced many of the musicians elsewhere on the bill, including Gravetemple\u2019s Steven O\u2019Malley and Oren Ambarchi. There will also be a performance two works by David Ahern, a pioneering Australian composer whose work has been largely forgotten. Another piece, a collaboration between violinist and experimental music performer Jon Rose and classical composer Elena Kats-Chernin is, says Volkov, \u201ca distillation of what Tectonics is about. It\u2019s very elastic piece where both the soloist and myself, the conductor, are choosing a lot of options. We have a lot of decisions to make so it\u2019s quite free.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s this sense of freedom that makes Volkov seem so relaxed about being charge of such a complicated festival. \u201cUsually I try to schedule it so we have the maximum rehearsal time but for some pieces you don\u2019t need too much or it will kill it, so it\u2019s a matter of curating [the festival] in a wise way,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the challenges is to really open up the orchestra to new experience, for them and the audience. What was great in Glasgow was that more than 80% of the audience was new to the orchestra. In the 10 years I\u2019ve been working there, the way the musicians and audiences deal with new music has completely transformed. I\u2019m expecting a keen and interested audience and I\u2019m not dumbing it down in any way. I think most of the audience is excited about that because you can really feel it straight away when you go in.\u201d Volkov is on a mission to expand the audience for contemporary classical music, and previous editions of Tectonics have included music by John Cage to entice a crowd who would prefer to go to visual art events rather than hear contemporary music. Adelaide will take a different tack but still do its best to prize orchestral music out of any ghettos it may still inhabit. Of course, Volkov still conducts the great symphonies in the course of his day job, but says that the experience of curating Tectonic enriches his approach. \u201cI feel privileged to be able to still do the symphonies side by side with working with composers and discussing things more intimately with them. The contrast between the two makes total sense. Every time I do a modern piece it influences how I approach conducting a Brahms or Beethoven symphony. Musicians should be doing both \u2013 for me it\u2019s natural.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-03-09T01:07:32Z", "title": "Ilan Volkov: classical music's super collider", "sentences": ["Photograph: Alicia Canter    The idea behind the festival is easily explained by the fact that Volkov is a symphony orchestra composer (he was the youngest person ever appointed to conduct a BBC orchestra, the Glasgow Symphony) but also puts on avant garde music gigs at a Tel Aviv club he co-owns."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/09/ilan-volkov-classical-musics-super-collider"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "David Cameron", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Mahmoud Abbas", "Palestinian territories", "John Kerry"], "article": "When the prime minister&apos;s chartered plane lands at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on Wednesday afternoon, the reception for David Cameron and his entourage of around some 70 aides and delegates may be a little rough around the edges. Cameron&apos;s first visit to the Holy Land since taking office almost four years ago has already been cancelled once, due to last month&apos;s extensive flooding in the UK. This time, it coincides with a long-running labour dispute in Israel&apos;s foreign ministry, which means its officials and diplomats are refusing to have anything to do with the UK visit, leaving logistical arrangements to the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office and British diplomatic staff on the ground. &quot;This is an unusual situation, especially with a delegation from such an important country,&quot; said an Israeli government official. &quot;Protocol will not be followed.&quot; In keeping with the union action, the Israeli embassy in London said it could not comment on Cameron&apos;s visit. Cameron will be accompanied by about two dozen trade delegates and several representatives of his recently launched Commission on the Holocaust, as well as government officials. A string of trade announcements is expected during his 22 hours in Israel. But the heart of the visit will be an address to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, and meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and President Shimon Peres. Cameron will also meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on a much shorter visit to the West Bank on Thursday. To both sides, Cameron is expected to restate the UK&apos;s position, endorsing the peace initiative of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and warning that time is running out to implement the internationally backed two-state solution to the decades-long conflict. But his tone is likely to be notably friendly, rather than hectoring, towards Israel. Following Israel&apos;s concerns that the UK is moving towards a tougher position on settlements and settlement produce, &quot;Cameron will be aiming to bring Britain firmly into the orbit of friendly nations, although we&apos;re unlikely to see a Canadian-style love-in,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;His tone will be warm and supportive. He is coming as a friend, on the model of Obama&apos;s visit last year.&quot; However, the British leader will stress the need to seize the opportunity provided by Kerry. &quot;The timing of Cameron&apos;s visit is about the peace process,&quot; said a diplomat. &quot;There is a window open now, but potentially it closes in six weeks&apos; time.&quot; Kerry has set the end of April as the deadline for reaching a &quot;framework agreement&quot; between the two sides. Cameron is likely to reiterate Britain&apos;s long-standing opposition to settlement expansion. Some observers would like to see him go beyond the standard statement, with an uncompromising message that peace requires painful withdrawals from Israel&apos;s colonies in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and that failing to do so this will be increased international isolation, including a growing global boycott movement. (The UK government&apos;s position is that it opposes a boycott of Israel but supports clear labelling of settlement produce to allow consumers to make an informed choice.) If Kerry fails to win agreement for his framework agreement, the Palestinians are expected to renew their efforts to win recognition for their state in the international arena and to pursue the boycott strategy. They will press the UK and other European states for action to back up their words. &quot;The Palestinians are very anxious,&quot; said the diplomat. &quot;They fear that Kerry has spent too long trying to persuade the Israelis and as a result is now overly influenced by the Israeli agenda.&quot; According to this source, positions on both sides are now hardening, making it more difficult for Kerry to broker a &quot;strong, groundbreaking&quot; agreement. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of hard pounding in the weeks ahead.&quot; Iran will also be on the agenda for the Cameron-Netanyahu meetings, with the British prime minister seeking to reassure his Israeli counterpart that its concerns over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons programme will be addressed in international talks on a permanent deal. Israel was deeply unhappy with the temporary agreement reached in Geneva last year. Despite some robust statements from the UK Foreign Office, Cameron has not embraced the Israeli-Palestinian issue. &quot;Israel does not seem a priority for him,&quot; said the Israeli government official. &quot;Perhaps, rather like Obama&apos;s desire to be the &apos;un-Bush&apos;, Cameron is doing the &apos;un-Blair&apos; thing. Relations have been a little bit cooler.

The sheer scale of the suffering cries out for coverage. The UN estimates that a third of the country has been displaced. We stopped estimating the death toll after it passed a staggering 100,000. For UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), the agency that works with Palestinian refugees in the Middle East, the numbers have also been bewildering: 270,000 of our beneficiaries inside Syria have been displaced. The largest of the camps, Yarmouk in Damascus, once home to 160,000 Palestinians, has been reduced to rubble for the most part. In the face of this overwhelming emergency we have appealed to the donor community for more than $400m. Aid money follows the cameras. Cameras follow conflict. Syria is no exception. Our emergency plan for 2014 is relatively well funded so far. The bad news is that we also have emergency programmes elsewhere, where need is profound and chronic but which are suffering from serious news fatigue: Gaza and the West Bank. Gaza hit the headlines during the upsurge in fighting in the winter of 2008-2009 and then again in November 2012. For a brief few days the cameras were there to capture the Israeli attack and the rockets that flew towards Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The West Bank is even more severely &quot;news fatigued&quot;. The occupation, now more than 45 years old, is hardly a news story, some would say. UNRWA anticipates that this year&apos;s emergency work in those areas, , for which we need $300m, will receive just \u00a3120m from our mainly state donors. The consequences of this will be devastating on an individual level for our beneficiaries who already number among the most disadvantaged in the Middle East. At the macro level it is likely to have political ramifications, given that these are the populations which the current peace process needs to engage \u2013 a prospect that recedes with their continued economic disempowerment and consequent sense of desperation and isolation. In Gaza, where UNRWA serves 1.2 million of the 1.7 million population, the shortfall in the emergency programme budget may be as high as $30m, which will have a devastating impact on people already restive after nearly seven years of economic strangulation caused by the Israeli blockade and the subsequent destruction of what had been a critical lifeline for many \u2013 the trade tunnels into Egypt. UNRWA&apos;s food aid is likely to be the first casualty of our underfunded emergency programmes. In Gaza, our already suspended school feeding programme, which gives many of the quarter of a million children in our schools their first regular meal of the day, is likely to end. Moreover, we may have to end cash assistance for refugees who are still waiting for new homes following the two most recent rounds of fighting and last year&apos;s devastating floods. Wider economic trends in Gaza offer little hope. Unemployment surged to a record high of 38.5% in the last quarter of 2013, up from 27.9% in the second quarter and 32.5% in the third. Refugees being additionally vulnerable were disproportionally hit, with unemployment among refugee communities at more than 40.9% at the end of last year. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, current underfunding projections would necessitate a significant reduction in food assistance at a time when food insecurity is rising, with more and more families \u2013 especially inside refugee camps \u2013 requiring assistance to meet their basic food needs. When economic forecasts dictate that levels of need will rise, UNRWA&apos;s emergency work with the increasingly needy will likely be cut back. And make no mistake, such cuts have the potential to cause instability in an already volatile region, and in the very places where the current peace initiative needs to take hold. There was acrimony and unrest during the recent strike among UNRWA&apos;s workers in the West Bank when refugee communities saw their services withheld; there have been violent protests against service cuts around an already unstable Gaza Strip. The only way of dealing with these man-made emergencies is to get rid of the underlying causes: the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory and the closure of Gaza which is stifling the economy, increasing poverty and unemployment, and forcing even greater dependency on aid provided by the international community. The need for emergency interventions would diminish dramatically if Gaza was opened up for normal business and trade. Moreover, UNRWA&apos;s assistance has the capacity to instill a degree of calm and stability into the lives of some of the most desperate and disadvantaged communities in the Middle East. A relatively small investment now could be of lasting value and a vital peace dividend at a crucial time. Few doubt that a failure to deal with the growing sense of isolation and disempowerment among some of the most desperate communities around Israel is likely to have far-reaching political consequences.

Makati City is one of the biggest business districts in the greater Metro Manila area, and is also a central hub for politics, showbiz, restaurants and nightlife. Meaning there are so many more reasons to take selfies here. You&apos;re taking selfies as you work your ass off for that promotion. You&apos;re taking selfies to show your pride in your community. You&apos;re taking selfies when you run into local celebrities. You&apos;re taking a selfie to show your status as you mingle with the elites. You&apos;re taking selfies to show that you are a positive member of your community and family.     A goat poses for posterity at an agricultural business fair in Manila.

Twice rejected for a place at Vienna&apos;s Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste (Academy of Fine Arts), he had strident views on the nature of art and its role in society \u2013 ones he did not abandon even in the midst of the Nuremberg rallies. &quot;It is not the mission of art,&quot; the F\u00fchrer proclaimed to the assembled crowd in September 1935, &quot;to wallow in filth for filth&apos;s sake, to paint the human being only in a state of putrefaction, to draw cretins as symbols of motherhood, or to present deformed idiots as representatives of manly strength.&quot; This quotation appears on a wall of a Munich art gallery two years later, when the Nazis displayed hundreds of seized artworks they declared entartet (degenerate). Jews and communists, abstract pioneers, and especially the Expressionists of the Dresden-centered movement known as Die Br\u00fccke (The Bridge) were condemned as sick, poisonous artists in the Degenerate Art show of 1937. It was one of the most infamous exhibitions of the 20th century; it was also one of the best attended. And its effects are being felt even today \u2013 witness the contested cache of paintings hoarded by Cornelius Gurlitt, whose father sold numerous paintings in that show. Degenerate Art: The Attack on Modern Art in Nazi Germany, 1937, which opened this week at New York&apos;s Neue Galerie, reconstructs not just the Munich exhibition that destroyed so many artistic careers, but the rhetoric that made the exhibition possible. It&apos;s the first show since this museum of German and Austrian art opened in 2001 to reckon exclusively with the Nazi period, and it&apos;s a welcome step forward. The Neue Galerie has devoted solo shows to many of the artists here, from Kandinsky and Kokoschka to Otto Dix and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and usually those exhibitions trailed off at the end of the Weimar period with a brief, dutiful reminder of the horrors to come.     Paul Klee (1879-1940) The Angler, 1921 Photograph: Neue Galerie    This show pushes into the 1930s, and it features not just art deemed degenerate but also Nazi-approved painting and sculpture, party propaganda, and films such as the hideously anti-Semitic treatise Der ewige Jude (The Wandering Jew). The result is bracing, and if the exhibition is a little thin in parts \u2013 the 50 paintings exclude several major figures, such as Max Ernst and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy \u2013 the history of the works that are here makes up the difference. Attacks on art began almost immediately after Hitler&apos;s accession in 1933, often in spontaneous, private Schandausstellungen (&quot;shame exhibitions&quot;). Dix, who earned the Iron Cross as a soldier during the first world war, was a favourite target of these proto-Degenerate Art shows; his glorious grotesques such as War Cripples (1920), they claimed, were insufficiently patriotic. War Cripples was included in the later Munich exhibition and was subsequently destroyed. The Neue Galerie has a contemporary postcard of the lost work, as well as the painting&apos;s frame, hanging empty. By 1937 a commission led by Adolf Ziegler, Hitler&apos;s favorite painter, was charged with purging German museums of unacceptable art. About 600 of those seized works were included in the Degenerate Art exhibition, which opened on 19 July 1937 \u2013 the day after Hitler&apos;s Great German Art show at the purpose-built, gruesomely fascistic Haus der Deutsche Kunst (renamed the Haus der Kunst, this gallery is now directed by the remarkable Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor and presented an admirable exhibition in 2012 on its Nazi history). Where the art in the Great German Art show hung in neoclassical style, the Degenerate Art show displayed paintings cheek-by-jowl on the walls, ringed with angry or derisive texts such as &quot;madness becomes method&quot; or &quot;revelation of the Jewish racial soul.&quot; The Neue Galerie show wisely refuses to recreate that 1937 hang. The art here has ample room to breathe; Nazi slogans are kept off the walls. Instead the curator, German art historian Olaf Peters, has included a short film taken at the two Munich shows. These show the galleries of the Degenerate Art exhibition crowded with visitors, but nobody looks shocked or disgusted. Many might have been seeing modern art for the very first time.     Adolf Ziegler (1892-1959), The Four Elements: Fire (left wing), Earth and Water (center panel), Air (right wing), 1937.  Photograph: Art Resource, NY  / bpk, Berlin/    Only a small number of the artists in the degenerate art shows were Jewish. Felix Nussbaum, a surrealist who was murdered at Auschwitz, was not included; Emil Nolde, a Nazi party member whose autobiography is laced with anti-Semitism, was. Degeneracy was a fluid concept, applied to a wide swath of artists, and their fates varied as much as their paintings. Paul Klee, represented here by three exquisite watercolors that all hung in Munich, made it to Switzerland, but he couldn&apos;t obtain citizenship thanks to Nazi condemnation. Dix fled to the German countryside, Beckmann to the Netherlands and then America. Kokoschka, in Britain, proudly painted his &quot;self-portrait as a degenerate artist&quot;. Kirchner killed himself. However central aesthetics were to Nazism, Peters takes pains to clarify that the party&apos;s views of art did not come out of nowhere. The concept of degeneracy \u2013 the idea that artists could have pathological disorders, that their art could be not just bad but sick, even contagious \u2013 was widely debated during the era of Bismarck, most prominently by the Austro-Hungarian physician and critic Max Nordau, whose 1892-93 book Entartung (&quot;Degeneration&quot;) warned that any society could be corrupted by decayed ideas of beauty and virtue. &quot;Degenerates are not always criminals, prostitutes, anarchists and pronounced lunatics; they are often authors and artists,&quot; Nordau argued. His theories on art and illness ripple through the writings of Nazi race ideology, including Mein Kampf \u2013 even though, in one of the most brutal ironies of modern art history, Nordau was not just Jewish but a committed Zionist, and he&apos;s buried in Tel Aviv. For the Nazis, modernism was not just an inferior or distasteful style. It wasn&apos;t even just non-Aryan. Modernism was a swindle \u2013 a dangerous lie perpetuated by Jews, communists, and even the insane to contaminate the body of German society (they were fond of medical and corporeal metaphors, the Nazis). The stakes are clear in the largest gallery of this show, which features two triptychs side by side.

The charges related to Olmert&apos;s time as mayor of Jerusalem, and claims that millions of dollars were paid to politicians, officials and businesspeople to fast-track a luxury real estate project in Jerusalem. The &quot;Holyland affair&quot; forced Olmert to resign as prime minister in 2009, although he vociferously denied any wrongdoing. In 2012, Olmert was acquitted of corruption charges relating to his dealings with US businesspeople. Judge David Rozen said in court on Monday that the case &quot;exposed governance that grew more corrupt and rotten over the years&quot;, including bribes paid to public officials. Olmert is not the first senior Israeli politician to face court on corruption charges \u2013 the country has seen a spate of political scandals surrounding its senior politicians in recent years. Avraham Hirchson, a former finance minister, was sentenced to five years in prison in 2009 for stealing $500,000 from the National Labour Federation. He was convicted by a Tel Aviv court on charges of theft, executive theft and money-laundering. As prime minister, Olmert is remembered as the architect of the second Lebanon war in the summer of 2006, as well as the three-week conflict in Gaza that began on 27 December 2008. He was also involved in secret peace negotiations with the Palestinians when he was forced to resign in 2009. On Sunday, there was an expectation that the trial could be extended after Olmert&apos;s long-time aide Shula Zaken turned state&apos;s witness and agreed to testify against him. She did not testify before the end of the trial. Dr Ronen Bergman, a senior correspondent for Israeli daily Yedioth Athronoth, said the conviction was &quot;a gloomy day for Israel&quot;. Olmert&apos;s supporters had claimed he was a victim of a system that required politicians to be close to powerful businesspeople and interest groups in order to succeed. But Bergman said he did not agree. &quot;There are many who say he was an excellent prime minister, on the verge of making peace with the Palestinians and presiding over a period of prosperity, and that\u00a0\u2026 being a good prime minister is better than being honest.

Amid a flurry of intense diplomatic contacts in Jerusalem, state department officials announced that Kerry was flying to Tel Aviv from Paris and would arrive in the region on Monday evening. According to the officials, Kerry spoke with leaders from both sides as well as with the White House before deciding to travel. &quot;After consulting with his team, secretary Kerry decided it would be productive to return to the region,&quot; said the state department spokesperson Jen Psaki. There had been talk that Kerry would return to the region later in the week, underlining the urgency of his latest efforts. The last 48 hours have seen a series of revolving-door meetings between Martin Indyk, the US special envoy to the negotiations, the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and the Israeli justice minister, Tzipi Livni, who heads the Israeli negotiating team. &quot;They are trying to find a solution since no one wants the talks to blow up,&quot; Haaretz quoted a senior Israeli official as saying. Last week Kerry interrupted a visit to Rome to go to Amman for talks with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to try to convince him to prolong the talks beyond a 29 April deadline for a deal, and to press Israel to release prisoners. The two sides have been deadlocked over the issue of a fourth tranche of Palestinian prisoners held long-term in Israeli jails whom Israel committed to release in exchange for the negotiations that began eight months ago. In exchange for the release of 104 prisoners in four stages, with the final release due at the end of March, the Palestinian leadership agreed not to proceed with seeking recognition at the United Nations. But with little substantive progress on the key issues \u2013 aimed at setting a framework agreement for further negotiations for a two-state solution \u2013 the final prisoner release has emerged as an increasingly intractable problem. The Israeli government has said it is unwilling to go ahead with the latest prisoner release until it has a commitment from Abbas to extend this phase of the negotiations. On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said the talks were &quot;verging on a crisis&quot;. The Palestinian side says Israel is in breach of its promise to release the prisoners, and argues that any extension of the peace talks beyond the deadline set by the US of the end of April should not be tied to that issue. &quot;We are in the crucial hours,&quot; said one Palestinian official familiar with the talks. &quot;Netanyahu is saying that his governing coalition is at risk if he does not get an agreement to extend the talks ahead of the prisoner release. Our position is that if he cannot keep to a commitment he made on the prisoner issue, how will he be able to negotiate over issues like east Jerusalem [which Palestinians claim as a capital of their future state].&quot; Echoing those remarks, Mohammed Ishtayeh, an aide to Abbas, accused Israel of &quot;trying to blackmail us&quot;. But Palestinian officials stopped short of threatening to walk out of the talks altogether. Erekat confirmed that negotiations were ongoing and said Abbas was making every possible effort to ensure the prisoners&apos; release. Netanyahu has been facing the threat of rebellion from members of his own Likud party and coalition partners if he goes ahead with a further prisoner release, especially if that involves a group of jailed Israeli-Arabs whom Palestinians want included in the final group. Israeli officials have said they believe they are under no obligation to carry out the final release because of what they say is a Palestinian failure to negotiate in good faith. Yuval Steinitz, a Likud cabinet minister, said it was clear the release could not be carried out if Abbas planned on walking out of the talks the next day. &quot;This release was meant to be carried out as the talks proceed, and not when they fall apart.&quot; Officials have said the two sides remain far apart even on the draft framework. However, Psaki said on Monday that the Israelis and Palestinians had both made tough choices over the past eight months. &quot;As we work with them to determine the next steps, it is important they remember that only peace will bring the Israeli and Palestinian people both the security and economic prosperity they all deserve,&quot; she said.", "publicationDate": "2014-03-31T14:27:30Z", "title": "John Kerry returns to Middle East with peace talks close to crisis", "sentences": ["Amid a flurry of intense diplomatic contacts in Jerusalem, state department officials announced that Kerry was flying to Tel Aviv from Paris and would arrive in the region on Monday evening."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/john-kerry-middle-east-peace-talks-crisis"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "The Rolling Stones", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza"], "article": "The Rolling Stones have confirmed they will play a gig in Tel Aviv in June as part of their 14 On Fire tour. Inevitably, they are already under pressure to cancel their appearance in &quot;apartheid Israel&quot; by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement,a campaign that has had mixed success. The academic rock star Stephen Hawking and Pink Floyd&apos;s Roger Waters are firmly in the boycott camp, while the author Ian McEwan and the musician Alicia Keys have resisted pressure to pull appearances. But there&apos;s little doubt that the drive for a boycott of Israel in protest at its 47-year occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza is gathering steam. The latest body to back a boycott is Riba, Britain&apos;s leading architectural association, which last month called on the International Union of Architects to suspend Israeli membership on the grounds of &quot;complicity in the construction of illegal settlements and other violations of international law&quot;. The boycott movement was boosted earlier this year by publicity surrounding Scarlett Johansson&apos;s endorsement of SodaStream. How many people before then even knew that SodaStream was based in Israel, let alone that its main manufacturing plant was in a West Bank settlement? The US secretary of state, John Kerry, performed a similar service when he warned Israeli leaders of the consequences of a failure of current peace talks. &quot;The risks are very high for Israel,&quot; he said. &quot;People are talking about boycott. That will intensify in the case of failure.&quot; Kerry is right: more people are now talking about boycotting Israel than ever before. The issue is gaining traction even among US academic bodies, previously thought impervious due to the oft cited &quot;unbreakable bond&quot; between the two countries. Israel is angered by the boycott calls, and alarmed at the movement&apos;s momentum. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, recently launched an attack on Europe and its dark history. &quot;I think the most eerie thing, the most disgraceful thing, is to have people on the soil of Europe talking about the boycott of Jews. In the past, antisemites boycotted Jewish businesses and today they call for the boycott of the Jewish state \u2026 the boycotters must be exposed for what they are. They&apos;re classical antisemites in modern garb.&quot; This is a serious charge, and one that causes deep discomfort to many who want to bring pressure to bear on the Israeli government over its policies towards the Palestinians, but who also vigorously oppose antisemitism in any form. Opposing the occupation does not equate to antisemitism or a rejection of Jews&apos; right to, and need for, a homeland. The repeated accusation of antisemitism does not make it true, however frequently it is levelled by those who defend Israel unconditionally. But this is not to say that there is unity within the boycott movement. Many draw a distinction between a settlement boycott \u2013 rejecting goods originating in Jewish colonies in the West Bank; cutting ties with settlement-based institutions; or demanding international companies divest from enterprises with links across the &quot;green line&quot; \u2013 and a boycott of Israel itself. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has made his position clear. &quot;We do not support the boycott of Israel. But we ask everyone to boycott the products of the settlements,&quot; he said in December. Critics of Israeli policies who oppose a boycott of Israel itself argue that ordinary citizens should not be penalised for the government&apos;s actions; that dialogue with academic, business and cultural bodies is more productive than shunning them; and that the shameful history of boycotting Jews makes this option impossible to contemplate. But others \u2013 increasingly frustrated by Israel&apos;s intransigence, the dismal prospects for the peace process, and the failure of the international community to back up critical words with meaningful actions \u2013 say that only when Israeli citizens and institutions feel the consequences of their government&apos;s policies will they force change from within. Many Israelis are shielded from the occupation. To those soaking up the sun on a Tel Aviv beach or working in a hi-tech hub in Haifa, Gaza and the West Bank feel like another planet. The daily grind experienced by more than 4\u00a0million Palestinians living under military occupation just a few dozen miles away barely registers. A boycott \u2013 whether it&apos;s the ending of academic links; the refusal of artists to perform; the divestment of international companies for reputational reasons; or a consumer rejecting Israeli produce in the supermarket \u2013 has the potential to jolt Israelis from this somnolence. Of course, there&apos;s a risk of such pressure entrenching Israel&apos;s stance. But Israel frequently proclaims itself to be the only true democracy in the Middle East. Should its citizens demand an end to policies that have brought them economic pain, isolation and global opprobrium, their government will surely be forced to take notice.", "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T08:00:00Z", "title": "A boycott can jolt Israelis from their somnolence on Palestine | Harriet Sherwood", "sentences": ["The Rolling Stones have confirmed they will play a gig in Tel Aviv in June as part of their 14 On Fire tour.", "To those soaking up the sun on a Tel Aviv beach or working in a hi-tech hub in Haifa, Gaza and the West Bank feel like another planet."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/04/boycott-israelis-palestine-economic-pain-demand-change"}, {"tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Amazon Fire TV first impressions &gt;&gt; PVRblog Matt Haughey:   The biggest failing is that end users (that&apos;s us!) don&apos;t get a truly\u00a0Universal Search.

Microsoft Office for the iPad: it&apos;s delightfully familiar &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Farhad Manjoo:   the most startling thing about using Office on an iPad is how comfortable it feels. Sure, the tablet version, which has to accommodate touch input, not a mouse pointer, looks different from the desktop version. The stripped-down interface has fewer advanced features than on your desktop, and the menus are blessedly minimalist, showing only the main options you&apos;d need for any given task. Yet despite the new look, everything about the software is obvious. For the most part, the iPad versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote work exactly as they do on PCs and Macs. This is a testament to the designers and engineers at Microsoft and to the power of long-term training. Other than my web browser, there&apos;s no software I use more often than Word, so I&apos;ve internalized all its tics. I know the keyboard shortcuts, the menu options, the ins and outs of esoteric features like Track Changes. As I used the iPad version, I felt it click into the same neural grooves dug out by the years I&apos;ve spent on desktop Office. If you&apos;re familiar with Office, you won&apos;t face any learning curve in the new version. If you love Office on your computer, you&apos;ll love it on your iPad.

Dejagah witnessed that upsurge first-hand as a member of Magath&apos;s side, a player flung on from the bench at Hoffenheim on the final day with the scores level and everything in the balance, before Mario Mandzukic and Grafite completed the visitors&apos; scoring. These days the Iranian and the man once nicknamed &quot;the Torturer&quot; by his overworked players are reunited, the former&apos;s role again often one of impact substitute \u2013 largely owing to a niggling groin injury \u2013 and with the last batch of fixtures critical: Tottenham Hotspur away , then Hull, Stoke and Crystal Palace. After Martin Jol and Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, it is up to Magath to inspire the recovery. &quot;And winning the last two games has given us the belief and confidence,&quot; Dejagah says. &quot;Fulham has to play in the Premier League and Felix Magath is the right manager to achieve that. A good appointment, a good option. &quot;Back home in Germany he is a big name, a manager who has won championships with Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg, a man with a reputation. He has the ability to relax people, to get them focused. He knows when the time is to work, or to make &apos;funnies&apos;. He recognises the balance needed, and it&apos;s important to have someone who has been through this before. At Wolfsburg we needed a win on the last day [to avoid a relegation play-off] and he saw us through it. He speaks a lot to his players, reassures them, reminds us what our jobs are. The most difficult thing in this situation is the pressure, what happens in here [he taps his head], but he releases that just by talking to us. We believed before the Norwich game, and after the game we believed even more. We won at Tottenham last season, so we have a chance.&quot; Dejagah&apos;s attitude is almost matter of fact, that of a player who has seen this before and will endure the drama in the unswerving belief his team will emerge triumphant. Pressure might eat away at others but this is a 27-year-old who has endured much over a career that has taken in three clubs and two national setups, his allegiances inked on his body: his right forearm sports the word &quot;Teheran&quot;, the German spelling of the city where he was born in 1986; his left arm &quot;Berlin&quot;, where he grew up and played for Hertha. His neck is tattooed with the mantra: &quot;Never forget where you&apos;re from&quot;. He had been capped from junior to under-21 level by Germany, winning the 2009 European Championship after moving to Wolfsburg, before his club career endured a lull, his progress checked by injury, and a wave of younger players leapfrogged him in the pecking order. &quot;Germany had a lot coming through, a new generation, so that was a hard situation for me but I&apos;d always had the option to play for Iran. Both my parents are Iranian. My wife, like me, is Iranian but brought up in Germany, so we all spoke and I followed my heart. I was born in Tehran. I have a lot of family there. I still count Iran and Germany as &apos;my countries&apos;, but I&apos;m proud to represent Iran: a beautiful country whose fans love football. Sometimes people \u2013 team-mates, friends \u2013 ask me: &apos;How is it there?&apos; I can just say it&apos;s a nice country with nice people. Other things, I don&apos;t want to speak about. Other things \u2026 I go there to play football, to see my family, to represent my country. That is what I know. I&apos;m proud to play for Iran but a lot of people see just the negatives, the things that are reported in the news. That&apos;s why they&apos;re scared a bit about Iran. I can just say the Iranian people are very nice, and it&apos;s my country.&quot; That represents the extent to which Dejagah is prepared to dip into politics, his caution an acknowledgement Iran \u2013 where he established his career \u2013 is still considered a pariah state by the west. His reticence is understandable. It is seven years since he pulled out of a trip to Tel Aviv with Germany&apos;s Under-21s, a decision accepted by the coaching hierarchy and born of concern at potential reprisals on his family in Iran, whose government have not recognised Israel since the 1979 December Revolution. Iranian athletes have invented mysterious ailments to swerve similar dilemmas over the years, with Dejagah guilty most obviously of being too honest. Yet his withdrawal drew stinging criticism from Germany&apos;s Central Council of Jews and politicians in his adopted country. Recollection prompts a shudder of apprehension. &quot;This was a long time ago,&quot; he says. &quot;It is in the past. Yes, it helped me grow up but now I only look to the future.&quot; That future, beyond the culmination of the English domestic season, is a World Cup in Brazil where Iran, ranked 37 by Fifa and under Carlos Queiroz&apos;s stewardship, will attempt to unsettle Argentina, the Africa Cup of Nations champions Nigeria and the newcomers, Bosnia and Herzegovina. &quot;Team Melli&quot; have added talent from the Iranian diaspora to their squad \u2013 Dejagah, Daniel Davari, Reza Ghoochannejhad and Steven Beitashour, born in San Jose, California and currently with Vancouver Whitecaps \u2013 with Queiroz having called in his contacts to secure friendlies with Belarus, Montenegro and Angola as preparation next month. &quot;I know it&apos;s not easy to take friendly games with Iran but Queiroz has experience,&quot; says Dejagah, who scored twice on debut against Qatar. &quot;That&apos;s why he can arrange these games. It&apos;s an unbelievable thing for Iran, to be in Brazil. &quot;The whole country is proud, even if we felt obliged to qualify. We had 100,000 people in the national stadium screaming for us, and we are the second best team in Asia after Japan. But at the tournament itself, no pressure. We can go there and just play. If we get into the next round, it&apos;ll be the first time for Iran. Argentina will go through as group winners, but against Nigeria and Bosnia we have a chance. Why not? We have a talented team. &quot;I know there are not as many Iranians playing in &apos;big&apos; leagues now, particularly in the Bundesliga. There is Reza [at Charlton] also here but it&apos;s hard for our younger players to make names for themselves. I was luckier, growing up in Germany, but not many scouts go to Iran to watch games. Maybe they come from teams in Dubai or Qatar but you need a lot of luck to be spotted and given an opportunity by a European team. That&apos;s why I hope, in this World Cup, our players show the world how good they are.&quot; Until that pool of talent is tapped, Dejagah is a lonely ambassador for his country, a cult figure at Craven Cottage and an \u00e9migr\u00e9 with survival on his mind. &quot;If we stay up with Felix Magath in charge of us, Fulham will surprise a few teams with what we might achieve. Look at Wolfsburg: after that fight against relegation, we almost qualified for Europe the following season.&quot; The German club finished eighth, four points off the Europa League qualification places.

The leader of the eponymous &quot;gang&quot; \u2013 its Hebrew name meant &quot;Fighters for the Freedom of Israel&quot; \u2013 was shot and killed in February 1942 after masterminding a wave of terrorist attacks on British targets with the goal of securing Jewish independence in the holy land. Now a new account of Stern&apos;s life, focusing on his violent death, raises fascinating questions \u2013 and serves as a vivid reminder of a fateful stage in the development of the world&apos;s most intractable conflict. Patrick Bishop, author of several acclaimed military histories, has skillfully re-created a drama that pitted the charismatic, Polish-born Stern against the British detective Geoffrey Morton, who tracked down his quarry to what was supposed to be a safe house in Tel Aviv - thus the &quot;reckoning&quot; of the book&apos;s title. Morton had risen through the ranks of the Palestine Police from humble origins. He was a loyal servant of an imperial power &quot;holding the ring&quot; - with considerable brutality especially in the second half of the 1930s - in a confrontation its own policies had done much to create. He insisted from the start that he shot Stern while the prisoner was trying to get away, arguing &quot;justifiable homicide.&quot; Eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence contradicts this. Bishop has done some smart sleuthing, aided by the lucky discovery of Morton&apos;s private papers. These record a life-long determination to defend his reputation and see off his detractors, if necessary in court. (He declined to respond to my questions when I contacted him some years ago). The book strongly suggests, but does not quite prove, that he in fact killed Stern in cold blood. Stern was certainly an extreme figure: his underground nom de guerre was Yair - homage to the leader of the first century Jewish Zealots who killed themselves rather than surrender to the Romans. His violence put him at odds with the mainstream Zionist movement and its Haganah militia at a time of great peril both for the British empire and the Jews of Europe as the Nazi extermination machine cranked into action. Stern&apos;s men planted bombs, robbed banks and killed British officials as well as Jews and Arabs. They saw themselves as anti-colonial rebels. This ignored the crucial fact that without the fateful promise of the Balfour declaration and the British mandate to implement it in the face of Arab opposition, there would have been no Jewish national home in Palestine. Still, anti-British feeling was fuelled by draconian restrictions on Jewish immigration and land sales that had been imposed on the eve of the second world war. The Stern gang and the like-minded but larger Irgun, led by Menachem Begin, found it easy to recruit. The British saw Stern as a potential Quisling who was ready to do deals with the Italians and even the Germans. When Morton gunned him down Rommel was advancing on Egypt and threatening to break through into Palestine, where Britain&apos;s suppression of the Arab rebellion had created sympathy for its enemies.     The Reckoning, by Patrick Bishop Photograph: William Collins Books    The Reckoning is a good story but it needs no embellishment. I would quibble with the book&apos;s subtitle: &quot;how the killing of one man changed the fate of the promised land.&quot; Stern&apos;s death changed very little. The group carried on fighting the British ruthlessly and effectively: two Sternists assassinated Lord Moyne, Churchill&apos;s minister for the Middle East, in Cairo in 1944. In 1948 the group took part in the infamous Deir Yassin massacre, an important trigger for the flight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, the centrepiece of the &quot;nakbah.&quot; It also assassinated the UN mediator, Count Bernadotte. Stern&apos;s martyrdom still inspired his followers many years later.  But as the Israelis would discover when fighting the Palestinians, determined terrorists/freedom fighters often grow another head when one is lopped off. The group was disbanded after the creation of Israel but another of its leaders, Yitzhak Shamir, followed the Irgun&apos;s Begin to become prime minister in the 1990s. Stern&apos;s analysis, at the the end of the day, was correct: if the Jews were to have their independent state in Palestine, the Arabs would have to be defeated - and the British would have to go.", "publicationDate": "2014-04-23T14:12:00Z", "title": "Long shadow over Palestine killing", "sentences": ["Patrick Bishop, author of several acclaimed military histories, has skillfully re-created a drama that pitted the charismatic, Polish-born Stern against the British detective Geoffrey Morton, who tracked down his quarry to what was supposed to be a safe house in Tel Aviv - thus the &quot;reckoning&quot; of the book&apos;s title."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2014/apr/23/israel-palestinian-territories"}, {"tags": ["Media", "Daily Mirror", "Israel", "Censorship", "Saddam Hussein", "National newspapers", "Newspapers"], "article": " My posting yesterday, &quot;New York Times obeys Israeli gag order over journalist&apos;s arrest&quot;, mentioned the fact that journalists working in Israel are expected to sign a censorship document in order to obtain a press card. It reminded one of my former Daily Mirror colleagues, Gordon Hay, of his experiences in Tel Aviv during the 1991 Gulf War when Iraq launched missile attacks on Israel. Here is his recollection of events...  I arrived in Israel in the early days of the war. Foreign journalists weren&apos;t asked to sign press accreditation declarations, but we were asked to submit all copy and photographs to the Israeli Defence Force censors before filing. They were handily based, like the rest of us, in the Tel Aviv Hilton. I guess our initial intentions were to conform to the instructions. That would have been easy had all remained fairly calm. But very soon after our arrival in Israel, Saddam Hussein began lobbing Scud missiles into Tel Aviv and the surrounding area.  The first rule was immediately broken by the assembled Fleet Street hacks, that when the sirens went off before such attacks we should head for the sealed floor. Few of us did.  How can you report details of the attacks from a sealed unit from where you could see, or learn, nothing? Worse, the satellite phone service was limited. Had an attack continued for many hours, we would have been stuck there with no exit until the all-clear was sounded. So we watched the defensive Patriot missiles go up - from a launch site a few miles north of the hotel - and jumped into hire cars and cabs to head for the streets that had been hit by the Scuds.  Afterwards, we returned to the hotel press centre for whatever briefing was being given by the government or IDF spokespeople. Then, with the foreign press corps composing their stories, Fleet Street&apos;s finest did what they always did - went straight to their rooms, or designated landline phones, to dictate copy down the line with few words written.  The Israeli press officials were, at first, bemused by this practice, admitting they&apos;d never encountered such a thing before. But they also realised they were powerless to censor anything considered troublesome.  Instead, they sent floor-walkers to patrol behind the Brit-pack and listen in to what was being sent. But how do you censor copy that&apos;s already in London&apos;s hands? I remember American reporters emerging from the censor&apos;s room with blacked-out, redacted scrawls across their typed copy. Those censored reports reached their newspapers a considerable time after the London papers were on the streets with the off-the-notebook pieces from us hacks. From memory, I think the IDF gave up and trusted us - kind of - not to send any detail that might endanger security, given that our own safety might also be at risk.  They did ask us in one briefing that we stop using the names of streets where the Scuds had damaged property and not to use the real names of witnesses who we quoted. One press official explained that the Iraqis might have Tel Aviv phone books and, if so, could fine-tune the Scuds to pinpoint more strategic targets.  I&apos;m not sure we totally believed that, but we agreed to the request anyway because of obvious bonus, a page lead headlined: &quot;Saddam Hussein has a secret weapon against his hated enemy, Israel - the Tel Aviv phone book.&quot; There was no complaint, as far as I recall.

An elegant hideaway for a Cold War spy, I thought, as I\u00a0stepped out of my taxi. I pressed the bell marked Klingberg. &quot;Floor three,&quot; said a woman&apos;s voice on the intercom. Inside his one-room apartment, Marcus Klingberg, the 95-year-old KGB master spy, was waiting for me. I recognised him from newspaper photos. Barely 5ft tall, with a bald, outsized head on a slender frame, he had finely rimmed spectacles, a trace of a goatee, and was wearing a\u00a0pale blue shirt and grey trousers. He smiled as he greeted me with outstretched arms. &quot;So pleased to meet you after all these years,&quot; he said. Twenty-eight years to be precise. The last time I had tried to interview Klingberg was in Israel in 1985. I was a foreign correspondent for the Observer based in Washington DC. The Cold War raged. In a superpower confrontation, the Americans had accused the Soviets of violating arms-control treaties by using a\u00a0new chemical weapon known as yellow rain. Samples of the weapon from the battlefields of southeast Asia and Afghanistan were said to contain a deadly toxin, a poisonous chemical produced by the common fungus Fusarium. The Soviets had vigorously denied the charge. Government scientists in Britain, America&apos;s closest ally, discovered pollen in the samples and independent scientists in America discovered, bizarrely, that the yellow spots they had found were indistinguishable from pollen-laden bee faeces. The bewildering question was whether the US could have mistaken bee droppings for a new chemical weapon. Klingberg was an expert in the effects of Fusarium toxin. A Polish Jew, he had fled, at his father&apos;s urging, to Russia at the start of the Second World War and served as a doctor in the Red Army. His family perished in Treblinka in 1943. Klingberg, by then an epidemiologist, had successfully traced an outbreak of food poisoning that killed thousands of Russians to the consumption of mouldy wheat infested with the Fusarium poison. After the war, Klingberg emigrated to Israel where he became a high-ranking military officer, and a deputy scientific director of Israel&apos;s top-secret chemical and biological weapons laboratories at Ness Ziona, 12 miles from Tel Aviv. I\u00a0had gone to Israel to interview him, hoping he could shed some light on the yellow rain affair. But instead of meeting Klingberg, I unwittingly became part of an east-west espionage drama. Israeli officials told me Klingberg had &quot;disappeared&quot;. They said he had suffered a mental breakdown and was in a clinic somewhere in Europe. But his colleagues at Ness Ziona and at Tel Aviv University, where he was also a\u00a0professor of epidemiology, did not believe the official story. Knowing his admiration for the Red Army during the war, some of them wondered if he might have defected to Russia, taking with him western military secrets about chemical and biological weapons.     Catch me if you can: Klingberg with his wife, Wanda, in the 1950s.    I interviewed Klingberg&apos;s wife, Wanda, who was still living in the couple&apos;s Tel Aviv apartment. Mysteriously, she said she knew where her husband was, but couldn&apos;t tell me. Immediately after the interview, someone smashed the rear window of my rental car and stole my passport and a satchel with my notebook and papers on Klingberg. My story for the Observer, published on 8 September 1985, suggested Klingberg&apos;s &quot;disappearance&quot; might have had something to do with his secret work at Ness Ziona, and also mentioned that his colleagues thought he might have defected to the Soviet Union. The story was the first to link Klingberg to his secret weapons work, but the Israeli government censor prevented local journalists from following it up. For the next five years, only his wife and a handful of family members knew what had really happened, and the government swore them to secrecy. Klingberg had not disappeared. In 1983, he was secretly arrested on charges of espionage \u2013 the highest-ranking Soviet spy caught in Israel. Then aged 64, Klingberg was sentenced to the maximum penalty of 20 years in jail. He served the first 10 years in solitary confinement and was given a false name, Abraham Grinberg, and a false profession \u2013 editor of a\u00a0social-science journal. In 1993, after the Soviet Union had collapsed, the Israeli government finally admitted Klingberg was in jail \u2013 and had another 10 years to serve. He had health problems and 39 members of the Israeli Knesset and Amnesty International, taking pity on him, launched separate appeals for his early release. But Israel&apos;s secret services claimed Klingberg still posed a security risk. In 2003, he was finally allowed to leave Israel for exile in Paris \u2013 on condition he never spoke about his secret work at Ness Ziona. That is where the story might have ended, but, in 2007, Klingberg and his Israeli lawyer, Michael Sfard, published a book in Hebrew about his life and how he became a spy. Israeli censors vetted the book before publication to protect Ness Ziona&apos;s secrets. In a world before the internet and cyberspace, Klingberg described in gripping detail how he had &quot;slipped into&quot; a Le Carr\u00e9 world of espionage shortly after he arrived in Israel in 1948. He met his KGB contact every three months by drawing coded signs in chalk on a\u00a0concrete wall in a street in Tel Aviv. In the back room of a Russian Orthodox church, &quot;Moscow Centre&quot; provided vodka and caviar. His code name was &quot;Rok&quot; (fate or destiny in Russian). His KGB control was &quot;Viktor&quot;. His Soviet minders offered him a variety of spy gadgets, including invisible ink and miniature cameras, although he never used them.     Paper trail: Marcus Klingberg and his wife Wanda (right) meet the Israeli defence chief in 1953.     It is reasonable to assume that, at Ness Ziona, Klingberg had access to secrets the Soviets sought. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union lagged behind the US, Britain and France in the development of chemical and biological weapons. It is well known that Ness Ziona was one of the leading experimental weapons laboratories in the west. Ness Ziona scientists have published papers over the years revealing research into nerve gases, such as tabun, sarin and VX, and incapacitating agents and psychotropic drugs, such as LSD. Researchers also studied how insects could transmit plague, typhus and rabies \u2013 all diseases that became part of the US, and in some cases also the British, arsenals before the US unilaterally renounced the production of biological and toxin weapons in 1969. The ban became an international arms-control treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, but Israel has never signed it. &quot;I also knew about the [Israeli] co-operation with foreign institutes in the western world \u2013 the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom,&quot; wrote Klingberg. &quot;They presented themselves as acting only for developing protective measures against chemical and biological warfare. Were they really limited to defence research? Blessed be the believers.&quot; Moscow Centre showed its appreciation for such access. In one of his clandestine meetings, Klingberg was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Soviet Union&apos;s second-rank decoration after the Order of Lenin. But why did he become a spy? In his book he wrote that, like some of the physicists who worked on the American atom bomb, he believed the secrets of weapons of mass destruction should be shared. Both sides in the Cold War would be less likely to use them and more likely to ban them. But he also had his personal reason, he told me. He felt he owed the Russians a debt for saving the world from the Nazis. &quot;I am and always was a communist,&quot; he said. His espionage had been entirely voluntary. Moscow Centre never paid him a penny, he said. He became a master spy, recruiting his wife Wanda, and two friends, one of whom would become a famous scientist. The Israeli reviewers of his book were derisive. The newspaper Haaretz portrayed Klingberg as a self-deceiving actor in the &quot;theatre real&quot; of the espionage world and, in the end, as a &quot;petty clerk, and mainly as a childish and pitiful person&quot;. Israel&apos;s Ynet, a news website, said Klingberg simply fooled himself. &quot;An Israeli who supported the Russians at the beginning of the 1950s was naive. An Israeli who supplied them with secrets in the 60s and 70s was a scoundrel.&quot; In Paris, Klingberg gave perfunctory interviews to the media and then went to ground, refusing to meet even academics writing Cold War histories, though he undoubtedly had much to contribute. But he made an exception for me, he said, because he had a special story to tell me about my attempts to find him in 1983. Over a cup of tea, I sat down with Klingberg and his daughter Sylvia (now 66 and the person who had let me into his Paris apartment). In the small room there was a\u00a0bed, a desk, a bookcase, an armchair and a\u00a0few paintings \u2013 remnants of a long, intense, tragic life covering a wide swath of a violent century: from the Second World War through several Israeli-Arab wars, the Cold War, the build-up of the superpower arsenals of weapons of mass destruction and the fall of the Soviet Union. It is a wonder, frankly, that this frail-looking 95-year-old survived to tell his personal story at all. But he seemed to thrive on it and, remarkably, remembered it in detail. &quot;Your Observer article forced the Israelis to admit I was in jail,&quot; he said, his still-bright blue eyes glinting at the prospect of imparting yet another Cold War secret. &quot;Here is the evidence,&quot; he said, holding up a photocopy of my story from the files of the East German Stasi secret police. By amusing coincidence, the file number on an accompanying explanation in Russian was 000007. Klingberg said that the Israeli secret services had undoubtedly monitored my visit to his wife Wanda in 1985; they must have wondered why this foreign journalist was so interested in their secretly convicted spy. And the theft from my car does not seem to have been the work of a common thief. Several months after my visit to Israel, my satchel, minus key papers and my passport, was returned anonymously to the Observer offices in London. Sylvia fearlessly used the newspaper article to organise an elaborate east-west spy swap that included her father. Growing up in Israel, Sylvia had always been politically active on the left, becoming a member of Matzpen, a group that united dozens of left-wing anti-Zionists. By the 1960s she was a Trotskyist, joining French students at the barricades in Paris in 1968. She married Alain Brossat, a French philosophy professor. Their son, Ian, is now a member of the French Communist Party and an elected member of the Council of Paris \u2013 the city&apos;s governing body. In Israel, Sylvia had always suspected her father was working on chemical and biological weapons \u2013 despite his denials \u2013 and she told him how strongly she disapproved. But after she learned of his arrest, she objected even more strongly to his secret trial and imprisonment \u2013 the Israeli practice of creating an anonymous &quot;Prisoner X&quot; in the name of state security. Knowing she would be banned from visiting him in jail, Sylvia launched a campaign for his release. In 1986, she contacted Antoine Comte, a\u00a0well-known human rights lawyer in Paris. &quot;We didn&apos;t know where to start,&quot; Comte told me in a separate interview. &quot;We were so naive. We went to see the cultural attach\u00e9 at the Russian embassy and he threw up his hands in horror at being involved in anything to do with spies.&quot; Comte then contacted Wolfgang Vogel, the flamboyant East German lawyer famous for brokering spy swaps \u2013 including the much-publicised 1962 exchange in Berlin of the downed American U-2 pilot  Gary Powers for the Soviet intelligence agent, Rudolf Abel, who had been caught and convicted in the US in 1957. Comte flew to East Berlin and told Vogel about Klingberg&apos;s story, showing him a copy of my Observer article as evidence \u2013 the evidence that would make its way into the Stasi files. Vogel was astonished he had never heard of Klingberg&apos;s imprisonment. &quot;A\u00a0man who worked for the KGB in the west has been arrested and I know nothing of it?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Impossible. Maybe Professor Klingberg went crazy and gave himself up.&quot; He promised to investigate the matter. Several months later, Comte received word from Vogel that Moscow Centre needed to verify Klingberg&apos;s story. Sylvia should go alone to Leningrad, where she would be contacted. She went during Christmas 1986. Shortly after checking into her hotel she received a phone call from a man who introduced himself as &quot;Peter&quot;. He was staying in the same hotel. &quot;You should come to my room,&quot; he told her. &quot;He was a tall, very handsome man of about 65 or 70,&quot; Sylvia recalled. They met twice for about four hours. Peter showed her photos and documents, astonishing Sylvia with how much he knew of her private life. He asked her to identify the author of a handwritten letter. It was from her mother. Peter apologised for the interrogation, saying it was necessary to make sure there were &quot;no contradictions&quot; in her story. He even offered to help Sylvia pay for her legal expenses, but she declined, sternly reminding him why she had come. &quot;My father did a lot for you. Now, it&apos;s your turn. Get him out of prison.&quot; &quot;We will do all we can,&quot; Peter promised. For two years, Sylvia and Comte heard nothing. In early 1988, as Mikhail Gorbachev was introducing his glasnost reforms in the Soviet Union, Vogel called for a meeting in Paris with a lawyer representing the Israeli government, Comte and Sylvia. Vogel&apos;s initial proposal was to swap Klingberg for unnamed &quot;American spies&quot; in Russia. But the Israeli lawyer insisted Israel had to get &quot;our flesh&quot; \u2013 an Israeli. He wanted Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator who was forced to bail out of his crippled F-4 Phantom jet on a\u00a0bombing mission during Israel&apos;s 1986 invasion of Lebanon, and was now in the hands of Hezbollah. If Israel let Klingberg go to Moscow, Israel wanted Moscow to negotiate Arad&apos;s release. Vogel suggested extending the swap to include Jonathan Pollard, the US Navy intelligence officer who was convicted in 1986 for passing military secrets to Israel and sentenced to life in prison. Pollard never faced trial \u2013 at the request of both the US and the Israeli governments he entered a plea and the details of his case remain unknown. All appeals for his early release have been rejected, but are apparently being considered again by Washington as part of the Middle East peace talks. Then the Israeli lawyer made a new demand: for the remains of two Israeli soldiers who had been killed during the Lebanon invasion. Vogel said he could arrange this \u2013 apparently through Soviet contacts with Hezbollah. In his jail cell, Klingberg found out about the secret negotiations from his Israeli interrogator, who turned up one day in a furious temper. &quot;Your daughter consulted a French lawyer without our authorisation,&quot; he shouted. &quot;She violated the ban on family members talking about your arrest with an unauthorised person.&quot; &quot;I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about,&quot; Klingberg protested \u2013 which was true. &quot;You won&apos;t be released. You won&apos;t be transferred to Russia,&quot; the interrogator raged. &quot;And if Sylvia arrives in Israel, she&apos;ll be arrested.&quot; Israel eventually approved the swap, but Klingberg told his jailers he wasn&apos;t interested. &quot;Not interested,&quot; they shot back. &quot;You&apos;ll be a\u00a0hero of the Soviet Union\u2026 You will have an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside, and when you die, they&apos;ll bury you next to Philby.&quot; (Kim Philby was the British double agent who fled to Moscow in 1963). In the end, Hezbollah backed out of the deal. On 28 July 1989, Israeli commandos kidnapped the Lebanese Shia leader, Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, from his home village of Jibchit in southern Lebanon, and the sheikh would spend the next 15 years in an Israeli jail. Klingberg remained in jail, Pollard continued to serve his life sentence in the US and Arad died in Lebanon, either executed by his captors or killed while trying to escape. &quot;But you see,&quot; said Klingberg holding up a copy of the Stasi file that included a 1988 leaked story of the proposed swap in the German newspaper, Die Welt, &quot;Your Observer story forced the Israelis to admit, five years after I had &apos;disappeared&apos;, that I was in jail.&quot; He beamed at the thought. &quot;Now you can ask me about yellow rain.&quot; He knew no secrets, he said, but he had opinions, and he proceeded to introduce a tantalising new clue to the lingering Cold War mystery. Israel&apos;s security services had objected vigorously to Klingberg&apos;s release. He spent the last four years of his prison term \u2013 from the end of 1998 to 2003 \u2013 under house arrest but, sadly, without his wife, Wanda, who had died of heart failure in 1990. Even as he became eligible for full release, Israel&apos;s defence security service, Malmab, demanded that Klingberg be kept under close scrutiny. In a submission to the court, Malmab claimed Klingberg&apos;s &quot;mind contains information he is not aware of&quot;. Klingberg&apos;s lawyers were stumped: there was no defence against charges about things he did not know that he knew. Malmab eventually relented and Klingberg was allowed to leave for exile in Paris as long as he did not talk about his secret work at Ness Ziona. Haaretz said Malmab&apos;s objection &quot;was, of course, an absurd and baseless claim&quot;. But was it? This is where the Klingberg story intriguingly intersects with yellow rain. Three decades later, the US stands by its accusation against the Soviets, and the Russians continue to dismiss the charge. The CIA has written up its official history of yellow rain, but refuses to declassify it, a move the New York Times called &quot;preposterous&quot; after so long. The agency apparently still has something to hide. Asked whether the fungal poisons had ever been on Moscow&apos;s shopping lists presented by his KGB minders in Israel, Klingberg answered definitively: &quot;Never.&quot; Had Moscow Centre ever expressed the slightest interest in the military application of fungal poisons? &quot;Never.&quot; Using Fusarium toxins as a biological weapon had never been discussed when he was in the Soviet Union, he said, and, like the sceptical independent scientists in America and Britain, he could not see the point of putting a fungal toxin into a mix of pollen grains for spraying on a battlefield. He had always assumed yellow rain was American disinformation. In 1985, had I been able to interview Klingberg he would have added an authoritative voice to the growing number of yellow-rain sceptics. Since then, former Soviet officials, familiar with the Soviet chemical and biological programme through the 70s and 80s, have reported they never knew of any effort to turn Fusarium toxins into a weapon. In the 90s, the new Russian government said that in the opinion of its military experts fungal toxins &quot;have no military significance&quot;. Before his arrest, Klingberg had been interrogated twice on suspicion of spying for Moscow: once in 1965 and again in 1976. He was released each time. In 1981, a month after the US yellow-rain charges, Klingberg told me he suddenly felt the Israeli security noose &quot;tightening around my neck&quot;. Israeli agents, he learned, had moved into an apartment opposite in Tel Aviv, and his phone made strange clicking noises. The surveillance continued through 1982. In 1983, Klingberg was due to go on sabbatical to Europe. He planned to lecture at universities, quite openly, on his special subject of epidemiology of congenital malformations. However, given his expertise in Fusarium poisoning in the USSR and the European interest in America&apos;s yellow-rain charges, Klingberg was bound to be asked his opinion about the alleged weapon. And he would have concluded publicly that yellow rain seemed like it might be, well, bee faeces, thus adding to the growing embarrassment over the US charge. Washington must have been relieved when Klingberg, instead of going on sabbatical, simply disappeared. He was arrested on 19 January 1983. He never found out why the Israelis chose that date. And today, he is no closer to unravelling Malmab&apos;s security riddle of the things he does not know that he knows. During one of my visits in Paris, Klingberg celebrated his 95th birthday with a dinner given by Sylvia. Two dozen people turned up to the small Left Bank restaurant: family members and academic friends from Britain and Europe, the lawyer, Antoine Comte, and Klingberg&apos;s Israeli lawyer during his release from prison, Avigdor Feldman. After a\u00a0birthday cake and a chorus of &quot;For He&apos;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;, Feldman leaned his formidable frame across the dinner table like a prosecutor, pressing Klingberg: &quot;Come on Marek [his preferred Polish version of Marcus], what is it you know that you don&apos;t know that you know? Tell us.&apos;&apos; Klingberg smiled and shook his head. &quot;I am just very happy all of you are here today and I thank you for coming,&quot; he said. And then, as bright as ever, he chatted with his guests until almost midnight and walked the two blocks home. Might the things he is supposed to have known be connected to his knowledge of Fusarium and, therefore, to the yellow-rain mystery? I asked. &quot;It&apos;s possible,&quot; he said, again smiling at the thought. &quot;I\u00a0simply don&apos;t know what I&apos;m supposed to know that I don&apos;t know.&quot; Peter Pringle was a foreign correspondent for the Observer from 1981 to 1985.

But their conversation \u2013 switching between Arabic and Hebrew \u2013 centres not on celebrating the historic realisation of the Zionist dream in May 1948, but on the other side of the coin: the flight, expulsion and dispossession that Palestinians call their catastrophe \u2013 the Nakba. Maps, leaflets and posters explain the work of Zochrot \u2013 Hebrew for &quot;Remembering&quot;. The organisation&apos;s mission is to educate Israeli Jews about a history that has been obscured by enmity, propaganda and denial for much of the last 66 years. Next week, Zochrot, whose activists include Jews and Palestinians, will connect the bitterly contested past with the hi-tech present. Its I-Nakba phone app will allow users to locate any Arab village that was abandoned during the 1948 war on an interactive map, learn about its history (including, in many cases, the Jewish presence that replaced it), and add photos, comments and data. It is all part of a highly political and inevitably controversial effort to undo the decades-long erasure of landscape and memory \u2013 and, so the hope goes, to build a better future for the two peoples who share a divided land. &quot;There is an app for everything these days, and this one will show all the places that have been wiped off the map,&quot; explains Raneen Jeries, Zochrot&apos;s media director. &quot;It means that Palestinians in Ein Hilweh refugee camp in Lebanon, say, can follow what happened to the village in Galilee that their family came from \u2013 and they will get a notification every time there&apos;s an update. Its amazing.&quot; In a conflict famous for its irreconcilable national narratives, the basic facts are not disputed, though the figures are. Between November 1947, when the UN voted to partition British-ruled Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states, and mid-1949, when Israel emerged victorious against its enemies, 400-500 Arab villages and towns were depopulated and destroyed or occupied and renamed. Most of them were left in ruins. Understanding has deepened since the late 1980s, when Israeli historians used newly opened state archives to revisit that fateful period. Key elements of this new history contradicted the old, official version and partially confirmed what Palestinians had always claimed \u2013 that many were expelled by Israeli forces rather than fled at the urging of Arab leaders. Fierce debate still rages over whether this was done on an ad hoc basis by local military commanders or according to a masterplan for ethnic cleansing. The result either way was disastrous. Zochrot&apos;s focus on the hyper-sensitive question of the 750,000 Palestinians who became refugees has earned it the hostility of the vast majority of Israeli Jews who flatly reject any Palestinian right of return. Allowing these refugees \u2013 now, with their descendants, numbering seven million people \u2013 to return to Jaffa, Haifa or Acre, the argument goes, would destroy the Jewish majority, the raison d&apos;etre of the Zionist project. (Israelis often also suggest an equivalence with the hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who lost homes and property after 1948 in Arab countries such as Iraq and Morocco - although their departure was encouraged and facilitated by the young state in the 1950s.) &quot;There are a lot of Israeli organisations that deal with the occupation of 1967, but Zochrot is the only one that is dealing with 1948,&quot; said Liat Rosenberg, the NGO&apos;s director. &quot;It&apos;s true that our influence is more or less negligible but nowadays there is no Israeli who does not at least know the word Nakba. It&apos;s entered the Hebrew language, and that&apos;s progress.&quot; Rosenberg and colleagues hold courses and prepare learning resources for teachers, skirting around attempts to outlaw any kind of Nakba commemoration. But the heart of Zochrot&apos;s work is regular guided tours that are designed, like the gimmicky iPhone app, to put Palestine back on the map and to prepare the ground for the refugees&apos; return. On a recent Saturday morning, a couple of dozen Jews and Arabs met at a petrol station on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem and followed a dirt track to al-Walaja, a village of 2,000 inhabitants that was attacked and depopulated in 1948. Zochrot&apos;s Omar al-Ghubari pointed out the concrete foundations \u2013 all that remains \u2013 of a school and marked the spot with a metal sign in Arabic, Hebrew and English, before posing for photographs. Among those following him was Shireen al-Araj, whose father was born in al-Walaja and fled to Beit Jallah across what until 1967 was the armistice line with Jordan. &quot;I have never given up the idea of going back to al-Walaja,&quot; she said. Araj is campaigning against the extension of the West Bank separation wall, part of what she and many Palestinians call a continuing Nakba. Another participant was Tarik Ramahi, an American surgeon raised in Saudi Arabia by Palestinian refugee parents. Marina, a Jewish social worker, came with her boyfriend Tomer, an IT student. Wandering among the ruins, these unconventional daytrippers attracted some curious glances from Israelis picnicking on the terraces or bathing in the village spring \u2013 now named for a Jewish teenager murdered by Palestinians in the 1990s. Claire Oren, a teacher, had a heated argument with two off-duty soldiers who were unaware of al-Walaja&apos;s past \u2013 or even of the extent of Israel&apos;s continuing control of the West Bank. Nearby Ein Karem \u2013 Zochrot&apos;s most popular tour \u2013 is a different story. Abandoned by the Palestinians in July 1948 (it is near Deir Yassin, the scene of the period&apos;s most notorious massacre), it boasts churches, a mosque and fine stone houses clustered around a valley that is choked with wild flowers in the spring. Its first post-war residents were poor Moroccan Jewish immigrants, but it was intensively gentrified in the 1970s and is now one of west Jerusalem&apos;s most desirable neighbourhoods. In 1967, Shlomo Abulafia, now a retired agronomist, moved into a two-room hovel that he and his wife, Meira, have transformed beyond recognition into a gracious Arab-style home set in a charming garden. Relatives of the original owners once visited from Jordan. Like other Israeli Jews who yearn for coexistence with the Palestinians, Abulafia believes it is vital to understand how the other side feels. He worries desperately about the future of his fractured homeland and about his children and grandchildren. &quot;The Nakba is history for us but a catastrophe for them,&quot; he says. &quot;What have we got to lose from recognising the Palestinians&apos; suffering? The two sides are moving further and further away from each other. People live in fear. There is a lot of denial here.&quot; Many other Arab villages disappeared without trace under kibbutz fields and orchards, city suburbs or forests planted by the Jewish National Fund. Arab Isdud became Israeli Ashdod. Saffuriya in Galilee is now Zippori, the town&apos;s Hebrew name before the Arab conquest in the seventh century. Zochrot&apos;s bilingual guide book identifies traces of Arab Palestine all over the country \u2013 fragments of stone wall, clumps of prickly pears that served as fences, or the neglected tombs of Muslim holy men. The faculty club of Tel Aviv University used to be the finest house in Sheikh Muwannis, once on the northern edge of the expanding Jewish city. Nothing else is left. Manshiyeh, a suburb of Jaffa, lies beneath the seaside Charles Clore promenade. Palestinians have long mourned their lost land, eulogising it \u2013 and in recent years documenting it \u2013 with obsessive care. Politically, the right of return remains a totemic demand even if PLO leaders have often said privately that they do not expect it to be implemented \u2013 except for symbolic numbers \u2013 if an independent Palestinian state is created alongside Israel and Jewish settlers uprooted from its territory. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, provoked uproar in 2012 when he said he would not expect to be able to return to his home town of Safed. Older Israeli Jews like Meron Benvenisti, raised in British-ruled Palestine during the 1930s, have written nostalgically about the forgotten landscapes of their childhood. &quot;I also identify with the images of the destroyed villages,&quot; said Danny Rubinstein, a Jerusalem-born author and journalist. &quot;I do understand the Palestinians&apos; longing and I empathise with it. But I think that Zochrot is a mistake. The Palestinians know, or their leadership knows, that they have to forget Ramle and Lod and Jaffa. Abbas says he can&apos;t go back to Safed. They have to give up the return as a national goal. If I was a Palestinian politician I would say that you don&apos;t have to remember. You have to forget.&quot; Hopes for a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians are fading after the collapse of the latest US-brokered effort, and mutual empathy and understanding are in short supply. But Claire Oren, resting in a shady grove in what was once the centre of al-Walaja, thinks more knowledge might help. &quot;Even if only one Israeli becomes a bit more aware of the Nakba and the Palestinian refugees, it is important,&quot; she reflected. &quot;The more Israelis who understand, the more likely we are to be able to prevent another catastrophe in this land.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-02T15:26:47Z", "title": "Remembering the Nakba: Israeli group puts 1948 Palestine back on the map", "sentences": ["In a run-down office in the busy centre of Tel Aviv, a group of Israelis are finalising preparations for this year&apos;s independence day holiday.", "The faculty club of Tel Aviv University used to be the finest house in Sheikh Muwannis, once on the northern edge of the expanding Jewish city."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/nakba-israel-palestine-zochrot-history"}, {"tags": ["Brighton & Hove Albion", "Championship", "Nottingham Forest", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "When \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda was asked if he had ever been involved in any final-day drama before, he did not need long to answer. For the Spaniard, the memories are still fresh in his mind and a smile flashed across his face as he thought back to his time as a player at Barcelona, when entire seasons, careers even, would rest on the events of one day in May. &quot;As a football player, yes,&quot; the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion manager said. &quot;Real Madrid, if you can remember, against Tenerife. Real Madrid lost two seasons in a row and we won the championship.&quot; Spain had rarely seen anything as astonishing as the final day of the 1991-92 La Liga season. Barcelona were still in with a chance of winning the league but they needed Real to slip up against Tenerife. That seemed unlikely when Real led 2-0 after 10 minutes but, to quote Garc\u00eda, sometimes everything can happen in football, and Tenerife stormed back to win 3-2 and hand the title to Barcelona. A year later, lightning struck Real again when they lost their final match 2-0 against, you guessed it, Tenerife, and as if that wasn&apos;t enough, Barcelona won the league in 1994 thanks to their superior goal difference over Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, who drew 0-0 with Valencia in their final game. &quot;They missed a penalty,&quot; Garc\u00eda recalled. In the last minute. So Garc\u00eda is used to getting his own way in these scenarios, which is good news for Brighton, who need Burnley to do them a favour against Reading if they are to snatch the final play-off spot. A draw for Brighton at Nottingham Forest coupled with a Burnley win at the Madejski Stadium would be enough for Garc\u00eda&apos;s side. &quot;I want to feel the same tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to feel the same as I felt as a player, because all the seasons, all the years where this kind of thing happened, we were the winners.&quot; Garc\u00eda has been a winner as a manager too, leading Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Israeli title in his debut season last year. His success in Israel persuaded Brighton to turn to the Spaniard after Gus Poyet left last summer, but he initially found it difficult to implement his ideas in the rough and tumble of the Championship. An extensive injury list throughout the season has been a major hindrance and while Brighton recovered from a poor start that saw them drop to 16th at the end of October, it was a blow to lose Ashley Barnes to Burnley and Liam Bridcutt to Sunderland in January. &quot;It is not easy for any coach to come here, because the style of the Championship is different to all the other leagues in the world,&quot; Garc\u00eda said. &quot;That is why I am really proud of my season and of the players.&quot; He elaborated on the challenges posed by the Championship. &quot;How competitive it is and physical,&quot; he said. &quot;I expected it because some players and managers I spoke with before coming here told me this but when you can see and you can feel on the pitch and in the training sessions, you can see they were telling the truth.&quot; Garc\u00eda was lucky enough to be coached by Johan Cruyff and he is utterly committed to teaching his Brighton players how to play like Barcelona. Yet possession football has taken a kicking this week after Real Madrid&apos;s counterattacking destruction of Pep Guardiola&apos;s tiki-taka Bayern Munich. &quot;In the last four, five or six years, the teams that keep possession \u2013 and not only keep possession, because we are not only speaking about keeping possession, you keep possession to have more chances to score, not only to keep possession, because to only keep possession is boring, you have to keep it in the opposite half and close to the opposition goal to create chances \u2013 the more successful teams are like this, like Spain, like Barcelona,&quot; Garc\u00eda said. &quot;Now they don&apos;t have a good result, but only one year and then one year we have to change. If other styles start to win for four, five or six years in a row then we can speak, but not with one result or one year.&quot; Garc\u00eda is savvy enough not to get too carried away about anything.

At Sunday&apos;s weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said the civil rights of minorities, including Arabs, would be guaranteed, and the move was vital at a time when aspects of Israel&apos;s legitimacy were &quot;under a constant and increasing assault from abroad and at home&quot;. Netanyahu proposed the change last week during a visit to Tel Aviv&apos;s Independence Hall, attracting fierce criticism from political rivals and support from some of his allies. The move follows a Palestinian refusal in peace talks to recognise the status that Netanyahu described. The proposed law would be in addition to Israel&apos;s declaration of independence of May 1948 \u2013 the anniversary of which is celebrated on Tuesday \u2013 which defines Israel as a Jewish state. Most of Israel&apos;s basic laws deal with procedural issues relating to elections, the appointment of the prime minister, state payments and the administration of the judiciary, but some laws have been more controversial, including the 1980 law that designated Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Despite the intention that the new law should guarantee full equal rights, critics say it strays into contentious territory in its explicit definition which, regardless of passport and citizenship, would codify a differential notion of nationhood. Netanyahu laid out his rationale for the change at the cabinet meeting. &quot;The state of Israel is a Jewish and democratic state. Our basic laws give full expression to the democratic side of the state,&quot; he said. &quot;On the other hand, that the state of Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people is not sufficiently expressed in our basic laws, and this is what the draft basic law is meant to provide. &quot;The state of Israel provides full equal rights, individual rights, to all its citizens, but it is the nation state of one people only \u2013 the Jewish people \u2013 and of no other people. And therefore, in order to bolster the status of the state of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, I intend to submit a basic law that will anchor this status.&quot; He added: &quot;Of course, there are those who do not want the state of Israel to be defined as the nation state of the Jewish people. They want a Palestinian nation state to be established alongside us and that Israel should gradually become a binational, Arab-Jewish state inside shrunken borders. But I simply say that one cannot hold the national stick at both of its national ends. &quot;They cannot say that they want to separate from the Palestinians in order to prevent a binational state, which has a certain logic, and also sanctify a binational, Jewish-Arab state within the permanent borders of the state of Israel.&quot; Among those who have expressed concern over the proposal is the justice minister, Tzipi Livni. Although in favour of defining Israel more clearly in law as &quot;the national home of the Jewish people and a democratic state&quot;, she has expressed opposition to &quot;any law that gives superiority&quot; to the Jewish nature of state over the country&apos;s democratic values. She said she could only support legislation where &quot;Jewish and democratic would have the same weight, not more Jewish than democratic, nor more democratic than Jewish&quot;. Her remarks echoed those of the Labour party leader, Isaac Herzog, last week when the idea was first floated. &quot;With all its being, the Labour party supports Israel as a Jewish and democratic state,&quot; he said. &quot;Labour built the state and its leaders formulated the declaration of independence, the foundational document that anchors Israel as a Jewish state. &quot;Unfortunately, the diplomatic destruction Netanyahu is causing will lead Israel to lose its Jewish majority and become a binational state.

Last week, the justice minister, Tzipi Livni, and the internal security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, both argued that rightwing extremists should be classified as terrorists following attacks on soldiers at the hardline West Bank settlement of Yitzhar. And on Friday, the Israeli prize laureate author Amos Oz described the hardline Jewish settlers that carry out so-called &quot;price tag&quot; attacks on Palestinians as neo-Nazis. &quot;Our neo-Nazi groups enjoy the support of numerous nationalist or even racist legislators, as well as rabbis who give them what is in my view pseudo-religious justification,&quot; the 75-year-old said at an event in Tel Aviv. It is not the first time that politicians and public figures in Israel have called for the branding of rightwing settlers as terrorists, but recent events have coalesced into something of a perfect storm. A spate of vandalism in Jerusalem and Galilee has seen rightwing groups target Christians ahead of the visit of Pope Francis, including a graffiti attack on the Vatican building where he is due to stay later this month. Meanwhile, in the hardline settlement of Yitzhar, police arrested a woman for inciting violence towards the IDF, just weeks after Israeli soldiers were attacked when they attempted to dismantle a settler outpost. It also coincides with the failure of the recent round of peace talks, with senior politicians and peace-talks negotiators in the US, Israel and Palestine attributing the breakdown to settlement activity, among other factors. But in the hillside West Bank village of Asira al-Qibliya, which is just 300 metres from Yitzhar, Palestinian villagers see the recent backlash as a case of too little, too late. &quot;It is only words. We don&apos;t want words, we want deeds,&quot; said Bassem Salah, 50, a construction worker. His neighbour Ibrahim Makhlouf, 52, a teacher, also dismissed the comments of Israeli politicians, given the support that the Israeli state provides to settlements in the West Bank. &quot;They say it is a minority, but it is a minority supported by both the government and the army \u2013 they receive free water, free electricity, the government spend millions of dollars on them. Who are they trying to kid?&quot; said Makhlouf. His two-storey home is the closest in the village to Yitzhar, and last year a French NGO installed a metal grate across one side of the building after his windows were broken regularly by stone-throwing radical Zionists. He says that the situation has improved since 2012, when villagers were given cameras to document the attacks. In the past, settlers would tell the IDF that they were provoked, he said, but faced with video evidence the soldiers have been forced to act. But the father-of-four still believes that settlements such as Yitzhar remain the biggest barrier to peace between Israel and Palestine. &quot;As long as there is a settlement here I don&apos;t see a future. This settlement needs to be evacuated. We don&apos;t want Palestine from the river to the sea, we just want them to leave our home town,&quot; he said. &quot;Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] should stop security co-operation, he should stop negotiations. Before the [1994] Oslo Accords the settlement was 9km away, now it is 300 metres. What have we received from the peace process? More settlements.&quot; &quot;There is no compromise,&quot; added Salah, &quot;it is us or them.&quot; A spokesperson for Yitzhar did not reply to requests for comment.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-11T15:40:33Z", "title": "Calls to class far-right Jewish settlers as terrorists after Israeli soldiers attacked", "sentences": ["&quot;Our neo-Nazi groups enjoy the support of numerous nationalist or even racist legislators, as well as rabbis who give them what is in my view pseudo-religious justification,&quot; the 75-year-old said at an event in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/11/calls-classify-far-right-jewish-settlers-attacks-soldiers-amos-oz-neo-nazis"}, {"tags": ["Brighton & Hove Albion", "Derby County", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "\u00d3scar Garc\u00eda has offered his resignation following Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&apos;s defeat in their play-off semi-final against Derby County, with the Spaniard likely to leave this week, despite being given time to mull over his decision. The Brighton manager has had an uneasy relationship with the club&apos;s board since he was appointed last summer and a parting of the ways seems inevitable after he informed them of his desire to leave in the aftermath of the defeat to Steve McLaren&apos;s side. Although Brighton remain supportive of Garc\u00eda, who sought assurances that funds will be made available this summer, and stressed that they want him to stay, he is unlikely to change his mind and has already told his players that he may not be there next season. Garc\u00eda&apos;s desire to find a new challenge will not come as a surprise to Brighton, who have been aware of his dissatisfaction for a while. He believes that they were held back this season by a lack of investment in both transfer windows and the situation was not helped when Ashley Barnes was sold to Burnley and Liam Bridcutt moved to Sunderland in January. Barnes and Bridcutt were both key members of Garc\u00eda&apos;s squad and the 41-year-old&apos;s concern about the direction in which the club was heading grew after they were not adequately replaced. An extensive injury list added to Garc\u00eda&apos;s problems but after a difficult start to the season, he helped Brighton finish sixth and snatch the last play-off spot after they beat Nottingham Forest on the final day of the Championship season. Yet the manner of the defeat to Derby, who beat Brighton 6-2 on aggregate, forced him to evaluate his position. However Brighton may justifiably argue that they are a club on the rise. The move to The Amex Stadium in 2011 has enabled them to compete at a higher level and they will also move to a new \u00a329m training ground this summer, which will enable them to improve their infrastructure and their youth academy. If Garc\u00eda leaves, then he is unlikely to be short of potential suitors. His youth, association with Barcelona and commitment to attacking, possession-based football makes him an attractive candidate. Garc\u00eda, who led Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Israeli title in the 2012-13 season after a spell coaching Barcelona&apos;s Under-19s, favours a move to the Premier League or La Liga and it is understood that West Ham, who may sack Sam Allardyce this week, and Aston Villa have both been watching his progress with interest.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-11T22:34:23Z", "title": "Brighton manager \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda offers resignation after play-off defeat", "sentences": ["Garc\u00eda, who led Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Israeli title in the 2012-13 season after a spell coaching Barcelona&apos;s Under-19s, favours a move to the Premier League or La Liga and it is understood that West Ham, who may sack Sam Allardyce this week, and Aston Villa have both been watching his progress with interest."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/11/brighton-oscar-garcia-resignation-defeat"}, {"tags": ["Cities", "World news"], "article": "It is frequently cited that more than half of us now live in cities.

Olmert, 68, and a number of codefendants were jailed after being found guilty of receiving millions of dollars from the Holyland Development Company \u2013 the developers behind the Holyland luxury real estate project in Jerusalem. The charges \u2013 which Olmert has always denied \u2013 relate to 2006, when he was mayor of Jerusalem. Olmert&apos;s lawyers are likely to appeal against Tuesday&apos;s sentence and are expected to ask the Tel Aviv court that he remain on bail until then. In a statement issued before the sentencing, the former prime minister appeared to anticipate a bad result. &quot;This is a sad day, on which a severe and unjust verdict is to be handed down to an innocent man,&quot; he said. Two years ago, Olmert was acquitted of separate corruption charges relating to his dealings with a US businessman, which had forced his resignation as prime minister in 2008. The result convinced many that the once-popular leader \u2013 a centrist remembered for his efforts to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians, but also as the architect of wars in Lebanon and Gaza in 2006 and 2008 \u2013 could re-enter politics. But those hopes were dashed at the end of his two-year trial over the &quot;Holyland affair&quot; on 31 March, when the judge found him guilty of taking $144,000 from the developers of the project and $17,000 in a separate real estate deal. Speaking in court on Tuesday, Rozen told Olmert that he had committed &quot;one of the worst crimes under law&quot; and described bribe-takers as traitors whose actions &quot;polluted civil service&quot;, local media reported from the courtroom. Nine other officials were sentenced to between three and seven years in jail on Tuesday. The former prime minister is not the first Israeli politician to find himself in court over graft charges.

The Foreign Office confirmed &quot;special mission&quot; status \u2013 effectively, diplomatic immunity \u2013 has been granted to Tzipi Livni, Israel&apos;s justice minister and lead negotiator in recent peace talks, who will meet Foreign Office ministers in London. &quot;Since the visit meets all the essential elements for a special mission, and for avoidance of any doubt on the matter, the FCO has confirmed consent to the visit as a special mission,&quot; the FCO said. The move comes amid efforts to secure a warrant for Livni&apos;s arrest by London lawyers Hickman and Rose, acting on behalf of a relative of a Palestinian killed in the bombing of a police compound on the first day of Israel&apos;s military assault on Gaza, which began in December 2008. Working with the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), the law firm requested the CPS to advise police to arrest Livni for suspected war crimes, and to liaise with the attorney general to approve criminal charges. Raji Sourani, PCHR director, said he was very disappointed at the government&apos;s decision given that a British judge decided in December 2009 that there was sufficient evidence to justify Livni&apos;s arrest over the three-week Israeli military assault on Gaza. &quot;As the lawyers for the victims of widespread suspected Israeli war crimes, PCHR is very concerned that these kind of political acts endorse the &apos;rule of the jungle&apos; rather than the &apos;rule of law&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;The [UK government&apos;s] stated policy of &apos;ending impunity for international crimes&apos; can only be properly pursued if the rule of law and due process is allowed to prevail, rather than Britain giving a safe haven to suspected war criminals, even for a few hours,&quot; Sourani said. An application on behalf of a private individual for an arrest warrant for Livni was received by the Director of Public Prosecutions last month. But on Monday the CPS was informed that Livni had been granted special mission immunity. &quot;In accordance with established case law, this means that a magistrates&apos; court would be bound to refuse any application for an arrest and as such the DPP is not able to consider any application in relation to this individual,&quot; said a CPS spokesperson. It is the second time diplomatic immunity has been granted to Livni when visiting the UK. In October 2011 she was granted special mission status after the CPS received an application for an arrest warrant for alleged war crimes. In December 2009 Livni cancelled a visit to London after an arrest warrant was issued by Westminster magistrates court. The British government later changed the law on &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; to require prior approval from the DPP before an arrest warrant in connection with international war crimes could be issued. Previously, citizens could apply directly to a judge for an arrest warrant. The granting of immunity to Livni comes amid growing concern over the government&apos;s issuing of special mission status, and the secrecy surrounding such moves. A special mission is &quot;a temporary mission, representing a state, which is sent by one state to another with the consent of the latter, in order to carry out official engagements on behalf of the sending state&quot;, the foreign secretary, William Hague, told MPs in March 2013. But the government has refused to disclose details. In response to parliamentary questions tabled by the shadow justice minister, Andy Slaughter, last month, the Foreign Office minister, Mark Simmonds, said: &quot;In view of the confidentiality of diplomatic exchanges, we have no plans to publish further details about requests that have been granted or refused.&quot; Applications took into consideration the &quot;obligations incumbent upon the UK under customary international law and our policy of ending impunity for the most serious of international crimes and a commitment to the protection of human rights,&quot; he added. Critics say the judicial system is being bypassed, and that the granting of immunity circumvents the UK&apos;s obligations under international law. The government&apos;s refusal to disclose details of special mission requests was outrageous, Slaughter said. &quot;This prevents proper public scrutiny. Diplomacy should not override the legitimate role of the courts.&quot; Last year, two other high-profile Israelis \u2013 Benny Gantz, the Israeli military chief of staff, and Doron Almog, a retired major general \u2013 were granted special mission status for visits to the UK. At the time, the PCHR said: &quot;Credible evidence exists indicating Mr Gantz&apos;s involvement in the commission of war crimes: these allegations should be investigated and, if appropriate, Mr Gantz should be prosecuted. He should not be preemptively granted immunity by the UK government, circumventing normal criminal justice procedures.&quot; Gantz was suspected of war crimes over Israel&apos;s eight-day military assault on Gaza in November 2012, according to PCHR. Almog cancelled last year&apos;s UK visit despite being granted immunity. In September 2005 the former military officer refused to disembark from a plane at Heathrow after he was tipped off that an arrest warrant had been issued by a British court. He stayed on board until the plane took off for Tel Aviv two hours later. The UK promised Israel it would change the law to make it harder to secure arrest warrants for Israeli public figures. In an address to the Israeli parliament last month, David Cameron said: &quot;When I was in opposition, I spoke out when \u2013 because of the law on universal jurisdiction \u2013 senior Israelis could not safely come to my country without fear of ideologically motivated court cases and legal stunts; when I became prime minister, I legislated to change it. My country is open to you and you are welcome to visit any time.&quot; Livni played a key role in Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli name given to its military onslaught on Gaza in 2008-09. Of around 1,400 Palestinian deaths, most were civilians according to human rights groups. Israel says 1,166 Palestinians died and that most were combatants. Thirteen Israelis were killed. Livni declined to comment on her legal status in the UK. Sarah Colborne of the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign said: &quot;It is an outrage that the British government appears to have offered Tzipi Livni immunity from prosecution for the gravest of offences \u2013 war crimes \u2026 Livni may be desperately trying to run, and hide, from justice. But she should know that you can&apos;t evade justice for war crimes \u2013 and there is no expiry date. Tzipi Livni can&apos;t rely on getting &apos;get out of jail free&apos; cards every time she travels overseas.&quot; Livni&apos;s trip to London this week coincides with a visit by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, towho will meet the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to discuss the breakdown in peace negotiations and the recent reconciliation between rival Palestinian political factions, Fatah and Hamas. The US has threatened to withhold funding from the Palestinian Authority if unity with Hamas \u2013 designated as a terrorist organisation by Washington \u2013 advances. &quot;While the door remains open to a peace process, the purpose of the meeting is to discuss our ongoing relationship with the Palestinians,&quot; the state department said on Monday. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 May 2014.

The Zionist idea and its principal political progeny are the subject of deeply divergent interpretations, not least inside the Jewish state itself. No other aspect of Zionism, however, is\u00a0more controversial than its attitude towards the indigenous population of\u00a0the land of its dreams. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of the state of Israel, famously said that it is by its treatment of the Palestinians that his country will be judged. Yet, when judged by this criterion, Zionism is not just an unqualified failure but a tragedy of historic proportions. Zionism did achieve its central goal but at a terrible price: the displacement and dispossession of the Palestinians \u2013 what the Arabs call the Nakba, the catastrophe. The authors of these two books are\u00a0both Israelis, but they approach their subject from radically different ideological vantage points. Ilan Papp\u00e9 is a scholar and a pro-Palestinian political activist. He is one of the most prominent Israeli political dissidents living in exile, having moved from the University of Haifa to the University of\u00a0Exeter. He is also one of the few Israeli students of the conflict who write about the Palestinian side with real knowledge and empathy. Papp\u00e9 places Zionism under an uncompromising lens. In his reading it was not a national liberation movement but a settler colonial project imposed on the Palestinians by force with the support of the west. From this premise it follows that the state of Israel is not legitimate even in its original borders, much less so within its post-1967 borders. To correct the injustice, Papp\u00e9 advocates a peaceful, humanist and socialist alternative to the Zionist idea in the form of a binational state with equal rights for all its citizens. Ari Shavit is a member of the editorial board of the liberal Zionist paper Ha&apos;aretz, and one of Israel&apos;s most influential columnists. He is an eloquent exponent of liberal Zionism, but he also\u00a0exemplifies its ambiguities, inner contradictions and moral myopia. Papp\u00e9 has published a large number of books on the history of Arab-Israeli conflict of which the most widely read and most controversial is The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine. The Idea of Israel is not a history book but a close study of the role of Zionist ideology in the making of modern Israel and of the continuing relevance of this ideology today in politics, the education system, the media, the cinema and Ashkenazi-Sephardi relations. The book thus offers\u00a0a broad survey\u00a0of the\u00a0main critical schools of\u00a0thought on\u00a0Israel. Two chapters deal\u00a0directly with the Palestine question: the historiography of the first Arab-Israeli war, and the uses and misuses of the Holocaust. History is usually written by the victors, and the Middle East is no exception. Papp\u00e9 himself is a leading member of the group of &quot;new&quot; or revisionist Israeli historians that emerged in the late 1980s and included Simha Flapan, Benny Morris and myself. In our different ways we all challenged the dominant narrative, the narrative of the victors. Using recently released documents we debunked many of the myths that had come to surround the birth of the state of Israel and the 1948 war. Intentionally or otherwise, our work thus lent credibility to the Palestinian historical narrative about the war for Palestine. In his new book, Papp\u00e9 deals with recent developments in the historiographical sphere, especially on the origins of the Palestinian refugee problem. The big question has always been: did they leave of their own accord or were they forced out? Israeli governments have always denied that they drove the Palestinians out. In his ground-breaking 1989 book on the subject \u2013 The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949 \u2013 Morris presented incontrovertible evidence of\u00a0Israeli involvement in creating the refugee problem. Evidence subsequently gathered by Morris points to an even higher degree of Israeli responsibility. But following the outbreak of the second intifada, Morris veered to the right and radically changed his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He concluded it was a mistake not to expel all the Palestinians from the Jewish state in 1948. Papp\u00e9 argues that the new documents prove that the expulsion of\u00a0730,000 Palestinians was\u00a0more premeditated, systematic and extensive than Morris had ever acknowledged. In\u00a0short, he claims that when war provided an opportunity, the\u00a0Zionist idea was translated into the\u00a0ethnic cleansing of Palestine. The role of the Holocaust in empowering the struggle for Jewish statehood is another sensitive issue in the debate about the past. Papp\u00e9 denounces any political manipulation of the Holocaust as a means of moral blackmail designed to silence legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. His sharpest comments are reserved for Israeli officials who have perfected such manipulation as a diplomatic tool in their struggle against the Palestinians. His deeper concern, however, is to understand the impact and significance of the Holocaust memory in constructing and marketing the idea of Israel. Israelis have harboured an exaggerated sense of themselves as victims, and this self-image, he argues, has prevented them from seeing the Palestinians in a\u00a0more realistic light, and impeded a\u00a0reasonable political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The argument that what happened to\u00a0the Palestinians was just a small injustice to rectify a\u00a0greater injustice (the destruction of European Jewry) is\u00a0rejected with some vehemence. The only hope Papp\u00e9 sees of making peace with the Arabs is for Israelis to free themselves of their Shoah mentality.     Ari Shavit is one of Israel's most influential columnists. Photograph: Sharon Bareket/Courtesy of Spiegel    Shavit&apos;s position is more conflicted and therefore more opaque. He is a\u00a0passionate but not uncritical Zionist. His book is also not a history of Israel but a series of stories of individuals and significant events that shed a\u00a0great\u00a0deal of new light on the making of the Jewish state. Among the cast of\u00a0characters on whom Shavit draws to\u00a0construct his picture of Israel are Holocaust survivors; a youth leader who helped to turn Masada into a symbol and shrine of post-Holocaust Zionism; an enigmatic engineer who was instrumental in building the atomic bomb in Dimona to defend the\u00a0Jews against the threat of a second genocide; the zealous religious Zionists\u00a0who spearheaded the settler movement; leftwing academics in Jerusalem; and pedlars of sex and drugs in Tel Aviv nightclubs. But, above all, this is a personal story. As the author explains in the introduction: &quot;This book is the personal odyssey of one Israeli who is bewildered by the historic drama engulfing his homeland. It is the journey in space and time of an\u00a0Israeli-born individual exploring the\u00a0wider narrative of his nation.&quot; The most vivid illustration of Shavit&apos;s attitude to this wider narrative is his account of the expulsion by the nascent Israeli army of 50,000-70,000 of the Arab residents of Lydda and the massacre of 70 civilians in a small mosque in\u00a0July 1948. The grisly story has been told many times before, but Shavit&apos;s reconstruction is riveting. His\u00a0original contribution consists of interviews with the Jewish brigade commander and the military governor in which they speak frankly about their strategic and moral dilemmas. Shavit refers to this episode as &quot;our black box&quot; in which lies &quot;the dark secret of Zionism&quot;. But he goes on to say that the conquest of Lydda and the expulsion of its inhabitants &quot;were an inevitable phase of the Zionist revolution that laid the foundation for the Zionist state&quot;. &quot;Lydda,&quot; he asserts, &quot;is an integral and essential part of our story.&quot; Like Morris, Shavit evidently thinks that the end justifies the means; I don&apos;t. The massacre of innocent civilians can never be justified under any circumstances. It is a heinous war crime and it\u00a0must be\u00a0denounced as such even if\u00a0the perpetrators are Jews and, yes, even if they are Holocaust survivors. Both authors engage with the essence of Zionism as well as with its more problematic parts. While Papp\u00e9 represents the cutting edge of radical anti-Zionism, Shavit exposes the dissonance, the double standards and\u00a0intellectual incoherence of liberal Zionism. Shavit, by his own acronym, is a Wasp \u2013 a White Ashkenazi Supporter of Peace. His liberal credentials were burnished by serving as chair of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel in the early 1990s. In addition, he enjoys the great advantage of writing like an\u00a0angel. The smoothness and beauty of his prose is all the more remarkable given that English is his second language. But the brilliance of Shavit&apos;s style\u00a0tends to conceal the ethnocentric character of his commentary and his inability to confront the moral consequences of the triumph of Zionism. On one thing the two authors agree: the current status quo between Israel and the Palestinians is unsustainable. Both of them see the writing on the wall. The occupation, the relentless expansion of illegal settlements, the construction of the monstrous &quot;security barrier&quot; on the West Bank, the demolition of Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem, the flagrant violations of international law, the systematic abuse of Palestinian human rights and the rampant racism \u2013 all are slowly but surely turning Israel into an international pariah. No sane Israeli relishes the prospect of living in a pariah state that maintains an apartheid regime. But\u00a0few Israelis are ready for a truly honest historical reckoning with the\u00a0people they have wronged and oppressed and whose land they continue to colonise. To blame the victims for their own misfortunes, as\u00a0the people in power habitually do, is\u00a0both disingenuous and despicable. This is no way for any nation to behave, especially one with such an acute historical memory of the bitter taste of\u00a0victimhood. \u2022 Avi Shlaim&apos;s Israel and Palestine: Reappraisals, Revisions, Refutations is published by Verso. \u2022 Ari Shavit&apos;s book My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, published by Scribe, is available from the Guardian bookshop.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-14T09:59:00Z", "title": "The Idea of Israel and My Promised Land \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Among the cast of\u00a0characters on whom Shavit draws to\u00a0construct his picture of Israel are Holocaust survivors; a youth leader who helped to turn Masada into a symbol and shrine of post-Holocaust Zionism; an enigmatic engineer who was instrumental in building the atomic bomb in Dimona to defend the\u00a0Jews against the threat of a second genocide; the zealous religious Zionists\u00a0who spearheaded the settler movement; leftwing academics in Jerusalem; and pedlars of sex and drugs in Tel Aviv nightclubs."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/idea-israel-ilan-pappe-promised-land-ari-shavit-review"}, {"tags": ["Cities", "US news", "China", "Mayoral elections", "World news", "Local politics", "Economics"], "article": "The modest city of Toledo was founded on the northern edge of the state of Ohio, in a strip of land that nearly provoked a border war between Ohio and Michigan. Over the years, it grew to become a midsized industrial powerhouse, known as \u201cGlass City\u201d for its glass-making companies, and also as the \u201cAuto Parts Capital of the World\u201d (Detroit is only 60 miles away). Like much of the Rust Belt, deindustrialisation hit Toledo hard; the local newspaper, the Toledo Blade, counts 140 factories that have closed since 2000 alone. With a population of about 300,000, Toledo is just one of many cities in the US and across the globe that flies largely under the radar. It lacks the large urbanist booster class that exists in many bigger cities. Rust Belt self-loathing remains in fashion here: a local videographer has achieved a degree of fame by posting videos to YouTube of him driving around what seems to be a mostly vacant city, with names like Only in a Dump like Toledo, or Welcome to Downtown Toledo Ohio&apos;s Fabulous Nightlife (&quot;Believe it or not, 300,000 people live here&quot;). But beyond the plant closings and the civic struggles, today Toledo is making positive global headlines for something other than shuttered malls and urban decay: for the millions of dollars in Chinese investment it is attracting.  Chinese investor groups have bought the Park Inn Hotel and Seagate Hotel downtown. Another Chinese group purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for a &quot;new urbanist&quot;-style marina, which will include a mix of residential, retail and commercial uses. Ten separate Chinese companies have established sales offices in the region. The previous mayor, Michael Bell, kicked all this off. Knowing he was unlikely to get much help from Washington in attracting investment, he decided he&apos;d go drum it up himself. He made China his city&apos;s top foreign target for investment and led several trade trips to China personally. Until recently, the Toledo/Northwest Ohio region had a full-time representative in China.     Smoke stacks at the Chrysler assembly plant in Toledo. More than 100 other factories in the area have closed down since 2000. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    Unlikely Toledo is an example of an increasing trend around the world: small cities going it alone in search of success in a globalised, urbanised age. They are increasingly finding it necessary to act more like city-states such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Dubai, directly selling themselves to global investors and potential residents. Cities, big and small, now trade not just provincially or nationally, but globally. They&apos;re also economically specialised at both the macro level (think of fashion and luxury in Paris) and the micro (the design of super-tall skyscrapers in Chicago). Migration patterns often follow city-to-city networks. Even crime is now global.  What all this means is that each city\u2019s needs are both global and particularised \u2013 and each needs to come up with its own strategy. Large cities have led the way here: S\u00e3o Paulo is focusing on diplomacy, with an &quot;office of foreign affairs&quot; and direct relationships with the US, Britain and France, aiming to tap into global networks of money, people and expertise. In New York, the police department has created its own international anti-terrorism unit with officers stationed everywhere from London to Tel Aviv and embedded at agencies such as the FBI, New Scotland Yard and Interpol. Mayors from around the world, realising they have more in common with each other than with their countries, have formed the C40 group to tackle climate issues, as national governments continue to squabble and fail to act. But the city-state model comes with risks, especially for small cities. Too narrow a focus on global economic success can open fissures at home. In Britain, a chasm is opening between London and everywhere else. Even in the capital itself there has been a massive widening of the income gap and skyrocketing housing prices, not to mention riots.  In Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities, an ill-timed raise of transit fares just as the country was pouring billions into the Olympics triggered protests. One of those cities was S\u00e3o Paulo, the &quot;leader in foreign diplomacy&quot;, forced to come to terms with the fact that its citizens were throwing Molotov cocktails because of very local issues. Global investment might be flowing into Istanbul, but try to pave Gezi Park and watch what happens. A city too focused on its role in the global economy is like a national government obsessed with military spending.     Toledo's Maumee River. Another Chinese group has purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for redevelopment as a marina. Photograph: Alamy    It can also be taken too far, to a comical extent. Rather like Toledo, three cities in Indiana \u2013 Indianapolis, Anderson and Muncie \u2013 each took independent foreign trade trips in 2013. Yet all three are part of a single economic region, and only Indianapolis probably has the scale to operate globally.  Cooperation, here, is surely more important \u2013 as was recognised by Louisville and Lexington, two smaller cities (albeit the two largest in Kentucky) that joined forces to boost manufacturing. \u201cCities need to be excellent at partnering with each other internal to the state\u201d to compete globally, says the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer. Rather than city-states proper, perhaps a better way to think about these new urban areas is \u201cmetro city-states\u201d. Toledo has smartly taken this regional approach. \u201cWe always make sure to say Northwest Ohio,\u201d says Paul Zito of the area\u2019s regional growth agency.  Nevertheless, Toledo remains a deeply troubled city. The poverty rate is high and job creation anemic. So far, the hype about the China strategy probably outstrips the reality. Chinese investment has certainly put some money in the city\u2019s coffers, but it has not yet created many jobs, and the marina remains on the drawing board. Zito says that Chinese investment in Toledo is following the pattern of Japan, with commercial real estate as only \u201cthe first wave\u201d \u2013 but the new mayor, Mike Collins, says he won\u2019t make as many personal trips as his predecessor. But while full recovery for Toledo, and a potential harvest of significant jobs from its Chinese efforts, might be a way off, the fact that foreign investors are putting money into property in the urban heart of the Rust Belt shows how small cities can carve out a place for themselves on a global scale. Nick Kubiak, a Toledo expat who was living in Detroit, decided to apply the same DIY ethic happening in Motown to his own hometown. He returned last year to open a wine bar downtown, and says declining Toledo rents actually opened the door for him and others to get in where they previously couldn&apos;t before. Though he welcomes Chinese investors, Kubiak points out that many in this blue-collar union stronghold are suspicious of foreign investment. Still, as he says: &quot;You&apos;re not going to see change in Toledo without investing a lot of money \u2013 and that has to come from somewhere.&quot; And realistically, what alternative does this small city have? In a global age, cities simply have no choice but to be in the game.

Uri Ariel, a member of the hardline Jewish Home party, which is part of Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s rightwing coalition government, predicted in a radio interview on Friday that the number of settlers could grow by 50% by 2019. The US special envoy to the Middle East peace talks, Martin Indyk, recently cited &quot;rampant settlement activity&quot; as a key factor in the breakdown of the talks last month. During the nine months of failed peacemaking, Ariel published tenders for settlement construction that were cited by the US as having contributed to the impasse by convincing the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that Netanyahu was not serious about reaching an accord. Most controversially, Ariel was accused of re-announcing an old tender to build 700 more housing units in East Jerusalem in the midst of frantic last-minute efforts to salvage the talks, condemning them to collapse. Palestinians want the West Bank as part of their future state and blamed settlement expansions for the breakdown last month of US-mediated peace talks with Israel \u2013 a position supported in part by Washington, but rejected by the Israelis. Ariel told the Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM that negotiations on Palestinian statehood were in their &quot;dying throes&quot;. &quot;I think that in five years there will be 550,000 or 600,000 Jews in Judea and Samaria, rather than 400,000 [now],&quot; he said, using a biblical term for the West Bank. About 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas which, along with the Gaza Strip, Israel captured in a 1967 war. Jewish Home opposes Palestinian statehood altogether, raising speculation in Israel that Netanyahu, in the unlikely event of a diplomatic breakthrough, would eject the party from his coalition. On Friday thousands of Palestinians turned out to bury two youths shot and killed by Israeli soldiers a day earlier during protests to commemorate the 66th anniversary of the Nakba, or &quot;catastrophe&quot; of the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians in 1948. The two youths were shot in the chest while protesting near Israel&apos;s Ofer prison, near the central West Bank city of Ramallah.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T15:13:31Z", "title": "Israeli hardliner predicts rapid settlement growth in West Bank", "sentences": ["Ariel told the Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM that negotiations on Palestinian statehood were in their &quot;dying throes&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/16/israel-uri-ariel-settlement-growth-west-bank"}, {"tags": ["Genetics", "Ageing", "Science", "Second world war"], "article": "Robin Holliday, who has died aged 81, played a key role in the early decades of the modern era of genetics and became one of the first to apply molecular science to the study of ageing. He gave his name to the Holliday junction, the molecular structure through which genetic information crosses over from one DNA helix to another during the process known as recombination. He also contributed to understanding how human cells grown in culture have limited division capacity \u2013 a form of ageing at the cellular level \u2013 and to testing ideas about the role of damage to proteins within the ageing process. Robin was also a talented writer, whose book Understanding Ageing (1995) provides a superb introduction for the general scientist. Robin was born in Jaffa, Palestine (now part of Tel Aviv, Israel), where his father, Clifford, an architect, and mother, Eunice, had been living since 1921. When Robin was nearly three, the family moved to Richmond upon Thames, Surrey, where they stayed for only a few years before sailing to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in April 1939 for what was expected to be a six-month assignment. However, the outbreak of the second world war meant that the family did not return for eight years. In 1941, they spent a year in Cape Town, South Africa, before returning to Ceylon. Then, in 1944, they sailed on a convoy to Gibraltar. This itinerant childhood left Robin with a deep love of travel. Returning to postwar austerity in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Robin finished his schooling at Hitchin grammar school, where he won a scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1952. From his later writings, it seems Robin had a difficult introduction to Cambridge where it &quot;proved hard to find congenial company&quot;. However he eventually made much-valued friends, including the young Jonathan Miller. Robin was still an undergraduate at Cambridge when in 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson made their momentous discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. In the last year of his degree, Robin heard a lecture about this discovery and its genetic implications and he decided then and there that he wanted to carry out research in genetics. Armed with a double first, Robin began postgraduate research in Cambridge, where a galaxy of stars in the new science of molecular biology was assembled and where visitors from around the world would drop by. The years of Robin&apos;s PhD research were also turbulent times politically. Robin, a committed pacifist, threw his energy into the campaign to ban nuclear weapons tests. At this time he met Diana Parsons and they married in 1957. With his PhD research done, Robin took a position at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Hertfordshire. Here he found himself thinking hard about how two DNA molecules \u2013 the chromosome pairs \u2013 with almost the same genetic information could get together to produce a cross-over. It was during a sabbatical visit in 1963 to the University of Washington, in Seattle, that Robin hit upon the idea of the &quot;Holliday junction&quot;, which he wrote about first in 1964 and refined in 1968; it was confirmed experimentally by David Dressler and Hunt Potter in 1976. In 1965, Robin was appointed to a position at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, where he would form and lead the genetics division. He continued his work on recombination and during the 1970s he also suggested that chemical modifications to the DNA helix, known as methylation, might have important effects on how the genome plays out its instructions. Such a mechanism now underpins the field of epigenetics. When Robin joined the NIMR, the director was Sir Peter Medawar, a Nobel prize-winning immunologist also known for his scientific interest in ageing. Robin was fascinated by the question of how cells might age and rapidly developed a strong interest in this topic. As a scientist who delighted in the interplay between theory and experiments, Robin became uneasy when in the 1980s biological research became much more empirical. This put him somewhat at odds with the new scientific establishment. Meanwhile changes in his life \u2013 the dissolution of his marriage to Diana and his eventual remarriage, to Lily Huschtscha \u2013 led Robin to take a position in 1988 with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Sydney. He was also a talented sculptor and two of his bronze works are at the Royal Society in London, where he was elected fellow in 1976 and honoured with a Royal Medal in 2011. At the time of his death Robin was working to prepare a paper for a conference marking 50 years of the Holliday junction. Robin is survived by Lily and their daughter, Mira; by the children, David, Caroline, Rebecca and Emma, of his first marriage; and by 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild. \u2022 Robin Holliday, geneticist, writer and sculptor, born 6 November 1932; died 9 April 2014", "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T14:47:54Z", "title": "Robin Holliday obituary", "sentences": ["Robin was born in Jaffa, Palestine (now part of Tel Aviv, Israel), where his father, Clifford, an architect, and mother, Eunice, had been living since 1921."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/may/20/robin-holliday"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli human rights group B&apos;Tselem has concluded that footage capturing the moment two Palestinian teenagers were shot dead by Israeli soldiers despite posing no risk to them is &quot;genuine and consistent&quot;, contradicting Israeli army claims that the footage is likely to have been forged. A short section of edited CCTV footage was released earlier this week showing Nadim Nawara, 17, and Mohammad Salameh, 16, being shot and killed. Since then Israeli military sources have been quoted anonymously on several occasions in the local media trying to undermine the tape&apos;s credibility. The two boys were killed on Thursday last week during a rally involving stone-throwing outside Ofer prison on the West Bank on &quot;Nakba Day&quot;, when Palestinians mark the mass displacement that occurred during the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948.           When footage from CCTV cameras installed on a business close to the shootings was first circulated on Monday evening by the group Defence for Children International \u2013 Palestine, senior Israeli army sources suggested it had been edited in a &quot;biased&quot; and &quot;tendentious&quot; way. By Thursday morning army sources were being quoted in Haaretz claiming either that the tape was a forgery or that an unknown Palestinian gunmen had killed the two youths and badly injured another. The emergence of the CCTV footage this week, showing the moment of the pair&apos;s deaths, sparked international controversy as it sharply contradicted the initial Israeli police and military accounts of the day, which insisted no live ammunition had been used and the boys had died in the midst of violent clashes that had threatened the lives of soldiers. Senior US and UN officials are among those who have called for a full inquiry, while the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has also raised his concern. Several journalists from international news organisations were at the demonstration outside Ofer prison when the incident occurred, including CNN and a photographer for Agence France-Presse, Abbas Momani, whose still photographs appear to duplicate action from the CCTV images. The full CCTV footage \u2013 amounting to hours of tape \u2013 was reviewed and logged by researchers for B&apos;Tselem, which has provided copies to Israeli military police and planned to release more of the footage. Invited by the Guardian to provide evidence the footage was faked, a senior Israeli military spokesman on Thursday would only say it had been edited to &quot;misrepresent the extensive Palestinian violence that day&quot;, adding that the army&apos;s investigation was ongoing. Sarit Michaeli of B&apos;Tselem said on Thursday that researchers had now reviewed all the CCTV footage taken from the four cameras installed at the scene of the killings, showing several different angles. They concluded that the edited footage was consistent with the sequence of events as it was captured on the full-length tapes. Michaeli said: &quot;The footage is continuous, as you can see from the time stamps. &quot;It starts just before midday and finishes around three. Taken together it shows that there is a light demonstration with some stoning. Soldiers fire rubber bullets and teargas until the fatal shootings. Then you see the youths get shot and fall.&quot; Footage shot by CNN of the killings appears to confirm this picture, showing Nadim Nawara throwing stones at one stage close to the building where he was shot and killed, but still at some distance from where witnesses have placed the closest Israeli soldiers. Whether violence took place earlier or not, Israeli open fire regulations are unequivocal in stating that it is only permissible to use live rounds \u2013 or lethal force \u2013 against stone-throwers when there is an immediate risk to life. Neither of the youths was throwing stones when they were killed, and one was walking away from the Israeli position, with his back to soldiers, when he was shot. The wounds to the two boys and another boy who survived being shot appear consistent with small-calibre, high-velocity live rounds, including the described entry and exit wounds and the way the bullets travelled in the body. Commenting on efforts to cast doubt on accounts of the affair in +972 online magazine, Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion analyst in Tel Aviv, attempted to explain recent comments: &quot;Public figures are well aware that the postmodern mindset makes it hard to pin down facts. &quot;Throwing out theories, no matter how wild, raises doubts even if far-fetched. Using words inaccurately, or not admitting to one&apos;s actions is another form.

On Saturday, in the Phoenix Centre, a modern community hall on the outskirts of the Deheisheh camp, Francis will sit with children from Palestinian refugee families. They will sing to him, show him their pictures and receive a blessing. After barely 15 minutes he will be whisked away on the next leg of his three-day tour of Jordan, Palestine and Israel. The walls have been hung with giant composite pictures \u2013 archive images of the displacement of Palestinian refugees in 1948 merged with pictures documenting the changing Palestinian landscape until the present day. Walls in streets across Bethlehem, through which the Pope will drive in an ordinary, non-bulletproof car, carry images from the same project, comparing the Palestinian experience to the suffering of Jesus. The point of these pictures, curator and director of Jack Persekian explained to the Guardian, is to emphasise to the pope the continuity of Palestinian experience since 1948. In Israel, banners welcoming the pontiff hang from west Jerusalem lampposts. Almost 9,000 police have been drafted in to protect Francis. A handful of Jewish religious radicals who it had been feared might try to disrupt the visit have been placed under administrative orders, and roads and some checkpoints to the West Bank will be sealed. The Vatican has insisted that the purpose of his visit is primarily religious \u2013 to mark the anniversary of the meeting 50 years ago between Pope Paul VI and the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, Patriarch Athenagoras \u2013 and &quot;absolutely not political&quot;. But the symbolism engrained in the political landscape Israel and Palestine \u2013 both religious and secular \u2013 has been impossible to avoid. Here are some of the political spectres hanging over his tour. Visit to the &apos;State of Palestine&apos; The Vatican and Palestine are both non-voting observer nations in the UN&apos;s general assembly, but it has been noted by some as significant that the Vatican&apos;s own schedule for the visit refers to Mahmoud Abbas as &quot;president of the State of Palestine&quot;. Ten months of meetings between the Palestinian Authority and the Vatican over a deal expected to be signed this year on the Catholic church&apos;s status in areas governed by the Palestinian Authority have also been treated as negotiations between sovereign states. Vatican spokesman Rev Federico Lombardi has said that the use of &quot;state of Palestine&quot; reflects the UN general assembly&apos;s 2012 resolution upgrading Palestine&apos;s status, although it has irritated Israeli officials. Arrival at Bethlehem heliport On the highest hill overlooking the town, the rarely used facility was built in 1995. Both Israeli settlement building and sections of the Israeli separation wall are visible from the landing pad. Phoenix Centre The pope insisted on meeting &quot;ordinary people&quot;. The children chosen are from &quot;families with someone who was martyred, injured or jailed \u2212 and also some ordinary people as well&quot;, said the centre&apos;s director, Mamoun Lahham. Each child will wear a T-shirt with the name of the village the family was originally displaced from. The wall After negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Vatican, Francis&apos;s route through Bethlehem will take him within a few metres of an imposing section of the Israeli separation wall that now cuts the old road from Jerusalem to Hebron near Rachel&apos;s Tomb. At this point there will be refugees from two camps lining either side of the road. The routing will create a photo opportunity that places Francis against the backdrop of one of the most visible signs of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Mass in Manger Square Unlike his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, the only large-scale open mass of the visit \u2013 for some 9,000 people \u2013 will be in Manger Square, Bethlehem. Because of the security operation surrounding Francis while he is in Jerusalem, Palestinian Christians in the city have expressed their disappointment that they are unlikely to encounter him. Meetings with Israeli officials Francis will meet Mahmoud Abbas in the presidential compound in Bethlehem,but his official meetings with Israeli political leaders have been arranged to avoid the contentious international status of occupied East Jerusalem. He will be officially welcomed to Israel by President Shimon Peres after flying by helicopter to Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv from Bethlehem. His private meeting with the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will be at the Notre Dame centre in Jerusalem, which is Vatican sovereign territory. Mass in the Cenacle For a minority of Jewish religious extremists, the most controversial part of the trip will be a visit to the Cenacle \u2013 or the &quot;room of the Last Supper&quot; \u2013 in Jerusalem. Located on the second floor of a stone complex on the remains of a Byzantine church in the Old City, before the Ottoman period the building was administered by the pope&apos;s own Franciscan order until the mid-16th century. The place is also regarded as sacred by Muslims and by Jews who say it is the site of the Tomb of King David. It has been the focus of two decades of negotiations between the Vatican and Israel over religious access as Christians are permitted to visit and pray there but not usually celebrate mass. Following rumours \u2013 denied by the Israeli authorities \u2013 that Israel planned to hand the site to the Vatican, and fearing disturbance by Jewish hardline youth to the visit, Israeli police have placed around a dozen under administrative orders. The Pope&apos;s delegation Underlining the interfaith and ecumenical nature of the short visit, the pope&apos;s delegation includes a rabbi and a Muslim cleric and he will meet the grand mufti of Jerusalem and the two chief rabbis. Francis will visit sites regarded as holy to the three main monotheistic religions: the Western Wall, al-Aqsa mosque and the churches of the Nativity and Holy Sepulchre. This has led to some complaints from Catholic and Christian faithful that there is too much emphasis on inter-faith relations and not enough on the local faithful. Visit to Yad Vashem and Mount Herzl Like all heads of state who visit Israel, Pope Francis will visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem.

For Liverpool, five times winners who have spent the past five seasons either knocking around in the Europa League or out of continental competition altogether, watching this year\u2019s final will simply whet the appetite. There is an interesting trend that links three clubs returning to the Champions League next season after a break. Liverpool, Roma and Monaco all qualified by making eye-catching inroads in their domestic competitions while they were free of any European distractions. None of them played any overseas football at all this past season. This left them to concentrate more intensely on their gameplan, on progressing a way of playing, on invigorating their style. They benefited from the luxury of being able to train creatively and with continuity. It is a pattern of which some top coaches would be enviable, even though competing in the best competition plus a serene training schedule is a sum that unfortunately won\u2019t add up. Obviously no manager of a Champions League club would ever get away with expressing any wistfulness observing the work of teams who are not dining out in Europe but all top developmental coaches would welcome more practice time. The squeeze on the timetable that becomes cluttered by the extra preparation, travel and recovery that European football demands, leaves much less time for the most rewarding work. It does not feel like a coincidence that two of the teams whose style took off last season were Liverpool in the Premier League and Roma in Serie A. The Anfield attack ignited by Brendan Rodgers, which made sparks fly when Luis Su\u00e1rez, Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and company set off into enemy territory, has the potential to scare any opposing defence (but let\u2019s not get so far ahead of ourselves to ponder any potential knockout matches against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea just yet). Roma\u2019s revival was even more unexpected. Last summer the club sold off their two top scorers, Pablo Osvaldo and Erik Lamela, as well as their highly rated defensive shield Marquinhos, and they recruited a new head coach whose name meant little in calcio. Rumour has it that the midfielder Daniele di Rossi had to Google Rudi Garcia\u2019s name and was somewhat bewildered to see videos of his new boss playing the guitar. The Frenchman Garcia has inspired a new style, the players signed up for it wholeheartedly, and Roma chased valiantly for a scudetto that Juventus won powerfully in the end. At the start of the season Garcia, rather like Rodgers, targeted a return to European football as a primary aspiration. The Frenchman hoped for the Champions League but would have taken the Europa League as a symbol of progress. Roma have outstripped expectations, winning not only points but a lot of friends for their bravura. Miralem Pjanic, the Bosnian playmaker, had a fine season, Gervinho rediscovered his mojo, and Francesco Totti continues to delight at the age of 37. Monaco\u2019s last appearance in the Champions League came almost a decade ago, the season after they reached the final only to be outmanoeuvred by Mourinho\u2019s Porto. The club have been on an upward curve in that they qualified to rejoin Europe\u2019s finest straight after being promoted to Ligue 1. However, in terms of their style, it was not the most dazzling campaign. Claudio Ranieri knew that this was a situation comparable to his last at Chelsea, when it was obvious he was keeping the seat warm and preparing the team as best he could for someone else to waltz in and take the project on. Despite having two coveted Colombians in Radamel Falcao (for half a season until his injury) and James Rodr\u00edguez, and the Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, there is something unbalanced about the current Monaco collective. They are not as free-flowing as was expected. With Ranieri fired, the owner, Dmitry Rybolovlev, expects greater things from the next incumbent. Naturally the wealthiest are the ones who seem to carry an extra expectation from within that they should make a Champions League impression. Manchester City, who reached the first knock out phase, and Paris Saint-Germain, who slipped out at the quarter-finals, are both under pressure to make more of an impact next season. Juventus, too, are obliged to fly the Italian flag with more fortitude. Last time round they fell at the group stage, with Galatasaray advancing in their place. Among the less fancied clubs who need a play-off to make sure of their participation, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas will be hoping to make a positive impression with Zenit St Petersburg. Athletic Bilbao have the chance to return to the Champions League stage for the first time in 16 years, which would be a remarkable achievement for a club with a regionalist policy. Indeed, although their coach, Ernesto Valverde, was born outside the Basque country, he qualified to turn out for the team during his playing career as he moved there as an infant. Arsenal, too, will be preparing for another play-off, to ensure their 18th successive shot at Europe\u2019s grandest prize \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger knows all there is to know about the complications

The blinds on the stone houses are drawn and there&apos;s not a person to be seen wandering the few streets that make up Castrillo Matajud\u00edos. It&apos;s a sharp contrast to the noisy, relentless chatter about the place in the outside world. Ever since the mayor announced his intention to hold a referendum on changing its name, the spotlight has been on this Spanish village near the northern city of Burgos. Hundreds of media outlets around the world have shared its story. Thousands have taken to social media to opine on the name change. And come Sunday evening, when journalists are expected to outnumber residents at the announcement of the referendum result, millions around the world will hear about the outcome. For 400 years, this place has borne the name of Castrillo Matajud\u00edos, or Fort Kill the Jews in English. Starting at 9am on Sunday, the village&apos;s 56 residents will have the chance to decide whether the time has come to change the name to Castrillo Mota de Jud\u00edos, or Hill of Jews. &quot;We had no idea that this would be something that would gain worldwide attention,&quot; said Lorenzo Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, mayor of Castrillo Matajud\u00edos. Residents will walk to the sandstone town hall and cast their vote in the shadow of the village&apos;s coat of arms and flag, both of which prominently feature the Star of David, hinting at the complex relationship this village has had with the Jewish people during its 1,000-year existence. It was a relationship, said the mayor, that rendered the current name nonsensical. &quot;We can&apos;t carry a name that suggests we kill Jewish people when we&apos;re completely the opposite; this is a community that sprang from Jewish roots and its descendants are the descendants of Jewish people,&quot; he said. No one knows exactly how a village of people with Jewish roots ended up having a name that suggests the opposite. The name Matajud\u00edos first turned up in municipal documents in 1623, said archaeologist \u00c1ngel Palomino who, in preparation for the referendum, recently gave residents a presentation on the history of the name. Before that, the village was listed as Castrillo de Jud\u00edos, Fort of the Jews. The settlement is thought to have been founded in 1035 by a group of Jews who were expelled from a nearby village. It soon became a thriving trading hub and home to more than 1,000 residents, thanks to its strategic location along the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. The village probably remained predominantly Jewish until 1492, when Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand expelled the Jews from Spain. With the threat of religious persecution hovering over what was then a prosperous Jewish town, the name was changed, an ideological decision meant to clearly mark the boundaries between the Jews who had left Spain and those who had converted to Christianity in order to stay. &quot;They probably wanted to avoid the stigma that at the time came with the name Fort of the Jews,&quot; said Palomino. Many villagers have their own theories about how the town&apos;s name came to be. The mayor believes the town used to be named Mota de Jud\u00edos. &quot;In the 16th and 17th century, there was so much pressure on converted Jews and someone changed one letter around the 16th century and the name stuck.&quot; If the referendum was successful, he argued, the village would simply be returning to its original name. The vote would be a decisive moment in the town&apos;s history, he said, as it would also serve as a barometer of the willingness of the villagers to confront their past. If the name-change is passed, he hopes to start probing the village&apos;s Jewish past, perhaps even searching for the remains of its synagogue and other evidence of Jewish people who once lived here. Weary of their status as international media darlings for all the wrong reasons, residents were willing to talk about the vote but not one would give their name. &quot;We&apos;re not racists. News of the name change has travelled around the world, all the way to Poland even, now everyone thinks we did something wrong,&quot; said one elderly man, shaking his head. He was firmly against what he described as sanitising history for the sake of political correctness. The outside world, he said, gesturing to the hills that surround the village, seemed bent on changing the villagers&apos; relationship with their past. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible idea. Just terrible. It&apos;s always been Castrillo Matajud\u00edos and always will be for me.&quot; Another resident rooted his opposition in demographics. This once-flourishing town was now a dying village, he said. &quot;Ninety percent of the people here are over 80 years old. For what&apos;s left of the life of the village, why not let it keep its name? So many people here are proud of where they come from, why change it?&quot; In a country where names such as killer of Moors (Matamoros)\u2013 a reference to the Muslims who for centuries occupied much of Spain \u2013 were common, he worried about the precedent that would be set by the name change. &quot;What&apos;s next? Are we going to change every name in the country that might offend someone?&quot; Other villagers were more open to the idea. One pair of brothers in their 60s recalled their embarrassment at being asked to show their residency cards in Madrid during a trip to the capital for medical treatment. &quot;People were asking us, that&apos;s where they kill Jews?&quot; The eldest brother added: &quot;It would probably be easier for everyone if the name was changed.&quot; With just one day left before the vote, many residents were unsure if they were going to even bother to cast a ballot. &quot;It feels like they&apos;ve already decided,&quot; said one elderly woman as she carried her laundry into her house. The change is part of an eight-year project led by the mayor to study the Jewish roots of the village. If residents voted against it on Sunday, said Rodr\u00edguez, he would have no choice but to resign. &quot;It would only make sense to leave the job to someone who wants to continue to work under the name of Matajud\u00edos.&quot; The mayor said he had received thousands of emails and letters since announcing the referendum in April. &quot;We got all sorts of reactions. Some people insulted us, others begged us to change.&quot; The village also received a midnight visit from an extreme rightwing group, who plastered the dozen or so houses with signs and graffiti urging residents to respect its history and keep its name. The referendum is set against a backdrop of a wider struggle in Spain to come to terms with its Jewish past and present. In February this year, the Spanish government announced it wanted to &quot;correct a historical wrong&quot; by offering nationality to the descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. But all is not rosy when it comes to Spaniards&apos; relationship with the Jewish people; last week Jewish organisations in Spain asked prosecutors to investigate some 18,000 allegedly antisemitic tweets after Israel&apos;s Maccabi Tel Aviv beat Real Madrid in a basketball game. Citing tweets that referred to gas chambers and praised Hitler, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League noted that &quot;the sheer number and intensity of antisemitic hatred unleashed via Twitter in Spain is alarming and outrageous&quot;. Mayor Rodr\u00edguez wants his village to become one that shows off its Jewish roots rather than continuing to hide behind a name. But first he has to get the residents to say yes. With just hours left before voting began, he had just one demand. &quot;After all the worldwide attention \u2013 and all the people opining on social media \u2013 I&apos;m just asking one thing,&quot; he said, his voice firm. &quot;We want people to respect the residents&apos; decision. Outsiders can have their opinions but at the end of the day these 56 people have the final say in how their village is named.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-24T20:02:06Z", "title": "Castrillio Matajud\u00edos: Why Spain's quest to leave racism in the past could be decided by 56 villagers", "sentences": ["But all is not rosy when it comes to Spaniards&apos; relationship with the Jewish people; last week Jewish organisations in Spain asked prosecutors to investigate some 18,000 allegedly antisemitic tweets after Israel&apos;s Maccabi Tel Aviv beat Real Madrid in a basketball game."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/24/castrillo-matajudios-spain-villagers-vote-spain-racism"}, {"tags": ["Belgium", "Europe", "Judaism", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "Fears of a resurgence in violent antisemitism were raised after an attack at a Jewish museum in the centre of Brussels on Saturday left three people dead and one badly injured. The attack, on the eve of federal, regional and European parliamentary elections, prompted Belgium to heighten its terror alert level and increase protection at Jewish buildings and the Israeli embassy. Israel said two of the victims were a couple in their 50s from Tel Aviv. Speaking at the scene of the attack, Jo\u00eblle Milquet, the Belgian interior minister, said it was too early to say whether it was an antisemitic attack but the target suggested &quot;there are strong grounds for presuming so&quot;. Belgium&apos;s prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, made an announcement expressing support for the Jewish community. &quot;All Belgians are united,&quot; he said. Police arrested one suspect and were looking for a second. Witnesses said two people were seen getting out of car parked near the museum. A gunman then opened fire, shooting indiscriminately before getting away. A bystander, Alain Sobotik, said he saw the corpses of a woman and a man just inside the doors of the museum. Didier Reynders, Belgium&apos;s foreign minister, was at the scene shortly after the shooting. He said he saw people fleeing and heard shots. He then saw &quot;bodies on the ground in pools of blood&quot; and called emergency services. &quot;It seems that a car was double-parked and that a person went in and came out of the museum after shots were fired,&quot; Reynders said. &quot;You can&apos;t help thinking, when you see a Jewish museum, to think about an antisemitic act, but the investigation will tell more.&quot; One witness managed to see the licence plate of the vehicle used in the attack, according to Reynders. The minister later wrote on Twitter: &quot;I am shocked by the murders committed at the Jewish museum, I am thinking of the victims I saw there and their families.&quot; About 40,000 Jews live in Belgium, half of whom reside in Brussels. According to Viviane Teitelbaum, a member of the Brussels legislature, antisemitic attacks reached a peak in the early 1980s but dropped off before a recent rise in anti-Jewish sentiment. &quot;It has been a very difficult place to live&quot; for Jews, she said, adding that many young people are leaving the country. Belgian Jewish community leader Joel Rubinfeld said the attack was clearly &quot;a terrorist act&quot; and the result of &quot;a climate of hate&quot;. He said the museum had received no recent threats and that its staff &quot;are in shock&quot;.The Jewish Museum of Belgium is located in the fashionable Sablon district in the centre of Brussels, a popular haunt for shoppers and tourists.

Head bowed in prayer, the leader of the Catholic church pressed his palm against the graffiti-covered concrete of Israel&apos;s imposing &quot;separation wall&quot;, a Palestinian girl holding a flag by his side. It was, as his aides conceded later, a silent statement against a symbol of division and conflict. The powerful gesture was made minutes after an appeal to both sides to end a conflict that the pope said was &quot;increasingly unacceptable&quot;. The unscheduled, conspicuous stop halfway through his three-day visit to the Holy Land \u2013 made en route to an open-air mass in Manger Square, Bethlehem \u2013 confirmed Francis&apos;s reputation for determined independence.

It has become an emblem of the Israeli occupation. The pope&apos;s scheduled route took him alongside the wall, near Rachel&apos;s Tomb outside Bethlehem. His decision to step out of his white, open-sided popemobile and approach it \u2013 just days after the Vatican insisted his visit would not be controversial \u2013 was a surprise, not least for members of his own entourage. Surrounded by Palestinian children, Francis&apos;s progress towards the concrete barrier was followed carefully by photographers and television cameras, as well as Israeli soldiers revealed in silhouette at the window of a nearby watchtower. &quot;I know all about this,&quot; he is reported to have told one Palestinian official. The Vatican&apos;s spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, said afterwards: &quot;I was not informed [of his plans to stop]. It was planned by him the day before \u2026 It was a very significant way to demonstrate his participation in suffering \u2026 It was a profound spiritual moment in front of a symbol of division.&quot;     Pope Francis touches the wall that divides Israel from the West Bank, on his way to celebrate a mass in Manger Square. Photograph: AP    Despite attempts by the Vatican to insist the visit was &quot;purely religious&quot;, it has been loaded with political significance since Francis&apos;s arrival in a convoy of Jordanian military helicopters from Amman. While other popes might fly into Tel Aviv and proceed through Israel into Palestinian territory, Francis elected to bypass all Israeli border points. In a carefully worded statement, delivered with Abbas in Bethlehem on Sunday, Francis referred directly to &quot;the state of Palestine&quot; and called on both sides to summon the courage to forge peace. &quot;For decades the Middle East has known the tragic consequences of a protracted conflict which has inflicted many wounds so difficult to heal,&quot; the pontiff declared. The situation, he said, had become &quot;increasingly unacceptable&quot;.     Francis leads an open air mass in Manger Square. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;Even in the absence of violence, the climate of instability and a lack of mutual understanding have produced insecurity, the violation of rights, isolation and the flight of entire communities, conflicts, shortages and sufferings of every sort.&quot; Francis proceeded from the separation wall to Manger Square in Bethlehem, which was packed with thousands of Palestinian Christians waiting for him to say mass. He entered the square \u2013 the reputed site of Christ&apos;s birth \u2013 to calls of &quot;Viva al-Baba!&quot; \u2013 or &quot;Long live the pope!&quot; The service began with a rendition of the Palestinian song Mawatani \u2013 My Homeland \u2013 that speaks to the Palestinian desire for independence. The singers&apos; voices echoed across a plaza hung with images linking Christ&apos;s suffering to that of the Palestinian people. The altar from which Francis delivered his message showed a baby Jesus wrapped in a\u00a0keffiyeh, the traditional Arabic scarf that is a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. Francis ate lunch with five families in a community centre on the edge of Deheishe refugee camp before flying out of Bethlehem into Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport, where he was officially welcomed to Israel by Peres. The helicopter flight meant Francis avoided crossing through the separation wall via a checkpoint as his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had done. At Ben Gurion, Peres welcomed Francis, saying: &quot;On behalf of the Jewish people and in the name of all the people of Israel, I welcome you with the age-old words from the Book of Psalms: &apos;Welcome in the name of the Lord.&apos; Welcome at the gates of Jerusalem.&quot; Here, Francis once again diverted from his prepared script. In Tel Aviv, the pope deplored an attack on a Jewish museum in Brussels on Saturday that left four dead, which he described as &quot;this criminal act of antisemitic hatred&quot;. He added: &quot;With a deeply pained heart, I think of those who have lost their lives in the cruel attack that occurred yesterday in Brussels.&quot; While in Israel the pope will visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem, lay a wreath at the grave of the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, and meet the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew.     The pontiff visits Israel's separation barrier in Bethlehem. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    Francis will visit the holiest Christian sites in Jerusalem \u2013 including the Room of the Last Supper and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre \u2013 amid a long-term decline in the population of Palestinian Christians in the Holy Land. A survey conducted by Near East Consulting and released in April found that two-thirds of Palestinian Christians would like to emigrate. Israeli authorities have imposed tight security measures during his visit, deploying an extra 8,000 police officers. Restrictions on movement throughout the city have prompted some Christians to complain they will have little chance of seeing Francis. Some of the security has been prompted by the pope&apos;s plan to celebrate mass at the Room of the Last Supper \u2013 or &quot;Cenacle&quot; \u2013 which has angered some Jewish religious hardliners who venerate the site as the tomb of King David. Twenty-six people were arrested after stones were thrown at police close to the site.

On his way back from a high-profile, three-day trip to the Middle East, the Argentinian pontiff told journalists on board the papal plane that sex abuse was &quot;an ugly crime&quot;. &quot;It is like a satanic mass,&quot; he is reported to have said. &quot;We must go ahead with zero tolerance.&quot; Echoing a similar move made by his predecessor Benedict XVI in 2010, Francis said he would meet with eight victims of sex abuse at the Vatican early next month. They would also attend mass at the Vatican guesthouse where he lives, he said. Though applauded for his reform agenda in other areas, Francis has been accused by abuse victims of failing to grasp the deep changes they say are needed to prevent further cases and properly punish perpetrators not only of the abuse itself but of its cover-up. Francis has made the personal touch a trademark of his papacy \u2013 communicating a warmth and understanding to ordinary people that his predecessor rarely managed \u2013 but victims of abuse by officials in the Roman Catholic church have repeatedly chided him for failing to express more empathy. They reacted with particular annoyance to an interview that Francis gave to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in March, in which he defended the church&apos;s handling of the crisis and said no other institution in the world had &quot;done more&quot; to stamp out child abuse. On Tuesday, news of the pope&apos;s planned meeting with victims appeared to have done little to change the mind of David Clohessy, executive director of the main US victims&apos; group, Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (Snap). &quot;The simple truth is this is another gesture, another public relations coup, another nice bit of symbolism that will leave no child better off and bring no real reform to a continuing, scandal-ridden church hierarchy,&quot; he told the Associated Press. Clohessy said the meeting was &quot;just utterly, utterly meaningless.&quot; He has been equally damning of Francis&apos;s other major contribution to the church&apos;s efforts to improve its record: the establishment in December of a commission of experts, including an Irish victim of abuse, Marie Collins, to look at ways of better protecting minors. Not everyone was as dismissive of the meeting, which is being organised by Cardinal Sean O&apos;Malley of Boston, the US city shaken by abuse revelations in 2002. Mitchell Garabedian, a local attorney who represents victims, told the AP that a face-to-face encounter with victims was &quot;the most powerful tool that the pope can use in understanding the ugliness and horror of clergy sexual abuse and why it must be stopped or prevented&quot;. He hoped, however, that there would be more than just one meeting, and that it would prove &quot;substantive and meaningful&quot;. During his 40-minute exchange with journalists on the flight back to Rome from Tel Aviv, Francis also revealed that three bishops were currently under investigation by the Vatican for abuse-related reasons. It was not clear whether they were accused of committing abuse or having covered it up. During Francis&apos;s papacy, a new dynamic has formed in the debate around the church&apos;s handling of the sex abuse scandal, with two United Nations human-rights panels criticising the Vatican&apos;s actions and urging it to do more. The latest of these came last week, when the United Nations Committee Against Torture (Cat) produced its concluding observations on the Holy See, calling on it, among other recommendations, to place &quot;meaningful sanctions&quot; on clerics who fail to deal properly with credible allegations against priests. The Vatican disputed much of the report&apos;s legitimacy, but said it would &quot;give serious consideration&quot; to the recommendations.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T15:32:06Z", "title": "Pope's meeting with abuse victims is meaningless, says US advocacy group", "sentences": ["During his 40-minute exchange with journalists on the flight back to Rome from Tel Aviv, Francis also revealed that three bishops were currently under investigation by the Vatican for abuse-related reasons."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/pope-francis-call-for-meeting-with-clerical-sex-abuse-victims-meaningless-us-advocacy-group"}, {"tags": ["Belgium", "Europe", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Belgian police are investigating whether the killing of three people, including an Israeli couple, at the Jewish museum in Brussels on Saturday was a targeted assassination or a random antisemitic attack.

The Haaretz newspaper speculated that they may have been murdered because of connections to Israel&apos;s secret services. The Rivas&apos; teenage daughters and 200 other mourners at the ceremony listened as the Belgian ambassador to Israel, John Cornet d&apos;Elzius, promised that every effort would be made to track down their killer. He said the Belgian government would &quot;oppose antisemitism in our society&quot; \u2013 apparently a response to critical comments made by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Belgian police were reported to be investigating all possible scenarios, including a &quot;targeted assassination&quot; as well as an act of antisemitism. The third fatality was a Frenchwoman, and a young Belgian man remains critically ill. Experts in Israel and elsewhere have said the manner of the killings suggested planning and execution by a trained specialist. On Sunday, Belgian police released a 30-second video clip from the museum&apos;s security cameras showing a man wearing a dark cap, sunglasses and a blue jacket enter the building, take a Kalashnikov rifle out of a bag, and shoot into a room before calmly walking away.

Dressed in jeans, hoodies and trainers; they slouched in their seats, lanky legs stretching halfway across the carriage, joking around, rolling an empty water bottle between their feet. Nearby, another passenger was visibly irritated. He was perhaps 10 or 15 years older, wearing a neat beard, sunglasses, shorts and a faded t-shirt \u2013 and drumming his fingers on the magazine of a battered assault rifle lying across his lap. The man was Israeli, possibly from the settlement of Pisgat Ze&apos;ev where he had boarded the train. The boys were Palestinian, most likely from Beit Hanina, an Arab neighbourhood. From opposing sides of one of the world&apos;s most enduring conflicts \u2013 and the city at its epicentre \u2013 the young man and the teenagers eyeballed each other for 10 uneasy minutes until the boys spilled out of the carriage, laughing and giving the finger as they went. Provocative behaviour, a machine gun, a city built on tension and conflict \u2013 this was a potentially explosive mix. But it passed. What can a train ride tell you about a city? Quite a lot in Jerusalem, where the light railway has, following almost a decade of construction chaos, been running since August 2011. Looking out of the sleek glass and steel carriages, you can trace some of the complex and troubled history of the place; looking inside gives you a snapshot of the city&apos;s population in rare proximity. There are few places where the distinct tribes of Jerusalem mingle: the main hospital, the shopping mall, the Biblical zoo, sometimes even at McDonalds. Latterly, there has also been the light railway. The different groups rarely interact, or even make eye contact, but they attain an uneasy co-existence. Men dressed in ultra-orthodox monochrome, under hats and coats even in the Middle Eastern summer, squeeze on board, averting their eyes from young women tourists in shorts and skimpy t-shirts. Religious Jewish mothers, hair bound in long winding scarves, with a brood of small children clutching at their ankle-length skirts, stand alongside Palestinian women in skinny jeans and elaborate hijabs framing carefully made-up faces and groomed eyebrows.     A Muslim in traditional robes walks by the light rail as it passes the Old City walls in East Jerusalem. Photograph: Jim Hollander/EPA    Israeli soldiers in uniform, some armed with guns and all apparently armed with smart phones, lounge on seats opposite Palestinian labourers heading for jobs in Jewish areas of the city. Christian pilgrims en route to Via Dolorosa and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Jesus&apos;s crucifixion, mingle with Muslims heading to the sacred Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque, and Jews intent on praying at the revered Western Wall, the last surviving remnant of the Second Temple. The clang of an approaching train&apos;s warning to pedestrians to get off the open tracks has become part of the city&apos;s soundtrack, along with the constant honking of car horns, the five-times-a-day Muslim call to prayer, the occasional peal of church bells and the Friday afternoon siren that marks the start of the Jewish sabbath. Construction began on the city\u2019s new railway back in 2002 but was dogged by delays (in part because of the city\u2019s archaeological sensitivities), arguments over its route, and budget overruns. It finally opened in 2011 amid Israeli fears that the railway would become a target for terrorism, and Palestinian claims that it was part of a plan to consolidate Jewish control over the city. Israel seized the Arab eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967 six-day war, later annexing it in a move deemed illegal under international law. It declared that the city \u2013 whose eastern sector the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state \u2013 was henceforth \u201cindivisible\u201d. The following year, a \u201cmasterplan\u201d was published, which stated its \u201cfirst and cardinal rule was to ensure [Jerusalem&apos;s] unification \u2026 to build the city in a manner that would prevent the possibility of its being repartitioned.\u201d Over the ensuing 46 years, Israel has established numerous Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem to fulfil this aim. A network of roads has been constructed to connect them to the city centre; the light railway, once complete, will perform a similar purpose. Its route \u2013 a single line at present \u2013 takes passengers on a political and historical, as well as physical, journey. One end starts in the south-west of the city, close to Yad Vashem, Israel&apos;s haunting national memorial to the Holocaust, a searing reminder of the need for a Jewish homeland. Also nearby are the Mount Herzl national civil and military cemeteries, the final resting place of many of Israel&apos;s political leaders and soldiers. The area is rich in symbols of Israeli nationalism. The train heads north and east, passing through Kiryat Moshe, a Jewish area with a significant religious-nationalist community, over the stunning \u201cbridge of strings\u201d, designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and resembling a giant harp soaring towards the sky. Soon it travels through the traditional commercial heart of Jerusalem, Jaffa Road, lined with historic stone buildings strung with electric cables and plastered with political and religious posters. British soldiers once frequented shady bars and hotels along the road during the three decades of the British mandate era, following the first world war. Later the area fell into decay. Now closed to vehicles to accommodate the rail tracks, Jaffa Road has seen a revival, with cafe tables spilling over the pedestrianised thoroughfare and global brand outlets opening next to tiny older shops selling yarmulkes, cheap suitcases and falafel.     Jerusalem's light rail connects many neighbourhoods whose residents would not normally mix. Image: the Guardian    Past Jerusalem&apos;s vibrant shuk (food market) and city hall, the train rounds a corner, where it meets the walls of the Old City, scraping by buildings still bearing battle scars from 1948 and 1967. The next stop is Damascus Gate, the 16th-century entrance to the Old City and the grandest of the seven open gates to the narrow winding alleyways and religious sites of one of the most extraordinary square miles in the world. For a long stretch, the train now follows the green line, drawn at the end of the 1948 war over Israel&apos;s declaration of a state, dividing what had been Palestine into two: the modern state of Israel, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which was governed by Jordan until 1967 (Gaza was governed by Egypt). For almost 20 years, Jerusalem was bisected into the Jewish west and Arab east, with a border marked by barbed wire, patrolled by soldiers and punctuated by watchtowers. The green line, now invisible on the ground, remains a key factor for hapless peace negotiators, whose latest efforts have just reached yet another impasse. This section of the light rail&apos;s route sits on what may in the future be a border between two states. The train skirts the main Jewish ultra-orthodox enclaves of the city, where stones are thrown at cars breaking the sabbath prohibition and women are instructed to wear modest dress (\u201cclosed blouse, with long sleeves, long skirt \u2013 no trousers, no tight-fitting clothes,\u201d according to the text of wall posters), and up to French Hill, the site of the first post-1967 Jewish settlement across the green line and later, of numerous bus bombings carried out by Palestinian militants. From there, it passes through two big Palestinian neighbourhoods, Shuafat and Beit Hanina \u2013 poorer, bleaker and vastly underserviced compared to most of West Jerusalem - before ending at Pisgat Ze&apos;ev, a modern toy-town settlement on the north-eastern edge of the city, home to around 50,000 Jews. According to Danny Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer who focuses on political issues concerning Jerusalem, the impact of the railway has been huge for Palestinians in the city. The planners were disinclined to route the railway through Shuafat and Beit Hanina, he says, for fear of deterring Israeli passengers and fuelling fears of terror attacks. \u201cBut were it only to go through &apos;Israeli&apos; areas, they would be open to the charge that it was a racist railway. So it was routed this way with great reluctance.\u201d The unintended consequence has been to make it much easier for Palestinians to get to the Old City. \u201cIt&apos;s brought Haram al-Sharif [the site of the Dome of the Rock] closer to Beit Hanina and Shuafat,\u201d says Seidemann. And not just the Muslim holy sites, he adds; Palestinians are more visible in the west of the city than previously. \u201cHas that united the city? No, but it&apos;s an interesting change in the patterns of movement.\u201d The reverse is not the case. \u201cThe light rail has not brought Israelis into Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem. On the Israeli side, the patterns of movement have not changed at all.\u201d Jerusalem&apos;s rightwing mayor, Nir Barkat, says the light rail is part of his vision to bring 10 million tourists to the city each year as well as improving transport for residents. \u201cIf you look at all the modern cities of the world, they all have effective public transportation systems. Everyone gains. This is for the benefit of all residents.\u201d     A Jewish ultra-orthodox man stands by a light rail train sign in Jerusalem. Photograph: Sebastian Scheiner/AP    That statement sits uncomfortably with the fact that Palestinians, who make up 37% of the city&apos;s population, are deprived of this effective transport system on Saturdays, a normal working day for most of them, because the light rail does not operate on the Jewish sabbath. And it&apos;s unlikely their numbers are adequately reflected in the railway&apos;s workforce; the operator CityPass keeps no data on how many Palestinians are employed, although it says Arab train drivers and maintenance workers are among its workforce. Barkat plans to add new routes to the light railway in the coming years: one from Gilo, a settlement in the south of the city, to Hebrew University in the north; and the second also from Gilo to Ramot, another settlement across the green line to the north. He says the aim is to connect \u201cmajor neighbourhoods\u201d, and estimates the two lines will between seven and 10 years to become operable. But what happens if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that includes Jerusalem being divided into two capitals for each state? According to Seidemann, \u201ca permanent agreement on Israel-Palestine in general, and Jerusalem in particular, will be a divorce, not a marriage. That means there&apos;s going to be a binary border, and it&apos;s likely to be a physical border because one of the main motivations is separation and delineation.\u201d The border will follow the green line, and the railway, he says, will simply have to be rerouted. For Barkat, this is unthinkable. \u201cThere&apos;s not one example in the world of a split city that ever functioned, in the same way that you don&apos;t see people with two heads wandering around. It doesn&apos;t work, it will never work. Jerusalem is not negotiable. Simple.\u201d It&apos;s not an immediate prospect, however. Some say that, given the breakdown of peace negotiations, a return to violence in Jerusalem \u2013 and elsewhere \u2013 is a more likely scenario. If so, fears that the jewel in the city&apos;s transport crown could be a target for terrorism will resurface, and the limited signs of co-existence within the railway&apos;s carriages will vanish.  And encounters such as the one between the four provocative Palestinian lads and the gun-cradling Israeli could have an uglier outcome. Further reading: Jerusalem&apos;s buses explained Despite the opening of the light rail in August 2011, buses still dominate Jerusalem&apos;s public transport system. But unlike most cities, there are separate bus companies and routes servicing different sections of the population. \u201cIsraeli\u201d buses, run by the public transport company Egged, dominate the city centre and stretch out to Jerusalem suburbs, and beyond to other towns and cities in Israel. Their green-liveried vehicles also connect Jewish settlements across the green line to each other and to the centre. A number of lines run across the concrete separation barrier and deep inside the West Bank to settlements that are far outside Jerusalem. White \u201cPalestinian\u201d buses connect Palestinian neighbourhoods with the Arab commercial centre in East Jerusalem and access points to Muslim holy sites in the Old City, and to the main West Bank cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem, Hebron, Nablus, Jericho and Jenin.     Greater Israel bus map (detail). Photograph: Visualizing Palestine (full map here)    Indeed, there are two &quot;central bus stations&quot; in the city, one in west Jerusalem for Israeli buses, and one in east Jerusalem for Palestinian buses. There is no formal segregation: Israeli and Palestinian residents of the city can use the \u201cother side&apos;s\u201d bus system, although Jewish passengers are rare on Palestinian buses. But Palestinian drivers on Israeli buses are not uncommon. Israeli buses were often targeted by Palestinian suicide bombers in the uprising that began in 2000. The last bus bombing in Jerusalem was in March 2011, in which a British woman died.

This week&apos;s Social Innovation Summit taking place at the United Nations brings together an unusually large representation of public and private actors to debate and challenge urgent questions facing the public and private sectors. Participants include hundreds of top Fortune 500 corporate executives, venture capitalists, government leaders, foundation heads and social entrepreneurs eager to discuss global challenges, analyse innovative approaches for problem-solving, and build lasting partnerships that will enable them and their organisations to maximise social impact. How can an NGO and a corporation create an effective partnership? In our varied experiences, when a non-profit is seeking to partner with a corporation, all too often the first priority is funding. It&apos;s a natural starting point for a conversation, but an undifferentiated one that puts corporate representatives immediately on the defensive. Many non-profits\u2014well-intentioned and well-meaning\u2014walk into a large corporation without having explored what a truly effective corporate partnership could look like. As a result, too often these non-profits miss the larger opportunity for developing a meaningful partnership and creating real shared value. Certain non-profits may need in-kind skills, talents or goods and services. And then there&apos;s something that Zeev has termed &quot;karmic&quot;\u2014where networking with social entrepreneurs allows for a greater understanding of what the ecosystem looks like and eventually, through relationship building and ongoing dialogue, the non-profit leader is able to build and strengthen its position and identify the right person for his or her company&apos;s needs. Four important considerations for successful relationships between NGO&apos;s and non-profits and their corporate partners  Employee engagement Most private sector firms are looking for ways to engage their employees. This includes board participation, and/or strategic counsel for non-profits, and of course, skills-based volunteerism. One of the best suggestions for any non-profit is to recognise the huge talent base often available inside corporations and explore ways in which corporations can engage their employees for pro bono service. In addition, corporations are also often eager to support employee participation in worthwhile causes and programs that have fundraising potential where their employees can participate and serve (ie. in soup kitchens, painting schools, walkathon participation, etc.). Brand value  Non-profits often underestimate the potential brand and visibility lift that comes from a corporate partnership. This refers to the priceless PR value of being able to say that you are partnered with &quot;Big Brand X.&quot; Consider how many millions of dollars are poured into developing a strong corporate brand, and by association, the non-profit benefits from the affiliation including key recognition in joint press releases, marketing and media. The increased visibility and validation in the eyes of external stakeholders may translate to not just an increase in fundraising opportunities but potentially to other collaborations as well. Expanding opportunities The good news is, directly or indirectly, corporate partners are likely to bring other players and corporate partners to the table. Once a non-profit has been able to make a statement to the industry or sector that you&apos;ve partnered with one of their peers, it opens up a floodgate of opportunities. Organisations must be considerate of their private sector partner. For example, it&apos;s rare that two direct business competitors will work with the same non-profit, and much more common that adjacent entities will enjoy the partnership. However, often if corporations work together or partner in business or the for-profit space, it&apos;s likely that they can also partner in the non-profit world. Funding and capital While money is the most common reason for non-profits and NGO&apos;s to look for a corporate partner, it cannot be the sole driving factor. Partnerships are about relationships. This takes time to develop. While funding is often critical to success, receiving support should hopefully be just the beginning of a deeper and potentially even more rewarding, true and sustainable partnership. There is a growing acceptance that new ideas and creative concepts can be delivered by strong collaboration. It would be exciting if we could measure and monitor what linkages and programs are stimulated vis-a-vis events like the Social Innovation Summit - but for now, let us continue to encourage and foster the growth of such innovative partnerships.

Cyprus has become the civil wedding destination for Middle Eastern couples. In 1980, 61 Lebanese brides and 78 Lebanese grooms were married there, as well as 98 Israeli grooms and 99 Israeli brides. In 2013, there were 2,131 Israeli weddings, 581 Lebanese ones, and 35 Syrian unions. Some municipalities, such as tourist-friendly Livadia, report even more startling figures; last year, of the 1,000 or so weddings it recorded, 350 were Lebanese, 425 were Israeli, and 20 were Syrian. Cyprus&apos;s appeal for unconventional Middle Eastern lovers is simple: in Israel and Lebanon, non-religious weddings are a practical impossibility, but both countries recognise civil marriages conducted abroad. &quot;Once the war in Lebanon ended in the early 90s, mixed marriages between the various communities and religions started increasing gradually in Cyprus,&quot; says Maisy Khoury, a Cypriot wedding planner with Lebanese heritage. &quot;For the past 10 years it&apos;s been a rising\u00a0trend.&quot; Dan Cristal, a wedding celebrant from Tel Aviv describes a similar tendency, albeit with different causes.

Asmir Begovic  Now considered to be one of the top goalkeepers in the Premier League, Asmir Begovic made the first steps in his career under the guidance of his father Amir. As a third of the population did, Begovic&apos;s family fled the country in 1992 to escape the war, and spent years in exile in Germany and Canada. His father, being a former goalkeeper of local side Leotar Trebinje in the Yugoslav second division, kept working with his son the whole time, being his personal coach until Asmir moved to England. Begovic often points out how his old man was a great teacher and how he learned the goalkeeping basics from him. Asmir is a big fan of all sports, including ice hockey, basketball and baseball. His wife Nicole, who is a dressage rider, recently received Bosnian citizenship and hopes she can represent Bosnia in the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Sejad Salihovic After not getting enough playing time at Hertha Berlin, Salihovic decided in 2006 to go down the ranks and join Hoffenheim, the team that was at the time in the third tier of the German league system. Since then he has become their loyal lieutenant, playing 230 matches and helping establish them as Bundesliga regulars. The 29-year-old midfielder, who is considered to be one of the best takers of a free-kick in Germany, claims that he rejected an offer from Bayern Munich to stay in the small village of Sinsheim. He still lives there, refusing to join the rest of the team in Heidelberg, Izet Hajrovic In November 2012, when Bosnia-Herzegovina had already started their march towards Brazil, the then 20-year-old Galatasaray midfielder was in Tunisia, having made his debut for Switzerland. He replaced Tranquillo Barnetta and while Ottmar Hitzfeld praised him, he became unpopular in the homeland of his parents. But after Hitzfeld left him out of the Switzerland squad for the qualifiers, Hajrovic suddenly changed his mind and less than a year later he was wearing the Bosnia shirt. However, his call-up has caused controversy. Edin Dzeko, who publicly criticised him when he opted for Switzerland, as did a couple of other experienced players, did not hide his anger. But when Hajrovic struck a superb goal in Slovakia to earn a 2-1 win in the most important match of the qualifiers, all the disputes were forgotten. Haris Medunjanin The midfielder, who has played for AZ Alkmaar, Real Valladolid and Maccabi Tel Aviv before moving to his present club, Gaziantepspor, in Turkey, is the only Bosnian international who has actually won a trophy at international level. Medunjanin was a member of the Dutch under-21 side who won the European Championship played in Portugal in 2006. Raised in Holland, he celebrated the title with his then team-mates Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ron Vlaar, and Milan&apos;s Urby Emanuelson. Edin Dzeko The Manchester City striker is the top scorer in the country&apos;s history and its biggest star. The start of his career was completely different - even though he was given a professional contract by his parent club, Zeljeznicar Sarajevo, and a first-team debut as a 17-year-old prospect, he was mocked by his own fans who nicknamed him &quot;Kloc&quot; \u2013 the local slang term for a lamp-post. He was forced to move first to the Czech league and then to Germany, where he flourished under the guidance of Felix Magath at Wolfsburg. He had a reputation for being a ladies man, but is now in a relationship with the Bosnian-American model Amra Silajdzic \u2013 the Bosnian tabloids&apos; favourite topic. Tino-Sven Susi\u0107 The midfielder, who now plays for Hajduk Split, was given his international debut in March and by putting the 22-year-old in his provisional squad for the World Cup, Safet Susic opened a can of worms. Tino-Sven is Safet&apos;s nephew, and his call-up automatically raised the question of nepotism. The manager did not help himself by refusing to explain the reasons for selecting the player, who does not feature regularly in the team in the mediocre Croatian league and whose position is already covered by such as Miralem Pjanic and Zvjezdan Misimovic. Elvir Baljic (assistant coach, former international) In 1999, Safet Susic&apos;s right-hand man hit the headlines after John Toshack decided to pay Fenerbahce \u00a320m for his transfer to Real Madrid. A series of injuries prevented him from establishing himself as a first-team regular at the Bernab\u00e9u. Five years later, while he was still an active player in Turkey, he recorded his first folk music album. He always claimed he did it for the love for music, refusing to record videos and promote the album. However, just a couple of weeks ago he released a new single \u2026 Miralem Pjanic The Little Prince, as he has been nicknamed by fans, is a man who can keep a secret. Even though he is always the centre of attention for Bosnian and Italian tabloids, the Roma midfielder has managed to keep his private life hidden. In February 2013 he surprised the public by announcing that he and his French girlfriend Josefa had become parents to a son who was born five months previously. The proud father named his son - Edin.

The reader was Yossi Sarid, a former education and environment minister. His text is the testimony of a soldier in the Israel Defence Forces, one of 350 soldiers, politicians, journalists and activists who on Friday \u2013 the anniversary of Israel&apos;s occupation of Palestinian land in 1967 \u2013 recited first-hand soldiers&apos; accounts for 10 hours straight in Habima Square, all of them collected by the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence. When one of the group&apos;s researchers approached the soldier, they chatted politely out of earshot and then phone numbers were exchanged. Perhaps in the future this young man will give his own account to join the 950 testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence since it was founded 10 years ago. In that decade, Breaking the Silence has collected a formidable oral history of Israeli soldiers&apos; highly critical assessments of the world of conflict and occupation. The stories may be specific to Israel and its occupation of the Palestinian territories but they have a wider meaning, providing an invaluable resource that describes not just the nature of Israel&apos;s occupation but of how occupying soldiers behave more generally. They describe how abuses come from boredom; from the orders of ambitious officers keen to advance in their careers; or from the institutional demands of occupation itself, which desensitises and dehumanises as it creates a distance from the &quot;other&quot;. In granular detail, the tens of thousands of words narrated on Friday told of the humdrum and the terrible: the humiliating treatment of Palestinians at checkpoints, shootings and random assaults. Over the years the Israeli military&apos;s response has been that these stories are the exceptions, not the rule, accounts of a few bad apples&apos; actions. &quot;What we wanted to show by reading for 10 hours is that the things described in the testimonies we have collected are not exceptional, rather they are unexceptional,&quot; says Yehuda Shaul, one of the founders of the group and a former soldier himself. Shaul breaks off to greet the European Union ambassador and a woman soldier who served in his own unit whom he has not seen for years. We talk about the solitary soldier in the square, now talking to the researcher. &quot;We&apos;ll get in contact. See if he wants to talk. Perhaps meet for coffee. Then, when we interview people, we ask them to recommend us to their friends. We might get 10 phone numbers, of whom three will talk to us.&quot; It is not only word of mouth that produces Breaking the Silence&apos;s interviews. At the annual conferences that soldiers leaving the army attend to prepare them for the return to civilian life, researchers will try to talk to soldiers outside. Shaul explains why he and his colleagues have dedicated themselves to this project, why he believes it is as necessary today as when he first spoke out a decade ago about his own experience as a soldier in Hebron. &quot;In Israeli politics today the occupation is absent. It&apos;s not an issue for the public. It has become normal \u2013 not second nature; the occupation has become part of our nature. The object of events like today is for us to occupy the public space with the occupation.&quot; His sentiments are reflected by the Israeli novelist and playwright AB Yehoshua, who gets on the stage to read a comment piece he had written the day before to mark the event. &quot;The great danger to Israeli society,&quot; Yehoshua explains, &quot;is the danger of weariness and repression. We no longer have the energy and patience to hear about another act of injustice.&quot; A man appears holding a handwritten sign that condemns Breaking the Silence as &quot;traitors&quot;. Some of those attending try to usher him away while others try to engage him in conversation. A journalist asks Shaul if the man is &quot;pro-army&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m pro-army,&quot; Shaul answers immediately. &quot;I&apos;m not a pacifist, although some of our members have become pacifists. I&apos;m not anti-army, I am anti-occupation.&quot; ISRAELI SOLDIERS&apos; OWN WORDS     Nadav Weiman. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    SERGEANT NADAV WEIMAN2005-08, Nachal Reconnaissance Unit, JeninWe&apos;d spread out above Jenin on &quot;the stage&quot;, which is a tiny mountain top. That evening an arrest mission was in progress, there were riots inside the refugee camp, and we sat above and provided sniper cover for the operation. Things got rolling and there were arrests, some rioting began in the city. There was random peripheral fire so there were generally no people on rooftops. Some time in the middle of the night, we detected someone on a roof. We focused our sights on him, not knowing for sure whether or not he was a scout. But we targeted him and got an OK to fire because he was on a rooftop very close to one of our forces. We were several snipers, and we took him down ... Later when we got back to Jalame, it started: &quot;Was he armed or not?&quot; But we&apos;d got our OK from the battalion commander. He was also the one to come and speak with us when we got back to the base in Jalame. We were with the guys with whom we sat to debrief after the action, and it was wall-to-wall, &quot;You don&apos;t realise how lucky you are to have actually fired in an operation. That hardly ever happens, you are so lucky.&quot; And according to the way we implemented the rules of engagement, we declared him a target by documenting him. We thought the Palestinian had been speaking on the phone, he seemed to be raising his hand to his head, looking sideways, going back and forth, just like a person scouting and sending information back. You could see the angles of his body, his whole conduct facing the soldiers who were north of him, in the alley below, a few metres away. SERGEANT, ANONYMOUSUndisclosed Reservist unit, Gaza Strip 2009, Operation Cast Lead The actual objective remained rather vague. We were told our objective was to fragment the Strip, in fact we were told that while we were there, not knowing how long, we would have to raze the area as much as possible. Razing is a euphemism for systematic destruction. Two reasons were given for house demolitions. One reason was operational. That&apos;s when a house is suspected to contain explosive, tunnels, when all kinds of wires are seen, or digging. Or we have intelligence information making it suspect. Or it&apos;s a source of fire, whether light arms or mortars, missiles, Grads [rockets], all that stuff. Those are houses we demolish. Then we&apos;re told some will be destroyed for &quot;the day after&quot;. The rationale is to leave a sterile area behind us and the best way to do that is by razing it. In practical terms, it means you take a house that&apos;s not suspect, its only transgression is that it stands on a hill in Gaza. I can even say that in a talk with my battalion commander, he mentioned this and said half smiling, half sad, that this is something to add to his list of war crimes. So he himself understood there was a problem.     Tal Wasser. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    SERGEANT TAL WASSER 2006-09, Oketz (canine special forces), Nablus Standing at the roadblock for eight hours a day puts everyone under this endless pressure. Everyone&apos;s constantly yelling, constantly nervous, impatient \u2026 venting on the first Palestinian to cross your path. If a Palestinian annoys one of the soldiers, one of the things they&apos;d do is throw him in the Jora, which is a small cell, like a clothing store dressing room. They close the metal door on him and that would be his punishment for annoying, for being bad. Within all the pressure and the stress of the roadblock, the Palestinian would often be forgotten there. No one would remember that he put a Palestinian there, further emphasising the irrelevance and insignificance of the reason he was put there in the first place. Sometimes it was only after hours that they&apos;d suddenly remember to let him out and continue the inspection at the roadblock. SERGEANT, ANONYMOUSNablus Regional Brigade, Nablus, 2014 &quot;Provocation and reaction&quot; is the act of entering a village, making a lot of noise, waiting for the stones to be thrown at you and then you arrest them, saying: &quot;There, they&apos;re throwing stones.&quot; Lots of vehicles move inside the whole village, barriers. A barrier seems to be the army&apos;s legitimate means to stop terrorists. We&apos;re talking about Area B [under civilian Palestinian control and Israeli security control], but the army goes in there every day, practically, provoking stone throwings. Just as any Palestinian is suspect, this is the same idea. It could be a kid&apos;s first time ever throwing a stone, but as far as the army is concerned, we&apos;ve caught the stone thrower.     Avner Gvaryahu. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    SERGEANT AVNER GVARYAHU2004-07 Orev (special anti-tank unit), Nablus It was when I was a sergeant, after we had finished training. 200 [the number of the commander] said to us unequivocally: &quot;That&apos;s how you&apos;re ranked. With Xs. Every night I want you to be looking for &apos;contact&apos; [an exchange of fire] and that&apos;s how you&apos;ll be ranked.&quot; At some point I realised that someone who wants to succeed has to bring him dead people. There&apos;s no point in bringing him arrests. [The message was:] &quot;Arrests are routine, the battalions are making arrests. You&apos;re the spearhead, the army has invested years in you, now I want you to bring me dead terrorists.&quot; And that&apos;s what pushed us, I believe. What we&apos;d do was go out night after night, drawing fire, go into alleys that we knew were dangerous. There were arrests, there were all kinds of arrests. But the high point of the night was drawing fire, creating a situation where they fired at us. It&apos;s a situation, totally insane, you&apos;re in it, it&apos;s hard to explain. You&apos;re looking through the binoculars and searching for someone to kill. That&apos;s what you want to do. And you want to kill him. But do you want to kill him? But that&apos;s your job. And you&apos;re still looking through the binoculars and you&apos;re starting to get confused. Do I want to? Don&apos;t I want to? Maybe I actually want them to miss. SERGEANT, ANONYMOUSKfir Brigade, Tul Karem, 2008 There was one checkpoint that was divided into three lanes: there&apos;s a settlement, a checkpoint, and then Israeli territory. In the middle, there&apos;s a Palestinian village, so they just split the checkpoint into three lanes. Three lanes, and the brigade commander ordered that Jews should only wait at the checkpoint for 10 minutes. Because of that we had to have a special lane for them, and everyone else, the Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, had to wait in the other two lanes. I remember that settlers would come, go around the Arabs, and just did it naturally. I went over to a settler and said: &quot;Why are you going around? There&apos;s a line here, sir.&quot; He said: &quot;You really think I&apos;m going to wait behind an Arab?&quot; He began to raise his voice at me. &quot;You&apos;re going to hear from your brigade commander.&quot;     Gil Hillel. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    GIL HILLEL2001-03, Sachlav (military police), Hebron On my first or second day in Hebron, my commanders asked me to go on a &quot;doll&quot;, a foot patrol that we conduct in the casbah and Jewish settlement. I agreed, it seemed cool. It was my first time in the field, come on, let&apos;s do it. We went on patrol, into the casbah, and I think that was the first time I sensed the existential fear of living under constant threat. We started the doll and I started feeling bad. The first time in the field is not simple. One of my commanders, the veteran among them, took an old Palestinian man, just took him aside to some alley and started beating him up. And I \u2026 it wasfine by all the others \u2026 I sort of looked at them and said: &quot;What is he doing? Why is he doing that? What happened? Did he do anything? Is he a threat? A terrorist? Did we find something?&quot; So they said: &quot;No, it&apos;s OK.&quot; I then approached my commander, the [one] who trained me, and asked: &quot;What are you doing?&quot; He said: &quot;Gil, stop it.&quot; And that really scared me. I was scared of their reactions, of the situation we were in. I felt bad with what went on there, but I kept quiet. I mean, what can I do? My commander told me to shut up. We left there and went back to the company and I went to my commander and said: &quot;What are you doing? Why did you do that?&quot; So he said: &quot;That&apos;s the way it is. It&apos;s either him or me and it&apos;s me and \u2026&quot; They took him aside and just beat him up. They beat him up, they punched him. And slapped him, all for no reason. I mean, he just happened to walk by there, by mistake. SERGEANT, ANONYMOUSNachal Brigade, 50th Battalion, Hebron, 2010 The Jewish settlers of Hebron constantly curse the Arabs. An Arab who passes by too closely gets cursed: &quot;May you burn, die.&quot; On Shuhada Street there&apos;s a very short section where Arabs may walk as well, which leads to Tel Rumeida neighbourhood. Once I was sent there and we found three Jewish kids hitting an old Arab woman. Another man from the Jewish settlement happened along and also joined them in yelling at the woman: &quot;May you die!&quot; When we got there they were mainly yelling, but there had clearly been blows dealt as well. I think they even threw stones at her. I believe the [policeman] was called but ended up not doing anything. The general atmosphere was that there was no point in summoning the police \u2013 the policeman is a local settler from Kiryat Arba who comes to pray with the Hebron settlers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs on Fridays.     Nadav Bigelman. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum    SERGEANT NADAV BIGELMAN2007-10, Nachal Brigade, 50th Battalion, Hebron During patrols inside the casbah we&apos;d do many &quot;mappings&quot;. Mappings mean going into a house we have no intelligence on. We go in to see what&apos;s inside, who lives there. We didn&apos;t search for weapons or things like that. The mappings were designed to make the Palestinians feel that we are there all the time. We go in, walk around, look around. The commander takes a piece of paper and \u2026 makes a drawing of the house, what it looks like inside, and I had a camera. I was told to bring it. They said: &quot;You take all the people, stand them against the wall and take their picture.&quot; Then [the pictures are] transferred to, I don&apos;t know, the General Security Service, the battalion or brigade intelligence unit, so they have information on what the people look like. What the residents look like. I&apos;m a young soldier, I do as they say. I take their pictures, a horrible experience in itself, because taking people&apos;s pictures at 3am, I \u2026 it humiliated them, I just can&apos;t describe it. And the interesting thing? I had the pictures for around a month. No one came to get them. No commander asked about them, no intelligence officer took them. I realised it was all for nothing. It was just to be there. It was like a game. SERGEANT, ANONYMOUSParatrooper, 2002, Nablus We took over a central house, set up positions, and one of the sharpshooters identified a man on a roof, two roofs away, I think he was between 50 and 70 metres away, not armed. I looked at the man through the night vision \u2013 he wasn&apos;t armed. It was two in the morning. A man without arms, walking on the roof, just walking around. We reported it to the company commander. The company commander said: &quot;Take him down.&quot; [The sharpshooter] fired, took him down. The company commander basically ordered, decided via radio, the death sentence for that man. A man who wasn&apos;t armed. I saw with my own eyes that the guy wasn&apos;t armed. The report also said: &quot;A man without arms on the roof.&quot; The company commander declared him a lookout, meaning he understood that the guy was no threat to us, and he gave the order to kill him and we shot him. I myself didn&apos;t shoot, my friend shot and killed him. And basically you think, you see in the United States there&apos;s the death penalty, for every death sentence there are like a thousand appeals and convictions, and they take it very seriously, and there are judges and learned people, and there are protests and whatever.

With this second volume of memoir she reveals the person who inspired both her love of literature and her powers of sympathy: her mother. It is not a simple story. Rhoda Press was a gifted woman, unfulfilled as a Cape Town housewife in\u00a0the 1930s and 40s, but sustained by poetic dreams and a love of reading. Her\u00a0first child&apos;s name was a tribute to the heroine of Olive Schreiner&apos;s veld classic The Story of an African Farm and marked Lyndall as &quot;my mother&apos;s creature&quot;. Rhoda longed for a soulmate, a\u00a0sister, someone with whom to share her favourite authors: Emily Dickinson, Emily Bront\u00eb, William Wordsworth. She read Thomas Mann aloud to her child. Her own poems, too. But life was made more difficult by an illness that remained mysterious for\u00a0years \u2013 to her daughter at any rate. Gordon opens her book with a dramatic reconstruction of what she had to do, as a four-year-old, when her mother called for help \u2013 throw water in her face and press a hairbrush into her wrists as hard as possible. Unsurprisingly, the tiny carer never managed to do this hard enough; Rhoda &quot;wrenches the brush from my hand and drives the bristles back and forth \u2013 until she comes round&quot;. From the notebooks, letters and diaries that Gordon inherited when her\u00a0mother died 15 years ago, it is clear that\u00a0Rhoda saw her condition (epilepsy, not\u00a0madness as the child feared) as a\u00a0creative portal: &quot;Through epilepsy I\u00a0was stripped down to the foundation rock from which I was able to strike new sparks. For on the edge of that precipice, any weakness in thought, word or deed could plunge one into the bottomless pit, there where all vanities and falsities are expunged.&quot; Gordon connects this with the visionary leaps of Dostoevsky&apos;s epileptic Myshkin, Wordsworth&apos;s &quot;sense sublime&quot; and Emily Bront\u00eb&apos;s otherworldliness. The biographical bombshell when Gordon wrote about Emily Dickinson in 2012 was to suggest that the poet had been epileptic: now we see where this &quot;flash&quot; of her own came from. For all its difficulties, Rhoda&apos;s was a\u00a0strange and exciting presence \u2013 like a\u00a0character in a novel. The state of expectancy she lived in made her always on the brink of falling in love, whether it was with a book, a picture, place or person. One of these coups de foudre happened in 1952, four years after her diagnosis, when Rhoda, travelling in Finland with her husband, made an instant connection with a woman at a\u00a0museum that led to a soul-baring friendship. Their letters are immediately lover-like\u2026 &quot;My dear, dear Near-One \u2026 it is after all a surprising present to get you thus, although from the first flash of\u00a0the intuitive contact with you I\u00a0know what you are.&quot; Poems were written, books shared, and, under the influence of this ardent friend, Rhoda decided it was time to give her muse a\u00a0chance and\u00a0moved to London, alone, for several years. Another swerve happened in the mid-1950s, when the Israeli politician Nahum Levin arrived in Cape Town on\u00a0a Hebrew language promotional mission and, despite needing an interpreter, formed a close liaison with Rhoda. Lyndall, who had got swept up\u00a0in the general enthusiasm for the fledging state of Israel and embraced &quot;folk-dancing and socialism&quot; in the local Jewish youth movement, accompanied her mother willingly on a\u00a0trip to Tel Aviv, not realising that Rhoda had her own motives. Lyndall believed that the date she found on her first night was all part of the miraculousness of the promised land, but later discovered that her mother had arranged it in order to have free time with her lover. Lyndall had seen Levin &quot;coming like a\u00a0comet through the crowd&quot; in the hotel lobby and not understood he was on the way to an assignation. At moments like these, the\u00a0memoir seems as racy as a\u00a0novel. Gordon stayed in Israel with a view to studying and perhaps emigrating there, but disappointed her mother enormously by coming home after a year, inadequately rapturous. Rhoda was glad to have her &quot;sister&quot; back though, and signed up as a student of English literature with her at Cape Town University, telling her Finnish confidante: &quot;I no longer walk by myself and wave my wild tail but live pleasantly in the warm company of L &amp; her friends.&quot; It was far from relaxing for Lyndall, though, to be thrust back into the caring role, driving mother to and from classes and helping her find books, &quot;never unaware how a\u00a0dispirited mood can jump the barriers to an attack. If she&apos;s precarious in the morning before we leave or jittery over an essay, I worry.&quot; The unspoken tensions mount as Gordon&apos;s narrative moves rapidly from college to marriage to emigration (connected with her husband&apos;s career in\u00a0medicine in New York) to pregnancy, motherhood and breakdown. Suddenly, the promising young postgrad is facing the prospect of being institutionalised forever. This shocking episode \u2013 far worse than anything her mother had to\u00a0endure \u2013 draws out a harsher, terser voice and acute analysis (of the treatment she received, in particular) that is\u00a0rarely unleashed elsewhere. Towards her mother, though, Gordon seems endlessly generous and grateful, crediting her, for instance, with a way of reading TS Eliot against the critical consensus and vehemently defending her right to fight off &quot;the dark night of depletion&quot; that she thinks motherhood and home life can mean to sensitive women. Gordon insists that she and her brother understood their mother&apos;s longings and did not feel deprived when they were left for years in Cape Town with their father (a charming-sounding lawyer and competitive swimmer, whose personality is almost entirely blotted out by his wife&apos;s). The reader will almost certainly form a different view. One feels that as a\u00a0scrupulous biographer, Gordon has laid out all the evidence, but as a memoirist draws back from the conclusions it would be too undaughterly to articulate. She remains free to celebrate the non-mother, the dreamer, whose letters and notebooks are powerfully eloquent. &quot;Things, meanings, take time to sink into me \u2013 only long afterwards when I\u00a0uncover the reality I am sad to find that my response missed the need,&quot; Rhoda told her daughter in 1968. This book realigns those meanings. Literature is where their relationship blossomed and where it is now preserved. One of Rhoda&apos;s notebooks tells how she left her luggage on a bus in Finland and tried to catch up with it courtesy of\u00a0a passing motorcyclist: &quot;Away I fly. Hair streaming, clutching the shoulders of an unknown man. I have never even seen his face. I don&apos;t know where my legs are, and I don&apos;t seem to care about them. I am fine, loving it \u2013 and laughing, but laughing!&quot; \u2022 To order Divided Lives for \u00a316 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.", "publicationDate": "2014-06-12T09:00:00Z", "title": "Divided Lives: Dreams of a Mother and Daughter by Lyndall Gordon \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Lyndall, who had got swept up\u00a0in the general enthusiasm for the fledging state of Israel and embraced &quot;folk-dancing and socialism&quot; in the local Jewish youth movement, accompanied her mother willingly on a\u00a0trip to Tel Aviv, not realising that Rhoda had her own motives."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/12/divided-lives-dreams-mother-daughter-review-memoir-lyndall-gordon"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israeli security forces have launched a mass search of the Hebron hills after three teenagers, one believed to be a US citizen, were reported missing amid fears they may gave been kidnapped by a Palestinian group.

The three \u2013 two are reported to be 16 and the third 19 \u2013 went missing near the Gush Etzion block of settlements late on Thursday night, near Hebron on the West Bank. According to an Israeli army spokesman, the three teenagers were hitchhiking at around 10.30pm on Thursday. According to one report, Israel&apos;s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet and the Israeli army treated the incident as a kidnapping after it was discovered that the teenagers&apos; mobile phones stopped broadcasting location signals on a road between the settlements of Kfar Etzion and Alon Shvut. &quot;He just disappeared, never made it home,&quot; a relative of one of the teenagers told the Ynet website. &quot;His parents are worried, praying, hoping for the best.&quot; The three, all religious students at the Makor Chaim yeshiva, were believed to have been hitchhiking to Modi&apos;in, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

The State Department in Washington would not confirm that one of the three was an American citizen, citing privacy concerns, but said that secretary of state John Kerry had spoken to the Israeli justice minister, Tzipi Livni, and by telephone to the Palestinian president Mahmouod Abbas. &quot;We are working with the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to try to ensure that the situation is resolved quickly and that the three teenagers are safely reunited with their families,&quot; the spokesman said. On whether one of the teenagers held American citizneship, he would only say: &quot;We have seen those reports, but cannot confirm them due to privacy considerations.

Then I spot a strange scene that assures me I haven&apos;t taken a wrong turn. Through a townhouse&apos;s wide glass doors, I spy six expectant-looking people sitting around a long table, while a man at the back is carefully arranging a row of plates on a\u00a0makeshift bar. &quot;Is\u00a0this EatWith?&quot; I ask tentatively, but I already know the answer. Dining in unusual places with people that you&apos;ve never met is what Eatwith.com was invented for. The website is an online directory of supper\u00a0clubs: anyone can apply to be a\u00a0host, in\u00a0their home or a venue of their \u00a0choice, and anyone who pays a small fee can attend. Founded in Tel Aviv, the site has had an incredible first year, expanding to feature 20 countries, including the US, Japan, Brazil and Italy. But it&apos;s in Barcelona, the official launch city, that it is the most active, with an astonishing 200\u00a0hosts. And so this is where I come to give it a\u00a0trial run. Earlier, after logging in and browsing the options on the website, I&apos;d found myself drawn to\u00a0the idea of a chocolate-themed night. Although most events take place in people&apos;s dining rooms, this one proves slightly different. The ground floor of the house has been transformed into an events space by Miquel, a\u00a0thirtysomething, self-taught artisan chocolatier. Whitewashed walls cocoon an interior that&apos;s almost empty, bar a few well-sourced pieces of vintage furniture \u2013 an old fridge here, a hefty chest of drawers there. The online description was a little vague (&quot;It&apos;s just creativity and madness!&quot;), so I&apos;m not sure what to expect. What I get is a remarkably imaginative, multi-course tasting menu. First: a smooth chocolate fondant, covered in a lightly whipped carrot mousse. Next: tender ravioli, filled with lentils and chocolate, in a miso broth. It&apos;s weird but it works. Both dishes are perfectly executed, attractively presented and surprisingly moreish. And the meal costs me just \u00a313 \u2013 about the same as a tour of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.     Miquel hosting an EatWith evening.     Miquel says EatWith \u2013 which takes 15% of what each guest pays \u2013 is serving him well as he tries to build up his business of making and, he hopes, exporting chocolates. &quot;People ask why I don&apos;t just get customers off the streets,&quot; he says, &quot;but I like the flexibility. I like the characteristics of the people it brings. This is not a shop. I am not looking to compete with normal chocolatiers.&quot; Although EatWith originally set out to target tourists, the biggest uptake in locations all over the world has come from locals. My fellow diners all live in Barcelona, despite originating from places as far-flung as Mexico, Sweden, Canada, France and Italy. Two of them are EatWith hosts themselves: outgoing Andrea, the Italian, hosts pizza parties in his back garden, and Monica, a firecracker from Mexico City, holds Mexican/Syrian food nights, to reflect her own mixed heritage. Underpinning the site is an idea that\u00a0everyone should have some sort of\u00a0USP \u2013 be that the cuisine, the theme\u00a0or the setting. To keep standards up, EatWith approves all its hosts, and those wanting to gain an additional &quot;verified&quot; badge can also be\u00a0visited by an inspector, who will check their menu, venue and interpersonal skills. Some would say supper clubs should be more of an underground network, operating without a middleman but at\u00a0least this site is taking responsibility, and offering its hosts support and, in some places, informal training.     Xabi preparing food for his dinner party    Over the course of my weekend, I\u00a0try two other EatWith dinners to get an idea of the variety on offer. One night I find myself in a fully open-plan apartment belonging to Xabi, a professional chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants. He was running supper clubs and cookery classes before EatWith but the site has given him a\u00a0wider reach. He serves a six-course menu (\u00a343pp including wine), ably assisted by a grandmotherly type called \u00c0ngels, who squeezes my arm as she sets down every dish: potato ravioli with truffle mayonnaise and rusi\u00f1ol (a local mushroom), and suquet (Catalan fish stew) with fennel confit. My final meal is with a young couple, Vanessa and Renato, who offer a night of traditional Catalan food in their one-bedroom apartment in the city centre. Here, we dig into delicious esqueixada de bacall\u00e0 (salt cod with tomatoes, onions, olives and vinegar) and fideu\u00e0, a Catalonian paella made with noodles. Before all this we try drinking wine out of a porr\u00f3 \u2013 those traditional glass carafes with a spout you hold above your mouth, moving your arm further and further away as your pour. It&apos;s an ice-breaker with a difference and I last about three seconds before dribbling down my front. Vanessa and Renato&apos;s dinner is also unlike the others because they join us to eat, rather than just serving the food. We sit surrounded by their books and travel photos and, as there are just two other guests (both Barcelona residents), it feels like I&apos;ve popped round to a friend&apos;s house for dinner. I&apos;m not sure how the evenings pan out in other countries but here the sobremesa (after-dinner conversation) at each event lasts for hours, and I\u00a0wonder if I have just lucked out with\u00a0particularly fine company. However, the early days of a peer-to-peer site are often the glory days, so if\u00a0you&apos;re considering it, now&apos;s the time to try EatWith. It&apos;s no more of a gamble than any restaurant \u2013 and could be far more entertaining.\u2022 More details from EatWith.com.

Pointing to the mayhem in Iraq, Netanyahu on Sunday called for the establishment of an independent Kurdistan as part of a broader alliance with moderate forces across the region, adding that Israel would have to maintain a long-term military presence in the West Bank even after any future peace agreement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu laid out his positions in a policy speech that marked his most detailed response to the gains made by Sunni extremists fighting in Iraq. His endorsement of Kurdish independence, as well as his tough position on the West Bank, put him at odds with prevailing international opinion. In a speech to a Tel Aviv thinktank, Netanyahu said that the rise of both al-Qaida-backed Sunni extremists, as well as Iranian-backed Shia forces, had created the opportunity for &quot;enhanced regional cooperation&quot;. He said Jordan, which is facing a growing threat of spillover from conflict in neighboring Iraq and Syria, and the Kurds, who control an oil-rich autonomous region of northern Iraq, should be bolstered. &quot;We should ... support the Kurdish aspiration for independence,&quot; Netanyahu told the thinktank, going on to call the Kurds &quot;a nation of fighters [who] have proved political commitment and are worthy of independence&quot;. Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. The Kurds have seized on recent sectarian chaos in Iraq to expand their autonomous northern territory to include Kirkuk, which sits on vast oil deposits that could make the independent state many dream of economically viable. The Kurds have long held aspirations for independence, but have said seeking nationhood is not realistic at the current time. The international community, including neighboring Turkey as well as the US and other western countries, are opposed to the breakup of Iraq. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, Washington has been insistent that it the crumbling unity in the country restored. Last Tuesday, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, visited Iraqi Kurdish leaders and urged them to seek political integration with Baghdad. Netanyahu&apos;s call for a long-term military presence in the West Bank also risked triggering international criticism. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day war, as the heartland of a future independent state, a position that is largely endorsed by the international community. The territory is flanked by Israel on the west and Jordan on the east. Netanyahu said that given the threats in the region, Israel would have to maintain a military presence throughout the West Bank for the foreseeable future. &quot;We must be able to stop the terrorism and fundamentalism that can reach us from the east at the Jordan line and not in the suburbs of Tel Aviv. He went on to say that whoever does not accept Israel&apos;s need for a security presence &quot;isn&apos;t facing reality&quot;. While conceding that there might someday be a peace agreement creating an independent Palestinian state, he argued that Israel could not turn over its security needs to either the Palestinians or international forces. He said Palestinian forces are &quot;not capable&quot; of ensuring security, and foreign forces would eventually withdraw. &quot;Therefore we must understand that in any future agreement with the Palestinians, Israel will have to continue controlling security in the territory up to Jordan for a very long time,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2014-06-29T18:32:00Z", "title": "Israel's prime minister backs Kurdish independence", "sentences": ["In a speech to a Tel Aviv thinktank, Netanyahu said that the rise of both al-Qaida-backed Sunni extremists, as well as Iranian-backed Shia forces, had created the opportunity for &quot;enhanced regional cooperation&quot;.", "&quot;We must be able to stop the terrorism and fundamentalism that can reach us from the east at the Jordan line and not in the suburbs of Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/israel-prime-minister-kurdish-independence"}, {"tags": ["Iraq", "Nouri al-Maliki", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Iraq&apos;s feuding politicians will come under intense pressure on Tuesday to nominate the first of three leaders who could bring together a government and help stabilise the country. A parliamentary speaker is due to be nominated at a meeting of MPs, in the wake of a lightning offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) that has seized control of at least a third of the country. The nomination of a speaker could pave the way for the naming of a new president, the second of three pillars of the executive. However, the most contentious position \u2013 that of prime minister \u2013 remains undecided. Under Iraq&apos;s constitution, most executive authority rests with the prime minister. The incumbent, Nouri al-Maliki, is facing a seemingly losing battle to convince legislators that he can reunite disparate interests across the political spectrum. Maliki had been banking on a military assault on the insurgent-held city of Tikrit to give him impetus. But after days of intense battles against a much smaller enemy, on Monday night government forces were no closer to retaking the city \u2013 the birthplace of Saddam Hussein \u2013 or key energy installations to the north. Isis threw down the gauntlet to Iraq&apos;s leaders on Sunday, announcing it had reimposed a caliphate that spanned the border with Syria, linking Aleppo to Diyala province 60 miles north of Baghdad. The announcement signalled that the two-week rout of the Iraqi military in the north and west of the country had dramatically emboldened the jihadis to the point of acting out goals they had stated for the past seven years. The previous incarnation of the group, the Islamic State of Iraq, tried to restore a caliphate centred on Diyala in 2007, but was beaten back by the US military and local tribes. Isis is now clearly in the ascendancy, standing its ground against a well-equipped but seriously underperforming military, and co-opting some of Iraq&apos;s Sunni communities by tapping into their fears or their sense of estrangement from the state. Isis seized Tikrit by allying with a network of former Baathists who had remained an underground threat to post-Saddam Iraq ever since their leader was ousted. But the alliance already appears to be fraying, with the Baathists remaining blood-and-soil nationalists in the face of the jihadists&apos; aims to eradicate Iraq&apos;s borders and impose hardline Islamic rule. Failure to stop the group&apos;s momentum in Tikrit and elsewhere appears to have made Maliki&apos;s position even less certain. The National Alliance \u2013 a grouping of Shia blocs to which he belongs \u2013 was understood over the weekend to be wavering in its support for him. &quot;He knows this,&quot; an influential member of the group told the Guardian. &quot;But in the Arab world, leaders who have been forced to stand down either end up in prison, in exile or dead. That cannot happen this time. He has been told that his time is up. It is just a matter of him accepting it.&quot; A second Shia leader, who also refused to be named, said the National Alliance had chosen a list of eight candidates, none of whom were Maliki&apos;s. &quot;All of them are being considered by Iran,&quot; he said. &quot;There are many people who need to sign off on this. But everyone understands the urgency.&quot; While not making its military support conditional on Maliki quitting, the US has been reluctant to order air strikes against Isis targets in the absence of political unity. US advisers are understood to be active in some battle zones, including Tikrit, while others have been preparing target lists in case Barack Obama gives an attack order. Unidentified fighter jets have been heard above Baghdad in the past 48 hours and Iraq has taken delivery of the first of 12 ageing Russian fighters that will take at least five days to reassemble and make airworthy. Drones have also been reported over Baghdad and the western border regions, although the US has strongly denied that its aircraft have fired missiles. In the meantime, Iraq&apos;s existing air force is making heavy going of the battle below, with more than 60 of its helicopters hit since January and seven shot down. The collapse of the Iraqi military around Mosul and Kirkuk has led the Kurds of the country&apos;s north to take lead positions, and has been a boost for the their long-held aspirations of sovereignty.

An Israeli woman with a photo of the teenagers at a rally in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    Eyal Yifrach, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Frankel, 16, went missing while hitchhiking back from their religious schools in settlements on the West Bank on 10 June. According to reports in the Israeli media on Monday it appeared the three were killed shortly after being abducted near the Gush Etzion junction in the southern West Bank. The same reports suggested they were shot in the car they got into, which was later discovered abandoned and burned out. &quot;There can be no forgiveness for the killers of children and those who sent them. Now is the time to act,&quot; Israel&apos;s economy minister, Naftali Bennett, said in a statement. Separately, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called an emergency meeting to discuss the killings. A senior Hamas spokesman, however, denied the group&apos;s involvement. &quot;Only the Israeli version of the events has been published,&quot; said Sami Abu Zuhri. &quot;Israel is attempting to make way for aggression against us, against the Hamas \u2026 No Palestinian group, Hamas or any other group, has taken responsibility for the action, and thus the Israeli version can&apos;t be trusted.&quot; The hunt for the three missing youths has seen several hundred Palestinians rounded up in a massive operation \u2013 often without charge or connection to the kidnapping \u2013 and five Palestinians, including a number of minors, killed. The official announcement by the Israeli military and the Shin Bet security agency that the bodies had been found followed hours of swirling rumours in Israel where the hunt for the missing youths has galvanised Israeli society, prompting round-the-clock coverage and large rallies \u2013 the most recent in Tel Aviv on Sunday \u2013 calling for their release. An army spokesman said the bodies had been buried in a field near the village of Halhul just north of one of the entrances to Hebron. Binyamin Proper, who was among the civilian volunteers who found the bodies, told Channel 2 TV that a member of the search party &quot;saw something suspicious on the ground, plants that looked out of place, moved them and moved some rocks and then found the bodies. We realised it was them and we called the army.&quot; Outside the home of Eyal Yifrach, one of the missing teenagers, the street was packed with Orthodox Jews, standing behind a police barricade and listening to the news on the radio. An elderly woman who declined to give her name to the Guardian wept as she spoke of the deaths of the teenagers. &quot;We need to do to them as they have done to us,&quot; she said. &quot;We see lots of Arabs in the malls, in the shops. We don&apos;t do what they do. They used to eat with us and now they kill us.&quot; Yvette, 36, a neighbour, said: &quot;When the Arabs are doing the killing the world stays silent, it is always Israel [who is criticised].&quot; On the streets surrounding the neighbourhood, families stood on balconies. Everyone was listening to a radio. TV cameras were directly outside the Yifrach house, which was closed off. The case prompted a massive manhunt by soldiers, police and members of Israel&apos;s domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet. As the search went on concerns mounted for the teenagers&apos; safety, amid pointed and grim reminders in the Israeli media that West Bank kidnapping victims historically have often been killed shortly after their abduction. The abduction of the three youths has also become a heated political issue both on the domestic and international political front, with Palestinian leaders accusing the Israeli government of using it as an excuse to smash the new Palestinian unity government backed by Hamas. However, even within Palestinian circles close to Abbas, concerns had been growing over the potential fallout that would follow the revelation that the teenagers had been kidnapped or killed by militants associated with \u2013 or members of \u2013 Hamas, with one official telling the Guardian the unity government would be dead in the water. US President Barack Obama condemned what he called the &quot;senseless&quot; murder of the teenagers and warned against actions that could further &quot;destabilise&quot; the situation. &quot;The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms this senseless act of terror against innocent youth,&quot; Obama said in a written statement. In a statement issue by his office British prime minister David Cameron said: &quot;I am deeply saddened by the news that the bodies of the three Israeli boys ... have been found ... This was an appalling and inexcusable act of terror perpetrated against young teenagers. Britain will stand with Israel as it seeks to bring to justice those responsible.&quot; In Nof Ayalon, where Naftali Frankel lived, groups of friends, family and neighbours of the 16-year-old walked arm and arm through the quiet streets. The contrast as the residents gathered at the local synagogue was palpable to El Ad a short drive away. Both male and female sides of the synagogue were packed but largely quiet, unlike the scenes at the Yifrach neighbourhood. A 16-year-old fellow student of Frankel, sitting outside on a bench smoking, said that although many had criticised the three students for hitchhiking, he knew many pupils at the yeshiva they attended and the killings would not stop him or them from doing it. &quot;I am mad, but I am not going to get too excited about it,&quot; he said.

In an article for the Nation, Chomsky courts controversy by arguing that parallels drawn between campaigns against Israel and apartheid-era South Africa are misleading and that a misguided strategy could damage rather than help Israel&apos;s victims. Chomsky&apos;s target is the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement, which has made significant strides in recent years. It calls for an end to Israel&apos;s occupation of Arab lands conquered in 1967 and the dismantling of its West Bank wall; recognising the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. Chomsky says that while there is wide international support for the first two goals, there is only negligible backing beyond the BDS movement itself for the return of the 1948 refugees \u2013 a key Palestinian demand. Insistence on that, he says, &quot;is a virtual guarantee of failure&quot;. Against a background of bitter arguments over BDS activity on US university campuses, Chomsky invokes the &quot;glass house&quot; principle, writing that if Tel Aviv University is boycotted because Israel violates human rights at home, &quot;then why not boycott Harvard because of far greater violations by the US?&quot; He also questions the &quot;very dubious&quot; analogy made by BDS between sanctions against Israel and sanctions against apartheid South Africa. By 1960, global investors had already abandoned South Africa, says Chomsky, though some historians dispute the claim. Today, by contrast, US investment is flowing into Israel. &quot;While there is \u2026 a growing domestic opposition in the US to Israeli crimes, it does not remotely compare with the South African case,&quot; he writes. &quot;The necessary educational work has not been done. Spokespeople for the BDS movement may believe they have attained their &apos;South African moment&apos;, but that is far from accurate. And if tactics are to be effective, they must be based on a realistic assessment of actual circumstances.&quot; Similar arguments are deployed against the invocation of apartheid. &quot;Within Israel, discrimination against non-Jews is severe; the land laws are just the most extreme example. But it is not South African-style apartheid. In the occupied territories, the situation is far worse than it was in South Africa, where the white nationalists needed the black population: it was the country&apos;s workforce, and as grotesque as the bantustans were, the nationalist government devoted resources to sustaining and seeking international recognition for them. &quot;In sharp contrast, Israel wants to rid itself of the Palestinian burden. The road ahead is not toward South Africa, as commonly alleged, but toward something much worse.&quot; Chomsky expresses support for the boycott of products from Israeli settlements in the occupied territories \u2013 a strategy enhanced by an EU policy shift last year that was welcomed by pro-Palestinian activists. South Africa&apos;s freedom struggle, Chomsky recalls, was helped by Cuban military and soft power, as Nelson Mandela gratefully acknowledged. But as the Palestinians have no such saviour, he concludes, &quot;those who are sincerely dedicated to the Palestinian cause should avoid illusion and myth, and think carefully about the tactics they choose and the course they follow.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2014 to clarify that a remark about global investors abandoning South Africa was part of a paraphrasing of Noam Chomsky&apos;s argument.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T16:21:00Z", "title": "Israel boycott campaign risks backfiring, says Noam Chomsky", "sentences": ["Against a background of bitter arguments over BDS activity on US university campuses, Chomsky invokes the &quot;glass house&quot; principle, writing that if Tel Aviv University is boycotted because Israel violates human rights at home, &quot;then why not boycott Harvard because of far greater violations by the US?&quot; He also questions the &quot;very dubious&quot; analogy made by BDS between sanctions against Israel and sanctions against apartheid South Africa."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/bds-boycott-campaign-israel-noam-chomsky"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Thousands of Palestinian mourners carried the burned body of 17-year Mohammed Abu Khdeir through the streets of an East Jerusalem suburb on Friday.

The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, swiftly issued a statement denouncing Jewish extremism as &quot;terrorism&quot; after the arrests in the early hours. &quot;We do not distinguish terror from terror,&quot; he said. The suspects, including some minors, are being held by the Shin Bet security agency. They are being represented by lawyers hired by a rightwing legal action group. The news of the arrests broke after Israeli media reported that police had made a breakthrough in the investigation and had concluded that the killing was &quot;nationalist&quot; in motivation rather than criminal. &quot;Apparently the people arrested in relation to the case belong to an extremist Jewish group,&quot; an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Palestinians have insisted for days that Mohamed Abu Khdeir was the victim of far-right Jews avenging the killing of three Israeli teenagers who disappeared while hitchhiking in the occupied West Bank on 12 June and whose bodies were found on Monday. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of Naftali Frankel and Gil-ad Sha&apos;er, both 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19. The killings have prompted days of riots and raised concerns of a new Palestinian uprising, or intifada. Speaking after visiting the parents of the Israeli teenagers, Netanyahu said: &quot;I would like to send my condolences to the Abu Khdeir family. I pledge that the perpetrators of this horrific crime will face the full weight of the law. I know that in our society, the society of Israel, there is no place for such murderers. And that&apos;s the difference between us and our neighbours. They consider murderers to be heroes. They name public squares after them. We don&apos;t. We condemn them and we put them on trial and we&apos;ll put them in prison.&quot; Israel said its aircraft attacked 10 sites in Gaza overnight on Saturday in response to multiple rocket strikes on southern Israel. Hamas&apos;s armed wing said seven of its fighters had been killed in a separate Israeli airstrike. Following news of the arrests, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, sent a letter to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, asking the UN to investigate &quot;terror crimes conducted against our people, including the burning alive of Mohamed Abu Khdeir&quot;. Few concrete details of the arrests were available, with Israeli media reporting on the case still covered by a gag order. Sources said some of those arrested had been involved in a violent demonstration on the evening prior to the killing organised by La Familia, a racist group of supporters of Beitar Jerusalem football club. Participants in the protest chanted &quot;death to Arabs&quot; and attacked Palestinian passersby. Some of those arrested are believed to be known to police and to have criminal records. The father of the murdered boy, Hussein Abu Khdeir, complained that he had been told nothing by police. According to a report on Israel&apos;s Channel 2, the suspects are being investigated for alleged links to two cars, one believed to have been used in the Abu Khdeir killing and in the attempted kidnapping of another boy, Musa Zalloum, two days before. According to the broadcaster, days before Abu Khdeir&apos;s murder, some of the suspects allegedly scouted the area in East Jerusalem where the teenager lived, attempting unsuccessfully to kidnap Zalloum. Footage has emerged showing the faces of possible suspects in the abduction. The footage, acquired by the website Electronic Intifada, which champions Palestinian issues, appears to replicate video shot from another angle that was acquired by the Guardian on Friday and which Abu Khdeir&apos;s family says depicts the moment of his abduction.

As part of a new offensive dubbed &quot;Operation Protective Edge&quot;, Israeli troops have been mobilised along the Gaza border and a limited number of reserves called up for a possible ground invasion. The strikes came after Israeli army sources said troops were being put on notice of &quot;preparation for escalation&quot;. The Guardian saw columns of tank and armoured personnel carriers moving along the main highway between Jersualem and Erez, on the Gaza border. Rocket attacks from Gaza \u2013 initially from Islamic factions other than Hamas \u2013 have been increasing in recent weeks against the backdrop of a major Israeli operation against Hamas on the West Bank following the kidnapping and murder of three teenagers whose bodies were found last week. Air strikes by Israel, both following the discovery of the bodies and in response to rocket fire, have escalated in recent days despite assessments by analysts in Gaza and Israel that neither Hamas nor Israel wants a prolonged or bloody conflict. Despite the continuing rocket fire, Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, had shown a marked reluctance to be drawn into a military operation, offering Hamas &quot;quiet for quiet&quot; despite increasing political pressure from hardliners in his cabinet. The Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, on Monday formally announced his party was ending its partnership with Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party over the Gaza issue. But despite this alleged government reluctance, the army has reportedly been ordered to prepare a significant expansion of its operation.

We are preparing further steps and a gradual expansion of our order of battle.&quot; Nearly 300 rockets and mortars have been fired at Israel in recent weeks, including 80 projectiles on Monday alone, the Israeli army said. Israel has responded with dozens of air strikes in which eight Palestinian militants were killed on Monday, seven of them in a tunnel in an incident Israel claims occurred when Hamas members accidentally detonated their own explosives. In a comment piece in Yediot Ahronot, Israeli journalist Alex Fishman suggested: &quot;As far as it is concerned, Hamas&apos; going ballistic over Israel will position it anew as a relevant player in the region and relieve it from its political and economic troubles. The leaders of Hamas are no longer discussing a ceasefire. They are trying to ride the wave of violence by Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the West Bank with the purpose of garnering the support of the entire Palestinian public. And the solution for hitting Hamas without paying a price has not yet been invented, whether in the Israeli home front or in the international arena.&quot; Israeli army spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said: &quot;They [Hamas] chose the direction of escalation. So the mission will go on as long as we feel it is necessary to carry it out. We don&apos;t expect it to be a short mission on our behalf.&quot; Some analysts have suggested Hamas has been actively seeking to draw Israel into a ground conflict in Gaza. As Operation Protective Edge launched, sirens sounded over large areas of Israel&apos;s south and air raid shelters were opened. Among 50 sites the army said it targeted early on Tuesday were four houses belonging to militants, three militant compounds, 18 concealed rocket launchers, and other militant infrastructure sites. Most were targeted in air strikes, and three were attacked from the sea. Gaza health official Ashraf Al-Kedra said at least nine Palestinian civilians were brought to a Gaza hospital with light to moderate injuries, including several suffering from shock. He said some of the injured Palestinians were treated and released. Lerner said the army would gradually increase its attacks on Hamas in Gaza, and is recruiting additional reservists for a potential ground invasion. Hamas has amassed about 10,000 rockets, including longer range missiles that can reach &quot;up to Tel Aviv and beyond&quot;, Lerner said, adding that Israel was preparing for the possibility that Hamas would launch rockets towards the city&apos;s commercial and cultural hub. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2014.

Israel announced it had authorised the call-up of up to 40,000 reservists for a possible ground operation, even as it began moving convoys of additional tanks and other armour to the Gaza border. &quot;We have been instructed by the political echelon to hit Hamas hard,&quot; General Moti Almoz, the chief military spokesman, told army radio. He said the action would take place in stages. The announcement came as explosions boomed across the Gaza Strip, sending plumes of grey smoke into the sky and shaking buildings in streets already largely emptied of people. From the other side, armed factions in Gaza fired about 140 rockets into southern Israel on Tuesday. There were no reports of deaths from the rocket attacks. The Israeli military, threatening a long-term offensive, hit more than 150 sites and said that Operation Protective Edge aimed to strike Hamas and end the rocket fire that has intensified and reached deeper into Israel in recent weeks. &quot;We will not tolerate rocket fire on Israel&apos;s cities, and we are preparing to expand the operation with everything at our disposal to strike Hamas,&quot; said Moshe Ya&apos;alon, Israel&apos;s defence minister, who announced a special state of emergency in the south of the country. In a nationally televised statement, Netanyahu said continued rocket attacks on Israeli communities would not be tolerated. &quot;Therefore I have ordered the military to significantly broaden its operation against Hamas terrorists and against the other terrorist groups inside Gaza,&quot; he said. &quot;I call on you to display patience, because this operation could take time.&quot; The White House condemned the rocket attacks against Israel. &quot;No country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians and we support Israel&apos;s right to defend itself against these vicious attacks,&quot; said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, called on Israel to halt the airstrikes immediately and appealed for calm. &quot;The Palestinian leadership is conducting intensive and urgent contacts with regional and international parties to stop the escalation,&quot; he said. The Israeli military said on Tuesday night it had foiled an attempt by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip to infiltrate southern Israel by sea, the first such infiltration effort in recent memory, a spokesman said. Lt\u00a0Col Peter Lerner said four attackers were killed after coming ashore on Zikim beach. After the worst outbreak of violence along the Gaza frontier since an eight-day war in 2012, the Israeli military said a ground invasion of the enclave was possible, though not imminent, and urged citizens within almost 25 miles of the territory to stay close to bomb shelters. The military said it had struck militant compounds, concealed rocket launchers and other militant infrastructure sites. Most were targeted by airstrikes, and three were attacked from the sea. In the most serious single incident, seven Palestinians including two children were killed and about 25 wounded in an attack on a house in the Khan Younis area in south Gaza. Residents said the house belonged to the family of a Hamas member and the casualties occurred when the property came under attack for the second time. After the first strike people had gathered on the roof of the house as &quot;human shields&quot;, hoping their presence would deter a second strike, the residents said. The Israeli military made no immediate comment about the incident. The military offensive is taking place against a background of rising tensions across Israeli and Palestinian areas following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers, which Israel blamed on Hamas, and a gruesome killing, believed to be in revenge, by Jewish extremists of a Palestinian teenager last week, which sparked widespread violent protests. In one strike, three Hamas members from the Qassam brigades were killed in their car at a crossroads in Zarkar, along with two bystanders, residents said. One of those killed was Mohammad Abu Shaban, a senior figure in Hamas&apos;s military wing. As the residents began to describe what had occurred, three further explosions detonated loudly, scattering them. A strike in the early hours of Wednesday on a house in Beit Hanoun in the north of the Strip killed six people, including a senior leader of the militant group Islamic Jihad. Hafez Hamad, two of his brothers and his parents were killed along with an unidentified woman, Gaza interior ministry said. That brought the death toll since Israel began its offensive to 22: Hamad, four Hamas gunmen and 17 civilians, including seven children. At Shifa hospital in Gaza City, Ahmad Arafat, 33, and Mohammad Abu Tawilah, 16, were being treated in separate rooms after being caught in a blast in the eastern neighbourhood of Shujai&apos;a. Speaking through a bloody wad of cotton wool after shrapnel broke his teeth, Arafat, who used to work for the Palestinian Authority but is now unemployed, said he hoped &quot;all of Israel&apos;s cities&quot; would be struck by missiles in response to the latest air strikes. &quot;God knows what is going to happen, but I want the resistance to hit Tel Aviv. We need suicide bombings against the Israelis.&quot; In a room a few doors down, Bashir Abu Tawliah was bending over his unconscious son Muhammad, 16, dabbing a dribble of blood from his son&apos;s broken nose. &quot;He was with his friends in the street when the strike occurred. They were very close. They weren&apos;t involved in firing rockets. What did my son do? What do I want? I want it to escalate. I want them to feel the same pain as we do. Gaza is Hamas. They can&apos;t dismantle Hamas without dismantling Gaza.&quot; Israel Defence Forces said on Tuesday night that 117 rockets had struck the country in the past 24 hours and that an additional 29 had been intercepted. Militants twice fired rockets at Tel Aviv, both intercepted by the &quot;Iron Dome&quot; rocket defence system. Hamas said it had fired a salvo of four rockets at Jerusalem, and two distant booms could be heard from the city&apos;s centre, but police reported no injuries. The army was also checking reports that rockets had flown north of Tel Aviv, which would be the deepest strikes ever carried out by Hamas. Netanyahu at first seemed unwilling to be drawn into a prolonged and bloody conflict over Gaza, offering &quot;quiet for quiet&quot; if Hamas halted its rocket fire. But the death of six Hamas members in an explosion in a tunnel on Monday prompted immediate threats of retaliation and escalation of rocket fire. Hamas, which has been badly hit by an Egyptian blockade that has closed the Rafah tunnels and halted the flow of goods and funds into the strip, might believe it could gain from a prolonged conflict \u2013 as the group did after Operation Cast Lead, the 2009 invasion of Gaza. &quot;We have repeatedly warned Hamas that this must stop and Israel&apos;s defence forces are currently acting to put an end of this once and for all,&quot; said Netanyahu&apos;s spokesman, Mark Regev.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-09T04:51:00Z", "title": "Israel pounds Gaza with air and naval strikes in move against Hamas", "sentences": ["&quot;God knows what is going to happen, but I want the resistance to hit Tel Aviv.", "Militants twice fired rockets at Tel Aviv, both intercepted by the &quot;Iron Dome&quot; rocket defence system.", "The army was also checking reports that rockets had flown north of Tel Aviv, which would be the deepest strikes ever carried out by Hamas."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/israel-pounds-gaza-against-hamas"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "BBC", "Media", "TV news", "Television industry"], "article": "&quot;Israel under renewed Hamas attack&quot;: this was last night&apos;s BBC headline on the escalating bloodshed in Gaza. It is as perverse as Mike Tyson punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that the child spat at him. As Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Tel Aviv-based Israeli human rights activist, tweeted: &quot;We are targeted by mostly shitty rockets. Gazans are being shelled with heavy bombs. We have shelters, sirens, Iron Dome. They have 0.&quot; There is no defence for Hamas firing rockets into civilian areas, and as sirens wail in Israel, the fear among ordinary Israelis should not be ignored or belittled. But the media coverage hardly reflects the reality: a military superpower armed with F-15 fighter jets, AH-64 Apache helicopters, Delilah missiles, IAI Heron-1 drones and Jericho II missiles (and nuclear bombs, for that matter), versus what David Cameron describes as a &quot;prison camp&quot; firing almost entirely ineffective missiles. Twenty-seven Palestinians are reported to have died in Gaza \u2013 and, mercifully, no Israelis have been killed by Hamas rockets \u2013 and yet the BBC opts for the Orwellian &quot;Israel under renewed Hamas attack&quot;. The macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life: here is the &quot;hierarchy of death&quot; at work. According to the Israeli human rights organisation B&apos;Tselem, 565 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces since January 2009, while 28 Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli security personnel have been killed. The asymmetry of this so-called conflict is reflected in the death toll, but it is not reflected in the coverage. And so it goes for the events surrounding the abduction and vile murder of three Israeli teenagers. What was not widely reported by the western media was that \u2013 in the raids that followed their disappearance \u2013 six Palestinians, including a child, were killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank. As Amnesty International put it, these were &quot;blatant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law&quot;. Perhaps our media will excuse themselves on the basis of motive: whoever killed the three teenagers intended to do so, while Israel only kills civilians unintentionally. Read, then, the report of Human Rights Watch, not an organisation that can be accused of being a den of lefties. Israel&apos;s actions &quot;amounted to collective punishment&quot;, it declared, because of &quot;unlawful use of force, arbitrary arrests, and illegal home demolitions&quot;. Human Rights Watch investigated two deaths and found &quot;there was no evidence that the victim or anyone in the line of fire posed an imminent threat to Israeli soldiers or others&quot;. On 17 June, 20-year-old Ahmed Samada was shot dead in Jalazon refugee camp, and yet Israel did not even claim to have come under fire; the same for 17-year-old Sakher Abu Aal-Hasan, shot dead on 21 June.

In footage of the incident released by the Israeli military, two figures are seen walking out of the surf on an Israeli beach north of Gaza near Zikim. At least four militants are then seen running over sand dunes apparently carrying weapons before being targeted and &quot;neutralised&quot; by Israeli missiles. The incident is being seen as evidence of the new capabilities of Islamic militants in Gaza, whose rockets in the past 24 hours have gone further than ever before \u2013 in one case landing in the city of Hadera, more than 60 miles (100km) from Gaza. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), said too much was being made of the assault. &quot;People are calling them commandos but I think that gives them far too much credit. Even the way they are holding their rifles and shooting; any commando will tell you that that is not very professional,&quot; he said. He said the IDF picked up the divers coming ashore at around 7pm and the incident was over within half an hour. Boaz Ganor, director of the institute for counter-terrorism at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said Hamas was imitating the techniques adopted by Hezbollah in Israel&apos;s 2006 war with Lebanon. &quot;Nothing about (Hamas&apos;s) policy is surprising. It was always clear that Hamas would try to accompany its rocket attacks with other techniques. It could be and should be dealt with by Israel \u2013 and it was, the attack was a failure,&quot; he said. Like Lerner, Ganor was not impressed by the capabilities of the frogmen. &quot;It is not that complicated. A few trained divers can swim two or three kilometres with an underwater engine. I would not overestimate their capabilities,&quot; he said. &quot;The only thing (about this latest assault) that has surprised me is the rocket that was fired 120km from Gaza.&quot; Hugh Lovatt, a project officer at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said there had been a number of reports in recent years of Hamas trying to infiltrate Israel using naval commandos \u2013 most recently in 2010, which was thwarted while the soldiers were still at sea and preparing to dive. He said prior to Hamas&apos;s takeover of the Gaza Strip, there were attempts by other Palestinian groups to infiltrate Israeli territory using landing craft \u2013 the most well-known being by PFLP militants coming from Lebanon and landing in Nahariya in 1979 and attempting to take civilian hostages. In 1987, two Palestinians infiltrated northern Israel using gliders. &quot;Since these kind off attacks require specialised skills, they have been rather limited in numbers and like any special forces it is expensive and time-consuming to replace casualties,&quot; said Lovatt. &quot;Nevertheless, commando raids \u2013 whether via the sea or through tunnels \u2013 are an important military capability for Hamas, allowing it either to take hostages (as with Gilad Shalit) or exact revenge killings for the deaths of their cadres.&quot; Rockets from Gaza were shot down by Israel&apos;s Iron Dome on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning over Tel Aviv, while the authorities in the city sent out information to all residents on their nearest bomb shelters.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-09T11:14:06Z", "title": "Israel claims to have foiled amphibious Palestinian assault", "sentences": ["&quot;Nevertheless, commando raids \u2013 whether via the sea or through tunnels \u2013 are an important military capability for Hamas, allowing it either to take hostages (as with Gilad Shalit) or exact revenge killings for the deaths of their cadres.&quot; Rockets from Gaza were shot down by Israel&apos;s Iron Dome on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning over Tel Aviv, while the authorities in the city sent out information to all residents on their nearest bomb shelters."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/israel-claims-foiled-amphibious-palestinian-assault"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Gaza", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Hamas"], "article": "     Binyamin Netanyahu has instructed the Israeli military to &quot;intensify even further&quot; its assault on the Gaza Strip.

Iron Dome is the air defence system Israel is using against rockets fired by Hamas from Gaza. On Tuesday, 117 rockets struck Israel, 45 of them targeting major cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as Hadera, 72 miles to the north. The Israeli army said the Hadera strike was the furthest that a rocket fire from Gaza had ever reached. Another 45 missiles were shot down by Iron Dome, which is designed to intercept rockets fired from 3.4 to 43.4 miles away. How does it work? First a radar scans an area for a ballistic motor or rocket. When it detects the missile, Iron Dome&apos;s software can determine its location and type. The radar tracks the rocket as it is fired and the software predicts the trajectory. If it is determined that the rocket will hit a protected area, where there are large numbers of people or something strategically important, it will be intercepted. For short-range rockets, that decision will be a split-second one. Tamir interceptor missiles are then fired from launchers on the ground. An interceptor can act independently even if it loses communication with the ground as it has its own sighting systems. Each interception rocket costs around $95,000 (\u00a355,000) so Iron Dome is not used against missiles heading for open ground. How successful is it? During Operation Pillar of Defence in November 2012, when Israel clashed with Hamas, 1,500 rockets were launched from Gaza at Israel. According to figures provided at the time by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Iron Dome destroyed 426 rockets, with a successful interception rate of 84%. Israeli officials hailed Iron Dome as a &quot;game-changer&quot; that saves lives, describing it as &quot;an extraordinary homemade rocket swatter&quot;. Some have questioned whether it is as effective as claimed, but Time magazine&apos;s defence expert, Mark Thompson, says the &quot;lack of Israeli casualties suggests Iron Dome is the most effective, most tested, missile shield the world has ever seen&quot;. Are changes planned for Iron Dome? Rafael, the Israeli defence company that developed the system, says it is being improved. An official for the company told IHS Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly in April: &quot;There is something in the pipeline, both in terms of hardware and software improvements. I can&apos;t say exactly what these are or when (they might be rolled out), but we are in a kind of race [with the Palestinian rocket firers] and we always need to update (the system) to increase the probability of a kill.&quot; Rafael has also collaborated with US firm Raytheon to develop a related defence system known as David&apos;s Sling, which is intended to stop rockets with ranges between 45 and 200 miles. Iron Dome receives $176m in annual funding from the US, but the House of Representatives voted in May to double the amount.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-09T15:02:44Z", "title": "Iron Dome: Israel's 'game-changing' missile shield", "sentences": ["On Tuesday, 117 rockets struck Israel, 45 of them targeting major cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as Hadera, 72 miles to the north."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/iron-dome-gaza-israel-air-defence-missile"}, {"tags": ["Australia news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "An Israeli legal centre has abandoned landmark legal action against a Sydney academic, Jake Lynch, over his support for a boycott of Israel. Lawyers for Lynch said they and a Tel Aviv-based legal centre, Shurat HaDin, reached agreement on Wednesday that a racial discrimination lawsuit against the academic should be summarily dismissed for lack of standing. They said Shurat HaDin would pay most of Lynch\u2019s costs. Lynch said he welcomed the news that Shurat HaDin had \u201ceffectively thrown in the towel\u201d. \u201cI feel relief, and also determination to now make the most of this, because it removes a possible excuse as to why people should shy away from BDS [boycott, divestments and sanctions] activism. We\u2019ve successfully got the prospect of court action off people\u2019s backs,\u201d he said. Shurat HaDin, whose mission is to \u201cbankrupt terrorism one lawsuit at a time\u201d, filed the lawsuit against Lynch in October, alleging that he had engaged in unlawful racial discrimination against Jewish people, businesses and organisations by refusing to endorse a fellowship application from a Hebrew University academic, Dan Avnon. Lynch, who is an advocate of the BDS movement, refused Avnon\u2019s request on the basis that Hebrew University has a campus in the occupied West Bank and had close links to the Israel Defence Force. The case was billed as major test of the legality of the BDS movement, which seeks to pressure the Israeli government over its continuing occupation of Palestinian territories and advocate for a Palestinian right to return. But Shurat HaDin suffered a major setback in April when a federal court judge, Alan Robertson, struck out key parts of its original statement of claim against Lynch, which sought to frame the case as a class action on behalf of all Israelis, and included plaintiffs who Lynch had never dealt with. Avnon himself was never a party to the case. Among the grievances alleged in the original statement of claim was that the BDS movement had deprived some of the plaintiffs of the chance to see the performer Elvis Costello, who cancelled a 2010 tour of Israel in protest at the treatment of Palestinians. All the original plaintiffs except for Shurat HaDin withdrew from the revised lawsuit, which Lynch said \u201cdoomed\u201d the case, because the legal centre was not a natural person and could not demonstrate how it was affected by his actions. Lynch said the agreement brought to an end \u201cthe quixotic attempt by Shurat HaDin to establish that any activism in the cause of [BDS] must perforce be motivated by some kind of anti-Semitism\u201d. \u201cThey were absolutely rock solid certain at the outset, but all their attempts to prove it in court and to amass evidence and argument to back it up have completely crumbled,\u201d Lynch told Guardian Australia. He accused Shurat HaDin of trying to paint his decision not to support Avron\u2019s application for a fellowship as a denial of employment. \u201cThe proposition put to me [by Avnon] was that I permit him the favour of putting my name on his application for the fellowship,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cI had no power to grant him or withhold it from him. He needed two signatures out of the academic staff of Sydney uni, which is somewhere north of 3,000.\u201d A solicitor for Shurat Hadin, Andrew Hamilton, did not respond to requests for comment. The Israel-based head of Shurat HaDin, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, told The Australian that Lynch had won on a technicality. \u201cWe are absolutely determined that Lynch committed an unlawful breach of Australian anti-discrimination law,\u201d said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner on Thursday.

The first strike hit a coffee shop in the city of Khan Younis, emergency services spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told Agence France-Presse, adding that six men were killed and at least 15 other people wounded.  The second, in Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, on the home of Raed Shalat, killed him and wounded several others, Qudra said.  Further strikes on two houses in Khan Younis killed seven people \u2013 three women and four children, he said. The Palestinian health ministry put the total number who died in the two houses at eight and said they were all from the same family, with five of the victims children. Dozens of strikes were heard slamming into the Palestinian territory in the early hours of Thursday as Israel&apos;s Operation Protective Edge, the largest military campaign against Gaza since 2012, entered day three.  On Wednesday 29 Palestinians were killed and Tuesday&apos;s toll stood at 21, bringing the total number of dead to 64. Hamas kept up its rocket fire into Israel and sent thousands running to shelters across the country.  The dead include at least 10 women and 18 children, according to an AFP count based on medical reports.  The overall toll included six militants killed in raids into Israel on Wednesday and Tuesday.  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of committing &quot;genocide&quot; in Gaza but the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned of even tougher action to come.  There have been no Israeli deaths so far despite Hamas launching waves of rockets across Israel that triggered sirens in cities as far from Gaza as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa.  There were no confirmed hits in the northern port city itself but media reports spoke of rockets hitting either open ground or the sea in the surrounding region.  Tanks were seen massed on the Gaza border and the office of the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, quoted him as saying that &quot;if the fire continues we do not rule out a ground incursion&quot;. This &quot;may happen quite soon&quot;, said Peres.  Israeli troops on Wednesday killed two Palestinians who came ashore on dunes close to the Gaza border, near the scene of a foiled assault on an army base the night before.  Troops killed four under almost identical circumstances on Tuesday.  The UN security council is to hold an emergency morning meeting on the crisis, with the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, due to give the latest about the situation on the ground, followed by closed-door consultations between the council&apos;s 15 member states.  The meeting follows a request by Arab envoys.  Ban called the new wave of violence &quot;one of the most critical tests the region has faced in recent years&quot;. &quot;Gaza is on a knife edge. The deteriorating situation is leading to a downward spiral which could quickly get beyond anyone&apos;s control,&quot; he said.  &quot;The risk of violence expanding further still is real. Gaza, and the region as a whole, cannot afford another full-blown war.&quot;      Aftermath of an air strike on a house in Beit Hanoun, Gaza, in which police said militant Hafez Hamad and five others were killed on Wednesday. Photograph: Mohammed Salem/Reuters    Ban earlier spoke with world leaders including Netanyahu, Abbas and Egypt&apos;s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as well as the US secretary of state, John Kerry. He condemned the rocket attacks, saying: &quot;Such attacks are unacceptable and must stop.&quot; Ban also urged Netanyahu to exercise maximum restraint and to respect international obligations to protect civilians.  The European Union and the US also called for restraint.  In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the executive committee of the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation is due to discuss the spiralling crisis on Thursday.  The escalation comes with Arab riots inside Israel over the burning to death of a Palestinian teenager by Jewish extremists.  The boy was murdered in apparent revenge for the kidnap on 12 June of three Israeli youths in the occupied West Bank who were subsequently killed.  Their abductions sparked a huge Israeli assault on Hamas&apos;s infrastructure in the territory and retaliatory rocket fire from the Islamists&apos; Gaza power base.  Three of the six Israelis held over the young Palestinian&apos;s abduction and killing last week would be released on Thursday, Israeli media said, raising the spectre of renewed unrest by outraged Palestinians.  The three expected to be let out of custody deny involvement in the murder, while the remaining three are said by authorities to have confessed.  The Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal demanded world pressure on Israel to end its campaign. &quot;If the world wants an end to the bloodshed it must put pressure on Netanyahu and his criminal gang to stop aggression against Gaza,&quot; Meshaal said in a televised speech from his base in Doha.  The Israeli air offensive failed to staunch the rocket fire by Gaza militants, which sent Israelis scurrying into shelters across more and more of the country.  Three rockets were fired at the southern town of Dimona where Israel has a nuclear reactor, the military said on Twitter.  &quot;Two fell in open areas; Iron Dome intercepted the other,&quot; it said, referring to the Israeli missile defence system.  The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Gaza-based Hamas, said it &quot;launched three M75 rockets at Dimona&quot;, referring to the Gaza-produced rockets with a range of about 50 miles (80km).  Early on Thursday the Israeli military said that during the course of the preceding day &quot;at least 82 rockets hit Israel&quot; and 21 were intercepted.  Israel showed it was preparing for a possible ground assault by approving the call-up of 40,000 reservists.

The Scottish cities have jumped 34 and 49 places up the rankings respectively since last year. &quot;This year, UK cities have surged in the ranking, mainly as a result of a strengthening of the pound against the dollar,&quot; said Ellyn Karetnick, UK head of Mercer&apos;s International Mobility Practice. &quot;The UK&apos;s soaring housing market has also had an impact, with added pressure on the rental market as many buyers face difficulties in obtaining a mortgage.&quot; She added: &quot;Glasgow and Birmingham have experienced the greatest jumps as they have had significant cost increases on goods and services and rentals.&quot; The most expensive cities in the world for expatriates are both in Africa. Luanda in Angola is the most expensive for the second year in a row followed by N&apos;Djamena in Chad.

Reports claimed that eight members of the same family \u2013 including five children \u2013 were killed in an air strike on two homes in Khan Younis, south of Gaza. A spokesman for the Gazan health ministry told Palestinian media that no warning was given and that most of the dead were children. Ashraf al-Qidra said the total number of Palestinians killed over the past three days now stands at 77, with over 500 people injured in the tiny coastal strip. There have been no Israeli casualties from the hundreds of rockets that have been fired by militants in Gaza. There are also claims that a missile was fired at a cafe in Khan Younis late on Wednesday night, where dozens were gathered to watch the World Cup game between Argentina and Holland \u2013 with six dead and 15 injured, according to AFP. The Israeli defence forces said in a statement that it had targeted hundreds of sites in Gaza and killed three Islamic Jihad militants. &quot;We aimed at 322 targets in Gaza overnight, taking to 750 the total number of Hamas targets hit by the army since the start of Operation Protective Edge,&quot; Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has refrained from launching a ground offensive on the strip, which was expected after tens of thousands of reserve soldiers were called up earlier this week. But he has defended the IDF&apos;s actions in Gaza despite significant civilian casualties.     Palestinian children inspect damage from Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip.

No country on earth would remain passive in the face of hundreds of rockets fired on its cities and Israel is no exception.&quot; He appeared to acknowledge the civilian casualties but claimed that the deaths were due to Hamas using Gazans as human shields, rather than the indiscriminate Israeli bombardment claimed by those in Gaza. &quot;(Hamas) embeds its terrorists in hospitals, schools, mosques and apartment buildings throughout the Gaza Strip. Hamas is thus committing a double war crime: it targets Israeli civilians, while hiding behind Palestinian civilians,&quot; he said. But international pressure is mounting as the death toll rises. The UN security council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis. The secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, said on Wednesday that &quot;Gaza is on a knife-edge&quot; as he urged Israeli restraint, as well as a halt to rocket fire from Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. &quot;The deteriorating situation is leading to a downward spiral which could quickly get beyond anyone&apos;s control.

In Jerusalem, the city council has opened hundreds of bomb shelters across the city, after four rockets were intercepted over the city on Tuesday night. But many have remained unused for years.

Last week the Department for Transport (DfT) issued tougher guidelines on airport security following advice from the US, warning passengers that all electronic devices in hand luggage must be working and charged up, and if they could not switch them on for security staff they would not be allowed to take the appliance on the flight. The DfT said that &quot;for obvious reasons&quot; it would not specify which routes were affected. However, it is widely assumed that the only affected flights are to and from the US. Ryanair and easyJet, which do not fly there, confirmed the new rules did not apply to all or most of their routes. Easyjet, which flies to Tel Aviv and North Africa, as well as through Europe, said it was aware the new regime affected some flights to and from the UK, and it would advise passengers &quot;should these include routes operated by easyJet&quot;. When asked to confirm that none of the airline&apos;s routes was affected a spokesman said: &quot;That&apos;s correct. No new measures have been applied to our passengers.&quot; A Ryanair statement said: &quot;Ryanair does not expect that these rules will have any effect on short-haul flights within Europe.&quot; The airline also operates flights to Morocco, but did not say whether these were involved. A DfT spokesman said the department had no comment on the budget airlines&apos; statements. He said: &quot;I&apos;ve seen the coverage. We&apos;re not talking about what routes or airlines or airports may or may not be affected.&quot; The airlines have been briefed by officials about which routes are subject to the checks, as their staff are involved in security procedures. Initial screening is done by airport workers but further checks can be made at the airport, by airline contractors. UK airports have reported no extra queues at security as a result of the new regime but are also declining to confirm which routes are affected. A spokeswoman for the country&apos;s busiest airport, Heathrow, referred all questions to the DfT. She said: &quot;They tell us what to do and we do it, and we&apos;re advising our passengers to charge all electrical items.&quot; Other airlines are warning all passengers about the potential checks. Another leading budget carrier, Monarch, which flies to Florida and the Caribbean as well as Europe, said it was advising customers in advance of flights to be prepared for the screening. British Airways said it was telling passengers the measures could be in force for any destination, as the DfT was not making the affected routes public knowledge. An extensive passenger briefing on the BA website urges those taking connecting flights to not run down power on devices on the first leg of their trip, saying airports have &quot;very limited&quot; charging points. Those who arrive for a flight carrying a device without power could re-book their flight or hand the electronic equipment to BA staff to be collected on return or sent to another address, the advice says. One of the curiosities of the new regime is that it also affects laptops, phones, tablets or other items bought at airports, even those purchased beyond initial security screening and in sealed packaging. A spokeswoman for Dixons Travel, which has stores at 12 British airports, said its stores were pre-charging electronic devices at airports with flights to the US, with staff then checking to make sure any purchased items were working. Customers were also being offered charging points for other equipment. She added that sales of chargers in airport stores had increased by 30% in the week since the new security system was announced.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-10T14:43:46Z", "title": "EasyJet and Ryanair passengers 'unlikely to face new security checks'", "sentences": ["Easyjet, which flies to Tel Aviv and North Africa, as well as through Europe, said it was aware the new regime affected some flights to and from the UK, and it would advise passengers &quot;should these include routes operated by easyJet&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/10/easyjet-ryanair-passengers-security-checks"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas"], "article": "Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were both targeted by rocket fire on Thursday as Palestinian militants launched their most intense barrage against southern and central Israel since the beginning of the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Many residents awoke to explosions that shook buildings even in the north of Tel Aviv, while air raid sirens sounded later in the morning forcing thousands of residents to run to bomb shelters or take refuge in the stairwells of their buildings. Later in the day a volley of rockets was shot down in the skies over the city. On the beach in north Tel Aviv, sunbathers and swimmers stopped to gaze at the sky as Israel&apos;s Iron Dome missile defence system intercepted rockets. Later on Thursday, residents of both Jerusalem and Bethlehem reported hearing explosions in the skies. There have been no casualties in any of the rocket attacks on Israel from Palestinian militants so far. Iron Dome has managed to prevent any rockets landing in Tel Aviv, but the first barrage this morning saw shrapnel fall over Florentin, a trendy southern neighbourhood popular with artists, musicians and writers. At the site where the shrapnel hit, residents&apos; feelings were mixed. Avi Benjamin, a composer, was sitting on a bench outside his music studio just a couple of metres from the bomb site. &quot;It is a surreal place, Israel, do you know anywhere else in the world where this would be normal?&quot; he said, gesturing towards the area where shrapnel had torn up some of the tarmac on a petrol station forecourt. Benjamin, 55, added that he was not frightened to live in the southern Tel Aviv neighbourhood, where a relative proximity to Gaza means rockets are more likely to land. He added that his concern about the war with Hamas was that a more extreme group could replace them if they were to disappear. &quot;It is not a problem to destroy Hamas, it is what comes after Hamas that worries me,&quot; he said. Enat Yitzrach, whose convenience store is directly below where the missiles were shot down by Iron Dome and faces the petrol station where the shrapnel landed, was less calm about the morning&apos;s events. She said she had just opened her store at 8am when the explosions started. She threw herself on the floor and waited, terrified, as the building shook and sirens wailed overhead. She recalls hearing a series of five explosions. &quot;It was horrifying. It was just lucky that right now is the holidays and that it was too early for kids to be playing. I&apos;m not only concerned for Florentin, but for the whole of Israel,&quot; she said. But while parts of Tel Aviv, including the trendy Jaffa port, were notably quieter than they usually would be on a Thursday afternoon, in much of the city life went on as normal. Buses, taxis and sheruts (shared taxis) filled the city&apos;s main thoroughfares and residents took refuge from the stifling heat in cafes and restaurants. Eytan Schwartz, a senior advisor for foreign affairs to Tel Aviv&apos;s mayor, Ron Huldai, said that Tel Aviv was ready should the situation deteriorate in the coming days. &quot;[We&apos;ve had] three interceptions over Tel Aviv in the past 24 hours, so the city is prepared for any scenarios. There might be more missiles. We know that our military believes that there is a long-range arsenal that is not being used,&quot; he said. The municipality had spent the last couple of days repairing public bomb sheltersand notifying residents of their location, he added. Underground car parks across the city are also being used as makeshift shelters should rocket attacks intensify. At the same time, Schwartz said that it was a point of pride for Tel Avivis not to allow attacks to change their way of life. &quot;I&apos;m not trying to underplay this in any way, it is a bad thing for communities to be under a threat of missiles. Having said that, life goes on,&quot; he said. &quot;Tel Avivis going out to a coffee shop is not just our lifestyle, it is our declaration \u2013 we are saying this is what we want to do and we will not allow anyone with a missile to disrupt that.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-10T16:28:45Z", "title": "Tel Aviv and Jerusalem targeted as militants intensify rocket attacks", "sentences": ["Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were both targeted by rocket fire on Thursday as Palestinian militants launched their most intense barrage against southern and central Israel since the beginning of the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza.", "Many residents awoke to explosions that shook buildings even in the north of Tel Aviv, while air raid sirens sounded later in the morning forcing thousands of residents to run to bomb shelters or take refuge in the stairwells of their buildings.", "On the beach in north Tel Aviv, sunbathers and swimmers stopped to gaze at the sky as Israel&apos;s Iron Dome missile defence system intercepted rockets.", "Iron Dome has managed to prevent any rockets landing in Tel Aviv, but the first barrage this morning saw shrapnel fall over Florentin, a trendy southern neighbourhood popular with artists, musicians and writers.", "Benjamin, 55, added that he was not frightened to live in the southern Tel Aviv neighbourhood, where a relative proximity to Gaza means rockets are more likely to land.", "But while parts of Tel Aviv, including the trendy Jaffa port, were notably quieter than they usually would be on a Thursday afternoon, in much of the city life went on as normal.", "Eytan Schwartz, a senior advisor for foreign affairs to Tel Aviv&apos;s mayor, Ron Huldai, said that Tel Aviv was ready should the situation deteriorate in the coming days.", "&quot;[We&apos;ve had] three interceptions over Tel Aviv in the past 24 hours, so the city is prepared for any scenarios.", "At the same time, Schwartz said that it was a point of pride for Tel Avivis not to allow attacks to change their way of life.", "&quot;Tel Avivis going out to a coffee shop is not just our lifestyle, it is our declaration \u2013 we are saying this is what we want to do and we will not allow anyone with a missile to disrupt that.&quot;"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/10/tel-aviv-jerusalem-targeted-rocket-attacks-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "     Israel dramatically escalated the scope of its aerial assault in Gaza on Thursday, hitting hundreds of Hamas targets as the Palestinian death toll, including many civilians, continued to rise. In two air raids, Palestinians reported at least 16 people killed in strikes that demolished two neighbouring homes \u2013 occupied by the same family \u2013 and a beachside cafe in the south of Gaza. Palestinian hospital officials put the death toll at more than 80 and claimed half of those killed were women and children. Some accounts of the death toll said it had passed 90. There have been no reported Israeli casualties from the Hamas rockets being fired across the border. Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner confirmed that Israel had struck more than 320 Hamas targets over Wednesday night and into Thursday morning, bringing the total number of targets hit to more than 750 in three days. Lerner said Israel had mobilised 20,000 reservists for a possible ground operation into Gaza, but will for the time being remain focused on maximizing its air campaign. A ground invasion is a high-risk strategy that would doubtless lead to heavy Palestinian civil casualties and endanger Israeli ground troops. Amid a rapidly mounting human cost, some in Gaza have been miraculously lucky even as their neighbours have died. Mohammad Halabi was drinking coffee in his living room when the two missiles came. A trim and well-dressed man \u2013 a salaried employee of the Palestinian Authority \u2013 said the blast took off the front of the building, knocking down another separating wall and blowing a hole through into a room where his daughters were. &quot;It was 1.25 am. I was in the living room drinking coffee with my wife. The three children were in the bedroom. I can&apos;t tell you if it was two missiles or three,&quot; he said, his face pale and drawn, still stunned that his family had survived a strike that killed eight of his neighbours, including four women. The target of the strike, Yassir al-Hajj, believed to be a member of Hamas&apos;s military wing, was not at home when the attack came. The Israeli media has reported that the al-Hajj family were delivered a warning shot before the strike, but there was no warning for Halabi or his other neighbours before the bombs flew in. Despite claims from the Israeli military that its strikes have exclusively targeted militants, health officials in Gaza say that half of those to have died so far have been women and children. Halabi said he had spent some $25,000 on an extension to his home a year and a half ago to accommodate his brothers&apos; family. In his living room, the armchairs are coated with a thick layer of fine grey dust; a picture, blasted off the wall, lies on the floor, its glass broken. In Halabi&apos;s daughters&apos; room, the narrow beds are scattered with rubble. &quot;Praise God, we were lucky! No one was injured in the house. But now we are staying with relatives. We have no choice,&quot; he said. Asked about his dead neighbours, the al-Hajj family, he explained: &quot;Everyone has an affiliation here. The man who lived there was Hamas. But not a senior leader. If he was, I would not have stayed living in my house. But that is no excuse for what they [Israel] did \u2026 &quot; In any case, it was not Yassir but his relatives who died, including two women, aged 22 and 59, and two young girls. Almost as bloody was another attack on Khan Younis that came an hour or so earlier. A group of young men, their homes without electricity, had gone to watch the World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the Netherlands at a small beach cafe \u2013 a basic place offering little more than a canopy and a generator \u2013 when they were hit with an Israeli missile. Nothing is left of the cafe now but a pile of sand, which on Thursday evening was still being combed by mechanical diggers looking for bodies. &quot;There was a strike further up the beach,&quot; said Mohammad al-Aqad, 23, who had been watching television in one of the neighbouring cafes. &quot;We heard a jet and then the missile landed. They were neighbours and friends.&quot; &quot;We only ask for help from God,&quot; said Mahmoud Sawali, who said he lost at least two of his brothers in the attack. &quot;I have two brothers who are martyrs, and I&apos;m looking for the third.&quot; The intensification of Israeli air strikes has been met with a increase of rocket salvoes fired from Gaza into Israel \u2013 the Israeli military said 442 projectiles had been fired since Tuesday, including nearly 100 on Thursday alone. Nine Israelis have been treated for injuries, dozens more for shock. Israeli casualties have been prevented, in part, by the interception of Palestinian rockets by the US-funded Iron Dome aerial defence system. The anti-missile system has intercepted at least 70 projectiles destined for population centres in Israel. The wail of air raid sirens has paralysed business in southern communities and sent hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for shelter in Tel Aviv, the country&apos;s commercial capital, where two rockets were shot down on Thursday. Offices and shops have remained open and roads are clogged with traffic. The rapidly rising number of Palestinian civilian casualties has prompted senior Israeli figures to defend their strategy of targeting houses in densely populated civilian neighbourhoods, where the risk of civilian deaths is high. Yigal Palmor, a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry, accused Hamas of firing rockets from &quot;within houses and streets and neighbourhoods which are populated with civilians \u2026 exposing these civilians to retaliation and to backfire.&quot; The Israeli military has said it will investigate both the strikes on the al-Hajj family home and the beachside cafe, but has not offered an explanation as to why it is using missiles in densely populated neighbourhoods \u2013 a policy human rights groups say violates international human rights law. According to Israeli media reports, the military intends to continue attacking the homes of senior militants. &quot;The military&apos;s successes so far have been very significant,&quot; defence minister Moshe Yaalon said on Thursday. &quot;We will continue until they understand that this escalation is not beneficial to them and that we will not tolerate rocket fire toward our towns and citizens.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-11T05:39:00Z", "title": "Gaza death toll rises as Israel escalates aerial assault", "sentences": ["The wail of air raid sirens has paralysed business in southern communities and sent hundreds of thousands of people scrambling for shelter in Tel Aviv, the country&apos;s commercial capital, where two rockets were shot down on Thursday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/10/palestinian-death-toll-rises-israel-escalates-aerial-airstrikes-assault-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Barack Obama", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Hamas", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israel&apos;s air campaign in Gaza may violate international laws prohibiting the targeting of civilians, the UN&apos;s top human rights official has said as the death toll of Palestinians rose to more than 100. As international pressure continued to build on Israel to end its four-day conflict with Hamas and Palestinian militant groups in the enclave, Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said the Israeli military must abide by international law. &quot;We have received deeply disturbing reports that many of the civilian casualties, including of children, occurred as a result of strikes on homes,&quot; Pillay said. &quot;Such reports raise serious doubt about whether the Israeli strikes have been in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.&quot; A Gaza health ministry spokesman said two Palestinians had been killed and three injured in an Israeli air strike on Friday that brought the death toll to 100. Rocket fire continued at Israeli cities, which have so far avoided deaths, and Hamas&apos;s armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said on Friday it intended to hit Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben-Gurion international airport, warning airlines not to fly to it. A rocket also caused the first serious Israeli casualty \u2013 one of eight people hurt when a fuel tanker was hit at a service station in Ashdod, 20 miles north of Gaza. The White House said late on Thursday that Barack Obama had phoned the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to offer to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. &quot;The United States remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 ceasefire agreement,&quot; the White House said. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said a ceasefire was &quot;more urgent than ever&quot; after an emergency security council meeting on Thursday. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has also urged Netanyahu to consider a ceasefire. Riyad Mansour, Palestine&apos;s ambassador to the UN, said: &quot;We call on the security council to act immediately to protect civilian lives, which are being lost and destroyed with each passing minute.&quot; But in a televised statement on Thursday, Netanyahu seemed to indicate that Israeli&apos;s military action in Gaza \u2013 named Operation Protective Edge \u2013 was far from over. &quot;So far the battle is progressing as planned, but we can expect further stages in future. Up to now, we have hit Hamas and the terror organisations hard and as the battle continues we will increase strikes at them,&quot; he said. Israel has called up about 20,000 reserve troops, and while there is still no indication of whether it will launch a ground offensive, shelling and air strikes continued on Friday. Overnight six Palestinians were killed in two strikes, including one on the home of an Islamic Jihad militant in Rafah, medical sources said. Witnesses told AFP the militant, Abdel Razzaq al-Ghannam, was not home when the attack took place, but five people, including a woman and a seven-year-old child, were killed. It followed an air strike on a house in Gaza City that killed 33-year-old Anas Abu al-Kass, who was described by Palestinian officials as a doctor and pharmacist. Medical officials in Gaza said at least 74 civilians, including 23 children, were among those killed since Tuesday. Despite the barrage of rockets targeting Israeli cities including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv \u2013 causing thousands to rush to bomb shelters for the first time in years \u2013 there have been no Israeli deaths since the beginning of this latest conflict. The Israeli military confirmed on Friday that 548 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel since the beginning of Operation Protective Edge, including one from Lebanon on Friday morning that landed near Galilee. On Friday morning, air raid sirens also rang out again in Tel Aviv, Israel&apos;s commercial capital, and three loud explosions were heard as Israel&apos;s Iron Dome missile defence system shot down rockets over the city for a third day running. &quot;Three rockets were launched at central Tel Aviv. All three were intercepted over the Tel Aviv metropolitan area,&quot; an Israeli army statement said. In Jerusalem, Israeli police deployed extra units in the Old City to deal with potential unrest after Friday prayers, according to a police spokesman. Access to al-Aqsa mosque will again be restricted to women and men over 50. Last week, there were riots in Shuafat, East Jerusalem, following the murder of 17-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was abducted from outside his home and then killed.

Israeli authorities limited access to Jerusalem&apos;s al-Aqsa mosque to women and men over 50, and extra police units were deployed in flashpoints across the Old City in anticipation of clashes with Palestinian residents. Israeli military and police officials told the Guardian that the end of Friday prayers and the Ramadan fast, as well as the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath, combined to create a potentially explosive atmosphere. But the main street in Shuafat, a Palestinian neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, was deathly quiet on Friday afternoon. Last week this area witnessed some of the worst violence in more than a decade following the kidnap and murder of Mohamed Abu Khdeir, who was killed apparently in retribution for the deaths of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank in June. The barrage of fire between Gaza and Israel, which has claimed more than 100 Palestinian lives, is an escalation of this violence. Sirens sounded across Israel on Friday as a barrage of missiles was fired from Gaza towards Ashkelon, Beersheba, Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion airport, Haifa and Jerusalem. According to the Israeli military, there were 44 before midday, most of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system. At least one rocket was fired from Lebanon. In a back room of the Ali Bin Abu Talib mosque, the imam Suleiman Abu Khdeir and his mua&apos;than, or prayer-caller, Ihab Abu Khdeir, said they regretted that the protests had not continued. &quot;We should have handled the situation with Mohamed better. If we had continued the protests, we could have prevented the war in Gaza,&quot; the mua&apos;than said. They said the war in Gaza had been planned by Israel following the abduction and murder of the three Israeli teens. &quot;They always planned to attack Gaza following the kidnapping. The death of Mohamed only delayed it,&quot; said Suleiman When asked whether they support the firing of rockets from Gaza targeting Jerusalem, which in some cases have landed only a few miles from their homes, everyone in the room nodded their heads. &quot;Even if they hit my house, I would still support them,&quot; Ihab said. Across the road from the mosque, Mohamed&apos;s father and uncle sat in the shade outside the family home waiting out the final hours of fasting before Ramadan. The house, which was inundated by journalists and protesters a week earlier, was now circled by only a handful of reporters with cameras. &quot;I believe they went into Gaza to distract from the death of my son,&quot; said Hussein Abu Khdeir, Mohamed&apos;s father. Both men support Hamas in the current conflict and are scathing of the Palestinian Authority and what they said were its efforts to prevent solidarity protests with Hamas and Gaza in the West Bank and Jerusalem. &quot;Israel has the backing both Egypt and the Palestinian Authority,&quot; said Saeed Abu Khdeir, Mohamed&apos;s uncle. And as for the rockets, neither Saeed nor Hussein were concerned. &quot;We were not afraid of Saddam when he was firing rockets here, we supported him \u2013 why should we be afraid now?&quot; said Saeed. Back in the mosque, there was a consensus. The people of Gaza had nothing to lose by going to war with Israel, Ihab said, and Israelis should be concerned about a new generation of angry young people. &quot;You destroy my home and destroy my life and then you wonder why I support Hamas. You take a six-year-old boy that is growing up without his parents because they were killed by Israel \u2013 all that boy will ever think about is revenge.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-11T17:22:48Z", "title": "Tensions high in East Jerusalem as violence escalates", "sentences": ["Sirens sounded across Israel on Friday as a barrage of missiles was fired from Gaza towards Ashkelon, Beersheba, Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion airport, Haifa and Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/east-jerusalem-israel-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "Israel has vowed no easing of its aerial bombardment of Gaza, which has killed at least 120 Palestinians, as a defiant Hamas rained more rockets on the Jewish state.  A charity for disabled people and a mosque in which Israel claims weapons were concealed were reported to be among the latest targets struck as the Palestinians and their international supporters began drafting a UN resolution calling for \u201can immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire\u201d. Diplomatic efforts to end the hostilities have gathered pace, with Barack Obama phoning Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and Washington offering to use its relationships in the Middle East to help end the hostilities. Early on Saturday, 16 Palestinians were reported to have died in a wave of Israeli air strikes as Operation Protective Edge entered its fifth day. Among them were two people killed in a strike that hit a charitable association for the disabled in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, and another three people died in an attack in western Gaza City. Another strike killed three in the eastern Tufah neighbourhood of Gaza City, the Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said. A mosque in Gaza was also hit, with Israel saying rockets were concealed there and accusing Hamas, Islamic Jihan and other groups of abusing religious sites to establish underground tunnel networks. Hamas said the bombing illustrated a hostility to Islam and gave the group \u201cthe right to broaden our response to deter this occupier\u201d. The overall death toll had passed 120, with 920 wounded, medics said. The Israeli army Twitter account said overnight strikes \u201chit over 60 terror targets, making a total of 1,160 since the beginning of Operation Protective Edge\u201d. Speaking at a news conference on Friday in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said he would not end the military campaign until he achieved his goal of stopping the Hamas fire. \u201cNo international pressure will prevent us from striking, with all force, against the terrorist organisation which calls for our destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cNo terrorist target in Gaza is immune.\u201d Despite international concern, truce efforts have been unsuccessful, according to Cairo, which has played a key role in mediating previous Hamas-Israel ceasefires. \u201cEgypt has communicated with all sides to halt violence against civilians and called on them to continue with the truce agreement signed in November 2012,\u201d the Egyptian foreign ministry said. \u201cUnfortunately, these efforts \u2026 have met with stubbornness.\u201d After weeks of rocket fire into its southern flank, Israel appeared bent on dealing a fatal blow to the Gaza-based Islamist Hamas. Ismail Haniya, Gaza\u2019s former premier and the most senior Hamas official in the coastal enclave, also ruled out any end to hostilities. \u201c[Israel] is the one that started this aggression and it must stop, because we are [simply] defending ourselves,\u201d he said. Israel said preparations were under way for a possible ground attack, with tanks and artillery massed along the border and 33,000 reservists mobilised out of 40,000 approved by the cabinet. The Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said on Friday that he expected a political decision on a possible ground operation within 48 hours. \u201cAt the moment we are dealing with the first phase \u2026 air attacks,\u201d he told Channel One television. \u201cI imagine we shall decide tomorrow [Saturday] or the day after on the next stage.\u201d Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, kept up a steady stream of rocket fire on Israel throughout Friday. Five rockets were shot down over Tel Aviv by the Iron Dome anti-missile system, the army said. The Brigades said their militants had targeted Israel\u2019s main international airport near the city. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck \u201cseveral terrorists conspiring to launch rockets at Israel\u201d but did not elaborate. So far no one in Israel has been killed. Two have been seriously wounded, including a man at a petrol station hit by a rocket. In northern Israel at least one rocket fired from Lebanon struck an open area near the town of Metula, prompting troops to hit back with artillery fire, the army said.The military believed a Palestinian group had fired in solidarity with Hamas, public radio reported. The Israeli military released an aerial photo of the mosque it hit, saying it concealed rockets right next to another religious site and civilian homes. \u201cHamas terrorists systematically exploit and choose to put Palestinians in Gaza in harm\u2019s way and continue to locate their positions among civilian areas and mosques, proving once more their disregard for human life and holy sites,\u201d said Lt Col Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman. The White House said on Friday: \u201cThere are a number of relationships the United States has that we are willing to leverage in the region to try to bring about an end to the rocket fire that\u2019s originating in Gaza and, as we saw this morning, in Lebanon.\u201d Spokesman Josh Earnest referred to taking steps as the US and Egypt did in November 2012 to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas. Kuwait called for an urgent meeting of Arab foreign ministers to discuss \u201cthe deteriorating situation\u201d in the Gaza Strip, its Arab League representative said, which could take place on Monday. Israeli strikes on residential buildings in Gaza brought a rebuke from the UN\u2019s human rights office over the number of civilian casualties. \u201cEven when a home is identified as being used for military purposes, any attack must be proportionate \u2026 and precautions must be taken to protect civilians,\u201d said spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani. A group of 34 charities and NGOs also called for an end to the fighting. \u201cMilitary actions by all parties must stop,\u201d said a statement signed by groups including ActionAid, CARE, Oxfam and Save the Children. Amnesty International called for the UN \u201cto immediately impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, Hamas and Palestinian armed groups\u201d and launch an enquiry into \u201cviolations committed on all sides\u201d.

The death toll passed 160 on Sunday on the Palestinian side, with no Israeli fatalities reported. The United Nations called on Israel and Hamas to end hostilities. Instead the violence escalated with more exchanges of rocket fire from Gaza and missiles from Israel. The Israeli air force dropped leaflets on Sunday morning calling for the evacuation. Israel&apos;s military spokesman said troops would begin a &quot;short and temporary&quot; campaign against northern Gaza sometime after 12pm local time (0900 GMT) on Sunday. The military said four Israeli navy commandos were lightly wounded in a shootout with Gaza-based Hamas fighters as they carried out a raid to destroy a rocket launching site on Sunday morning. It marks the first time the sides have directly clashed since Israel began a devastating bombardment in response to rocket fire. Hamas said its fighters had fired at the Israeli force offshore, preventing them from landing.  Both sides have dismissed calls for a truce and Israel has continued to build up troops along the Gaza border ahead of a possible ground invasion. The UN security council unanimously urged Israel and Hamas to respect &quot;international humanitarian laws&quot; and stop the loss of life. The 15-member council urged a return to calm &quot;and restitution of the November 2012 ceasefire&quot;, referring to Gaza&apos;s last deadly full-scale conflict. Israel&apos;s aerial campaign \u2013 the largest and deadliest since 2012 \u2013 saw strikes start early on Saturday, including one that hit a centre for the handicapped and another that killed two nephews of Gaza&apos;s former Hamas premier, Ismail Haniya. Rockets fired from Gaza targeted Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, with several intercepted over Israel&apos;s commercial capital and Jerusalem-bound projectiles hitting two southern West Bank cities. Hundreds of rockets have so far caused no Israeli deaths and many have been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system. An attack on the northern Gaza Strip hit a centre for the handicapped, killing two disabled women and wounding four, the centre&apos;s director said. &quot;They didn&apos;t understand what was happening and they were so frightened,&quot; Jamila Alaywa said of those inside the care home. &quot;They fired the rocket and it hit us without any warning.&quot; Later on Saturday night an Israeli warplane flattened the home of Gaza police chief Taysir al-Batsh and damaged a nearby mosque as evening prayers ended, killing at least 18 people and wounding 50, officials said. Hamas unleashed a barrage of rocket fire after issuing a rare warning that it planned to fire at the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Three rockets apparently targeting Jerusalem fell short, hitting Hebron and Bethlehem, the army and Palestinian security sources said, with no reports of casualties. Of four fired at Tel Aviv, three were intercepted above the city and another hit open ground south of it, the army said. Well over 500 projectiles have struck Israel during the conflict, and on Saturday evening two rockets fired from Lebanon hit uninhabited areas in northern Israel, the army said.Israel responded with artillery fire. Amid international efforts to mediate a truce the Egyptian government of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi&apos;s was in touch with both sides, his spokesman said. Sisi met Middle East Quartet envoy Tony Blair in Cairo on Saturday to discuss the crisis and later warned any escalation would cause further loss of &quot;innocent lives&quot;. Washington has said it is willing to &quot;leverage&quot; its relationships in the region to bring about a ceasefire.The chief diplomats of Britain, France, Germany and the United States are due to discuss how to achieve a truce when they meet in Vienna on Sunday. The Italian foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, planned to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories from 14-17 July and Egypt on 18 July, her ministry said. There has been little sign that either side is interested in an immediate end to the hostilities, which appeared to be ramping up over Saturday night. The Israeli army said it was sending messages to residents of northern Gaza &quot;urging them to leave their homes for their own safety&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s unsafe to be near Hamas,&quot; it said. On Friday Cairo said its efforts to mediate a return to a 2012 ceasefire agreement &quot;have met with stubbornness&quot;. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said on Friday that &quot;no international pressure will prevent us from striking, with all force, against the terrorist organisation which calls for our destruction&quot;. Hamas&apos;s Haniya sounded a similar tone, saying: &quot;[Israel] is the one that started this aggression and it must stop, because we are [simply] defending ourselves.&quot; The latest conflict unfolded after last month&apos;s kidnap and murder of three young Israelis in the occupied West Bank and the brutal revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager by Jewish extremists.Israel cracked down on Hamas, though the Islamist group declined to confirm or deny involvement in the abductions, and Gaza militants hit back with intensified rocket fire. Israel says preparations are under way for a possible ground incursion, with tanks and artillery massed along the border and 33,000 reservists mobilised out of 40,000 approved by the cabinet.

The raid came amid continuing speculation that Israel would launch a ground offensive in Gaza, a move likely to sharply increase the number of civilian casualties. So far, 166 people have been killed including 30 children, according to Gaza&apos;s health ministry. In the worst single incident of the conflict so far, 22 people were killed and 45 injured when two large Israeli bombs slammed into a house in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City where the city&apos;s chief of police, Tayseer Batsh, was sheltering. Most of the injured were returning home from a mosque when they were caught by shrapnel from the blast. Meanwhile, militants in the Islamist-ruled Gaza Strip kept up rocket salvoes deep into Israel. On Sunday Israel appeared poised to escalate its military campaign still further, leafleting a large area of northern Gaza and sending text messages ordering residents to leave their homes by midday in advance of a large-scale bombing campaign against what it said were rocket-launching sites in Beit Lahiya and Attatra. As the ultimatum drew near, hundreds fled Beit Lahiya, many heading to UN-run schools which were taking in refugees. &quot;They are sending warning messages,&quot; said Mohammad Abu Halemah, a local resident. &quot;Once we received the message, we felt scared to stay in our homes. We want to leave.&quot; A leaflet dropped by the Israeli military in Beit Lahiya read: &quot;Those who fail to comply with the instructions will endanger their lives and the lives of their families. Beware.&quot;      The 2am commando raid was the first time Israeli forces have set foot in Gaza since the beginning of the current campaign. Hours earlier, Hamas tried to hit Tel Aviv with long-range rockets in an attack it had flagged up widely in advance on social media. According to the Israel Defence Forces the raid, which set out to destroy nearby launchers, was &quot;accomplished&quot; and unconfirmed reports suggested three members of Hamas had been killed in the ensuing gun battle. Four Israelis were reported injured during the raid after apparently being spotted approaching and being engaged by waiting Palestinian fighters. Saad al-Dawla, the night watchman of al-Mathaf hotel, said he was sleeping when the commandos came to the beach a few hundred metres away. &quot;At the beginning we heard shooting from the Palestinian side. I got up and looked out the window and saw that there were people shooting from the water. Almost immediately an [Israeli] helicopter came and started shooting at the water as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Later I heard shelling from the sea and the sounded of a warship&apos;s siren. The whole thing lasted about two hours.&quot; Another local resident, who would only give his nickname, Abu Adam, said he had been woken by the sound of fighting coming from the beach. &quot;I was lying on the floor with my children. We could hear the sounds of shelling and gunfire and see the windows lit up by the explosions and the flares.&quot; Earlier in the evening 22 members of the same family were killed when two bombs demolished a house belonging to Majid Batsh, a cousin of the Hamas chief of police Tayseer, with whom he was sheltering. All that remained of the substantial building on Sunday morning were a few concrete stumps of the pillars that had supported it. A girl aged three was among those killed in the bombing. &quot;They were my cousins,&quot; said Mohammad al-Batsh, 20, a civil engineering student. &quot;I was coming home from mosque when I heard a huge explosion. At first I didn&apos;t know where the sound was coming from. The air was full of dust and smoke. It felt like an earthquake. &quot;When I got here, I saw destruction everywhere. The bodies were so badly burned I could not recognise anyone. Thirteen of the dead came from my cousin Majid&apos;s family. He was just a driver. There are five still missing including a pregnant woman.&quot; On Sunday, Palestinians with foreign passports began leaving Gaza through the Erez border crossing. Israel, which is cooperating in the evacuation, said 800 Palestinians living in Gaza had passports from countries including the UK, US and Australia. Ahmed Mohana, a US citizen, said he had mixed feelings about leaving friends and family behind in the Gaza Strip. &quot;It is very hard. It is very tough,&quot; he said. &quot;We are leaving our family, our relatives and brothers and sisters in this horrible situation. We have to do what we have to do.&quot; Israel has launched more than 1,300 air strikes since the offensive began, the military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said on Sunday.

The conversation turned to the then campaign in the West Bank against Hamas. He suggested a kind of normality about the situation. After all, he added, the Israeli military had been fighting Hamas for many a year. It was only later, thinking about what he had said, that his comment stood out, as did the question I should have asked; the question that should be answered not only by Israel&apos;s generals and political leaders but by Hamas&apos;s leadership as well. Why, in the midst of the third war of its kind since late 2008, does either side believe there will be a different outcome than the two conflicts in Gaza that preceded it, most recently two years ago? Because the towering, venal stupidity of the current conflict in Gaza is that it will change nothing at all. Despite the rhetoric from both sides, Israel cannot win, any more than Hamas can lose. Perhaps worse than that is the fact that many Israeli officials understand that a defeat of Hamas in the terms regularly trotted out to the Israeli public is not, in any case, in the country&apos;s interest, since it would allow the emergence and empowerment of other more radical groups. What we have witnessed in the past few days, in a conflict that has seen residential areas targeted by bombs, missiles and naval gunfire, is a conflict of limited and murky ambition \u2013 war as an act of retaliatory grandstanding and violence as a form of negotiation. On the Israeli side, Binyamin Netanyahu, despite being lukewarm about the operation in its run-up, has been pushed by the more hardline members of his cabinet to hit Gaza hard. In that respect, it has been a war of politics as much as Israeli public safety. The rocket fire out of Gaza, the claimed cause of the conflict either, did not come out of the blue. It escalated out of a growing tit-for-tat exchange that saw ceasefire violations on both sides, the worst of them being triggered by a night of heavy air raids that followed the discovery of the bodies of three kidnapped Israeli teenagers. There was also the massive clampdown on Hamas \u2013 blamed for the teenagers&apos; murders \u2013 on the West Bank that saw hundreds of Palestinians rounded up in night raids. Behind all that, however, almost forgotten now was another fateful calculation. Pushed again by domestic political considerations in his coalition, Netanyahu gambled \u2013 as the US-sponsored peace talks collapsed \u2013 that no peace process would mean a return to the status quo. But the absence of a peace process has brought a dangerous escalation of tension and conflict. From Hamas&apos;s point of view, the calculation has been equally cynical and short-term. Weakened by its increasing isolation, including the blockade imposed by the new, military-led government in Egypt, it has found itself in an increasingly difficult political and financial situation. Hamas has rationalised that inviting a conflict, while potentially bloody, will see Israel struggle to defeat it. For despite Israeli claims that Gaza is &quot;a hostage of Hamas&quot;, the truth is that a large enough percentage of the population \u2013 perhaps as much as 30% \u2013 supports it, enough to make that claim nonsensical. And Hamas has rationalised, too, that when ordinary Gazans are suffering under Israeli bombs, they are more likely to support it. Figuring that the war will end shortly with mediation, as previous wars have done, it has set out its stall of equally limited demands: a return to the status quo ante of the last ceasefire arrangement negotiated with Egypt in 2012; an end to Israeli meddling in the unity government backed by Hamas; and an Israeli cessation of hostilities. So what will this war buy with the blood of the all dead? Not an end to the conflict but a period\u00a0of calm for Israelis that will end again, necessarily, because the underlying conflict still exists. Politically, perhaps, it will guarantee that the febrile rightwing coalition of Netanyahu lasts another year or longer with him at its helm. And it will end as the last two Gazan conflicts have ended. Egypt, a historic broker of ceasefires in Gaza, will calculate a point when Hamas has been hurt enough and public opinion over its inaction is beginning to become damaging. It will step in with a deal that will see it talk once again, albeit in a limited fashion, to Israel \u2013 and at last to regulate a situation it does not want to see spiral out of control. Then this stupidest of wars will stop. Israel&apos;s tanks will pull back to their bases. The Gazan rocket teams will lick their wounds, rebuild their arsenals in the metal shops and commission new murals for the walls to sanctify their fallen dead in the public memory. And the civilian dead will stay dead, discarded pieces in a pointless game of chess.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-13T17:09:04Z", "title": "Gaza war is futile.

Even those who accept that Israel has a right to defend itself from incoming Hamas rockets can be appalled by the sight of a house razed by a double air strike that left, on one estimate, 22 dead and 45 injured. Afterwards, those on the ground did not deny that the Hamas-affiliated police chief of Gaza City was sheltering there, but asked why his extended family, including children, had to die too. Others ask similar questions about the target of an Israeli raid on Saturday \u2013 a home for the severely disabled. Even if Hamas was hiding personnel or equipment there, even if it was cynically using the home&apos;s disabled residents as human shields, are there not some acts which, even in the name of self-defence, exact too high a price? These questions are pressing in on Israel now, asked even by those who are receptive to the country&apos;s core argument: that any government in the world would have to respond to rockets fired at its civilian population. Fellow governments accept that Israel has little option but to reply with force to Hamas&apos;s constant fusillade of missiles. There is an acceptance too that the Hamas arsenal is no longer the makeshift or amateurish one of old but now includes some serious firepower, capable of reaching deep into the country&apos;s most populated areas, including Tel Aviv. The result is that you hear, in the world&apos;s foreign ministries at least, less talk now of Israel&apos;s actions as &quot;disproportionate&quot; than once you might. William Hague, who used the word to condemn Israel in 2006, has not used it this time. Even the most shocking fact of the past week&apos;s events \u2013 the asymmetry of the dead, which has seen more than 160 Palestinians killed, compared with no Israeli fatalities \u2013 can be understood to be chiefly a function of Israel&apos;s superior defensive infrastructure: Hamas would kill scores of Israeli civilians if it could. It&apos;s just that its missiles don&apos;t get through, while Israel&apos;s do. And yet, for all this new understanding, a stubborn truth remains: there can be no military solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The fact that this is the fourth such operation to quell the Hamas rockets in eight years, and that the intervals between the operations are getting shorter, underlines the point. Hitting Hamas hard does not solve the problem. It does not end the trouble. It merely brings some short-term quiet till the next eruption. Ultimately, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and between Israel and the Palestinians, will have to be solved politically and through negotiation. There is no other\u00a0way. That, though, is the long-term objective. For now, there is a more immediate goal \u2013 an end to the bloodshed and pain. Eventually, as in each of the previous three rounds, there will be a ceasefire. So why wait? If it is due to come in a week, why endure another seven days of death? Why not cease firing now? That will require outside help. The US is wary, having seen John Kerry&apos;s peace initiative fail. But the goal now is not a grand peace treaty, just a cessation to hostilities; that cannot be beyond Washington and its European allies, even if it will require President Obama to show some steel and lean heavily on Binyamin Netanyahu. Egypt has a role too. The new regime loathes Hamas, aligned as the latter is with the Muslim Brotherhood. It is in no hurry to help. But if President Sisi wants to win international respectability, brokering a ceasefire cannot hurt. It might also assuage some of the widespread anger among Egyptians over both the crushing of the Brotherhood and the Palestinians&apos; plight, if he were to give Hamas a ladder to climb down. Finally, Qatar is desperate to walk tall on the international stage, buying up European property and global sporting tournaments alike. It has real leverage with Hamas. It should use that massive financial muscle for good \u2013 and do what it can to bring quiet, if not peace, to Gaza and ease the pain of those who have already suffered far too much.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-13T18:19:04Z", "title": "The Guardian view on the conflict in Gaza | Editorial", "sentences": ["There is an acceptance too that the Hamas arsenal is no longer the makeshift or amateurish one of old but now includes some serious firepower, capable of reaching deep into the country&apos;s most populated areas, including Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/13/guardian-view-conflict-in-gaza"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Hamas"], "article": "At 9pm on Saturday, Palestinians in Hebron and other West Bank towns took to the roofs to watch what Hamas&apos;s military wing promised would be a missile attack on Tel Aviv using a new type of rocket, the J80. J stood for Jabari, the military&apos;s top commander, whose assassination by Israel on 14 November 2012 triggered the previous war. That was a clear sign of defiance by the movement \u2013 which maintains that, while it did not start the current cycle of conflict, it was determined to defeat the Israeli offensive. Hamas has always insisted, contrary to claims by Binyamin Netanyahu, that it did not know who kidnapped and killed the three Israeli teenagers whom the Israeli prime minister used as a pretext for his onslaught on the Gaza Strip. That was not the sort of operation Hamas would have carried out given that its goal was to secure the release of\u00a0Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Many Palestinians believe Netanyahu had been planning an offensive against Hamas for months before that kidnapping. After deadlocked negotiations with Israel prompted the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to seek rapprochement with Hamas, the indirect US and EU positive response to the Palestinian reconciliation enraged the Israelis. The offensive on Gaza was Netanyahu&apos;s last trick, having tried to cripple the new unity government and to block payment of salaries to thousands of Gaza employees. This may yet prove to be another disastrous miscalculation. As early as last winter Israelis were privately talking about messages from the new military authorities in Egypt to the effect that now was the best time to attack Gaza and unseat Hamas. The Cairo regime, which toppled the first democratically elected president in the history of Egypt, had been tightening the siege on Gaza by maintaining the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt and destroying the tunnels that kept the people of Gaza going while Israel imposed sanctions and a ground, sea and aerial siege. As always, Israel tries to convince the world \u2013 which is watching with horror the savagery that Israel&apos;s weaponry is exacting on Gaza&apos;s civilians \u2013 that it is only responding to Hamas missiles firing on its towns and cities. Yet since the last truce was brokered under Egypt&apos;s then president Mohamed Morsi, Hamas not only restrained itself but also tried to restrain other smaller factions from responding to Israel&apos;s frequent assassinations or missile bombardments. Everyone&apos;s priority was to end the siege rather than be drawn into a new war. Israeli leaders have justified the bombing of houses and killing of women and children by claiming that these civilians are used by Hamas as human shields. But the Israeli fighter planes did not even spare a centre for the disabled. Undoubtedly these attacks, which cannot be described as anything but war crimes, have been an embarrassment even to some of Israel&apos;s staunchest supporters in the west. The longer this military offensive lasts, the more damaging it will be for Israel and its western patrons such as the US and the EU. It is for this reason perhaps that President Obama quickly offered to\u00a0mediate a truce. British foreign secretary William Hague has made a similar offer, though his implicit hostility toward Hamas \u2013 which he said he hopes to unseat in Gaza \u2013 undermines his credibility as a mediator. And so too does his bias toward Israel, which, in his own words, seems to have an exclusive right to self-defence. The people of Gaza would ask Hague if they too are considered human beings with the right to self-defence when they are subjected to Israeli aggression. Yet the biggest difficulty for any mediation effort is the lack of an Egyptian leadership that could play this role. The current regime in Egypt is\u00a0more hostile to Hamas than at any time during the Mubarak era. Peace envoy Tony Blair seems to be embarking on brokering something with the Egyptians, but he has a despicable record of hostility toward Islamic movements. For now, Hamas is not saying much about any offer of mediation despite unconfirmed press reports that the Qataris or Turks might play a role. Yet it is clear that Hamas will not agree to any mediation unless its demands are taken into consideration. These include reactivating the terms of the previous truce deal, some of which Israel has constantly violated, and the lifting of the sea and aerial blockade. This war will undoubtedly result in many fatalities and massive destruction to people&apos;s lives. The damage on the Israeli side may be more of a psychological, political or economic nature. What is certain is that, like before, the war will only boost Hamas&apos;s popularity. And\u00a0it will bring a moral cohesion among all Palestinians \u2013 whether in Gaza, the West Bank or the worldwide diaspora. This will be most crucial in the emerging third uprising, the Al-Quds Intifada.

Some 30,000 people had bought tickets to the gig at Tel Aviv&apos;s Hayarkon Park \u2013 the singer&apos;s first Israeli show in almost two decades.

Hamas rejected the plan, continuing its rocket fire throughout the day and killing an Israeli citizen at the Erez border crossing, the first Israeli fatality of the conflict. The dead man was understood to be a civilian volunteer delivering food donations to soldiers in the area. An Israeli soldier was also lightly wounded. Attacks in the early hours of Wednesday killed at least seven Palestinians, Gaza health officials said, and destroyed the house of Mahmoud Zahar \u2013 believed to be in hiding elsewhere \u2013\u00a0in the first apparent targeting of a top Hamas political leader. The Israeli military said on Wednesday that it had sent out warning messages to residents in the northern Gaza Strip to evacuate their homes by 8am ahead of renewed attacks. The Palestinians&apos; Gaza interior ministry told people not to heed the messages and dismissed them as psychological warfare  The first Israeli death added to growing pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, from hardline cabinet colleagues to escalate the offensive. On Tuesday the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, advocated a &quot;full takeover of the Gaza Strip&quot; \u2013 effectively a re-occupation of territory evacuated by Israeli troops and settlers in 2005. &quot;Israel must go all the way,&quot; he said. His former deputy, Danny Ayalon, suggested Israeli soldiers were poised to invade Gaza. After an Israeli security cabinet meeting on Tuesday night, Netanyahu issued a statement saying the military operation would continue. &quot;Hamas chose to continue the campaign and it will pay for this decision,&quot; he said. &quot;Whoever tries to attack the citizens of Israel, Israel will strike at him. When there is no ceasefire \u2013 our answer is fire.&quot; Later, the Israeli military warned 100,000 Gaza residents to evacuate their homes or risk being caught in further bombardment. However, any escalation of military action will increase the risk of Israeli casualties and could lead Israel beyond its stated goal of weakening, but not annihilating, Hamas. Although most international criticism was directed at Hamas on Tuesday for refusing to join Israel in the proposed &quot;de-escalation&quot;, Palestinian sympathisers suggested that the Egyptian ceasefire plan could be a tactical ruse to give Israel cover for intensifying its military campaign. &quot;Hamas&apos;s rejection of the ceasefire gives Israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people,&quot; said Netanyahu as bombing resumed. Gaza was hit by at least 30 air strikes on Tuesday afternoon. The additional strikes on Wednesday morning pushed the total Palestinian death toll above 200. The UN described destruction in Gaza over the past eight days as immense, with 560 homes destroyed and thousands damaged. About 17,000 people have sought refuge in schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. The Red Cross said hundreds of thousands of people were without water after Gaza&apos;s supply was devastated, and warned of the risk of disease from contamination and overflowing sewage. Meanwhile, sirens sounded across Tel Aviv, central and southern Israel, warning residents to take to bomb shelters in the face of rocket fire from Gaza. The six-hour pause in Israeli air strikes began at 9am on Tuesday as part of a proposal unveiled by Egypt on Monday intended to lead to a full ceasefire and talks on a long-term agreement. Hamas rejected the plan, saying it had not been consulted and its demands were not being met. According to the Israeli military, more than 50 rockets were fired into Israel before air strikes were resumed. But there were inconsistent messages from Hamas. Its military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, robustly rejected the proposal as a &quot;surrender&quot;, saying &quot;our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity&quot;. But Hamas spokesmen in Gaza said the Islamist group had not received an official ceasefire proposal, and its demands must be met before it lays down arms. Mussa Abu Marzouk, a Hamas leader based in Cairo, said on social media that the organisation was &quot;still in consultations. The movement has yet to take an official position on the initiative.&quot; Hamas is deeply distrustful of the Egyptian regime, although Cairo has been a key player in brokering ceasefires to end previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has since outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas&apos;s ideological parent organisation. Hamas and other Palestinian leaders are also likely to be suspicious of Middle East envoy Tony Blair, acting as an interlocutor between Israel and Egypt. He is seen as a defender of Israel&apos;s interests. Hamas has set out its key demands for ending rocket fire, which include the lifting of Israel&apos;s eight-year blockade on the Gaza Strip, the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, and the release of more than 50 Palestinian prisoners recently rearrested by Israel after freeing them in exchange for the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, who urged all parties to support a ceasefire, said in Vienna: &quot;I cannot condemn strongly enough the actions of Hamas in firing rockets in multiple numbers in the face of a goodwill effort to offer ceasefire.&quot; Despite the resumption of action, Israel might be anxious about getting drawn deeper into a confrontation in Gaza. It might have calculated that its bombardment has achieved its goal of weakening Hamas. It does not want to deal a fatal blow to Hamas, for fear that more radical groups would fill a power vacuum. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 16 July 2014.

Among the residences targeted were those of former interior minister Fathi Hamad and senior Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar, which was destroyed. Zahar was said to be hiding elsewhere at the time of the missile strike. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has said he had &quot;no choice&quot; but to escalate Israel&apos;s bombing campaign. &quot;When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire,&quot; he said. The Israeli security cabinet met in the early hours of Wednesday to discuss a limited ground operation, an Israeli official has revealed. Early on Wednesday morning, Israel dropped leaflets and delivered warnings by phone and text that tens of thousands of residents of two Gaza City neighbourhoods, Zeitoun in the south and Shujai&apos;iya in the east, should evacuate their homes before planned strikes and head to the city centre. Among those ordered to leave were the patients of a rehabilitation hospital. But the hospital&apos;s director, Basman Ashi, said everyone would remain and that foreign volunteers had arrived to serve as human shields. Hamas&apos;s ministry of the interior has told residents to ignore the warning, calling it &quot;psychological warfare&quot;. Just before the leaflets were dropped shortly after 8am, Palestinian factions fired a salvo of rockets from Gaza. The leaflet said the aim of the evacuation was to &quot;to save your lives&quot;. It was the first time in the nine-day conflict that Gaza City residents have been ordered to flee although northern districts received a similar warning on Sunday. The heavy bombardment of Gaza, which has so far claimed scores of civilian lives, resumed on Tuesday afternoon after Israel warned that Hamas &quot;would pay the price&quot; for rejecting an Egypt-brokered truce plan and instead hitting Israel with scores of rockets. Hamas&apos;s armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, rejected the ceasefire deal \u2013 a proposal that addressed in only general terms some of its key demands \u2013 and said its battle with Israel would continue. But Moussa Abu Marzouk, a Hamas political official who was in Cairo, said the movement, which is seeking a deal that would ease the Egyptian and Israeli border restrictions throttling Gaza&apos;s economy, has not reached a final decision on Cairo&apos;s proposal. Rocket fire killed an Israeli man on Tuesday, the first Israeli fatality in eight days of fighting. In Gaza, more than 202 people have been killed and almost 1,500 wounded, Palestinian officials said, making it the deadliest Israel-Hamas confrontation in just over five years. Since 8 July, militants have fired nearly 1,000 rockets and mortars into Israel, and Israel has carried out about 1,500 strikes against targets inside the Gaza Strip, according to the army. The Egyptian proposal, initially accepted by Israel, had been the first attempt to end the fighting. The ceasefire unravelled in less than a day, a sign that it will be harder than before to reach a truce amid claims that Hamas had not been informed of the terms of the proposed deal in advance. According to Israeli media reports, it was not only the Islamist group that was kept out of the loop of deliberations between Israel and Egypt. Also excluded, according to a report in Haaretz, was Netanyahu&apos;s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, and minister for the economy, Nafatali Bennett \u2013 both of whom oppose any ceasefire \u2013 who claim they heard about the proposed ceasefire from media. The ceasefire terms \u2013 which Israel observed for six short hours while Hamas continued firing rockets \u2013 fell far short of the militant group&apos;s demands, including he lifting of the siege and opening of border crossings and freedom for prisoners rearrested in the recent crackdown on Hamas on the West Bank. Hamas believes it has little to lose by continuing to fight, while a truce on unfavourable terms could further weaken its grip on the Gaza Strip, a territory it seized in 2007. Underscoring that position, Gaza militants fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds at Israel on Tuesday, during what Egypt had hoped would be a period of de-escalation. A particularly heavy barrage came around dusk, with more than 40 rockets hitting Israel in just a few minutes, including one that fell on an empty school.

Fear not, you may be feeling bereft after the last month\u2019s passing but, if social reintegration doesn\u2019t appeal, then there is always recourse to the low background hum that, since festivities in Brazil started on 12 June, has been the steady, slow, relentless revolving of the wider footballing world. In fact you\u2019ve missed so much that the World Cup might, once you\u2019ve caught up, seem like little but a dream \u2013 in which case you should, at least, be wide awake for Sheriff Tiraspol v Sujeska Niksic \u2026 The Premier League transfer wheel turned slowly It did until last week anyway, when the deals involving Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Luis Su\u00e1rez managed for a few hours apiece to outshine anything happening in South America. Sweeter, though, are the transfers that go through in the dead of domestic football\u2019s World Cup night \u2013 when clubs attempt helplessly to regain fans\u2019 attention or, just as often, hope they will be too distracted to notice. Aston Villa have done a fine job of the latter, adding Kieran Richardson to their early-summer splurge while ensuring that the casual fan would still have to double-check which club he, Philippe Senderos and Joe Cole are all playing for these days. At that twilight hour moves such as Swansea\u2019s swoop for Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis can easily evade the senses and skirt round awkward questions involving Wilfried Bony. In general there is not too much to feel ashamed of at this early stage: Hull were content to tell the world about their spend of roughly \u00a315m on Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass, while West Ham seemed pleased enough with their \u00a33.75m acquisition of the Ipswich left-back Aaron Cresswell and a \u00a37m outlay on Anderlecht\u2019s powerhouse Cheikou Kouyat\u00e9. The free signing of Joleon Lescott looks like astute business by the new West Brom manager, Alan Irvine, who felt embattled enough to plead for time at his first press conference, while Newcastle can rest fairly certain that their new forward Siem de Jong, from Ajax, will serve them more effectively than his brother Luuk did last season. The transfer machinations that ran concurrently to the World Cup did have two comforting certainties beyond death and taxes: Southampton and Liverpool. The latter spent \u00a325m on the former\u2019s Adam Lallana, having already given them around a sixth of that for Rickie Lambert, while Liverpool also hoovered up Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Emre Can and Lazar Markovic, and remain poised for Divock Origi, the aforementioned Bony and another player from Southampton, Dejan Lovren. Ronald Koeman, who took the Saints job as the rest of us obsessed over Germany\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Portugal, has redressed some of the balance by signing Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pell\u00e8 from the Dutch league, but arrived too late to stop Luke Shaw\u2019s Manchester United move edging to its conclusion. United have, themselves, been busy enough \u2013 Ander Herrera consigning last summer\u2019s embarrassment to the past by joining from Athletic Bilbao \u2013 and Manchester City caused few surprises with the signings of Fernando from Porto and Bacary Sagna from Arsenal. The most left-field piece of transfer news from the last month? Spurs have yet to sign any one and have not even thrown many bones. But, in this month of all months, no one has really noticed. The Championship continued to split in two What Fulham really needed after receiving \u00a363,318,315 in television money in their relegation season was the promise that they would, in the worst-case scenario, double their money in parachute payments over the next four. They were kind enough to drop \u00a311m of it into the ocean while we were rapt by the knockout stages, spending a record fee for a Championship club on the Leeds United striker Ross McCormack. The Scotsman is, as Leeds\u2019 owner Massimo Cellino delicately put it, \u201ca bloody good player\u201d, but this madness \u2013 McCormack, 28 in August, scored 29 goals last season but topped 20 for only the second time in his career \u2013 is unlikely to end soon and another demoted side, Norwich, will not have spent lightly on strikers Lewis Grabban and Kyle Lafferty either. Anyone switching back on to the domestic game and expecting anything like a fair fight in Europe\u2019s fourth most-watched league is in for a battle between haves and have-nots that is becoming steadily starker than anything we see in the Premier League arms race. The music started playing in Europe If the Champions League music strikes up in Andorra la Vella while Belgium and USA are in the throes of passion at the Arena Fonte Nova some 4,593 miles away, does it make a sound? Perhaps a squeak, because 323 people were there to see home side FC Santa Coloma and Banants, from Armenia, kick off the competition that will be consuming our energies a couple of months from now. In total six Champions League and 78 Europa League matches have taken place while our eyes have been averted and, if the slowed-down goal average in Brazil has troubled you, take succour from the fact that they have averaged 3.2 goals a game. One of those goals provided a story that, in a quieter summer, would have been manna for romantics. Santa Coloma are relative Champions League mainstays if you tend to dig this deep, appearing in four of the last seven. But they had never come remotely close to qualifying for the second qualifying round \u2013 losing by at least three goals in each of their 10 European ties \u2013 and, despite winning that ethereal opener 1-0 at home, seemed to be heading out again when Banants went 3-1 up in Yerevan. Then their goalkeeper, Eloy Casals, who had been pushed up front for a 94th-minute free-kick, snapped up a loose ball in the box and fired them to an improbable victory \u2013 sparking scenes that are just as impressive for the Banants players\u2019 utter desolation. \u201cFrom now on I will think everything impossible is possible,\u201d he said. Testing that theory on Tuesday were Maccabi Tel Aviv, to whom they narrowly lost 1-0 in the first leg. Celtic, Cliftonville, St Patrick\u2019s Athletic and The New Saints have all joined them at this stage; six teams from UK and Ireland made it through the Europa League\u2019s early skirmishes but the Welsh teams Aberystwyth Town and Bangor City, beaten 9-0 and 8-0 on aggregate by Derry City and the Icelandic side Stjarnan respectively during World Cup rest days, must hope there was something just as compelling on the television. The kits weren\u2019t all right You haven\u2019t lived until you have attended a post-apocalyptic kit launch. Not now. These apparently come in \u201ctrilogies\u201d; Ars\u00e8ne Wenger worked up a decent enough Saruman in Arsenal\u2019s Thames-side jamboree, designed to mark their new partnership with Puma and manoeuvred expertly into some World Cup downtime last week, but the concurrent news of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s signing was a blessed relief to those who wonder whether a new shirt should be A Story. But kits are huge business now and Manchester United \u2013 who released their own new get-up in slightly more restrained fashion \u2013 have had to make a readjustment on that front after Nike announced that their 13-year partnership would be coming to a close. Cause for alarm? Not really: Adidas have stepped in with a deal worth \u00a375m a year that, if they are to keep things remotely competitive, can be launched only via a reinterpretation of Dante\u2019s Inferno on Salford Quays. Championship clubs don\u2019t yet launch like the big guns do but a couple of new shirt sponsorship deals can\u2019t be allowed to lie. Sheffield Wednesday will walk out emblazoned with \u201cAzerbaijan \u2013 Land of Fire\u201d this season, intensifying the cuddly Caucasian state\u2019s romance with the beautiful game, while Derby County\u2019s \u201cJUST EAT\u201d shirts should provide soul food if Steve McClaren finds slim pickings at the second-tier table. As for Blackburn\u2019s \u2026 Others kept on keeping on They may have fallen short in the second round against Belgium but the USA\u2019s World Cup was widely viewed as a triumph on and off the pitch: J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s team won hearts and minds with their battling spirit while the level of engagement, with Barack Obama and Samuel L Jackson among those moved to tweet their support, was beyond expectations. All of which should be good news for Major League Soccer and the league was not keen on resting on its laurels while World Cup fever swept the country. After a two-week pause that took in most of the group stage, competition resumed less than 24 hours before the national team\u2019s potentially decisive clash with Germany. It has rumbled on since: you\u2019ll have missed Bradley Wright-Phillips\u2019 late equaliser for New York Red Bulls against Toronto if you were catching up on sleep in preparation for Brazil v Chile and Colombia v Uruguay; the same player\u2019s double at Houston, in response to a Giles Barnes goal, was one way to limber up for Brazil v Colombia. The remorseless return of MLS has, at least, allowed players to get back in the saddle: Chris Wondolowski\u2019s goal for San Jose Earthquakes against leaders DC United on Friday night may not have healed the wounds of his glaring late miss against the Belgians but it can\u2019t have hurt. And finally \u2026 The 14-year-old schoolboy who caused Danny Coles to be sacked as Exeter City\u2019s captain and placed on the transfer list has called for an end to their feud. It all began when Will Wenley \u2013 a St Peter\u2019s School pupil and season-ticket holder at St James Park \u2013 saw a tweet from Coles that said England\u2019s Phil Jagielka was \u201ca car crash waiting to happen\u201d and responded \u201cso like you at Exeter\u201d. This prompted a foul-mouthed tirade from the defender, who told the fan to \u201cfuck off cunt\u201d. Unsurprisingly, Coles was forced to issue a swift apology but not before he was fined two weeks\u2019 wages, stripped of the captaincy and closed down his Twitter account. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d Wenley, of Pennsylvania (in Exeter) said magnanimously.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T09:23:00Z", "title": "What you missed during the World Cup: transfers, kits \u2026 scoring keepers | Nick Ames", "sentences": ["Testing that theory on Tuesday were Maccabi Tel Aviv, to whom they narrowly lost 1-0 in the first leg."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/16/world-cup-transfers-championship-brazil"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s cabinet is in disarray as the Israeli prime minister comes under fire from several of his most senior ministers for his handling of the crisis in Gaza. The storm of public criticism from within his own ranks led to the sacking on Tuesday night of the deputy defence minister, Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party. Danon had told the media that Hamas had humiliated Israel by setting conditions for peace, after Netanyahu said he was willing to accept the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. Hamas claimed that it had not been consulted over the ceasefire conditions and rejected it. &quot;At a time when \u2026 Israel and the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] are in the midst of a military campaign against the terrorist organisations and taking determined action to maintain the security of Israel&apos;s citizens, it cannot be that the deputy defence minister will sharply attack the leadership of the country regarding the campaign,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. &quot;These sharp remarks on the deputy defence minister&apos;s part are irresponsible, especially given his position. They also serve the Hamas terrorist organisation as a tool to attack the government with.&quot; The divisions within the Israeli cabinet have been mocked by Hamas, with spokesman Fauzi Barhoum calling the sacking of Danon a &quot;victory for the resistance&quot;. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel&apos;s hawkish foreign minister, split his Yisrael Beiteinu party from Likud \u2013 dismantling a crucial alliance for Netanyahu \u2013 having accused the prime minister of hesitation over Gaza. Lieberman criticised the government for accepting the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire and called for an IDF ground assault and occupation of the Gaza Strip, arguing that a ceasefire would allow Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups to replenish their stock of weapons. &quot;All this hesitation works against us. We must go all the way, there is no alternative. We have to end this conflict with the IDF in control of all of Gaza \u2026 There is no other way to tackle the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terror that rules Gaza,&quot; Lieberman said at a press conference on Tuesday night. Netanyahu&apos;s election last year was only possible at the head of a shaky coalition of rightwing parties, cracks in which appear to be emerging over the war in Gaza. Danon and Lieberman are not Netanyahu&apos;s only critics. Israeli media reported that another senior figure on the Israeli right, Naftali Bennett, who leads the Jewish Home party, also voted against a ceasefire. Haaretz has reported both Lieberman and Bennett as claiming the government had not informed them about the ceasefire, and that they had heard about the proposed deal via the media. Analysts have said the spats between Netanyahu and his rightwing cabinet colleages should be seen within the broader framework of Israel&apos;s shaky coalition dynamics. Michael Stephens, the deputy director of Qatar-based thinktank Rusi, said that the divisions were extremely damaging to the Israeli government. &quot;[The Lieberman] brand of rightwing populism is actually hurting Bibi more than he initially thought. Lieberman was always a threat but the thinking was Likud-Beitenu would contain him. Now it&apos;s more clear that the right in general is fractured, and particularly at odds with the security establishment.&quot; Hugh Lovatt, the Israel/Palestine project coordinator at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the split could &quot;help to balance out the ruling coalition and glue it around Netanyahu&quot; as more extreme voices gave way to centrist elements of the government, such as justice minister Tzipi Livni, who have called for greater restraint on Israel&apos;s part and a greater willingness to secure a ceasefire with Hamas. &quot;As far as Danny Danon is concerned, he is increasingly seen as a potential rival to Netanyahu within his own party and has been gaining increasing popularity. Netanyahu&apos;s [sacking of him] may backfire. Now that Danon is out of the cabinet he will have even more freedom to criticise him,&quot; Lovatt said. Four rockets were shot down over Tel Aviv at around 9am on Wednesday morning, with reports of shrapnel falling in the north of the city. Israel also suffered its first casualty on Tuesday, when a civilian was killed by a mortar shell outside the Erez crossing into Gaza.

The cafes dotted at each intersection are packed with young people. The street is bustling with joggers and dog-walkers. The contrast with the other side of Israel&apos;s war \u2013 destroyed buildings and grieving families in Gaza \u2013 is striking. But Kalfen, who served in the Israeli Defence Forces for three years during the second intifada and saw 13 of friends killed, harbours no illusions about the reality of war in Gaza, where he served as a young soldier. &quot;I know how it feels to be inside a tank in some of those places,&quot; he recalls. Tel Aviv is not always this peaceful. Last week shrapnel fell a couple of blocks from where Kalfen, a graphic designer, now sits with his friend. A barrage of rockets from Gaza was intercepted over the city only this morning, the shrapnel of one crashing through the roof of a home in a poor district in south Tel Aviv. On Tuesday, 37-year-old Dror Chanin became the first Israeli casualty of the conflict. Chanin, a volunteer who was delivering food to Israeli soldiers near the border with Gaza, was killed by a fragment of mortar fire from Gaza near the Erez border crossing. &quot;Everyone has something to say about what we are doing wrong. But they are not hearing the sirens, running to the shelters or looking after their kids when they wake up shouting in the night,&quot; Kalfen says. His friend Woltsovich stresses that it is only because of Israel&apos;s US-funded multibillion-dollar Iron Dome missile defence system that Tel Avivis are able to continue their lives largely unmolested by rockets from Gaza. According to the Israeli military, Palestinian militants have fired 1,248 rockets at Israel since 8 July \u2013 approximately 145 a day. It was not so long ago, during the first intifada, that terrorist attacks were common here and in most other Israeli cities. &quot;My girlfriend&apos;s uncle was killed in a terrorist attack in Haifa in 2001. The whole family was in shock \u2013 they still are,&quot; Woltsovich says. Both men shrug when asked about the attempts to secure a ceasefire this week \u2013 a deal that has been rejected by Hamas. Woltsovich says he appreciates Binyamin Netanyahu&apos;s restraint from launching a ground invasion, even though as a leftwinger he is generally a critic of the Israeli prime minister. Kalfen is more negative: &quot;I give up. I don&apos;t read the newspapers any more, I don&apos;t care about any of it.&quot; There has been little polling of Israeli opinion since the conflict in Gaza began 10 days ago. Alon Lee-Green, 26, a bookshop owner and peace activist, says that generally in wartime the Israeli left struggles to make its point heard. He has attended multiple protests in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem in recent days, but says numbers are far lower than during the 2012 war in Gaza. &quot;The problem is that on the one hand we are not allowed by the army to gather more than 500 people together when there are missiles and sirens, but on the other we also feel a bit lost over [whether] we call a big crowd of people together while there is a danger of an alarm,&quot; he says. Lee-Green does not consider the rockets themselves to be a danger to protesters, but acknowledges a risk of panic if a siren should sound when a rally is taking place. A peace protest on Saturday night in Tel Aviv was eventually called off, with only a handful of protesters turning out. That protest achieved some notoriety in Israel after it was attacked by a gang of rightwingers who beat a number of young peace activists after police left the demonstration to find shelter when a siren sounded. In Jerusalem, too, peace campaigners have been attacked by gangs of rightwing counter-protesters. On the beachfront near Tel Aviv&apos;s Allenby Street, a 67-year-old ex-soldier sitting drinking Corona says Israel is ready to make peace but does not have a partner in the Palestinians. Until it does, says the man, who declines to give his name, the war is likely to continue. &quot;The problem with these groups \u2013 Hamas, Hezbollah \u2013 is that they say they want peace but what they really want is to push us into the sea,&quot; he says. &quot;You give them Gaza and tomorrow they will be asking for Jaffa.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T15:55:29Z", "title": "In bustling Tel Aviv, Israelis feel strain of war", "sentences": ["Sitting in the shade in the leafy park that takes up most of Tel Aviv&apos;s Sderot Ben Gurion, Nir Kalfen and Gilad Woltsovich, both 32, epitomise most of what the world thinks about the impact of 10 days of war on the bulk of Israeli cities.", "Tel Aviv is not always this peaceful.", "A barrage of rockets from Gaza was intercepted over the city only this morning, the shrapnel of one crashing through the roof of a home in a poor district in south Tel Aviv.", "His friend Woltsovich stresses that it is only because of Israel&apos;s US-funded multibillion-dollar Iron Dome missile defence system that Tel Avivis are able to continue their lives largely unmolested by rockets from Gaza.", "He has attended multiple protests in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem in recent days, but says numbers are far lower than during the 2012 war in Gaza.", "A peace protest on Saturday night in Tel Aviv was eventually called off, with only a handful of protesters turning out.", "On the beachfront near Tel Aviv&apos;s Allenby Street, a 67-year-old ex-soldier sitting drinking Corona says Israel is ready to make peace but does not have a partner in the Palestinians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/rocket-sirens-tel-aviv-israeli-left"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Hamas", "Hezbollah", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has warned that Hamas &quot;shut the door to a diplomatic solution&quot; to the crisis in Gaza as his government was set to authorise the call-up of another 8,000 reserve soldiers in the escalating conflict. Israel, however, did agree to a UN request to halt its bombardment for five hours on humanitarian grounds after its naval strikes killed four children on a beach. Hamas reportedly also agreed. After Hamas formally rejected the ceasefire proposal tabled by Egypt on Monday, Netanyahu said the Islamic organisation bore &quot;sole responsibility for the continuation of the violence&quot;. He accused it of war crimes, in targeting Israeli citizens and using Palestinian civilians as human shields. His comments on Wednesday came after another day of bloodshed in Gaza, where the death toll passed 200. An Israeli civilian was also killed on Tuesday. Israel said more than 1,200 rockets had been launched from Gaza since the start of the nine-day conflict and its forces had carried out more than 1,825 air strikes. The extra reservists will join thousands of others who are on standby in the event of a ground invasion by the Israeli military into Gaza. Although Israel has warned that the deployment of troops and tanks is a real possibility, Netanyahu will have to calculate the potential gains against the increased risk of soldiers being killed and Israel being drawn into a long term reoccupation of Gaza. Hamas&apos;s rejection came as reports emerged of a &quot;secret&quot; weekend telephone call between Netanyahu and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, to discuss a possible ceasefire. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Tony Blair brokered the contact, which resulted in the Egyptian proposal to an immediate &quot;de-escalation&quot;, followed by a ceasefire and then talks on a long-term agreement. Blair was thought to be in continued contact with both leaders. Palestinian leaders in Gaza are enraged at their exclusion and deeply suspicious of Blair&apos;s involvement. They believe the Middle East envoy has a record of acting in Israel&apos;s interests, and they resent his support for Sisi, who has outlawed Hamas&apos;s allies Muslim Brotherhood and hardened attitudes towards Gaza. Israel&apos;s six-hour respite in air strikes on Tuesday in response to the ceasefire call as Hamas continued to fire rockets has allowed it to claim some moral high ground, despite the continuing deaths of civilians, including children, and the destruction of homes and infrastructure in Gaza. On Wednesday, US president Barack Obama backed Egypt&apos;s efforts to broker a ceasefire, offering Washington&apos;s full diplomatic support. He said that while he and the world were &quot;heartbroken&quot; by the deaths of civilians in the Gaza Strip, Israel had the &quot;right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorise&quot; its population. &quot;We&apos;re going to continue to encourage diplomatic efforts to restore the ceasefire, and we support Egypt&apos;s continued efforts to bring this about,&quot; he said. &quot;Over the next 24 hours, we&apos;ll continue to stay in close contact with our friends and parties in the region, and w e will use all of our diplomatic resources and relationships to support efforts of closing a deal on a ceasefire.&quot; Netanyahu has been criticised by several of his most senior ministers for his handling of the crisis, forcing him to sack deputy defence minister, Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu&apos;s Likud party, on Tuesday evening.

The number of tunnels is unknown, but Ma Gen Gadi Shamni, a former commander of the IDF&apos;s Gaza division, said the Israeli military assumed there were dozens. He said the existence of tunnels penetrating Israel was a &quot;major threat that we have to address&quot;. On Thursday, Israeli troops foiled an attempted attack by militants from Gaza who emerged from a tunnel close to Kibbutz Sufa, near the border. Thirteen fighters armed with rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and assault rifles were seen by an IDF spotter who called in an air strike, the military said. Lt Col Peter Lerner, an army spokesman, said the interception had &quot;foiled a terror attack that could have had devastating and deadly consequences&quot;. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said the ground invasion was necessary to destroy tunnels. &quot;It is not possible to deal with tunnels only from the air. It needs to be done also from the ground,&quot; he said before a special cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv on Friday.     IDF soldiers inspect a tunnel uncovered in Israel last year. The tunnel is approximately 58ft underground and extends for a mile. Photograph: Demotix/Corbis    Hamas and other Palestinian organisations \u2013 both militant groups and business entrepreneurs \u2013 have developed expertise in digging hundreds of tunnels during the past seven years of blockade on Gaza. The vast majority of tunnels have been dug from Rafah, at the southern end of Gaza, to Egypt, and have been used to smuggle goods, fuel, construction material and people. Militant groups dug tunnels to smuggle weapons. Since the military coup in Egypt a year ago, almost all the tunnels from Rafah have been destroyed. There are far fewer tunnels dug for military attacks on Israel \u2013 although the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured after militants emerged from a tunnel on the other side of the border. Shalit was dragged back to Gaza through the tunnel, and was held for five years before his release in 2011 in a prisoner swap. Last year, the IDF uncovered a tunnel from Gaza to Israel that was 59ft (18 metres) underground, extended for a mile (1.6km) and was constructed using 500 tonnes of concrete and cement. Fresh tunnels have been dug between Gaza and Israel in the past two years, said Kobi Michael, a senior fellow at the Institute of National Strategic Studies and a former head of the Palestinian desk at the ministry of strategic affairs. He added: &quot;Hamas understands that tunnels are a strategic weapon against Israel. They have learned that the actual impact of rockets is less dramatic than they expected, so the other options is tunnels.&quot; Hamas had devoted immense resources to building tunnels, Michael said: &quot;They are very high quality, very deep, very long, well structured, very professional.&quot; Construction of the tunnels \u2013 many of which are connected to an electricity supply, and some to telephone lines \u2013 can take years. The Israeli military has used geothermal imaging and other hi-tech methods to try to locate them. The current Israeli operation to destroy these &quot;terror tunnels&quot; is complex and risky. It involves troops searching on open ground while being given cover from their air and from tanks.     As well as cross-border tunnels, Hamas has also built a series of interlinked underground passages and bunkers within Gaza. Photograph: Demotix/Corbis    According to Shamdi, many of the tunnels have offshoots in different directions, &quot;so it&apos;s very hard to track the exact route&quot;. Even if a tunnel shaft is destroyed, it would be relatively easy for militants to dig another entrance to an offshoot, he said. &quot;This is a great operational challenge. The chances at the end of this operation that we locate 100% of the tunnels is not high.&quot; As well as cross-border tunnels, Hamas has also built a series of interlinked underground passages and bunkers within Gaza, in which its senior leaders are currently protected from bombing. Hugh Lovatt, Israel-Palestine coordinator at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: &quot;Should the IDF advance deeper into Gaza and into heavily populated areas these tunnels will also give Hamas a tactical edge, not only shielding them from air strikes but also allowing Hamas fighters to mount ambushes and harass advancing Israeli soldiers.&quot; Guerilla fighters in the past conflicts had used tunnels &quot;to mount lightening raids against more conventional forces and then melt away before the opposing force can bring its full military might to bear. Examples include Stalingrad, Vietnam and also southern Lebanon in 2006 where the IDF encountered a series of well-prepared Hezbollah defensive positions which caused significant casualties amongst IDF ranks.&quot; Hamas said on Friday that the IDF would pay a high price for its ground invasion. &quot;Gaza will be the graveyard of the occupation soldiers, and these are not slogans,&quot; a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Lebanese television. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are likely to attempt to draw Israeli troops into fighting on the ground in urban areas. The IDF, which had its first military casualty overnight, would be exposed to a much higher risk of death and injury. Israel also risks getting sucked into an undesirable re-occupation of Gaza, nine years after withdrawing troops and settlers from the territory. Indications are that Netanyahu and his close colleagues are anxious to restrict the ground operation to the goal of clearing and securing land close to the border rather retaking control of the entire enclave. Michael said that &quot;mission creep&quot; was possible in the current operation. &quot;As far as I understand, the end objective of the military is limited, but it might not end only with tunnels.&quot; The extension of the buffer zone was &quot;not only a question of the number of metres from the fence, it&apos;s also about the nature of control&quot;. Israel might demand that the zone be policed by Palestinian Authority or even Egyptian forces, he said. &quot;And Israel will want the ability to act there if necessary. The circumstances of Palestinian civilians who live and work near the fence will be much less convenient.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-18T12:03:09Z", "title": "Israel targets 'terror tunnels' in Gaza ground invasion", "sentences": ["It needs to be done also from the ground,&quot; he said before a special cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv on Friday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/israel-targets-tunnels-gaza-ground-invasion"}, {"tags": ["Ukraine", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Europe", "US news", "Russia", "World news"], "article": "President Barack Obama, in his televised address on Friday, called for a careful investigation into the downing of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 plane over eastern Ukraine. He left little doubt, however, as to whom he and the US government considered responsible. The Malaysian plane was hit by an air defence missile, he said, fired from the territory held by rebels backed and armed by Russia. Russian president Vladimir Putin, addressing senior government officials last Thursday, put the responsibility for the loss of almost 300 innocent lives on the government of Ukraine. Had there been peace in Ukraine, or at least, had there been no resumption of fighting recently in the Donbass region, this tragedy would have never occurred. Putin&apos;s general comment, however, was not accompanied by any specific accusation. Instead both Putin and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, insisted on a thorough international investigation. It appears likely at this point that the Malaysian plane was shot down by a missile fired by the system known in Nato as SA-11 and designated &quot;Buk&quot; in the Soviet Union, which developed and produced it. These medium-range air defence systems are now owned by both Russia and Ukraine. The separatist &quot;Donetsk People&apos;s Republic&quot; denies that it has any, but both Ukrainian and US officials believe such systems have been transferred to it from Russia. The Russian defence ministry, for its part, points the finger at the Ukrainian armed forces, saying that they have deployed Buk systems in the parts of Donbass which Kiev controls. While Ukrainian and western experts note that the separatists have recently downed several Ukrainian military aircraft, including transport planes, and suggest that they may have mistaken the Malaysian Boeing for a Ukrainian IL-76, Russian experts point to Ukraine possibly preparing to shoot down Russian aircraft in case of a war between the two countries, and &quot;pushing the wrong button&quot; while practising. Indeed, many in Kiev a week ago believed that 15 or 16 July would be the date of a large-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Each side bases its theories on historical analogies. For many in the west old enough to remember the cold war, the nearest parallel is to the downing of the Korean Air Lines Flight KAL007 by a Russian fighter jet off Sakhalin in 1983. For many in Russia, a more pertinent case is the shooting of the Siberia Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk in 2001 by a Ukrainian S-200 missile fired during an exercise in Crimea. There is also a mutual history of denial. It took the Soviet Union several days to admit to having shot down a passenger jet \u2013 which the Soviet military took for a US military reconnaissance plane. The Ukrainians, despite a very different environment, balked at admitting their responsibility, despite the massive evidence, pointing out that the missile itself was never found. The former Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, in remarks played again and again on Russian television during the past few days, also sought to minimise the importance of what had occurred, saying something along the lines of: &quot;Stuff happens.&quot; Because so many people from several countries aboard MH17 were senselessly killed, an international investigation is an absolute priority. Russia insists on it, it says \u2013 both as a means to calm down anti-Russian emotions, which are running very high, and as a means to establish all the relevant facts. One may infer from Putin&apos;s words that the context is as important, if not more, than the actual firing of the missile. The investigation will not prove easy for a number of reasons, including the failure to close off the area immediately after the crash and the overall security and political situation in the Donetsk region. However, it should not be limited to the site of the crash and should examine data reflecting the activities of relevant military groups in both Ukraine and Russia. The MH17 tragedy raises the wider issue of responsibility in armed conflicts. If, indeed, the missile that downed the Malaysian airliner has been fired by the rebels supported by Russia, Moscow will not escape its share of the blame. It has been giving various kinds of support \u2013 political, moral, and material \u2013 to militants fighting the elected authority in Kiev. It has also been in constant contact with the leaders of the self-proclaimed republics. If it becomes established that it provided them with the Buk system which downed the passenger plane, the self-inflicted blow to Russia&apos;s international position in the west and Asia will be enormous. Moscow would have to accept full responsibility for placing powerful weaponry in the hands of a non-state actor, and exercising no control over its use. The context which Putin focuses upon is no less important, however. The west fully supports a Ukrainian government which originated from a revolution that toppled an elected \u2013 if obviously corrupt \u2013 president. True, the new president, Petro Poroshenko, has a solid popular mandate. Yet the referendums held in Donetsk and Luhansk two weeks prior to the presidential poll \u2013 and no less illegal than the Maidan revolution in Kiev \u2013 reflected a very high degree of dissatisfaction in eastern Ukraine with the deal they were getting from central government. The legitimacy of the &quot;people&apos;s republics&quot; is questionable, of course, but the Ukrainian government&apos;s &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot;, resulting in an ever-rising toll of civilian lives, does not do much to endear Kiev to the easterners. The west&apos;s tendency to treat one&apos;s allies more leniently than one&apos;s adversaries \u2013 while sticking to the same high principles throughout \u2013 can and does backfire. In Ukraine, a lot is at stake today. First, for the Ukrainians themselves, wherever they may live. The fate of their country remains in the balance \u2013 not just because of the armed conflict in the east, but as a result of the dire economic situation and an uncertain political future. Russia, too, is profoundly affected. Having clashed with the United States over Ukraine, it is now facing increasingly serious consequences in a number of areas \u2013 above all, in economy and finance. For Europe, Ukraine represents a security risk far higher than the one it faced in the Balkans in the 1990s. In the US, Russia may have come to be seen as a nasty nuisance rather than a worthy competitor or a real threat. Yet there is an impression that the punishment already administered is not supported by a realistic strategy leading to a credible goal. If so, it could lead to a very different outcome from the one that the US might desire. Outwardly, Presidents Obama and Putin are united in the need for an independent inquiry and for an immediate ceasefire by all sides in Ukraine. This should be the basis for an approach that could possibly reverse the trend toward mutual destruction within Ukraine and beyond. The verdict of the investigation should not be pre-judged, and, once pronounced, should be accepted. A ceasefire, monitored by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, needs to be followed up by an inclusive political process aimed at establishing a proper place and role for all Ukrainian regions in a united Ukrainian state. The Contact Group, a forum which includes Europeans and Russians, should help steer that process. If there is political progress, the EU and Russia should start a dialogue on their economic relations with Ukraine, and possible assistance for it. Joint and shared responsibility should be the guiding principle. There is an alternative, of course. It is so obvious \u2013 and so obviously horrific \u2013 that it hardly needs to be spelled out.

Watching the missiles and explosions light up the sky was, Magnay declared on-air, \u201can astonishing, macabre and awful thing\u201d, but these locals had a different slant. \u201cIsraelis on hill above Sderot cheer as bombs land on #gaza;\u201d she tweeted after the broadcast ended, \u201cthreaten to \u2018destroy our car if I say a word wrong\u2019. Scum.\u201d Twenty minutes later, the tweet had been deleted, and CNN later reassigned its reporter to Moscow \u2013 actions which, in the social media age, guarantee a story goes viral. A few days earlier, photographs emerged of young residents relaxing on folding chairs as they watched the bombing. Some smoked water pipes; others had brought popcorn. On one level, the \u201cSderot cinema\u201d sums up the asymmetry of this so-called conflict: of Gazans huddled in terror as a military superpower pounds their overcrowded, besieged open-air prison camp; while on the other side of the border, Israelis joyously celebrate their country\u2019s military might, whatever fear they have of Hamas rockets eclipsed by the thrill of bombs detonating in the near distance. It is also illustrative of how occupations corrupt the occupier. \u201cWhat a misfortune it is for one nation to subjugate another,\u201d Friedrich Engels wrote in 1864, referring to Britain\u2019s oppression of Ireland. \u201cAll English abominations have their origin in the Irish pale.\u201d And so it goes with Israel and Gaza. An important caveat is, of course, that most Israelis would not dream of treating a military offensive that inevitably spills blood as though it was a perverse video game. This is an extreme example of what occupations do to the occupier. To regard the lives of those your country is subjugating as being equal to your own would make even one death intolerable. If you think their children are much like your own, you would be unlikely to believe any military operation that kills dozens had a justification; you would demand an alternative strategy, however difficult it might at first appear. It is believed that sociopaths make up just 1% of any given population; the rest of us have an enormous potential capacity for empathy. But empathy relies on a sense of shared humanity; once that is obliterated, it is possible to tolerate almost limitless suffering. That is why occupations have to \u201cother\u201d the occupied \u2013 because otherwise subjugation becomes impossible. It is a process that is far from unique to Israel. The same phenomenon is evident throughout Britain\u2019s colonial history: from Ireland, and the dehumanisation of its inhabitants, to events more recent than many of us would like to admit. In 2012 AT Williams published A Very British Killing, about the death of an Iraqi hotel receptionist at the hands of occupying British troops in 2003. Along with nine other civilians, a sandbag was placed over his head, he was bound with plastic handcuffs and subjected to humiliation and casual violence until he was beaten to death. In January, a 250-page dossier documenting allegations by Iraqis of torture, mock executions and sexual assault at the hands of British troops was submitted to the international criminal court. Such behaviour is all but inherent in any occupation. There is a crucial difference with Israel, and it is too often downplayed or poorly understood by supporters of Palestinian justice. The moral corruption that comes with any occupation has fused with the collective trauma of the Jewish people. Angela Godfrey-Goldstein is a peace activist in Jerusalem: she tells me that Israel\u2019s mentality \u201cis very easy to understand in a way where people were traumatised over centuries. It bred a sense that people owe us, of \u2018who are you to tell us what to do?\u2019.\u201d A fellow human rights activist in Tel Aviv agrees. \u201cIn Israeli society there is a victim mentality that is deeply, deeply rooted in the Holocaust and encouraged by those in power, even though at the moment we\u2019re not victims, we\u2019re an incredibly powerful country with an incredibly powerful military.\u201d The Jewish people faced persecution for millenniums: the 1190 massacre of the Jews at York, the pogroms of tsarist Russia, the Dreyfus affair of France. It culminated in a systematic, industrialised attempt at extermination in the Holocaust. There are Jewish people alive who remember SS guards screeching at them; some still have death camp numbers tattooed on their skin. \u201cWhat has changed since the Holocaust is our ability to defend ourselves by ourselves,\u201d declares Binyamin Netanyahu, and you can see why it resonates. The all too recent memory of the gas chambers encourages the sense that Israel can never be too strong, and that its people can never be oppressors. When Palestinians die, says Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem spokeswoman Sarit Michaeli, \u201cIsraelis don\u2019t deny [they] have died, but they\u2019ve simply done a mental process that blames the Palestinian deaths on Palestinians themselves.\u201d Gaza residents are homogenised as Hamas supporters \u2013 even though most were not of voting age when the group was elected in 2006 \u2013 justifying collective punishment. For those who want peace \u2013 including an end to the occupation and the dismantling of every settlement \u2013 it is tempting to demonise Israeli supporters of this latest offensive. But it is futile and self-defeating. The occupation will not end until the rationales that sustain it are understood. As Palestinian children are killed, that may seem like a lot to stomach, but it is no less necessary. Twitter: @OwenJones84 \u2022 This article was amended on 21 July 2014.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they were investigating Hamas&apos;s kidnap claim. Speaking on a Hamas television station, a masked spokesman, Abu Ubaida, said: &quot;We have captured a Zionist soldier and the occupation has not admitted that.&quot; The claim came after a seven-hour battle between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters in the neighbourhood of Shujai&apos;iya, the first of further confrontations in the coming days, according to a senior Israeli military source. IDF soldiers encountered a sophisticated, disciplined, brave, highly trained and well-equipped army of militants, he said. &quot;We have to admit we were facing good fighters, very well equipped with sophisticated weapons systems, accurate weapons, heavy weapons including mortars, booby traps. &quot;It was very difficult fighting,&quot; the Israeli source said. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult for us to surprise them. They were simply waiting for us.&quot; Most of the Hamas fighters had been trained in Iran, he said. &quot;We can trace the methods,&quot; he said, referring to the tactics of embedding into densely populated areas for protection. &quot;We&apos;ve seen the same with Hezbollah [in Lebanon].&quot; But, he added: &quot;We&apos;ve learned lessons, and we&apos;ll do better tonight and in the coming nights.&quot; Israeli troops were still on the ground in Shujai&apos;iya, although in control was &quot;not the exact term&quot;. The official, speaking at the IDF&apos;s headquarters in Tel Aviv, warned that similar battles were to be expected in the coming days in pursuit of its goal of locating and destroying tunnels used by militants to launch attacks against Israel. Many tunnel entrances had been found in Shujai&apos;iya, which he described as a &quot;stronghold of Hamas&quot;, in the course of Sunday&apos;s battle. The IDF has discovered about 15 tunnels since the start of the ground operation but there were many more than initially expected, said the official. He described it as a &quot;very sophisticated network within Gaza and into Israel&quot;, with multiple entrances, shafts and offshoots. The IDF had used robots to destroy tunnels as well as conventional methods, he said, adding that the decision to give advance warning to civilians in Gaza of impending operations gave a clear indication to Hamas of Israel&apos;s military intentions. Leaflets and text messages had given the residents of Shujai&apos;iya at least two days&apos; warning to leave their homes by a specific deadline, with instructions about which streets marked a safe area, the source said. &quot;They didn&apos;t leave because of threats from Hamas,&quot; he said. &quot;So many civilian casualties is bad but that&apos;s what Hamas wanted us to face, the civilian human shield.&quot; Although the official said he would like to see a ceasefire, he conceded it would be difficult for Israel now to abandon its stated goal of locating and destroying cross-border tunnels. &quot;It can take days, but I hope it won&apos;t take more than that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have still green light [from the politicians], we have a mission, we are going to fulfil it.

Israel has claimed that Hamas hides weapons in hospitals.           Further south, in Khan Younis, an extended family was wiped out in an air strike on a house. The number of dead was put at between 24 and 28. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said another 10 people were killed in a single air strike in Rafah, including four young children and a baby. Save the Children said that on average, seven had been killed every day during the conflict. &quot;For many children, this is the third war in six years that they are going through,&quot; said the charity&apos;s David Hassell. Israeli troops said they killed 10 Hamas militants as they attempted a cross-border attack using two tunnels. The Israel Defence Forces said seven soldiers had been killed in the 24 hours up to early evening. Intense rocket fire from Gaza continued, with sirens warning people in Tel Aviv and other towns in central and southern Israel to seek shelter.

If the capture of an Israeli is confirmed, it will complicate efforts to broker a ceasefire. &quot;We advise [Israel] to take their soldiers and leave before we kidnap more soldiers in addition to the scores we have already killed and wounded,&quot; said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.

The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, was due to meet Hamas&apos;s leader-in-exile, Khaled Mishal, in Doha. Egypt&apos;s proximity to Gaza, its peace treaty with Israel and good relations with the western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank have made it the focus of attempts to defuse the crisis, though its relations with Hamas \u2013 which it sees as an offshoot of the banned Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 are hostile. Hamas rejected Cairo&apos;s original ceasefire proposal last week, though a senior official said Egypt might be willing to amend its initiative. &quot;Egypt does not mind adding some of Hamas&apos;s conditions provided that all involved parties approve,&quot; the official told Reuters.

As his coffin, draped in an Israeli flag was lowered from a military jeep, wails and sobs erupted from members of the Ethiopian Jewish community, of which Malko was a member. The coffin was accompanied to a grave by a phalanx of uniformed young soldiers, many in tears. Community elders, dressed in white shawls and turbans, stood close by. Tomer Siyonov, 22, a friend of the dead soldier, who finished his own compulsory army service two months ago, drew deeply on a cigarette as the eulogies were delivered. &quot;Hamas killed my friend; we need to kill them \u2013 not just the Hamas militants but all the people in Gaza,&quot; he said. &quot;What else should we do? Lose more friends? We don&apos;t have a choice \u2013 if we don&apos;t fight to the end, they will kill us.&quot; A young woman, one of three crying throughout the funeral, had been to school with Malko. Asked about what should now happen in Gaza, she was guarded. &quot;It&apos;s complicated,&quot; was all she said before turning to comfort her friends. Elsewhere in Jerusalem, support for the military offensive appeared to be hardening despite the rising casualties on both sides. &quot;All of our people are united,&quot; said Gal Tuttnauer, 25, eating shawarma in the city centre. &quot;Of course I&apos;m against a ceasefire, we need to continue. Hamas needs to be wiped out, and that will take time.&quot; The international media, he said, was duped into showing images of dead children in Gaza without explaining the context to the conflict. &quot;Why isn&apos;t the foreign media talking about what&apos;s happening in Syria? Israel is seen as the black sheep. No one cares about Israel, because Hamas and the Palestinians are the underdogs, and everyone likes an underdog. They have rockets and we have a big army, so we&apos;re the always the bad guys.&quot; Asher Dobol, 57, whose son is currently fighting in Gaza, said: &quot;Of course I&apos;m worried about him, but \u2013 this time \u2013 everyone thinks the government must not stop until they&apos;ve destroyed all the tunnels. It was right to go in [on the ground]. We must destroy Hamas and take over Gaza.&quot; In contrast to previous conflicts, he added, &quot;this time the world is supporting Israel. The world understands we cannot live under rocket fire.&quot; Both men said they regretted Palestinian civilian casualties, but blamed Hamas rather than the Israeli army. &quot;A lot of people were killed in Shujai&apos;iya because Hamas uses them as human shields,&quot; said Tuttnauer, adding: &quot;Palestinians don&apos;t care about human life, whereas we appreciate life. We want to live, they want to die.&quot; Support for the military operation is strong, but not universal, among Israelis. Demonstrations and rallies calling for peace have attracted small numbers, but one in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening mustered about 1,000 people. Like previous peace protests, it was attacked by rightwing activists, who threw eggs and plastic bottles. In Haifa, a mixed city, an anti-war protest on the same day was confronted with rightwingers, chanting: &quot;Death to Arabs&quot;. The city&apos;s Israeli-Arab deputy mayor and his son were beaten up. Following Sunday&apos;s bloodshed in Shujai&apos;iya, Israeli-Arabs called for a day of mourning and a general strike, which was largely observed in Arab towns in the north of the country. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel&apos;s hawkish foreign minister, called on Israeli Jews to boycott Arab businesses in response. The peace camp, once a vocal part of Israeli political discourse, has struggled in recent years as the centre of political gravity has shifted to the right and successive attempts to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians have failed. Attempts by the right to pass laws which limit the capacity of pro-peace organisations and campaigners to operate effectively have also sapped the confidence of and support for the Israeli left. Haggai Matar, 30, an Israeli journalist and political activist, said the actions and statements of many Israeli politicians fuelled the far right. &quot;We have seen politicians passing bills against human rights NGOs\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 and very high-ranking politicians saying that the NGOs and leftists are a cancer and are traitors and trying to destroy our society \u2013 these are not words of regular democratic or political conflict,&quot; he said, adding that young people in Israel were now often more rightwing than their parents. &quot;Our parents would remember having gone to Palestinian cities for shopping or seen more Palestinian workers coming into Israel. It was never an equal relationship but it was a chance to meet, and that you haven&apos;t had for 20 years or more,&quot; he said. Rhoel Chaguel and her daughter, Ron, epitomise that generational change in attitudes among many Israelis towards their Palestinian neighbours. Rhoel, a mother of three whose family were Arabic-speaking Jews from Morocco, had spent time in hospital recently with her son, Simon, and met families from Gaza who were being treated there. Rhoel conversed with the mothers, and often brought them clothes and food. &quot;They are afraid of Hamas,&quot; she said. Ron, 17, and just six months away from beginning her national service, which she plans to spend working in a hospital rather than serve in the military, disagreed. &quot;When they are healthy they will go back to Gaza, these boys,&quot; she said. &quot;They will grow up and become terrorists.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-21T15:33:21Z", "title": "Gaza crisis: 'Hamas killed my friend; we need to kill them'", "sentences": ["Demonstrations and rallies calling for peace have attracted small numbers, but one in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening mustered about 1,000 people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/gaza-crisis-hamas-killed-friend-need-kill"}, {"tags": ["Boxing", "Sport"], "article": "The hair doesn\u2019t quite have the lustre or ping of old, but Don King, at 82, has a few electric shocks left for his obituary writers. The latest of them is among his most outrageous: his announcement here on Tuesday that he hopes to bring the new WBC heavyweight champion, Bermane \u201cB Ware\u201d Stiverne, to Egypt in November to make his first defence against the most feared puncher in boxing, Deontay Wilder. The American promoter said: \u201cI want to hold it in the shadows of the Pyramids and it\u2019s going to be called King of the Nile.\u201d Forty years after King put together the Rumble in the Jungle, this would complete a unique hat-trick of global presentations, each with its own catchy label, to go with the Rumble and the Thrilla in Manila of 1975. While the first two fights \u2013 with Muhammad Ali starring in both \u2013 were the high points of a glittering and some times controversial career, King has survived all subsequent attempts to bury him, from mob threats to serial vilification in the media. Two months ago in Los Angeles, Stiverne, a 35-year-old Haitian who rebuilt a troubled life in Canada and has lived in Las Vegas for 10 years chasing unlikely ring glory, threw his promoter a lifeline when he stopped Chris Arreola in the sixth round to win the WBC title vacated by Vitali Klitschko, whose battlefield is now the more complicated political landscape of Ukraine. That win, secured with two impressive knockdowns (one of which injured his hand, forcing an extended lay-off), catapulted King back into the big picture after nearly a decade on the fringes. A year ago, one critic observed: \u201cIt is truly clear that Don King is finished. Only the caricature bordering on self-parody remains.\u201d Maybe so, but the caricature has been in buoyant mood since arriving here on Saturday, defying recommendations by US State Department officials concerned for the safety of Americans in the volatile environment of worsening regional conflict. At least six American and European airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv after a rocket attack near Ben Gurion Airport, as well as the mounting death toll in Gaza. King, nevertheless, flew into Cairo, waving flags of all persuasions and had quick talks with the American ambassador. On Tuesday he charmed local media with his megaphone message as the Peace Fighter. Moments before he taped an interview with the celebrated local TV presenter Youssef Hosseiny, King took a call from the US secretary of state, John Kerry, who advised him he might be late for his press conference that night as he was down for talks with Egypt\u2019s new president, Abdul Fattah el-Sisi. King will also talk with Sisi \u2013 after his Egyptian hosts show him the Pyramids, Luxor and the Valley of the Kings \u2013 hoping to persuade him to bankroll his fight to restore confidence in the country\u2019s battered tourism industry. Tourist traffic is down 20% in the 12 months to June, because of rumbling civil unrest, as well as the imprisonment for seven years of three al-Jazeera journalists accused of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood to \u201cbroadcast bad news\u201d. King said he would do his best to intervene on behalf of the journalists \u2013 not a species of whom he has always been fond. Drawing on all his oratorial gifts, he praised Sisi in a long, hilarious interview with Hosseiny, due to be aired on Wednesday. At one point, King had to interrupt the interview to turn off his three mobile phones, all of which were ringing. Earlier King rehearsed a poem he had written for the president: \u201cEgypt, Egypt hear my cry, V-I-C-T-O-R-Y, Victory for peace is our quest, To lead us to that goal at the people\u2019s request, El Fattah el-Sisi is the best, Yay Sisi, may the blessings of Allah, Guide you in this mission.\u201d If the scansion was reminiscent of Ali, it hit the spot with a local audience new to King\u2019s theatrical style. Wilder is Stirvane\u2019s mandatory challenger, and by some way his toughest assignment. The tall American, who won bronze at the Beijing Olympics, has levelled all of his 31 professional opponents, among them Britain\u2019s ever-disappointing Audley Harrison, who fell inside a round (and who recently rang King to see if he could facilitate another comeback, at 42). King has one more surprise for the doubters, providing Stiverne beats Wilder. \u201cI want him to fight Mike Tyson,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorge Foreman came back at 47, and Mike can too.\u201d It is no more improbable than anything else he has pulled off in four decades of unrivalled chutzpah.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-22T18:49:50Z", "title": "Don King reveals plans for Bermane Stiverne to fight \u2018King of the Nile\u2019", "sentences": ["At least six American and European airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv after a rocket attack near Ben Gurion Airport, as well as the mounting death toll in Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/22/don-king-bermane-stiverne-king-of-the-nile"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "It is a sad reflection on the parlous state of the domestic opposition that a spokesman for the Israeli Labor party can conceive of criticism of overwhelming force in self-defence only as a demand for more dead Israelis (A thirst for Israeli blood, 21 July). By Hilik Bar&apos;s logic, there is no limit to the number of Palestinian women and children who may have to die or suffer horrible injuries in pursuit of an objective that is unachievable by military means. The thought that proportionality might involve a reduction in Palestinian fatalities never occurs to him. In addition to this shocking lack of empathy, his blinkered &quot;context&quot; only reaches as far as the current round of rocket attacks, while completely ignoring the consequences of a 47-year occupation. Now that Ed Miliband has joined those publicly critical of the land invasion of Gaza, which has added greatly to the toll of death and destruction, Hilik Bar would do well to recognise that patience with an untenable status quo, even of erstwhile sympathisers, is beginning to run out.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon \u2022\u2008The shooting down of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine (Report, 22 July) appeared for a while to have distracted world attention from the potentially greater tragedy unfolding in Gaza. There is a connection between the two events. Hamas is firing rockets indiscriminately at Israel&apos;s population centres, including its international airport. If just one of those missiles were to strike an aircraft, innocent passengers from all over the world, not just Israelis, would become victims of Hamas&apos;s lethal war against Israel. The international community has a responsibility to help Israel and other governments put a stop to the criminally irresponsible firing of missiles at\u00a0inadmissible targets \u2013 including civil air space whether over Donetsk or Tel Aviv.David StoneEmeritus professor, University of Glasgow \u2022\u2008It is, to say the least, ironic that Hilik Bar imagines how the UK would react to rockets rained down by terrorists from the Isle of Man. He seems to have forgotten that a violent conflict lasting about 30 years raged in Northern Ireland with considerable extraterritorial assistance from within the territories of the Republic of Ireland and the United States. Mercifully, whatever mistakes and wrongs committed by the British government, there was nothing like the wanton overreaction to which the Israeli government has frequently resorted. The Republic of Ireland was not subject to air raids or temporary occupation. By contrast, this summer the murder of three young Israeli men has resulted in all-out war after the Israeli government resorted to brutal reprisals rather than restricting themselves to the routes of calm criminal investigation or international diplomacy. The point about proportionality is not that there should be matching death rates but rather that disproportionate escalation to extreme violence is self-defeating and will simply generate further similar violence in the future.Felix ThompsonDuffield, Derbyshire \u2022\u2008If the British had bombed and mortared houses in Catholic districts of Northern Ireland to kill hundreds of innocent supporters of Sinn F\u00e9in and their children, and tried to justify it on the basis that it was trying to stop IRA terrorism, there would have been a world outcry, not least from the US. But because Arabs have no constituency in the west, and people who criticise Israel are deemed to be antisemites, all we get is mealy-mouthed &quot;on the one hand, on the other hand&quot; editorial hand-wringing, even from the Guardian, whose writers are surely more aware of the iniquities of Israel&apos;s treatment of the Palestinians than more rightwing papers. It is time for the world to unite against Israel, a rogue state whose actions in the Middle East over the past seven decades have caused suffering and injustice over a longer period than any other so-called democratic state.Karl SabbaghAuthor, Palestine: A Personal History \u2022\u2008While writing of the critics of Israel&apos;s disproportionate response to the Hamas rockets, Hilik Bar could have instanced an example very close to home. In our struggle against Nazi Germany, the Germans bombed and damaged some of our major cities. We responded by totally devastating almost every one of theirs, causing hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties. This massive disproportionate response was supported overwhelmingly and enthusiastically by the British public. The only way to ensure there is no disproportionate response is not to attack in the first place.Paul MillerLondon  \u2022\u2008Hilik Bar, the subtext is not about proportionality of deaths but about the question of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and its consequences. Israelis do not have to die to gain sympathy. They simply have to question why the Palestinians&apos; democratically elected representatives are waging a concerted and murderous attack on the entire Israeli population, when they fire their rockets from a tiny patch of Palestinian land in Israel. Of course Israel has the right to defend itself; other countries deal with terrorism in more measured ways; Spain and Eta, the UK and the IRA. Neither country bombed the organisations because they were asking for change. Israel needs to believe that their rights for existence will always be asserted by the UN, America and its allies. The Palestinians are merely asserting their rights before they are ground out of existence in their own country.Anna TognarelliMarple, Greater Manchester \u2022\u2008In 1948, aged 12 in Pretoria, I joined Habonim, a Zionist youth organisation modelled on the scouts. A year or so later, a Zionist speaker came to address us. He told us that the Zionist aim was a Jewish home covering the whole of Palestine and South Lebanon up to the Litani river and also Mount Hermon. &quot;What about the people living there now?&quot; I asked. They would leave, he replied, just as the Arabs had left Israel. Even the Boers hadn&apos;t gone so far as to expel the Natives from South Africa, I said, and left Habonim. Seen in that light, Israeli policy of invasion and annexation has had a consistent flow, interrupted only by defeat by Hezbollah in South Lebanon. Hilik Bar&apos;s description of a &quot;thirst for Israeli blood&quot; to outsiders looks much more like a thirst for Palestinian blood for the offence of being there at all. Israel could have a ceasefire by agreeing to lift its illegal blockade of Gaza. Do not those who suffer such aggression have a right to resist? Where is the line between resistance and terrorism?Michael Sterne Sarisbury Green, Hampshire \u2022\u2008Your leading article (A futile war, July 22) mentions the benefits of having the PLO back in charge of Gaza rather than Hamas, but it fails to point out that the opposite move is more likely. It was Israeli intransigence when the PLO was in control there earlier that created the formation of Hamas in 1987 as an outcome of Palestinian frustration with what was seen as the &quot;moderation&quot; of the PLO. Similarly today, if Hamas cannot deliver real progress towards a Palestinian state, it is likely to be superseded by even more extreme jihadis, probably associated with Hizbollah as in Lebanon. After all, every civilian death in Gaza is another catalyst for recruitment to the jihadi ranks.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds \u2022 Please allow me to ask a simple question: why has Hamas chosen to spend its energy and resources on building extensive tunnels to attack Israel rather than on bomb shelters for the Gazan population?Russell BarashElstree, Hertfordshire", "publicationDate": "2014-07-22T19:17:16Z", "title": "Lack of empathy with the Palestinians' plight | @guardianletters", "sentences": ["The international community has a responsibility to help Israel and other governments put a stop to the criminally irresponsible firing of missiles at\u00a0inadmissible targets \u2013 including civil air space whether over Donetsk or Tel Aviv.David StoneEmeritus professor, University of Glasgow \u2022\u2008It is, to say the least, ironic that Hilik Bar imagines how the UK would react to rockets rained down by terrorists from the Isle of Man."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/22/lack-of-empathy-with-palestinians-plight"}, {"tags": ["Australia news", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Gaza"], "article": "Good morning folks, and welcome to the Morning Mail \u2013 sign up here to get it straight to your inbox before 8am every weekday.

The move came as political leaders and diplomats held urgent talks in the region with the United Nations chief, Ban Ki-moon, saying his &quot;hope and belief&quot; was that an end to the two-week-old conflict could be &quot;very near&quot;. Kerry is expected to meet Ban, Israel&apos;s prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian Authority&apos;s president, Mahmoud Abbas, during his one-day visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah. He flew in despite a ban by America&apos;s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on all US flights to and from Israel imposed on Tuesday due to security concerns. On Wednesday morning, the Palestinian decision-making body led by Abbas said it was backing Hamas&apos;s demands that an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and other concessions must form part of any deal to end the hostilities. Meanwhile fierce fighting was reported near Khan Younis in the south, which came under Israeli tank shelling and drone strikes. The Palestinian Red Crescent, which has been trying to evacuate about 250 people from the area, told the Associated Press that Hamas fighters in the area were deploying rocket-propelled grenades and light weapons, including machine guns, against the Israelis. Opening an emergency debate in Geneva on Wednesday morning, the UN human rights chief, Navi Pillay, said Israel might be committing war crimes in Gaza, adding that punitive house demolitions and the killing of children raised the &quot;strong possibility&quot; that it was violating international law. She also condemned the indiscriminate firing of rockets and mortars by Hamas into Israel. Israel reported that two more of its soldiers had died in the conflict, bringing the military&apos;s death toll to 29. Two Israeli civilians have also died in the 15 days of fighting. According to the Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra, the Palestinian death toll stood at 650, most of them civilians. Delta was the first carrier to halt flights to and from Israel after diverting a flight carrying 273 passengers bound for Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport to Paris on Tuesday after &quot;reports of a rocket or associated debris near the airport in Tel Aviv&quot;. It was followed by America&apos;s FAA \u2013 which has halted all US flights to and from Israel \u2013 Air France and the Dutch airline KLM. While easyJet also suspended flights, British Airways said it would carry on with its twice-daily service from London. On Tuesday night Netanyahu asked Kerry to help restore commercial flights. A White House official, when asked, said: &quot;We&apos;re not going to overrule the FAA. Period.&quot; Delta Airlines said it had suspended service until further notice to and from Ben Gurion international airport in Tel Aviv and the airline&apos;s New York-JFK hub. It added: &quot;Delta, in co-ordination with the US Federal Aviation Administration, is doing so to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees.&quot; A spokesperson for Air France announced that the airline had suspended all flights owing to the &quot;evolution of the security situation in Israel&quot;. &quot;The decision \u2026 will come into effect immediately and remain until further notice,&quot; he added. The surprise decision is likely to alarm the Israeli government and business community, which have so far seen relatively few economic repercussions from the conflict. It will doubtless deliver a substantial blow to the tourism industry, the one sector that has already suffered during the conflict. High-level diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued in the region, with Ban suggesting in a video link to the UN security council in New York from Ramallah that a breakthrough could be imminent, although he could not disclose details &quot;at this highly sensitive moment&quot;. &quot;Suffice it to say, it is my hope and belief that these talks will lead to results and an end to the fighting in the very near future,&quot; he said, while acknowledging &quot;many obstacles and complexities&quot;. On Wednesday morning the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) endorsed demands by Hamas for halting Gaza hostilities. &quot;The Gaza demands of stopping the aggression and lifting the blockade in all its forms are the demands of the entire Palestinian people and they represent the goal that the Palestinian leadership has dedicated all its power to achieve,&quot; the senior PLO official Yasser Abed Rabbo said in Ramallah. Signalling that Abbas, too, sought a staggered cessation of hostilities, the Palestinian leader&apos;s Fatah faction on Tuesday proposed a truce followed by five days of negotiations on terms. There was no immediate response to the PLO statement from Hamas or Israel. Earlier in Tel Aviv, Ban had delivered a blunt message to Netanyahu, saying the bloodshed in Gaza must end. As the Israeli military continued its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, the secretary general urged Israel to exercise &quot;maximum restraint&quot;. Ban said he understood the state&apos;s security concerns, &quot;but your military response is causing many civilian casualties. I hope we will be able to see the end of this violence as soon as possible.&quot; Representing Israeli frustration at external criticism of its operation in Gaza, Israel&apos;s ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, controversially suggested Israel should be awarded the Nobel peace prize for &quot;fighting with unimaginable restraint&quot;. He told a meeting of Christians United For Israel in Washington: &quot;Some are shamelessly accusing Israel of genocide and would put us in the dock for war crimes. But the truth is that the Israel Defence Forces should be given \u2026 a Nobel peace prize for fighting with unimaginable restraint.&quot; On the 15th day of fighting, the death toll in Gaza topped 600 with more than 3,700 injured. On Monday, the UN said one of its schools being used to shelter thousands of refugees from the fighting had been hit by shelling. The humanitarian agency also announced that more than 100,000 people had sought shelter in its schools, and 43% of the Gaza Strip had become a virtual no-go zone following Israeli warnings for residents to leave ahead of bombardment. Earlier this week an air strike on a house near Khan Younis killed 25 members of one family, including 18 children and five women, three of whom were pregnant, as they broke the Ramadan fast on Sunday evening. A Hamas member was also killed. Israel confirmed that one of its soldiers was missing in Gaza. The missing soldier named by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as Oron Shaul, 20, was probably killed in or following an attack on an armoured personnel carrier during a bloody battle in Shujai&apos;iya, Gaza City, on Sunday, which killed six others in the vehicle, according to military sources. Hamas said on Sunday evening it had captured an Israeli soldier, whom it named as Oron Shaul, displaying his ID card and military serial number on video. But it failed to produce evidence that the soldier was alive, leading to speculation that Hamas was holding the soldier&apos;s body to use as a bargaining chip with Israel. The Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner told reporters &quot;extensive forensic examination&quot; of the scene of the attack was being undertaken in order to determine the soldier&apos;s fate. The armoured vehicle was struck by possibly multiple missiles, he said. &quot;The result was dramatic. Devastation at the site was huge,&quot; he said. On whether the soldier could still be alive, he added: &quot;Ultimately we don&apos;t have a clear answer \u2026 To be honest we just don&apos;t know.&quot; A high-rise apartment block partly collapsed on Tuesday, killing six Palestinians with German citizenship. The body of a woman hung from the wreckage for several hours before it could be retrieved. Seven people, including four women from one family, were killed in a separate air strike, according to Gaza paramedics. The IDF also said it had located 66 shafts leading to 25 tunnels, six of which had been detonated. Col Uri Gordon, commander of the Nahal brigade, told reporters: &quot;We have located the majority of the tunnels, but have not completed the mapping and destruction.&quot; Israel&apos;s military and political leadership has said the principal goal of the ground operation is to find and destroy tunnels built by Hamas and other militants. Ban, who travelled to Ramallah and Tel Aviv after meetings to discuss ceasefire proposals in Cairo, said at a press conference: &quot;My message to Israelis and Palestinians is the same: stop fighting, start talking and take on the root causes of the conflict so that we are not at the same situation in the next six months or a year.&quot; He condemned rocket fire from Gaza, which he described as &quot;shocking&quot;, but said Israel must exercise &quot;maximum restraint&quot;. He added: &quot;We must address the underlying issues including mutual recognition, occupation, despair and denial of dignity so people will not feel they have to resort to violence as a means of expressing their grievances.&quot; Before arriving in Tel Aviv, Kerry reiterated his support for an immediate ceasefire. He said: &quot;Hamas has a fundamental choice to make and it is a choice that will have a fundamental impact on the people of Gaza. But just reaching a ceasefire is clearly not enough. It is imperative that there be a serious discussion, negotiation addressing the underlying issues that have brought us to where we are today.&quot; He added: &quot;Once a ceasefire has been reached, we are certainly ready to talk through the incredibly complicated underlying issues to this crisis \u2026 The Egyptians have provided a framework and forum for them to be able to come to the table to have a series of discussions.&quot; Kerry said Israel had responded to Hamas rocket fire &quot;as any country has the right to do when it&apos;s under attack, and we support Israel&apos;s right to self defence.&quot; He nevertheless expressed sympathy for victims on &quot;all sides&quot; of the conflict. &quot;We&apos;ve seen too much bloodshed on all sides, including the death of two American citizens, and we have watched the humanitarian crisis grow worse day after day. People have lost their homes, possessions, access to water and food, their entire way of life.&quot; Hamas has rejected Egypt&apos;s week-old proposal for a ceasefire because the group wants guarantees on the easing to the blockade on Gaza, and the release of prisoners.

About 140 militants have been killed in Gaza over the past two weeks, amounting to around 20%-25% of the total Palestinian death toll, which is mostly civilian. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says it has destroyed 30%-40% of militant rocket stocks. Adding in the 2,100-plus rockets fired from Gaza since the start of the conflict, it says the overall rocket capability of Hamas and other groups has been halved. It says there has been a 30% decline in rocket fire in recent days, although the Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner said on Tuesday it was too early to say whether this was a significant trend. Israeli troops on the ground have discovered at least 66 shafts leading to 23 tunnels \u2013 usually used for smuggling and storing goods and weapons \u2013 six of which have now been destroyed. Approximately half the tunnels lead under the border into Israel, says the IDF. According to the military analyst Alex Fishman, about 3,000 tons of explosives have been dropped on Gaza in the first 15 days of the conflict \u2013 more than was deployed in the 22-day Operation Cast Lead in 2008-9. On the other side, by Wednesday morning Hamas had killed 29 soldiers, a huge morale booster to its fighters and a grievous blow to Israel. It says it has also abducted a soldier, though it is thought more likely that it is holding a soldier&apos;s body \u2013 still a significant bargaining chip. Its rocket fire has caused fear and panic among Israelis in south and central Israel, with sirens sounding many times a day warning people to seek shelter. A big achievement from Hamas&apos;s perspective has been the disruption of flights to and from Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport. Airlines from the US, Europe and elsewhere suspended flights, citing security concerns, after a rocket hit a house near the airport. Hamas has rockets in its arsenal capable of reaching most cities and towns in Israel, apart from the far north and south \u2013 a big advance on previous conflicts. The Syrian-made M302 has a range of 160 miles, according to the IDF. However, Hamas&apos;s missiles have so far failed to cause serious damage or casualties. Two Israeli civilians have been killed to date, and more than 420 rockets have been shot down by Israel&apos;s vaunted missile defence system, Iron Dome. The asymmetry between a well-resourced and equipped professional state army and paramilitary groups that have been operating under siege conditions for seven years or more is clear in this conflict. Even so, the IDF has encountered fiercer fighting than it expected on the ground. &quot;We have to admit we were facing good fighters, very well equipped with sophisticated weapons systems, accurate weapons, heavy weapons including mortars, booby traps,&quot; a senior military source told the Guardian after the battle of Shujai&apos;iya, Israel&apos;s bloodiest assault in the two-week Gaza conflict. &quot;It was very difficult fighting. It&apos;s very difficult for us to surprise them. They were simply waiting for us.&quot; He said Hamas had the advantage of knowing when and where Israeli ground forces would strike following warnings given to civilians to evacuate specified areas by given deadlines. Hamas fighters hid in apartment buildings ready to ambush the IDF. They had also booby-trapped buildings and tunnels. Israeli forces have discovered a much more extensive network of tunnels than expected. The labyrinth of interconnected passages, bunkers, command centres, weapons stores and underground rocket-launching sites, with multiple shafts, has been dubbed Lower Gaza by some. Hundreds of thousands of tons of concrete have been used for construction of tunnels, some of which are 30m below ground and run for several miles. The tunnels have posed huge tactical challenges for the IDF. Large numbers of troops are needed to guard military engineers who are exposed to Hamas sniper fire, anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades while working on detonating tunnel shafts. The IDF has tacitly admitted it may not find, let alone destroy, the entire network. &quot;The end position of this mission needs to determine that these [tunnels] no longer lead to Israel,&quot; Lerner said. The senior military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: &quot;Our goal now is to finish the job by destroying as many tunnels as we can, if not all of them. It&apos;s very difficult for me to say all of them because there&apos;s always a chance we don&apos;t know [the location of] all the tunnels \u2013 and what you don&apos;t know, you simply don&apos;t know.&quot; Israel&apos;s political and military leaders will have to weigh the danger of getting drawn deeper into ground fighting in urban areas, where Hamas has considerable tactical advantages and could inflict significant losses on troops. Fishman said diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire were adding to the pressures on the IDF. &quot;We are entering a race against time until some kind of ceasefire is decided. At that point, the political and military echelons will face a genuine dilemma: which infrastructure can [Israel] give up [on destroying] and which infrastructure must be destroyed? For this reason, the army is already focusing its efforts against the most vital infrastructure,&quot; he wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel&apos;s largest-circulation newspaper.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-23T14:47:00Z", "title": "Gaza conflict takes toll on Hamas rocket stocks and tunnels", "sentences": ["A big achievement from Hamas&apos;s perspective has been the disruption of flights to and from Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/gaza-conflict-hamas-rockets-tunnels-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "United Nations", "War crimes", "Law"], "article": "The UN has said that Israel may have committed war crimes in its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, in which hundreds of Palestinian civilians have been killed in two weeks, and voted to launch an international inquiry. The US opposed the move, and 17 countries abstained. &quot;There seems to be a strong possibility that international law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,&quot; Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in the debate in Geneva. Later, Hamas&apos;s leader-in-exile, Khaled Mishal, said the organisation would consider a humanitarian truce in the 16-day conflict in Gaza if Israel agreed to lift its blockade. In comments that appeared to restate the Hamas position set out more than a week ago, Mishal told a news conference in Doha that he would not agree to a full ceasefire until terms had been negotiated. The Egyptian government has proposed both sides halt fighting first, and negotiate soon after. &quot;Everyone wanted us to accept a ceasefire and then negotiate for our rights, we reject this and we reject it again today,&quot; Mishal said. But, he added, Hamas &quot;will not close the door&quot; to a humanitarian truce if Israel ended its siege of Gaza. Mishal&apos;s statement came after the US secretary of state, John Kerry, shuttled between Jerusalem and Ramallah for talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN leaders in an urgent quest for a deal to end the fighting. &quot;We have certainly made small steps forward,&quot; he said between meetings, but added: &quot;There is still work to be done.&quot; Israel continued to pound the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, with hundreds of people trapped in the village of Khuzaar, near Khan Younis, unable to escape the bombardment. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) negotiated a brief pause to allow a convoy of ambulances to evacuate the wounded. Similar lightning evacuations were undertaken in Shujai&apos;iya, scene of a bloody battle on Sunday, and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Aid agencies said a child had been killed every hour on average in the past two days, and there had been a sharp spike in premature births. Gaza officials said more than 3,000 homes had been destroyed or damaged, and 46 schools, 56 mosques, and seven hospitals had been hit. Israel claims that militants fire rockets from and store weapons in civilian buildings. Some airlines that suspended flights in and out of Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport on Tuesday over security concerns extended the measure for a further 24 hours as rocket fire from Gaza continued throughout the day. The US Federal Aviation Authority imposed a flight ban on all US carriers, with other airlines following suit, causing disruption to tourists and business. British Airways and the Israeli national carrier El Al continued to fly to and from Israel. As the death toll on the 16th day of conflict topped 700 \u2013 more than 690 Palestinians and 35 Israelis including three civilians \u2013 Pillay told an emergency debate at the UN human rights council (UNHRC) in Geneva that Israel had not done enough to protect civilians, citing air strikes and the shelling of homes and hospitals. She also condemned Hamas and other militant groups for &quot;indiscriminate attacks&quot; on Israel. Her comments were seen as a warning to remind Israel of its obligations under international law. She also called for an end to the blockade of Gaza, the underlying reason for the conflict and an issue that would have to be tackled if any ceasefire were to endure. The UNHRC backed a resolution calling for the urgent dispatch of &quot;an independent, international commission of inquiry&quot; to investigate violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Israel would be highly unlikely to cooperate with any such inquiry. Its envoy to the council, Eviatar Manor, accused Hamas of committing war crimes and said Israel was acting as any other state would in seeking to defending its citizens. &quot;There can be no moral symmetry between a terrorist aggressor and a democracy defending itself,&quot; he said. Hamas was a terrorist organisation, not the Salvation Army, he said, adding that it was responsible for civilian casualties because it was using people as human shields. Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, appealed to the international community to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza. &quot;How many martyrs must die before Israel puts an end to its aggression?&quot; he asked. In Washington, a state department official said Kerry was expected to remain in the Middle East for the next few days&quot;, possibly moving around the region. Kerry has indicated privately that he does not want to return to the US without securing a ceasefire. US officials rejected the suggestion that his high-profile failure to hold together peace negotiations have reduced his leverage in the region, or led to a diplomatic vacuum which allowed the current conflict to escalate. They pointed out that the current conflict has also escalated beyond hostilities in 2012, when Israel stopped short of launching a ground invasion. While Kerry believes Egypt, which controls border crossings into Gaza, will be central to any negotiated ceasefire, he has acknowledged that the country&apos;s president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, has nowhere near the leverage with Hamas that helped his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, convince the Palestinian side to pause the conflict. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2014.

When we pulled up at the Pyramids on Wednesday, locals peered in the window of our mini-bus and started shouting \u201cIt\u2019s Muhammad Ali!\u201d Maybe King would take that as a compliment, even if Ali, struggling with Parkinson\u2019s disease since 1984, does not stir far from his easy-chair these days. Because, as large a presence as King has been and would love to be again, Ali was once the most famous athlete in the world. He was probably, for a time, the most famous person in the world \u2013 more famous, even, than The Beatles, whom John Lennon reckoned were more famous than Jesus Christ. At his height, Ali happily stood alongside King, and their grins and chutzpah lit up the 60s and 70s. They did not part on the best of terms near the end of his career, but they have been reconciled a good few years now, old bruises healed, bad memories forgotten. Those were crazy days \u2013 and a little of that madness returned to the Egyptian capital this week as King began what, to anyone else, would be an improbable quest: to bring a world heavyweight title fight to a country mired in financial distress, social unrest and parked next to the running sore that is modern Israel. If they did not know King when he walked down the street, there was little doubt they would not forget him. At the Pyramids, he chatted for ages with the young urchins trying to sell their tat, bargaining with them before settling on an agreed sum. He probably drove harder bargains with the casino bosses of Las Vegas, but even some of those lucrative deals cannot have made him smile as much. He was in his element, talking to young hustlers trying to survive. Life, meanwhile, carried on chaotically around us. On Tuesday night, even as he won an assurance from the tourism minister, Hisham Zazou, that his proposal would receive his wholehearted backing, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, was meeting with the president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, to work on a ceasefire in Israel. Airlines had just stopped landing in Tel Aviv, after a bomb near the airport, and the air was thick with uncertainty and tension. There was more at stake here than a mere boxing match. King says he realises that. He says he wants to help Egypt restore its shredded tourism industry (when we went around the Pyramids, there were maybe a few dozen tourists for company; before the revolution, they attracted 20,000 visitors a day). No doubt he does. But he is still in the Don King industry \u2013 and there is business to be done. King has another champion now, the 35-year-old Haitian Bermane Stiverne, and he wants him to defend his World Boxing Council title against the fearsome Deontay Wilder in November \u201cin the shadows of the Pyramids\u201d (or maybe in the more atmospheric setting of Luxor), rounding out a promotional trilogy separated by 40 years: the Rumble in the Jungle, the 1975 Thrilla in Manila and, if he pulls it off, King Of The Nile. A more significant anniversary marks King\u2019s visit, however, one with deep cultural and religious connotations. It is 50 years since Ali visited Egypt, shortly after he took the world heavyweight title from Sonny Liston, then announced he was a Muslim. Overnight, the new champion became a villain in his own land \u2013 but not beyond those gilded shores. There are pictures of Ali visiting Cairo\u2019s Al-Hussein mosque in June of 1964, praying with local devotees (of the original Muhammad), and he pronounced more loudly about his faith than he did about his boxing. In 1975, a year after regaining the title for the third time with that Rumble against George Foreman, Ali told Playboy magazine: \u201cYou can go to Japan, China, all the European, African, Arab, and South American countries and, man, they know me. I can\u2019t name a country where they don\u2019t know me. If another fighter\u2019s goin\u2019 to be that big, he\u2019s goin\u2019 to have to be a Muslim, or else he won\u2019t get to nations like Indonesia, Lebanon, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, and Turkey \u2013 those are all countries that don\u2019t usually follow boxing. He might even have to be named Muhammad because Muhammad is the most common name in the world.\u201d Don King is not a Muslim, but he knows how to be a good guest. All week, he has chanted, \u201cAna Masry! Ana Masry!\u201d (I am an Egyptian), and I\u2019m sure his audience were half way to believing him. He hopes to meet with president Sisi before he returns to the United States next Wednesday and I wanted to know if he would use his people skills for something far more important than this fight: the release of three al-Jazeera journalists jailed for from seven to 10 years for allegedly inciting unrest. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019m getting a good vibe from them.\u201d Part of the sell? Maybe.

While Kerry believes Egypt, which controls border crossings into Gaza, will be central to any negotiated ceasefire, he has acknowledged that the country&apos;s president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, has nowhere near the leverage with Hamas that helped his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, convince the Palestinian side to pause the conflict.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T05:47:55Z", "title": "UN issues Gaza war crimes warning as flights to Israel resume", "sentences": ["Early on Thursday the US Federal Aviation Authority lifted its ban on US airlines flying in and out of Tel Aviv&apos;s Ben Gurion airport."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/un-issues-gaza-war-crimes-warning-as-flights-to-israel-resume"}, {"tags": ["easyJet", "Airline industry", "Business", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Egypt", "Africa", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "EasyJet has forecast a rise in profits of between 14% and 19% this year despite disruption caused by political tension in Israel and Russia. The budget airline said it expected pre-tax profits in the range of \u00a3545m to \u00a3570m for the year to 30 September 2014, up from \u00a3478m last year, assuming no further significant disruption. &quot;This range includes the impact from the situations in Israel, Egypt and Moscow,&quot; said Carolyn McCall, easyJet&apos;s chief executive. EasyJet suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv on Wednesday and Thursday after Ben Gurion airport was targeted by Palestinian rockets. A spokesman for the airline said it was in the process of reviewing the situation, after  the US Federal Aviation Authority lifted its ban on US airlines flying in and out of the airport early on Thursday. Passengers have also been put off from travelling to Russia \u2013 easyJet launched flights to Moscow last year \u2013 and Egypt over recent months amid heightened instability. Investors were left disappointed by easyJet&apos;s first guidance on full-year profits, with shares down almost 4% after the trading update was published. Analysts had forecast pre-tax profits of \u00a3569m, right at the top end of easyJet&apos;s guidance. Reporting on the company&apos;s third quarter performance, McCall said revenue rose by 8.9% over the period, to \u00a31.2bn. The number of passengers carried increased by 9.4% to 17.9m. Revenue per seat rose by 1.7% to \u00a362.47 over the three months to 30 June, helped by the late timing of Easter, which is a popular time to travel and was included in the period this year. The load factor, which reflects the number of seats occupied on flights, was 90.4% in the third quarter, up 2.2 percentage points. EasyJet has increased its capacity, mainly with more flights to and from Gatwick after buying Flybe slots and increasing travel to Italy. McCall said: &quot;We will continue to invest in building leading network positions and this combined with a compelling customer proposition, low cost base and strong balance sheet leaves easyJet well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth and returns. &quot;With 77% of second-half seats now booked, easyJet expects to grow profit before tax from \u00a3478m for the year to 30 September 2013 to a range of \u00a3545m to \u00a3570m for the year to 30 September 2014, assuming no further significant disruption.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T09:38:57Z", "title": "EasyJet expects 14% to 19% profit rise despite Israel and Russia disruption", "sentences": ["EasyJet suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv on Wednesday and Thursday after Ben Gurion airport was targeted by Palestinian rockets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/24/easyjet-expects-profit-rise-despite-israel-russia-disruption"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Geneva conventions", "Palestinian territories", "United Nations", "World news", "Israel", "Hamas", "Law"], "article": "Israel&apos;s accusation that Hamas is using civilians as human shields has grown increasingly strident as the war in Gaza worsens. The charge is laid relentlessly by political and military leaders and media commentators, repeated in conversations by members of the public and echoed in the comments of foreign politicians and diplomats. On the other side of the conflict, the accusation is vigorously denied by Hamas and others in Gaza. The truth is lost amid the propaganda battle being waged alongside the shells, bombs, guns and rockets. What is certain is that the picture is more complicated than either side claims. Deliberately placing non-combatants in and around targets to deter enemy attack \u2013 the definition of human shields \u2013 is illegal under international law. The Geneva conventions state: &quot;The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.&quot; International law also bans the use of medical units or prisoners of war to deter enemy attack. However, even if Hamas were violating the law on this matter, it would not legally justify Israel&apos;s bombing of areas where civilians are known to be. &quot;Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures,&quot; the conventions say. Israel claims Hamas routinely uses hospitals, mosques, schools and private homes to launch rockets at Israel, store weapons, hide command and control centres, shelter military personnel, and conceal tunnel shafts. This is their justification for targeting such places, despite the legal requirement to ensure its attacks are proportional, distinguish between military and civilian objects, and avoid civilian casualties. Israel says it gives due notice of attack \u2013 by phone, text messages, leaflet drops and &quot;warning missiles&quot; \u2013 to give civilians the chance to leave. A typical statement from the Israel Defence Forces, issued in the past few days, says: &quot;While the IDF does everything that it can to avoid civilian casualties, Hamas deliberately puts Palestinian civilian lives in danger. Hamas hides weapons and missile launchers in densely populated areas. Instead of keeping its citizens out of harm&apos;s way, Hamas encourages and even forces Gazans to join its violent resistance against Israel. It sends men, women and children directly into the line of fire to be used as human shields for terrorists.&quot; On Wednesday, the IDF released a series of maps purporting to show Hamas military sites close to \u2013 but not in \u2013 schools, hospitals, mosques and residential buildings. It also released video, which it said showed militants using an ambulance to flee after coming under attack by IDF troops, and said the grounds and vicinity of al-Wafa hospital in Gaza City had been &quot;repeatedly utilised by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad as a command centre, rocket-launching site, and a post enabling terrorists to open fire at soldiers&quot;. Israel has repeatedly targeted the rehabilitation hospital during the course of the conflict, finally destroying the heavily damaged and, by then, empty building on Wednesday. But the hospital&apos;s director rejected the Israeli assertion that the hospital had been used for military purposes by Hamas or other militant groups. In a statement, Basman Alashi said: &quot;Israel has targeted our hospital based on false and misleading claims. They are targeting medical facilities, the wounded, the sick and our children, all over the Gaza Strip. They want us to know that nowhere is safe.&quot; He added: &quot;I hope things calm down as soon as possible. It&apos;s painful to see what&apos;s happening and that the hospital has become a target for military attacks.&quot; The UN&apos;s discovery of arms caches in two of its schools in the past week has given Israel&apos;s assertions credence. &quot;UNRWA [the UN agency for Palestinian refugees] immediately informed all relevant parties and issued a statement strongly condemning the abuse of its premises,&quot; said a spokesman, Chris Gunness. The UN agency UNRWA&apos;s shelters have been shelled on four occasions in recent days, despite officials giving precise coordinates to the IDF. Israel also claimed that Hamas had forced civilians to remain in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujai&apos;iya after the IDF warned them to evacuate ahead of its assault on Sunday. Civilians were being &quot;held as hostages&quot;, said Peter Lerner, an IDF military spokesman. These claims have not been backed up by independent reporting from international journalists covering the war from Gaza. Instead, dispatches from the ground have presented complex reasons why some residents did not evacuate from Shujai&apos;iya and other areas targeted by the IDF. Many said nowhere in Gaza was safe, so they saw little point in abandoning their homes. Others cited worries about not knowing the identities of people who would be their new neighbours; they could be evacuating a familiar neighbourhood for one that was a militant stronghold and others were simply too terrified to go out on the streets. Many media reports said there was no evidence of coercion by Hamas. In fact, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes for what they hope is a safer place. UNRWA reports that more than 140,000 people have sought shelter in its properties; churches and mosques have been overwhelmed by displaced civilians; the grounds of the Shifa hospital in Gaza City have begun to resemble a makeshift refugee camp. These families are in fear of their lives, but they overwhelmingly cite Israeli bombing and shelling as the cause, rather than threats from Hamas. Gaza is one of the most overcrowded places on earth. Almost two million people are crammed into a strip of land just 25 miles long and between three and a half and seven miles wide \u2013 roughly the same size as the Isle of Wight. In general there are few opportunities to leave; and in the midst of a conflict such as this, there is no exit. The current war is not being fought on a conventional battlefield. Israel is pounding Gaza from the air, and its troops are increasingly fighting battles against a guerrilla army in densely populated urban areas \u2013 which constitute much of the Gaza Strip. As Israeli tanks and troops push further into the towns and cities, it is increasingly likely that Hamas will launch attacks from positions close to civilian buildings. The separation between &quot;civilian&quot; and &quot;military&quot; in Gaza is much more blurred than with a conventional army \u2013 both physically and in the Gazan psyche. Hamas and other militants are embedded in the population. Their fighters are not quartered in military barracks, but sleep at night in their family homes. While it is not difficult to find antipathy to Hamas on the streets of Gaza in quiet times, most people defend their &quot;right to resist&quot; \u2013 and under such sustained military attack, support for Hamas rises. Israel, meanwhile, does not have an unblemished record in the use of human shields. In 2010, two soldiers were convicted in an IDF military court of using an 11-year-old Palestinian boy as a human shield in its 2008-09 operation in Gaza. The pair ordered the child to search bags they suspected of being booby-trapped. It was the first conviction of what is known within the IDF as the &quot;neighbour procedure&quot; \u2013 forcing civilians to assist troops in military operations. Investigations by news organisations and human rights groups have suggested the IDF has used Palestinians as human shields in operations in both Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, in response to Israel&apos;s assertions that Hamas situates its military centres in civilian areas, some have pointed out that the IDF&apos;s headquarters, the Kiriya, is in central Tel Aviv, surrounded by a hospital, blocks of flats, shopping centres and offices.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T19:55:21Z", "title": "In Gaza, Hamas fighters are among civilians.

After hours of sweat and graft, the players are still rapt as the 35-year-old maestro gives pointers on dynamics in\u00a0Hebrew flecked with &quot;crescendo&quot; and &quot;pianissimo&quot;. Raising a pencil, his\u00a0Arabic &quot;Yalla&quot; (&quot;let&apos;s go&quot;) could also\u00a0be Hebrew slang. The string players are a local Palestinian Arab violinist, Feras Machour, aged 18, and three Jewish players in their early 20s \u2013 all four Israeli. The Jewish students have come from Tel Aviv, a two-hour bus ride away, to the country&apos;s biggest Palestinian Arab city. Although Nazareth&apos;s pinkish-stone Ottoman mansions now host gourmet restaurants, Ohad Cohen, a violinist, says that, for most Israelis, the city is still synonymous with falafel joints. &quot;We&apos;re trying to compete with the food,&quot; Abboud-Ashkar interjects drily, &quot;and attract people for the music.&quot; &quot;The first time I stood in front of Jewish kids, coaching a quartet,&quot; he tells me later, &quot;it was one of the most unusual moments of my life. There&apos;s so\u00a0much separation between the communities here, so little interaction, and so many stereotypes and misconceptions&quot; \u2013 not least that &quot;an Arab can&apos;t play Mozart well.&quot; Yet &quot;after an hour or two,\u00a0it felt like any other rehearsal&quot;. Abboud-Ashkar was speaking during\u00a0rehearsals for the chamber music festival Incontri in Terra di Siena,\u00a0in Tuscany. Earlier this week, he\u00a0telephoned me from Italy to say the\u00a0rehearsals had continued, despite mounting tensions within Israel due to\u00a0the military operation in Gaza. Demonstrations in Nazareth and other Palestinian Israeli cities against civilian deaths brought clashes with the police. &quot;This is the worst I can recall in terms of the level of anger and hatred I&apos;ve witnessed,&quot; he\u00a0says. &quot;But despite what parents were hearing on the news about &apos;riots&apos; in Nazareth, the students still came. We continued working together.&quot; The quintet is led by Abboud-Ashkar&apos;s elder brother, the concert pianist Saleem Ashkar, aged 37, who is to resume his Beethoven sonata cycle at the Sage Gateshead this autumn. The brothers from Nazareth are alumni of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra of young pan-Arab and Jewish musicians co-founded in 1999 by Edward Said and Daniel Barenboim. Their youth ensembles are one spinoff of a groundbreaking programme of music education aimed primarily at Palestinian Israelis \u2013 who number more than one in\u00a0five Israeli citizens \u2013 and led from within that community. Inside Israel \u2013\u00a0where the Divan has never performed \u2013 &quot;every past effort to bring people together through classical music miserably failed,&quot; Nabeel says, &quot;because there was not enough investment in the Arab\u00a0community so they could meet as\u00a0equals. This is what we&apos;re doing: creating equal opportunities for the Arab community, and using that to\u00a0bring Arab and Jewish together.&quot; The violinist spoke to me at his home in Nazareth as tensions were already flaring over the killings of three\u00a0Israeli teenagers and a teenage Palestinian. &quot;Whenever there&apos;s an attack on Gaza, a kidnapping, it causes things to polarise here. But that makes it even more important to continue doing what we do.&quot; The younger brother returned from music studies in Germany to found the\u00a0Barenboim-Said Conservatory in Nazareth in 2006, with 25 students. It was renamed the Polyphony Conservatory two years ago (and is now financially independent of the Barenboim-Said Foundation). Though still housed in makeshift premises, it has 130 students, 30 of them in a branch in Jaffa. More than 90% are Palestinian Israeli. Its annual budget is $900,000, one third of\u00a0which is covered by an three-year EU grant; a\u00a0third by donations to the Polyphony Foundation in New York, set up in 2011 with financiers Craig and Deborah Cogut; and another third generated locally. Nabeel, Polyphony&apos;s artistic director and previously a soloist with the Jerusalem Camerata and Haifa Symphony orchestras, received the Yoko Ono Lennon Courage\u00a0Award for the Arts in 2012.

Photograph: Paul Flanagan    One lesson he took from the Divan (&quot;I never missed a year&quot;) is\u00a0that music is &quot;not just something in a concert hall, but an influence on society outside&quot;. Western classical music is &quot;part of the identity of so many communities globally. That&apos;s why it&apos;s the best medium to work with. It enables young people to create something beautiful together that needs commitment \u2013 to music and to\u00a0each other.&quot; This, for him, is the common ground from which to explore differences. The impetus is &quot;an urge coming from our region. It&apos;s a survival need \u2013 because what&apos;s the alternative?&quot; It was the divided response to Israel&apos;s military assault on Gaza in 2008/9 that\u00a0spurred on their move beyond the conservatory. &quot;As an Arab-Israeli citizen I felt the need to step up,&quot; says Nabeel. Houses in Nazareth are crammed on to\u00a0its hillsides. Across a bypass is the more expansive Nazareth Ilit (Upper Nazareth), built as a Jewish city overlooking the Arab one. In the rest of\u00a0Galilee \u2013 where more than half of Palestinian Israelis live \u2013 Arab and Jewish towns are also distinct. Under an official policy to &quot;Judaise the Galilee&quot;, settlements were built here before those in the territories occupied after the 1967 war. It\u00a0was an &quot;ongoing effort\u00a0to balance Arabs and Jews,&quot; Nabeel says, driving through the countryside. &quot;The two communities are\u00a0physically close, but there&apos;s no interaction.&quot; That divorce is\u00a0mirrored in the school system, where Arabic schools stress science to\u00a0the neglect of the\u00a0humanities. Nabeel and his wife, Lilian, a science teacher, share with his parents the house built by his grandmother. Its garden of fig and apricot trees is a rare oasis in a city whose residents are obliged to build on every spare patch of\u00a0land. As children, the brothers were the only classical pianist and violinist in Nazareth, ferried to lessons and concerts in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Their father, Duaibis, a\u00a0telecoms engineer, was a communist (at a time when many progressive Arabs were) with a printing press and a passion for classical music. Their mother, Mahaa, taught in a school for the deaf and blind. Nabeel, a\u00a0graduate of Tel Aviv University in music and physics (&quot;the mentality of the minority \u2013 I had to secure Plan B&quot;), built on Orpheus, the non-profit music education foundation that was a\u00a0labour\u00a0of love for his father. Nazareth is steeped in Arab music (the hometown of oud players Trio Joubran). The Polyphony conservatories teach western classical. &quot;For Arab people, it&apos;s\u00a0a way of being heard,&quot; Nabeel says. &quot;By mastering it, they become part of a\u00a0larger world.&quot; Despite its being &quot;new to the Arab community in Israel,&quot; they now have a waiting list. In a city with bilingual Arabic-Hebrew signage, the muezzin also vies with church bells: some 55% of Nazarenes are Muslim; 45% are Christian. There is rough religious and gender parity in the student intake. A dozen Jewish students have joined from nearby towns and kibbutzim. In 2012, two violin students, Feras Machour (of the\u00a0aforementioned quintet) and Yamen Saadi, won Israel&apos;s biennial Paul Ben-Haim competition, the first Palestinian Israelis to do so. There is, Nabeel says, &quot;no compromise on the musical level to do a social project&quot;. Saleem, who came to the Yehudi Menuhin school in Britain aged 13, before music school in Jerusalem and London&apos;s Royal Academy of Music, was a soloist with the Israel Philharmonic at 17. &quot;If I stand on stage in Tel Aviv and they clap,&quot; he says, &quot;they&apos;re realising how a Palestinian can become part of the country. If we hide, it doesn&apos;t play into our hands, but into those who want us away from here.&quot; Some people would see his presence on stage as proof of equal opportunity. &quot;That&apos;s absolute rubbish,&quot; he responds. &quot;I\u00a0didn&apos;t come out of the system. There\u00a0was no system. I had to leave to\u00a0develop. I want a child who wants to study piano or violin to live in this city. It&apos;s not about pretending inequality doesn&apos;t exist; it&apos;s about correcting it.&quot; The pianist (who lives in Berlin) is artistic director of the Galilee Chamber Orchestra, formed in 2012. Of its 32 professional musicians from across Israel, six are Palestinian Arab \u2013 though\u00a0the aim is an &quot;equal presence&quot;. In the Youth Orchestra also under Polyphony&apos;s umbrella, half of the 50 players are Jewish, from the Jerusalem Music Centre. They come to\u00a0Nazareth for seminars on music and society. &quot;It&apos;s to stimulate the kids, not force them,&quot; Nabeel says. &quot;We trust they&apos;ll ask the questions \u2013 and they do.&quot; As well as playing in Israel, the ensembles tour abroad, cementing friendships. Saleem sees the project as\u00a0&quot;anything but cosmetic. We&apos;re not aiming for symbolic value; it&apos;s not about Arabs and Jews playing at weekends. We&apos;re investing in our youth.&quot; During weekend exams at the conservatory, Nabeel instructs a flautist and a trumpeter in Arabic, switching to\u00a0Hebrew for the French horn player. Younger children, such as the recorder player in a flowery jumpsuit, may not yet have mastered Hebrew. Whole families are present, sitting on the edge\u00a0of their seats, filming on smartphones. Nabeel is the sole Arabic speaker on the panel. Of 27 teachers, only two are Palestinian Israeli. Most drive from Tel Aviv each week \u2013 drawn, they say, by the students&apos; talent and discipline. Nabeel hopes the imbalance will shift as graduates return to teach. But Polyphony goes beyond professional musicianship. Another lesson Nabeel learned from the Divan was &quot;how little Arab and Jewish people know about each other, and how difficult it is to change what they think they know when they&apos;re 24 or 25&quot;. The Alhan (&quot;melody&quot; in Arabic) programme brings non-instrumental music appreciation to 2,400 children in 12\u00a0Arabic primary schools. Next year it\u00a0extends to a total of 30, including four Hebrew schools, reaching up to 5,000 children; and to 25 Hebrew and 15 Arabic kindergartens. Not only will children study the same syllabus of western classical, Arab and Israeli music, but the groups come together during the year for classical music concerts, creating what Nabeel sees as &quot;rich interaction in a way that hasn&apos;t happened before&quot;. The Arab-Jewish Galil School in Eshbal, 40 minutes&apos; drive north of Nazareth past sunflower fields and olive groves, is one of only a\u00a0handful of bilingual schools in Israel, and a harbinger of the scheme. The principal, Kemal Al Munis, tells me\u00a0the music input has markedly improved the atmosphere: &quot;Music nurtures the soul of the students.&quot; At his home in Tel Aviv, Dan Sagiv, Polyphony&apos;s pedagogic adviser from the Levinsky College of Education, hails this as a &quot;historic moment&quot;. In a system so split, he is training 70 teachers together in an identical music curriculum for Hebrew and Arabic schools. Sagiv, 37, a saxophonist and &quot;music activist&quot; who spent six years in Arabic schools in Galilee, says: &quot;I believe with my skills I can change how society looks. There&apos;s a lot of people doing political discussion, and not enough doing structural work from the bottom.&quot; The Levinsky College and Jerusalem Music Centre are among partners sought out by Polyphony. The Ministry of Education recommends its programmes, though it gives no direct funding. As Nabeel sees it, &quot;the Arab community in Israel is torn. There&apos;s a strong, natural connection to the Palestinian cause while trying to integrate into Israeli society. The fact that I&apos;m reaching out as a citizen to Israeli Jewish institutions to create a\u00a0better, alternative reality doesn&apos;t compromise my own identity.&quot; One aim is to &quot;empower the people who believe in finding ways to live together. Their voices are not heard enough. The events are far louder.&quot; While music education is sometimes dubiously advocated as a counter to militancy, for Nabeel it is &quot;every child&apos;s right. Music will definitely take people away from violence: it will help them listen and respond in a more measured way. But it\u00a0doesn&apos;t take them away from what they believe in. If you educate people, you\u00a0give them more efficient tools to express what they believe, and stand up for themselves.&quot; One gifted graduate of Nazareth, Mais Hriesh, a flautist aged 19, has just\u00a0finished her first year&apos;s scholarship\u00a0in the US, studying for a double major in human rights and music. Recalling an argument with Jewish friends in the\u00a0Youth Orchestra about a drive she opposes to enlist Palestinian Christians in the army, she says: &quot;They know my position. But afterwards we respected each other. We have different perspectives, but that doesn&apos;t prevent us from playing together. We don&apos;t pretend everything&apos;s pink and perfect. We just try to create the best musical masterpieces we can.&quot; \u2022 The Italian festival Incontri in Terra di Siena takes place every summer at La Foce, Val d&apos;Orcia, Tuscany. Polyphony ensembles will take part in the finale on 27 July.

As the violence that has consumed that tiny strip of land for the past 18 days ignited in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Araj met his own premature and brutal end. The young chef from Darna, one of Ramallah&apos;s best known restaurants, was shot dead in clashes between protesters and Israeli forces at the notorious Qalandiya checkpoint. At his funeral on Friday, squeezed between the noon prayers and the start of more confrontations, a family friend said he had seen Araj&apos;s body in the morgue. &quot;No one could recognise him \u2013 the bullet had destroyed his face,&quot; said Raja Hananiya, 37, adding that he was &quot;a nice boy, always smiling and joking&quot;. Outside the Qalandiya refugee camp, where Araj was buried on the final Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, fresh tyres for burning had been placed on the main road leading to the checkpoint amid rubble, broken glass, scorched debris and the spent live ammunition cases from the night before. By mid-afternoon, at least five more Palestinians had been killed, bringing the death toll to seven, and Ramallah&apos;s public hospital, already reeling from the 250 or so injured people who were brought in on Thursday night, was braced for a fresh influx.     Clashes broke out between protesters and Israeli forces at the notorious Qalandiya checkpoint. Graphic: Guardian     Nearly all the injuries were gunshot wounds to the head, chest, stomach and limbs, and four or five people were still in intensive care, said a doctor in the hospital&apos;s emergency department, who was not authorised to speak to the media. &quot;Ambulances were coming every minute. We have seen this before but not since the intifada,&quot; he said, referring to the Palestinian uprising from 2000 to 2005. Thursday night&apos;s protest against the Israeli military onslaught in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll was the largest seen in the West Bank since the second intifada, with estimates varying from 10,000 to 25,000. Unusually, women, children and the elderly joined the march from Ramallah to Qalandiya, where some tried to breach the heavily manned checkpoint in an effort to reach Jerusalem. &quot;We went to show solidarity with the people of Gaza,&quot; said Mahmoud Amar, 27. &quot;We are very angry about what&apos;s happening in Gaza \u2013 specifically the shelling of the [UN] school, and the killing of civilians in general.&quot; But, according to Amar and others, the protest also reflected the mounting frustration of Palestinians in the West Bank over the continued Israeli occupation and diminishing hopes for a Palestinian state. &quot;People are exploding,&quot; said Amar. The gym trainer said he had no political affiliation, but support for Hamas was &quot;up about 200%&quot;. The militant group&apos;s resistance to Israel&apos;s military campaign &quot;is giving us a boost, bringing pride and dignity to our people,&quot; he said, adding that he would join protests again &quot;today and everyday&quot;. As Araj&apos;s body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag and adorned with flowers, was carried aloft from the mosque to the cemetery, Mohammed Assaf, 15, struggled with crutches and a bandaged leg to keep up with the crowd. He had been throwing stones at soldiers at the checkpoint when they opened fire with live ammunition. A bullet fragment struck his leg. &quot;Everybody joined the protest. There was no one left in the camp,&quot; he said. &quot;Hamas are heroes.&quot; On Friday, four Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces, and a fifth appeared to have been shot dead by a settler. Two, aged 21 and 22, were shot during a protest in the village of Hawara near Nablus in the north of the West Bank, said Mazen al-Hammouz, director of the city&apos;s Rafidiyeh hospital. Another three, one aged 47 and another 27, were shot in Beit Omar, near the city of Hebron, in the south. In Iran, hundreds of thousands of people took part in nationwide rallies in solidarity with Palestinians. Images showed demonstrators holding banners, such as one reading &quot;Stop killing babies in Gaza.&quot; A group of demonstrators set fire to Israeli flags and carried effigies of Israeli and American politicians. Iran&apos;s president, Hassan Rouhani, was among many senior officials who participated in rallies. Earlier in the week a group of prominent opposition activists in Iran, many of whom have endured lengthy jail terms in recent years, protested in support of Gaza in front of the UN offices in Tehran. The celebrated film-maker Jafar Panahi was among them. Iran&apos;s Nobel peace prize laureate, Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer and human rights activist who currently lives in exile, also expressed serious concerns. &quot;Deliberate targeting of civilian areas by anyone is a violation of international law,&quot; she said in a joint statement signed by other female Nobel laureates. &quot;Israel&apos;s continuing collective punishment of the Palestinian people because of its ongoing war of attrition against Hamas is a war crime.&quot; About 2,000 people protested in Jordan&apos;s capital, Amman, after Friday prayers, chanting: &quot;We sacrifice our blood and souls for you, Gaza&quot; and &quot;Bomb and destroy Tel Aviv&quot;. Protests were held in the northern cities of Zarqa and Irbid as well as in the south, in Karak.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said he was confident of a breakthrough despite a reported decision by Israel&apos;s cabinet to reject the proposed terms. Israeli officials later announced a 12-hour &quot;pause&quot; from 8am on Saturday. Hamas was said to have agreed, according to al-Quds TV. But in one of a flurry of contradictory moves, Israel&apos;s defence minister also warned that the army was preparing to expand ground operations in the coastal enclave, where the offensive has already claimed almost 900 Palestinian lives, three-quarters of them civilians. Israeli tank shelling killed 18 Palestinians from a single family in southern Gaza on Saturday, Reuters reported, shortly before the 12-hour pause came into effect.  Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said that the Al-Najar family had been trapped inside their house in Khuzaa village east of Khan Younis since Thursday and that many others were wounded in Israeli tank shelling.  Hamas has also signalled its opposition to the terms of the US ceasefire plan, which it deemed too favourable to Israel. Its leader, Khaled Meshaal, has insisted on an end to the siege of Gaza; Israel on an end to cross-border attacks. The gap between the two sides remains wide. &quot;We are working toward a brief seven days of peace,&quot; Kerry said in Cairo. &quot;Seven days of a humanitarian ceasefire in honour of Eid in order to be able to bring people together to try to work to create a more durable, sustainable ceasefire for the long run. &quot;The basic outline is approved by everyone. People believe that if the structures are right, a ceasefire is right. But it obviously has to be in ways that either side feels prejudiced.&quot; Israel, he said, &quot;had some opposition to some concepts.&quot; From Cairo, Kerry will fly to Paris, where he will meet officials from France, the UK and EU as well as Turkey and Qatar \u2013 two countries with influence over Hamas. &quot;The whole world is watching tragic moment after tragic moment unfold and wondering when everyone is going to come to the their senses,&quot; he said. Underlining the scale of the crisis, Unrwa, the UN refugee agency, said 160,000 people were now seeking shelter at its facilities. Palestinian militants again fired rockets from Gaza, triggering sirens across southern and central Israel, including at the main airport. No injuries were reported, with the Iron Dome interceptor system knocking out many of the missiles. Israel army radio reported that Binyamin Netanyahu and his cabinet had been divided over the wisdom of accepting Kerry&apos;s proposal, which was supported by the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon. Hawkish ministers were said to favour widening the ground operation in Gaza and warning against any gain for Hamas. Under the US plan, Israeli troops could stay behind after a ceasefire to continue destroying cross-border tunnels. A week-long truce would be followed by talks on more permanent arrangements, under Egyptian supervision. General Sami Turgeman, head of Israel&apos;s southern command, said his forces needed more time to destroy the tunnels. Hinting at the growing pressure for a ceasefire, he said: &quot;We know that there are other timetables that can affect us, and we will use all the time that we have at our disposal.&quot; Turgeman said Hamas fighters were in poor shape and were finding it harder to launch rockets into Israel. At least five West Bank deaths on Friday followed a big demonstration on Thursday night at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah, in which 10,000 demonstrators marched in solidarity with Gaza. Two men were shot dead by Israeli troops and about 250 people injured, mostly from gunshots. &quot;Ambulances were coming every minute,&quot; said a doctor in the hospital&apos;s emergency department. &quot;We have seen this before but not since the intifada,&quot; he said, referring to the last Palestinian uprising. Gaza officials said Israeli strikes killed 55 Palestinians on Friday, including the head of media operations for Hamas and his son.  Israel announced that an army reservist had been killed in Gaza, bringing to 34 the number of soldiers lost since its ground offensive began. The Israeli military said that one of its soldiers who had been missing since a battle in Shujai&apos;iya on Sunday was dead. &quot;Oron Shaul is defined as &apos;a soldier killed in action whose burial site is unknown&apos;,&quot; said an Israel Defence Forces statement. The soldier was in an armoured vehicle ambushed by Palestinians. The bodies of six other infantrymen were recovered but Shaul&apos;s fate had been unclear. If Hamas is holding Shaul&apos;s body, that may give the group leverage in bargaining for the release of prisoners which it is demanding as part of a ceasefire deal. Unrwa issued a strongly worded statement about the Israeli military when a team including an international weapons expert visited the school at Beit Hanoun which came under attack on Thursday, causing at least 15 deaths and 200 injuries. &quot;The aim of the visit to the site was to survey the scene in the aftermath of the incident,&quot; Unrwa said. &quot;The Israeli army had been notified in advance about the composition of the team, the time and purpose of the visit. The mission had to be cut short and the team was forced to leave the area after gunfire around the school. We again underline our call for an immediate and comprehensive investigation.&quot; Violence in the Palestinian territories was echoed in neighbouring Jordan, where about 2,000 people demonstrated in Amman after Friday prayers, chanting: &quot;We sacrifice our blood and souls for you, Gaza&quot; and &quot;Bomb and destroy Tel Aviv.&quot; Protests were held in the northern cities of Zarqa and Irbid as well as in the south, in Karak.

But from the start, the life span of that support was bound to be short. As a brief ceasefire was reached on Saturday, it may already be waning. The reason can be summed up as follows: the immediate casus belli \u2013 Hamas aggression \u2013 appears to justify Israel&apos;s actions. But on closer inspection, threats against civilians fade compared to actual carnage among civilians \u2013 Palestinians. Zooming out, the long-term context of the conflict is increasingly indefensible. Yet Israel&apos;s argument for the war depends on immediate justifications and ignores the context. To compensate, Israel is fixated on narrative, in the deep conviction that a campaign of slogans and images, known as &quot;hasbara&quot;, will work. Start with the immediate pretext for the war: no one can allow rocket fire at civilians or terrorists&apos; infiltration through tunnels. But many also know that both Israel and Hamas have played the game of provocations leading here. Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in a double rage following a Hamas-Fatah reconciliation agreement and the murder of three Israeli teens in June, undertook a massive sweep against Hamas in the West Bank (producing no evidence that the latter committed the murders). The move was bound to elicit a reaction. Wartime realities further erode Israel&apos;s case. Ironically, as the Iron Dome system protects Israelis from Hamas rockets, it highlights Palestinian civilians&apos; helplessness. And it is tough to link the aim of destroying tunnels with the bombing of a UN school sheltering those who had fled their homes. Then there&apos;s the long view. Protective Edge represents the third war in five years, the umpteenth failure of peace negotiations that Netanyahu never intended would succeed. The international community tolerated Cast Lead, a Gaza war in 2008-9 (at least while it was happening) in part because then-prime minister Ehud Olmert had truly sought for long-term resolution through negotiations and concessions, but failed. Under Netanyahu, Israel&apos;s image as a rejectionist is more entrenched than ever. Israelis hold the opposite view. For them, the last few years were a time of relative calm. They traded suicide bombs of the early 2000s for regular Gaza &quot;operations&quot; with low Israeli casualties, in the firm belief that it cannot be otherwise. They repress Palestinian statelessness and deep constraints on people, movement, goods, livelihood; they believe Gaza is unoccupied. They remember the conflict when Israelis are victims: when youngsters are murdered and rockets are fired. For Israel, this is a war against Hamas that started a few weeks ago. Outsiders increasingly see it as war against Gaza for years, and against Palestinians for decades. In that environment, it doesn&apos;t matter who fired at the UN school. People were killed because of a war, because of the big picture, which doesn&apos;t favour Israel. Not wishing to address the big picture, Israel has embraced hasbara to explain its pinpointed strikes. The strategy fails on multiple levels. In general, Israeli hasbara observes only those short-term arguments for the war. But it drills down even further, to explain tactics and incidents. The UN school, like other cases before it, could be reduced to a whodunnit in the grimmest of games: Who fired the shot? Did Palestinians doctor the photos? Evidence-doubting is becoming a favourite game. But as the war heats up, the global media pay closer attention to the whole situation. The world is able to pan out to see the whole picture, while Israel is zeroing in. Another problem is that hasbara serves up pith instead of policy. From its Twitter account, the IDF offers these formulations: &quot;Hamas does not exist for the people of Gaza; it abuses its people in order to exist.&quot; &quot;Israel uses its weapons to protect civilians; Hamas uses its civilians to protect weapons.&quot; The slogans are augmented by flashy graphics that could grace a magazine but are no substitute for solutions. Netanyahu may know that the cartoon bomb he flashed in his 2012 United Nations speech about the Iranian nuclear threat yielded jokes. This time, no one is laughing. Worse still, the scent of hasbara taints even clearly legitimate actions. Thus: &quot;IDF soldiers were rushed by a female suicide bomber in Gaza. They were able to neutralise the threat,&quot; reads another message. Surely everyone can agree on the need to kill a suicide bomber before she strikes, if necessary. But the euphemistic self-justifications that are so overused in far less clear situations can cause momentary doubt even here. By ignoring and perpetuating the long-term conflict, obsessively reading only the very, very short term, and by dressing up its actions in cheap linguistic clothes, Israel&apos;s communications may backfire among precisely those who need to be convinced. There are two paths to understanding this conflict \u2013 Israel&apos;s and those seen by the outside world. Increasingly, they do not cross.

They were mostly families, some with their dogs, some pushing strollers. Among them was David Broza, one of Israel&apos;s best-loved\u00a0musicians. They carried no banners and chanted no slogans, but the message of their small demonstration \u2013 their fourth in recent weeks \u2013 was clear from their T-shirts. In black lettering on white cloth, the words in both Hebrew and Arabic read: &quot;We march together, hand in hand.&quot; Most of the group of about 200 were connected to a school at the starting point of their walk. The Hand in Hand school is unique in Jerusalem for being a mixed bilingual establishment of Jewish and Palestinian children and staff, with a strong ethos of coexistence and peace. It is one of just five such schools in Israel; all others are segregated. Maya Frankforter, a Jewish parent, said the school community had decided to march to protest at the violence that erupted in Jerusalem following the murders of three Jewish youths and a Palestinian teenager last month and the ensuing horror in Gaza. She said the demonstrations were &quot;like an island of strength, because I&apos;ve been feeling suffocated, hopeless and helpless. This empowers me.&quot; Palestinian teacher Widad Naoum said she, too, drew comfort from the protests. &quot;People see me as the enemy. Every day, they point the finger at me. They judge me because I am Arab, no matter what I think or do.&quot; The demonstrators soon encountered opposition from a handful of youths, who shouted &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;go back to Gaza&quot;. On previous marches, women protesters have had the words &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;whore&quot; screamed in their faces. The parents do their best to shield the children from the abuse. The picture has been repeated in many cities in Israel in recent weeks. Protests against the bloodshed in Gaza have attracted much smaller numbers than in previous conflicts, in a reflection of the diminishing weight of the &quot;peace camp&quot; in Israeli society. Last weekend protesters in the northern city of Haifa were assaulted by rightwing activists, who beat up the Arab deputy mayor and his son. Police have been forced to protect a series of peace marches in Tel Aviv, including one last week that was pelted with eggs and plastic bottles. A public reading of ex-soldiers&apos; testimonies about their role in previous conflicts in Gaza, organised by Breaking the Silence, a group of veteran combatants dedicated to exposing military injustices, was barracked by up to 100 extremists. It is a big contrast with the 400,000 people \u2013 then almost a tenth of the country&apos;s population \u2013 who took to the streets in 1986 to protest about Israel&apos;s war in Lebanon. In 1995, 100,000 people attended the rally in support of the Oslo accords at which prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated. And in 2009 several thousand people joined peace marches during Operation Cast Lead, Israel&apos;s three-week assault on Gaza. Since the start of the current conflict, protests have generally attracted a few hundred, with last Saturday&apos;s march in Tel Aviv mustering around 1,000. After another week of carnage, activists were hoping for a bigger demonstration in the city on Saturday night. The reasons for the decline of Israel&apos;s peace movement are, inevitably, complex and interrelated. They include the failures of the Oslo accords and of successive attempts to forge a peace deal; the growing voice of the extreme right in Israeli politics; the &quot;normalisation&quot; of the 47-year-long occupation; and the relative marginalisation of the Palestinian cause both in Israel and internationally. Added to that mix is weariness and hopelessness. &quot;I think the peace movement became frustrated that nothing changes,&quot; said Maayan Dak of the Women&apos;s Coalition for Peace. &quot;Things just repeat. People feel there is no point.&quot; According to Tamar Hermann, author of The Israeli Peace Movement: A Shattered Dream, the decline of the Israeli peace camp began in the aftermath of the 1993 Oslo accords. &quot;Most people felt the government was now taking care of the matter: they could do other things,&quot; she said. &quot;And when they realised Oslo wasn&apos;t working, they still didn&apos;t want to protest for fear they would inadvertently be joining forces with the [anti-Oslo] rightwing.&quot; Other factors she identifies as contributing to the peace camp&apos;s contraction include the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising \u2013 &quot;when buses are exploding in the street, it&apos;s hard to call for peace&quot; \u2013 and the shifts in Israeli politics over recent years. People on the left or centre moved to the centre or the right, and people on the far left became more radicalised, supporting a binational state or the boycott movement, she said. &quot;They lost contact with the mainstream.&quot; Uprisings elsewhere in the Middle East, and the increasing focus on the Iranian nuclear threat, pushed the Palestinian cause to the margins. &quot;The Palestinians were not perceived as a strategic threat to Israel&apos;s national security,&quot; said Hermann. &quot;People started to believe that they could go on living this for many years. The peace camp was looked on as anachronistic.&quot; Others cite the new threat they feel from rockets threatening major population centres, and from militants using tunnels to infiltrate Israeli communities, possibly to grab hostages and smuggle them back into Gaza. Meanwhile, the Israeli right has become ever more strident. A political culture of antagonism towards and antagonism towards Israeli-Arabs, who make up 20% of the population has fuelled extremism, according to activists on the left. &quot;Politicians have given legitimacy to extremism. Rightwing violence does not come out of nowhere,&quot; said Dak. One activist, who asked not to be named, said: &quot;It&apos;s never been like this before, we&apos;ve never seen this atmosphere of fear and attacks on protests.&quot; Frankforter echoed his view: &quot;The atmosphere in Jerusalem, and Israel as a whole, is very scary. I never felt fear before. I felt frustrated and isolated in previous wars, but never physical fear. People are frightened to speak out. Something is broken in Israel.&quot; Some say the lack of a broader context to the current violence in Gaza is part of the problem in winning support for the peace movement. &quot;Lots of people are appalled at the killing of children and the level of destruction. But they don&apos;t connect that to the occupation: they don&apos;t see it as part of a bigger pattern,&quot; said the activist. Peace, said Yehuda Shaul of Breaking The Silence, &quot;is a word that has lost its meaning. [Israeli prime minister Binyamin] Netanyahu, [hard right politician Naftali] Bennett, [Palestinian president Mahmoud] Abbas, even Hamas \u2013 they all say they want peace. The real question is: are you willing to end the occupation? Most Israelis don&apos;t understand the context of the occupation, that&apos;s why people are so silent.&quot; If current efforts to forge a ceasefire deal fail, and the violence in Gaza worsens, protests may grow. Back at the Hand in Hand school, Jewish and Palestinian parents and staff are meeting regularly, despite being in the midst of the long summer vacation, to seek ways to hold their community together and spread a message of peace. &quot;We&apos;re together, and that&apos;s the way it should be,&quot; said Frankforter. &quot;The most important thing is we try to build a life together. But it&apos;s getting harder.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-26T22:05:34Z", "title": "Protest is latest casualty in Israel as despair and hopelessness set in", "sentences": ["Police have been forced to protect a series of peace marches in Tel Aviv, including one last week that was pelted with eggs and plastic bottles.", "Since the start of the current conflict, protests have generally attracted a few hundred, with last Saturday&apos;s march in Tel Aviv mustering around 1,000."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/26/gaza-israel-palestinian-protest"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "     Hamas has announced a 24-hour ceasefire in Gaza from 2pm local time on Sunday, just hours after Israel resumed its military operation following fresh rocket fire. There was no immediate response from Israel to Hamas&apos;s move. &quot;In response to UN intervention and considering the situation of our people and the occasion of Eid, it has been agreed among resistance factions to endorse a 24-hour humanitarian calm, starting from 2pm on Sunday [midday BST],&quot; Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan and is one of the most important holidays in the Muslim calendar, is set to begin on Monday. But shortly after the ceasefire was to have started warning sirens sounded in southern Israel and the military said three rockets landed in the area, without causing casualties or damage. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told US TV: &quot;Hamas doesn&apos;t even accept its own ceasefire; it&apos;s continuing to fire at us as we speak.&quot; Israel called off its own unilateral ceasefire earlier on Sunday after renewed rocket fire from Gaza. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said one of its soldiers was killed by a rocket on Sunday morning, bringing the total number of military deaths to 43. Three civilians have been killed in Israel; more than 1,000 Palestinians have died. Following a 12-hour humanitarian pause in its bombardment on Saturday, Israel initially extended its ceasefire by four hours, and then a further 24 hours, until midnight on Sunday. However, in a statement on Sunday morning, the IDF said: &quot;Following Hamas&apos; incessant rocket fire throughout the humanitarian window, which was agreed upon for the welfare of the civilian population in Gaza, the IDF will now resume its aerial, naval and ground activity in the Gaza Strip.&quot; Following the IDF&apos;s announcement, there were reports of three deaths in Gaza as Israeli tanks and artillery pounded targets along the coastal enclave, sending thick plumes of black smoke rising into the sky, according to Reuters. The Islamic Jihad group said one of its field commanders was killed by tank fire near the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, the Associated Press reported. Explosions could be heard in Gaza City and there were reports of renewed shelling in eastern Gaza, according to AFP. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev wrote on Twitter: &quot;Hamas again rejects a UN humanitarian ceasefire, Hamas responsible for the continuation of the fighting and the bloodshed.&quot; Earlier Hamas, which rules Gaza, had said it would not countenance any ceasefire in which the IDF maintained a presence in Gaza and continued to destroy its strategic assets. Israel had said its forces would remain in Gaza to search for and destroy cross-border tunnels, the principal aim of the ground operation which began 10 days ago. The confusing sequence of unilateral humanitarian ceasefires followed US secretary of state John Kerry&apos;s return to Washington on Saturday after failing to broker a long-term truce. The US, France, Britain, Italy, Germany, Turkey and Qatar called for an extension to the temporary ceasefire after a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris. Following the meeting, the UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: &quot;The necessity right now is to stop the loss of life. And we stop the loss of life by getting this ceasefire to roll over for 12 hours, 24 hours or 48 hours \u2013 and then again until we have established the level of confidence that allows the parties to sit around a table to talk about the substantive issues.&quot; The death toll in Gaza exceeded 1,000 on Saturday as around 150 bodies were pulled from rubble during the lull in bombing. Thousands of Gazans ventured out from homes and shelters for the first time in days to find that whole streets and neighbourhoods had been destroyed in the past week after Israel and Hamas both agreed to a UN request to cease military activity from 8am until 8pm. Scenes of devastation were discovered by those who returned to areas that had been the centre of particularly intense fighting. Shortly before the ceasefire, at least 16 members of one family, including several children, had been killed in an air strike in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip. The family had recently fled there to escape fighting in a nearby village, according to a Palestinian health official. Around 5,000 people took part in a protest against the war in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, with a heavy police presence to deter rightwing extremists who abused and attacked the demonstrators. In London, tens of thousands of people protested against Israel&apos;s military campaign, making clear their anger outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London, before marching on to Westminster. Condemnation of both Israel and Hamas has intensified. Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw described Israel&apos;s actions as amoral and deeply damaging to its own cause. &quot;It is time for Israel to stop,&quot; he told the Observer. &quot;Both because what it is doing is abjectly amoral but also in terms of its own self-preservation. Its actions are doing incremental damage to everything Israel is supposed to stand for.&quot; Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said the Israelis were using sophisticated weaponry against innocent civilians when they could have deployed them in a more targeted way to limit loss of life. But another former foreign secretary, the Tory MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind, refused to single out Israel, saying both sides must agree an unconditional ceasefire. &quot;I would like to see that, but it can&apos;t be observed by one side alone,&quot; he said. Kerry had expressed confidence on Friday that there was a framework for a ceasefire agreement which could ultimately succeed, saying &quot;serious progress&quot; had been made, although he admitted there was more work to do. He has led international efforts to reach a truce along with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, while keeping in regular contact with the Turkish and Qatari foreign ministers, who have been acting as interlocutors with Hamas. But there were also signals that if the ceasefire ended, the fighting could intensify. Israel&apos;s defence minister, Moshe Ya&apos;alon, said: &quot;At the end of the operation, Hamas will have to think very hard if it is worth it to taunt us in the future. You need to be ready for the possibility that very soon we will order the military to significantly broaden ground activity in Gaza.&quot; The violence has spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent days. Nine Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded as protests over the bloodshed in Gaza have erupted into clashes with Israeli security forces. The Palestine Liberation Organisation called for more demonstrations in the West Bank and said it was helping to try to secure a ceasefire deal. At least 6,000 Palestinians have been injured in the war. The UN said more than 160,000 people had sought shelter in its buildings, with thousands more fleeing their homes to stay with relatives and friends in seemingly safer areas.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T14:26:00Z", "title": "Hamas announces ceasefire as Israeli military resumes Gaza operations", "sentences": ["Around 5,000 people took part in a protest against the war in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, with a heavy police presence to deter rightwing extremists who abused and attacked the demonstrators."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/israeli-military-resumes-gaza-operations"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news"], "article": "The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has accused Hamas of \u201cviolating its own ceasefire\u201d in the Gaza conflict.

On CNN, he said: \u201cHamas is betting on this. Hamas is betting on the fact that people do not have the context, that they can hoodwink people and mislead the world.\u201d He accused Hamas of deliberately basing its military operations in schools, hospitals, homes and mosques in Gaza and said that when Israel warned civilians to get out of the way of Israel\u2019s return fire, Hamas made them stay as human shields. \u201cThey want to pile up more and more dead bodies of Palestinian civilians. Hamas is responsible for that, Hamas should be held accountable for civilian deaths,\u201d he said. Speaking to CBS, Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel might lose the propaganda war but said his country&apos;s security had to outweigh such concerns.      Smoke from Israeli strikes rises over Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip. Photograph: Adel Hana/AP    Both sides in the conflict appeared to be looking to the possibility of new peace talks in Cairo, brokered by Egypt, which Netanyahu told NBC were \u201cthe only game in town\u201d. But the Palestinian authorities accused Netanyahu of having a \u201chidden agenda\u201d to destroy any conciliation. Mohammad Shtayyeh, an adviser to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who spoke to CNN, said a delegation was being assembled to go to Cairo. He said interventions by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, had been helpful, but with 80% of casualties in Gaza being civilians, it was Israel which was ratcheting up tension, not Hamas. \u201cThese people have nowhere to go,\u201d Shtayyeh said of the residents of Gaza, one of the most densely populated strips of land in the world. Shtayyeh called on Israel to end its \u201csiege\u201d of Gaza and the \u201cmisery\u201d of the Palestinians there. Gaza has been the subject of an Israeli blockade for the past seven years. He said President Abbas had \u201ccome to terms with Hamas, that they are accepting a two-state solution and they are for long-term quietness\u201d and added: \u201cWe are designing a conciliation [agreement] on our terms, not Hamas\u2019s terms.\u201d Netanyahu said he wanted two parts to a solution that went hand in hand \u2013 security for Israel and social and economic relief for the Palestinians that went to the people and not to Hamas, \u201cto build tunnels that come up under our cities and explode our children\u201d.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T16:06:57Z", "title": "Israel PM Netanyahu tells US talkshows Hamas violated own ceasefire", "sentences": ["It\u2019s continuing to fire at us as we speak,\u201d he told CNN, from Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/israel-pm-netanyahu-tells-us-talkshows-hamas-violated-own-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["Hacking", "Technology", "Data and computer security", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Israel", "China", "World news"], "article": "A Chinese hacking group has been accused of stealing data from Israel\u2019s billion-dollar Iron Dome missile system. The state-sponsored Comment Crew hacking group, thought to operate out of China, was responsible for attacks from 2011 onwards on three Israeli defence technology companies Elisra Group, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems (Rads) all involved with the Iron Dome project. The Iron Dome is Israel\u2019s advanced anti-missile defence system \u2013 part funded to the tune of $1bn by the US government. It fires missiles to intercept rockets and artillery shells fired from between 2.5 miles and 43 miles away into populated areas, commonly described as a missile shield. The revelation comes as cyber attacks against Israel have intensified during its current conflict with Palestine, including recent attacks defacing Israel Railways and hospital websites and denial of service attacks which slow Israeli\u2019s internet connections, according to Dina Beer, managing director of the Israeli Internet Association, talking to Bloomberg. \u2018We transferred this technology to them, and they coughed it all up\u2019 The hacks occurred between 10 October 2011 and 13 August 2012, according to security firm Cyber Engineering Services (CES), talking to independent security researcher Brian Krebs, which tapped into the secret communications of the hackers and discovered that they had stolen over 700 files from IAI. CES said that the majority of the data was intellectual property and that the 700 files likely represented only a small proportion of the data stolen from the three defence companies. Among the documents stolen from IAI were detailed schematics and specifications for the US-designed Arrow 3 missile, which is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and a key component of Iron Dome, as well as drones and other rockets. \u201cMost of the technology in the Arrow 3 wasn\u2019t designed by Israel, but by Boeing and other US defence contractors,\u201d Joseph Drissel, founder and chief executive of US-based CES, told Krebs. \u201cWe transferred this technology to them, and they coughed it all up. In the process, they essentially gave up a bunch of stuff that\u2019s probably being used in our systems as well.\u201d \u2018The information was reported to the appropriate authorities\u2019 The hackers had access to the corporate networks to some of the Israeli defence companies for over a year, and stole confidential emails from top executives at the companies. An IAI spokeswoman brushed off the hacking allegations as \u201cold news\u201d. \u201cAt the time, the issue was treated as required by the applicable rules and procedures,\u201d IAI\u2019s Eliana Fishler told Krebs. \u201cThe information was reported to the appropriate authorities. IAI undertook corrective actions in order to prevent such incidents in the future.\u201d Meanwhile Rafael Advanced Defense Systems denied knowledge of the attacks. \u201cRafael does not recall such an incident,\u201d said Amit Zimmer, corporate spokesperson for Rads told the Guardian. \u201cRafael\u2019s data bases, including its air defence data bases, are extremely well protected to the highest standards.\u201d \u201cThe real victims here are the people on the other end who are put in harm\u2019s way because of poor posture on security and the lack of urgency coming from a lot of folks on how to fix this problem,\u201d said Drissel. \u201cSo many companies have become accustomed to low-budget IT costs. But the reality is that if you have certain sensitive information, you\u2019ve got to spend a certain amount of money to secure it.\u201d The CES report on the attacks has not yet been publicly released, but the Comment Crew is thought to be associated with the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), which was accused of stealing large amounts of data from US defence companies. People\u2019s Liberation Army Unit 61398 Security firm Mandiant identified the Comment Crew as PLA unit 61398 in February 2013, while the United States Department of Justice charged five members of the hacking group with various cybercrime and espionage offences in May. China is not the only country attacking Israeli through cyber channels. Israel counted 44m attacks on government sites during Israel\u2019s eight-day conflict with Hamas in 2012, with the majority originating from Palestinian territory. \u2018It\u2019s terrorism, designed mostly to frighten\u2019 Social media feeds and websites of news organisations have also been hit, including a TV channel that was hacked to display a Hebrew message in July urging Israeli mothers to call their sons home from the country\u2019s military or see them killed or captured. Domino\u2019s Israel had its Facebook page taken over by hackers posting messages, including one that stated that, \u201ctoday will strike deep in Israel, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Ashkelon, Ashdod more than 2000 rockets. We\u2019ll start at 7. Counting back towards the end of Israel \u2026 Be warned!\u201d \u201cThe attacks aren\u2019t sophisticated; they just give the feeling that someone else is in control,\u201d said Beer. \u201cIt\u2019s terrorism, designed mostly to frighten: \u2018See, we can control your sites and do things you don\u2019t want us to do.\u2019 And it works.\u201d IAI further denied the hack and theft of data. \u201cThe information reported regarding the leakage of sensitive information is incorrect,\u201d said a Eliana Fishler, senior vice president for communications at IAI in a statement sent to the Guardian. \u201cThe publications refer to an attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s civilian non-classified Internet network which allegedly occurred several years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIAI\u2019s cyber security systems operate in accordance with the most rigorous requirements and also in this case they were proven to be effective.\u201d Elisra Group had not responded to comment at the time of publication. \u2022 This article was updated on 30 July 2014 to include a further statement from IAI.

The reports, which the Obama administration said were based on \u201cshocking and disappointing\u201d fabrications that did not bear \u201cany resemblance to reality\u201d, came after US officials fiercely rejected a series of other slurs directed against the US secretary of state, John Kerry, which have also appeared in the Israeli media in recent days. Both sets of reports were attributed to anonymous sources and suggest a concerted campaign against Washington, which has expressed rising concern over civilian deaths in the Gaza conflict and is pressing Israel to adopt an immediate, unilateral humanitarian ceasefire. The report claimed to have access to a leaked portion of transcript of Obama\u2019s call with Netanyahu, which took place on on Sunday; it was aired on Tuesday evening in Israel on Channel One, a respected TV outlet. It quoted a \u201csenior American source\u201d and, showing excerpts of the supposed transcript, said that Obama had been and hostile and impatient with Israel\u2019s prime minister. Just over an hour later, White House officials released a flurry of a strongly-worded statements rebutting the reports. \u201cWe have seen these reports, and neither the reports nor the alleged transcript bear any resemblance to reality,\u201d said Bernadette Meehan, a national security council spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and disappointing that someone would sink to misrepresenting a private conversation between the president and the prime minister in fabrications to the Israeli press.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser at the White House, said the transcript was \u201ctotally false\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office also confirmed the transcript was fake.     Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, centre, in Tel Aviv. His office also discredited the reports. Photograph: Jini/Xinhua Press/Corbis    By then the reports had been widely disseminated, in Israel as elsewhere, as indicating \u2013 incorrectly, as it turned out \u2013 that Obama had been taking a tough and condescending position in private with Israel, demanding it cease its military activities. Even before the false reports about the Obama-Netanyahu call were broadcast, the US and Israel were seeking to heal a pre-existing diplomatic rift over the fallout of Kerry\u2019s failed attempt to broker a ceasefire to the conflict, that has claimed more than 1,100 Palestinian lives, many of them civilians. That dispute revolved around leaks in the Israeli media about Kerry\u2019s diplomatic efforts in the region, which the US officials complained has mischaracterised his discussions with Israeli counterpart and contained unfair and personal barbs. One report, citing very senior officials in Jerusalem, described Kerry\u2019s diplomatic efforts as a \u201cstrategic terrorist attack\u201d. In Washington on Tuesday, Kerry dismissed the criticism. \u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about the personal attacks,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve taken hits before in politics. I\u2019m not worried about that. This is not about me.\u201d Israel is widely believed to have resisted Kerry\u2019s intervention in the Middle East from the start, and despite repeated public assurances from both sides that relations between the two allies are undamaged, there are indications that tensions remain appear high and may be increasing. Those fissures were hinted at by Kerry during his remarks to reporters, when he said that Netanyahu had asked him to attempt to broker a temporary humanitarian ceasefire. Reports in Israel suggested the prime minister\u2019s office disputed that account of the call, indicating it was Kerry \u2013 not Netanyahu \u2013 who broached the topic of the pause in fighting. Kerry, however, directly tied the discussion of the ceasefire to Netanyahu, providing reporters with a surprisingly detailed summary of the call. \u201cPrime minister Netanyahu himself said to me, \u2018Can you try to get a humanitarian ceasefire for this period of time?\u2019\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAnd if it weren\u2019t for his commitment to it, obviously the president of the United States and I would not be trying to make this effort.\u201d Pointedly, Kerry added: \u201cNow, I take this commitment at face value or someone is playing a different game here, and I hope that\u2019s not the fact.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-07-29T20:56:20Z", "title": "White House: Israeli reports of Obama-Netanyahu tensions are 'totally false'", "sentences": ["Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, centre, in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/obama-netanyahu-call-tensions-denounce-us-israel"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "At least 15 Palestinians were killed and about 90 injured early on Wednesday when a UN school sheltering displaced people was hit by shells during a second night of relentless bombardment that followed an Israeli warning of a protracted military campaign. Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner-general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, condemned \u201cin in the strongest possible terms this serious violation of international law by Israeli forces\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cLast night, children were killed as they slept next to their parents on the floor of a classroom in a UN-designated shelter in Gaza. Children killed in their sleep; this is an affront to all of us, a source of universal shame. Today the world stands disgraced. \u201cWe have visited the site and gathered evidence. We have analysed fragments, examined craters and other damage. Our initial assessment is that it was Israeli artillery that hit our school, in which 3,300 people had sought refuge. We believe there were at least three impacts.  \u201cIt is too early to give a confirmed official death toll. But we know that there were multiple civilian deaths and injuries including of women and children and the UNRWA guard who was trying to protect the site. These are people who were instructed to leave their homes by the Israeli army.\u201d It was the sixth time that UNRWA schools had been struck, he added. \u201cOur staff, the very people leading the humanitarian response are being killed. Our shelters are overflowing. Tens of thousands may soon be stranded in the streets of Gaza, without food, water and shelter if attacks on these areas continue.\u201d At the school, Assad Sabah said he and his five children were huddling under desks in one of the classrooms because of the constant sound of tank fire throughout the night. \u201cWe were scared to death,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cAfter 4.30am, tanks started firing more. Three explosions shook the school. One classroom collapsed over the head of the people who were inside.\u201d A spokeswoman from the Israel Defence Forces said that its initial inquiries showed that \u201cHamas militants fired mortar shells from the vicinity of the school, and [Israeli] soldiers responded by firing towards the origins of the fire\u201d. An investigation was continuing, she added. A UN source said there was no evidence of militant activity inside the school. The shelling of the school came as diplomatic attention was focussed on Cairo, where a delegation including the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the main militant factions in Gaza, was due to take part in ceasefire talks. A key issue was whether the Gaza-based factions and their armed wings accepted the authority of the delegation. The Israeli security cabinet was also due to meet on Wednesday afternoon and would consider any progress made in Cairo. Israel\u2019s political and military leaders face crucial decisions on whether to press deeper into Gaza once the cross-border tunnels have been located and destroyed, or whether to accept a \u201cquiet for quiet\u201d deal. \u201cThe next 24-72 hours will be critical,\u201d said a diplomatic source. The last two nights have seen the most fierce bombardment in this Gaza offensive, with inense air strikes, tank shelling and bombardment from Israeli gunboats. In 23 days more than 1,240 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed. On the Israeli side 53 soldiers and three civilians have been killed. The shelling of the UN school followed an incident last week when another UN school in Beit Hanoun was hit as the playground was filled with families awaiting evacuation amid heavy fighting. Israel denied it was responsible for the deaths, saying a single \u201cerrant\u201d shell fired by its forces hit the school playground, which was empty at the time.     Aftermath of the strike on a UN school in Gaza City. Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images    But according to testimonies gathered by UN staff, an initial shell was followed by \u201cseveral others in the close vicinity of the school within a matter of minutes\u201d, spokesman Chris Gunness said. Reporters who visited the scene minutes afterwards said damage and debris was consistent with mortar rounds. UNRWA, said on Tuesday it had found a cache of rockets at one of its schools in Gaza and deplored those who had put them there for placing civilians in harm\u2019s way. \u201cThis is yet another flagrant violation of the neutrality of our premises. We call on all the warring parties to respect the inviolability of UN property,\u201d Gunness said. Two similar discoveries were made last week. Israel says militants from Hamas and other organisations launch rockets from the vicinity of UNRWA properties. More than 200,000 people in Gaza have taken shelter in the UN\u2019s schools and properties after Israel warned them to leave whole neighbourhoods that it was planning to bomb. UNRWA said it was at \u201cbreaking point\u201d. The Israeli military said it had targeted more than 4,000 sites in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 8 July. It had detonated three tunnels in Gaza in the past 24 hours, it added. Among the overnight targets were five mosques, which the IDF said housed tunnel shafts, weapons stores and lookout posts, and two \u201cfacilities\u201d utilised by senior Hamas militants. International pressure for an end to the bloodshed has continued to mount. On Tuesday the British prime minister, David Cameron, added his weight to calls for an unconditional, immediate humanitarian ceasefire. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is absolutely heartbreaking in terms of the loss of life \u2026 everyone wants to see this stopped,\u201d he said. Blaming Hamas for triggering the conflict, he added: \u201cHamas must stop attacking Israel with rocket attacks. That is how this started. It\u2019s completely unjustified and they need to stop as part of the ceasefire.\u201d Four Latin American countries \u2013 Chile, Peru, Brazil and El Salvador \u2013 recalled their ambassadors to Israel. \u201cChile observes with great concern and discouragement that the military operations \u2013 which at this point appear to be a collective punishment to the Palestinian civil population in Gaza \u2013 don\u2019t respect fundamental norms of international humanitarian law,\u201d its foreign ministry said. But support for the military operation among the Israeli public remained solid. A poll published by Tel Aviv university on Tuesday found 95% of Israeli Jews felt the offensive was justified. Only 4% believed too much force had been used.   Gaza conflict timeline   Hamas released a video showing fighters inside tunnels in Gaza and containing a voice message from Mohammed Deif, the leader of its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. \u201cThe occupying entity will not enjoy security unless our people live in freedom and dignity,\u201d Deif said. \u201cThere will be no ceasefire before the [Israeli] aggression is stopped and the blockade is lifted. We will not accept interim solutions.\u201d On Tuesday flames and clouds of black smoke billowed over Gaza\u2019s only power plant after it was destroyed. \u201cThe power plant is finished,\u201d said its director, Mohammed al-Sharif, signalling a new crisis for Gaza\u2019s 1.8 million people, who were already enduring power cuts of more than 20 hours a day. Amnesty International said the crippling of the power station amounted to \u201ccollective punishment of Palestinians\u201d. The strike on the plant will worsen already severe problems with Gaza\u2019s water supply, sewage treatment and power supplies to medical facilities. \u201cWe need at least one year to repair the power plant, the turbines, the fuel tanks and the control room,\u201d said Fathi Sheik Khalil of the Gaza energy authority. \u201cEverything was burned.\u201d He said crew members were trapped by the fire for several hours before they were able to be evacuated. Gaza City officials said damage to the power station could paralyse pumps and urged residents to ration water. The home of the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, was destroyed on Tuesday and a building used by Hamas-controlled broadcast outlets was damaged. Haniyeh was not at home when a missile struck shortly before dawn; most of Hamas\u2019s senior leaders are presumed to be residing in underground bunkers for the duration of the war. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said he was in discussions with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to find an end to the fighting in Gaza. The pair had spoken \u201ctwo, three, four times a day in recent days\u201d, Kerry told reporters in Washington. They were working \u201cvery carefully and thoughtfully\u201d on ways to \u201cprevent this spiralling downwards\u201d, he said. Kerry reiterated US support for Israel\u2019s right to self-defence, \u201cto live free from rockets and tunnels\u201d. The secretary of state has come under sustained attack in Israel over what was perceived as undue sympathy for Hamas\u2019s position in ceasefire negotiations in the Middle East and Paris last week.

The telegraph and telephone lines were cut.\u201d  1917 - The Russian Revolution How the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace  \u201cThe Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik armed mob, as though by a horde of barbarians.

The absence of trains and trams is not a new thing; it was borne good humouredly, and in no part of the country did any kind of serious disturbance occur. Already, by the second day, there have been ominous signs that this peaceful state of affairs is gradually giving way to a more dangerous temper.\u201d  1927 - Lindbergh flies the Ocean, solo Alone across the Atlantic  \u201cCaptain Lindbergh, the young United States airman, reached Paris at 10.22 on Saturday night on his non-stop flight from New York.

The truth is that this camp is in no sense a model, although it is no worse than many of the Hitlerite concentration camps. The total number of prisoners who have been killed or who have died of their injuries at Dachau cannot be far short of fifty.\u201d  1935 - Fascist expansionism begins Fascist troops march into Ethiopia  \u201cMussolini\u2019s Fascist troops marched into Ethiopia today - and as the war-drums called Emperor Haile Selassie\u2019s people to fight, the League of Nations in Geneva was facing its greatest test since it was formed in 1919.\u201d  1936 - Franco\u2019s rebellion in Spain Civil war in Spain  \u201cOn July 12 Calvo Sotelo was taken from his house by night and shot. There is some mystery in this assassination.\u201d  1937 - The Middle Eastern question Partition of Palestine  \u201cPartition of Palestine between Arabs and Jews and the termination of the mandate are recommended by the Royal Commission, whose unanimous report is published to-day.\u201d  1938 - \u201cPeace for our time\u201d? Return from Munich  \u201cMr. Chamberlain went to a first-floor window and leaned forward happily smiling on the people. \u2018My good friends,\u2019 he said - it took some time to still the clamour so that he might be heard - \u2018this is the second time in our history that there has come back from Germany \u2018peace with honour.\u2019 I believe it is peace for our time.\u2019\u201d  1939 - The declaration of war Britain at war with Germany  \u201cBritain and France are now at war with Germany.

No one imagines that the supreme battle which began on the beaches of of Normandy early this morning will be won by the Allies without bitter fighting against a determined and desperate enemy, but there is a general sense that the \u2018first hurdles\u2019 of invasion of the European Continent have been successfully surmounted.\u201d  1945 - The atomic bomb Destruction at Hiroshima  \u201cOne hundred thousand Japanese may have been killed or wounded by the single atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This was the unofficial estimate at Guam to-night after reports of the tremendous devastation wrought had come in.\u201d  1946 - The Iron Curtain descends The Cold War  \u201cIn Czechoslovakia life is normal. This does not seem so surprising if you go from London to Prague by air, travelling more easily and more quickly, than from London to Edinburgh. It is incredible and bewildering if you come to Prague overland through the chaos and starvation of any of the surrounding countries.\u201d  1947 - Independence for India and Pakistan India and Pakistan celebrate  \u201cBritish rule in India ended at midnight last night after 163 years. To-day the new Dominions of India and Pakistan are in being.

Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    1950 - TV viewing habits Television tastes  \u201cOwners of television sets seldom switch off even programmes which they admit to disliking, so that the extent to which television is watched seems to depend only to a limited extent upon the nature of the programme transmitted, said Mr Robert Silvey, head of Audience Research, B.B.C., when he addressed the Manchester Statistical Society last night on methods of viewer research employed by the corporation.\u201d  1951 - Theft and return of the Stone of Destiny Return of the Stone  \u201cThree and a half months after its removal from the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey early on Christmas morning, the Stone of Scone was to-day deposited in Arbroath Abbey in Scotland.

In 365 days\u2019 time, Independent Television will have been with us for a year. So far, it has been with us for a bare hand-count of hours, and although the conclusions are crying to be jumped to, the temptation to jump must be resisted.\u201d  1956 - The Hungarian rising Soviet tanks crush resistance  \u201cAt 8 p.m. yesterday the Soviet High Command in Hungary ordered Mr Nagy\u2019s Government to surrender by noon \u201cor Budapest will be bombed.\u201d Soviet armoured forces then went into action.\u201d  1957 - Little Rock Heavier guard for negroes  \u201cAbout 75 white pupils walked out of the Central High School in Little Rock after eight Negroes went in to-day, and one boy hung a straw effigy of a Negro from a tree.\u201d  1958 - Music in stereo Stereophonic sound  \u201cWithin a few months, so we are promised by the big record companies, stereophonic discs will be available in this country.

At least 15 people, mostly children and women, died when the school in Jabaliya refugee camp was hit by five shells during a night of relentless bombardment across Gaza. More than 100 people were injured. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said the attack was &quot;outrageous and unjustifiable&quot; and demanded &quot;accountability and justice&quot;. The UN said its officials had repeatedly given details of the school and its refugee population to Israel.

Photograph: Khalil Hamra/AP    Fighting in Gaza continued through the day despite a four-hour humanitarian ceasefire called by Israel from 3pm. A crowded market in Shujai&apos;iya was hit in the late afternoon, causing at least 17 deaths, including a journalist, and injuring about 200 people, according to Gaza health officials. They said people had ventured out to shop in the belief a ceasefire was in place. Witnesses said several shells struck as people were running away. Israel said rockets and mortar shells continued to be fired from Gaza. Israel on Thursday was showing no sign of scaling back Operation Protective Edge, with the military reportedly calling up an additional 16,000 reserves as the offensive entered its 24th day.  At the UN school the first shell came just after the early morning call to prayer, when most of those taking shelter were asleep, crammed into classrooms with what few possessions they had managed to snatch as they fled their homes. About 3,300 people had squashed into Jabaliya Elementary A&amp;B Girls&apos; School since the Israeli military warned people to leave their homes and neighbourhoods or risk death under intense bombardment. Classroom number one, near the school&apos;s entrance, had become home to about 40 people, mostly women and children. As a shell blasted through the wall, showering occupants with shrapnel and spattering blood on walls and floors, Amna Zantit, 31, scrambled to gather up her three terrified infants in a panicked bid for the relative safety of the schoolyard. &quot;Everyone was trying to escape,&quot; she said, clutching her eight-month old baby tightly. Minutes later, a second shell slammed through the roof of the two-storey school. At least 15 people were killed and more than 100 injured. Most were women or children. Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, commissioner-general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said the shelling of the school was a &quot;serious violation of international law by Israeli forces&quot;. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl said: &quot;Last night, children were killed as they slept next to their parents on the floor of a classroom in a UN-designated shelter in Gaza. Children killed in their sleep; this is an affront to all of us, a source of universal shame. Today the world stands disgraced.&quot; Khalil al-Halabi, the UN official in charge of the schools in the area, was quickly on the scene. Bodies were littered over the classroom, and the badly injured lay in pools of blood amid the debris and rubble caused by the blast. &quot;I was shaking,&quot; he said. &quot;It was very, very hard for me to see the blood and hear the children crying.&quot; By daylight, the detritus of people&apos;s lives was visible among ruins of the classroom: a ball, a bucket, some blankets, tins of food, a pair of flip-flops. The corpses of donkeys, used to haul the meagre possessions of refugees to what they thought was safety, lay at the school&apos;s entrance as two lads wearing Palestinian boy scout scarves collected human body parts for burial. Five of the injured were in a critical condition in hospital.     A Palestinian collects body parts in a classroom at the Abu Hussein UN school. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    Halabi was facing impossible requests for advice from those who escaped the carnage. &quot;These people are very angry. They evacuated their homes and came here for protection, not to be killed inside a UN shelter. Now they are asking me whether to stay or leave. They are very frightened. They don&apos;t know what to do.&quot; The attack on the school was the sixth time that UNRWA premises have been hit since the war in Gaza began more than three weeks ago, the UN said. Palestinians fled their homes after Israel warned that failure to do so would put their lives at risk. Those at the Jabaliya school were among more than 200,000 who have sought shelter at UN premises in the belief that families would be safe. Analysis of evidence gathered at the site by UNRWA led to an initial assessment that Israeli artillery had hit the school, causing &quot;multiple civilian deaths and injuries including of women and children and the UNRWA guard who was trying to protect the site. These are people who were instructed to leave their homes by the Israeli army.&quot; Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl added: &quot;Our staff, the very people leading the humanitarian response, are being killed. Our shelters are overflowing. Tens of thousands may soon be stranded in the streets of Gaza, without food, water and shelter if attacks on these areas continue.&quot; The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was investigating the incident at the UN school. Initial inquiries showed that &quot;Hamas militants fired mortar shells from the vicinity of the school, and [Israeli] soldiers responded by firing towards the origins of the fire&quot;, a spokeswoman said. A UN source said there was no evidence of militant activity inside the school. The US, which has been at odds with Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, over efforts to secure a ceasefire, condemned the school shelling but did not specifically blame Israel. The incident comes after an explosion at another UN school in Beit Hanoun last week as the playground was filled with families awaiting evacuation. Israel denied responsibility for the deaths, saying a single &quot;errant&quot; shell fired by its forces hit the school playground, which was empty at the time.     A damaged classroom of the school. Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPA    UNRWA has rejected the IDF&apos;s account, saying an initial shell was followed by several others within minutes. Reporters who visited the school shortly afterwards said damage and debris was consistent with mortar rounds. UNRWA has found rockets at three of its schools in Gaza in the past three weeks, which it has swiftly condemned as &quot;flagrant violation[s] of the neutrality of our premises&quot;. Israel says militants from Hamas and other organisations launch rockets from the vicinity of UNRWA properties. The Israeli military said it had targeted more than 4,100 sites in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 8 July. The death toll in Gaza rose above 1,300 on Wednesday. Three soldiers were killed in fighting around Khan Younis, bringing the total IDF death toll to 56. Three civilians have died in rocket attacks on Israel. In an emotional statement, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the &quot;destructive cycle of violence has caused untold suffering&quot;. He said: &quot;You can&apos;t look at the pictures coming from Gaza and Israel without your heart breaking. We must cry to God and beat down the doors of heaven and pray for peace and justice and security. Only a costly and open-hearted seeking of peace between Israeli and Palestinian can protect innocent people, their children and grandchildren, from ever worse violence.&quot; He called for a renewed &quot;commitment to political dialogue in the wider search for peace and security for both Israeli and Palestinians&quot;.

A survey conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University on three separate occasions between 14 and 23 July, and published this week, found that only 3-4% agreed with a statement that the Israel Defence Forces had used excessive firepower in the conflict. The findings were echoed in a separate poll, also published this week, in which 86% of Israeli Jews said they supported the war. Fewer than 10% agreed that it was time to stop, and 86.5% said military action should not cease until Hamas&apos;s rockets and tunnels had been dealt with and Hamas had surrendered. Support is not universal, however. There have been anti-war rallies in most major cities, but they have attracted small numbers and have come under physical and verbal attack from rightwing activists. A protest in Tel Aviv last Saturday drew around 5,000, the biggest number to date by far. Tamar Hermann, of the Israel Democracy Institute, said she was not surprised by the strength of support. &quot;The majority of Israeli Jewish public see an existential threat in the rockets and tunnels,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no pressure on people \u2013 this is authentic support. People think this is a just war.&quot; Isaac Herzog, leader of the Labour party, said Israel was hardly a North Korea-style monolith. &quot;Any issue in Israel is up for argument and debate, and the social networks are extremely active,&quot; he said. &quot;But there is a national consensus [on the war].&quot; That consensus has been shaped in part by the media, which have largely focused on Israeli military casualties and rocket attacks, playing down Palestinian civilian deaths. &quot;The Israeli media is completely one-sided,&quot; said Orly Halpern, an Israeli journalist who writes the News Nosh, a daily review of the media for Americans For Peace Now. &quot;You find references to Palestinian civilian casualties only deep in reports or on inside pages.&quot; None of Israel&apos;s tabloid papers carried front-page reports of Wednesday&apos;s deadly attacks in Gaza \u2013 the shelling of a UN school sheltering refugees, and the bombing of a crowded market. The lead of the inside-page story in Israel&apos;s biggest-selling paper, Yedioth Ahronoth, read &quot;Palestinian civilians continue to pay the price for Hamas aggression&quot;. Halpern said: &quot;Even when Palestinian civilian casualties are mentioned, it&apos;s portrayed as Hamas&apos;s fault.&quot; A notable exception is the left-leaning Haaretz, which carries reports of events in Gaza and commentary critical of the military operation. Its share of the market was less than 7% last year. Israeli journalists have been forbidden from entering Gaza since 2008, which inevitably hinders reporting. There have been several cases in recent weeks of workers being sacked or suspended for comments posted on Facebook and Twitter. A supermarket employee was fired for expressing joy over the death of Israeli soldiers. A bank employee was sacked after writing grossly antisemitic remarks on Facebook. Some activists who have posted anti-war opinions, rather than outrageously offensive material, have complained of being vilified. &quot;The strength of a democratic state lies in its enabling of free expression,&quot; said Sharon Abraham-Weiss, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. &quot;Free speech protections are designed specifically to cover outrageous and frustrating comments, from the left and the right.

The questions were given new urgency after a UN-run school was hit by five artillery shells on Wednesday, killing 16 civilians and injuring 100 more, mostly women and children, and the deaths of 17 others in a crowded market, as the Israel Defence Forces&apos; (IDF) Operation Protective Edge against Hamas entered its 24th day. The IDF has repeatedly cited targeting errors, and blamed Hamas for operating in civilian areas. However, Andrew Exum, a former US army officer who has studied Israel&apos;s military campaigns, said the IDF had a long history of mistakes causing many civilian casualties. &quot;Errant artillery and air strikes have unfortunately been something of a theme in Israel&apos;s conflicts in both southern Lebanon and Gaza over the past two decades. There are good strategic reasons to avoid using air power and artillery in these conflicts: they tend to be pretty indiscriminate in their effects and make it difficult for the population under fire to figure out what they&apos;re supposed to do to be safe,&quot; said Exum, who was a defence department special adviser on the Middle East. &quot;I&apos;m not sure what the issue is. In 2006 and 2008, it was pretty clear the IDF&apos;s combined armed skills \u2013 their ability to integrate artillery and air power into ground campaigns \u2013 had atrophied since the withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. But I don&apos;t know whether the issue remains poor training, a lack of forward observers talking to the artillery batteries and aircraft, or commanders who just don&apos;t think avoiding civilian casualties is a priority.&quot; &quot;When a stray shell killed 23 Palestinian civilians, including nine children, in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza in November 2006, it was found it was caused by a faulty programming card in a counter-battery radar system, called Shilem, designed to track an enemy projectile&apos;s trajectory back to its point of origin and direct artillery fire back at that spot. The inquiry also found that the artillery crew had not recalibrated their weapons overnight and did not have spotters monitoring whether their fire was accurate, so 12 to 15 artillery shells were fired before it was realised they were hitting an apartment complex. It is not clear what changes the IDF made to its targeting methods as a result.&quot; Retired brigadier general Shlomo Brom insisted there was no inherent problem in IDF training, saying: &quot;The Israeli artillery corps has gone through the same development the Israeli air force has gone through, and most of the ammunition it launches, including shells launched by guns, is accurate guided ammunition, and there is no problem with the training of the crews. &quot;If there are problems of targeting it is probably the product of gaps in intelligence \u2026 and collateral damage that is caused by Hamas&apos;s use of the cover of the civilian population,&quot; said Brom, now a senior research associate at the Institute for National Security Studies, in Tel Aviv. However, military analysts and human rights observers say the IDF is still using unguided, indirect fire with high-explosive shells, which they argue is inappropriate for a densely populated area like Gaza \u2013 where 1.8 million people live in an area the size of the Isle of Wight. The biggest artillery weapon being used is a 155mm howitzer, mounted on tracks to make it mobile. It typically fires a fragmentation shell weighing 44kg that spreads shrapnel over a wide area. Such shells have a lethal radius of 50 to 150 metres and causes injury up to 300 metres from its point of impact. Furthermore, such indirect-fire artillery (meaning it is fired out of direct sight of the target) has a margin of error of 200 to 300 metres. The use of indirect artillery fire in residential areas is not forbidden under international humanitarian law, but its legality depends on a balance between potential military gain against risk of harm to non-combatants. On that basis, Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International&apos;s senior crisis response adviser, said it was hard to see a military justification for its use in Gaza. &quot;The margin of error of an artillery shell is well known. If you are shooting into a civilian area, there is a high chance of hitting civilians and a low chance of hitting your military objective, unless your military objective is to terrorise and punish a population,&quot; she said. The IDF is reported to have a &quot;safety zone&quot;, the closest an artillery target can be to civilians areas, of 100 metres. That is significantly less than the casualty radius of 155mm artillery shells, and Human Rights Watch found in a 2007 report that the rule appeared to be ignored in Gaza. Where howitzers are used to strike back at missiles or mortars launched from inside Gaza, the guns are aimed with the help of the Shilem radar system and a linked, computerised fire direction centre. The coordinates for any protected building \u2013 the UN school for example \u2013 are supposed to have been fed into that computer database to block fire in that direction automatically. The UN says it had provided the coordinates of all its buildings, but it is not clear whether that data was incorporated into IDF systems. The legality of Israel&apos;s indirect fire in response to Hamas&apos;s missiles also depends on the availability of more accurate alternatives. Israel has the option of aerial missile strikes but they are not as instantaneous, in response to enemy fire, as artillery. Tank fire, being direct, within sight of a target, should also be more accurate, but Rovera said there have been plenty of examples of sloppy aiming. &quot;Reckless targeting is a recurring problem, and the hand-wringing and words of regret no longer have any value. If you are making the same mistakes again and again, you would hope something is being learned,&quot; she said, adding there was no sign of any disciplinary action for IDF mistakes that kill civilians. &quot;There is no pattern of anyone being held to account, and impunity just leads to more reckless behaviour.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-31T18:56:18Z", "title": "Gaza civilian death toll raises questions about Israeli military training", "sentences": ["&quot;If there are problems of targeting it is probably the product of gaps in intelligence \u2026 and collateral damage that is caused by Hamas&apos;s use of the cover of the civilian population,&quot; said Brom, now a senior research associate at the Institute for National Security Studies, in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/gaza-civilian-death-toll-military-training-experts"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "For the last few weeks GuardianWitness has been running two assignments \u2013 one for people living in Palestine and the other for those in Israel.

Feeling sick   I was driving home from work earlier tonight, a relatively uneventful day with no sirens, and no running to the bomb shelter.  Actually got some work done. All of a sudden a news alert beeped angrily at me from my phone. I opened it whilst driving (yes I know!) and immediately saw why the beep was so annoyed, delivering the jolting news that Israeli 13 soldiers had died on Saturday. I had to stop tha car and nearly threw up. After a few moments of deep breathing I continued my journey home. Once home I spent some time playing with my two shining lights of hope (my kids) and talking to my wife. A quick trip to the supermarket, a bite to eat and then the evning news. I don&#39;t normally watch the TV but the past few days the news has become almost an obsession. Tonight I was confronted by harrowing images of bodies lying in the street after the latest round of fighting in Gaza. Once again, for the second time this eveing, I struggled to keep the contents of my stomach in situ. The tears I had shed watching the interviews of dead soldiers families, bravely struggling to cope with the visceral grief that was visibly shredding their souls,  where replaced with tears for the citizens of Gaza.I felt sick to the core. I am sick of it. Sick of it all. Sick of the interminable violence. Sick at the thought that my beautiful children face the ugliest of futures. Sick of the hypocrisy of the world&#39;s response to this versus the other horrific ongoing atrocities being perpetrated across the world. Sick of reading about Islam-inspired violence and glorified death.Sick of the Palestinian people being betrayed by their political masters. Sick of our shared peace and prosperity being raped by regional power-broking puppet-masters and sick of your hard-earnt tax Pounds. Dollars and Euros being diverted from the people who most need it to the corrupt bastards who claim to represent the Palestinian people but who are, in reality, just the most ruthless and sociopathic mafia on earth. I&#39;m sick of Jewish racism (directed at Ethiopian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Russian Jews etc etc as well as Arabs and other non-Jews). I&#39;m sick of the two-faced silence of Israeli Arabs, who drive around in their SUVs and BMWs, &quot;doing lunch&quot; and living a far better and incomparably freer life than their families and friends unfortunate enough to be the other side of the fence. In case you hadn&#39;t got the message yet I&#39;m sick of it. Needless pain and suffering on both sides. Needless rounds of pointless charades of peace talks. Enough already. Stop with the settlements. Stop with the continual attempted destruction of Israel. Its time to draw a line. We don&#39;t need Ariel and you don&#39;t need Jerusalem. Really. You can still pray at the Al Aqsa (as long as you aren&#39;t packing a suicide belt). We can still visit the holy sites of Hebron. We can both happily float in the Dead Sea and we can all work with, and for, each other. We can do it. Open your eyes, your minds and hearts.

So much hatred, so much darkness, so much enmity, rage and blind hostility came so close to home. What do I do? I have been in this country, now, for about five years, and I have spent most of this time striving to bring people together, Israelis and Palestinians, to encounter one another, to see each other, to listen and to share. It is, at times, magical work. Each time I stand with a pair of people who have never once in their lives had a conversation with someone from the \u201cother\u201d side, each time I bear witness to those first words, to that first shuddering destabilization of the scaffolding of fear, prejudice, preconception...I can literally feel lives shifting in their orbit. What was all mind, story, label, narrative, considered to be that, other, them...suddenly becomes flesh and blood, a name, you. But in the face of this dark act, perpetrated by members of my own people, carried out in my home, such small births of new lives seem just that\u2014small, tiny, insignificant, drowned in a ocean of darkness, less than a drop in the sea of hatred. So what do I do? Keep on meeting, one-by-one? Keep on gathering, group-by-group? I spoke with my sister last night, just moments before the rockets arrived\u2014just moments before I walked into that same forest and the sirens began to wail, before I saw the flare of the missiles in their attempts to intercept, and before I heard the three vast thuds as the rockets hit their marks, before the earth trembled beneath me. She had called to see how we were doing. She feels differently than I do\u2014about Israel, the conflict, and what might be reasonable for Israel to do under these circumstances. I told her that, just hours before her call, I had been to visit the family of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, to pay my respects, but more importantly to be a warm, openly Jewish body demonstrating, in the face of fear, that this is not who we are. I told her about the visit, and about what had been said against the Israeli government by a member of the Abu Khdeir family. \u201cAre you totally against the Israeli government?\u201d She asked. What ensued was a refreshingly open, honest, constructive conversation. No, I am not against the Israeli government. Although I have a graduate degree in government, over the years I have become less and less political. I am not against the government; I am simply not looking to it to solve this crisis, to heal these wounds. \u201cWell what would do you think they should do in the face of this?\u201d she asked. \u201cShould they just let go of security concerns and try to make peace at any cost?\u201d Of course not. The security, safety and wellbeing of its citizens should be the first and primary responsibility of any government. But I see no reason why, in addition to ensuring and maintaining such security, the Israeli government could not be taking much bolder, clearer steps towards building peace. I see no non-political reasons that they could not be dedicating massive resources towards promoting, teaching and fostering coexistence. Why, other than the fear of political reprisals, they could not boldly say, \u2018this is what we are doing: we are giving over a massive allocation of funds towards projects that will all be oriented towards learning how we can live together peacefully and well. We will be teaching coexistence in schools\u2014Jews will learn Arabic, and Arabs will learn Hebrew. We will bring people together in any way that makes sense. We will support and promote joint-economic ventures; we will promote media that show people a new way is possible. We will do everything within our power to shift our society, and the society of our neighbors and cousins, to demonstrate that peaceful co-existence is possible and that, above and beyond all, that is what we want, that is what we stand for.\u2019 There is no structural reason that this could not happen. The only reason is fear and resistance, resistance which is itself ultimately rooted in fear. There is no reason that, instead of borders and the release of prisoners, the pre-conditions for resuming peace talks can\u2019t be the massive and dedicated education of and experimentation with co-existence. We don\u2019t know how to live together. But the only way we are going to truly bring to a halt the disastrous acts of the minority of people who want hate and fear, who want to drive the other out to the sea, on either side, is to deprive them of oxygen. Their oxygen is the often explicit but more broadly the tacit, indirect support of their communities, schools, families, governments; their oxygen is the context in which they thrive and act. To deprive them of oxygen, we must make it infeasible for their views to sway and encourage. To deprive them of resources, people and energy, more and more of us must know, in our blood and in our bones, that we can actually do this, that we can actually live together without hating each other, and without doing our best to harm one another and deprive the other of basic needs and rights. This, the government is not doing. Neither government. The governments of Israel and Palestine are not depriving these toxic minorities of their oxygen. So I am not against the government, but I see no reason to be for it either. I am, again, simply not looking to the government for hope. Right now, if I was to look to anyone for hope, it would be the people, on both sides. It would be to the hundreds of Israelis who have poured in on buses to Shu\u2019afat to pay their condolences to the Abu Khdeir family. It would be to the parents all across Palestine who felt horror and sadness for the loss of the Jewish parents of Eyal, Naftali and Gilad. It would be to the people who know, in their hearts, that this is not the way, that enough is enough; who know that the killing, and the fear and enmity that underlay it, must stop. It is to those of us who know that we must stop teaching our children to hate, so that, despite their differences, God willing in our backyards we will no longer turn to see children burning children, but laughing and at play.

The human consequences of this operation, added to the bombing of entire areas, hospitals, clinics and schools, are awful. Yuli Novak, a former IDF airforce member, has written a deeply thought and felt article about her times in war (A tonne of shame, 29 July), and the change in Israel between 2002, through Operation Cast Lead (27 December 2008-19 January 2009) and today, when she states the IDF airforce \u201cboasts of having released over 100 one-tonne bombs on Gaza\u201d. This wanton destruction of life and the means of living; the seven-year Israeli blockade of Gaza; the slaughter inflicted by one of the most powerful militaries in the world against a population who have nowhere to go and no place for a safe evacuation; all this and more, far exceeds the horror of the five-year siege of Sarajevo. In the early summer of 1993 I met the chief rabbi of Sarajevo, who was giving relief and obtaining exit permits and transport out of the besieged city for Jewish and non-Jewish Bosnians. In Kosovo in 1998 and then in Macedonia in 1999, I saw the young Israeli Relief Agency volunteers helping the Albanian children who had been driven at gunpoint with their families in their thousands out of Kosovo. When the IDF demands that Palestinians evacuate hospitals and their homes; when the coordinates given by UNRWA to save the children in their schools are followed by the bombing of those schools, the sick and the wounded, the girls, boys and their mothers and the elderly become homeless refugees between the 25 by seven miles of the Gaza Strip. Chris Gunness of UNRWA has stated there are and will be well over 200,000 homeless Palestinians in Gaza. On 26 July, when 6-7,000 Israeli citizens rallied for peace in Tel Aviv, Uri Avnery, founder with his wife Rachel of Gush Shalom, wrote an article entitled Once and For All. Uri emphasised the need to stop the blockade of Gaza, to release the Shalit/ Palestinian prisoners who have all been re-arrested, and for the Israeli government to start talks with the Palestinian Unity government on the basis of the Arab peace initiative of some years ago. The Palestinian unity government includes the PLO and Hamas. Daniel Barenboim, with two official passports, Israel and Palestine, is an example of what can and could be done. Edward Said, the truly heroic Palestinian professor and musician with American citizenship, spent his life for this purpose. Yehudi Menuhin, the superb Israeli violinist, also explained the human point of view through music and eloquent passion to end the cruel conflicts, intolerable suffering and injustice. Years ago I made a pledge. To put children before politics. Children have mothers and grandmothers. The human or humanitarian view is the most difficult to achieve or maintain I believe. In the midst of terrible violence and enduring oppression, all peoples are damaged. I once was told by a Croatian journalist during the war, in 1993, \u201cFuck the children!\u201d. But I have met exhausted children, mothers, teachers and paediatricians in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, in Tel Aviv and in occupied Palestine, in the UNRWA schools. I believe in political solutions not in military solutions, like Uri Avnery in Tel Aviv. I fear for the lives of the Israelis who are rallying for peace every Saturday in Tel Aviv. Who go, like Uri Avnery, to the Palestinian villages to stop shootings and demolitions of homes. Humanitarian agencies have to talk to governments that other governments categorise as \u201cthe bad guys\u201d. Until governments agree to talk to the \u201cbad guys\u201d we can never have justice nor peace nor a future for our children anywhere.Vanessa RedgraveLondon", "publicationDate": "2014-08-01T14:32:21Z", "title": "Put Gaza\u2019s children before politics, says Vanessa Redgrave | @guardianletters", "sentences": ["On 26 July, when 6-7,000 Israeli citizens rallied for peace in Tel Aviv, Uri Avnery, founder with his wife Rachel of Gush Shalom, wrote an article entitled Once and For All.", "But I have met exhausted children, mothers, teachers and paediatricians in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, in Tel Aviv and in occupied Palestine, in the UNRWA schools.", "I believe in political solutions not in military solutions, like Uri Avnery in Tel Aviv.", "I fear for the lives of the Israelis who are rallying for peace every Saturday in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/gaza-pledge-put-children-before-politics"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "     Fighting broke out with renewed ferocity in Gaza on Friday as Israeli forces bombarded the town of Rafah in response to the apparent capture of one of its soldiers by Hamas, after an internationally brokered ceasefire collapsed almost immediately. Peace talks planned in Cairo to take advantage of the truce stalled before they began, as the threat of a new escalation loomed, possibly involving an Israeli ground assault on Rafah in search of Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin. Early on Saturday, the Hamas military wing said in a statement on its website that it is &quot;not aware until this moment of a missing soldier or his whereabouts or the circumstances of his disappearance&quot;. The group said it believes the soldier might have been killed in a clash with Hamas fighters about an hour before the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military declined comment on the statement. The United States and the United Nations supported Israeli accounts that Hamas had taken advantage of the 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire to ambush Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers near the entrance to a tunnel outside Rafah, on the southern end of the Gaza Strip on the Egyptian border, killing two soldiers at the same time as seizing Goldin. Barack Obama said Hamas should be held responsible for the collapse of the ceasefire and demanded that the militant group immediately release Goldin. He insisted the US was doing everything possible to prevent the deaths of Palestinian civilians, which he called &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. Obama strongly condemned the Palestinian side for failing to follow through on a truce which he said ended when militants killed two Israeli soldiers and captured a third &quot;almost minutes after a ceasefire had been announced&quot;. &quot;If they are serious about trying to resolve this situation, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible,&quot; Obama told reporters at the White House. However he struck a pessimistic note about the prospects of piecing together another ceasefire after Friday&apos;s return to violence, an objective he said the US would continue, acknowledging that ceasing hostilities in the current climate would be &quot;challenging&quot;. The US president said: &quot;I think it&apos;s going to be very hard to put a ceasefire back together again if the Israelis and the international community can&apos;t feel confident that Hamas can follow through on a ceasefire commitment.&quot; He said it was &quot;not particularly relevant&quot; whether or not a Hamas leader \u2013 or another militant faction \u2013 ordered the abduction. &quot;The point is when they sign on for a ceasefire they&apos;re claiming to speak for all the Palestinian factions.&quot; Obama reaffirmed his support for Israel&apos;s military attempts to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks and cross-border assaults using tunnels. &quot;At the same time we&apos;ve also been clear that innocent civilians in Gaza, caught in the crossfire, have to weigh on our conscience, and we have to do more to protect them,&quot; he said. The president said it was &quot;hard to reconcile&quot; support for Israel&apos;s self-defence and concern for the death of innocent Palestinians. He added: &quot;I want to see everything possible done to make sure that Palestinian civilians are not being killed. It is heartbreaking to see what is happening.&quot; The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said the Hamas attack was &quot;likely to have very serious consequences for the people of Gaza, Israel and beyond&quot;. Through his spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, Ban said: &quot;Such moves call into question the credibility of Hamas&apos;s assurances to the United Nations.&quot; After the tunnel clash, Israel struck back with heavy artillery fire and an aerial bombardment of Rafah. According to local health authorities, at least 65 Palestinians were killed, many of them children, and more than 350 were wounded. Reports from the town&apos;s al-Najar hospital described bloodied bodies lying on stretchers and across the floor, as family members searched frantically for missing relatives. In 25 days of fighting, more than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed, as well as 63 Israeli soldiers and three Israeli civilians. Several other medical institutions have been forced to close or have been badly damaged during four weeks of war. The bombardment of Rafah appeared to reflect what the IDF called the &quot;Hannibal directive&quot;, in which it responds to any capture of a soldier with heavy fire aimed at stopping the captors leaving the scene, even if it risks injury to the Israeli prisoner. &quot;Israel will take all necessary steps against those who call for our destruction and perpetrate terrorism against our citizens,&quot; Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told the US secretary of state, John Kerry, in a phone call. Netanyahu convened his cabinet on Friday to decide on a response. Kerry said: &quot;Hamas, which has security control over the Gaza Strip, must immediately and unconditionally release the missing Israeli soldier. The international community must now redouble its efforts to end the tunnel and rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists on Israel.&quot; Britain&apos;s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, urged Israel to enter direct negotiations with Hamas. Writing for the Guardian, he said: &quot;It is time for the Israeli government to talk to the Hamas political leadership in Gaza.&quot; Clegg has already gone much further than any Conservative government minister by saying Israel&apos;s actions appear to be disproportionate and a form of collective punishment. An IDF spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, said the truce was broken at about 9.30am when Israeli soldiers had been preparing to destroy a Hamas tunnel running from Gaza into Israel, as the ceasefire terms allowed, when a group of militants emerged from an underground shaft. Lerner said there was at least one suicide attacker in the assault. After an exchange of fire, Goldin was reported missing. According to the Haaretz news website, IDF soldiers followed the attackers through the tunnel, which came up in an empty mosque. Special forces were sent to search the surrounding neighbourhood, supported by heavy artillery and warplanes, which caused the high civilian casualties. The soldier&apos;s father, Simha Goldin, a Tel Aviv University professor, issued a brief statement outside his home. &quot;We want to support the military in the fighting against Hamas in Gaza,&quot; he said. &quot;We are sure the military will not stop before it turns over every stone in Gaza and returns Hadar home safe and sound.&quot; Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior official in the Hamas political wing, told Turkish media that an IDF soldier had been taken, but that the attack occurred 90 minutes before the ceasefire came into effect at 8am and was therefore not a violation. However, subsequent Hamas statements denied having taken a captive. In the two hours before the truce collapsed, Gazans had emerged from hiding in an effort to restart their lives. In Gaza City, fishermen immediately put to sea, cautiously keeping close to the shore, after nearly four weeks without working. Streets filled quickly. Samira Attar, 27, a housewife sitting in a donkey cart with her husband, five children and three mattresses, said she was heading back to her house in Atattraa, northern Gaza. She had been staying with relatives. &quot;I am going back to my house for the first time for 17 days,&quot; Attar said. &quot;I hope this ceasefire will hold for the 72 hours and longer, God willing. We don&apos;t need more bloodshed, or more devastation. I&apos;d like to see Israel be defeated and broken but the circumstances were very difficult.&quot; In Beit Hanoun, a town near the northern border of Gaza that has seen sustained bombardment and fighting, it was clear at 11am that the ceasefire had broken down. Amid shelling and small-arms fire, families returning to salvage belongings or see what had happened to their homes rushed for safety.     Lieutenant Hadar Goldin. Photograph: EPA    As reports of fighting and casualties in Rafah started filtering in, the streets of Gaza City began to empty. The ministry of health in Gaza called for immediate international assistance to evacuate thousands of civilians &quot;trapped under heavy Israeli bombardment&quot; in Rafah. It said: &quot;Some 5km between Salah al-Eddin street and al-Najar hospital is under intense and indiscriminate artillery fire, ambulances are unable to reach the wounded and thousands of civilians are trapped in their homes. We cannot reach the civilians to evacuate them, the wounded to provide medical care, or the dead to retrieve their bodies.&quot; Maria-Cecilia Goin, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the &quot;humanitarian space&quot; in Gaza was shrinking, with intense fighting in the north, east and south of the strip seriously impeding its work.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-01T22:24:00Z", "title": "Israel bombards Rafah after soldier disappears amid Gaza ceasefire collapse", "sentences": ["The soldier&apos;s father, Simha Goldin, a Tel Aviv University professor, issued a brief statement outside his home."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/israel-bombards-rafah-soldier-disappears-gaza-ceasefire-collapse"}, {"tags": ["Natalia Osipova", "Ballet", "Dance", "Stage", "Culture", "Edward Watson"], "article": "The Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin has a strict rule about morning class: anyone who wants to watch him teach must also take part. Which is why, foolhardily, I find myself in a dance studio in southern California, attempting to keep pace with Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev, the most celebrated ballet partnership of our times. The class we&apos;re taking is called Gaga, the idiosyncratic and closely considered technique on which Naharin has based his choreographic philosophy and style. It&apos;s all about sensitising the mind and body, making dancers alert to the texture and flow of their movements, to their relationship with the surrounding space. So in response to Naharin&apos;s fluid verbal instructions, the Russians and I are stretching, shaking and rippling our limbs. We&apos;re vocalising our breath by singing and shouting out loud. As I desperately summon movement skills I lost years ago, I catch glimpses of Osipova&apos;s leg arcing through a perfect 180-degree stretch, and of Vasiliev skittering at incredible speed across the room. The dancers look completely and unselfconsciously absorbed in what they&apos;re doing, but afterwards Osipova admits that when they took their first Gaga class they were traumatised. &quot;We\u00a0thought, &apos;What are we doing here?&apos; We couldn&apos;t do the movement because it used such different muscle systems from ballet. It wasn&apos;t like any class we knew. People were screaming and talking. There was no mirror, no barre.&quot;     Osipova and Vasiliev rehearsing. Photograph: Barry J Holmes       But that first Gaga class was for them a deliberate and necessary initiation into the unknown. Ever since Osipova and Vasiliev left the Bolshoi in 2011 they&apos;ve been on a quest for new dance experiences, and while each has found a wider classical repertory in other companies (Osipova recently joining the Royal Ballet), they&apos;ve been hungry to experiment with contemporary dance. Here at the Segerstrom Centre in Costa Mesa they&apos;re in final preparations for Solo for Two, an evening-length show in which they perform duets by three radically different choreographers, Naharin, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Arthur Pita. All three were selected by Osipova, who has been watching a variety of dance since she left Moscow. She chose Pita on the strength of the vividly theatrical pieces he has created for Edward Watson, one of her regular partners at the Royal Ballet. &quot;Arthur is a great director, on the edge between normal and a little bit crazy. You think his work is about something banal or funny, a little bit kitschy, but then it takes you somewhere deeper.&quot; It was in London that she&apos;d also seen Cherkaoui&apos;s work \u2013 and if she first fell in love with the sensuousness of his style, she would become equally enchanted by the choreographer himself and his exceptional serenity. &quot;I like him so much in the studio \u2013 he&apos;s\u00a0like a small Buddha.&quot; Her starting point for the show, however, was Naharin. &quot;I&apos;ve been watching his work for many years, hoping one day I could try to do it. It looks simple but it has so much atmosphere and energy. It&apos;s as if the dancers are creating the movement from themselves \u2013 not just steps but part of their life.&quot;     Osipova and Vasiliev rehearsing. Photograph: Barry J Holmes       Naharin agreed to work with the Russians on condition that they first visit him in his Tel Aviv studio, for a fast-track immersion in his teaching methods and style. But he had no real doubts about the project. &quot;They have such a level of technical skill. It&apos;s like an aura around them.&quot; Even though there hasn&apos;t been time for him, or for the other two choreographers, to create new work from scratch, he says it&apos;s been fascinating to develop existing material in close collaboration with the pair. &quot;I wanted to make a playground for their skills, a place where they could enjoy my work.&quot; He finds it interesting that Osipova, 28, and Vasiliev, 25, have begun to experiment with contemporary dance so early in their careers. Classical dancers typically attempt that transition much later, as Sylvie Guillem or Mikhail Baryshnikov did, in their late 30s or early 40s. But Osipova and Vasiliev insist they&apos;re more than ready. &quot;Sometimes Ivan and I feel our carers run so fast,&quot; Osipova says. &quot;We tasted success so early that we&apos;re ready for something new.&quot; Vasiliev adds: &quot;It&apos;s best to try new things when you&apos;re still in shape, when you can bring all your physical powers.&quot; And certainly when I watch them in rehearsal it&apos;s a revelation to see how these two Bolshoi-trained artists are able to modulate their high-impact style to the very differently nuanced, grounded styles of their three contemporary choreographers. Osipova works very intently at her material \u2013 when a movement or a\u00a0stylistic subtlety eludes her she can get angrily frustrated. Vasiliev seems to react more intuitively and he&apos;s also an irrepressible joker, as though all the energy he channels into the herculean virtuosity of his ballet roles has to find another outlet. When Naharin instructs him to tense his hand into a claw, he glances at Osipova and starts to stalk her like a predatory dinosaur. She rolls her eyes and bursts into giggles. It seems that for both of them, working 10-hour days and under the pressure of a fast-approaching premiere, Vasiliev&apos;s clowning is a necessary safety valve. &quot;Our bodies have bruises, so we need to smile,&quot; says Osipova, acknowledging not only her current fatigue, but also the difficulties she&apos;s encountered with this project along the way. &quot;After we started working with Ohad, my body was changing so much I felt like it couldn&apos;t do classical ballet any more. But the contemporary wasn&apos;t looking that good either.&quot; She had a similar struggle with the opening section of Cherkaoui&apos;s duet Mercy, which pits the dancers against each other in a fast, jabbing, martial arts-style fight. &quot;I cried so much, it was so difficult. Each movement had to be so exact, so strong.&quot;     Osipova and Vasiliev rehearsing. Photograph: Barry J Holmes       Later over dinner, the two of them are more relaxed. Osipova downs two large beers while mocking Vasiliev&apos;s prodigious appetite \u2013 he&apos;s polished off four enormous platefuls of food almost before the rest of us have finished our starters. The two of them joke about her heartbroken support for Argentina in the World Cup, about his newfound\u00a0passion for choreography. And their obvious ease and affection is all the more beguiling given that the two of them have only recently ended an off-stage relationship that many assumed was heading towards\u00a0marriage. When the couple broke up last year, it was speculated that they would also stop dancing together, and that the stage partnership that had been dubbed Vasipova would be no more. They dismiss the idea as ridiculous. &quot;We have a wonderful relationship,&quot; says Osipova. &quot;We&apos;re very good friends and we respect and trust each other.&quot; Their agent, Sergei Danilian, who is also the producer of Solo for Two, believes the pair are actually much happier now. &quot;When they were a couple there was too much pressure, too much drama. They were with each other constantly. Now they have time apart, it&apos;s better.&quot; Nonetheless, fans around the world mourn their breakup and may react against the more violently antagonistic elements in their new material, especially the blackly surreal story in Pita&apos;s Facada that sees Osipova as a jilted bride taking murderous revenge on her fiance. Pita, who had no idea of the dancers&apos; history when he began working with them, says he&apos;s specially worried about the reaction in Moscow, where the show has a brief run before arriving in London. &quot;I know there are a lot of old ladies there who long for Natasha and Ivan to come back to the Bolshoi. They&apos;ll probably lynch me for showing her knifing him on stage and then dancing on his grave.&quot; Those same fans may also resent the fact that Solo for Two, far from being a one-off experiment, has made the dancers hanker for more. &quot;I&apos;d like to do\u00a0some flamenco,&quot; says Osipova, &quot;like that beautiful show Larbi did with Maria Pag\u00e9s. Or try that work he did with the Shaolin Monks.&quot; But even though she&apos;s long suspected that her temperament is best suited to the freedoms of contemporary dance, Osipova is looking forward to applying her new skills to ballet. &quot;The harmony you have in contemporary between your mind and body, the way movements come from what you have in your thoughts \u2013 I would like to take that to the classical repertory.&quot; Vasiliev laughs. &quot;Swan Lake, like Ohad.&quot; As Naharin points out, whatever Osipova and Vasiliev do, they make it extraordinary. &quot;There are very good dancers in the world and there are excellent dancers, but the ones who are sublime are very rare. Natasha and Ivan have that power to create sublime moments. And even if I can show just one or two of those moments in a piece, it&apos;s worth it for me.&quot; \u2022 Solo for Two opens at the London Coliseum on 6 August.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-03T17:00:01Z", "title": "All change for Osipova and Vasiliev", "sentences": ["Photograph: Barry J Holmes       Naharin agreed to work with the Russians on condition that they first visit him in his Tel Aviv studio, for a fast-track immersion in his teaching methods and style."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/natalia-osipova-ivan-vasiliev-interview"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "UK news", "War crimes", "Human rights", "Law", "Nick Clegg", "Ed Miliband", "David Cameron", "Politics"], "article": "The ceaseless use of overwhelming military force on Gaza by Israel\u2019s military in complete disregard for any reasonable interpretation of international humanitarian and human rights law is an outrage of unspeakable proportions (Outrage after third strike on Gaza school, 4 August).

An acutely abhorrent practice at the forefront of Israel\u2019s brutally destructive military campaign is the deliberate targeting of family residential homes in apparent grave violation of international law. Since the launch of this Israeli military operation, it is estimated by the United Nations that over 900 houses have been totally destroyed or severely damaged, causing vast civilian casualties, including multiple members of the same families.

This deliberate and systematic targeting policy is an obscenity against humanity and clearly appears to amount to the commission of war crimes, and further to crimes against humanity, due to its apparent serious violation of the basic laws of war principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. We urge the UK government to publicly condemn Israel\u2019s policy of directly targeting family homes in Gaza, and indirectly targeting whole families, confirming such actions as being unlawful, given that no such homes constitute a legitimate military target. We further urge the UK government to lead the international community in ensuring that credible investigations and full legal accountability is secured for all serious violations of international humanitarian law during this horrific conflict. A thorough implementation of independent investigation and judicial processes is critically important to provide justice for innocent victims, accountability for grave criminal wrongdoing, and deter the types of atrocities which characterise this terrifyingly cruel conflict from being repeated.Tareq Shrourou Director, Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, Daniel Machover, Michael Mansfield QC, Professor Bill Bowring, Rachel Waller, Andrea Becker, Charlotte Dollard, Hannah Rought Brooks, Claire Jeffery, Nusrat Uddin, Alicia Araujo Mendonca, Sumiya Hemsi, Laila Hamzi, Geoffrey Bindman QC, Tom Short \u2022 Geoffrey Robertson is absolutely right (International law might yet punish Gaza\u2019s war crimes, 2 August). In present circumstances, the crucial requirement is justice: a lasting peace cannot be established if justice is denied, and therefore taking the warring parties to the international criminal court is essential. The Rome statute \u2013 at article 8 para 2b (iv) \u2013 defines as a war crime \u201cintentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects \u2026 which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated\u201d. Israel claims its response to the alleged storage and launching of Palestinian rockets close to or from UN-declared safe zones is justified but, as the Rome statute specifies unequivocally, the benefit to Israel of destroying a few Hamas rocket launchers must be sufficient to justify the civilian damage caused. Moreover, the reportedly highly effective Iron Dome system gives Israel a means of protecting Israeli citizens without any civilian damage. As Robertson points out, there can be no possible advantage to Israel that would justify the knowing killing of so many children. In the horse-trading that preceded the successful Palestinian application for statehood, it seems that the Palestinian Authority agreed with the US not to take Israel to the ICC: the subsequent horrific events amply justify abandoning that undertaking and the PA making a request to the ICC for an investigation of war crimes in the Gaza war.Professor David E PeggYork \u2022 Nick Clegg\u2019s article is accurate and even-handed (Israel has to talk to Hamas, 2 August). A political solution is the only answer, but what incentive does Israel have to enter such a process when the US provides $3bn worth of arms to it annually while posing as a broker of peace? Europe should make a combined effort to put pressure on America to stop being Israel\u2019s arms dealer and rather to insist on Israel leaving all occupied Palestinian territory. Europe will fail, of course, but will be seen at least to have done what is right and may just strike a chord somewhere that will lead to peace.Jacqueline WarnerYarmouth, Isle of Wight \u2022 \u201cThe Jews under siege in the Warsaw ghetto\u201d did indeed \u201cdig a network of tunnels\u201d (Letters, 2 August), but the comparison with Gaza ends there. The Jews of Warsaw were not facing a siege, they were facing total extermination. They had no rockets to launch at German civilians. Hamas, by contrast, uses rockets and tunnels to attack Israeli civilians, both Jewish and Arab (Israeli Bedouin have come under fire) as part of its campaign to destroy the country whose very existence it refuses to recognise, hence the siege. While a negotiated settlement is clearly essential and the suffering and loss of life deeply disturbing, it is difficult to see how any resolution can be effected so long as Hamas eschews the route of dialogue in favour of its stated objective of eliminating Israel.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords \u2022 Ed Miliband is right to criticise David Cameron for not sending out \u201ca clear and unequivocal message to both sides in the conflict\u201d in Gaza (Miliband rounds on PM\u2019s failure to condemn Israel, 4 August). Israel\u2019s indiscriminate and disproportionate use of military force, and the terrible suffering of the people of Gaza, well documented in recent weeks, has been met with government silence. Unlike many countries in Latin America, which have recalled their ambassadors from Tel Aviv to protest against the continuing slaughter of innocent people in Gaza, the UK government has not even summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to express concern. Surely the time has come for Britain to take more robust action. It should consider an immediate recall of Matthew Gould, our ambassador to Israel. Politicians might pretend his continued presence is necessary if Britain is to have any influence in securing a ceasefire. Surely the opposite is true. The withdrawal of our ambassador would send out a strong signal that would clearly demonstrate the disgust felt by the majority of UK citizens.Judy CumberbatchLondon \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2014.

Carl\u2019s terror-stricken, almost-grimace has to be up there, right?\u201d You have to feel for poor Carl. A year or so ago, Arsenal tried to be subtle, asking him to design a \u201climited edition\u201d baseball hat \u2013 revealed at the \u201cspectacular launch event\u201d for the club\u2019s new away kit, and to be given away \u201cfree\u201d with each order submitted in the first two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more subtle than your traditional cap and I think it would appeal to people my age. It was fun and I\u2019m quite proud to have my own hat. I\u2019m going to try and get hold of one myself!\u201d he said. The free careers advice was spurned, and he remained in situ, so has now been sent to spend a season with Sam Allardyce. Perhaps this time, the message will be appreciated. Another player transferred against his will was Jaap Stam, one minute picking the marble top for his island, the next, testing positive for nandralone. But, in between times, he was also packed off from Manchester United to Lazio, for a variety of compelling reasons: he had mildly needled his manager in a book; he had affectionately mocked his team-mates in a book; the 35-year-old Laurent Blanc was suddenly and inexplicably available; the plc needed paying back following the signings of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. So it was that Stam was forced to Rome, and at the press conference where things were made official, he sat glaring, gaping and gulping, his enormous frame squashed into a Lazio jersey that went exceptionally badly with his suit trousers. A different Dutchman was less than amused to arrive at United, Jordi Cruyff scowling at his introductory photocall. Common wisdom states that he did not want to leave Barcelona, though it\u2019s also possible that he simply disapproved of Alex Ferguson\u2019s blazer-shirt-tie-slacks combo. More recently, Emmanuel Frimpong exhibited the attitude that has endeared him to all when moving from Arsenal to Barnsley, David Goodwillie did not look especially impressed when leaving Blackburn for Aberdeen this summer, Robinho was decidedly unamused at leaving Real Madrid for Manchester City, and Shaquille Coulthirst did not appear to find the English Riviera to his taste.         An underwhelmed Nicolas Anelka pitches up at West Brom    Other notable underwhelmees include Bradley Orr, Fabio Da Silva and Nicolas Anelka. On signing for the Baggies, he displayed his new shirt as though it were made of asbestos and last been worn by the smelly kid. Others who left clubs when they might rather have stayed include Roy Race, departing Melchester for Walford in the summer of 1983, following a boardroom row, and Johnny \u201cthe Hard Man\u201d Dexter. During Danefield United\u2019s summer tour of Europe in 1985, Dexter lost his place in the team to Bobby Williams, and, given his age and temper, the only side interested in signing him were Burnside Athletic, who had finished bottom of the fourth division in three of the previous four seasons. This was not at all well received, but Dexter led them to promotion, before joining Melchester, its squad decimated after the Basran carbomb disaster.

Photograph: Pedro Armestre/AFP/Getty Images    WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG \u201cNorwich City recently suffered the ignominy of claiming they\u2019d beaten Serie D side Saint-Christophe Vall\u00e9e d\u2019Aoste 13-0 in a pre-season fixture, only to be pulled up by Saint-Christophe Vall\u00e9e d\u2019Aoste, who advised them that the team they had played was in fact a selection of non-professionals from their surrounding region, somewhat taking the glaze off the emphatic victory,\u201d reports Michael Crompton. \u201cTo cover my fellow Canaries\u2019 blushes, are there any similar tales of mistaken identity for us to take comfort from?\u201d Yes, Norwich were scheduled to play Novara, a team from Italy\u2019s Serie C \u2013 but the game was cancelled. So, in order to avoid the fate suffered by Leeds, forced to play among themselves when Romania\u2019s Viitorul Constanta didn\u2019t turn up, new opposition were sought. Unfortunately, they were not who they were thought to be, forcing the following official statement, its importance underlined by the use of a capital \u201cC\u201d for \u201cClub\u201d: \u201cIn our original match report for this warm-up fixture, acting in good faith on the basis of information given to the Club, we incorrectly reported that we had played against local club side SC Vallee d\u2019Aoste\u201d, it read. \u201cIn fact the game was against an Aosta regional select side and we are happy to put the record straight and apologise to SC Vallee d\u2019Aoste and their fans for the misunderstanding. The game was convened at very short notice following the late cancellation of our previously scheduled match against Novara.\u201d Conspicuous by its absence was an explanation as to quite how this all came to pass, the space where one might have expected to find it instead full of guff, of all the things. \u201cThe hospitality shown to Norwich City Football Club by the people in Saint-Vincent and the surrounding area has been excellent and our training camp there has seen the squad continue to build their fitness levels, as we gear up for our three forthcoming friendlies against top-flight European opposition in the shape of SC Bastia, OGC Nice and Celta Vigo.\u201d Meanwhile, Alun Thomas emails in thusly: \u201cOxbarn Social Club, a Sunday League side from Wolverhampton, went on a pre-internet pre-season trip to Germany in 1973. They\u2019d written to the mayor of Mainz hoping to arrange a match against suitable opposition. Somewhere, wires got crossed and Oxbarn got mixed up with Wolves, who\u2019d just finished fifth in Division One. A match against third-tier SVW Mainz resulted with queues at the turnstiles and the opposition apparently on \u00a380 a man win bonus. Oxbarn lost 21-0.\u201d The Birmingham Mail has more on the tale  and caught up with John Shorthouse, who played at full-back that day. \u201cI think we got the ball into their half twice,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBy the end the crowd cheered every time we touched it. To be fair, the German players didn\u2019t celebrate after the 14th goal. But they didn\u2019t go easy, they were having none of that.\u201d Oxbarn would have gain some revenge at the post-match reception, mind. \u201cWe all got rolling drunk \u2013 our keeper was sick on the coach going back \u2013 but they were in an even worse state because they weren\u2019t used to alcohol,\u201d said Shorthouse. \u201cWe definitely won the drinking game!\u201d And here\u2019s Peter Goldstein: \u201cIn 2004 the national team of El Salvador visited Zimbabwe, and drew 0-0 with a local side in Harare. The problem: it wasn\u2019t really the national side. It was a select XI chosen from clubs in El Salvador that passed itself off as the national side. When the Zimbabweans found out that the Salvadorans, as the papers put it, \u2018le hab\u00edan vendido gato por liebre\u2019 (literally \u2018had sold them cat instead of hare\u2019), the squad literally fled the country before the second scheduled friendly. Incidentally, one of the Salvadoran papers noted it was a shame the second game had been cancelled, because Bob Marley had once appeared at that stadium. Spanish speakers who want more of the wonderful gory details should google \u2018Caso Zimbabue\u2019 Salvador\u2019.\u201d Tangentially, and in other select side anecdotes, the Knowledge and many of its equally unpleasant acquaintances once found itself in the crowd when Watford travelled to Israel in the summer 1998. Though the trip was principally for the purpose of quenching thirst at Tel Aviv\u2019s Bar International, it was cunningly disguised as a close-season friendly against a combined Petah Tikva team. Graham Taylor, in his second spell as manager of the Hornets, appeared to be somewhat surprised when regaled extensively and at volume for his achievements while manager of England. Ten years later, Lithuania turned up in the Czech Republic, to help their hosts warm up for the European Championships. But local officials had confused their stag destinations, thinking that they\u2019d invited Latvia, and as such the match programme advertised as much. But even after that, the error wasn\u2019t spotted \u2013 lining up prior to kick-off, the Lithuanian players were regaled with the Latvian national anthem. Both men responsible for the amusement left their posts, you will no doubt be relieved to learn. And finally, one final case of mistaken identity, straight out of a comic book: that of twin brothers, Srdjan and Zvezdan Cebinac. In 1965, both went on trial at FC K\u00f6ln. Zvezdan impressed, so the club decided to sign him, but instead, accidentally offered terms to Srdjan, who gratefully pounced upon them. He played just three games prior to being booted off to Sittardia, while his brother, known as Zick-Zack, eventually signed for N\u00fcrnberg, and was also capped 20 times by Yugoslavia. REPEAT BANISHMENTS \u201cHas there ever been another footballer banned for the start of two consecutive seasons?\u201d asks Sam Bailey. \u201cOf these, is there anyone else whose ban stems from their committing the exact same offense two seasons in a row?\u201d As far as the first part of the question goes, of course there has, and of course it was Eric Cantona. He actually missed the first four games of 1993-94 with injury, and then, before the following pre-season, had even started, attracted controversy \u2013 in America to commentate on the World Cup, he was banned from so doing following an altercation with a technician. A few weeks later, Manchester United travelled to Glasgow, where they were to play in a tournament also featuring Newcastle, Rangers and Sampdoria, evidently not put off the British Isles despite David Batty\u2019s efforts in the summer of 1992. They began with a 1-1 draw against Newcastle, Cantona scoring their goal \u2013 but lost 6-5 on penalties. So, the following day, and with Sean Connery in attendance, they met Rangers, eliminated by Sampdoria, and moments before half-time, David May fittingly marked the start of his auspicious United career with an accomplished own goal. Cantona had started the game on the bench, but replaced Dion Dublin after the break, and quickly established a row with Steven Pressley, earning himself a booking on 81 minutes for walking away from the referee, Andrew Waddell. Then, a minute later, a lunge at the aforementioned \u2013 more matter-of-principle than violent, accordingly avoided with a light skip \u2013 resulted in a red card. Already suspended for the start of United\u2019s European campaign, after being sent off post-match against Galatasaray the previous season, he would also now miss the first three league games. But Alex Ferguson was sanguine: \u201cAs far as I am aware walking away from a referee is not a bookable offence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Eric feels there has been an injustice he has to correct it. He can\u2019t control his temper in such a situation. But I\u2019m still delighted to have him and we will have to live with his faults.\u201d However, the Independent\u2019s James Traynor was less forgiving. \u201cIt will continue to be a costly existence,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut one wonders how long United, who start their campaign at home to Queen\u2019s Park Rangers, can \u2013 or should \u2013 tolerate Cantona\u2019s fragile temperament. Also, there should be no disguising the fact that United were playing in an unimportant pre-season match and one of their best players was dismissed because he could not cope with a 21-year-old, Pressley, who cannot hold down a regular place in Rangers\u2019 first team. Ferguson\u2019s Mon Genius is becoming an increasingly costly luxury.\u201d Then, in January, Cantona became frustrated by the continual foul play of Crystal Palace\u2019s Richard Shaw, flicking out a leg in protest. For this, he was dismissed, and on his way off, subjected to abuse from fan Matthew Simmons. Understandably, he saw no reason as to why he should tolerate such behaviour, remonstrating in stern terms \u2013 but the FA felt differently. They and United cut a deal \u2013 United would suspend Cantona until the end of the season \u2013 but the FA reneged, extending the ban until the start of October. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cHave any footballers ever been honoured for their off-the-field bravery?\u201d asked John Bennett in 2009. We received a deluge of responses to John\u2019s question, each outlining footballers who have received awards for their heroism during the first world war, enough to highlight just a small selection of them in a Knowledge special. Here is an excerpt:  Bernard Vann (Northampton Town and Derby County): Vann signed as an amateur for Northampton as an 18-year-old in 1905, joining his brother Albert at the club, and made a handful of appearances before switching to Derby in 1907, again as an amateur. In 1908 he made his only three appearances for the Rams, playing against Aston Villa, Notts County and Birmingham before leaving the Football League behind to attend Cambridge University and then begin a career as a chaplain and teacher. After joining the army at the outbreak of the first world war, Vann rose swiftly up the military ranks and won the Military Cross during the Battle of Loos in 1915, a battle in which Albert was killed. His won the Victoria Cross in 1918 after the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, during which \u201che led his battalion with great skill across the Canal du Nord through a very thick fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns\u201d. Unfortunately Vann\u2019s VC was a posthumous one \u2013 in October of the same year he was shot through the heart by a sniper\u2019s bullet. The full heroic story is here.

Life, after four weeks of war and 36 hours of peace, is returning to the pavements of this scruffy, upscale thoroughfare in the centre of Gaza City. The ceasefire brokered between Hamas and Israel by Egypt on Monday night has held, to the surprise of many. Some are simply happy to eat falafel without fear of an airstrike or stray shell. Others have errands to run. Still more search water or fuel. But if the focus is on the immediate, all are avidly watching the ongoing negotiations in Cairo between the Palestinian delegation and Israelis. The ceasefire is set to expire at 8am on Friday morning. In a hotel on the eastern outskirts of the Egyptian capital, where the corridors were swarming with Egyptian intelligence officers, Palestinian negotiators had been locked in talks with Egyptian officials for most of the day. They emerged tight-lipped in the late afternoon, refusing to release news of their negotiations until the Egyptian mediators had updated their Israeli counterparts \u2013 who flew into Cairo in the early evening \u2013 on the latest developments. At 9pm, Israeli media reported that the temporary ceasefire had been extended \u2013 but in Cairo this was seen as a unilateral Israeli decision. An official announcement about whether the ceasefire will be extended was not expected until Thursday morning, after the Israeli delegation, who prefer not to stay overnight in Cairo, leave again for Tel Aviv. &quot;There was a meeting, but there isn&apos;t anything new,&quot; said Gamal Shobky, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo. The Palestinian delegation \u2013 which consists of delegates from the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas and a second Gazan faction, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) \u2013 are pushing for an end to the eight-year siege of Gaza, which has seen Egypt and Israel block most supplies into the enclave. Hamas are willing to share power in Gaza with the PA, who run the West Bank \u2013 but have repeatedly stated they are unwilling to disarm their military wing as part of any deal, Israel&apos;s main demand. Despite the many and significant strains on the ceasefire talks, expectations in Gaza are high that talks will conclude with an agreement significantly improving the lives of its 1.8 million people, exhausted after seven years of economic blockade and three devastating wars. For Palestinians, the one key demand is an end to the eight-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. &quot;Hamas was clever enough to raise slogans of raising the blockade because [they are] in touch with people&apos;s needs,&quot; said Omar Shaban, an analyst in Gaza City. More than 1,800 Palestinians were killed the conflict, according to local officials, largely civilians. After four weeks of devastating conflict, Hossam Diba, who runs a shoe shop, is convinced that Gaza&apos;s losses cannot have been in vain: &quot;I am expecting they will get the Rafah border [into Egypt] open and extend the fishing zone into the sea. If we don&apos;t get it it will be very depressing. The world will be meaningless. We will have lost all these martyrs for nothing.&quot; But finding common ground among the negotiating teams in Cairo will be far from easy. Each side brings competing and potentially irreconcilable demands to the table. The Israeli blockade was aimed at undermining Hamas, which it wants to disarm, a concession the group appears unwilling to make. The group has fired more than 3,000 missiles at Israel in recent weeks, killing three. The blockade of Gaza has crippled the economy, sending unemployment soaring and incomes plunging. &quot;Of course lifting the siege will benefit Hamas. In the short term they will say to the people &apos;look we achieved something&apos; and in the longer term they will feel more relaxed. But [if the blockade is not eased] you create an incubator for radicalism and extremism. Everyone feels punished for something they didn&apos;t do,&quot; said Shaban. Most in Gaza City praised Hamas \u2013 listed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and EU \u2013 although analysts have pointed out that anyone who did criticise the group during &quot;wartime&quot; would risk being branded a &quot;traitor&quot;, a crime punishable with death. In Shuja&apos;iyeh, where bombardment and fierce combat levelled much of the neighbourhood and scores were killed, residents expressed their pride in the &quot;resistance&quot;. &quot;They tried to defend the people,&quot; said Zaid Zakut, a 32 year-old teacher whose house was badly damaged in the fighting. Surrounded by rubble, garbage and hanging power lines, Zakut said he hoped &quot;our leaders can get some solutions at the talks that are good for us and not for our enemies.&quot; The ceasefire has brought some easing of Gaza&apos;s humanitarian crisis but the situation remains grave. The number of displaced people staying in United Nations-run schools has dropped for the first time since the conflict began on 8 July \u2013 with at least 90,000 people heading home. Just under 190,000 people are left in 90 shelters. Israeli authorities are working to repair some power cables damaged on their side of the border by, they said, Hamas mortars. However, the reconstruction needs are vast. Around 6,000 housing units have been destroyed and another 5,000 rendered uninhabitable, making around 60,000 homeless, local officials said. The main power station will take six months at least to repair and fulfilled only a quarter of demand. Nabil Aby Muaileq, the chairman of the local construction contractors&apos; union, said that even before the war 50,000 truckloads of gravel, bitumen, steel and other materials had been needed just to complete ongoing \u2013 but frozen \u2013 projects. After the destruction of recent weeks, at least three times as much was now needed. &quot;We could get it in. It is not a question of logistics or capacity but just of faith and trust,&quot; Abu Muaileq said. Israeli officials have said they fear building materials will be used to construct more sophisticated tunnels leading which would allow Hamas fighters to infiltrate across the border to mount raids and kill or capture Israeli soldiers or civilians. The Israeli military said it has destroyed more than 30 such tunnels during the conflict. Abu Muaileq said one demand of Palestinian negotiators \u2013 that fishermen be allowed to operate further out to sea \u2013 was a distraction. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the fishing. Give me the materials to work here and I&apos;ll take all the fishermen and give them jobs on construction sites,&quot; he said. &quot;We just need to borders open for import and export. This will bring life to the economy and do more than any government can do to create jobs.&quot; Hamas \u2013 diplomatically isolated within the Arab world \u2013 know they need to show the people of Gaza they have gained from the conflict. Drawn out negotiations, though they may allow the ceasefire to become more solid, means risking the popularity they have gained in the conflict. Shaban said he expected the talks to &quot;take time&quot;. This would suit Rana Hadayid, who was buying toys for her five children on Omar al Mukhtar street on Wednesday afternoon: &quot;I wish they succeed with all the demands but please don&apos;t even talk about another war. Let us pray never again. The blood scares me.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-08-06T19:00:46Z", "title": "Gazans watch peace negotiations closely as they try to rebuild their lives", "sentences": ["An official announcement about whether the ceasefire will be extended was not expected until Thursday morning, after the Israeli delegation, who prefer not to stay overnight in Cairo, leave again for Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/gaza-negotiations-cairo-hamas-israel-continue-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["Australia news", "Surveillance"], "article": "Good morning folks, and welcome to the Morning Mail \u2013 sign up here to get it straight to your inbox before 8am every weekday.

He is fed up with being hassled in public and spat at, with people not willing to share the table next to him in restaurants. And now he is fed up with the constant presence of his bodyguards, not least because they too have started giving him a hard time about his political views. So he doesn&apos;t go out much any more and we sit in the calm of his living room, a few hundred yards from the Yitzhak Rabin Centre. Rabin&apos;s assassination by a rightwing Orthodox Jew in 1995 is itself a sobering reminder of the personal cost of peacemaking in Israel. In his column in Haaretz, Levy has long since banged the drum for greater Israeli empathy towards the suffering of the Palestinians. He is a well-known commentator on the left, and one of the few prepared to stick his head above the parapet. Consequently, he is no stranger to opposition from the right. But this time it is different. Yariv Levin, coalition chairman of the Likud-Beytenu faction in the Knesset, recently called for him to be put on trial for treason \u2013 a crime which, during wartime, is punishable by death. &quot;It is time we stop regarding despicable phenomena like this with tolerance,&quot; Levin said of Levy. Soon after that interview, Eldad Yaniv, a former political adviser to ex-prime minister Ehud Barack, wrote on his Facebook page: &quot;The late Gideon Levy. Get used to it.&quot; Levy&apos;s unpardonable crime is vocal opposition to the war and to the bombing of Gaza. According to recent polls, support for the military operation in Gaza among the Jewish Israeli public stands somewhere between 87% (Channel 10 News) and 95% (Israel Democracy Institute). Even those who are secretly against the war are cautious about voicing their opinion openly.     Gideon Levy. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Thus public opinion went ballistic when Levy attacked those who were bombing Gaza by inverting the well-known Hebrew phrase &quot;Hatovim La tayyis&quot; \u2013 which means: the best ones go to the air force \u2013 by writing &quot;Haraim La tayyis&quot;: the worst ones go to the air force. Even in a time of peace this would be seen as a provocative statement, a heresy against what Levy sees as Israel&apos;s real religion: military security. But in its current mood, this is not the sort of thing that you can easily say out loud. Even Peace Now, the backbone of the Israeli peace movement, has been remarkably guarded, carefully avoiding official participation in public demonstrations. Peace Now was founded in 1978 by former members of the military who came out strongly in favour of peace with Egypt. It helped mobilise 10% of the Israeli public \u2013 some 400,000 people \u2013 to turn out against the 1982 war in Lebanon. But this time it is a shadow of its former self. &quot;What is different this time is the anti-democratic spirit. Zero tolerance of any kind of criticism, opposition to any kind of sympathy with the Palestinians,&quot; says Levy. &quot;You shouldn&apos;t be surprised that the 95% [are in favour of the war], you should be surprised at the 5%. This is almost a miracle. The media has an enormous role. Given the decades of demonisation of the Palestinians, the incitement and hatred, don&apos;t be surprised the Israeli people are where they are.&quot; &quot;So what&apos;s the point of a peace movement if it refuses to condemn a war like this?&quot; I ask Mossi Raz, former general secretary of Peace Now. Some people have demonstrated, he assures me; 6,000 came out on the streets the Saturday before last (and were taunted as &quot;dirty Israelis&quot; by the rightwing counter demonstration). And in the circumstances, 6,000 feels like quite an achievement. But he admits that the mainstream protest movements and parties of the left all fall pretty silent when the sirens start to wail. &quot;People tend to demonstrate only after the war is over,&quot; Raz explains. And he expects the same to happen again this time. During the early part of the 1982 war, before the large turnouts, polls gave military action 86% support. But during a time of war, opposition is seen as disloyalty, as siding with the enemy. People will protest at the government, but not the military. I raise an eyebrow about the idea of protesting against a war only when it is over. He nods with a certain exasperation and asks me, as a joke: &quot;So, shall we go out now and protest the Falklands war?&quot; Amos Oz, Israel&apos;s great literary conscience, explains to me that the peace movement was dealt a harsh blow eight years ago when Ariel Sharon pulled the army and the settlers out of Gaza only for the situation to get worse. &quot;Since then there have been 10,000 rockets fired from the Gaza strip.&quot; Middle-of-the-road Israelis have lost faith in the idea that you could swap land for peace. For him, the current military operation is &quot;excessive but justified&quot; and he is scornful of the high-minded European reaction. &quot;That&apos;s the problem with Europeans. They launch a petition and then go and sleep and feel good about themselves&quot; \u2013 something he explains with reference to European history. I feel he is having a go at me. And I know he is laid up in bed with a bad knee. So I don&apos;t rise to the bait. He continues: &quot;The history of warfare in the 20th century has made Europeans see things in black and white, like a Hollywood movie, with good guys and bad guys. But it&apos;s more complicated than that.&quot; Yes, he condemns the Netanyahu government and the catalogue of inaction and missed opportunities. Yes, the operation in Gaza has been disproportionate. &quot;From one perspective it looks like a David and Goliath story, with Israel being the ruthless Goliath and the Palestinians being the poor little David. But if you see the conflict as between Israel and the whole of the rest of the Arab world, who then is David and who is Goliath?&quot; I attempt to shift Oz off this well-trodden ground by talking about Israeli poetry, trying to come at things sideways. I tell him I have always loved the Yehuda Amichai poem &quot;From the place where we are right, flowers will not grow in the spring.&quot; He agrees. It&apos;s a wonderful poem. &quot;All married couples should have that poem above their bed,&quot; he says. And then he says something that feels to me like a real shift in his position. Previously he has described the Israeli/Palestinian conflict as a Sophoclean tragedy over land in which both sides have a claim to right on their side; as a battle, as he put it of &quot;right versus right&quot;. But now, he says, this is a battle of &quot;wrong versus wrong&quot;. No one is in the right any more. It is a very statesmanlike form of opposition. But it is hardly emphatic. &quot;Amos Oz is not yet in a position to admit entire Israeli guilt,&quot; Levy explains. &quot;He is a real man of peace, but he grew up in a different generation, the generation before me. He grew up in this weak state, struggling to survive, created out of nothing. This is his background.&quot; This sort of self-critical vigilance is rare but understandable given the sort of reporting that goes on in themainstream media in Israel. Most newspapers and TV channels are simply cheerleaders for the government line, offering a constant diet of fear and fallen heroes, with little evidence of any of the atrocities going on in Gaza. The problem is, ordinary Israelis have little idea what has been going on. I know so much more about what is happening in Gaza when I&apos;m sitting in London than I do in Tel Aviv. Under this level of information manipulation, how can ordinary Israelis be expected to be critical? Later I go for a drink at a friend&apos;s flat in Tel Aviv with a group of broadly leftwing activists in their late 20s and early 30s, NGO types that I was expecting would share my exasperation. And I make a mistake, assuming too much common ground. I ask whether their fear of rockets is properly calibrated to reality, given that people are so much more likely to die in a car accident in Israel than at the hands of Hamas. And there is an awkward reaction. The question was insensitive. They have loved ones in uniform in Gaza. And I really do understand that. But suddenly I feel like an outsider. I haven&apos;t appreciated that this threat is existential, they say. &quot;People leave their liberalism at the green line [the 1967 border],&quot; Levy had warned me earlier. &quot;The young people are the worst. More ignorant. More brainwashed. They have never met a Palestinian in their lives.&quot; That is emphatically not true of this group. But even here, the mood for social justice does not seem to connect poverty in Israel with the vast financial cost of occupation, let alone allow empathy with the Palestinian predicament. If I&apos;m not with them, I&apos;m against them. I am made to feel a little like an apologist for Hamas. A thought dawns in my head: perhaps I too ought to shut up and keep the evening sweet. Of all the things seen on my trip, this was the most depressing conversation of them all.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-07T06:30:00Z", "title": "Against the war: the movement that dare not speak its name in Israel", "sentences": ["Gideon Levy doesn&apos;t want to meet in a coffee bar in Tel Aviv.", "I know so much more about what is happening in Gaza when I&apos;m sitting in London than I do in Tel Aviv.", "Later I go for a drink at a friend&apos;s flat in Tel Aviv with a group of broadly leftwing activists in their late 20s and early 30s, NGO types that I was expecting would share my exasperation."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/gaza-israel-movement-that-dare-not-speak-its-name"}, {"tags": ["Culture", "Theatre", "Film", "Music", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Festivals"], "article": "Three weeks ago, UK Jewish Film began receiving anxious emails and phone calls from the Tricycle Theatre, the north London home of the UK Jewish film festival for the past eight years. It\u2019s understood that the theatre board was making demands it had not made before. The board asked to be allowed to view in advance all of the films that were made with Israeli backing in order to approve their content. When the UKJFF dismissed this as censorship, the Tricycle conceded the point. But it refused to back down on another demand: that the festival should hand back the small percentage of its funding that came from the Israeli embassy. The UKJFF could not understand why this longstanding financial arrangement had only now become a dealbreaker and rejected the Tricycle\u2019s offer to make up the financial shortfall because it was a matter of principle. After two weeks of negotiations, this impasse remained and the UKJFF withdrew from the Tricycle, formally announcing its decision on Tuesday.  There is no geopolitical issue more bitterly divisive than Israel and Palestine at the best of times, let alone during the current conflict in Gaza, but this dispute has particularly serious implications for the relationship between artists, Israel and the British Jewish community. Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, called the Tricycle \u201cofficially antisemitic\u201d while Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theatre, backed the Tricycle\u2019s decision and said the UKJFF had \u201cunwisely politicised\u201d the festival. The Tricycle did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview and the UKJFF could not field an official spokesperson. However, Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, who has close ties to the festival, was willing to discuss the situation. \u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunistic attempt to bring an international political dispute into UK multi-faith culture,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cThis is a Jewish film festival. It\u2019s not an Israeli film festival. This is a major contributor to understanding of the entire conflict. It\u2019s all about building bridges and showing films which address all sides of the issue. To suddenly impose a condition just a few short days after the start of the Gaza situation strikes us in the Jewish community as a discriminatory boycott by the Tricycle Theatre.\u201d The issue of a cultural boycott of Israel has been gathering momentum since a broad coalition of Palestinian groups established the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in 2005. The BDS movement advocates a wide range of boycotts, including corporations, sports teams and academic institutions, until Israel meets three demands: \u201cEnding its occupation and colonisation of all Arab lands occupied in June 1967 and dismantling the Wall; recognising the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.\u201d According to Jewish-American activist and journalist Sherry Wolf, a member of the BDS-related US campaign Adalah-NY, \u201cthis last month has seen an escalation like nothing we have seen in the past nine years of BDS\u2019s existence\u201d. While the current Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) operation has been criticised by regular campaigners such as Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Ken Loach, Hanif Kureishi and Maxine Peake, less political stars have spoken out. Rihanna and One Direction\u2019s Zayn Malik both tweeted the hashtag #freepalestine, albeit provoking a backlash that made them wish they hadn\u2019t. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor recently explained pulling out of a concert in Caesarea in pungent terms: \u201cThere\u2019s not a sane person on Earth who in any way sanctions what the fuck the Israeli authorities are doing.\u201d     Pet Shop Boys, who defended an appearance in Israel, citing its difference from apartheid-era South Africa.    Of all the BDS movement\u2019s components, the cultural boycott is the most thorny because art prides itself on its power to build bridges. Towards the end of his long life as musician and campaigner, Pete Seeger resisted the idea of shutting these bridges down: \u201cI understand why someone would want to boycott a place financially, but I don\u2019t understand why you would boycott dialogue.\u201d While resisting demands to cancel a show in Israel last year, R&amp;B singer Alicia Keys fell back on sentimental rhetoric: \u201cMusic is a universal language that is meant to unify audiences in peace and love.\u201d For Wolf, however, Israel-Palestine has gone beyond civil dialogue and the unifying power of music. \u201cArt is intrinsically political and always has been. Artistic figures have an outsize profile in the world. Saying that Israel is a pariah state that must be isolated like South Africa was isolated is a way of saying we will not allow our art to be used to pretend that this is a dialogue between two peoples. It\u2019s occupation, it\u2019s racism, it\u2019s ethnic cleansing. We will not normalise the occupation and the apartheid of Israel.\u201d Comparisons with South Africa are imperfect. First, that boycott was codified by a UN resolution. Second, it was criticised at the time for penalising South African performers who opposed apartheid. Third, white South Africans were not a discrete ethnic or religious group. Fourthly, many people, including critics of Israel, dispute the accuracy of the \u201capartheid\u201d tag. Defending the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 decision to play in Israel last year, Neil Tennant wrote: \u201cIsrael has (in my opinion) some crude and cruel policies based on defence; it also has universal suffrage and equality of rights for all its citizens both Jewish and Arab. In apartheid-era South Africa, artists could only play to segregated audiences; in Israel anyone who buys a ticket can attend a concert.\u201d Nonetheless, the comparison is fundamental to the premise of BDS. For individual artists, this means that even people who would rather avoid broadcasting their views are forced to publicly take sides or fudge their positions. Pixies were added to the list of BDS supporters after cancelling a Tel Aviv concert in 2010 but that turned out to be for security reasons and they finally played in the city two months ago. Elvis Costello cancelled two 2010 dates with a contorted statement that seemed neither to endorse nor condemn the boycott. Some artists attempt to square the circle by using a platform in Israel to tackle the issues head-on. Defending his decision to accept the Jerusalem Prize for literature in 2011, Ian McEwan pointed out, \u201cIf I only went to countries that I approve of, I probably would never get out of bed.\u201d In his acceptance speech, he spoke at length about Israeli policy in Palestine, calling it \u201ca great and self-evident injustice\u201d. The novelist Linda Grant sums up her position thus: \u201cI\u2019m happy to press war crimes charges against politicians and generals, but not punish ballerinas and actors because you can\u2019t get at the powerful.\u201d     Ian McEwan, who argues in favour of using a platform in Israel to speak out. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod    The unease many artists feel about a boycott stems from the fact that of all the countries committing reprehensible acts, the only one being targetted on this scale is the world\u2019s only Jewish nation, and this carries uncomfortable echoes of the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses that preceded the Holocaust. \u201cIt\u2019s completely the wrong message,\u201d says Simon Johnson. \u201cIsrael is one of the only countries in that region where films that are critical of the government are freely shown with no intimidation to artists and film-makers. A cultural boycott does nothing to promote peace, harmony and goodwill. What it does is promote division and conflict between people and it is utterly discriminatory.\u201d While he stops short of calling the Tricycle\u2019s decision antisemitic, he adds that \u201cpeople in the Jewish community would be entitled to question the motives of those who took it\u201d. There is no doubt that there are antisemites among the boycott movement who target Jewish individuals. Human rights group PEN International recently condemned a list of \u201cIsraeli products to be boycotted\u201d, circulated on social media, that included the novels of Turkish-Jewish novelist Mario Levi. But the list was not endorsed by the BDS movement. Just as critics of Israel tend to highlight the pronouncements of its most hardline politicians, its defenders focus on outrageous antisemites; each side wants to present the other in the worst possible light. \u201cThere has never been an attack on Jews qua Jews,\u201d says Wolf. \u201cI live in Brooklyn. Twenty-five per cent of my neighbourhood is Jewish. A rising number of us are unequivocally pro-Palestine and horrified that we are identified in any shape or form with this massacre in Gaza. We must be clear: the cultural boycott is not a boycott of individuals. We purposefully wanted to avoid a McCarthyite blacklist. The propaganda machine of the Israeli state is considerable. Sending dance troupes [around the world] and then calling us out is at best cynicism and at worst rank hypocrisy.\u201d Wolf and Johnson are poles apart. Individuals can criticise Israel while opposing a boycott on principle but the two cannot be separated: the logic of the boycott stems from your opinion of the conflict. If you believe that Israel is as uniquely outrageous as South Africa once was, then it is clearly justified. If you do not, it isn\u2019t. Despite idealistic beliefs that art transcends everything, the boycott is as inflammatory as any other element of the conflict. The UKJFF is now going to spread its programme across several venues. People can decide for themselves whether it would have been better if the films had never been shown. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2014 to clarify that Sherry Wolf is a member, not the leader, of Adalah-NY and to clarify a quote about pro-Palestine feeling in her neighbourhood.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-07T09:05:20Z", "title": "Tricycle Theatre and Israel: the politics of the cultural boycott", "sentences": ["Pixies were added to the list of BDS supporters after cancelling a Tel Aviv concert in 2010 but that turned out to be for security reasons and they finally played in the city two months ago."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/06/-sp-tricycle-theatre-row-is-cultural-isolation-ever-right"}, {"tags": ["Shopping trips", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Manchester", "Greater Manchester", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "A group of Manchester shop workers were joined by local councillors and business officials in a counter protest against escalating demonstrations at chain stores with links to Israel on Thursday morning. The workers say they are being intimidated by growing numbers of pro-Palestinian protesters, who have held rallies outside stores such as H&amp;M and Schuh on Market Street, one of the city\u2019s busiest for shoppers. The protest was organised by the council and the Heart of Manchester Business Improvement District, a group of city centre retailers. Councillors said that staff are being \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d by protesters banging on shop windows and shouting abuse. Pat Karney, a Labour councillor, said: \u201cThey come down here on Saturdays, bang on the windows, frighten the workers and the shoppers and claim that the workers in there are part of some Zionist plot in Israel.

He said mobilise the workers not attack the workers.\u201d Demonstrations have been held in Piccadilly Gardens in the city for the last three weekends, but breakaway groups of hundreds of people have taken their action into Manchester\u2019s busy shopping streets. Kedem, a beauty shop on nearby King Street which sells products made in Israel has been targeted, and Karney claims H&amp;M has been the site of protest because it has a clothing store in Tel Aviv. \u201cI have enormous sympathy with the law-abiding people who are protesting in Piccadilly Gardens like they\u2019re doing up and down the country and across the world about events in the Middle East. They are very concerned about the death and destruction that\u2019s going on,\u201d Karney said.  \u201cThat does not mean they have a licence to intimidate these young shop workers in Manchester. You cannot take it out on them. Write to H&amp;M, seek meetings with them, but stop attacking young shop workers.\u201d Helen Playfair, aged 21, a Schuh worker, was one of around ten staff members who took part in the protest on Thursday morning, holding signs that read \u201cStand up for shop workers\u201d. \u201cOver the past few weeks we\u2019ve had a few people come with flags and megaphones shouting,\u201d she said. \u201cThe numbers of people that are coming have grown and it is really intimidating. Especially when we\u2019re all young people that work here.\u201d Councillors are now working to with police to try to contain the protests in Piccadilly Gardens. Labour\u2019s Kevin Peel, a city centre councillor, said: \u201cNo-one would be able to say that Manchester does not have a proud tradition of supporting people to protest.

Ihab al-Ghussein, the Islamist organisation&apos;s deputy information minister, said that &quot;if on [Sunday] we have no response to our demands, our defensive measures will be intensified&quot;. Sporadic rocket fire from Gaza into Israel continued on Saturday, along with air strikes by the Israeli military. Nine people were reported to have been killed in Gaza, including three when a mosque in the town of Nuseirat was destroyed at 3am. Twenty more have been injured, health workers in Gaza said. Israeli officials had telephoned inhabitants of homes around the mosque to tell them to evacuate, but men were thought to have been preparing for dawn prayers in its basement when the strike occurred, witnesses said. No Israeli casualties were reported on Saturday. Two Israelis had been hurt by a mortar attack the day before. Hamas refused to extend a three-day ceasefire that ended on Friday, saying a Palestinian negotiating team in Cairo had been offered nothing in return for peace. &quot;These are negotiations under pressure. The Egyptians are not impartial mediators. We are in pain, but we have patience to suffer,&quot; Ghussein said. Israel withdrew its negotiators from the indirect talks, saying that it would not negotiate while under fire. Azzam Ahmed, head of the Palestinian delegation, said negotiators would leave Cairo unless Israel agreed to return to talks without setting conditions. An estimated 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the most deadly round of fighting between Israel and Hamas since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning a surprise victory in Palestinian elections. Three civilians in Israel have been killed and 64 soldiers. The rockets being fired from Gaza have all been short-range. However, Hamas and other factions in Gaza have weapons that can reach Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, although most are intercepted by Israeli defence systems. Israeli air strikes killed five Palestinians on Friday, among them a 10-year-old boy near a mosque in Gaza City. The Palestinian negotiating team in Cairo, which includes members of all the main factions, has demanded the lifting of an eight-year-old Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the release of about 100 prisoners held by Israel. Israel insists that Hamas disarm; officials from the Palestinian group say this is &quot;inconceivable&quot;. Support for Hamas in Gaza still appeared to be strong. &quot;Of course, people are supporting the resistance,&quot; said Marwan Saifan, 37, as he watched the rubble of the destroyed mosque in Nuseirat being cleared. &quot;They are defending the people. They are fighting for our rights. Every house has lost a son, or a cousin, and that means more support for the resistance.&quot; Most people in Gaza blamed Israel for the renewal of hostilities, and said they supported the demands made by the delegation in Cairo. The blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt has sent unemployment soaring and standards of living plunging in the overcrowded enclave. Almost a third of Gaza&apos;s 1.8 million residents have been displaced by the recent violence, and an estimated 65,000 people are now homeless. Gaza&apos;s infrastructure has been badly damaged. Chris Gunness, spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said: &quot;Huge swaths of Gaza have been levelled. We cannot rebuild it with our hands tied. The blockade must end.&quot; More than 220,000 people are now staying in UN shelters. In one, a school in Beit Lahiya, about 1,000 people had to sleep outside because the 40 classrooms were full. About 3,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel in recent weeks. An increase in the number of such attacks prompted Israel to launch air strikes almost a month ago. Last Friday 13 of 61 rockets fired at Israel fell within Gaza, the Israeli foreign ministry said.

Golan and Globus became legendary figures in the global industry for their ability to conjure big hits from very low budgets, at least partly inspired by Golan\u2019s time working for Roger Corman in the early 60s. After making a string of films in Israel, which culminated in the surprise international hit Lemon Popsicle in 1978, Golan and Globus bought the ailing Cannon Group from its founders Dennis Friedland and Chris Dewey. Cannon became synonymous with its cheap-but-brash style, leading to the pair being dubbed \u201cthe Go-Go boys\u201d. Cannon was naturally drawn to the B-movie action movie which was then a profitable and popular genre: Golan and Globus made The Delta Force, Missing in Action, Invasion USA and Exterminator 2. (Sequels were also natural Cannon territory: they put out a string of notoriously shoddy follow-ups to Michael Winner\u2019s successful Death Wish.) They were also early-adopters of the comic-book and toy adaptation, releasing a Captain America movie as well as a film version of the Masters of the Universe toys. But their 1987 film Superman IV: The Quest for Peace proved a failure. However, they also boarded serious, artistically-aspirational films: they had producer credits on John Cassavetes\u2019 Love Streams, Andrei Konchalovsky\u2019s Runaway Train, and a film they distributed in 1986, The Assault, won an Oscar for best foreign language film. Golan also had a parallel career as a director, which was inevitably sidelined during Cannon\u2019s 1980s glory years. His best known directorial effort was probably Operation Thunderbolt, a 1977 production about the Israeli commando raid on Entebbe to free over 100 hostages held by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which received an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film. Prior to becoming a film-maker, Golan served in the Israeli air force during the 1948 war of independence.

In London a peaceful protest was organised by the Stop The War coalition. According to police, more than 20,000 people marched from the BBC&apos;s offices on Portland Place, via the US embassy to Hyde Park. Families with children and members of Jewish groups were among the demonstrators, who carried Palestinian flags and banners calling for an end to the civilian deaths in Gaza. The crowed chanted &quot;Free Palestine&quot; and &quot;Shame on you, Barack Obama&quot;, and a huge Palestinian flag was unfurled and held open for the benefit of the news helicopters above. Rime Hadri, 34, a public health worker and volunteer for Stop the War coalition, said she decided to participate in the march because the government had &quot;taken sides in the conflict&quot;. &quot;This has been ongoing for 60 years. I can see the injustice and inequality in this conflict,&quot; she said. Lou Everett, a probation officer, said: &quot;The US are sending arms to Israel; the UK&apos;s standing by, saying to Israel and Palestine &apos;you guys need to sort it out&apos;, whereas they need to be part of the solution.&quot; There were also demonstrations in Manchester, Edinburgh and Dublin, where several hundred people demonstrated for the fifth Saturday in a row. In South Africa an estimated 50,000 people took to the streets of Cape Town, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in what the authorities called the biggest post-apartheid rally the city has seen. Demonstrators called for peace and appealed to President Jacob Zuma and the South African government to stop selling arms to Israel. The demonstration in London comes in the wake of the chair of the parliamentary select committee on arms export controls, Sir John Stanley, writing to the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, requesting details of any UK military exports that may have been used by Israel to attack Gaza. On Friday night, Labour increased pressure on the government to suspend arms exports to Israel as the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, called for the publication of a Whitehall review of existing licences. Israel renewed strikes on Hamas on Saturday, with fighter jets carrying out 30 air raids, killing five Palestinians, after militants fired six rockets into the Jewish state. The most recent ceasefire ended on Friday morning, but combat has not resumed with the same intensity, fuelling hopes for a new truce. A US state department spokesperson said the Obama administration hoped that all parties would agree to another ceasefire. Pressure group Peace Now has called on supporters to rally on Saturday night in Tel Aviv against the conflict and to call for a diplomatic solution.A public appeal has raised more than \u00a34.5m in less than 24 hours to help the victims of Israel&apos;s attacks on Gaza. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) launched its Gaza crisis appeal on Friday night on all major UK television networks. The Department for International Development has matched the first \u00a32m donated by the public pound-for-pound. The funds will allow the committee&apos;s member agencies, such as Oxfam and the British Red Cross, to help the hundreds of thousands of Gazans needing clean water, food, shelter, medical treatment and psychological support. Saleh Saeed, DEC chief executive, said: &quot;The funds are desperately needed, with ongoing fighting in Gaza creating an unbearable situation for families and children. Despite the end of the ceasefire, aid is getting through ... but with the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, they urgently need more money.&quot; Meanwhile, the Foreign Office minister who resigned this week in protest over the government&apos;s &quot;morally indefensible&quot; position on the Gaza conflict said Britain&apos;s approach had been flawed for some time. Baroness Warsi told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme that her objections went beyond David Cameron&apos;s refusal to condemn Israel over the civilian death toll. Repeating her demand for an immediate suspension of arms exports to Israel, Warsi said there was no clear commitment from Britain to lead the international effort to keep both sides accountable. &quot;Our language was not there. It was lagging behind. I don&apos;t think it was just words that would have stopped me from doing what I did. I think it was a combination of issues. It was the language that we were using; I think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed.&quot; The Conservative peer said the government needed to &quot;move towards a Middle East policy that is in the long term sustainable&quot; and she cited the UK&apos;s decision to abstain when the UN general assembly voted in November 2012 to recognise a Palestinian state as symptomatic of the problems. &quot;There is no point in us talking about a two-state solution if we don&apos;t do the simple things like recognising Palestine in the way that the majority of the world has at the UN,&quot; she added. Warsi dismissed complaints that she had failed to condemn thousands of rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas, or the actions of Islamic extremists in Iraq. Her resignation meant she could &quot;live with myself&quot;, and she hoped it would bring together a &quot;broad coalition&quot; to address the issues behind the conflict.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-09T21:27:00Z", "title": "Gaza protests: rallies in UK and around the world call for end of conflict", "sentences": ["Pressure group Peace Now has called on supporters to rally on Saturday night in Tel Aviv against the conflict and to call for a diplomatic solution.A public appeal has raised more than \u00a34.5m in less than 24 hours to help the victims of Israel&apos;s attacks on Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/09/gaza-protest-march-london-raise-funds-victims-conflict-israel-palestine"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Israel", "UK news", "Sayeeda Warsi", "Politics"], "article": "A majority of British voters believe Israel acted in a disproportionate manner during the recent Gaza conflict, according to the latest Guardian/ICM poll, which lends support to the arguments that persuaded Lady Warsi to resign from the government. Amid hopes that the month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas could be ending as a ceasefire continued to hold, the poll also found greater opposition to Israel than to the Palestinians. The poll found that 52% of voters believe Israel acted disproportionately when it responded to the firing of rockets by Hamas by launching air strikes against the Gaza Strip. It found that 19% thought Israel had acted proportionately while 29% of those polled did not know. The findings will lend weight to the argument of Lady Warsi, who resigned last week as a senior Foreign Office minister after criticising David Cameron for his &quot;morally indefensible&quot; failure to describe the Israeli action as disproportionate. More than 1,900 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, have died in the conflict in which 64 Israeli soldiers have also been killed. Three civilians have been killed in Israel \u2013 two Israelis and a Thai agricultural worker. Nick Clegg endorsed some of Warsi&apos;s criticisms as he called for the suspension of arms export licences to Israel after he also described Tel Aviv&apos;s military response as disproportionate. The poll found that the conflict has hardened opinions against Israel, though the findings suggest there is unease about the actions of Hamas. According to the poll, 41% of voters say their opinion of Israel has worsened during the recent conflict. A larger number of voters (48%) say their opinion of Israel has remained the same. A fraction of voters (2%) say their opinion of Israel has improved while 8% say they do not know. A fifth of voters (21%) say their opinion of the Palestinians has worsened while just 9% say their opinion has improved despite widespread international condemnation of the Israeli actions and support for the plight of Palestinian civilians killed in the Israeli air raids. A clear majority of voters (60%) say their opinion of the Palestinians has not changed while 9% do not know. The poll asked voters about their views on &quot;the Palestinians&quot; \u2013 not distinguishing between Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and the Fatah faction of the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, which controls the West Bank. A unity government was agreed in June. Hamas is condemned by Tel Aviv and the US as a terrorist group bent on the destruction of Israel. The belief among a majority of voters that Israel acted in a disproportionate manner is likely to be highlighted by critics of Cameron, who believe the prime minister was wrong to prevent Tory ministers from using such language. In his letter to Warsi after her resignation, the prime minister described the situation in Gaza as &quot;intolerable&quot; as he raised concerns about &quot;the heavy toll of civilian casualties&quot;. But he said Israel had the right to defend itself. Hamas is estimated to have launched 3,000 rockets from Gaza in recent weeks.

After a day of conflicting reports about Egyptian mediators&apos; efforts to narrow the gap between the two sides, Ihab al-Ghossein, a senior Hamas official and spokesman in Gaza, said he was optimistic. &quot;This time at least it is a real negotiation. There is talking and discussion about all our points and hopefully we will have an agreement. I&apos;m optimistic there will be something,&quot; he said. Hassan Abdu, of the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, said there had been &quot;positive developments,&quot; though he warned that the two sides, who are talking in Cairo through Egyptian mediators, were still some way from a deal. An official from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said he too believed an agreement would be reached. A spokesman from Fatah \u2013 Hamas&apos;s factional rival \u2013 put the chances of peace at &quot;50-50&quot;. Though all said the negotiations were tough, the tone of the statements was very different from those made by officials in Gaza during the previous 72-hour ceasefire last week. At least 20 Palestinians died and two Israelis were injured in renewed airstrikes and rocket attacks after the last ceasefire \u2013 the seventh \u2013 expired on Friday. Israel broke off the talks after Hamas refused to extend the truce, saying it would not negotiate under fire. More than 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the month-long conflict so far. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed and three civilians have been killed in Israel. Tens of thousands of people have been made homeless in Gaza and around a quarter of the 1.8 million population of the overcrowded coastal enclave remain displaced. Israel has demanded the disarmament of Hamas, which took de facto control in Gaza in 2007 after winning Palestinian elections in 2006. An Israeli military source said that Israel saw the complete demilitarisation of Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza as being firmly on the table. &quot;We cannot come to Cairo and not [ask for] demilitarisation. Right now our stance is firm: we want to see Gaza demilitarised,&quot; he said. &quot;Israel is ready to live with Hamas in Gaza, but we are not ready to live with [a] Hamas with the ability to rearm again, to rebuild its military infrastructure.&quot; Despite rhetoric threatening renewed conflict on both sides, options for both Israel and Hamas are in fact limited. Hamas is isolated diplomatically and weakened financially. Israel&apos;s anti-missile defence systems have proved effective and the wave of popularity for the organisation that the war has prompted in Gaza may ebb fast. In Israel, many were surprised by the casualties sustained by troops who entered Gaza to seek and destroy cross-border tunnels. A new military operation involving a more ambitious deployment of ground forces into densely populated urban areas would be extremely costly for troops and civilians and would be likely to provoke global outrage. The talks centre on the lifting of the blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel eight years ago, the key demand of the 12-man Palestinian delegation. &quot;We are not making demands, we are looking for our rights: lifting the siege, opening our borders, implementing past agreements, releasing prisoners,&quot; said Ghossein. One key Palestinian demand is the construction of a sea port and reopening of an airport, as agreed in the Oslo agreements more than 20 years ago. &quot;We will not give Israel the security it wants until they lift the siege totally,&quot; said Abdu, of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Cairo-based diplomatic sources said the two sides were still some way from an agreement, and warned that a deal still may not be reached by the end of the current truce. Egypt, which brokered the three-day truce, has urged the warring sides to make every effort to reach &quot;a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire&quot;. Israeli media reported that Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had held separate meetings with hardline members of his coalition to convince them to accept the outlines of a deal. Netanyahu has said that the military operation \u2013 code named Protective Edge \u2013 would continue until Israel was guaranteed &quot;peace and security&quot;. Daniel Nisman, a security analyst for the Levantine Group in Tel Aviv, said Israel was willing to engage with most Palestinian demands. &quot;It&apos;s really too early to call these talks yet,&quot; said Nisman. &quot;Israel is really looking to play ball \u2013 with the exception of the airport. Many of us are quite puzzled about that \u2013 it&apos;s causing a lot of trouble here [in Israel]. It&apos;s seen as the equivalent of extortion.&quot; The Israeli military source said that discussion of a port and airport should be carried out in peace negotiations with the Palestinians as a whole - the latest round of which was abandoned earlier this year \u2013 and not in Cairo. Separately, it appears likely that Cairo will agree to ease restrictions on the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt&apos;s Sinai peninsula if Palestinian Authority forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas deploy along Gaza&apos;s border with Israel. The negotiations are taking place at the headquarters of Egypt&apos;s general intelligence directorate, which has brokered past ceasefires between Hamas and Israel. The Palestinians and Israelis sit in different rooms and never see each other, officials attending the talks said. There has been intense discussion in Cairo, officials in Gaza said, on whether issues such as the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails, most of whom are from Hamas, should be part of any overall deal or kept separate. Hamas is demanding the release of about 100 prisoners, including dozens of members of parliament, possibly in return for the remains of two Israeli soldiers. Another key issue is the flow of money into Gaza, currently blocked by Israel. It is believed that Israel had objected to a proposal from Qatar to move cash into Gaza to pay civil servants loyal to Hamas and for some reconstruction. A further contentious issue is the import of cement and other building supplies, which Israel fears could be used to construct more cross-border tunnels.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-12T19:29:02Z", "title": "Gaza: hopes rise of end to war as Hamas 'optimistic' of deal with Israel", "sentences": ["Daniel Nisman, a security analyst for the Levantine Group in Tel Aviv, said Israel was willing to engage with most Palestinian demands."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/gaza-war-hamas-israel-peace-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Egypt"], "article": "Hamas and Israel have agreed five more days&apos; truce to allow further talks after a tense final countdown to the end of the current 72-hour ceasefire on Wednesday night. The current truce, which is the eighth bid to end the five-week long war, had been due to expire at midnight, and rocket fire on Israel two hours before its end prompted fears of fresh violence. There was confusion immediately after the extension of the ceasefire was supposed to come into effect as well, with a series of rockets targeting southern Israel and Israeli military launching air strikes in Gaza in retaliation. Hamas, the Islamist organisation in power in Gaza, had earlier denied they had launched rockets. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either side. Gamal Shobky, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, told the Guardian shortly before midnight there would be a five-day ceasefire to give more opportunity for negotiation. &quot;We are very close but there are still some things to resolve.&quot; The news will be welcomed in Gaza, battered by a month-long conflict which inflicted massive damage on infrastructure and housing, as well as killing nearly 2,000 people, mostly civilians. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers died, and three civilians in Israel were killed by rocket fire. The two sides, talking through Egyptian mediators, appeared to have made progress during the three days of talks, although significant gaps remain between their positions, Palestinian officials in Gaza and Cairo said earlier in the day. Since the truce came into effect on Sunday, Israel has halted military operations in Gaza and groups based there including Hamas and several smaller Islamist organisations have stopped firing rockets. The most recent ceasefire was meant to give the two sides time to negotiate a more sustainable halt in hostilities with talks over a possible longer-term peace plan for the territory being postponed for later discussions. Continued violence would hinder humanitarian aid reaching Gaza and restrict food supply. Sanitation systems, electricity networks and roads have all been badly damaged in the war. Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Palestinian negotiation team in Cairo, blamed Israel for the failure to reach a permanent agreement. &quot;Because the Israeli delegation hasn&apos;t been in Cairo for the whole 72 hours, even though we&apos;ve been here, an agreement hasn&apos;t been reached,&quot; he said. &quot;We had two options: not to reach an agreement, or to extend the ceasefire. And in the final minutes we decided to extend the ceasefire by five days until Monday.&quot; The two sides were closer than ever, particularly on allowing more goods into Gaza, and on the rights of Gazan fishermen to fish in the Mediterranean, Ahmad said, but there were still points of difference, relating to &quot;security&quot; issues \u2013 a probable reference to Israel&apos;s demand that Hamas disarm \u2013 and the building of a seaport and airport in Gaza. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade since 2006 which has sent unemployment and poverty soaring. Easing, or entirely lifting, the blockade is a main aim for the Palestinians, and especially Hamas. Ahmad said the Palestinian delegation would now travel to the West Bank to consult with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, after 10 days in Cairo. The Israeli team has flown between Cairo and Tel Aviv every day. During the evening, a Hamas-run television channel in Gaza quoted Ismail Haniyeh, a senior political official in Hamas, pledging support for the delegation in Cairo. &quot;The threats of the enemy leaders only increase with our people&apos;s demands and the principal demand is the lifting of the blockade,&quot; Haniyeh said. The channel also broadcast images of Hamas fighters preparing rockets, which it said were still being made in Gaza. The seaport for Gaza, agreed in principle more than 20 years ago, has become a leading issue. If controlled by the Palestinians, it could transform the lives of Gaza&apos;s 1.8 million people who have been unable to trade and travel freely since Israel and Egypt imposed tight border restrictions in response to a Hamas takeover of the territory in 2007. But Israel is concerned a port would allow militant groups in Gaza to rearm. Hamas has recovered from previous rounds of violence with Israel, including a major three-week ground operation in January 2009 and another week-long air offensive in 2012. It now controls an arsenal of thousands of rockets, some with long ranges and powerful. More than 3,000 rockets have been fired toward Israel during the war. Currently only about 13,000 Gaza residents with special clearance, such as patients and traders, can leave the territory each month through land crossings into Israel and Egypt. Virtually all exports from Gaza are banned. It appears likely that Egypt will agree to ease restrictions on its border with Gaza if security forces from the Palestinian Authority take control of crossings. Both sides in the talks are under pressure to conclude a deal. Despite the rhetoric threatening renewed conflict, options for both Israel and Hamas are limited. Hamas is isolated diplomatically and weakened financially. Israel&apos;s anti-missile defence systems have proved effective and Hamas&apos;s popularity in Gaza prompted by the war could ebb quickly. In Israel, many were surprised by the casualties sustained by troops who entered Gaza to seek and destroy cross-border tunnels. A new military operation involving a more ambitious deployment of ground forces into densely populated urban areas would be extremely costly for troops and civilians and would be likely to provoke global outrage. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, spoke with the US president, Barack Obama, during the afternoon, Israeli media reported. Earlier on Wednesday, four police bomb disposal experts, an Italian reporter and a freelance Palestinian translator were killed when ordnance exploded in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. Simone Camilli, a 35-year-old video journalist working for the Associated Press news agency and Ali Shehda Abu Afash, 36, died when an unexploded 500kg bomb believed to have been dropped in an Israeli air strike exploded at a collection dump for munitions. &quot;You could hear the explosion five miles away,&quot; said Maher Halevi, chief of police at the Beit Lahiya station where the team were based. The war began on 8 July after a surge of rockets launched by Hamas on Israel. Israel blamed Hamas for the kidnapping and murder in June of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank. Israel later sent in ground troops to destroy Hamas&apos; underground cross-border tunnels. The Israeli military was reported to have called up additional reserve soldiers and reinforced troops along the border with Gaza on Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman told the Guardian that a number of reserves that had been on &quot;rest and recuperation&quot; had been called back up for active duty, but he would not reveal their numbers. A Palestinian Authority official speaking to mourners gathered at a funeral tent of a man killed by Israeli troops near Nablus in the occupied West Bank earlier this week said that the Palestinian delegation had been surprised by Egypt&apos;s hard line. Hamas officials in Gaza were also critical of the Egyptians. The organisation, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is seen by Cairo as a security threat. Jonathan Spyer, senior research fellow at the Global Research in International Affairs Centre in Herzliya, said that, for Israel, a deal which mirrors the Egypt ceasefire agreement tabled early in the conflict would be acceptable to the Israeli public. That deal was rejected by Hamas, which claimed it had never been shown it. &quot;Unless there were any major concessions to Hamas, the Israeli public will be happy to return to the stated goal of this operation \u2013 a return to peace and quiet,&quot; he said, adding that any deal that mirrored the 2012 ceasefire agreement would also be likely to play well in Israel. The public, he added, would even be likely to tolerate minor concessions in Gaza, such as an extension of its currently heavily restricted fishing zone or an opening of the border in Rafah with a checkpoint controlled by the Palestinian Authority, as was the case at Israel&apos;s Erez crossing with Gaza until the outbreak of the latest conflict. At the same time, Spyer said it was likely that Israel would be in the same situation six months to two years from now, given that its goal of demilitarisation in Gaza \u2013 or of the Palestinian Authority taking control of the strip \u2013 was unlikely to be achieved. &quot;I think Hamas will remain in power in Gaza. I can&apos;t see that changing,&quot; he said. Israel&apos;s hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that Israel must defeat Hamas even at the cost of another conflagration. &quot;Israel cannot afford a war of attrition,&quot; Lieberman said in a meeting with district heads in Bat Hadar. &quot;If the current ceasefire is heading towards collapse,&quot; Israel must &quot;take the initiative, even if it means a significant escalation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-08-13T22:48:00Z", "title": "Gaza conflict: Israel and Hamas agree to extend ceasefire by five days", "sentences": ["The Israeli team has flown between Cairo and Tel Aviv every day."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/gaza-conflict-israel-hamas-extend-ceasefire"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israel has banned young people from serving with one of its most prominent human rights groups because of its opposition to the war in Gaza. B&apos;Tselem, which campaigns against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, was informed on Wednesday night that it has been blacklisted as a civilian alternative to military service. The director of the body responsible for non-military options for Israelis who don&apos;t want to serve in the IDF, Sar-Shalom Jerbi, told Channel 2 TV that B&apos;Tselem had &quot;crossed the line in wartime [by] campaigning and inciting against the state of Israel and the Israel Defence Force, which is the most moral of armies&quot;. Hagai el-Ad, executive director at B&apos;Tselem, said that the move was the latest in a campaign of intimidation and threats against the organisation over the last three weeks, during which it has voiced vociferous opposition to the war in Gaza. It had tried to have the names of Palestinian children aired on state TV during Operation Protective Edge, but was denied. Its appeal to the high court of justice was rejected on Tuesday. &quot;The level of intimidation and the broadness of attacks on the organisation over the past three weeks is unprecedented in the 25-year history of B&apos;Tselem,&quot; Ad said, citing death threats and attempts to violently attack employees, as well as an organised internet campaign against the group. He said it was a trend that could apply more generally to Israeli society over the past month, where groups of rightwing Jews and ultra-nationalists have attacked peace rallies in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and there has been a surge in racism against Arabs in Israel. &quot;Until this day Arabs in Jerusalem are afraid of gang violence against them on the streets of this city. This has never happened before, and still remains the situation in Jerusalem,&quot; he said. B&apos;Tselem has called on Uri Orbach, the government minister in charge of the authority for national civic service and a member of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, that is in coalition with Binyamin Netanyahu, to overturn the decision, but the minister seemed to rule that out in a statement, published by Reuters. &quot;Israel is in the midst of a difficult military and diplomatic campaign against terrorists. An organisation that works to prove allegations that Israel is committing war crimes should be so good as to do so with its own resources and not with civilian national service volunteers and state funds,&quot; he said. Ad would not speculate on how the disqualification would affect B&apos;Tselem \u2013 the authority revealed that the group only has one civilian volunteer \u2013 as the organisation intends to fight the decision. All Israeli citizens have to carry out three years conscription when they turn 18, and all but a handful of young people choose to serve in the IDF. However, the Israeli government has been increasing alternatives to military service to accommodate Orthodox Jews and Arab Israelis, as well as pacifists.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-15T11:51:00Z", "title": "Israel bans national service with rights group B'Tselem in Gaza row", "sentences": ["He said it was a trend that could apply more generally to Israeli society over the past month, where groups of rightwing Jews and ultra-nationalists have attacked peace rallies in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and there has been a surge in racism against Arabs in Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/israel-btselem-service-aid-gaza-human-rights"}, {"tags": ["Gaza", "Anglicanism", "Christianity", "Religion", "London", "UK news", "Hamas", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "It wasn\u2019t exactly the French Riviera. But the beachside cafe did passable mezze. The waves lapped at the sand in that familiar holiday rhythm suggestive of sunscreen, ice-cream and novels. It was the Mediterranean, after all. Perhaps this is what they call a development opportunity, I idly mused to myself, sipping cold Coke. But the green Hamas flags\u00a0fluttering at regular intervals down the beach told a different story. This was, apparently, the land of terrorists \u2013 a word that remains so freighted with emotion that those labelled with it are deemed beyond human conversation. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk to terrorists\u201d is such a familiar political mantra that we tend to assume we know why we won\u2019t. But things change. And they change through talking. I mean, if former IRA boss Martin McGuinness can take part in a toast to the Queen at Windsor Castle, then anything\u2019s possible. Surely? Dr Anat Kurz meets me in her office at the Institute for National Security Studies, a part of Tel Aviv University, where she is the director of research and an expert on Hamas and terrorism. It feels a plugged-in, official kind of place. Justice minister, Tzipi Livni, had popped round earlier that morning. Dr Kurz pulls out a packet of thin white cigarettes and muses on the state of the Israel/Gaza conflict. We talk about talks. \u201cIsrael does not want to destroy Hamas,\u201d she says to my surprise, \u201cThere\u2019s a shift in the Israeli position.\u201d Several years ago, Israel\u2019s stated aim was to eradicate Hamas. \u201cBut now, Israel wants to leave Hamas enough capability because it is the most organised force in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Yes, she feels great bitterness towards Hamas. She speaks of the hundreds of children that have died digging tunnels, while Hamas bigwigs have villas and swimming pools. But better the devil you know. \u201cLook at the neighbourhood,\u201d she says. Whatever you think of Hamas, they are not as ideologically murderous as Islamic State (Isis). Hamas does not crucify the Christians of Gaza, for example. The word terrorist lumps all these groups together. But there is a difference between them that the emotions and the language of terrorism does not always allow. Indeed, Dr Kurz is reluctant to label Hamas as terrorists \u2013 she argues they are involved in a guerrilla war. And the lawless Egyptian Sinai, Israel\u2019s back yard, could easily become the next battleground for Isis. There is worse than Hamas out there. So much worse. Yes, the Hamas charter, drawn up in 1988, explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. Yes, it is antisemitic. But nonetheless, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal has claimed that the charter is \u201ca piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons\u201d. And Hamas number two, Mousa Abu Marzouk (with a PhD from Louisiana Tech), has gone ever further and called it \u201cdefunct\u201d: \u201cThe charter is not the Qur\u2019an. It can be amended.\u201d Maybe sincere, maybe not. But you don\u2019t get the impression that Isis would say anything like this. Nor indeed that Isis would be interested in participating in any sort of democratic process \u2013 remember Hamas won elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006. Whatever one thinks of the war in Gaza \u2013 no one knows how long the ceasefire will last \u2013 there can be no military solution for either side. It can only be achieved through talks. And talks that are genuinely intended to find political settlement. The demonisation of Hamas and indeed the demonisation of Israel does nothing to help these talks. The current war came about because of years of missed opportunities. And the label \u201cterrorism\u201d has regularly been used as an alibi not to talk. If there is to be any sort of peace, both sides have to think about each other differently. \u201cGaza could be Singapore,\u201d says Dr Kurz, doing precisely that.

A woman and a two-year-old boy \u2013 reported to be the wife and child of Mohammed Deif, Hamas\u2019s military chief, whom Israel has wanted to eliminate for years \u2013 died in an air strike on a house in Gaza City on Tuesday evening. A third unidentified person was also killed and at least 15 people injured. Hamas said the strike was an attempt to assassinate Deif and said Israel had opened a \u201cgateway to hell\u201d. Israel accused Hamas of violating the latest of a series of temporary ceasefires after rockets were launched from Gaza on Tuesday hours before the end of the latest truce, triggering a swift military and political response.  Seven members of one family, including a woman and three children, were killed when a house in central Gaza was hit early on Wednesday. The offices of the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa TV were also hit in at least 60 air strikes following the breakdown of the ceasefire. Hundreds of civilians fled their homes for UN shelters. Israeli officials said 70 rockets were fired from Gaza, the first of which were launched around eight hours before the truce was due to end at midnight. Hamas denied firing the first rockets but, following the deadly attack on the Gaza City house, it said it had fired at least 40 rockets, targeting Tel Aviv and Israel\u2019s main international airport, Ben Gurion. Iron Dome, Israel\u2019s vaunted anti-missile defence system, was reactivated, sirens sounded in the centre and south of the country, and bomb shelters within 50 miles (80km) of the Gaza border were reopened. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, ordered his negotiating team to leave talks in Cairo. \u201cThe Cairo talks were based on an agreed premise of a total cessation of hostilities,\u201d said the Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. \u201cWhen Hamas breaks the ceasefire they also break the premise for the Cairo talks. Accordingly the Israeli team has been called back as a result of today\u2019s rocket fire.\u201d It was not clear whether the team would return. Palestinian negotiators also left Cairo, blaming Israel for their failure. \u201cIsrael thwarted the contacts that could have brought peace,\u201d said chief Palestinian negotiator Azzam al-Ahmed. The Palestinians had presented a final set of demands, but Israel was \u201ctrying to impose what they want. This is impossible for us as Palestinians to accept that \u2026 the process of procrastination and stalling continues.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, issued a statement condemning the breakdown of the ceasefire, adding he was \u201cgravely disappointed by the return to hostilities\u201d and urging the sides not to allow matters to escalate. Gaza had been relatively quiet for the previous eight days under two successive ceasefires that allowed negotiations to proceed. A third 24-hour-long ceasefire \u2013 due to expire at midnight on Tuesday \u2013 was agreed in Cairo late on Monday night. It was unclear whether the renewed military action heralded a return to full-scale war or if the latest exchanges would be contained. The negotiations in Cairo have struggled to secure a long-term deal to end the six-week conflict as both sides have sought a formula that would allow them to declare positive results from the war. According to leaks, an outline agreement proposed by Egyptian mediators included the opening of crossings between Israel and Gaza, the import of construction materials under international supervision and the expansion of the permitted fishing zone to 12 miles over a period of six months.  The Palestinian demands for an airport and seaport, and the release of prisoners, would be deferred to further talks in about a month under the plan.  Israel wants the disarmament of Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, as well as the return by Hamas of the remains of two soldiers killed in fighting.  All Palestinian factions say the demilitarisation of Gaza is not up for negotiation. But Hamas publicly claims it is ready to share power in Gaza with the Palestinian Authority, which currently runs the West Bank.  More than 2,000 people \u2013 including almost 550 children \u2013 have been killed in fighting since 8 July and at least 10,000 have been injured, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Around 17,000 homes have been destroyed or severely damaged, along with scores of mosques, schools and hospitals.  A poll published by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 92% of Jewish Israelis believed the war was justified. Forty-eight per cent of those questioned thought an appropriate amount of force had been used by the Israeli military; 45% said too little force had been deployed; and 6% thought too much had been used. Israel has lost 64 soldiers in fighting, including five killed by friendly fire.

A day after peace talks in Cairo crumbled, Israeli air strikes pounded the strip and rockets rained down on Israel. As the death toll in Gaza rose well above 2,000 on Wednesday, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, compared the Hamas movement in Gaza to the Islamic State (Isis), calling the two groups a &quot;branch of the same tree&quot;. At a press conference on Wednesday night, Netanyahu said the Gaza war launched on 8 July &quot;will be a continued campaign&quot; aimed at restoring &quot;calm and safety&quot; to Israeli citizens. He said the latest bout of Israeli military action in Gaza was &quot;the harshest blow Hamas has taken since its foundation&quot;, but warned that if Hamas rocket fire continued, Israel would hit back &quot;sevenfold&quot;. &quot;This is a continuous campaign. The struggle against terror lasts for years,&quot; he said. The defence minister, Moshe Ya&apos;alon, added that Israel &quot;had killed hundreds of Hamas terrorists&quot; and would continue to do so. The UN security council expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; at the resumption of hostilities and called upon the parties to resume negotiations to urgently reach a &quot;sustainable and lasting ceasefire&quot;. The 15-member council also &quot;called upon the parties to prevent the situation from escalating and to reach an immediate humanitarian ceasefire&quot;. A Hamas spokesman said the peace process with Israel was dead, blaming an Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Tuesday night, which killed the wife and son of Hamas&apos;s military wing chief, Mohammed Deif. Israeli media suggested last night that Deif \u2013 one of Hamas&apos;s most senior figures and long a target of Israel \u2013 may also have been killed in the strike, but an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman declined to comment and Hamas denied the reports. Speaking at a press conference in Gaza City, Al Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida further upped the ante by warning of rocket attacks on Ben Gurion airport on Thursday, calling for airlines to suspend flights from 6am. He also told Israelis to avoid public gatherings and warned citizens in the country&apos;s south not to leave bomb shelters. Earlier on Wednesday, hundreds of Palestinians attended the funerals of Deif&apos;s wife, Vidad Asfura, 27, and son, Ali, in Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza. Hamas had urged Gazans to turn out in force for the funeral, but witnesses said that the thousands-strong crowds, militant presence and gunfire that often mark funerals in Gaza were conspicuously absent. Hundreds of civilians who had returned to their homes after eight days of relative quiet in Gaza fled back to UN shelters, as Israel called up thousands of reserve troops and massed tanks and armoured personnel carriers on the border. More than 60 Israeli air strikes pummelled Gaza, one killing seven members of the same family in central Gaza. The increased Israeli military presence in the south raised fears of a repeat of the IDF ground invasion of the strip earlier this month, during which dozens of Israeli soldiers were killed. Hawkish members of the Israeli cabinet on Wednesday repeated calls for an occupation of the Palestinian coastal enclave, which Israel evacuated under Ariel Sharon&apos;s leadership in 2005. Efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution to the conflict drew to a halt dramatically in Cairo as fire resumed on Tuesday evening, and showed no sign of restarting on Wednesday. Israel withdrew its delegation as soon as violence broke out and Hamas called for the Palestinian delegation to return home. Israel has blamed Hamas for breaking the ceasefire and triggering a resumption of violence with the firing of three rockets, which landed in open land near the southern city of Beersheba on Tuesday night. Within an hour, Israel had hit Deif&apos;s home with an air strike \u2013 an assault met with a volley of rockets from Gaza, most of which were shot down by Israel&apos;s Iron Dome anti-missile system. Sirens sounded over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time in weeks. Late on Wednesday, the IDF said around 140 rockets had been fired from Gaza since the breakdown of the talks, one of which hit a house outside Ashkelon. The Palestinians have blamed Israel for the failure of the truce and the return to violence. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation suggested in a statement that the rocket attack which provoked the Israeli withdrawal could have been manufactured by Israel as an excuse to abandon the talks. &quot;Israel \u2026 alleges that it was responding to three rockets launched from the Gaza districts \u2013 which supposedly landed in open areas and caused no deaths, injuries or damage,&quot; the PLO said in a statement. &quot;This launch has not been confirmed and no Palestinian resistance group has claimed responsibility. Israel has used the alleged rocket fire as a pretext for continuing to target Palestinian civilians.&quot; The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, was due to meet the Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, in Doha, Qatar, late on Wednesday, as the Palestinian Authority continues to try to steer the peace process. Hamas signed a deal with Fatah in April this year to set up a unity government, and the PA has taken the lead in talks between Israel and Hamas, who refuse to negotiate directly with each other. With the Sisi government in Egypt hostile to the Islamist leadership in Gaza, Hamas is looking to Qatar for diplomatic support. Michael Stephens, deputy director at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London, said: &quot;Qatar is basically Hamas&apos;s last ally.

He had been held by Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaida, since autumn 2012. His family released a statement thanking the US and Qatari governments for negotiating his release. &quot;While the family is not privy to the exact terms that were negotiated, we were repeatedly told by representatives of the Qatari government that they were mediating for Theo&apos;s release on a humanitarian basis without the payment of money,&quot; it added.

According to Aviv Oreg, a former al-Qaida specialist for Israeli military intelligence, Jabhat al-Nusra&apos;s motive in freeing Curtis was to distinguish it from even more radical Isis militants. &quot;I believe the main reason behind the release was to put Nusra in a different light from Isis, and was aimed at public opinion,&quot; he told reporters.

Books pile up in stacks like planes circling above Heathrow, waiting for months and months to be assigned a landing slot. Of course, publishers will clear the runway for a certified moneymaker and bring that in\u00a0early. But for most authors, there&apos;s a\u00a0minimum 12-month wait. The long lead time favours the scheduling of publication around big anniversaries \u2013 hence the battalions of\u00a0first-world-war books heading over the top right now into an increasingly murderous marketplace \u2013 but it&apos;s tough on writers who aim at being timely. David Bezmozgis reflects on that problem in a swiftly added afterword to his new novel, which is set in Crimea\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0territory that changed from Ukrainian to\u00a0Russian during the time between the typesetting of this book and its publication. He writes of\u00a0the mixed feelings he experiences at\u00a0the region&apos;s sudden claim on international attention. In a world of slow publishing and instantaneous news, he wonders, how can a writer have the chutzpah to write about the &quot;present cultural and political moment&quot; in fiction? His book illustrates the risks and the necessity of having that courage. The Betrayers tells the story of Baruch Kotler, a present-day Israeli politician. Fleeing a scandal, he seeks refuge with his younger mistress in the Black Sea resort of Yalta. It is nostalgia that brings Kotler back to Crimea at this moment of\u00a0crisis. Kotler is a Russian Jew with a more than passing resemblance to the real-life Israeli politician Natan Sharansky. Like Sharansky, Kotler is a former Soviet dissident who was imprisoned in the Gulag. Like Sharansky, he was freed and welcomed to Israel as\u00a0a hero. But after a successful political career, Kotler&apos;s refusal to agree to a planned withdrawal of Israeli settlements from the occupied territories has set him\u00a0at odds with opponents who are out to ruin him. Kotler is intransigent, uncompromising and therefore, the book suggests, heroic: he would rather have his reputation destroyed than concede his principles. And then, while he is on the run in Crimea, he unexpectedly meets the man whose testimony sent him to the Gulag 40 years previously. The dramatic intersection of the two men&apos;s destinies is the heart of\u00a0the novel, which raises questions of integrity, compromise, identity and\u00a0forgiveness. The Betrayers packs several lives into its 230 pages. It is a vivid re-creation of the hopes and betrayals of Soviet dissidents, and of the Jewish activists who left the USSR to live in Israel. It also describes the melancholy existence of the Jews who didn&apos;t leave: waning congregations in Black Sea synagogues surviving on stipends from American-Jewish charities. It is a great picture of the tawdriness of Yalta, the defeated hopes of an elderly population labouring under a kleptocracy. Kotler is a wry and pugnacious protagonist, with an iron-clad commitment to the Jewish cause that has been tempered in his struggle with Soviet tyranny. Like Sharansky, who resigned from the Israeli government in protest at the Gaza withdrawal in 2005, Kotler is a hawk. &quot;If you were not willing to protect your people,&quot; he reasons, &quot;you should not have encouraged them to live in that place, and if you were not going to encourage them to live in that place, you should never have held the territory \u2026 Now you stayed at any cost, or exchanged a pound of flesh with a pound of flesh.&quot; These thoughts go unchallenged in\u00a0the book. There is no gap between Kotler&apos;s assessment of himself and the book&apos;s opinion of him: Kotler and his author agree that he is funny, short, ugly, admirably intransigent, secure in his beliefs and identity. &quot;To be a Jew, one did not need to worship, only to be\u00a0suitably inflected. To resonate at the Jewish semitone.&quot; The smart writing registers no objection to what struck this reader as a kind of complacent essentialism. A tuning fork that can determine Jewish identity sounds like something dreamed up by a Nazi doctor. And while the Crimea Bezmozgis depicts has changed since he wrote the book, it&apos;s another set of recent headlines that prove more discomfiting. Reading The Betrayers at this point in 2014, it&apos;s not the Crimean details that seem odd, but a lack of inclusiveness in the book&apos;s vision of redemption.

There is a vacancy at Watford after Beppe Sannino surprisingly resigned on Sunday and Garc\u00eda, who left Maccabi Tel Aviv last week because of concerns over the security situation in Israel, is keen on a return to the Championship after spending last season at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He has held talks with Watford\u2019s Italian owners, the Pozzo family, and is expected to make a decision by Thursday. Leeds have made their interest in the 41-year-old Spaniard known after Dave Hockaday was sacked last week after only six games in charge. However Leeds lie 16th and although Garc\u00eda is impressed by their history, he is thought to be wary about joining a club which is not noted for providing managers with a stable environment in which to work. The Leeds owner, Massimo Cellino, was known in Italy as the \u201cmanager eater\u201d and sacked 36 managers during his 22 years at Cagliari. Cellino raised eyebrows this summer when he appointed Hockaday, whose previous managerial experience was limited to an unimpressive stint at non-league Forest Green Rovers. That uncertainty explains why Garc\u00eda feels that Watford, who are second in the Championship after a fine start to the season under Sannino, may be a better fit for him. Garc\u00eda is conscious that he has not stayed in any of his jobs for more than a season. After winning the Israeli title during his first spell with Maccabi in the 2012-13 season Garc\u00eda replaced Gus Poyet at Brighton and despite differences with the board at the Amex Stadium over what he felt was a lack of investment, he secured their spot in the play-offs in dramatic circumstances on the final day of the season. However Brighton\u2019s 6-2 defeat on aggregate by Derby County in the semi-final compounded Garc\u00eda\u2019s frustration and prompted him to hand in his resignation.

One realisation that has emerged from the current round of violence, and should be clear to any right-thinking person interested in a two-state future, is that Hamas today is the single greatest obstacle to the prosperity of Gaza, and in the longer run, to a peace agreement. The facts are there for everyone to see: Hamas is an internationally recognised terror group, which has earned that dubious title honestly, by virtue of dozens of suicide bombers, exploding buses and thousands of rockets. Its leaders sit in Qatar, its weapons smuggled from Iran, it trains alongside Hezbollah, and its ideology, clearly spelled out, is both radical Islamist and antisemitic. Its actions, as seen recently with the 18 executions of alleged collaborators with Israel in Gaza, resemble those of Isis and al-Qaida. Throughout its history, Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups have worked hard to derail the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians. At the height of the Oslo process, they blew up buses in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, sending suicide bombers to explode among Israeli civilians. It was then that the late prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said: \u201cWe must fight terrorism as if there\u2019s no peace process, and work to achieve peace as if there\u2019s no terror.\u201d Rabin\u2019s words hold true today, when an armed terror group has once again rained thousands of rockets from a strip of land which Israel had left almost a decade earlier in a bid to strengthen the chance for peace. Plans for an airport, a seaport and numerous joint Israeli-Palestinian projects in Gaza were in full swing when Hamas took over in 2006 and violently removed the Palestinian Authority, declaring it would not recognise Israel and proceeding to wage war on its civilians. Hamas control of Gaza has been an ongoing tragedy: for Palestinians, who have been subjected to an extremist regime which violates the rights of women, gays and other minorities, while using their resources \u2013 largely supported by the international community \u2013 for amassing rockets and building terror tunnels. For Israelis, Hamas\u2019s actions weaken the case for peaceful coexistence, providing a worst-case scenario that became a reality which would be catastrophic if repeated following a West Bank withdrawal. This week\u2019s international uproar following an Israeli declaration as \u201cstate land\u201d of 1.5 square miles in Gush Etzion \u2013 land that is under no private ownership and is destined to remain under Israeli sovereignty under any future agreement \u2013 is telling. Outrage, and action, should be directed at Hamas\u2019s extremist brand of terrorism, which remains the foremost stumbling block to any agreement. The wide support expressed by the Israeli public for the Gaza operation reflects the untenable situation of a country under constant rocket threat, a reality not experienced in Europe since the second world war. This support mirrors the growing realisation, reflected throughout the region, that radical elements left to their own devices do not become moderate of their own accord; rather they are supported by their friends and allies, and become stronger and more audacious. Peace is achieved by strengthening moderates while actively pursuing the isolation of extremists, using diplomatic as well as military means. As Hamas leaders stand amongst the rubble of Shuja\u2019iya, brandishing weapons and proclaiming victory and continued jihad, at least one thing is clear: until it is stopped, peace may well elude us, and so long as it remains in power, the real losers will be Israelis and Palestinians who long for a radically different, peaceful future.", "publicationDate": "2014-09-03T15:01:13Z", "title": "Hamas is the single biggest barrier to peace in Gaza | Yiftah Curiel", "sentences": ["At the height of the Oslo process, they blew up buses in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, sending suicide bombers to explode among Israeli civilians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/hamas-biggest-barrier-peace-gaza-extremist-regime-palestinians-israelis"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "Judaism", "Religion", "Holocaust", "Second world war", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "Hamas"], "article": "I do not need Michael Gove to explain to me what antisemitism is (Gove attacks \u2018antisemitic\u2019 Israel boycotts, 10 September). I have been the object of antisemitism by two Conservative MPs, Sir Charles Taylor, who told me to \u201cGet back to Tel Aviv\u201d, and Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who admonished me that my loyalty should be to this country and not to Israel, bringing the proceedings of the House of Commons to a roaring halt. Harold Macmillan referred to me antisemitically in his diaries. Of course the Holocaust, the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews, including many members of my family, was an atrocity unparalleled in human history. That does not provide justification for the Israelis murdering thousands of Palestinians. Since governments take no action against these massacres, it is right that communities and individuals should boycott Israeli products.Gerald Kaufman MPLabour, Manchester Gorton \u2022 Mr Gove creates the all-too-common (and deliberate?) confusion between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign (BDS) is symbol of opposition to the policies of the state of Israel\u2019s policies, in relation to the occupation, the continued building of settlements, the imprisonment of children and the murderous attacks on Gaza. There should never be any devaluation of the Holocaust, and antisemitism should always be resolutely resisted. Very unfortunately some protesters also confuse antisemitism and anti-Zionism. Where Mr Gove is right is that \u201cwe need to stand united against hate\u201d \u2013 but that of course includes Palestinians, and even Hamas, who are at least partially a product of Zionism. BDS should continue and grow, including a total arms embargo, until Israel is willing to seriously negotiate with all Palestinians, including Hamas. That was how the original apartheid state was brought to the table, with the hated ANC, and that is what needs to happen again.Rev David HaslamEvesham, Worcestershire \u2022 Michael Gove needs to be reminded that one case is not a reliable basis for generalisation. Yes, the Nazi boycott of Jewish goods was followed by the Holocaust but the campaign against South African apartheid was not followed by the mass killing of whites. He also needs to be more careful in his assertions: the Tricycle theatre did not reject \u201cIsraeli money\u201d because it came from Israel but because it came from the government of Israel, which is instrumental in the denial of Palestinian human rights and the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. The Palestinian call for the boycott of Israel is absolutely clear in its opposition to all forms of racism.Professor David E PeggYork \u2022 Antisemites and defenders of Israel seem united in the delusion that opposition to Israel means hatred of Jews. Most people, I hope, can see the difference. Responsible politicians and commentators should make it clear that many Jews and non-Jews are critical of Israel\u2019s policies without being antisemitic, and not fuel this dangerous fallacy.Caryl ChurchillLondon \u2022 Avi Shlaim (Israel will find wisdom when it admits its mistakes, 8 September) shamefully glorifies a designated terror group whose fighters, according to him, have \u201creasons for rejoicing\u201d, for standing firm while their \u201cspirit did not break\u201d. Shlaim admits that Hamas \u201cis guilty of terrorism\u201d, yet says it should not be labelled as terrorist, because it is \u201calso a legitimate political actor\u201d. This argument makes little sense, and did not convince the European Union last year when it designated Hezbollah as a terror group, despite its role in the Lebanese government. Terror groups should be isolated, not \u201clet off the hook\u201d, as demonstrated just a few days ago when the president of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, harshly criticised Hamas for the group\u2019s responsibility in instigating the Gaza conflict. It seems that while both Palestinians and Israelis are seeing the situation for what it is \u2013 a conflict between moderates and radical terror \u2013 Shlaim\u2019s piece reflects an outdated narrative that is not only anti-Israeli but arguably anti-Palestinian.Yiftah CurielSpokesperson, embassy of Israel, London \u2022 Avi Shlaim\u2019s excellent article explains why Israel\u2019s current policies cannot bring it peace or security. The article\u2019s flaw is the unspoken assumption that Israel wants peace and security. Since 1948, Israel\u2019s aim has, demonstrably, been ever greater expansion by means of dispossessing Palestinians. The map of military conquests and settlements in the West Bank, including down the Jordan Valley, show over time how well that aim has been realised \u2013 and continues to be realised. Israel wants not peace and security but Palestinian, Arab and world acquiescence in this continual expansion. The various \u201cpeace processes\u201d have nothing to do with peace and everything to do with providing a smokescreen to this end.Mike DaviesChair, Alliance for Green Socialism \u2022 While the author\u2019s intentions are no doubt good, articles such as this are detrimental to the cause of peace. Mr Shlaim admits that \u201cHamas is indeed guilty of terrorism\u201d and that it \u201cvehemently denies the legitimacy of Israel\u201d. Surely, conferring any sort of political legitimacy to such an organisation (as the author suggests) would only reward terrorism, while weakening those Palestinians more amenable to a peaceful solution. Hamas \u2013 which has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide bombings \u2013 is no more \u201ca legitimate political actor\u201d than Isis, al-Qaida, al-Shabaab or Boko Haram. Peace has never been achieved by empowering extremists, or by placing demands on just one side; but by working with the moderates in both camps. Both sides need to recognise that this is a conflict of right v right, not right v wrong; that both peoples are there by right, not sufferance. This is key: once this is recognised, mutual concessions, accommodation and respect become the self-evident next steps.Noru TsalicCoventry \u2022 I am a Jew, committed to the Jewish religion and the ethical values of justice, mercy and compassion. As such, I deplore the Israeli aggression against the people of Gaza. I hope that the present ceasefire will eventually lead to a wider agreement. It has come to my attention that the deputy lord mayor of Cardiff, Cllr Ali Ahmed, has been reported to the south Wales police by the Liberal Democrat opposition, on the grounds that he referred to rockets fired by Hamas against Israel as \u201ctoy rockets\u201d and that this reference was offensive to the Jewish community. It would have been preferable, that instead of using the words \u201ctoy rockets\u201d, he has said that \u201cthe damage done by Israel is not comparable with the Israeli bombing on the people of Gaza\u201d; that may have been more explanatory. However, the sentiments that he expressed are the sentiments shared, not only by many Jews like myself but also of some Israelis with regard to their own government. There is no need for the deputy lord mayor to resign. He is a man who has a strong commitment to ethical principles.Walter WolfgangFormer member, Labour party NEC; vice-president, CND; national steering committee member, Stop the War Coalition \u2022 One night, when I was 13, I was woken by the sound of a door being broken down. Boots stumbled up the stairs, there was loud shouting, and a terrifying series of crashes. Nazi stormtroopers had identified our house as the home of a Jewish family, and this was the night of 9 November 1938, when the Kristallnacht pogrom raged across Germany. Our entire home was destroyed before our eyes, with axes and sledgehammers. I have a vivid recollection of my father, after the monsters had gone, sitting on the one chair that remained and weeping. I had never seen him weep before. I now realise that, but for the presence of myself and my younger sister, my parents might not have survived the raid. It was a brutal demonstration of our situation. My sister and I left Germany on the last Kindertransport from D\u00fcsseldorf in May 1939. We have never had a full account of our parents\u2019 fate. Even now, I sometimes start up in bed, reliving that night. But in recent weeks, it is more often images of devastation in Gaza \u2013 of homes and families destroyed in Israeli targetings of such \u201cmilitary objectives\u201d as the homes of officials in the democratically elected Hamas government \u2013 that have recalled the terror of the Kristallnacht. For I can hardly believe that a Jewish government is doing these things. How can Jewish people, aware of their own history, undertake a campaign of collective punishment that kills a higher multiple of the casualties cited as justification, than did the Nazi reprisals for resistance in occupied Europe? Surely we have reached the point where every government not composed of utter humbugs must join in insisting that an Israeli renunciation of ambitions for expansion beyond the 1947 boundaries is a prerequisite for progress towards reconciliation and peace within a two-state solution. The very doubtful prospect of a unified, multinational, secular state in Palestine appears to be the only alternative.Karola RegentNewport-on-Tay, Fife \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September.

They are all members of Unit 8200 \u2013 known in Hebrew as Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim \u2013 Israel\u2019s largest signals intelligence gathering unit, active both abroad and in the Palestinian territories. All three are now on the active reserve list and have said they will not do reserve service relating to the occupied Palestinian territories. Of the three, \u201cA\u201d, aged 32, and Nadav, 26, are sergeants, while \u201cD\u201d, 29, is a captain. By agreement with the letter\u2019s signatories, material relating to specific claims regarding the unit was provided in statements that they chose to disclose to the Israeli military censor. In face-to-face interviews they agreed to discuss what motivated them to sign the letter, declining to discuss specifics. Below is a transcript of the Guardian\u2019s interview conducted earlier this week in collaboration with several other media outlets. It has been lightly edited for repetition, brevity and sense. Two minor amendments were made at the request of the soldiers to clarify meaning. How did you organise the letter? D: For a couple of months friends [have been] joining and [it\u2019s been] growing slowly \u2026 most of them are still active. We\u2019ve been thinking about it for maybe a year. It was a difficult dilemma. We were worried that this action would be seen only as a response to the war in Gaza and it is important to us to make it clear this is about the \u2018normal\u2019 situation [of the occupation]. A: We didn\u2019t want it to be interpreted only in this context. We decided before the recent war to do this. For me there wasn\u2019t any particular trigger. It was a long process of realising \u2026 When people talk about the role that intelligence services play in non-democratic regimes usually their hair stands on their back a bit and they shudder. And that\u2019s not the way I thought about the military service that I did [at first]. It was a gradual realisation that this was me [as well]. That I was playing that role. That made me see in a different light what I\u2019ve done and take this action. I still feel very committed to how I was raised, and that\u2019s what makes it so difficult. I still feel part of [Israeli] society. N: I think because we are part of [Israeli] society is the reason [that] we are doing it. It is not an act against everything that is done \u2026 A: We feel it as an act of taking responsibility for the things we take part in. But we also see it as part of a deep concern for the society we live in. We\u2019re not trying to break away from it or anything like that. Maybe you can say something about yourselves? D: I currently live in Jerusalem. I\u2019m a student. I\u2019m doing a master\u2019s in computers. I joined the military in 2003. I stayed until 2011. I was an officer. An intelligence officer. And I stayed for a couple of years extra. I was a team leader, then a section leader. A captain. A: I was enlisted in 2001 after half a year of pre-military courses which I volunteered for. Afterwards I also stayed on for an extra period. I volunteered to become an instructor and then a team leader. Full time I was [there] five years. Since then I\u2019ve been a student also in the Hebrew University. Now I live in Tel Aviv and my wife and I are expecting our first daughter. I\u2019m studying maths. N: I enlisted in 2007. I was in the army for almost four years. I was also an instructor. I finished the military in 2010. Now I live in Tel Aviv. I\u2019m a student in the Open University and I\u2019m studying literature and philosophy. When you think about intelligence work, people think about it as \u201cclean\u201d because it\u2019s not about running after people in alleys of refugee camps and shooting at protesters. What\u2019s not \u201cclean\u201d about intelligence work that you wouldn\u2019t want to be involved in? N: The intelligence gathering on Palestinians is not clean in that sense. When you rule a population \u2026 they don\u2019t have political rights, laws like we have. The nature of this regime of ruling over people, especially when you do it for many years, it forces you to take control, infiltrate every aspect of their life. D: [This is] one of the messages we feel it is very important to get across mostly to the Israeli public because that is a very common misconception about what\u2019s intelligence and I can say for myself and for many of the participants \u2013 refuseniks in our letter \u2013 that this is something [we also felt] when we were enlisting in the military. Not being aware of the conflict as much as we are aware of it today \u2026 [believing] our job was going to be minimising violence, minimising loss of lives. That made the moral side of it feel \u2013 be \u2013 much easier. A: I distinctly remember before I was recruited, I felt very fortunate that I had this job that was so clean of moral dilemmas. [Because] our job was to make the work smarter. We were supposed to minimise the casualties both fighting terrorism. And when Israel is forced to strike back, we would be able to make sure only the bad guys get killed. And I think recent events \u2026 but this is not just about the recent war [in Gaza] \u2026 our experience after the past 10 years have made us see this is simplistic. N: In the last month there were two occasions of this in newspapers that reflect this [point] exactly. There was a [Palestinian] parliament member in Ramallah. The army told her she had to move to Jericho because she was supporting demonstrations. That\u2019s just one example of the things intelligence does that is not really to do with terrorism or anything like that. D: A significant part of what the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] does is not the \u201ctitle\u201d [ie defence]. The \u201ctitle\u201d of what the IDF does in the occupied territories is ruling another people. One of the things you need to do is defend yourself from them, but you also need to oppress the population. You need to weaken the politics, you need to strengthen and deepen your control of Palestinian society so that the [Israeli] state can remain [there] in the long term \u2026 We realised that that\u2019s the job of the intelligence. Was there work they did not object to? D: I think a lot of what the unit does, doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Palestinians, we\u2019re not only not against that, we\u2019re all in favour, we think it is the right and duty of the state of Israel to defend its citizens. We took that very seriously while we were in the unit and we still take it seriously. That\u2019s what makes this decision much more difficult because it\u2019s not a black and white situation. Did you feel your were violating people\u2019s rights? N: Definitely. In Israeli intelligence regarding Palestinians, they don\u2019t really have rights. Nobody asks that question. It\u2019s not [like] Israeli citizens, where if you want to gather information about them you need to go to court. A: The only limitation is the limitation of resources. There\u2019s no procedural questions regarding who can and cannot be surveilled. Everybody is fair game. N: An 18-year-old soldier who thinks: \u201cWe need to gather information on this or that person\u201d \u2013 that 18-year-old kid [in Unit 8200] is the one that decides. A: It is well known that the intelligence is used. People are arrested in the Palestinian territories. Sometimes without trial. And even when they are taken to trial it\u2019s often with evidence that can\u2019t be exposed [in court] because it is classified. And the intelligence is used to apply pressure to people, to make them cooperate with Israel. These are all things that are known. It\u2019s no secret that Israeli intelligence is producing the target database that is used in the air strikes \u2026 There was a big media outcry after [Hamas military leader] Salah Shehade was assassinated [in 2002] and 14 members of his family were killed. There was a big story around that and the commander of the air force then \u2013 Dan Halutz \u2013 said to the pilots: \u201cYou did well.\u201d You\u2019re not responsible. Your job is to deliver the ammunition to the target in the most professional and accurate way you can, and you did that and your hands are clean. D: And you don\u2019t see the big picture \u2026 A: The question [is] who does see the big picture? Who does provide this information to these pilots? And the answer is clear [ie Unit 8200]. [There was] a famous incident. It was when \u201cLieutenant Alif\u201d [Lieutenant A, a former member of their unit] refused to pass on information regarding the capacity of a building. The idea was to destroy a building and its inhabitants \u2013 and what I\u2019m telling is not the story we were told in the unit \u2013 it was a story that was exposed by journalists in Israel years later. D: In 2003 [during the second intifada] there was this general routine for the IDF to bomb buildings at night as a response to terrorist attacks or to pass a message or \u2026 whatever you like. After an especially bad terrorist attack in south Tel Aviv by the old bus station there was a decision that the response had to be more harsh this time. The action that was decided upon was to destroy from the air a building belonging to Fatah, which wasn\u2019t the organisation that was responsible for the terrorist attack. And the building wasn\u2019t related in any way to military activity. It was some kind of welfare centre where they were giving out pay cheques. Unlike previous times, an essential part [of the operation] was that building wouldn\u2019t be empty and there would be people there, no matter who. Someone had to be there in order to die. The role of our unit was to give the green light for this attack. To say when the building isn\u2019t empty. So this lieutenant \u2013 whose name wasn\u2019t published \u2013 refused. At first he tried to get the action cancelled. And then he spoke with his commanders but still found himself in real time being asked for that information. And even when he knew that now the building is not empty and was supposed to give the green light he said: \u201cI\u2019m refusing, I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d He got the operation cancelled. The response of all the senior commanders \u2013 in the unit and in the military \u2013 was to be shocked by him daring to refuse a direct order that he had received. That was the only kind of inquiry that was taken into the matter. There were some reports \u2013 just days after the incident, in the Israeli media \u2013 but they were wrong. They changed the goal of the operation and said the goal was a targeted killing of \u2026 A: I remember that it was the talk of the unit because it was in the news and we all had briefings about it. We were told he was \u201cconfused\u201d. He didn\u2019t understand what was asked of him. And the general message was there\u2019s no such thing as a manifestly illegal order in the unit. D: What\u2019s important is that it wasn\u2019t only the interpretation \u2026 the media and soldiers inside the unit were told a lie about what was the target of the operation. \u2026 The [fact that] the ultimate goal was to kill innocent people was hidden. I joined the unit several months after. The response was to kick [the lieutenant] out of his job \u2013 not the unit \u2013 until he finished his military service. I received a lesson in the course where we discussed this [case]. As a person who spent many years in the unit, who took my job there very seriously, I was very motivated to be a part of this unit and to do our job and I feel very betrayed by this lie. I feel the worst thing about it is, it isn\u2019t the momentary decision of a completely illegal, immoral operation, but the fact that for more than a decade later the unit still prefers not to deal with it \u2026 N: To deny what really happened \u2026 D: \u2026 to say that according to senior officers this operation was looked into before the order was given. Legal officers checked the order to make sure it was an OK operation to carry out. So according to these senior officers this was all OK. There was no problem. When they were asked in [this article] in 2011 they could not even understand what was the issue. They say \u201cLeave us alone\u201d to the reporter. A: But you talked to the people who were there \u2026 D: I did speak with people who were there. I don\u2019t want to say exactly who. People who were in the room \u2026 A: The reason I brought up the whole Lieutenant Alif case was to emphasise that on the one hand the pilots are not responsible and on the other hand we \u2013 who are providing the information \u2013 are not responsible. The feeling is that it\u2019s never possible to point any fingers. There is no one who is responsible. N: And when you look at what happened this summer when building after building was destroyed on the inhabitants and hundreds of innocent people were killed. No one raised an eyebrow as opposed to just one decade ago when a killing of a family of a commander of Hamas [Salah Shahade] \u2013 then people were shocked. It was a huge story in Israel. D: The story [of Lieutenant Alif] is very important and representative of the response of senior commanders of the unit to this incident I was referring to. [The fact] that the incident is used to give soldiers in the unit the message: \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as a definite illegal order. And we think this message has been well understood in the unit, which we think is a part of the fact that in the recent decade we\u2019ve seen a decline in how much the soldiers and the Israeli public cares that innocent people are dying. A: It\u2019s important to say, the reason I decided to refuse. I decided to refuse long before the recent [Gaza] operation. It was when I realised that what I was doing was the same job that the intelligence services of every undemocratic regime are doing. That I\u2019m part of this large mechanism that is trying to defend or perpetuate its presence in the [occupied territories] \u2026 N: \u2026 it is part of the effort to save the status quo. A: To preserve and hold and deepen our hold on the Palestinian population. And I think for most of us this was the main reason for doing this. And of course the operations and the wars \u2013 the ongoing periodic wars are part of this. How did the letter come about? D: At first it was just a small group of people meeting and discussing both our political opinions and also going through a process of realising what we\u2019ve been involved with. You have to understand that being in the unit is very, very secret. It is not only that we keep secrets from the outside but we keep secrets from each other. The whole culture is very secretive. It is very difficult to just be in a situation where you meet with each other to reach a position of productive discussion. So for all of us just coming out with our thoughts was in itself very difficult. Slowly we discussed it with more friends \u2013 with friends from the unit we thought would be interested \u2013 and just expanded it. A: You sort of feel around to see how people feel about doing reserve service. D: First when we approached people we didn\u2019t say: \u201cLook this is our plan, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201d A: I should say there are a lot of people who, when they leave the military service they start seeing Palestinians as people not just as sources of information, and getting a bigger picture of what\u2019s happening and a lot of people \u2026 there\u2019s very different levels of commitment and enthusiasm in doing the reserve service and a lot of people taper off. D: It was clear from the beginning we wanted to do everything legally. We went to a lawyer and said we don\u2019t want to commit an offence or say anything not allowed to can you help us figure out what we would be allowed to say. N: We\u2019re not telling secrets about what we did or the way the unit works. We don\u2019t want to do that. We don\u2019t want to hurt national security, we just want to say what is wrong with the things we did and the unit does. We want people to know that being in intelligence is not clean, and to control a population of millions you can\u2019t just do counter-terrorism and hurt the people who want to hurt you. D: I think another aspect is the personal aspect. Our decision as individuals that we morally can\u2019t continue to participate in these actions in military service. In theory there is the option of just avoiding the service, not going public but that brings me to \u2013 if I had to answer the question what are we doing this for \u2013 for me, it is to take responsibility. I am very acutely aware that I was a part of the cycle of violence, in perpetuating it. I feel like in many moments in this long process I felt maybe just drop it. Maybe just forget about it. You can be leftist, you can go to demonstrations if you want. But I realised that is running away from responsibility because I am already a part. I\u2019ve been a part for almost eight years of these actions that I disagree with. What at the personal level influenced each of you? D: During my military service, especially during my last years, I advanced through the ranks and I understood more about what is happening. About the unit\u2019s role in the occupied territories. That was one stage. After I left in 2011 it the summer of the famous social protests, and I think that was a moment of political awakening for a lot of people despite quite a lot of cynicism in Israel about the impact of that. I felt it put me in a more responsible and involved mindset. I had questions from my military service I couldn\u2019t really deal with. But it was my whole life. My friends, my daily job. I wasn\u2019t in a position where I could question then properly \u2026 Then I went back to things I was involved in. Thought about it. That was a bit of a Pandora\u2019s box to open because I felt the moment I asked myself these questions I couldn\u2019t run away from responsibility. Another important realisation for me was that our unit was the intelligence side of an oppressive military regime [in the occupied territories]. Realising it in those terms also brought it much closer to me because my dad was Argentinian, and he was imprisoned by the military dictatorship in 1977. I think this comparison \u2013 and that\u2019s not at all to say the actions of this Argentinian dictatorship is at all similar [to Israel] \u2013 but it\u2019s this realisation that we were imagining Palestinians as just plain enemies. We didn\u2019t realise there was a difference between [the Palestinians we rule over] and citizens of any other country that is the enemy of Israel. My hard realisation was when I realised our function is both to be the regime and also to gather this intelligence \u2026 It isn\u2019t like a military issue where you need to know how many airplanes the enemy has. The targets of this intelligence are specific people and the consequences that this intelligence have are very, very serious and encompass many different areas of their life, because it is also [gathered] by the same regime that controls their lives. And in this aspect it is the same thing as the dictatorship in Argentina that imprisoned my dad. A: I identify with a lot of what D said. We are told, and we like to think about Palestinians as enemies in a symmetrical conflict. I started going on tours in Hebron and around Jerusalem and I started to see the reality of the people living there. And you are basically providing them with water and electricity. And you give them job permits. On the one hand, you decide whether they can work their land or not. And on the other hand, they don\u2019t want you there. And in this complicated situation you are bound to be drawn to do the all-encompassing surveillance that D has talked about. I\u2019m the person who is doing it \u2026 [and I came to] see myself in the light of other oppressive regimes and the role that intelligence plays in these regimes was the turning point. N: I have to say I was very proud when I first enlisted. I thought it was a very important unit. I am still proud of some things that I did there. I\u2019m not saying that everything done is wrong. The thing that led me to take this decision is that during my service I started realising that we don\u2019t only do things meant to ensure the security of Israel in the sense that these people want to hurt us, but more and more to do with innocent people. There were times when I raised the question with my fellow soldiers in the unit, with the commanders, that maybe some things were wrong. The answer I was given all the time was: \u201cNo, it\u2019s OK.\u201d These questions kept arising in my head. Now as the years go by, and I see it from the outside, I realise that there are some things that are really problematic. Intelligence can be gathered about everyone. A: It\u2019s not just a procedural objection that we have. It is the deeper issue that we are part of a regime that is denying Palestinians their rights. It\u2019s been going on for almost 50 years. D: The problem is that we realised what the actual role of the unit is, that\u2019s what we are bothered about. We don\u2019t think fixing the legal procedures a bit or caring a bit more about Palestinians would be a solution. We think it is a cause of the unit of the job. A: I think we have said that some of the things that the IDF does really does deserve the title defence forces, but there is a significant proportion of what it is doing that does not deserve this title. It\u2019s in the interests of perpetuating a regime that is oppressive. That is not democratic. It is these things we are trying to bring to the attention of Israeli public first and foremost. To create a discussion and think critically about it. So you won\u2019t serve across the Green Line in the occupied territories? D: That is the exact parallel. It\u2019s important to us, if it was up to us, our full names would be on the [published] letter. We are not allowed to reveal it because of secrecy laws. When you look at [things] in terms of intelligence you can broadly say that there are two types of intelligence in the world. One is gathered \u2013 say in a democracy \u2013 that a regime collects against its citizens. For example, as an Israeli the government might collect intelligence on me but it has severe limitations on how to do that, and the way that it can use it against me is very limited. Even if it is taken to court in the end if there is a punishment it is only a punishment directly related to the offence I committed. So that you can, if you like, call civil intelligence. Then there is military intelligence, which a country collects on another country. Then there\u2019s no laws governing that, only diplomacy and international relations. That\u2019s intelligence. It\u2019s pretty dirty. But that\u2019s the inherent rules of the game. The other country can defend itself to some extent. In most cases this kind of intelligence won\u2019t have direct consequences for the actual civilian citizens in the other country that might be the target of this intelligence. [But] in this situation, what\u2019s common to the Palestinian situation \u2013 and the situation in Argentina [under the military dictatorship] \u2013 is that people get the worst of the two types of intelligence. On the one hand, there are no rules about collecting the intelligence, but at the same time this intelligence might have severe consequences regarding all areas of their life. You realise that this might have consequences for you \u2013 socially and for future employment? You might pay a price for this? N: This is a price I\u2019m willing to pay. This is very important. You can\u2019t run from responsibility. D: It\u2019s a serious dilemma for a lot of people I know who decided not to sign the letter. One of the main reasons was this: everyone of us sees the risk a bit differently.

The ferocity of the response was not unexpected by those involved. One signatory told the Guardian before publication that he feared being portrayed as an enemy of the state after the letter was made public. Among those who have criticised the reservists&apos; actions are Israel&apos;s prime minister, the president, opposition leaders and a former intelligence head. In addition, the Israeli military revealed that 200 other members of the unit had signed a counter-letter defending its work. The reservists&apos; letter had alleged the intelligence unit undertook &quot;all-encompassing&quot; surveillance of the Palestinians \u2013 whether involved in terrorism or not \u2013 and used information, including on sexual orientation, to blackmail individuals into becoming informants. The threat of criminal sanctions would break the pattern of the treatment of reservists, including pilots, who signed previous refusenik letters who have tended to be discharged. It is not clear, however, what charges the men and women could face. The 43 took legal advice from a prominent lawyer to ensure their letter and testimonies did not break the law, including by revealing their identities. The text of the letter and most serious allegations were also submitted to the Israeli authorities before publication on Friday. Since the letter was published on Friday as well asThe letter, published with testimonies from reservists of Unit 8200, claimed much of its electronic interception work was being used to support the &quot;political persecution&quot; of Palestinians and the continued occupation. As a deluge of criticism of the protesters poured from senior Israeli politicians and officials, it was disclosed that the current commander of 8200 had sent a letter to members of the unit \u2013 that does interception work analogous with the US NSA or the UK&apos;s GCHQ \u2013 warning them against rising complaints with the media, saying that any ethical concerns could be dealt with adequately by commanders within the unit. Leading the charge against the refusniks on Sunday was the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Speaking at a cyber-security conference in Tel Aviv, he accused the soldiers of &quot;baseless slander&quot; adding: &quot;This is an act that should be condemned \u2026 and that constitutes political exploitation of the Israel Defence Forces [IDF]. &quot;The IDF is the most moral army in the world and it carries out the missions that we give it to safeguard our security. From my long years of acquaintance with the members of Unit 8200, the baseless slander levelled against them will not harm the vitally important work they do for the nation&apos;s security. And I say to them \u2013 continue.&quot; Netanyahu&apos;s comments came as an IDF spokesman, Brigadier General Motti Almoz, wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday that the refuseniks would face &quot;the disciplinary treatment [that] would be sharp and clear&quot;. He added: &quot;There is no place for refusal in the IDF. There are arguments and there are political stances. Celebration of democracy. ... What happened here, in my eyes? Exploitation of military service to express a political stance.&quot; The most furious condemnation came from Ya&apos;alon, who described the letter as a &quot;foolish and obscene attempt to support the international false delegitimisation campaign against the State of Israel and the soldiers of the IDF&quot;. By Monday Ya&apos;alon, speaking at the same cyber-security conference as Netanyahu, was also hinting that the reserve soldiers could face criminal prosecution. &quot;Their refusal is politically, not morally, motivated. Soldiers should go to their commanders when they have a problem. Our officers and soldiers are doing sacred work which saves many lives and they deserve our gratitude. I will not allow a political abuse of this and those who signed this [refusal document] will be treated as criminals,&quot; he said.

Many students have to walk several miles to school. A road to the village was built only 15 years ago and there are no cars or buses. Most people are indigenous Quechua peasant farmers. Half of the students go on to secondary school, of whom half again go to university in Santa Cruz. A few years ago, an ecological toilet was installed; the children are now teaching their parents and grandparents about the advantages of using such toilets. The school building was small and dishevelled compared with the smart ecological toilets (built by Unicef). There was a big football field and the grass is kept short by goats. I had just missed the afternoon break, but the headteacher said it would be fine to give the kids another 10 minutes outside. The entire school came out; the boys played football while the girls played tug of war.     Likoni school for the blind. Likoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011. Photograph: James Mollison Photograph: James Mollison    Likoni school for the blindLikoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011 This school has 166 students. Many of them were born with albinism, a condition that often leads to visual impairments. Some sighted students who also have albinism are sent to the school to protect them from kidnapping by agents of witch doctors in Tanzania, where it is believed that body parts of people with the condition can bring wealth.  The students go home to their villages for a visit every three months. The school tries to allow students to move at their own pace and not force them to leave when they get to a certain age. Blind people receive no support once they leave school. A friendly head teacher welcomed us in. Hearing about the trade in body parts, I felt shocked and sad as we sat with the intrigued pupils, who wanted to touch our faces and camera. It was a particularly bright, hot day and the kids had only hats for protection. The boys played boisterous games, spinning the merry-go-round as fast as they could, trying to fling people off it, and feeling their way around the climbing frames.     Nativity School.

Photograph: James Mollison    Nativity SchoolSouth Central Los Angeles, US, photographed 10 November 2011 Founded by the Sisters of Loretto in 1924, this Catholic school has 330 students and is in a low-income area with a high crime rate. There have been several drive-by shootings nearby and once a stray bullet went through a wall. The school is private and charges $210 a month, but 65% of the students are unable to pay the full amount. It is a struggle to get enough money to pay the teachers.  When I was 16, living in tranquil north Oxford in the UK, NWA released Straight Outta Compton. LA sounded like a pretty scary place. I wondered what Ice Cube\u2019s school would have been like. So we set out to find schools in South Central Los Angeles; Nativity was the only one that said yes. The area has seen an influx of Latinos, who seemed to be the majority at the school. In the break, a group played dodgeball, a game I loved at school. Next to me some kids sold nachos to other students, raising money for the school.      Bhakta Vidyashram school.

Photograph: James Mollison    Bhakta Vidyashram schoolKathmandu, Nepal, photographed 5 December 2011 The school\u2019s two classrooms are on the ground floor of the building on the right. There are about 100 pupils, many from outside Kathmandu. The classroom amenities are basic and the children often can\u2019t afford books and pencils. Education in Nepal was traditionally based on home schooling for the elites. In 1950, only 5% of the population was literate; now it is over 60%, but barriers to education for lower castes remain. Most of the schools we found in Kathmandu had no playgrounds. We stumbled on this school by chance. The kids were unsupervised at break time. Their playground was actually a public square with a temple; an elderly man whose job seemed to be to look after it seemed oblivious to the noise as the kids screamed around him. They had no toys, but a lot of fun pulling each other around on cardboard.      Aida boys\u2019 school. Aida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013. Photograph: James Mollison    Aida boys\u2019 schoolAida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013  This camp was set up in 1950 for Palestinians who had been displaced from their villages, and the school was built shortly after. There are 395 students. During the first intifada, the school was close to the confrontation line between the Israelis and Palestinians, and the classroom walls were thickened to protect against bullets. In 2004, the Israelis built a wall right outside the entrance. As I entered Bethlehem, the road ran next to the wall, which was often covered in graffiti and art, including a Banksy dove.  The third and fourth graders watch the towers to see if the soldiers are looking and, if not, they throw stones at them. When hostilities flare up, the smell of teargas can be so strong that the headteacher has to send the students home. The boys in the playground were pretty rowdy; the headteacher later told me that the school used to be next to a convent, but the nuns complained that the boys made so much noise at break, they couldn\u2019t concentrate on their prayers. I asked him what he thought the boys made of the wall. He described it as \u201ca humiliation in front of them every day, a restriction on their future\u201d. Outside his office was a pin board of photos of the school riddled with bullet holes, from the first intifada.

The school was founded in 1908 by four nuns from Australia; students have daily prayer and philosophy studies. Discipline is important and student responsibilities include organising committees, voluntary services and working in the library. Twice a week all students have to clean the classrooms and the toilets. You enter the school through a wooded area. It has two main playgrounds, an athletics track and tennis courts. When we first went to the school, it was closed for the holidays, but we had a formal meeting with the deputy head in his office. After several minutes I began to feel itchy. I looked at the deputy head and could make out fleas walking on his shirt and fleas climbing on our translator\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to say anything as the Japanese are so polite. As soon as we said goodbye, I rushed to the bathroom and took off my trousers to try to get rid of them.  We returned the next week and found the school spotlessly clean.      St Augustine school Montserrat, photographed 18 May 2012. Photograph: James Mollison    St Augustine schoolMontserrat, photographed 18 May 2012 Since its foundation in 1875, St Augustine school has faced several natural disasters. The building was twice destroyed by hurricanes. After hurricane Hugo, a major fundraising effort resulted in a modern multistorey building , consecrated in 1991. The 1995 volcanic eruption forced the school to evacuate and eventually engulfed that new building. The school moved to a private house in a safe zone, to which new buildings and playgrounds have been added. There are 135 pupils, from families ranging from affluent to poor.  Most of the boys spent the break playing cricket, while the girls chatted enthusiastically. The picture is centred around a moment when a girl who was running tripped over, making her classmates laugh. There were only two white kids, and the boy spent the break wandering around on his own.      Holtz high school Tel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013. Photograph: James Mollison    Holtz high schoolTel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013 The high school and technical college is affiliated to the Israeli air force; it has 850 pupils. Conscription exists for all Israeli citizens over 18 (Arab-Israelis are exempted) and nearly all the pupils will be drafted into the air force, as computer or electronics engineers and mechanics. They come from all over the country, either because they want a military career, or because their parents want their kids to have discipline. We arrived on a parade day, welcomed by the jovial headteacher. I watched students practise military drills. The photograph was taken just afterwards. As well as chess and ping-pong tables, the playground had a few old military aircraft; I wasn\u2019t sure if they were a kind of museum or for lessons. The school couldn\u2019t have been more different from the arts school I visited in Jerusalem the day before, where girls had dyed hair and there was even the occasional goth.      The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010. Photograph: James Mollison    The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010  The school is split between Richmond Park and Covent Garden; its mission is to train outstanding classical ballet dancers. Every year there are 3,000 applications for just 25 places, and students come from mixed backgrounds: 89% currently rely on state scholarships. The students often have to run to their next class to allow time to change into the right kit. Boys and girls keep to their separate groups. Getting access to the school took months of negotiation. When we finally did, arriving there was quite magical, entering Richmond Park with all its deer, and then the beautiful grounds of the White Lodge, originally a hunting lodge for George II. The school doesn\u2019t have break times, but they do have a bit of time after lunch. The school had suggested bringing a choreographer for the photo, but I wanted it to be as natural as possible. \u2022 James Mollison\u2019s photographs will be published next year by Aperture in a new book, Playground.

Ahmed Bouchiki had been mistaken by agents of the Israeli secret service, Mossad, for Ali Hassan Salameh, whom they believed to have been a key figure in Black September, the extremist Palestinian faction blamed for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics the previous year. Five of the Mossad agents were convicted and jailed in Norway shortly after the killing took place. But their leader, Mike Harari, who has died aged 87, got away. Back in Jerusalem, Harari offered his resignation to the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, but it was turned down because, she told him, he &quot;still had much work to do&quot;. Nonetheless, Harari&apos;s dreadful error tarnished the career of a man referred to by some as &quot;the Zionist James Bond&quot; and probably prevented him reaching the top of an organisation that many Israelis regard as one of the pillars of the Jewish state. Harari&apos;s life was one led largely in the shadows and, according to the current defence minister, Moshe Ya&apos;alon, most of his deeds are &quot;unknown and never will be known&quot;. However, he wrote about some of his actions in his biography The Master of Operations, in which he tried to clear himself of blame for the Lillehammer fiasco, and the accounts of former colleagues leave no doubt about his huge contribution to what Israel considered its anti-terror struggle. It was Harari, for instance, who built and led the teams for Operation Wrath of God, a mission to track down and kill those Israel held responsible for the Munich terror attack. The campaign culminated in the Lillehammer failure, but three months before that Harari&apos;s agents had staged a raid on Beirut in which three senior leaders of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation were killed. It would be six years before Harari led another operation in the Lebanese capital, when this time Salameh was correctly identified and killed. In between, in July 1976, Harari had played a pivotal role in Operation Thunderbolt, in which Israeli commandos landed at Uganda&apos;s Entebbe airport to free Israeli and Jewish hostages held by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. By some accounts, Harari had successfully reconnoitred the airport beforehand by blagging his way into the control tower disguised as an Italian businessman. Harari was born in Tel Aviv when Palestine was still a British-mandated territory. He grew up amid the turmoil of the 1930s, when a huge increase in Jewish immigration to the territory, prompted by the rise of nazism in Europe, fuelled deep tensions with the local Arab population. At the age of 16 in 1943 he lied about his age to join Palmach, an elite underground commando force formed by the Jewish militia, Haganah, to prepare for a possible British withdrawal and Axis invasion of Palestine. This was his introduction to military training, including covert techniques such as sabotage. Harari was arrested several times as the British authorities attempted to disarm Palmach. At the end of the war he was sent to Marseille to try to organise the illegal emigration to Palestine of thousands of Holocaust survivors. From their stories he learned the full extent of the Nazi genocide. Following the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, Harari joined the internal security agency, Shin Bet. He established the security regime at Lod \u2013 now Ben Gurion International \u2013 airport, and in the early 50s was given responsibility for organising security at Israel&apos;s embassies around the world. Then, in 1954, he was recruited by Mossad and joined the agency&apos;s intelligence-gathering wing. He set up and ran agents across Europe and soon became the unit&apos;s commander, also playing a role in smuggling Jews out of communist eastern Europe. By the end of the 60s the emergence of Palestinian factions intent on using terrorist tactics to force their cause on to the international agenda posed a grave challenge to Israel. Harari was to be at the heart of Mossad&apos;s struggle against these organisations, and in 1970 he was appointed head of its special operations division, Caesarea. There he created a unit that was involved in sabotage and assassinations. It was this force that was given the task of finding and eliminating the Palestinians Mossad believed had planned the attack in Munich. Officially, Harari retired from Mossad in 1980 after 26 years of service. He went into private business and spent a lot of time in Central America. But he is said to have been reassigned to Mexico City for a short period as Mossad station chief, and his dealings in Panama in the 80s, at a time when the military dictator Manuel Noriega had American backing before he was ousted in 1989, are shrouded in murkiness. By some accounts he played a major role in reorganising the Panamanian military and in ensuring that Panama was able to buy Israeli weapons. But he later appeared on Israeli television to deny he had ever been an adviser to Noriega. Retired or not, Harari continued to be of service to Mossad and in 2007 he was honoured, at the age of 80, with the agency&apos;s highest decoration for an unspecified &quot;important contribution to a unique operational activity,&quot; possibly related to Israeli attempts to sabotage Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. Norway issued an arrest warrant for Harari in 1998 in connection with the Lillehammer killing, but it was cancelled a year later. He was portrayed by the actor Moshe Ivgy in Steven Spielberg&apos;s 2005 film Munich, a controversial account of Operation Wrath of God. Harari is survived by his wife, Pnina, two children and five grandchildren. \u2022 Michael Harari, intelligence officer, born 18 February 1927; died 21 September 2014", "publicationDate": "2014-09-23T17:00:46Z", "title": "Mike Harari obituary", "sentences": ["Harari was born in Tel Aviv when Palestine was still a British-mandated territory."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/mike-harari"}, {"tags": ["Watford", "Football", "Championship", "Sport"], "article": "\u00d3scar Garc\u00eda has left his position as the Watford manager with immediate effect and has been replaced by Billy McKinlay. Garc\u00eda\u2019s future had become the subject of scrutiny after he was taken to hospital with chest pains on 14 September. It was reported two days later the 41-year-old was still in hospital and in need of more rest. Watford have now confirmed in a statement on their website that, although Garc\u00eda\u2019s health was no longer a cause for concern, he needed more time to rest and felt it was best for the club for if he resigned. The former Scotland international McKinlay was hired by the club as a first-team coach last week and the club have confirmed his appointment as the head coach. \u201cI was closely involved with the appointment of Billy McKinlay, because I was aware I may not be able to return,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI always wanted an experienced British coach within our set-up, because it\u2019s important to have that mix of cultures and experience with this squad. \u201cI would like to thank Watford\u2019s fans for their kindness during my time here at the club. I will be hoping to see you all as a Premier League club next season.\u201d The Watford chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said: \u201cEveryone feels it is important that there is continuity in the coaching structure. Ruben Mart\u00ednez and Javier Pereira will therefore continue as Billy McKinlay\u2019s assistants. \u201cWe appreciate Oscar\u2019s candour in placing the best interest of Watford ahead of his own personal thoughts and we wish him well for his future in football. \u201cIn Billy McKinlay, we have someone with the qualities and significant experience to build further on the foundations already laid for a successful season ahead.\u201d Garc\u00eda, the former Brighton and Maccabi Tel Aviv manager, was appointed by Watford at the beginning of September to replace Beppe Sannino. Watford are fourth in the Championship with 17 points from nine games, although Garc\u00eda was able to take charge for only one, a 1-0 defeat to Charlton on 13 September.

In these days of frenzied movement between clubs, careers have a whiff of the choose-your-own-adventure \u2013 with the pot of gold and the pit of dragons lying just a judicious turn of the page from one another. It is never that simple. But when he looks along the touchline at Basel\u2019s St Jakob Park on Wednesday night, the home side\u2019s manager Paulo Sousa will be reminded that, sometimes, the wrong choice might not prove calamitous. That is despite the fact that he will see his Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers, the man who picked up the pieces at Swansea City in July 2010 when the Portuguese, having led an improving side to seventh in the Championship, decided that Leicester City and his friend Milan Mandaric were a better bet to shoot for the stars. Sousa lasted 86 days at the King Power Stadium before being sacked. He had now gone through three second-tier clubs in under two years, and black marks of that severity have proved indelible for some managers. In May 2011, Rodgers and Swansea were celebrating promotion at Wembley; the subsequent momentum would be inexorable for both. Sousa had moved on by then: three weeks previously he had settled for the relative obscurity of the Hungarian league, with Videoton. \u201cWith hindsight, yes, of course I made a mistake in leaving Swansea,\u201d Sousa tells the Guardian. \u201cBut the time I felt that moving to Leicester offered me the best opportunity for my career. We all make mistakes in life, but it is what you do next that counts.\u201d Moving to Hungary was bold but clever. Videoton had just been crowned champions and offered a platform for instant success; they would finish second under Sousa but he won two domestic cup competitions and, in 2012-13, took them to the Europa League group stage. There, he claimed the scalps of Sporting Lisbon and \u2013 notably \u2013 Basel. A subsequent season with Maccabi Tel Aviv was no less obscure but equally fruitful: an Israeli league title and the narrowest of 4-3 aggregate defeats to Basel, again, in the Champions League qualifiers were further suggestion that Sousa, a Champions League winner with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund in the 1990s and one of that decade\u2019s cleverest deep midfielders, could meet high expectations in the dugout. \u201cAfter things didn\u2019t work out at Leicester I had a break from the game, watched matches and studied styles of play, tactics and continued my coaching education,\u201d explains Sousa. \u201cI think the break helped me. \u201cMy 18 months with Videoton helped me discover my winning mentality. Then we went one step further with Maccabi. Those two and a half years were crucial for me. I had no problem with going to less well-known leagues. I think it is important for a coach to have success because it justifies his methods and approach, and success creates a positive atmosphere.\u201d For Basel, Sousa\u2019s performances as opposition manager in successive seasons were evidence enough that his modus operandi was a suitable substitute for Murat Yakin, who now coaches Spartak Moscow. \u201cI think that the club saw what I could do as a manager, with a team with a modest budget. We [Maccabi] played well against Basel over the two legs and made them work hard for their victory,\u201d he says. \u201cSo yes, the next step was appealing to me. Basel is a great club and they match my ambitions. I have been welcomed by everyone and I want to repay the club\u2019s faith with success \u2013 that is my motivation and my challenge.\u201d It is, for all the Swiss league\u2019s modesty, a step up. Basel are watched by crowds whose fervour makes a mockery of cliches about the nation\u2019s reserve. They have played group stage football in four of the last six seasons, and beat Chelsea at St Jakob Park last year. Competing to the end in a group that also includes Real Madrid and Ludogorets would perhaps be vindication to those who, after Sousa\u2019s failure at Leicester, wondered whether his playing reputation might just have preceded him. \u201cWe need to be successful domestically, but we also want to compete in European football so that we can have the likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool here on a regular basis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, the target is to beat them and to reach the knockout stages. If we can do that this season then great, but it is early days.\u201d A 5-1 defeat at the Bernab\u00e9u two weeks ago does not augur well, although Sousa points out that his team had 16 shots at goal. He also stresses that his side is more of a work in progress than Yakin\u2019s of a year ago, which could call upon key players such as the now-departed Valentin Stocker and Yann Sommer. But he knows that a positive result could reintroduce him into the thoughts of a country where his business appears far from finished \u2013 \u201cright club, wrong time,\u201d he says of his ill-fated first club position at Queens Park Rangers. He points out that a figure equally well known in England and Switzerland has proved the merit of trying again when at first you do not succeed. \u201cLook at Roy Hodgson,\u201d he says. \u201cI played under him for Internazionale; he has managed international teams, managed clubs sides across Europe and then came back to English football and eventually managed his country. If managers have difficulties, or perceived failures in their careers, it is important to take time to plan your next decision, rebuild, try somewhere else and continue to progress.\u201d Sousa recognises a kindred spirit in Rodgers (\u201cAll of the managers who have worked under Huw Jenkins at Swansea in recent years have had a similar approach\u201d) and does not attempt to claim credit for laying any of the foundations he worked from in south Wales. There is satisfaction enough that they can now stand together and that, even if he took the long way around, Sousa has selected his most recent adventures well.", "publicationDate": "2014-09-30T09:44:41Z", "title": "Basel\u2019s Paulo Sousa: \u2018Yes, I made a mistake in leaving Swansea\u2019", "sentences": ["A subsequent season with Maccabi Tel Aviv was no less obscure but equally fruitful: an Israeli league title and the narrowest of 4-3 aggregate defeats to Basel, again, in the Champions League qualifiers were further suggestion that Sousa, a Champions League winner with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund in the 1990s and one of that decade\u2019s cleverest deep midfielders, could meet high expectations in the dugout."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/30/basel-paulo-sousa-swansea-liverpool-brendan-rodgers"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Judaism", "World news", "Airline industry", "Business", "Women", "Gender"], "article": "Israel\u2019s national airline, El Al, has been criticised for allowing ultra-orthodox Jewish men to disrupt flights by refusing to be seated next to women. A petition on change.org is demanding that the carrier \u201cstop the bullying, intimidation and discrimination against women on your flights\u201d. One flight last week, from New York\u2019s JFK airport to Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport, descended into chaos according to passengers, after a large group of haredim, or ultra-orthodox Jews, refused to take their seats next to women, in accordance with strict religious customs. The episode has prompted other women to come forward with similar stories on international flights to and from Tel Aviv. Amit Ben-Natan, a passenger on last week\u2019s El Al flight from New York, said take-off was delayed after numerous and repeated requests by ultra-orthodox men for female passengers to be moved. \u201cPeople stood in the aisles and refused to go forward,\u201d she told the Ynet website. \u201cAlthough everyone had tickets with seat numbers that they purchased in advance, they asked us to trade seats with them, and even offered to pay money, since they cannot sit next to a woman. It was obvious that the plane won\u2019t take off as long as they keep standing in the aisles.\u201d Another passenger on the flight, named only as Galit, said ultra-orthodox passengers had suggested she and her husband sit separately to accommodate their religious requirements. She refused, but added: \u201cI ended up sitting next to a haredi man who jumped out of his seat the moment we had finished taking off and proceeded to stand in the aisle.\u201d On a different flight, Elana Sztokman, a former executive director of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, refused to accede to a request to move seats, triggering \u201cfrantic negotiations\u201d, she said, between ultra-orthodox men and airline staff. \u201cWhat happened to me on this flight isn\u2019t that different from what happens on almost every flight,\u201d she told Voice of Israel radio. \u201cYou get on a plane, and the plane is about to take off but a whole bunch of ultra-orthodox men start playing around, moving around, whispering, moving back and forth trying to find different seats \u2026 Anyone who\u2019s ever travelled on El Al has experienced this.\u201d Sharon Shapiro, from Chicago, the organiser of the online petition \u2013 which had attracted about 1,000 backers by Tuesday morning \u2013 said it was \u201cnot right that female passengers are being intimidated or harassed. It\u2019s one thing to ask nicely, but if someone says no, they should not be put under pressure.\u201d There was a genuine dilemma for some ultra-orthodox Jews. \u201cWhat most people don\u2019t understand is that it\u2019s not personal\u201d, but considered by some to be a religious obligation. Airlines should seek a way of accommodating the religious requirements of passengers without breaching others\u2019 civil rights, she said. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why El Al asks passengers to sort these things out among themselves. It would be better if people can get on a plane knowing they\u2019re sitting somewhere they feel comfortable. Otherwise, it adds to tensions and misunderstandings between religious and secular [passengers].\u201d The petition says: \u201cIf a passenger was being verbally or physically abusive to airline staff, they would immediately be removed from the plane \u2026 If a passenger was openly engaging in racial or religious discrimination against another passenger or flight attendant, they would immediately be removed from the plane. Why then, does El Al Airlines allow gender discrimination against women? \u201cWhy does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? \u201cOne person\u2019s religious rights does not trump another person\u2019s civil rights.\u201d It suggests that El Al reserves a few rows of segregated seating available in advance for a fee. Among comments posted on change.org, Judith Margolis from Jerusalem said: \u201cThe behaviour involving harassing women in the name of religious observance is outrageous. That airlines allow some passengers to disrupt flights is unacceptable.\u201d Myla Kaplan of Haifa said: \u201cI no longer feel comfortable flying on El Al due to the bullying and delays and general humiliation of being asked to move out of a seat I reserved in advance.\u201d In a statement, El Al said it made \u201cevery effort possible to ensure a passenger\u2019s flight is as enjoyable as possible while doing our utmost to maintain schedules and arrive safely at the destination. \u201cEl Al is committed to responding to every complaint received and if it is found that there are possibilities for improvement in the future, those suggestions will be taken into consideration.\u201d Female passengers on other airlines flying to and from Israel, such as British Airways and easyJet, have also been asked to move seats at the request of ultra-orthodox men. Some airlines close toilets for periods during flights to allow men to gather to pray. The outcry over flights comes against a backdrop of moves by hardline ultra-orthodox communities in Israel to impose dress codes on women, restrictions on where they can sit on public buses, segregated checkout queues in supermarkets and the removal of women\u2019s images from advertising hoardings. Sztokman \u2013 whose flight came at the end of a US speaking tour on her new book, The War on Women in Israel: A Story of Religious Radicalisation and Women Fighting for Freedom \u2013 said such demands had increased over the past decade. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing today \u2026 is about the erasure of women\u2019s faces from the public sphere, the erasure of women\u2019s names from newspaper articles, the refusal to let women talk on radio stations \u201cIt\u2019s a whole array of practices of women\u2019s exclusion and women\u2019s degradation that has got much worse.\u201d  \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2014 to clarify Elana Sztokman\u2019s job title.

The event, commemorated annually around the world as Holocaust Memorial Day, will be given a high profile on BBC1 and BBC2 and will include a discussion, documentaries and the screening of Shoah, Claude Lanzmann&apos;s acclaimed 10-hour documentary from 1985. Cohen&apos;s decision to give the event such prominence comes amid growing concern about a rise in antisemitism across Europe. In The Eichmann Show, Freeman, star of Sherlock and The Hobbit, will play TV producer Milton Fruchtman, who worked on the televising of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the Nazi &quot;final solution&quot;, the plan to exterminate Europe&apos;s Jews. Eichmann&apos;s capture in Buenos Aires and transport to Israel made global headlines in 1960, but it was a year before he was brought to trial before the Jerusalem district court in the auditorium of a newly built cultural centre. The broadcast of these legal proceedings, known at the time as the &quot;trial of the century&quot;, went out to 37 countries and ran for four months. It exposed the wider world to the horrors of the death camps and allowed testimony from survivors to be heard live. Often described as the first global TV event, the trial was watched by 80% of the German population for at least an hour a week, and there were repeated reports of viewers fainting. Screened on BBC2, The Eichmann Show will also star Golden Globe-winner Anthony LaPaglia, the Australian actor familiar from the US television series Without a Trace, who will play the TV director Leo Hurwitz. The Eichmann Show will be accompanied by five short films on BBC2&apos;s Learning Zone, aimed at providing a different perspective on the trial that will link to the school curriculum. It will also repeat Children of the Holocaust, an animation based on eyewitness accounts put together for a young audience. The programmes will centre on coverage of the memorial eve, nt itself, which is organised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. British survivors of the Holocaust will gather in central London for an event to be themed around the phrase &quot;keep the memory alive&quot;. They will be joined by leading political and religious figures for a ceremony taking place in tandem with one held at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland. &quot;We are delighted that the BBC will be ensuring Holocaust Memorial Day is marked by the widest possible audience,&quot; said Olivia Marks-Woldman, chief executive of the Memorial Day Trust. &quot;On 27 January we honour the survivors of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides and challenge ourselves to learn important lessons from their experiences in order to create a safer, better future.&quot; On the same day BBC1 will broadcast A Story of Remembrance, in which three women will recount the effect of the Holocaust on their lives and families. Auschwitz survivor Kitty Hart-Moxon will describe her postwar struggle to talk about her suffering; acclaimed children&apos;s author Judith Kerr, who wrote The Tiger That Came to Tea and Mog the Forgetful Cat, will recall her childhood escape from Nazi Germany; and Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner is to travel to the former home of her Jewish ancestors to learn about their fate. BBC1 will also broadcast Big Questions, a special one-hour debate examining issues raised by the anniversary. BBC2 is to screen Touched by Auschwitz, a 90-minute documentary by acclaimed film-maker Laurence Rees. Shot in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Chicago, London, Bavaria and Krakow, it is billed as &quot;a compelling portrait of the problems, challenges and triumphs that six individuals have experienced since the war as a result of their time in the camp&quot;. Also scheduled for BBC2 is Freddie Knoller&apos;s War, a film telling the story of a Jewish survivor who is now 93. As a teenager, he fled his comfortable family home in Vienna after Kristallnacht in 1938. He escaped to Belgium, then to Paris, then on to the south of France where he joined the French resistance before being betrayed by a girlfriend and transported to Auschwitz. His parents, who had told their son they were too old to flee, were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944.

But that might be a needlessly combative attitude, according to a partner at one of Europe\u2019s leading venture capital firms. Saul Klein, a partner of Swiss venture capital firm Index Ventures, says that the best-placed tech firms are increasingly international from day one. They\u2019ll launch an office in a second country before they\u2019ve even left the co-working space they were founded in. \u201cThe best entrepreneurs tap in to any and all\u201d of the various ecosystems, from London to Tel Aviv and San Francisco to New York, Klein says. \u201cIf you\u2019re starting a company in Copenhagen, like ZenDesk, those guys got on a plane and moved to San Fransicso. And now they\u2019re a $1bn company. You have other companies like Criteo, probably one of the most successful tech IPOs in the last ten years: they grew up in Paris, moved to the UK, moved to the Valley, moved to Japan, and now they\u2019re a multi-national doing business across the board. \u201cI think the best companies take a journey that taps into this global ecosystem.\u201d Klein\u2019s comments contrast with those of policymakers, who are focused on building the capital up as the best place to start a business. In 2013, Boris Johnson launched the Million Pound Startup competition, aimed at enticing promising businesses to London. Described as \u201ca new, groundbreaking global competition to bring a high-growth technology company to London\u201d, it offered \u00a31m to the winner, as long as they moved their HQ to the capital. But by this year, the competition had been abandoned, with one judge admitting that \u201cIn the end it proved difficult to find companies that had both the right level of ambition and could stand a valuation for \u00a32m-\u00a310m.\u201d For Klein, London is already a big enough player to stand as a necessary part of any company \u2013 but it\u2019s silly to try and compete with Silicon Valley on its own terms. \u201cTalking about the Bay Area, there\u2019s more capital, there are more corporate clients, there are more forward-thinking academic institutions, there\u2019s just more of everything, in orders of magnitude. It\u2019s been going for 60 years and I can\u2019t believe that that\u2019s necessarily going to change in my lifetime, or even my children\u2019s lifetimes.\u201d But just because everything in San Francisco is bigger and better, Klein cautions against start ups \u201cjumping on a plane\u201d in the hope that \u201cmoney falls from trees\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s more money, but more people going after it.

Ex-husband. Ex-boyfriend. Estranged boyfriend.\u2019 It was always that she had tried to leave. She had done exactly what we think they\u2019re supposed to do and she dies. And her children die.\u201d Gruelle, the center of Hill\u2019s documentary, is a survivor of domestic violence herself, and is now an advocate for battered and broken women. It\u2019s a job that requires constant vigilance. About one in four women will at one point in their lives be beaten or abused by someone they know. Each year about 4,000 women die because of domestic violence. Hill focused her documentary on Gruelle, giving the audience an insider\u2019s look on what happens to victims of domestic violence, why they stay and why they leave. The Guardian sat down with Gruelle to talk about her journey, abusers and their tactics and the habit of blaming the victims, instead of their abusers. Below is an edited transcript of our conversation.      Deanna Walters, another domestic violence survivor featured in Private Violence, and Kit Gruelle at the New York screening. Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images    In the documentary, you mention that you have been previously abused by your husband. How did you transition to becoming an advocate who helps domestic violence victims?  A lot of the women who do this, certainly not all but a lot, have had a personal experience with it. For myself, I just felt very lucky that I survived and then took my sons out of the North Carolina mountains and down to the Chapel Hill area. A few years later, I saw an ad to become an advocate, went to the training, and it was just like finding a glove that fit perfectly. It was my calling. Understanding intimate abusive relationships was critically important.  But for me politically, it was also about understanding that the systems that battered women have to turn to oftentimes are just as oppressive as the abuser himself. I like taking on oppressive systems and trying to level the playing field a little bit. So it just worked.  I remembered the things that happened and that did not happen when I was going through it. I just wanted to make sure that everyone out there who is potentially a first responder to domestic violence victims \u2013 which is essentially everyone, but key people like law enforcement officers and healthcare providers and clergy \u2013 had some degree of understanding of how to listen to a battered woman. She\u2019s the expert on what\u2019s happening in her relationship. There\u2019s a scene in the movie where you\u2019re training some first responders how to handle a domestic violence case. You emphasise that an abuser can exercise control over a victim with just one look. Why is this kind of training necessary?  Law enforcement officers have to fine tune their antennae for the behaviours that might not exactly constitute an arrestable offence, but that should indicate to that officer how much danger she is in.        Photograph: HBO Documentary Films/Private Violence    Because the reality of it is, for abusers, it\u2019s almost like they have a toolbox and in that toolbox they have a variety of tactics \u2013 everything from a dozen red roses and \u201cOh, baby\u201d and a night out on the town to threats to a gun. He will use any one of the tactics that he feels he needs to use to make sure that his position of power and dominance is maintained in the relationship. An abuser has his toolbox. Is there a toolbox for domestic violence survivors? Are there certain skills that they have to learn?  They need to understand early on what to look for. Every single woman I have ever worked with, for the last now, close to 30 years, has always said to me: \u201cHe was the nicest guy I ever met when we first got together.\u201d  We need to teach girls and young women to look for the warning signs and to know what they are early on and to be clear that jealousy and love aren\u2019t the same thing. That when he starts to do things to make her feel controlled, telling her that she can\u2019t hang out with her friends any more, [those are the warning signs].  Maybe he wants to be with her all the time and doesn\u2019t want her to see her family or whatever. If she fine-tunes her own antenna, and then learns early on that she can\u2019t fix him, that if he is someone invested in controlling her or other women that there\u2019s nothing she can do to change that. Then maybe women won\u2019t find themselves partnered with these guys, who see them as property and not as women.  I have been thinking about this lately. Abusers have enormous egos, an enormous need to be the centre of attention. They have a sense of entitlement. They expect everything is going to go their way all the time, and when it doesn\u2019t, they reach for their toolbox. I got this visual the other day that the man in an abusive relationship is the centre of that particular universe and women become satellites \u2013 just sort of rotating around him. It\u2019s not a good relationship. Relationships, the ones that I have seen that are good, long-term, healthy relationships, they\u2019re based on a fundamental sense of respect and equality. Period.  One of the tools in the abuser\u2019s toolbox can be money and access to it. Women often don\u2019t have the financial resources to leave. This is one of the reasons why domestic violence programmws are so vital and the work that the advocates do is so important, because the advocates listen to her, find out what the needs are and then do whatever they can to help her access the resources that she needs to get out if she thinks that getting out is what she should do. Many battered women stay, because they think: \u201cIf I leave, I\u2019m going to die.\u201d       Photograph: HBO Documentary Films/Private Violence    The other side of the resources issue is we tend to focus on - or frame battered women as being women with little to no access to finance. But there\u2019s the other side of the coin and that\u2019s women who are married to wealthy, powerful men. Abuse happens at every socioeconomic level, and yet in the documentary a psychology professors writes on your report that that is not the case. I can\u2019t tell you how angry I was when I read that across the bottom of that page. Because over the years I\u2019ve worked with women who are married to PhDs, who are heads of research and development at big companies, who are doctors, lawyers, professors, you name it. And sometimes the wives are doctors, lawyers and professors. But what people don\u2019t understand is that what the offender wants to do more than anything else is get inside her head. Once he is inside her head, then he is the one that\u2019s running the show, which again goes back to the tactics. If she becomes afraid that if she doesn\u2019t do things according to his dictates then there\u2019ll be consequences, if she has been conditioned, then he has effectively inhabited her brain and now she is not thinking for herself. And I\u2019ve seen that happen with women who are educated, smart, competent women, which is why this kind of violence is so insidious. It doesn\u2019t come in like a tsunami. It comes in like constant [seemingly] gentle waves.  Throughout the documentary we see you clipping out newspaper articles on domestic violence. Why? One of the things that I find the most annoying is our determination to blame women for male violence.  We don\u2019t do it with any other crime. Say a bank has been robbed in your community. Maybe the bank has been robbed four or five times already. And the 911 call goes out. Law enforcement comes out. They interview the witnesses. They dust for prints. They do an investigation. When they are done with the investigation, they don\u2019t go to the bank president and say:  \u201cWhy did you keep all that money here? We\u2019ve already been out here four or five times. Do you like getting robbed? I can\u2019t believe you are still doing business here. Why haven\u2019t you moved your bank?\u201d We have to start asking better questions. Rather than \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t she just leave\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cwhy does he abuse her\u201d and \u201cwhy does society drive the getaway car\u201d.     Kit Gruelle cutting out an article on domestic violence.  Photograph: Rex Miller/Private Violence    There were some disappointing moments in the documentary where the justice system, and its many loopholes, don\u2019t protect the victims of domestic violence. What would you like to see change in that area? In America, we have got kind of a one-note-Charlie response \u2013 it\u2019s either nothing or jail. Slap on the wrist or jail.  There\u2019s a program in Tel Aviv, Israel, which I would love to see come to the US. What they\u2019ve decided in Tel Aviv a number of years ago is that telling women and children who had been abused that they then had to go into a shelter and leave behind their family, their friends, their schools, their jobs, their pets, everything they knew and hide out is wrong. Because on one hand, it\u2019s saying to her: \u201cOK, you have to reconfigure your life because of this violence.\u201d And it\u2019s saying to him: \u201cWe are going to expect that women are going to reconfigure their lives.\u201d Imagine if rather than calling shelters, shelters, which is kind of a warm, cosy term, we called them refugee camps?  Right, that\u2019s kind of what they are.  That\u2019s exactly what they are. They are refugee camps. And what they did in Tel Aviv is rather than have women and children flee to a shelter \u2013 and they still have shelters there \u2013 they said, \u201cNo, we are going to build a facility to send abusers to.\u201d And men go there for four months stay. It\u2019s much more appropriate response. It\u2019s a strong political statement, because what they are saying Tel Aviv is: \u201cWe are not going to sanction his violence. We are going to as society hold him accountable.\u201d      Janay Rice, left, looks on as her husband, former running back Ray Rice, speaks to media about the domestic violence charges that were levied against him. Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP    I think if we could do that in a thoughtful, comprehensive, legitimate way in this country, I think things would change dramatically.  Janay Rice, the wife of NFL player Ray Rice, suffered graphic abuse in a surveillance video that started a national conversation on spousal abuse. Do you think that now this incident will drive conversation? That something might change in the way we approach domestic violence? I think it will. Thank God, Janay Rice is OK. And by OK, I mean she is not dead, because he could\u2019ve killed her. I am very thankful that that didn\u2019t happen. It will be interesting over the months ahead to see what happens with them. For me and for those of us who do this work, we think it would be incredible if he would accept responsibility for what he did, number one. Number two, get the kind of counselling that abusive men need to get. Then, number three, if he would go public with it. If he would say: \u201cThis is what I have learned about men\u2019s violence against women. I have a daughter and I have a wife that I love, and I am committed to doing my part to stopping men\u2019s violence against women and here\u2019s how I am going to do it. I am going to do it by talking about what I\u2019ve learned.\u201d With him being an NFL player or a former NFL player, I think it could be huge. The same thing for Janay, I think if she decided that she wanted to sort of step out from underneath the waterfall that she has found herself under and start to understand the social pressures that she has had to deal with, and articulate those in a way that was meaningful to women and girls across the country, I think it could be huge.", "publicationDate": "2014-10-20T20:00:02Z", "title": "Private Violence: up to 75% of abused women who are murdered are killed after they leave their partners", "sentences": ["There\u2019s a program in Tel Aviv, Israel, which I would love to see come to the US.", "What they\u2019ve decided in Tel Aviv a number of years ago is that telling women and children who had been abused that they then had to go into a shelter and leave behind their family, their friends, their schools, their jobs, their pets, everything they knew and hide out is wrong.", "And what they did in Tel Aviv is rather than have women and children flee to a shelter \u2013 and they still have shelters there \u2013 they said, \u201cNo, we are going to build a facility to send abusers to.\u201d And men go there for four months stay.", "It\u2019s a strong political statement, because what they are saying Tel Aviv is: \u201cWe are not going to sanction his violence."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/20/domestic-private-violence-women-men-abuse-hbo-ray-rice"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "\u201cHas an injury ever delayed play by so long in a televised Saturday lunchtime game that the final whistle came after 3pm, so the broadcasters were unable to show the conclusion of the match because of the black-out laws?\u201d asks Ian Burnett. Well we immediately thought of the day when Arsenal\u2019s Eduardo da Silva broke his leg at Birmingham City in 2008 but that match finished before 3pm. William Gallas stayed on the pitch for a little longer, though. But help is at hand, Ian. \u201cI distinctly remember the Chelsea v Everton FA Cup fourth-round replay in 2011 being played on a Saturday lunchtime,\u201d says Sam Huxley. \u201cAs the game went to extra-time, and then penalties, the game finished at 3.10pm, and I\u2019m pretty sure was shown on ESPN. Therefore, the blackout rule wasn\u2019t observed in this instance.\u201d And Steve Williams adds: \u201cAlthough it is true that live football isn\u2019t permitted to be shown on British TV between 2.45 and 5.15 on a Saturday, in practice the situation described would never happen as matches in progress are allowed to be broadcast to their completion. This doesn\u2019t mean an enterprising broadcaster would be able to get around it by showing a match kicking off at 2.44pm but they can continue as long as they can reasonably have been expected to finish before the black-out. \u201cHence in February 2011, ESPN showed Everton vs Chelsea in an FA Cup fourth round replay with a Saturday 12.45 kick-off which went to extra time and penalties and wasn\u2019t finished until about quarter past three. But ESPN were still able to show the whole thing.\u201d Ah, the romance of the cup. We do have one problem, though, namely that all available evidence suggests that while the match was indeed televised on ESPN, it actually began at 12.30pm. See, look here \u2013 and if you can\u2019t trust the Guardian squad sheets, which would be understandable, then here\u2019s more proof on the FA\u2019s website. Meanwhile the Guardian\u2019s minute-by-minute report shows no sign of kick-off being delayed until 12.45pm. Nonetheless it seems that the match, which was won by Everton on penalties after finishing 1-1 and took roughly 127 minutes to complete, did end after 3pm, continued to be televised and did not cause any of the afternoon\u2019s kick-offs to be delayed. A fat lot of good it did Everton, though. Having beaten Chelsea, they then went and lost at home to Reading in the next round. Oh Moyesie! HAT-TRICK OF HEADERS (2) Last week we discussed players who have scored hat-tricks of headers and you good people have come up with a few more. \u201cOn 13 September 1994, Newcastle United\u2019s first game in Europe for 17 years saw a headed hat-trick by Robert Lee against Antwerp in a 5-0 away win,\u201d says Leonardo Manfredi. \u201cHappy days.\u201d Happy days indeed and a shameful show of ambition from Lee. Doesn\u2019t he know that\u2019s not the way things are done at Newcastle? Stig Wallerman also writes in with news from Sweden: \u201cSwede Ralf Edstrom, only 20 years old and earning his second cap, headed home three times when Sweden came back from 1-3 to 4-4 in a friendly against the Soviet Union in 1972. He went on to score four goals in the 1974 World Cup (and a total of 140 from a career of 303 top flight games), and to become league winner in Sweden, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\u201d MANAGERIAL CHANGERS VERSUS LEAGUE POSITION \u201cWhat with Watford on their fourth manager, sitting third in the Championship, have any clubs previously had more managers in a season than their finishing position in the table,\u201d Ewan Minter asks. \u201cAnd probably excluding teams with two managers and finishing first, which I imagine has happened quite a few times.\u201d Here\u2019s an answer from James Straughan: \u201cIn the 2005/06 season, Heart of Midlothian finished second in the SPL, despite numerous changes in manager. George Burley lasted until 21 October, before being replaced by John McGlynn (caretaker), followed by Graham Rix (8 November 2005 \u2013 22 March 2006) who was in turn replaced by Valdas Ivanauskas; 3 permanent managers for a team which finished second.\u201d LEAGUE GAMES AGAINST TEAMS WHOSE NAME START WITH THE SAME LETTER \u201cAmidst Watford\u2019s current policy of replacing their manager every other week, their last five league fixtures have been against Brighton, Brentford, Blackburn, Bournemouth and Blackpool, all of whose team names start with the letter B,\u201d Owen Keating last week. \u201cHas any other team ever played so many consecutive league games against teams whose names start with the same letter?\u201d Well everyone loves alphabet banter, no one more so than Eran Rabl. \u201cIt might be a bit of a cheat, but the best answer I could come up with is 14, in Israel. It\u2019s a bit of a cheat since most of the teams\u2019 names start with either Hapoel or Maccabi. \u201cBack in the late \u201860s there was a bit of a match-fixing problem in Israel, mostly by teams affiliated to the same sport organisation (Hapoel, Maccabi and Beitar) aiming to help each other to championships, promotions and avoiding relegation. In order to fight this, the IFA fixed the league schedule so that a team would play other teams from its sport organisation first, and then against teams from other organisations. \u201cThis meant that Shimshon Tel Aviv, affiliated to the Hapoel organisation, started the league against all teams whose name started with Hapoel, and since there were 7 of those in the league, this meant 14 consecutive matches against \u201cH\u201d teams. \u201cFor example, in 1965-66: Hapoel Haifa (rounds 1 &amp; 2), Hapoel Mahane Yehuda (rounds 3 &amp; 4), Hapoel Petah Tikva (rounds 5 &amp; 6), Hapoel Ramat Gan (rounds 7 &amp; 8), Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva (rounds 9 &amp; 10), Hapoel Tel Aviv (rounds 11 &amp; 12) and Hapoel Jerusalem (rounds 13 &amp; 14). This was repeated in 1966-68, 1968-69, 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cI wonder if you can help me,\u201d Aladair Maughan asked in 2002 . \u201cI remember reading about a match being played in an African cup competition (I think) where both teams were trying to score own goals in order to try to make/try to prevent the game from going into extra time and being won on a golden goal. Does anyone know the exact details of this, or if it\u2019s just an urban myth? It might sound like an urban myth, Alasdair, but it\u2019s (almost) 100% true. The crazy events you describe took place in a Shell Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada in 1994. Going into the last group game Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals to qualify for the final stages. Anything less and Grenada went through. So far, so simple. Except that the organisers had decided that, in the case of extra time, a golden goal would count as two goals. You don\u2019t have to be Einstein to work out what happened next. Barbados raced to a 2-0 lead before Grenada made it 2-1 with seven minutes remaining. The Barjans were heading out unless they scored a goal; any goal. Fortunately for them, with three minutes left, they did just that - only not in the right net. Their deliberate own goal made it 2-2 and propelled the game towards extra time. Now, farcically, Grenada needed to score a goal (at either end) to go through. Cue frantic defending of both penalty areas by Barbados until the final whistle. Such dubious shenanigans were rewarded, however, when Barbados scored the golden goal - this time in Grenada\u2019s net - four minutes into extra time to win the match 3-2 (or 4-2 according to the rules of the tournament) and qualify for the finals. Incidentally, the match is detailed in more depth here However this isn\u2019t the only example of a blatant own-goal being scored to further a team\u2019s ambitions. As James Syme points out, it also happened in the infamous 1998 Tiger Cup game between Thailand and Indonesia. \u201cWhoever won would get to face hot favourites Vietnam in the next round, so both teams tried to throw the match,\u201d he says. \u201cAt 2-2 and with a few minutes left, the Indonesians dropped all pretence and turned on their own goal, now defended by Thai players. \u201cIn injury time the Indonesian keeper-captain Mursyid Effendi \u2018saved\u2019 the ball, turned round and thumped the ball into his own goal for a 3-2 final result.\u201d Justice was eventually served, however. For not only did Indonesia and Thailand lose their semi-final games (to Singapore and Vietnam, respectively) but both were also fined $40,000 for \u201cviolating the spirit of the game.\u201d Meanwhile Mursyid Effendi was banned for life. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.

The lineup: Igor (bass), Lyubov (vocals), Sergey (drums), Rustam (synths, electronics), Roman (guitars). The background: It\u2019s been a good year for shoegaze: Slowdive reformed and got the props they deserved after years of being derided as the runts of the noisepop litter, while whole websites appeared devoted to not just the historical stuff but celebrating the great new music being made under the banner of fuzz-haze (to coin a new term) right now. More specifically, this week has been a good week for shoegaze: news came in of a great new band from Tel Aviv called Vaadat Charigim, which may or may not be Hebrew for \u201cstares wanly at effects pedal\u201d. And now here\u2019s a great new Russian band called Pinkshinyultrablast, whose very name connotes the radiant charm and shimmering power of the best shoegaze music. They have been compared to Lush, who were one of those post-MBV shoegaze bands who partly succeeded in taking noisepop into the charts, just prior to Britpop.  Singer Lyubov, when she\u2019s not chirruping in tongues \u00e0 la Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins (although apparently, if you can discern the words through the miasma of reverb and guitar dazzle, she sings in English, not Russian, because our language is \u201cmore melodious\u201d \u2013 tell that to Sleaford Mods), is a student of the Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson school of diaphanous coo. But they don\u2019t want to just be seen as genre copycats or karaoke \u2019gazers; they\u2019re keen to push the electronic side of what they do, citing techno bods (Sabres of Paradise), modern classical/minimalist composers (Terry Riley, Philip Glass) and krautrockers (Cluster, Popul Vuh) as influences.     Listen to Pinkshinyultrablast.   Mostly, though, they\u2019re a quiet riot of ethereal vocals and lustrous guitars. We\u2019ve heard their January 2015 debut album Everything Else Matters and you will like it if you love Slowdive or indeed Lush but can\u2019t wait for their reunion. Wish We Were builds and builds until really it could only be accommodated live in a sonic cathedral. The band\u2019s name and the title of the track Holy Forest conflate two very shoegaze things: a sense of light leading to revelation and quasi-religious epiphany. Glitter expresses most fully the band\u2019s debt to the Cocteaus, adding a smattering of grungey riffage to prove these are earthbound musicians not will o\u2019 the wisps. Land\u2019s End climaxes with a showerburst of guitar scintillae that will have you: a) checking the credits to see whether Robin Guthrie was at the controls; and b) wondering whether My Bloody Valentine might consider incorporating it into the \u201cholocaust\u201d section of You Made Me Realise the next time they play it in concert.  They may not get the column inches of Pussy Riot, but Pinkshinyultrablast offer just as valid an insight into young modern Russia, even if it does come via the early-90s Thames Valley. The buzz: \u201cThey\u2019re the most interesting shoegaze band in the world right now\u201d \u2013 the Dumbing of America. The truth: This is Lush-ous stuff.  Most likely to: Bring a blush to the snow.  Least likely to: Hiccup sugar.  What to buy: The single Umi is released by Club AC30 on 10 November. Debut album Everything Else Matters comes out in January.  File next to: Lush, Slowdive, Cocteau Twins, Astrobrite.

The boom in collaborative social travel continues apace, with locals catering directly for travellers wanting a more real (or cheaper) deal. Leading the charge is airbnb, the phenomenally successful global lodging website that is now planning to branch out into city tours and other travel experiences. Increasingly the middleman is being cut out of all areas of travel, as tourists enjoy peer-to-peer tours by locals, home-cooked meals, and equipment, car and even boat hire. From January, Spanish start-up Trip4Real \u2013 which is partly bankrolled by Catalan superstar chef Ferran Adri\u00e0 \u2013 plans to launch in London, with at least 150 hosts on its books. The competitor to Vayable already offers 2,500 activities across 50 Spanish cities and shows no sign of slowing down, with further expansion into other European cities \u2013 including Lisbon, Paris and Rome \u2013 to follow soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic combination of offering extra income to locals in difficult times and providing authentic experiences to travellers. It\u2019s not that the desire for authentic travel hasn\u2019t been there before, but big companies can\u2019t deliver it. We have a solution that can,\u201d said Emily Elwes, Trip4Real\u2019s communications manager.

Travellers wanting to join a dinner party or supper club with locals have more choice than ever.

In her first newspaper interview as successor to Britain\u2019s Catherine Ashton , Federica Mogherini, the former Italian foreign minister, told the Guardian that the rebel elections, supported by Moscow and denounced almost everywhere else, were a grave setback to the chances of Russia and Ukraine reaching a deal on the country\u2019s future structure. On her first working day in office as high representative for foreign and security policy, chairing meetings of EU foreign ministers as well as being a vice-president of the new European commission, Mogherini doubted whether the blunt instrument of economic and financial sanctions against Russia, while hurting, were having any impact on Putin\u2019s thinking and behaviour. \u201cThe effect of sanctions on the Russian economy are clear to everybody, first to the Russians and to the Russian leadership, and the surroundings of the Russian leadership, the circle that is close to the Russian political leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real point is, is that going to be the element that is going to change significantly the Russian political attitude towards the crisis? This is still an open question mark and the answer is only in the hands of the Russian authorities. But we need an answer to that question mark before we go on.\u201d Mogherini\u2019s remarks to the Guardian and five other European newspapers will harden suspicions that she is more dovish than hawkish on Putin, in line with Italian foreign policy which has been relatively pro-Russia in recent years. But she denounced the elections in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine as illegal and illegitimate and praised President Petro Poroshenko for his full commitment to the Minsk accords signed this year with Russia, which preserved the territorial integrity of Ukraine while allowing for regional autonomy and local elections in the east. Although the accords have not been properly implemented, EU capitals believe they represent the sole chance of avoiding a much worse conflict in Ukraine. Mogherini worried that the Minsk window may be closing. \u201cWhat happens if the Minsk protocol is dead?\u201d she asked. \u201cI still think that there is enough political will, for sure in Ukraine, and we have to go and test if there is in Moscow commitment to the Minsk protocol. \u201cIf we declare that process dead, what is staying for us to go on with the political side? Obviously the vote was not an encouraging sign \u2026 If this process fails and gets to the point we declare dead the Minsk process, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to start again with a third or fourth exercise of dialogue.\u201d The Italian social democrat, a protege of prime minister Matteo Renzi although she is two years older than him, takes stewardship of European foreign policy at an exacting time, with Putin ditching the modus vivendi prevailing in Europe since the 1989 revolutions and the Soviet collapse, and the EU\u2019s Mediterranean frontier turning into a cemetery for migrants fleeing Africa and the Middle East. She succeeds Ashton, who kept a low public profile, won few friends in Brussels and focused on the Iranian nuclear issue and the Balkans, not being very engaged on the Ukraine crisis where Berlin and Angela Merkel have dominated the diplomacy. \u201cI will be very involved in Ukraine,\u201d pledged Mogherini, while confirming that Berlin now wielded greater clout in the foreign policy councils of the EU, supplanting the British and the French. \u201cI witnessed as a minister in these past months quite a central foreign policy of Germany already. I think this is something positive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean all other 27 foreign policies are less central, but for sure a country that has a history as Germany can play an important role \u2026 I welcome the fact that Germany has for sure shown in the recent past the willingness to involve its strength in European foreign policy.\u201d Mogherini was a relative unknown until eight months ago when Renzi made her Italy\u2019s foreign minister. Despite a long academic and political background fixated on foreign policy, her experience of exercising power, influence and leadership is limited. Similar criticisms were made of Ashton. Both appointments have encouraged suspicions that Europe\u2019s big diplomatic machines are not keen to be put in the shade by a figure of international stature. The job is made harder by the common observation that, when push comes to shove, there is no common or single European foreign policy, simply an aggregate of various, often conflicting national policies. In a spartan office on the 11th floor of the commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters, Mogherini sounded utterly committed to what might turn out to be a thankless task. She demonstrated a quick devotion to Brussels: she is moving her young family to Belgium from Rome at the end of the current school year and is buying a house. She recognises the problems and contradictions of her position, but argues forcefully for a pooling of national foreign policy authority in the interests of efficacy and power projection. \u201cThis can sound as something naive. But if we are together in this union, it\u2019s because we choose to be one in many things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the European Union experience so challenging and also a model. Why did we do this choice? Because we see that we share a common interest and common values. But I would stress interests here, because common values are free \u2026 We do share a common European interest.\u201d She pointed to her title in charge of EU foreign and security policy and warned that the 28 countries should either get real about the mission or drop the idea altogether. Ashton was the first incumbent five years ago after the post was created by the Lisbon treaty. \u201cWe do have to make it real or better cancel the job description and the European Union as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019re kidding ourselves \u2026 We have to be serious and consistent if we believe the European Union makes sense. I believe it makes sense. We have to be consistent and have a common attitude to the challenges around us.\u201d Mogherini has long been engaged in the politics of the Middle East and is sending a signal by heading there on Friday on her first trip in office outside the EU. Israel-Palestine is the focus and she is to spend three days in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Gaza. Sweden\u2019s recent recognition of a Palestinian state did not represent a template for the rest of the EU to follow, she said, admitting that such a move would hold little traction among many of the other 27 EU member states. Establishing rather than recognising a Palestinian state was the point, she said, pointing to the resonance of the issue for the generation of politicians coming to power in Europe. \u201cThere is an entire generation growing up with the Palestinian issue. I mean, I\u2019m 41, I studied politics at 16 and this was the main campaign when I was at school.\u201d The scale of the multiple crises in the Middle East meant that \u201cdifferent actors share a certain sense of urgency and common threat\u201d, creating \u201cmaybe a unique opportunity of putting around the table different actors that so far have not shared a common interest and see if there are some elements that could shape a different regional approach.\u201d With Europe by far the biggest donor to the Palestinian territories, she warned that repeated failures on settlement prospects would erode public support for billions of euros being seen to be wasted there. \u201cYou cannot be a payer without being a political player. This is not sustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could create a certain frustration with European taxpayers, especially in an economic crisis.\u201d But she sounded doggedly optimistic about her visit this weekend. \u201cFor the first time I believe \u2026 they need the European Union to be present in order to make steps forward at this time of their history. This might not have been the case in the past. But at this date I get the same messages from the Palestinian side, from the Israeli side, and from the key Arab countries, exactly in the same terms \u2013 we do need at this time the European Union to move forward.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-11-03T23:00:05Z", "title": "Ukraine rebel elections illegitimate, says new EU foreign policy chief", "sentences": ["Israel-Palestine is the focus and she is to spend three days in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/ukraine-rebel-elections-illegal-eu-mogherini"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Monday\u2019s Tel Aviv derby descended into chaos and was abandoned at half-time after a supporter invaded the pitch and attacked a player, who was subsequently sent off for retaliating.

That is exactly what happened when Spanish compiler Manuel S\u00e1nchez sent me a link to his awesome DJ K-Sets web page. This is one of the best sets of Middle Eastern tapes I\u2019ve come across, and the names of the mixes are enough to tantalise alone: Canaanite Galaxy; Destroy Route; Tel Aviv Bus Station; Tehran Electro Tunes; Iberia Ancient Songs \u2026 I\u2019ll certainly be revisiting this page until I\u2019ve soaked up each and every mix. The first selection that Manuel flagged up to me was the one below, the Popular Kurdish Cassette mix. He said: \u201cFrom 2005 to 2010 I was compiling Kurdish tapes sourced from around Istanbul, Berlin and Aleppo in Syria. I made this mixtape on video to illustrate the tracks with their covers. Not many people have heard this mixtape, and now, when the progressive Kurdish citadel of Kobani is being attacked by the international jihadis, it could be a good moment to show western audiences some aspects of the Kurdish people through their daily music.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more.       Mali: Songhoy Blues \u2013 Al Hassidi Terrei \u201cHey you guys! We\u2019ve got some Malian rock music here, supported to the hilt by Damon Albarn and produced by Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs! Wait! Come Back! Where are you going?!\u201d However you feel about the celebrity endorsement of Malian pop and rock music \u2013 I tend to think it\u2019s all completely OK until Bono turns up for his duet (trigger warning; this cannot be unwatched or unheard) \u2013 Songhoy Blues deserve to be a household name. Their first album Music in Exile is released by Transgressive on 23 February, 2015 and trailing that, this track is taken from their debut single, out on 8 December. Aside from giving your correspondent a raging case of shirt envy, the quality of this clip suggests that the band may just get what they deserve.       Mauritania: Mariem Hassan \u2013 Gdeim Izik This clip of Mariem Hassan performing one of her most popular songs live in Switzerland a couple of years ago is included simply as an excuse to celebrate one of the best African singers performing today. Probably the most feted vocalist to hail from Western Sahara, Hassan was displaced from her family\u2019s nomadic way of life in 1975 in Smara, Spanish Sahara, when she was 17. She became a singer while she was working as a nurse in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Algeria, only leaving for her new home in Spain some 27 years later. She still sings songs calling for the liberation of her occupied home territory and has become a representative voice of all of her people, no matter where they now live.       Egypt: DJ Figo and Cheetos \u2013 Figo Vs Cheetos I have absolutely no information on this banging new chaabi track featuring Chipsy-inspired keyboard stabs, other than the fact I know it\u2019s smoking.

Syria: Bashara! \u2013 Various The competition to stand out as a dabke artist must have been pretty fierce in various Syrian regions up until recently (although one suspects that they currently have bigger fish to fry). These clips of keyboard wizard Bashara go to show that not all of the hype goes to singers such as the awesome Omar Souleyman. He\u2019s clearly an all-rounder, just as good at commanding raves as he is at entertaining at weddings, although there is something almost NSFW about this clip of him playing a keyboard riff with his nose and his tongue.

I did it publicly in an article for the London Evening Standard. My resignation wasn\u2019t a protest against Israeli aggression \u2013 why would they care about such a gesture? \u2013 but aimed, I\u00a0believed, against prominent leftwing English Jews, who, despite the complete contradiction between their espoused values and the\u00a0undemocratic, apartheid and territorially expansionist policies of the so-called Jewish homeland, continued vociferously to support Israel. A\u00a0couple of years earlier, on Question Time, I had also challenged Melanie Phillips over her campaign to force British Muslims to take a loyalty oath, saying: if British Muslims, why not British Jews? But on that occasion, when she had accused me of being an antisemite, I was still able to play my trump card: I\u2019m Jewish. The reaction to my resignation was pretty muted. I did receive an email the\u00a0following morning from a pressure group called Jews for Justice in Palestine, urging me to reconsider on the basis that it was perfectly possible for me to retain my Jewish identity while objecting to the activities of the\u00a0Zionist state. In fact, I\u2019d been surprised by my own apostasy (if it can\u00a0be called that), and it\u2019s only now, having read Shlomo Sand\u2019s elegant and passionately felt essay, that I\u2019ve come to understand why it is I resiled from \u2026 what? This heritage? Or is Jewry a people, a religion, or possibly \u2013 if pejoratively \u2013 a tribe? Sand, a history professor at Tel Aviv\u00a0University, is the author of The Invention of the Jewish People (2009), a\u00a0discursive yet polemical work that systematically undermines the claim that Jewishness is necessary \u2013 let alone sufficient \u2013 to justify the claims of the Israeli state to the territory formerly known as Palestine. Now comes this short, highly personal text, which repurposes some of these arguments to\u00a0serve existential ends; Sand asks the\u00a0question: what, in this day and age,\u00a0exactly is a secular Jew? Born in an\u00a0Austrian displaced persons camp in\u00a01946 to a Jewish mother and a non-Jewish father, he grew up in Israel and continues to identify himself as an Israeli, yet he unearths inconsistencies in the Zionist ideological bricolage that\u00a0explain \u2013 at least in part \u2013 why a state founded on democratic and socialist ideals has descended into bigotry, intolerance and a lopsided form\u00a0of what, I think, can only be termed racism. Sand observes that Theodor Herzl\u00a0and his financial backers were assimilated German Jews, repelled by the Ostjuden who came west, fleeing the Russian pogroms of the late 19th century; the creation of modern Hebrew (which bears scant resemblance to the biblical language) was aimed specifically at replacing Yiddish, which was perceived by the nascent Zionists as the peasant tongue of the shtetl and Pale. In time, the othering these Ashkenazim had imposed on the Ostjuden was reimposed by the emerging Israeli Sabra elite \u2013 many of whom had Eastern European origins \u2013 on post\u20111948 refugees from the Maghreb; Jews who, while more \u201ctraditional\u201d in their lifestyle \u2013 and more observant \u2013 had such demerits as speaking and writing fluent Arabic. According to Sand the contradictions of Israel are implicit in\u00a0its inception: a secular state, established by colonisation and the expropriation of land, its claims to ancient title over Israel/Palestine have no more validity than would an Anglo-Saxon\u2019s \u201cright to return\u201d to Germany (should we opt to exercise it), unless, that is, secular Jews choose to ground them \u2013 as the devout do \u2013 in a contractual arrangement with a supernatural being. Sand dubs the current Israeli position on Jewishness \u201cidentitarian\u201d, or alternatively \u201cethno-Zionism\u201d, and notes that Zionists have reached out to the Jewish diaspora and sought to make \u201cIsrael\u201d a state of mind that anyone, no matter how far flung, can experience \u2013 so long, of course, as she has a Jewish mother. These \u201cnew Jews\u201d, as Sand terms them, can be in Los Angeles or London; they can be religiously unobservant, and possess no recognisably \u201cIsraeli\u201d cultural attributes (because, after all, most of what we term \u201cJewish culture\u201d is in fact the cuisine, the humour and folk tales of the discredited Yiddish-speakers), yet they possess the \u201cright\u201d to settle in Israel \u2013 a right to citizenship, in effect, that is held by the\u00a0Israeli constitution to be logically and morally\u00a0prior to that of Palestine\u2019s indigenous people. Sand dryly observes that were this situation to obtain in our neck of the woods, \u201cBritain would solemnly proclaim that it no longer belonged to any of its British subjects \u2013 the Scots, the Welsh, the citizens descended from\u00a0the immigrants from the former colonies \u2013 but was henceforth the state only of the English, those born of an English mother\u201d. For each element of supposed secular Jewish identity, Sand has a concise dismissal: any talk of Jews as a \u201crace\u201d (not, of course, that most Jews think of themselves as a race) is unfounded: according to Steven Pinker, the \u201cgenetic overlap\u201d between the Ashkenazim and adjacent populations was/is between a third and\u00a0a half depending on which genes you examine. Nor, according to Sand, do most secular Jews look simply to shared language or traditions for their identity; instead, he argues that the most secure foundation of Jewish secular identity since 1945 has been the persecutory criteria that crystallised in the Holocaust \u2013 following Elie Wiesel, he says we \u201cJews\u201d have defined ourselves purely as the sort of people who might be murdered by Nazis, although conveniently downplaying the way that might make Roma, Communists, Poles and homosexuals equally \u201cJewish\u201d. (Yes, I know it can\u00a0be\u00a0argued\u00a0that the specifically genocidal character of the Nazis\u2019 liquidation of European Jewry makes it\u00a0distinct \u2013 but I doubt that argument would cut much ice with their non-Jewish victims.) Really, if you subscribe to Sand\u2019s viewpoint unequivocally, the conclusion has to be that it\u2019s support of\u00a0embattled Israel alone that allows the new Jews to cleave to their old, faithful brethren. I don\u2019t subscribe unequivocally. As I\u00a0said, I had resigned my own Jewishness with considerable perplexity; Sand has clarified my thinking in some\u00a0ways; but while his arguments concerning this identity and its impact on the wider issues raised by the Israeli-Palestine conflict are lucid and logical, they have an apodeictic feel about them that, for all his scrupulous even-handedness, seems to play directly into the binary, and intractably oppositional character of the dispute. Discussing Sand\u2019s views with a variety of self-identifying secular non-Israeli Jews over the last few weeks, I found them stubbornly clinging to their Jewish identity. And why wouldn\u2019t they? They do indeed share powerful and meaningful traditions \u2013 festivals, commemorative meals, holidays, ways\u00a0of speaking and doing \u2013 and if I\u00a0found it easy to resign\u00a0my own Jewishness this was probably because there was very little of this in my natal home, unless you count my mother\u2019s periodic outbursts about the Jews being \u201csmarter than everyone else\u201d, and occasional trips to\u00a0Bloom\u2019s in Golders Green to scoff hot salt beef sandwiches. Besides, whatever the strength of Sand\u2019s underlying logic, what people think they are is undoubtedly their own affair \u2013 to seek\u00a0to deprive people of an identity they cleave to smacks of a peculiar form of abuse. Moreover, surely what\u2019s\u00a0needed when it comes Israel-Palestine is nuance, and a willingness to see the world in greyscale rather than black-and-white. And to acknowledge the wrongs \u2013 indeed, atrocities \u2013 committed on all sides, so\u00a0detaching those corrupted by the exercise of\u00a0violence from the arena of\u00a0policy-making. The last person to look to for such subtlety is Julie Burchill, who\u2019s made \u2013 by her own admission \u2013 a fortune from writing the sort of ad hominem abuse that all too often is passed off as \u201ccomment\u201d in our media. In truth, I\u2019ve\u00a0always thought of Burchill as a sort\u00a0of newsprint Alastair Campbell; just as in his heyday Campbell intimidated the Westminster lobby journalists by flecking their faces with spittle and expletives, so she seems to win newspaper contracts by playing the part of sacredly authentic monster for credulous readers. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t\u00a0really dignify her latest offering with the ascription \u201cbook\u201d, nor the contents therein as \u201cwriting\u201d \u2013 rather they are sophomoric, hammy effusions, wrongheaded, rancorous, and pathetically self-aggrandising. I wasn\u2019t actually aware that Burchill was a philo-Semite of long standing, but if alcoholics are prone to reciting \u201cdrunkalogues\u201d, then we might reasonably describe Unchosen as a similarly tedious \u201cJewalogue\u201d. (And since Burchill descants at such length on her own prodigious drinking and cocaine-sniffing, we might reasonably see it as a drunkalogue too.) There isn\u2019t a shred of reason in this text, which \u2013 one hopes because all the publishers it was offered to turned it down \u2013 has been produced by an imprint funded by subscribers including such beacons of enlightenment as Richard Littlejohn. I really don\u2019t see it as my responsibility as a reviewer to catalogue Burchill\u2019s repugnant gallimaufry of insults and half-baked nonsense; suffice to say, she believes everything the state of Israel does is just peachy, and she uncritically accepts ethno\u2011Zionism, endorsing the idea that\u00a0some schmuck \u2013 such as myself \u2013 who grew up in the Hampstead Garden\u00a0Suburb, has a \u201cright\u201d to my place in the Holy Land in advance of the 1.8 million Palestinians currently penned up in the\u00a0giant internment camp known as \u201cthe Gaza Strip\u201d. When it comes to identifying exactly\u00a0who the \u201cJews\u201d are that she loves so unreservedly, Burchill tellingly rejects one set of stereotypic Ashkenazi characteristics \u2013 humour, chicken soup, kvetching, Woody Allen, fiddling\u00a0on rooftops \u2013 in favour of those \u00a0advanced by the ethno-Zionists: intelligence, IDF machismo, \u201ctrue\u201d democracy, good looks etc. Like the police and social services employees in\u00a0Rotherham who claimed they were inhibited from prosecuting Muslim child-abusers because they feared accusations of racism, Burchill is incapable of understanding that her very exaltation of specific \u2013 and implicitly genetic \u2013 Jewish characteristics plays right into the\u00a0hands of anti-Semites and crypto\u2011Nazis. The imperative in respect of Israeli-Palestine, as in any other dispute where \u201cidentity\u201d is fuelling the conflagration, is to step back and regard the players on all sides first and foremost as people, irrespective of what group they belong\u00a0to. But Burchill\u2019s most egregious fault is\u00a0her insistence that her enemies are all pals together. Time and again in this\u00a0threadbare text she equates any criticism of the Israeli state with support for Hamas, Hezbollah and other organisations that commit terrorist acts in the name of Palestine \u2013 this is wrong, deeply unhelpful, and an attitude that, in my view, could lead ultimately to the destruction of Israel. About 12 years ago I profiled Burchill for the Independent on Sunday. I wrote then that she presented the bizarre spectacle of an intelligent woman who had spent her entire adult life making herself more stupid; this process has now reached its inevitable conclusion, and she has become to all intents and purposes moronic. If I were still a Jew\u00a0I\u00a0might have cause to reject her overtures, but thankfully, having resigned from the club, I\u2019m no longer in any danger of being bothered by this\u00a0particular barroom bore. \u2022 To order How I Stopped Being Jew for \u00a37.99 (RRP \u00a39.99) and Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite for \u00a39.49 (RRP12.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-06T07:30:04Z", "title": "How I Stopped Being a Jew by Shlomo Sand and Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite by Julie Burchill \u2013 review ", "sentences": ["Sand, a history professor at Tel Aviv\u00a0University, is the author of The Invention of the Jewish People (2009), a\u00a0discursive yet polemical work that systematically undermines the claim that Jewishness is necessary \u2013 let alone sufficient \u2013 to justify the claims of the Israeli state to the territory formerly known as Palestine."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/06/how-i-stopped-being-a-jew-shlomo-sand-unchosen-julie-burchill-review"}, {"tags": ["Oil", "Commodities", "Business", "Cyprus", "Europe", "World news", "Greece", "Turkey", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Joe Biden"], "article": "Tensions have risen in the eastern Mediterranean with an escalating war of words between Athens, Ankara and Nicosia over oil and gas reserves in the region. Wrangling over hydrocarbons to be found in the area\u2019s waters, has intensified after the leaders of Greece, Cyprus and Egypt signed an agreement in Cairo on Saturday to boost energy cooperation. Within minutes of the accord being announced Cyprus\u2019s president, Nicos Anastasiades, accused Turkey of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d for sending a surveillance vessel and war ships to search for natural resources in the island\u2019s exclusive economic zone. \u201cTurkey\u2019s provocative actions do not just compromise the peace talks,\u201d he said, referring to UN-brokered reunification negotiations suspended by his government last month. \u201c[They] also affect security in the eastern Mediterranean region.\u201d Talks aimed at reuniting Greek and Turkish Cypriots were restarted earlier this year after a 10-year hiatus amid expectation that the under-sea reserves would facilitate resolution of the west\u2019s longest-running diplomatic dispute. With pipelines to be built through Turkey \u2013 by far the cheapest and most effective way of transferring the oil and gas to Europe \u2013 seasoned Cyprus watchers spoke of a potential game-changer. In May, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, underscored those hopes with the first visit to the island by a senior US official in almost 50 years. But instead of galvanising the feuding communities to conciliate, the prospect of finding alternative energy supplies appears to have widened the gulf between them. Turkey\u2019s decision to dispatch a research vessel into disputed waters last month not only resulted in talks being broken off but has exacerbated the row over drilling rights. On Sunday the head of the Turkish navy, Admiral B\u00fclent Bostano\u011flu, revealed he had been handed new rules of engagement in the event of \u201ca situation\u201d involving hydrocarbons in the eastern Mediterranean. \u201cWe will move according to the rules of engagement that have been given us,\u201d he said when asked how Turkey\u2019s navy would react if it encountered a Greek or Israeli ship in the region.  On Monday, a senior Greek military official was quoted in the daily paper To Vima as saying: \u201cWe have rules of engagement, too, that have been approved by the prime minister and the cabinet, not only just in the Aegean but the south-east Mediterranean for the defence of our national interests.\u201d  Although the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is unrecognised internationally, Ankara, its mainstay of financial and moral support,insists the statelet should also be participating in the exploration drive. Raising the alarm during a recent visit to Athens, the island\u2019s newly appointed UN representative, Espen Bard Elder, appealed for calm. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is actually quite dangerous and I encourage everyone to do their best to avoid any kind of further escalation,\u201d he said. But the region\u2019s shifting alliances \u2013 symbolised by the accord signed in Cairo on Saturday \u2013 is unlikely to placate Turkey, already unnerved by events on its eastern front involving Islamic State (Isis). The agreement was arrived at days after Israel stepped up security cooperation with Cyprus. After the discovery of its own vast reserves, Tel Aviv desperately needs safe export routes through pipelines that go via the island. Visiting Nicosia last week the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, lambasted Turkey for intruding on Cyprus\u2019s exclusive economic zone \u2013 criticism echoed by the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, when he too held talks in the capital on Friday. Ankara, which sees itself as the region\u2019s burgeoning economic powerhouse, has signalled that it will respond in kind. Before a visit to the Turkish capital by the US vice-president later this month, it has conveyed its displeasure at the signing of the Cairo accord. \u201cTension is definitely on the rise,\u201d said Hubert Faussmann, associate professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \u201cThe peace talks have become a victim of the hydrocarbons which are inseparably linked to the Cyprus problem. They have escalated rather than de-escalated the situation,\u201d he told the Guardian from Nicosia.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-10T10:05:18Z", "title": "Oil and gas reserves around Cyprus give Greece and Turkey more to fight about", "sentences": ["After the discovery of its own vast reserves, Tel Aviv desperately needs safe export routes through pipelines that go via the island."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/10/oil-gas-reserves-cyprus-greece-turkey"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Behind the campus of the Hebrew University a scrubby hill drops steeply to the East Jerusalem village of Isawiya. Two weeks ago a squad of riot police was hiking down the path to the first houses. Who the police were chasing was evident immediately: handfuls of Palestinian youths \u2013 many very young \u2013 one group jogging across the cemetery below trying to approach close enough to throw their stones. A week later \u2013 and a few short miles away across the city \u2013 it was a different scene: an arm under a plastic sheet was all that was visible of Ibrahim al-Akari, lying where he was shot after driving his van through two groups of pedestrians at a tram stop in Jerusalem, killing two. These scenes connect two of the dots in Jerusalem\u2019s increasingly violent tensions of recent months which \u2013 in the past three weeks \u2013 have threatened to metamorphose into something more dangerous. A background of continued provocation on both sides since mid-summer has created the context for more serious events, including two lethal hit-and-run attacks and the attempted assassination of a far-right Jewish religious activist \u2013 Yehuda Glick \u2013 all in Jerusalem. Among those killed in the hit-and-run attacks have been a three-month-old child, Chaya Zissel Braun, struck in her stroller, a Druze border policeman, Jedan Assad, and a 17-year-old religious student, Shalom Baadani.     Israeli Border Police take position overlooking the east Jerusalem Arab neighborhood of Issawiya today Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    It is a violence that now appears to be spreading: to Israel\u2019s Arab towns, after a man was shot dead by police while being arrested, and to Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank \u2013 the scene of two fatal stabbings by Palestinians of Israelis on Monday. If the clashes and attacks reflect overlapping discontents, there is one issue that appears to be acting as the most dangerous accelerant \u2013 a campaign for Jewish prayer access by a minority of religious rightwingers at the site in the Old City known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and revered as the third holiest site in Islam, and to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the Second Temple. Although the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and other senior Israeli politicians insist there is no plan to change the \u201cstatus quo\u201d there \u2013 which allows Jews and Christians to visit at certain hours but not to pray \u2013 that campaign, which has included visits by prominent MPs, has escalated tensions.       That in turn recently saw the first full closure of the site by Israeli police in decades, and a police raid into the building of al-Aqsa mosque itself \u2013 an event that led to widespread outrage in the Muslim community. The increase in violence has imposed itself on the city\u2019s life in different ways. Unlike during the second intifada, when suicide bombers came into the centre of Jerusalem, the most serious of the recent attacks have taken place along the line that divides occupied east and west, Palestinian and Jew. For those living in many central areas the sound of police stun grenades and teargas on one side, and firecrackers let off by Palestinian youths on the other, has become an almost nightly ritual. Hundreds of extra police have been drafted into the city and observation balloons deployed above the flashpoint neighbourhoods. Concrete blocks have been placed on the platforms of tram stops to stop cars being driven into passengers. For now restaurants and bars in the west are still busy, although some Tel Aviv schools \u2013 to the anger of officials \u2013 have cancelled school trips to the city. \u201cIt\u2019s not like when I was a teenager during the last intifada,\u201d says Irit, a municipal worker, waiting at a bus stop not far from central Jaffa Street, who declines to give her second name. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad yet. But I\u2019m more wary now in public places.\u201d Others talk of not using the light rail or avoiding driving on roads where stones might be thrown. It is a sense of anxiety echoed up by the columnist Alex Fishman, writing in Yedioth Ahronoth on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the same soundtrack that we all remember from the days of the [second] intifada: you haven\u2019t yet had time to come to terms with the morning\u2019s terror attack and you\u2019re already wallowing in the next one \u2026 And you\u2019ve come to feel that same oppressive sense of threat to your personal safety, and everyone, without waiting for instructions from above, begins to ask themselves: should I or shouldn\u2019t I drive into Jerusalem? Should I or shouldn\u2019t I board the bus? Should I or shouldn\u2019t I wait at the train station?\u201d     Israeli police detain a Palestinian youth following clashes after Friday prayers in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Wadi al-Joz Photograph: Finbarr O'Reilly/Reuters    On the Palestinian side there is an equal nervousness still lingering from the summer when rightwing gangs launched a series of attacks against Palestinians. And another difference with the second intifada \u2013 as police officials and observers note \u2013 is that those carrying out the recent attacks appear not to have been organised and sent by militant groups but have decided to act on their own. David Tsur, an Israeli MP from the party of the justice minister, Tzipi Livni, and a former commander of the border police, acknowledges blame on both sides, identifying an intersection of causes. \u201cOne is that there is no future in the peace negotiations of any kind. Discussions and channels between [the Palestinian president] Mahmoud Abbas and Binyamin Netanyahu are almost non-existent. That is one of the main reasons why this is escalating. \u201cThen there is the Temple Mount issue, which has not been handled sensitively enough.\u201d In common with many Israeli political figures, however, Tsur blames Abbas for raising the heat in East Jerusalem while keeping things quiet in the West Bank \u2013 where unrest might threaten him. If there is an irony in what is happening, it is that it is largely occurring inside the huge expanse of the concrete separation wall Israel built at the end of the second intifada to minimise attacks. And if Ibrahim al-Akari\u2019s hit-and-run attack last week marked a turning point of sorts, it has been because of two discrete and linked reasons. Unlike after previous incidents, Akari\u2019s family made no attempt to deny what he had done. Instead they linked it directly to the Israeli raid into al-Aqsa last Thursday morning which they said had prompted his actions. \u201cMy brother was a simple man,\u201d said Ayoub al-Akari at the mourning tent. \u201cHe was very religious but he didn\u2019t belong to any of the factions. This all started with the killing of the child Mohammad Abu Khdeir during the summer [by Jewish extremists] \u2026 The war in Gaza made things worse. Then there was the raid on al-Aqsa.\u201d     Women shout slogans in front of the Dome of the Rock, near the al-Aqsa mosque where a police raid led to widespread outrage in the Muslim community. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    And despite what the Israeli government has said, many Palestinians do not believe there is no plan to change the status quo at the Noble Sanctuary. The grand mufti of al-Aqsa, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, told the Guardian: \u201cThe problem has been the daily raids and assaults on al-Aqsa and the damage that has been done. The recent raid and closure are unprecedented in recent memory.\u201d The mufti, like many, doubts the insistence by Netanyahu that Israel does not want to change the status quo. \u201cIt is propaganda when they keep allowing settlers to enter the Noble Sanctuary. They are planning something. To divide it, perhaps. Al-Aqsa is a place for Muslims to pray. No one is allowed to share it.\u201d Most dangerous of all, perhaps, is how a dynamic of action and reaction appears to be driving the escalation. The decision to flood Jerusalem with police reinforcements and new rushed legislation \u2013 including a sentence of up to 20 years for stone throwing \u2013 appear to have pushed Jerusalem closer to the edge. Silwan, tucked in a deep cleft below the walls of the Old City, has long been on the frontline. That boiled over once again with the arrival, in the middle of the night last month, of Jewish settler families to take occupation of houses they had bought \u2013 by subterfuge, Palestinians allege. It was the home too of Abdulrahman al-Shaludi, driver in the first of the two recent hit-and-run attacks, which claimed the lives of two pedestrians. Sami Qaraeen, a mechanic, told the Guardian the large police presence had only angered people more. \u201cIf you walk around you will see all the police they have sent in to swamp the neighbourhood. They having been going from house to house looking for the kids involved in the clashes. It is unprecedented. They have undercover snatch squads and have set up an observation balloon. This afternoon they arrested five more. Now they say they will fine parents. They are introducing new laws almost every day.\u201d There is little sign it is discouraging the clashes. Back in Shuafat refugee camp last Friday at a junction facing the main checkpoint, several hundred youths had gathered to throw stones and firecrackers at police who replied with plastic rounds and teargas. A masked teenage boy explained why he was there. \u201cWe are here for the sake of the martyr [Ibrahim al-Akari]. And because al-Aqsa means a lot to us. Because of that we are trying to provoke them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2014.

Having left her previous job under a cloud, Fisher has everything to prove when tasked with investigating the disappearance of student Polly Sinclair, last seen in a state of inebriation outside a Colchester bar. When another student is murdered after an evening\u2019s drinking, Fisher begins to wonder if there might be a connection. Good Girls Don\u2019t Die, which gets Grey\u2019s projected series off to a flying start, is assured, convincing and especially good on the contentious areas of contributory negligence and the delicate \u2013 and often dodgy \u2013 nature of the relationship between the police and the press. More, please. Swedish bestseller Henning Mankell announced that The Troubled Man, published in English in 2011, was to be the last Kurt Wallander novel. The good news for those suffering withdrawal symptoms is that An Event in Autumn (translated by Laurie Thompson, Harvill Secker, \u00a39.99) is a never-before-published novella featuring the gloomy old sod, with an interesting afterword from the author about his decision to write crime fiction and the creation of his most famous character. The story is set in 2002, when Wallander, taking stock of his life, has decided that he needs to move house. The country home that a colleague is selling on behalf of a relative seems ideal \u2013 until Wallander trips over a skeleton hand sticking out of the soil in the garden. It turns out that not one, but two, murder victims have lain there for decades, apparently unmissed. Things become somewhat implausible towards the end, but the mystery is engaging, with many reflections on the all-conquering nature of time along the way. The second novel from Israeli author DA Mishani, A Possibility of Violence (translated by Todd Hasak-Lowy, Quercus, \u00a316.99), definitely lives up to the promise of its excellent predecessor, The Missing File. Back from a long summer holiday, Inspector Avraham Avraham of the Tel Aviv police conducts an inquiry into a suspicious device found outside a children\u2019s nursery. There\u2019s an eyewitness description of a man who fled the scene but not enough evidence to detain him, so Avraham\u2019s focus shifts to Chaim Sara, father of one of the young attendees. Sara, whose wife seems to have disappeared, is certainly peculiar, but then so is the abrasive Chava Cohen, owner of the nursery. Strong on police procedure and quotidian detail, with a refreshingly average and self-doubting protagonist, A Possibility of Violence is both tense and touching. Three-times winner of the Crime Writers\u2019 Association Historical Dagger, Andrew Taylor has produced another pitch-perfect mystery, this time set during the French revolution. The Silent Boy (HarperCollins, \u00a316.99) is the story of young Charles who, rendered mute by the shock of witnessing the murder of his mother in Paris, is brought to England by an aristocratic \u00e9migr\u00e9. Charles\u2019s mother Augusta was the estranged wife of Edward Savill, who, acting on behalf of Augusta\u2019s uncle, goes on to claim the boy. Just when Savill believes he has won the ensuing custody battle, Charles, who, despite the best efforts of science and religion, remains speechless, is abducted. Taylor has not only succeeded in constructing a labyrinthine plot that is gripping to the last page, but he has also created an entirely believable child, traumatised but resolute, whose plight is the fuel for true suspense. Another distressed child holds the clue \u2013 literally, this time \u2013 to the mystery in Winter Siege, which is, sadly, the final novel from the late Ariana Franklin, seamlessly completed by her daughter Samantha Norman (Bantam Press, \u00a316.99). It is 1141 and Stephen and Matilda are fighting for the crown. England is full of mercenaries happy to change sides at the drop of a groat and nobility who are in constant danger of being forced into switching allegiance. Compared with Franklin\u2019s previous novels, the mystery element, centring on the parchment that poor 11-year-old Em, raped and left for dead, is clutching in her hand, is fairly slight, but it is a strongly flavoured tale, thoroughly researched and well imagined, and the siege itself is magnificently vivid and exciting. Murder Underground by Mavis Doriel Hay (British Library, \u00a38.99) is one of a number of forgotten \u201cgolden age\u201d detective novels being reissued by British Library Crime Classics. Set in 1934, the year of original publication, when rush hour barely existed, let alone lasted for most of the day, it begins when Miss Euphemia Pongleton, resident at the Frampton private hotel, is found strangled on the stairs at Belsize Park underground station. This is mystery presented as emotionally neutral puzzle, and some readers may find the what-larks flippancy and breezy snobbery a bit much, but it\u2019s an enjoyable period piece, as are Hay\u2019s other two novels, Death on the Cherwell and The Santa Klaus Murder, also reissued. \u2022 To order these titles with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to bookshop.theguardian.com.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-14T07:00:02Z", "title": "The best crime novels \u2013 review roundup", "sentences": ["Back from a long summer holiday, Inspector Avraham Avraham of the Tel Aviv police conducts an inquiry into a suspicious device found outside a children\u2019s nursery."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/14/best-crime-novels-review-roundup"}, {"tags": ["Euro 2016 qualifiers", "Football", "Sport", "Germany", "Gibraltar", "Republic of Ireland", "Scotland", "Romania", "Northern Ireland", "Holland", "Latvia", "Belgium", "Wales", "Croatia", "Italy", "Armenia", "Portugal", "England", "Israel"], "article": "1) Will Germany serve up a cricket score?

And what high stakes in the match! Group D is the toughest in Europe and although Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and Poland are all as capable of winning away to each other as they are at home, defeat by one against the other would feel like a major setback. Gordon Strachan is likely to go wholeheartedly for the win, while Martin O\u2019Neill will probably take a more cautious approach as usual, sitting deep in Glasgow in a bid to neutralise two of Scotland\u2019s most potent weapons, the pace of Ikechi Anya and the canny movement of Steven Naismith. This week\u2019s headlines about Roy Keane and an irrelevant incident in the team hotel were worth nobody\u2019s time; far more significant is the loss through injury of Ireland\u2019s first-choice midfielders, Glenn Whelan and James McCarthy. Jeff Hendrick and Darron Gibson should be deployed instead, each offering a goal threat on top of their other work. However, the visitors\u2019 most likely source of a goal, especially in view of Scotland\u2019s injuries at full-back, will be another Everton player: and we can surely all agree \u2013 particularly if some Scottish fans emit the sort of guff that halfwits such as Gordon McQueen have been calling for this week \u2013 that a winning goal from Aiden McGeady would be a beautiful thing to behold.

The Romanian FA reacted by turning once again to Anghel Iordanescu, who has twice led the country previously. Iordanescu is part of the reason why Al Ittihad like Romanian managers, as he enjoyed a successful spell there nearly a decade ago before, in 2007, retiring from football to pursue a career in politics. Now he has been brought back to football and showed that he is not out of touch by previewing this weekend\u2019s clash with the Group F leaders by saying: \u201cThe match against Northern Ireland is extremely important. They have some players who can make the difference. It is a team which is very dangerous on the counterattack.\u201d Iordanescu says that his team will play in the same system that Piturca\u2019s did as Romania rose to second place in the group \u201cbut in a much more offensive manner\u201d. Manchester United\u2019s Paddy McNair, then, could be in line for a demanding debut.

But two defeats from their first three matches mean Holland are in serious need of a home victory over Latvia on Sunday. The build-up has not gone well, their 3-2 home defeat in Wednesday\u2019s friendly against Mexico highlighting the recurrent defensive problems of a team that has now conceded 10 goals in their last five matches. Defeat to a depleted Latvia team seems unlikely but if the Dutch do lose, then Guus Hiddink will be out of a job: that\u2019s not media speculation, that is what the manager himself has said. \u201cIf we lose, it makes sense that I leave,\u201d said the 68-year-old. PD  \u2022 Hiddink: I will quit if we lose to Latvia  5) Belgium must find balance against Wales  Belgium manager Marc Wilmots emerged from the summer\u2019s World Cup with one conviction: he needed to tinker with his team to make it more attacking. But Wilmots emerged from Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 friendly win over Iceland with another conviction: he needs to tinker with his team to make it more defensive. \u201cWe gave our opponents too many chances,\u201d groaned Wilmots following a contest in which his goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, was voted man of the match. \u201cI took the risk of going man to man at the back. [Toby] Alderweireld and [Nicolas] Lombaerts did what they are supposed to do but if the full-backs push up too high, then we get stretched in the middle and are left vulnerable.\u201d Wilmots said that he will instruct his full-backs to be less adventurous against Wales on Sunday and will also scrap the plan in which Axel Witsel plays as an advanced midfielder, instead using him in his more familiar holding role on Sunday. Meanwhile, it will be interesting to see who leads Belgium\u2019s attack against the Welsh: Christian Benteke established himself as first-choice before his injury and the Aston Villa striker impressed on his return on Wednesday, though his two rivals for a starting spot, Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi, both scored.

Here\u2019s the why: Italy\u2019s midfield will be shorn of two key creative midfielders, Andrea Pirlo and Marco Verrati, while Croatia will send out Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Mateo Kovacic. With Mario Balotelli having been recalled by Italy and Dejan Lovren in line to play for Croatia, you can bill this as a clash of the Liverpool flops if you really want to, but this game will be decided by the visitors\u2019 superior midfield.

Any investigator will tell you that a key step to solving a crime is to determine who stands to benefit from it. But that might lead amateur sleuths to the conclusion that Cristiano Ronaldo was behind that chaotic drone stunt in Belgrade last month, and we wouldn\u2019t want to go around spreading that sort of rumour now, would we? Still, there can be no denying that the decision to punish both Serbia and Albania could boost Portugal\u2019s qualification chances if it is upheld, and that is just as well for Ronaldo &amp; co, who look like they could do with all the help they can get. Armenia are an inconsistent side but possess plenty of quality and could spring a surprise on Friday to make things tough for Portugal again.

The fans know it and much as they might intimate otherwise, much as they might try convincing themselves otherwise, the players and manager know it too. But what all three parties also know, with almost equal certainty, is that failure will follow. And not failure as in failing to win a competition, rather failure as in failing to extract the most from the raw materials \u2013 because, despite apparent evidence, England needn\u2019t be rubbish. They have a decent goalkeeper, promising full-backs, and an experienced, Champions League-winning centre-back \u2013 and in front of them, pace, invention, trickery and energy. Yet, under Roy Hodgson, there have been barely a handful of decent performances, and in tournament football, none. Now, though, he has an opportunity to determine his most cohesive XI and inculcate the method that suits it best; if, in the summer of 2016, England do not beat the teams that they should and compete seriously against those that they shouldn\u2019t, the majority of the blame will rest upon one man.

Consider, for example, this remarkable sentence borrowed from its own website: \u201cFor television rights reasons, England, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands had to be in six-team sections\u201d. Additionally, given a competition expanded from 16 to 24 teams, it has become impossible, rather than hard, to imagine one of the richer nations missing out. But, though the integrity of the draw has been compromised, the intrigue of its outcome has intensified; nations who would never have imagined themselves at the finals are now in with a genuine chance. And the yen is particularly acute in Group B, likely to be won by Belgium, but where the tussle between Israel, Cyprus, Wales and Bosnia-Herzegovina is impossible to call. Israel have competed in only one major tournament \u2013 the 1970 World Cup \u2013 and having won in Nicosia already, will put themselves in a very strong position if they can beat Bosnia-Herzegovina, who have already lost to Cyprus. Crucial to their efforts will be Omer Damari, a speedy and skilful centre-forward whose 28 goals last season earned him a move from Hapoel Tel Aviv to Austria Vienna. And Damari has settled immediately, scoring seven in 11 games, as well as four in two at international level. On the other hand, Edin Dzeko, his opposite number, will be absent with a calf strain, which is to say that this game has come at the right time for Israel; now, they must exploit their preferential circumstance. DH 10) Time for a new guard in Spain     Vicente del Bosque speaks in Madrid before the game with Belarus. Photograph: Emilio Naranjo/EPA    In the history of sport, there have been few teams less beatable than the Spain side which won three consecutive tournaments. This was due principally to a midfield able to retain possession well enough such that a dodgy defence was barely ever tested. But with Xavi retired from international football and players like Koke and Diego Costa in the process of establishing themselves, Vicente del Bosque will need to develop a new, more direct style \u2013 regardless of Costa\u2019s unavailability for Saturday night\u2019s game at home to Belarus. The problem, of course, is that this will expose a back-five whose mainstay, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, is out of favour at club level \u2013 with good reason \u2013 and whose goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, is clearly past his best. Will Del Bosque have the courage to omit two men who have served him well, or will he continue to persevere, secure in the knowledge that Spain will reach France, regardless?

Chief surgeon Mads Gilbert, 67, has spent 15 years treating patients in Gaza and spent 51 days in Shifa hospital earlier this year treating many of the 11,000 Palestinians who were wounded in the war between Hamas and Israel. When he returned last month to try and enter Gaza via the Erez crossing in Israel he was denied entry indefinitely. The Israeli government now says Gilbert is banned from entering Gaza for security reasons. The Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv has taken up Gilbert\u2019s case on his behalf after he was refused entry in October. \u201cWhen we came back to the Erez border station the Israeli soldiers told me I was not allowed to go into Gaza,\u201d he told media. \u201cI had a valid permit for multiple entries, an invitation from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and a recommendation from the director at my hospital.\u201d In a written statement, Norway\u2019s Secretary of State, Bard Glad Pedersen, said: \u201cFrom the Norwegian perspective, we have raised Gilbert\u2019s exclusion from Gaza and asked Israel to change their decision. The humanitarian situation is still difficult and there is a need for all health workers.\u201d Norwegian authorities confirmed Gilbert had been banned \u201cindefinitely\u201d by Israel. Gilbert is a vocal critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the blockade on the Gaza Strip. Photos and television footage of Gilbert in his light green surgical wear in Gaza\u2019s Shifa hospital treating Gazans wounded and dying were broadcast internationally and often daily during the course of the war between Hamas and Israel. He vowed he would fight any restrictions placed on his movements by Israel. \u201cI have never violated Israeli law, never been arrested and never lied.\u201d In July Gilbert wrote a statement from Shifa hospital at the height of the fighting that was published widely. He described in graphic detail people that had been \u201cmaimed and torn apart\u201d. He described the patients he treated as being innocent civilians. \u201cWe still have lakes of blood on the floor in the emergency room, piles of dripping blood soaked bandages to clear out. Cleaners are everywhere swiftly shoveling the blood and discarded tissues, hair, clothes, cannulas, and the leftovers from death \u2013 all taken away to be prepared again to be repeated all over.\u201d He called on readers to force Israeli to stop its attacks on Gaza. Dr Gilbert gave a similar account during live television interviews. Gilbert is defiant in responding to the ban and resolved to make a return to Gaza in the near future. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable to restrict the movement of humanitarian personnel \u2013 much needed in Gaza now after the last bombardment,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not be stopped from returning to Gaza to do medical work. There are different attempts going on to conceal the reality on the ground for the good people of Gaza \u2013 this is one of them \u2013 and we must persist in resisting attempts to shutdown Gaza from the world. \u201cThe first precondition for the recent ceasefire was to ease the siege,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not been eased. This attempt to stop medical personnel entering Gaza is a tightening of the siege \u2013 this, again, is totally unacceptable.\u201d During the war, Gilbert charged that Israel was committing \u201cstate terrorism at the highest levels\u201d. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Paul Hirschson, replied Dr Gilbert was \u201cnot on the side of decency and peace and he\u2019s got a horrible track record. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his acquaintances are among the worst people in the world.\u201d During Israel\u2019s 51-day military operation in Gaza over 2,000 Palestinians were killed \u2013 mostly civilians, and 70 Israelis were killed, mostly soldiers. A ceasefire deal was struck at the end of August to bring an end to fighting. Dr Gilbert said the agreement had not been upheld and called his ban on entering Gaza as further evidence a blockade on the coastal enclave was no closer.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-15T17:37:27Z", "title": "Trauma surgeon Mads Gilbert will defy Israeli ban on Gaza entry", "sentences": ["The Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv has taken up Gilbert\u2019s case on his behalf after he was refused entry in October."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/15/mads-gilbert-surgeon-gaza-israel"}, {"tags": ["Metropolitan police", "London", "Police", "UK news", "Protest", "Anonymous", "Hacking", "Technology"], "article": "The Metropolitan police have issued photographs of 12 people they want to question in relation to what they have described as a \u201cconcerted violent attack\u201d on officers during a protest in Parliament Square.

Many people wore the Guy Fawkes masks which have become a symbol of the hacktivist group. The London protest, which Anonymous said was attended by around 3,000 people, spread from Parliament Square to Marylebone. It attracted a range of participants, including supporters of anti-capitalist, anti-war and pro-Palestinian movements. The comedian Russell Brand was among the marchers. Ten people were arrested on the day for offences including assault on police, obstruction offences, attempted grievous bodily harm, and public order offences. The violence in Parliament Square took place between 7pm and 8pm. Anonymous said there were Million Mask Marches in 481 locations this year and has claimed it is the largest global protest.

Yes, the Atlanta band have heavy riffs, big solos and double-tracked guitars, but they also know when to tone it down. Never mind the big dragon on the cover of their new one, Once More \u2019Round The Sun, they don\u2019t solely explore a sword and sorcery world, but also get into some meditative Radiohead-style guitar playing. This is a group with tattooed heads playing heavy rock in a place where much beer has been consumed, but there\u2019s still plenty to investigate. Various venues JR Lily Allen, On tour These days, Lily Allen is as much critic as pop star: her Sheezus album has so many reference points (Lorde, Rihanna, Katy Perry and Kurt Cobain all appear in the first 10 minutes), it\u2019s as though it\u2019s both cultural review and musical statement. There was a time when Allen seemed hipper than that, but having lived her life in the public eye for so long, it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s been drawn to the celebrity recipe of self-reference and kneejerk defensiveness. While that makes her records a bit less interesting than they once were, live she has incorporated it all seamlessly into her act. At the Glastonbury festival this year, she brought her usual blend of impish irreverence and old-time stagecraft, while one imagines that this comprehensive tour should reconnect her with her real fans. Various venues JR Sharon Van Etten, On tour Other artists make albums, Sharon Van Etten releases broken hearts. Unafraid of airing her rawest feelings, the singer\u2019s work draws heavily on her personal life, most of her records being written in the aftermath of romantic disappointment. Not that she\u2019s some kind of weepy sadsack; Van Etten goes after the blood and guts of a song, her voice capable of great power as well as aching vulnerability. Misery loves company, and so far Van Etten has found staunch collaborators from all sections of the secondhand bookstore of US indie rock: the National on 2012\u2019s Tramp, and now the War On Drugs and Okkervil River alumni on new one Are We There. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s about succeeding on her own terms: this latest work has brought Van Etten her biggest success yet.

Formed in 2002, they have been staging this wide-ranging festival for seven years, bringing together some of the best (but not always the best known) experimenting and improvising musicians around. This year\u2019s lineup holds promise, with a performance by political vocal improviser and performer Maggie Nicols; a new piece by conductor Ilan Volkov with Tel Aviv-born pianist and vocalist Maya Dunietz (and check out her Nina Simone performance piece on YouTube); while John Butcher pairs his feathery sax with percussion by Tom Waits and John Zorn collaborator Gino Robair.

This high-profile gig on the final weekend of the London jazz festival pays tribute to a unique story. Two of the label\u2019s most creative keyboardists, the visionary and virtuosic Jason Moran and popular jazz/hip-hop crossover artist Robert Glasper, play the first half as a freewheeling, improvising duet, shuffling and splicing everything from traditional boogie-woogie to free-improv and funk. The second set assembles a superband of rising Blue Note stars, including Glasper, trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, guitarist Lionel Loueke and bassist Derrick Hodge, fusing visions of how 21st-century jazz might sound with a collective sense of the music\u2019s past.

Since then, many of Dillon\u2019s works have received their premieres at the festival, and it has acted as an increasingly important British showcase for his music since he went to live and teach in the US seven years ago.

That\u2019s a prospect soon to be facing Aziz Ansari, when NBC\u2019s Parks And Recreation finishes next year. He has played deluded self-starter Tom Haverford for the last six years, benefiting from the smart writing and brilliant ensemble performances that have made the show a hip name to drop both here and in the States. But he\u2019s certainly got a lot to offer outside of the confines of sitcomland. His stage persona sees him appearing as a kind of nerdy manchild, riddled with personality weaknesses and reduced to endlessly baiting his teenage cousin Harris just so he can reach a position of superiority over someone. The sensitive, easily mocked Harris is a genius comic creation, and Ansari\u2019s accounts of their many puerile battles achieve a grandeur that is not far short of epic. Eventim Apollo, W6, Sun UK Jewish Comedy Festival, London There\u2019s a grand tradition of distinctively Jewish comedy on the other side of the Atlantic, from Catskills comics such as Milton Berle and Sid Caesar through to modern-day stand-ups who find their Jewish ethnicity a rich source of gags.

He\u2019s one of the participants in this week\u2019s inaugural UK Jewish comedy festival, appearing on Thursday in conversation with veteran alternative comic Arnold Brown. Other events include David Baddiel (6 Dec) and Ruby Wax (Mon); tributes to Joan Rivers (7 Dec) and When Harry Met Sally\u2026 (Tue); and an appearance by Odelia Yakir (Wed), an Israeli stand-up who performs entirely in Hebrew.

It\u2019s popular in the sense that lots of performers do it; unfortunately, very few do it well. But that\u2019s not to damn the entire genre. Like puns, lyric-swaps can be teeth-grindingly awful in the wrong hands, and hysterically funny in those of a master craftsman. Such a man is Adam Kay, writer, pianist and frontman of Amateur Transplants. What Kay has over the rest is a flair for the genuinely unexpected and the slightly macabre (such as when he turns power ballad cliche Total Eclipse Of The Heart into a tribute to bored anaesthetists). He\u2019s best known for his swingeing attack on striking tube drivers set to the melody of the Jam\u2019s Going Underground, but he has only grown in strength and confidence as a writer and performer since then: the new stuff\u2019s even better.

Sunday brought revelations of a dossier of new allegations. There\u2019s\u00a0the allegedly corrupt means by which Qatar is rumoured to have \u201cbought\u201d the tournament, the deaths of more than 2,000 migrant workers who have toiled in slave-like conditions and, of course, Qatar\u2019s weather. The\u00a0tournament is to be held in summer when temperatures routinely soar above 40C, posing risks to the players as well as to millions of visiting fans. Many people feel Qatar should not host the tournament. But how to bring this about with Qatar\u2019s consent, without the emirate losing face \u2013 such an important consideration in the Arab\u00a0world \u2013 and bringing multiple legal\u00a0challenges? Here\u2019s one idea: Qatar should take the high ground by announcing that it will heed calls by an outgoing Fifa official for\u00a0the tournament to be moved to other Arab lands. It should give the World Cup to Gaza. And Qatar should pay for it too. The idea is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Gaza\u2019s key problem is not money, but rule by militant Islamism, combined with hopelessness. Indeed, Gaza has received billions in aid over the years \u2013 but its Hamas rulers have never shared this properly with the population. The Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, among others, flies around in a Qatari-provided private jet. Recently Forbes rated Hamas \u201cthe second richest terrorist group in the world\u201d \u2013 poorer than Isis but considerably richer than the Taliban and\u00a0other groups. As long as Hamas maintains its grip on the territory Israel will respond with force. So how to prevent the next Gaza war? For the first time in history almost the entire Arab world backed Israel \u2013 albeit tacitly \u2013 in last summer\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The one exception was Qatar (as well as non-Arab regimes in Turkey and Iran). And consider this. Football is almost a secular religion for millions of people throughout the world. I know from my own visits there that Gaza is no exception. (Readers may have noticed from photos during the recent conflict how many Gazans were wearing the shirts of leading European teams.) What other force is great enough to\u00a0pull Gazans from the lure of Hamas, restore a sense of pride and purpose, create thousands of jobs, and direct billions of dollars into the territory \u2013 to be used to transform the strip into a prime Mediterranean tourist hub? Hamas would, of course, object but football is such a powerful force in Gazan society that it would be hard even\u00a0for the its leadership to justify to\u00a0its own people its continued focus on\u00a0jihadi activities. Such an idea may sound implausible at first, but only if you disregard other historical examples of the healing power of football. For example, the \u201cMiracle of Berne\u201d in 1954 when West Germany won the World Cup, a victory that played a role in reviving the country and accelerating its economic recovery. \u201cIn the days after the game,\u201d Uli Hesse, the respected German journalist, wrote, \u201cthe country celebrated like seldom before and never since.\u201d Gaza is a small territory, but so is Qatar, whose population is smaller than Gaza\u2019s. And if Gaza is too small to host all the matches, why not also allow Ramallah, Cairo and even Tel Aviv to\u00a0host a few. The 2022 final should be played in Gaza, of course, and Gazans could rejoice in this, after decades of perceived humiliation. I suspect Israelis \u2013 so long as security was not an\u00a0issue \u2013 would welcome the idea with great enthusiasm. It would, one hopes, buy eight years of quiet, economic development and reconstruction in which the focus in Gaza could be taken off conflict with Israel and radical Islamism. An unusual idea? Perhaps.

It\u2019s just a step away from San Jorge, Chile\u2019s oldest orthodox church founded by the first Palestinian migrants in 1917. Here the elders sip their coffee and savour oriental pastries. The walls are covered with photographs of Beit Jala, the village from where most of the Palestinians in Chile originated. \u201cI\u2019m a third-generation Chilean,\u201d says landlord Juan Bishara. His grandfather arrived in the 1950s. He speaks mostly Arabic to his customers, apart from to the younger Spanish-speaking generation. The community has one secondary and two primary schools. \u201cOur neighbourhood is know as the Arab quarter, though a lot of shops are now run by more recent migrants, from Korea and Bolivia,\u201d he adds. Chile is home to the largest Palestinian community outside the Middle East. There are no official statistics but estimates suggest between 150,000 to 400,000 people of Palestinian origin from first- to third-generation migrants. In keeping with their ancestors, 95% are Christians, which has helped integration. More than three-quarters of them moved here between 1900 and 1930, mainly from four villages: Belen, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour and Beit Safafa. The parents of historian Juan Sakalha left the Christian village of Tayebh, 12km from Ramallah, in 1915, arriving in Valparaiso (120km north of Santiago) after a gruelling journey. They passed through Beirut, Marseille, Panama, S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires, crossing the Andes on donkeys. Most were small farmers or artisans, but literate. They settled in the capital and beyond. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single village in Chile lacking a curate, a policeman and a Palestinian,\u201d according to a well-known saying. In Santiago they chose Patronato because the rents were low and it was close to the main market. In 1910 newcomers headed for Jorge Shahuran\u2019s general store on the corner of Patronato and Santa Filomena. Here they could get assistance settling in and pass on news from home. The community started publishing its first paper, Al-Murshid, in 1912. Their greatest source of pride is the Club Deportivo Palestino professional football side. Established in 1920, it is the world\u2019s only top-division club to sport the Palestinian colours. It has its own ground, at La Cisterna. In January players replaced the number one on their jerseys with an elongated map of pre-1948 Palestine. They won their next three matches. But Chile\u2019s 17,000-strong Jewish community protested against such \u201cpolitical exploitation of soccer\u201d and accused the Palestinians of importing a conflict that they claimed had more to do with religion than territory. The Football Federation of Chile summoned Palestino president Maurice Khamis Massu and banned the jerseys, fining the club $15,000. The players then tattooed the map of Palestine on their forearms. The controversy became news across the world and now the club\u2019s jerseys, particularly number 11, have been selling like hot cakes. \u201cA win by Palestino is a joy for the suffering Palestinian people. The terrible events in Gaza have strengthened our links with Palestine and our roots,\u201d Massu says. He was three when his family arrived in Chile, following the creation of the state of Israel. He is a member of the Belen 2000 foundation, which awards scholarships to children in Palestine and sends doctors to work there. The Palestinian Federation of Chile is made up of several organisations including Palestino. It \u201chas gained in importance in recent years as the conflict over Gaza has deteriorated\u201d, president Mauricio Abu-Gosh says. \u201cOur aim is to raise public awareness of the Palestinian cause and promote the unity of the Palestinian community in Chile.\u201d     Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n side CD Palestino redesigned their shirts so that the number one was replaced by a map of pre-1948 Palestine. Photograph: Claudio Reyes/Getty    It is certainly influential, accounting for 10% of senate seats and 11% of the lower chamber, representing a broad political spectrum reaching from the Communist party to the Conservatives. Palestinians head nine local councils, and there are 26 municipal councillors of Palestinian origin. Deputy interior minister Mahmud Aleuy\u2019s family hails from Palestine. Abu-Gosh acknowledges the existence of a \u201chorizontal lobby\u201d that has scored several \u201cbig successes\u201d. In 2008 Chile welcomed 130 refugees fleeing the conflict in Iraq. The socialist president, Michelle Bachelet, held a reception for them at the Moneda palace, seat of the presidency, on the anniversary of al-Nakba (in May 1948, when Palestinians fled or were expelled from lands for the creation of Israel). Bachelet did not attend the ceremony at the Israeli embassy celebrating the creation of Israel. In 2011, the then conservative president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, visited Palestine and endorsed its claim to statehood. In August, as Israel resumed military operations against Gaza, Bachelet, re-elected in March, recalled the Chilean ambassador to Tel Aviv. Thousands of people demonstrated in Santiago in solidarity with Palestine. The ambassador only resumed his functions once a ceasefire had been arranged. Several neighbouring countries followed suit, the exception being Argentina, home to the largest Jewish community (250,000-strong) in Latin America. Gerardo Gorodischer, leader of the Jewish community in Chile, deplores \u201cthe confusion between Jews and Israel\u201d and the rise of \u201cantisemitism unprecedented in Chile\u201d. He goes so far as to say: \u201cWe are enduring a pogrom, without the Chilean government lifting a finger. The most prosperous people are thinking of moving to the United States.\u201d He claims that the Israeli flag was burned at several pro-Palestine demonstrations. Palestinian leaders maintain this was the work of \u201cradical groups which are not representative of the community\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a Chilean, a Palestinian and a communist,\u201d says Daniel Jahud, 47, leader of the local council at Recoleta, part of which overlaps with Patronato. He is proud of the fact that Salvador Allende, the socialist president overthrown by General Augusto Pinochet in 1973, should be buried in the district he governs. \u201cLooking back in history the various religious communities co-existed peacefully until the artificial creation of the Israeli state by Europeans,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conflict is not about religion. Relations are poor, not with Jews but with the Zionists who represent the Israeli government in Chile.\u201d Integration was difficult in Chile. The country was very conservative and treated the Palestinians as second-class immigrants, unlike the British, Germans and French who had won over the aristocracy. But despite cultural differences Palestinians were soon assimilated into the middle classes. Some families now command the biggest fortunes in the country. In the 1930s they built powerful textile industries, the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito e Inversiones and an insurance company. In the early years, in the face of hostility many Palestinians married outside their community and even in the 1970s this pattern was true of over two-thirds of marriages. Another, more upmarket rallying point for the community is the Palestinian Club at Las Condes, a residential neighbourhood. Founded in 2007 its parks and gardens spread over 11 hectares, with palm trees and superb views of the snow-capped peaks of the Andes. It has an Olympic-size swimming pool, tennis courts and football pitches but no oriental architecture. The club house is all timber and glass. Anuar Majluf, the club\u2019s thirtysomething head of communications, says he feels more Chilean than anything else, nevertheless acknowledging that the \u201cGaza conflict has rekindled the Palestinian identity in Chile\u201d.

But that\u2019s about the only dramatic principle to which the characters in Zero Motivation adhere. Normally that would be a problem, seeing as how this film is set in the army, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re on the battle lines. Writer-director Talya Lavie drew from her own personal experience in the Israeli Defense Forces, setting her first feature in the dullest administrative office in a remote desert base. The elevator pitch \u201cGirls meets M*A*S*H\u201d may seem a tad reductive, but it\u2019s apt. The angst is the same though the specifics, and urgency, has changed. \nThe Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Paper and Shredding, Daffi (Nelly Tagar), has devoted her life\u2019s efforts toward one goal: to transfer her compulsory military service to a base in Tel Aviv. Visions of walking amid gleaming towers in high heels are the only thing keeping her alive. This potential abandonment causes some stress for her pal Zohar (Dana Ivgy), a coarse and slightly unkempt fellow secretary/soldier whose sole job, it would seem, is playing Minesweeper on an outdated computer. Zohar is a Yossarian-esque rascal, the only one who can see that everyone else at the base is nuts. If Daffi goes, Zohar will be left alone with the twin ditzes who sing pop songs and twirl their gum, a brusque Russian immigrant who makes fatalist remarks in a voice so low certain dogs couldn\u2019t hear it and the by-the-book commander whose twin passions are paperwork and brown-nosing. It\u2019s a textbook case of an individual mortified by dense authority. If Bill Murray were a twenty-something Israeli woman, he\u2019d be Dana Igvy as the disheveled kibbutznik in Zero Motivation. \nThe bulk of the film plays out in episodic form (indeed, it is segmented in three chapters) but this sitcom-like setup serves a purpose. Characters weave in and out. Someone that seems key will drift away as someone that seemed merely a gag takes center stage for a while. This approach works well to underscore the feeling of a life in which unseen and inexplicable forces are in control. In time, Zohar\u2019s brusk exterior reveals an inner timidity beneath her khaki parka. She\u2019s actually a virgin, likely the only one on the base, and if dating weren\u2019t difficult enough these days try working that out as a new platoon of handsome paratroopers bunk down for just a few nights. \nThe comedy in Zero Motivation ranges from wordplay to visual gags to some \u201csaw that coming down Broadway\u201d moments of comeuppance. There is, however, an undercurrent of sadness, particularly with Rama (Shani Klein) the group leader. Clearly she\u2019s the foil \u2013 she keeps a framed photo of Margaret Thatcher on her wall \u2013 but it\u2019s not her fault her battalion of paper filers are the Bad News Bears of the Israeli desert, and the way in which the male officers disregard her smacks of unspoken sexism. She\u2019s passed over for a promotion for another woman, but are any men in her position asked to serve coffee? \nThere are no references to Hamas or Palestinians or Arabs or anything else connoting the unending conflict in the Middle East. Yet our bumbling leads are reminded time and again that \u201cwe are at war\u201d and \u201cour soldiers are dying\u201d. The only nod to headlines or history is a shot of a woman stapling up posters commemorating Israel\u2019s numerous conflicts from 1948 through to our current decade. The degree to which real danger and bloodshed is ignored in Zero Motivation adds a strange urgency what could otherwise be an Office Space-like lark. When the movie does take some dark turns, it\u2019s almost a relief. \nThere are some whose politics have no room for a film like this. \u201cThis is not a laughing matter\u201d, they\u2019ll say. This attitude negates reality, and perhaps negates storytelling in general. Zero Motivation is a shot of honesty, in which short-term goals are far more important than larger geo-political ones.

His first novel, John Crow\u2019s Devil, established him as an interesting local writer with an imagination markedly different from that of other Jamaican and Caribbean writers; he relished the darkness and gore rather than the sunshine and bouncy music. But John Crow\u2019s Devil, a small novel of hardly 200 pages, did not prepare anyone for what was to come next: The Book of Night Women.   Related: Marlon James wins the Man Booker prize 2015    Easily one of the best Jamaican novels ever written, The Book of Night Women, a slave narrative, is an incredible feat of plotting, pace and language. While it embraces a Jamaican dialect, it also established James as an international star. In every way, it is a bigger novel than John Crow\u2019s Devil; epic in scale, and written with far more narrative power and lyricism. James\u2019s new novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, tells the story of the attempted assassination of Bob Marley, who is referred to throughout as \u201cthe singer\u201d, and its aftermath. But perhaps more importantly, it tells the story of Jamaica in the 1970s and early 80s, when the guns flooded in, CIA agents took up residence, and the island went through one of its most violently defining moments. It is a story worth telling, and a story about Jamaica that doesn\u2019t only take place in Jamaica. If one were to be curmudgeonly, one might say that A Brief History is slightly more impressive for its ambition than its accomplishment. In John Crow\u2019s Devil and The Book of Night Women, the ambition and the accomplishment were perfectly matched. A Brief History, however, is sometimes more impressive than it is easily enjoyable \u2013 a difficult book with a stop-start structure that doesn\u2019t quite sweep you up in the way the single narrative voices of the previous novels did. Bakhtin saw the novel as the genre of polyphony, incorporating and orchestrating several competing voices. James seems to take this philosophy to heart, even extending it, and so in A Brief History of Seven Killings we find a novel of cacophony. The cast of characters presented at the beginning of the book totals around 75, several of them jumping in and out to tell their pieces of the story. The book brings together a variety of Jamaican experiences, which isn\u2019t to say that these experiences are local or parochial. James\u2019s invented ghetto of Copenhagen City, where many of the book\u2019s murders are plotted and take place, is worth a moment\u2019s consideration. Though the ghetto\u2019s name is an invention, it is reminiscent of actual places within the urban sprawl of Kingston, places such as Tel Aviv, Spain, Gaza and Angola \u2013 areas that exist within Jamaica but also refer to a wider world of conflict in which it participates. The names of some ghettoes, such as Tivoli Gardens, seem especially ironic, with the inspiration of the original being so far removed from the killing field the place has become. So too, James\u2019s Copenhagen City is no longer a peaceful Scandinavian landscape when it is placed in the hot tropics. James often brings the international within a national space. But most exceptional is his bringing together of a variety of Jamaican and American accents, and not for polite conversations, but to enter into the most brutal and bloody conflicts. In the wonderfully complex character of Josey Wales, we see James managing a range of language not only between characters but within a single character. Josey tells us of his meeting with CIA agents: \u201cI don\u2019t tell him that yo tengo suficiente espa\u00f1ol para concocer que eres la m\u00e1s gran broma en Sudam\u00e9rica. I chat to him bad like some bush naigger and ask dumb question like, So everybody in America have gun? What kinda bullet American fire? Why you don\u2019t transfer Dirty Harry to the Jamaican branch? hee hee hee.\u201d If the scope of James\u2019s talent has grown from book to book, his imagination is more consistent \u2013 that tendency to inhabit the dark and gory places, and to shine a light on them. Despite its title, this isn\u2019t a brief novel and neither are there a mere seven killings. Readers will flinch many more times than that. When reading reviews of Night Women, James apparently became bored with comparisons to Toni Morrison; and with A Brief History, he\u2019s got bored with comparisons to Quentin Tarantino. But it is hard not to see the strength of that comparison. This is a novel that explores the aesthetics of cacophony and also the aesthetics of violence. \u2022 Kei Miller\u2019s collection The Cartographer Tries to Map a Way to Zion is published by Carcanet.

Ziad Abu Ain, who dealt with the issue of Israeli settlements and the separation wall, died as he was being rushed to hospital after becoming involved in clashes with Israeli troops while trying to plant olive trees in the village of Turmusiya near Ramallah. Abbas described the attack as \u201ca barbaric act which we cannot be silent about or accept\u201d. He announced three days of national mourning and said he would take \u201cnecessary steps\u201d after an investigation. The death was also condemned by the Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Malki, who said that \u201cIsrael will pay\u201d for the \u201cmurder\u201d of Abu Ain. Reports said that Abu Ain, a senior figure on Fatah\u2019s revolutionary council, collapsed and died after being struck in the chest at an event where he also inhaled teargas fired by Israeli security forces. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Moshe Yaalon, issued a statement expressing \u201csorrow\u201d. \u201cThe event in which Ziad Abu Ain died is under investigation by the IDF,\u201d said Yaalon. \u201cWe have proposed a joint investigation to the Palestinian Authority and that a joint autopsy be carried out on Abu Ain\u2019s body. Security stability is important to both sides and we will continue coordination with the PA.\u201d Mohammed Mohesin, an assistant from Abu Ain\u2019s office who witnessed the incident and travelled in the ambulance to hospital, claimed that over the course of a few minutes one policeman grabbed Abu Ain by the throat, before he was assaulted by two other soldiers a little later. \u201cWhen we arrived at where we planned to plant, there were a large number of troops waiting for us who fired teargas,\u201d said Mohesin. \u201cHe went to talk to them and asking why they were blocking us. One soldier grabbed him by the throat. A few minutes later another one hit him in the throat while a third soldier with a helmet head butted him in the chest. \u201cHe was on the ground holding his chest but it appeared he could not recognise the people standing around him.\u201d Mohesin\u2019s description of the headbutt was also described by other eyewitnesses but could not be verified by the Guardian. Video footage of the confrontation \u2013 and still photographs \u2013 showed Abu Ain being held by the throat by a helmetless officer. A second photograph showed him being held by the shoulders by a border policeman wearing a helmet. An AFP photographer said he had seen Abu Ain struck in the chest. While some witnesses claimed the minister had been struck by a rifle butt, that was denied by an Israeli journalist present, Channel 10 reporter Roy Sharon, in a tweet. Abu Ain was taken to a local clinic then to hospital in Ramallah where he was pronounced dead. An Israeli officer quoted by the Jerusalem Post said there had originally been a minor confrontation over where demonstrators would be allowed to plant. \u201c[Soldiers] then saw a person collapsing. We see on footage from the incident a push [delivered by a border police officer],\u201d the officer said, adding, \u201cI say this with reservation as we are still investigating it.\u201d       Another photograph, published by the Palestinian Maan news website, showed Abu Ain lying on the ground after his collapse. Shortly before his death, Abu Ain had spoken to television reporters. \u201cThis is the terrorism of the occupation, this is a terrorist army, practising its terrorism on the Palestinian people,\u201d he told the official Palestine TV. \u201cWe came to plant trees on Palestinian land, and they launch into an attack on us from the first moment. Nobody threw a single stone.\u201d Confirming the minister\u2019s death, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official told the Guardian: \u201cHe had gone to plant olive trees in Turmusiya for international human rights day when Israeli soldiers arrived to oppress the demonstration. There are different versions circulating about what happened but he wasn\u2019t shot.\u201d The minister\u2019s death followed violent clashes in the area the night before, prompted by Israeli settlers\u2019 claims that a horse had been stolen. Palestinian villagers claim it was triggered by settlers stoning Palestinian cars. There have been months of violent unrest in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Ten Israelis and a foreign visitor have been killed by Palestinians over the past three months, while more than a dozen Palestinians have also been killed, including most of those who carried out the attacks. Abu Ain, 55, has previously been arrested and imprisoned by Israel. He was extradited from the United States in 1981 over the murder of two Israelis in Tiberias in 1979, and sentenced to life in prison, but released in 1985 in a prisoner exchange. Besides his role in the PA monitoring Israeli settlements and the separation barrier, Abu Ain was a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council and previously served as deputy Palestinian minister for prisoner affairs.", "publicationDate": "2014-12-10T18:40:00Z", "title": "Palestinian minister dies after West Bank confrontation with Israeli soldiers", "sentences": ["There have been months of violent unrest in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the Israeli-occupied West Bank."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/10/palestinian-minister-dies-confrontation-israeli-soldiers-west-bank"}, {"tags": ["Hip-hop", "Music", "Culture", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "     Last July in Tel Aviv\u2019s Habima Square, a peace demonstration against the Israeli military operation in Gaza was disrupted by counter-protesters, who assaulted the gathering while chanting \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d. The mob contained many of the usual suspects from Israel\u2019s far right, including members of the religious extremist movement Lehava. What was more surprising was the identity of the man who coordinated the attack: Yoav Eliasi, better known to the Israeli public by his rap name, The Shadow. Eliasi took to Facebook to encourage his followers to fight against \u201cIsrael-hating leftists\u201d and was pictured in newspapers marshalling the mob. The assault came less than a year after Eliasi\u2019s former recording partner Ya\u2019akov \u201cKobi\u201d Shimoni AKA Subliminal, in the wake of the murder of an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian man, had called on Israel to \u201cburn the prisons\u201d housing Palestinians and \u201cdestroy [the Palestinian city of] Jenin\u201d. For some critics, Eliasi and Shimoni\u2019s outbursts are indicative of what Asher Schechter, a journalist for the English-language newspaper Haaretz, describes as \u201ca deep process of right-leaning radicalisation\u201d in Israel, where the term \u201cleftist\u201d has assumed negative connotations and talk of reconciliation with the Palestinians is seen as defeatism. Yet, while Eliasi and Shimoni\u2019s viewpoint may chime with populist opinion, within Israeli hip-hop theirs is far from the only political stance. Unlike much of the national discourse, the scene is allowing voices from all sides of the spectrum to be broadcast, some confrontational, some conciliatory. Sameh Zakout AKA Saz is in the latter group. A Palestinian rapper who lives in Israel, he preaches a form of hip-hop that, while frank and frustrated about the treatment meted out to Palestinians, largely eschews the political minutiae for a wider message of unity. Last month, he was the lone Palestinian performer at Tune In Tel Aviv, a showcase designed to promote Israeli artists to the western market. Saz describes himself as an \u201cinternational ethnic rapper\u201d, and has the ambitious aim of being \u201cthe first Arab sex symbol to the world. It sounds corny, but I\u2019d rather be the bridge to bring people together than be the bomb that divides them.\u201d            The history of Israeli hip-hop runs back to the mid-90s, when the advent of cable TV introduced the likes of Tupac and Notorious BIG to a culture weaned on rock. \u201cBack then, everything was love songs with guitars,\u201d explains Khen Rotem AKA Sagol 59, a Jerusalem rapper considered to be one of Israeli hip-hop\u2019s progenitors. \u201cThere was no Hebrew hip-hop at all. We had to invent a language from scratch.\u201d A new style was forged in the clubs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where MCs would freestyle in both English and Hebrew. The first artists to capitalise on this nascent scene were Subliminal and The Shadow. \u201cIf you equate these things [to US hip-hop] they were like 50 Cent or Jay Z,\u201d explains Rhotem. \u201cBig beats, parties, swagger, but with a bit of nationalistic stuff. They cemented in the Israeli media the way an Israeli rapper should look and sound.\u201d That look and sound was unapologetically rightwing Zionist, supportive of the military and antagonistic towards both Palestine and the Israeli left. Such sentiments proved popular with Israeli audiences; Subliminal built a Jay Z-style empire, including a record label and a clothing line. Around the same time, the Palestinian hip-hop crew DAM emerged, led by rapper Tamer Nafar. Hailing from the impoverished Israeli city of Lod, DAM\u2019s worldview was strikingly different from that of Shimoni and Eliasi. They rapped in Arabic and their focus was on the plight of Palestinians, not only in Gaza and the West Bank, but also the significant number who, like them, lived in Israel and felt marginalised. In the early years, Nafar and Shimoni were friends. However, the events of the second intifada [2000\u2019s Palestinian uprising] intensified the political streak in both artists. Subliminal and his crew amped up their nationalist rhetoric, while DAM became more outspoken about the Israeli occupation. The relationship between the two crews deteriorated rapidly, a falling-out that is captured in the 2005 documentary Channels Of Rage.            If Subliminal and DAM are evidence of Israeli hip-hop\u2019s capability to divide, others are looking to use the scene as a unifying force. Sagol 59, a left-leaning rapper who grew up in a kibbutz, has spent much of his career trying to create a dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian rappers. He devised the Corner Prophets initiative, a regular club night in Jerusalem where anyone could MC. \u201cThere\u2019s no hierarchy,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf an Arab guy wanted to come and do his thing or an ultra-orthodox girl from a settlement wanted to say her thing, they could.\u201d Sagol 59 has also collaborated with Palestinian rappers, most recently in September at a concert arranged by the MasterPeace initiative in Amsterdam, where he took the stage with Saz in front of an audience of 17,000. While Sagol 59 and Saz are relative veterans, fresh voices are beginning to be heard in the region. System Ali are a collective featuring Israelis, Palestinians and Uzbeks who formed in a bomb shelter in the historic city of Jaffa. Rapping in Hebrew, Arabic, English and Russian, they rail against inequality in their home town, where forced demolitions have made both Jews and Arabs feel like second-class citizens. Elsewhere, groups such as Kafe Shahor Hazak represent the country\u2019s sizeable Ethiopean-Israeli population. Not everyone is political, though: Itay Lukach is an overweight rapper who makes comedy songs about his love of food and Pro Evolution Soccer. For Sagol, the growing plurality of voices on all sides is evidence of a decisive shift in the genre, one that allows people of all political stripes to express their views clearly and openly. \u201cI always say that Israeli hip-hop moved backwards to American hip-hop. American hip-hop started out on the streets and went really commercial. Here it was at first commercial and now it\u2019s going back to the underground stuff.\u201d Saz agrees: \u201cThere are young people who are coming up now and they\u2019re great because they\u2019re coming from the bottom of hip-hop. The golden rule they all adhere to is \u2018be yourself\u2019. Do not try to mimic American hip-hop. Be honest.

Liverpool and Manchester United fans will argue until we are all dust whether 2005 or 1999 was more unlikely, more exciting or just simply better but years before those two was the day Wolverhampton Wanderers were \u201ccrowned\u201d champions of the world. The idea that England were unrivalled kings of football lasted for nearly the first century of the game\u2019s existence and for at least the latter half of it this was a fib, a delusion. England gave football to the world but had problems letting go of it. Despite regularly losing to Scotland, Ireland and Wales in the early days of the Home Internationals, a staunch refusal to play in the early World Cups and then defeat by the USA when they did deign to compete in 1950, it took a pair of shellackings in the early 1950s to jolt the English out of the notion that they were the masters of this particular domain. In November 1953 the brilliant Hungary side featuring Ferenc Puskas, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis et al gave England \u201ca severe lesson in the arts of Association Football\u201d, according to Pat Ward-Thomas of the Guardian, describing the Mighty Magyars\u2019 6-3 victory at Wembley as \u201cprobably the finest exhibition of attacking play that has been seen in an international match in Britain.\u201d Billy Wright, the England and Wolves captain, was infamously likened to \u201ca fire engine going to the wrong fire\u201d by Geoffrey Green in the Times, after having his knickerbockers firmly pulled down by Puskas in this most chastening of beatings. This was England\u2019s first home defeat by \u201cinternational\u201d opposition but it was more than that: this was a destruction, an outclassing of such significant proportions that it could not be ignored. And then just to force the point home Hungary won the rematch in Budapest six months later 7-1. That same year Wolves were celebrating a discovery of their own: the installation of floodlights at Molineux. They were not the first club to make such a radical addition to their ground (Arsenal had lights on one stand in the 1930s and The Dell was the first to have permanent floodlights in 1950) but they were perhaps the first to take full advantage of this relative novelty, only just approved by the Football Association. Wolves arranged a series of high-profile \u201cinternational\u201d floodlit friendlies, in which top foreign sides of the day were invited to the Midlands to play past everyone\u2019s bedtime. A South African XI visited first and subsequent opponents included Celtic, Racing Club Avellaneda (the dominant Argentinian side of the late 1940s/early 1950s), Spartak Moscow and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Wolves prevailed in all of these friendlies, a 0-0 draw with First Vienna aside, particularly impressive in the 10-0 victory over Tel Aviv and a 4-0 defeat of Spartak, after which the Daily Record chuckled to themselves that the Russians had been \u201chammered and sickled\u201d.     Billy Wright and Ferenc Puskas lead the sides out before their historic meeting. Photograph: Colorsport/REX    However, the headline match of the series came on 13 December 1954, when the Hungarian titans Honved, featuring six of the side that so comprehensively taught England a lesson or two, were invited to face Wolves, who by this point were English champions under Stan Cullis. Honved had just won their fourth Hungarian league title, would go on to win a fifth and would surely have taken more had the team not been disbanded and scattered across Europe a few years later. In 1956 Honved travelled to a European Cup game in Bilbao but the team refused to return home after the collapse of the Hungarian Revolution and the invasion of Budapest by Soviet troops. They played the second leg on a neutral ground in Brussels, then existed as a nomadic touring team for a while but eventually most of the side, including Puskas, Kocsis and Zoltan Czibor, found new clubs, the first of course eventually joining Real Madrid and the latter two Barcelona. The Wolves game was considered such an event that the BBC broadcast the second half live on television, a highly unusual occurrence at the time. Before that only FA Cup finals and a handful of experimental broadcasts (almost exclusively from London, for logistical reasons) were deemed worthy. Indeed, the rare televised game was particularly exciting in the household of one George Best, eight at the time, who was inspired to support Wolves after watching. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a telly ourselves, so when I knew there was a game on, I would go and kick a ball on the wall outside my neighbour\u2019s house about 10 minutes before kick-off,\u201d Best wrote in his autobiography. \u201cHe was a man called Mr Harrison and naturally he would hear me kicking the ball against the wall. He also knew I was a football nut. But he would let me sweat until just before the game started and would then open the door and say casually as though the idea had just come to him: do you fancy coming in and watching the game with me? I was in the house like a shot but the next time Wolves were on the television we would play the whole charade again.\u201d As perhaps an illustration of the game\u2019s popularity, and in a foreshadowing of the sort of wrath irked members of the public can rain down on the media, the BBC received a number of complaints after the radio commentary of the game was prematurely \u201cfaded out\u201d by an over-efficient continuity announcer. According to the Guardian, \u201chundreds of football enthusiasts, angered by the fade-out, hammered every telephone line to Broadcasting House for nearly half an hour\u201d, and radio announcer Adrian Walker apologised to the listening public the following evening for the error. \u201cI do realise I made a mistake,\u201d said \u201ca very repentant\u201d Walker, \u201c... and needless to say I shall be very wary of doing it again.\u201d Imagine how the internet would have reacted to that one. Despite the attention the game initially looked like being something of a non-event. Honved sashayed into a 2-0 lead by the 14th minute, a Puskas free-kick teeing up Kocsis to head in the first, the goalscorer then setting Ferenc Machos through to double the advantage. At that point it looked as if the extent of Wolves\u2019 ambitions was to keep the score down, with the goalkeeper, Bert Williams, pulling off a number of fine saves (saves that would serve as inspiration to a 16-year-old Gordon Banks). However, after the early blitz Wolves edged their way back into the game, only to be frustrated by the Hungarians. \u201cWolverhampton gradually took command of the midfield play, but they could not find a clear path to goal,\u201d reported the Guardian. \u201cStill nothing went right for Wolverhampton in front of goal,\u201d a point emphasised by a golden chance just before the break, as full-back Les Smith sliced an easy opportunity wide, leaving Honved still up at half-time. The teams came out for the second half \u201cfive minutes late\u201d, noted a watch-tapping Guardian, although there was enough time for a rather quaint show of appreciation from the home crowd for Honved\u2019s keeper Lajos Farago, who was given \u201ca special cheer as he ran up to take his position, recognising his fine work in keeping Wolverhampton out in the exciting first half\u201d. From that point, though, the conditions began to take their toll, at least in part thanks to some slightly underhand tactics on the part of the hosts. In order to combat the brilliant Honved forward line Cullis wanted the Molineux pitch to be \u201cnice and heavy\u201d, so he dispatched some of his staff to water turf already sodden from four days of persistent rain. Those who trudged out, armed with watering cans, included Ron Atkinson, a Wolves apprentice at the time. \u201cHonved came out to play in their short shorts and T-shirts with lightweight boots,\u201d Atkinson said, years later. \u201cThey were 2-0 up in no time, playing delightful football. Wolves with their billowy shirts, long shorts and big heavy boots seemed so ponderous in comparison. Yet Honved slowly but surely began to get bogged down in the increasing mud and Wolves with their characteristic long-ball style gradually began to grind down the Hungarians ... There is no doubt in my mind that, had Cullis not ordered me and my mates to water the pitch, Honved would have won by about 10-0.\u201d The Daily Mail described the pitch as \u201clike a cattle ground at the end of a four-day show in the rain.\u201d As the visitors\u2019 strength was sapped Wolves grew and stormed back into the game. Farago made two good saves before he was beaten in the 49th minute, Johnny Hancocks (the forward notable for being 5ft 4in tall and having size three feet) converting a penalty he won after going down rather easily from a push on the right side of the area. The pressure grew and grew, Honved defending \u201cdesperately\u201d and were reduced to preventing one attack by nefarious means, when centre-half Gyula Lorant \u201cbrought a ball down with his hands to prevent [centre-forward Roy] Swinbourne breaking through the middle.\u201d They were breached at last in the 75th minute, when Swinbourne rose to head home and a minute later the same player sealed the victory with an emphatic finish after being put clean through. It was not just a triumph of a grit over skill, though. Puskas did little aside from set up the first goal, even forced to drift out to the left wing for a spell to look for some space, perhaps because of the magnificent performance by Wright. The Guardian called him a \u201ctower of strength\u201d, stopping the \u201coccasional Honved thrusts down the middle and urging his men on to greater effort\u201d. After his humiliation at the hands of the Magyars 13 months previously this was at least some redemption for the great defender.

Photograph: David Bagnall/REX    Cullis would tell a story that after the game, his assistant Joe Gardiner was talking to one of Honved\u2019s coaches, who asked after where Wolves got a few of their players from, including Williams, Hancocks and winger Dennis Wilshaw. It so happened that all three had been recruited from Walsall, who finished second-bottom of Division Three South that year, prompting the coach to exclaim: \u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t play Walsall tonight!\u201d This victory, along with the win over Spartak, was seized on by the English press, a sign that despite the dual beltings at the hands of the Hungarian national side, England still ruled the game. The Daily Express reckoned it proved English football was still \u201cthe genuine, original, unbeatable article ... still the best of its kind in the world\u201d; the Daily Mirror ran with \u201cWolves the Great\u201d; and the Daily Mail infamously dubbed Wolves \u201cchampions of the world\u201d. This, for those still smarting from the national team giving England what for, was the real quiz. The press from further afield were not so convinced. Gabriel Hanot, a former French international and editor of L\u2019Equipe, wrote: \u201cBefore we declare that Wolverhampton are invincible, let them go to Moscow and Budapest. And there are other internationally renowned clubs: Milan and Real Madrid to name but two. A club world championship, or at least a European one \u2013 larger, more meaningful and more prestigious than the Mitropa Cup [a forerunner of the European Cup that featured only eastern and central European teams] and more original than a competition for national teams \u2013 should be launched.\u201d Hanot and other French journalists, notably Jacques Ferran who had travelled to South America and witnessed the Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones, the precursor to the Copa Libertadores, had been kicking the idea of a continent-wide tournament around for a few years, and Wolves\u2019 victories seemed to jump-start the process. A Uefa congress in March 1955 proposed such a competition and the following season the European Cup was born. In a fashion typical of English football\u2019s parochialism of the time, English teams were not permitted to enter in the competition\u2019s first year, champions Chelsea the team to miss out, only for the penny to drop in time for Manchester United to enter in 1956-57, when they reached the semi-finals. Wolves themselves played in the new competition twice, knocked out in the first round in 1958-59, then brutalised in the quarter-finals by Barcelona the following year. Indeed, in that tie Kocsis gained a chilled slice of revenge when he scored a hat-trick for Bar\u00e7a as they hoyed Wolves out of the competition, the treble coming in their 5-2 second leg win at Molineux, completing a 9-2 aggregate victory. The 60th anniversary of the game is on Saturday, and the occasion is being commemorated by the Champions of the World Project, a scheme financed by the Heritage Lottery Fund and supported by the Wolves Museum and National Football Museum. An exhibition at Molineux was opened last weekend with Ron Flowers, who played for Wolves that night, Cullis\u2019s son Andrew and Wright\u2019s daughter Babette in attendance, displaying items such as the shirt goalscorer Swinbourne wore on the night. The plan is to create an oral history of the game, with people encouraged to share their memories of the match, from which a series of DVDs and a book will be produced. The exhibition will be running until the end of the season. Every few weeks over the first half of any modern season, we can take our pick of 16 games a week to watch the best sides in Europe face each other. The ubiquity of such high-level football makes it tricky to gauge properly what impact a friendly 60 years ago could have but this was an event with such a rarity and mystique that it is remembered over half a century later.
